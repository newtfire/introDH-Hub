"6ETU9XWR","book","1993","","Medieval Culture and Society","","978-0-88133-747-1","","","","This anthology of judiciously selected sources concerned with medieval society and culture presents an intriguing view of Western society from its emergence as a distinctively ""European"" culture in the early Middle Ages (ca. 500-1000), to the burgeoning scholarship and literary and artistic expression of the central Middle Ages (ca. 1000-1350), and the dislocations and disasters of the closing Middle Ages (ca. 1350-1500). The documents presented for each period are intended to serve two purposes: an initial selection illustrates the society and the social milieu of the period, while the second group of readings provides examples of the chief forms of literary expression and illuminates some of the characteristic cultural attitudes of the age. Many ideas and ideals of the Middle Ages have exerted a permanent influence upon the culture of the modern world and have been a permanent source of enrichment for it. Readers will come away from this collection moved to a deeper appreciation of this truly fascinating period of history, as well as a wider interest in the rich and still living heritage of the medieval world.","1993-01-01","2025-03-24 17:53:13","2025-03-24 17:53:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Waveland Pr Inc","","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Culture-Society-David-Herlihy/dp/0881337471","physical","","Herlihy, David","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QETHW5G2","book","2018","Hartnell, Jack; Wellcome Collection","Medieval Bodies: life, death, and art in the Middle Ages","","978-1-78125-679-4","","","","Dripping with blood and gold, fetishized and tortured, gateway to earthly delights and point of contact with the divine, forcibly divided and powerful even beyond death, there was no territory more contested than the body in the medieval world. In Medieval Bodies, art historian Jack Hartnell uncovers the complex and fascinating ways in which the people of the Middle Ages thought about, explored and experienced their physical selves. In paintings and reliquaries that celebrated the - sometimes bizarre - martyrdoms of saints, the sacred dimension of the physical left its mark on their environment. In literature and politics, hearts and heads became powerful metaphors that shaped governance and society in ways that are still visible today. And doctors and natural philosophers were at the centre of a collision between centuries of sophisticated medical knowledge, and an ignorance of physiology as profound as its results were gruesome. Like a medieval pageant, this striking and unusual history brings together medicine, art, poetry, music, politics, cultural and social history and philosophy to reveal what life was really like for the men and women who lived and died in the Middle Ages","2018","2025-03-24 17:52:33","2025-03-24 17:52:33","","","345","","","","","Medieval Bodies","","","","","Profile Books : Wellcome Collection","London","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","GT495 .H37 2018","OCLC: 1019639579","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/25338936","physical","History; Social aspects; Social aspects History; Civilization, Medieval; History, Medieval; Human body; Human Body; Medicine in the Arts; Medicine, Medieval; Medieval","","","","Wellcome Collection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
