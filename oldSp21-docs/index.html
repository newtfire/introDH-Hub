      <p>We are writing HTML in the XHTML syntax, which means that all elements (including self-closing elements like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) must indicate how they close.
      All elements in XHTML syntax must have a start tag and an end tag, or indicate that they are self-closing.

        <h3>A <strong>third-level</strong> heading just to see what that looks like</h3>
        <p>HTML code has <em>lower-level</em> headings like from h2 to h6, but use them in order as you create subsections! 
            You can control the size, position, color, font, and more of headings (and any HTML display elements) using CSS.</p>
        <p>When should I use <b>bold</b> vs. <strong>strong</strong> in HTML code? These are <dfn>inline</dfn> elements.</p>
        <p> Other HTML elements like the <dfn>p</dfn> (for paragraph) or the heading level elements, or ordered and unorderd lists, or img elements make
            blocks on the page and are known as <dfn>block</dfn> elements.</p>
