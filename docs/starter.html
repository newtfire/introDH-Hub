         The top lines in this file declare the DOCTYPE, which is preferred by web browsers. In the HTML root element
    we see a namespace that declares this HTML to be written using XML syntax. That is also preferred for our courses as a neat and orderly code
    with clear syntax.

        <h1>Hello again, world!</h1>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text. 
            Here is <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external website</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the page.</p>
        
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>

        <h2>Starter HTML instructions</h2>
        
        <p>Let's replace the old index.html in your GitHub repo with this new one as you're starting to learn HTML. The hardest part of this may be learning how to browse
        to find where you saved your files in your GitHub repo. You'll get used to this with practice and some organization.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In oXygen, go to File >> Save As, and <b>carefully browse</b> to find your GitHub repo and its <strong>docs/</strong> directory.</li>
            <li>Save this file inside your docs/ directory as <b>index.html</b>. You should save over any index.html you've already saved there to replace with this one.
                (Don't capitalize index.html, spelling counts and you need the .html part at the end.)</li>
            <li>Open your Bash shell (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) at your GitHub repo.</li>
            <li>Use your git commands now. Check the <em>status</em> of your repo, <em>add</em> your files for staging, <em>commit</em> them with a message, and <em>push</em> them to the repo.</li>
            <li>Check your GitHub repo on the <q>code view</q> and the web view to see your updates.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>For a more detailed view of HTML, look at <a href="index.html">the actual index.html on this introDH-Hub model website</a>. Feel free to work with that code as you're learning HTML.</p>
        <p>The easiest way we know to create a new page for your site is to save the current one you're working on with a new filename in the same directory. 
            Open the new file so you can keep working. You'll need to create <a href="innerPage.html">a special kind of relative link to connect the pages</a>, like this.</p>
    </body>
