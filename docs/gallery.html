        <p>Try using a mouse or two fingers to expand the view and turn around to take a close look around my office! This was made from Scaniverse on an iPhone XS Max (no lidar), and annotated using Thinglink, thanks to Penn State's subscription to this 3D annotation software.</p>

                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                    Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                    unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                    book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
                    recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                    versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
