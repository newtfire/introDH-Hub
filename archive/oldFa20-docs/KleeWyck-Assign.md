# Comparative Analysis of Alterations to the *Klee Wyck* sketches

This is an exercise in sampling and curating text data and setting it up for a comparison view using tools within Google Docs.

Emily Carrâ€™s book, *Klee Wyck*, was first published in 1941, and later published again in 1951 after her death in an altered version for reading in Canadian public schools.
We will sample the 1941 book and the 1951 book from the origin points posted below. Locate the plain text file version of each, **right-click and download** locally to your computer.

* [1941 first edition of *Klee Wyck*](https://www.fadedpage.com/books/20171241/html.php)
* [1951 "educational edition" of *Klee Wyck*](http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100131.txt) 

When you have *downloaded* each file and saved it on your computer, open it in a plain text editor (TextEdit on Mac, Notepad or Notepad++ on Windows, or oXygen if you have it).
Begin skimming through the sketches, looking through them in any order, and take some time to read a few of them in each version.

Select a passage of up to 1 - 5 sketches that seem like the might contain some significant differences.

**For each** edition of Klee Wyck, save a copy of the passage you selected and give it a filename that clearly indicates the contents, as in 

* 1941-Ucluelet-to-Skedans.txt
* 1951-Ucluelet-to-Skedans.txt

Go to your Google Drive for DIGIT 110, and open a new Google Doc for each sketch. 
* Paste the text of the 1941 edition in one (and give it the same filename).
* Paste the text of the 1951 edition in the second document (and give it the same filename, so you can easily tell one from the other.)

Open the 1941 edition in your Google Doc, go to the "Tools" menu, and select the "Compare" tool. Browse to find your saved copy of the 1951 sketches at this point.

Look through the tracked changes one by one and try to assess what you're seeing. Which changes seem the most significant? What do you think the alteration means: was there damage done to the text?
Or how do the alterations change what we are reading?
