# introDH-Hub
shared repo for DIGIT 100: Introduction to Digital Humanities class at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College

Welcome to the introDH-Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient DIGIT students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <https://newtfire.org/courses/introDH/>

In order for you to participate fully in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. [Set up your own GitHub account](https://github.com) and write to me to tell me how to find you.

There are things we will do together only in the webpage view of GitHub: See if you can find the ”Issues” area by mousing over the icons on the top of the GitHub page: We're using the "Issues" page to open conversations about questions, problems, things we need to discuss and fix and work on together. The Issues are searchable, and you write in them using markdown syntax, which lets you easily and quickly format headings, lists, bold, italics, or share an image, etc.

## More advanced work with command line git 
If you are a DIGIT major, in other classes (DIGIT 110, 210, 400), you'll be working extensively with git and GitHub on coding projects, and you will be learning command line git and GitHub. If you want, feel free to start learning and practicing here with our introDH-Hub. 

 When you have set up an account and have installed the git tools (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash shell (Windows) locally on your computer, you are ready to experiment with git commands. Here is a quick and handy list of git commands: <https://github.com/newtfire/introDH-Hub/blob/master/GitCommands.md>
You can read our detailed guide to get started with Git (or just use this as we do, like a reference to search in for information): <https://newtfire.org/courses/tutorials/explainGitShell.html>  First, you can "clone" this repository on your local computer, and then work with it as a local file directory. Always be sure to sync your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. At command line, that means, issue a **"git pull"** (or a "git fetch" and "git merge") command to retrieve changes to the directories from the cloud *before* you begin working. Always sync your local directory with our cloud directory here on the web when you begin work, and when you conclude work at a local computer.

When you are ready to make changes (adding, deleting, moving files), you will go through the sequence of **git add**, **git commit -m "...."**, and **git push**.  Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space. To do this, first **commit** your changes and write the required commit message. Then you must **push** in order to sync these changes to the GitHub cloud.
