# Setting up a Kumu.io network

Kumu.io is network analysis software is designed to pull together resources and organize them to be shared on the web. 
This is *network analysis* software, which involves helping to visually organize *connecting relationships or interactions* between distinct *nodes*. 
To work with Kumu.io, you set up a free account, and you can work with a Google Sheet to organize data for import. That is what we will be doing.

1) Begin by creating an account: 
2) Then, copy [my starter Kumu template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lV4rAvh-LyLYF0fC1TSGdPMbELpE3bLjF8EVOCVkZuU/edit?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive space. Here are Kumu's instructions:

```
    * Click the "Share" button in the upper right
    * Click "Get shareable link"
    * Set the permissions to "On - public on the web (Anyone on the internet can find and access. No sign-in required.)"
    * Copy the shareable link URL, and go back to your Kumu map
    * Click the green  button, select Import, and click the "Google Sheets" tab
    * Paste your Google Sheets link into the box under Link to public Google Sheet
```


Once you have worked out how to organize data into columns and customize displays of of your network, work on designing a network that organizes relationships. 

Your network should be developed from Elements with a coherently organized set of Types and Tags, and you should provide images and descriptions for at least the most important nodes. Elements can be anything you find significant: characters, objects, events, locations, shared identities, etc. Your network could show, for example, how characters are connected to other characters by means of objects.

You do not have to plot out every kind of relationship imaginable, but choose to follow specific patterns and try to do so completely by finding everything of a kind. (If you are going to comment on character’s connected to objects, try to make sure you are capturing every object as it changes hands.)

Choose the words you use for the Type and Tags columns with care to help you make an easily readable visualization. It’s best if the categorical words you apply for Types and Tags are reusable at least once. Run the Social Network Analysis function in Kumu to generate metrics to use in sizing your nodes and weighting your connections.
