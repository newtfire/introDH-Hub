Reggie Jackson 's " indefinite suspension " by the New York Yankees became a five-day ban yesterday that will keep the slugging star out of uniform for four games . Jackson and Manager Billy Martin , who imposed the original suspension Monday night , flew west yesterday , occupying different airplanes and heading for destinations that were as far apart actually as the manager ana nis player have been spiritually for a season and a half . Martin led the Yankees to Minnesota , where they are to play tonight without Jackson . Jackson flew home to Oakland , Calif. , to sit out his suspension without pay for " deliberately disregarding the manager 's instructions . " ' Indefinite ' Yields to 5 Days Martin , who became so enraged over Jackson 's behavior during a bunting episode Monday night that he flung a clock radio and a beer bottle against a clubhouse wall after the game , at firstsuspended Jackson indefinitely . Then yesterday , to conform to baseball rules that require a specific period , the Yankees made the suspension five days , lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day off ( yesterday ) and four games , costing him $9,273.75 of his $332,000 annual salary . Martin was believed to have favored keeping Jackson under suspension for at least a week . However , the team president , Al Rosen , recommended that Jackson be reinstated before the team returns to New York next Wednesday . George Steinbrenner , the Yankees ' owner , totally backed Martin 's suspension of Jackson . " I 'm sure there are mitigating circumstances on both sides , " Steinbrenner said , " but the basic thing has to be the discipline of the ball club . There have to be a boss and a leader and Billy is the boss and leader of this ball club . " Everybody knows that Reggie is close to me . He 's a good friend . But you 've got to back the manager . If you do n't , you get to the point where a player can listen the manager and disregard what he says . Then you 're done . You might as well hang it up . " Steinbrenner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team , adding , " I hope it makes them understand that the rules are going to be enforced without exception . No one is an individual operator out there . " Changes Bother Jackson " This is probably the best thing that 's happened in a long time , " the manager said of the suspension 's significance to the team . " It 'll pull the team together . If you took a poll , I think you 'd find the players unanimous ? 100 percent . " Martin and Jackson have tangled since Steinbrenner signed the slugger as a free agent on Nov. 29 , 1976 for five years at $2.9 million . More recently , the front office , where Jackson had his staunchest ally in . Steinbrenner , appeared to have soured on Jackson 's abilities and his presence . " I do n't think they feel he can play baseball anymore , " a close friend of Jackson said yesterday . " It 's affecting Reggie . A situation like this tends to take the fun out of baseball . Though he gives 110 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this situation . I think the suspension is a good thing , though . It 'll give him time to sit down and think things through and get his head together . " Jackson , who was last season 's World Series hero , has been quietly seething since June 26 , when , with front-office approval , he was transformed from a full-time right fielder to a part-time designated hitter and from the fourth hitter in the lineup to the sixth hitter . The change meant he only batted and did not play the outfield . Jackson had not disclosed his true feelings about the change in status , but that was what most observers felt he was doing in the 10th inning against Kansas City on Monday night , when he ignored Martin 's orders to hit away and instead tried to bunt three times . If that was an act of defiance ? Jackson denied that it was ? it apparently was not the only one a Yankee committed that night . According to Chuck Hiller , a Kansas City coach , Graig Nettles of the Yankees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifth and sixth innings for New York in relief of Catfish Hunter , had taken himself out of the game . According to Hiller , Nettles said Lyle walked into the dugout after the sixth inning , tossed his glove down , said . " I 'm no long-relief man , " and disappeared into the clubhouse . Jackson 's apparent act of defiance came in the 10th inning with Thurman Munson on first base , no one out , and the game tied at 5-5 . Martin flashed the bunt sign on the first pitch , hoping that Jackson would advance Munson to second base , but Al Hrabosky 's fastball whizzed past Jackson 's head . Martin then removed the bunt sign ( " The infield was in , " he explained ) , but Jackson tried unsuccessfully to bunt the second pitch anyway . At that point Dick Howser , the third-base coach , walked in to tell Jackson that Martin wanted him to hit away . " I 'm going to bunt , " Howser quoted Jackson as telling him . " Ile wants you to swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the plate and fouled off two more bunt attempts , popping out to Darrell Porter , the catcher , on the second . The Yankees did not score and eventually lost in 11 innings , 9-7 . " I was shocked , " Martin said yesterday , still bristling at the thought of what he had seen 15 hours earlier . " I understood what he was doing . Here was a player defying me and his teammates It . stinks . " Jackson , however , denied that he had bunted defiantly . He contended he did it strategically . " I tried to get a runner over and it looks like I 'm defiant , " the 32-year-old slugger said after the game . " I was trying to move the guy over . Does that make me a bad guy ? I figured if I could get the man in scoring position with Lou Piniella coming up , we 'd have a pretty good chance of winning the game . " If I strike out or pop up , that 's not helping us . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm not an everyday player . I 'm a part-time player . " When someone mentioned the possibility of suspension , Jackson was incredulous , but at that very minute , Martin was meeting in his closed-door office with General Manager Cedric Tallis , who was on the telephone with Steinbrenner and Rosen , who were in the executive offices at Yankee Stadium . The topic of their conversation was suspension . Martin Regains Composure When the door opened , Martin , still visibly upset but much calmer than he had been half an hour earlier , when it was obvious he had been crying in rage , read a statement in which he explained the " indefinite " suspension . Asked if he would talk to Jackson ? he had not to that point ? Martin said , " I 'm the manager . I do n't talk about it . If he comes back again , he does exactly as I say . Period . I 'm not getting paid $3 million . I do n't disobey my boss ' orders . He tells me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be anyone who defies the manager or management in any way . Nobody 's bigger than this team . " Slugger Avoids Reporters Shortly afterward , reporters informed Jackson of his suspension . He took the news calmly , saying he intended to go home . He headed there yesterday on a noon flight from John F. Kennedy Airport , sneaking out of his Fifth Avenue apartment building the back way to avoid a horde of photographers and cameramen . At the airport in California , he reportedly deplaned from a different exit and avoided reporters there , too . Jackson met with Steinbrenner for 90 minutes Monday afternoon ? well before the incident ? and some people speculated that he had asked to be traded . However , Steve Kay , his lawyer , said from California yesterday , " He did not ask to be traded . He does not want to be traded . He simply wanted to understand the situation about being a part-time player . "                    @
