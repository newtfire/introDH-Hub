How will the Administration 's energy plan be carved up on the Hill , and who are the key figures who will sit in judgment on it ? <P> <P> THE HOUSE : Carter 's staunchest congressional ally is the most powerful : Speaker Thomas ( " Tip " ) O'Neill . From the start , O'Neill has feared that conflicting regional interests in Congress could ruin the overall plan by bargaining on individual points . Warned O'Neill : " The only way we can write a national bill is if they do n't team up . If they logroll you , you 're in trouble . " <P> The threat of logrolling is increased by the fact that pieces of Carter 's program will go to eight or more committees ( including Ways and Means , Commerce , Banking , Interior , Science and Technology , and Public Works ) . To make sure the House produces a comprehensive bill , O'Neill has created yet another committee-the Ad Hoc Committee on Energy . Normally , the regular committees would send their recommendations to the floor piecemeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations into one omnibus bill . More important , perhaps , the new committee will have the power to offer its own amendments to the basic bill , and could even go so far as to put forward an entirely new version . <P> Hoping to avoid parliamentary chaos , O'Neill has carefully selected the 27 Democrats on the committee from a startling total of 140 volunteers . ( There are also 13 Republican members picked by House Minority Leader John Rhodes . ) The roster includes chairmen of some of the committees dealing with energy , including Oregon 's Al Ullman , head of Ways and Means , who is one of the few lawmakers who think that the proposal for a progressive gas tax will pass . Another key member : Interior 's Mo Udall , who favors Carter 's program , although he wishes it included one of his favorite goals-breaking up the oil companies . A majority of the 40 committee members will probably back the Administration 's bill ; less than one-fourth of the members represent oil and gas states . <P> The man chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio 's Thomas Ludlow Ashley , 54 , a loyal ally of the Speaker 's and a popular , buoyant and diligent legislator . O'Neill also picked Ashley because he is an independent on energy ( although he comes from Toledo , which has auto plants ) and thus may be able to moderate the inevitably conflicting views . Does Ashley see the potential national disaster that Carter envisions ? " Yes , I honest-to-God do , " says he . Ashley plans to deliver a bill to the House floor by the end of July . He notes : " There 'll be no dawdling . I have some confidence in the House . It can rise above parochialism-and it has-and can act in the national interest . " <P> THE SENATE : Majority Leader Robert Byrd has strongly endorsed Carter 's plan , but he must deal with the worries of some of the staunchest Democrats . Massachusetts ' Edward Kennedy , for example , fears that the President 's proposals may slip new " loopholes " for business into the tax code . Byrd 's own majority whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state in the Union , and Cranston has already expressed doubts about the standby gasoline tax .
