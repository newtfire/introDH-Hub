" Any truthful declaration on the Cabinet members will be announced by me , and all other statements will be based on theory and conjecture . " So said the President-elect , without in the least deterring theory and conjecture . <P> Borah or Morrow for State ; Mellon for Treasury ; D. F. Davis for War ; the present Wilbur 's brother for the Navy ; Donovan for Attorney-General ; New or Good for Postmaster-General ; Work again for Interior ; J. J. Davis for Labor ; one of three Juliuses-Klein , Barnes , Rosenwald - for Commerce ; some midwesterner for Agriculture , perhaps Publisher Dante Melville Pierce of Des Moines-so ran theory and conjecture . A " truthful declaration " was not expected for some time , perhaps not until the President-elect 's return from South America ( see page 8 ) . <P> The theorists and conjecturers wondered how the Republican South would be recognized , what new Californians might be taken to Washington , whether Mrs. Willebrandt would get her long-sought judgeship , etc. , etc . Upon two basic matters , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics , a maximum of fitness ; and that many an oldtime Hoover man would be recalled . <P> Decentralization is a prime tenet of the Hoover theory of administration-dividing the work into parts and making one person responsible for each part . He would rather appoint a director of this and a director of that and let them choose assistants than entrust this-and-that in one lump to a commission . Radio is an example . Last week radiowners throughout the U. S. made out new dialing charts as a result of the Federal Radio Commission 's reassignment of station wavelengths . Perhaps the new charts will serve for some time , perhaps they will need changing again before Christmas . In the Hoover view , radio 's difficulties would be better handled in the Department of Commerce , where radio regulation rested before Congress declined Mr. Hoover 's advice . It would not be surprising to hear him as President recommend to Congress what it refused him as Secretary . If Congress complied , radio might then be put under some oldtime Hoover man , one of the scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his various large undertakings of the past 20 years . <P> A Hoover man is not a single type . What makes him a Hoover man is that so many of him have been chosen with such uniform success , that so many of him have credited their success to the confidence and co-operation of " the Chief . " A Hoover man is usually a recognized expert in his line before he qualifies for work in that line under Hoover . He is usually an expert with creative theories of his own , or enthusiasm for Hoover theories , besides technical knowledge . He is likely to be an idealist with a social aim , rather than a practitioner of skilled self-interest . Typical Hoover men are George Barr Baker , publicist ; Archibald Wilkinson Shaw , commercial economist ; Dr. Vernon Lyman Kellogg , zologist . The latter , permanent Secretary of the National Research Council , may be taken as the ideal Hoover man .
