 That this is a sane attitude is sometimes more easily shown in the field of language than of culture . This is because language is primarily a mechanism or means , whereas in culture ends or purposes obtrude more . It is thus easier to view linguistic phenomena dispassionately . Grammars and dictionaries , for instance , are evidently the result of self-consciousness arising about speech which has previously been mainly unconscious . They may be roughly compared to social formulations like law codes or written constitutions or philosophical systems or religious dogmas , which typically begin also as representations of usages or beliefs already in existence . When moralists about language stigmatize expressions like ai n't or them cows or he do n't as " wrong , " they are judging an innovation , or one of several established but conflicting usages , by a standard of correctness that seems to them absolute and permanent , but which is really only the hallmark of a class or a locality to which they choose to give priority . As a matter of actuality , the condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He do n't , for example , might in time attain to " correctness "  --  meaning social reputability  --  although ai n't is perhaps less likely to become legitimized , and them cows , though old , to have still smaller prospect of ultimate general recognition . That a form departs from the canon of today of course no more proves that it will be accepted in future than that it will not . What is certain is that if it wins sufficient usage by the right people , it will also win sanction , and will become part of the standard of its time . Linguistic instances like these differ little if at all in principle , in their involved psychology , from the finding of the Supreme Court that a certain legislative enactment is unconstitutional and therefore void , or from the do cision of a religious sect that Sunday baseball is wicked . The chief point of divergence would seem to be that a court is a constituted body endowed with an authority that is not paralleled on the linguistic side , at any rate in Anglo-Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on correct ness of speech enjoy a moral authority  --  though a sanctionless one  --  appruximating the verdicts of a high court . And it is notorious that courts and religious denominations , like speech purists , may begin by condemning and yet eta ! by tolerating or even accepting innovations , after actual usage of the times has drifted far enough . Witness the fates of the American income tax , Methodist dancing , and the rule that prepositions are not words to end sentences wit h ! It is also of interest to remember that the power of nullifying legislation was not specifically granted the Supreme Court by the Constitution of the United States , but that the practice grew up gradually , quite like a speech in novation that becomes established .

The majority , on the other hand , feel that the situation on the whole works out well , and that a Supreme Court with its present powers is better than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it re.mains curiously illogical that the preservation of the Constitution should take // place partly through the extraconstitutional functioning of a constitutional body . In principle such a case is similar to that of grammarians who at the same time lay down a " rule " and exceptions to the rule , because the contradictory usages happen to be actually established . Codes , dogmas , and grammars are thus normally reflections , secondary rather than primary causes . Such influence as they have is mainly in outward crystallization . They produce an appearance of permanence . In the field of speech , it is easy to recognize that it is not grammarians that make languages , but languages that make grammarians . The analogous process evidently holds for culture . Lawgivers , statesmen , religious leaders , discoverers , inventors seem to shape civilization when actually they much more express it . The complex and often obscure forces that shape culture also mold the so-called creative leaders of society as essentially as they mold the mass of humanity . Progress , so far as it exists objectively , can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make as we set out to make it . Our frequent assumption to the contrary is probably the result of a reluctance to realize our individual nearimpotence as regards remodeling the culture we live in , as contrasted with the overpowering molding we receive from it . But how much does any one of us create or shape or alter his language ? Culture no doubt is a bit more malleable ; but the comparison with speech should make us cautious not to overrate our capacity for initiative . Undoubtedly we do have social influence as individuals . It is an influence on the fortune and the careers of other individuals , sometimes on larger segments of society , and it is concerned largely with aims of personal security , relative dominance , or affection among ourselves . We also have many choices among the alternatives contained in our culture and in our speech . To some extent we can manipulate certain alternatives and ambiguities of the culture in our personal favor , or in the direction of our ideals . Now and then , perhaps , we succeed in establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or idea or idiom , some novel twist of custom or phrase . That seems to describe the range of our exertion of influence on the form or content of those mass products and mass influences which we call civilization and language . II2 . WHAT CULTURE IS WHAT CULTURE is can be better understood from knowledge of what forms it takes and how it works than by a definition . Culture is in this respect like life or matter : it is the total of their varied phenomena that is more significant than a concentrated phrase about them . And again as with life and with matter , it is true that when we are dealing with the actual manifestations we are less often in doubt as to whether a phenomenon is or is not cultural than we are in deciding on what is includable in the concept of culture when we reason abstractly about it . Nevertheless , it will be worth while to consider some definitions briefly . Tylor says that " culture or civilization is that complex whole which includes knowledge , belief , art , morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ h. h its acquired by man as a member of society . " Linton equates culture with " social heredity . " Lowie calls it " the whole of social tradition . " All three statements Ilse the term " social " or " society , " but in an attributive or qualifying sense . We ran accept this : society and culture , social and cultural , are closely related concepts . There can obviously be no culture without a society  --  much as there can he no society without individuals . The converse  --  no society without culture  --  holds for man : no cultureless human society is known ; it would even be hard to imagine . But it does not hold on the subhuman level . As we have seen ( 6 , 20 ) , ants and bees do have genuine societies without culture , as well as without speech . Less // integrated and simpler associations are frequent among animals . Even a pair of nesting birds rearing their young constitute a society , though a small and temporary one . Accordingly , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a counterpart ; it rests on , and is carried by , society . Beyond the range of man there are societies , but no cultures . Cultural phenomena thus characterize man more specifically than his social manifestations characterize him , for these latter he shares with vertebrate and invertebrate animals . Roughly , then , we can approximate what culture is by saying it is that which the human species has and other social species lack . This would include speech , knowledge , beliefs , customs , arts and technologies , ideals and rules . That , in short , is what we learn from other men , from our elders or the past , plus what we may add to it . That is why Tylor speaks of " capabilities and habits acquired by man , " and what Lowie means when he says " the whole of social tradition , " or Linton by " social heredity . " The last term is unfortunate because heredity now denotes in biology precisely what is received organically or genetically to the exclusion of what is acquired socially or culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more noncommittal near-synonym " inheritance , " the phrase then conveys much the same meaning as Lowie 's " social tradition . " The terms " social inheritance " or " tradition " put the emphasis on how culture is acquired rather than on what it consists of . Yet a naming of all the kinds of things that we receive by tradition  --  speech , knowledges , activities , rules , and the rest  --  runs into quite an enumeration . We have already seen in 2 that things so diverse as hoeing corn , singing the blues , wearing a shirt , speaking English , and being a Baptist are involved . Perhaps a shorter way of designating the content of culture is the negative way of telling what is excluded from it . Put this way around , culture might be defined as all the activities and nonphysiological products of human personalities that are not automatically reflex or instinctive . That in turn means , in biological and psychological parlance , that culture consists of conditioned or learned activities ( plus the manufactured results of these ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is socially transmitted , what is received from tradition , what " is acquired by man as a member of societies . " So perhaps how it comes to be is really more distinctive of culture than what it is . It certainly is more easily expressed specifically . In one sense culture is both superindividual and superorganic . But it is necessary to know what is meant by these terms so as not to misunderstand their implications . " Superorganic " does not mean nonorganic , or free of organic influence and causation ; nor does it mean that culture is an entity independent of organic life in the sense that some theologians might assert that there is a soul which is or can become independent of the living body . " Superorganic " means simply that when we consider culture we are dealing with something that is organic but which must also be viewed as something more than organic if it is to he fully intelligible to us . In the same way when we say that plants and animals are " organic " we do not thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy in general . We only affirm that fully to understand organic beings and how they behave , we have to recognize certain kinds of phenomena or properties  --  such as the powers of reproduction , assimilation , irritability  --  as added to those which we encounter in inorganic substances . Just so , there are certain properties of culture  --  such as transmissibility , high variability , cumulativeness , value standards , influence on individuals  --  which it is difficult to explain , or to see much significance in , strictly in terms of the organic composition of personalities or individuals . These properties or qualities of culture evidently attach not to the organic individual man as such , but to the actions and the behavior products of societies of men  --  that is , to culture . In short , culture is superorganic and superindividual in that , although carried , participated in , and produced by organic individuals , it is acquired ; and it is acquired by learning . What is learned is the existent culture . The content of this is transmitted between individuals without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or body of culture , the institutions and practices and ideas constituting it , have a persistence and can be conceived as going on their slowly changing way " above " or outside the societies that support them . They are " above " them in that a particular culture , a particular set of institutions , can pass to other societies ; also in that the culture continuously influences or conditions the members of the underlying society or societies  --  indeed , largely determines the content of their lives . Further , particular manifestations of call tures find their primary significance in other cultural manifestations , and can be most fully understood in terms of these manifestations ; whereas they can not be specifically explained from the generic organic endowment of the human personality , even though cultural phenomena must always conform to the frame of this endowment . An illustration may make this superorganic quality more vivid . A religion , say Roman Catholicism or Mohammedanism , is of course a piece of culture , and a typical piece or sample . Obviously Catholicism exists only in so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there are human individuals who have acquired the faith . Once established , however , the Catholic hierarchy , belief. , rituals , habits , and attitudes can also be viewed as going on century after ( en . tury . Popes , bishops , communicants succeed one another ; the church persists . It certainly possesses a continuity and an influence of its own : it affects not only its adherents but the course of history . On a smaller scale , or for shorter periods , the same thing holds for smaller segments of culture  --  institutions , beliefs , or customs down to short-lived trivialities of fashion and etiquette . On a larger and more general scale , the same holds for the totality of human culture , cite it first began to develop . Big or little , then , culture affects human action . It is the accident of what culture happens to be in Occidental countries . toward the middle of the twentieth century which determines that when I get up in the morning I put on a shirt and pants and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can we call this contemporary Western culture the cause of my shirt , // wearing ? In ordinary parlance , we might ; the specific custom can certainly not be derived from anything in human hereditary constitution . Dialectically , the cultural causation might be challenged ; it depends on logical definitions . But everyone will agree at least that the concrete cultural fact of habitual shirtwearing is specifically related to or conditioned by other cultural facts , such as antecedent dress styles , manners , laws , or religion . Again , the English language is a piece of culture . The faculty of speaking and understanding some or any language is organic : it is a faculty of the human species . The sounds of words are of course made by individual men and women , and are understood and reacted to by individuals , not by the species . But the total aggregation of words , forms , grammar , and meanings which constitute the English language are the cumulative and joint product of millions of individuals for many centuries past . No one of us creates or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as it comes to him , ready-made , from his millions of predecessors and from his elders and age mates . English is obviously superindividual in the sense that it is something enormously bigger and more significant than the speech of any individual man , and in that it influences his speaking infinitely more than his speaking can hope to contribute to or influence the English language . And English is superorganic in that its words and meanings are not direct outflows or consequences of men 's being human organisms  --  else all men would spontaneously talk as much alike as they walk alike . Instead , how they talk depends overwhelmingly on how the societies in which they were raised talked before . A piece of culture such as the English language is therefore a historical phenomenon . This means that its specific features can not be adequately explained by the organic features of our species  --  nor of a race  --  but are most intelligible in the light of the long , complex , and locally varied history of the institution we call English speech . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its most immediate understanding , and usually the fullest understanding of it to which we can attain , is a historical one . To a large degree calling culture superorganic or superindividual means that it yields more readily to historical interpretation than to organic or psychosomatic explanations . A simile that may further help the realization of what culture is and how it works is that of a coral reef . Such a reef may be miles long and inhabited by billions of tiny polyp animals . The firm , solid part of the reef consists of calcium carbonate produced by the secretions of these animals over thousands of years  - -  a product at once cumulative and communal and therefore social . What is alive and organic in the reef is these innumerable little animals on its ocean-fronting surface . Without their ancestors , there would have been no reef . But the reef now exists independently of the living polyps , and would long continue to endure even if every polyp were killed by , say , a change in ocean temperature or salinity . It would still break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bar off quiet water behind . While a coral reef is the accumulated pre258 THE // introduced from outside and fitted into it , after which the people of the culture were no longer much concerned about the fact of introduction . Probably the greater part of every culture has percolated into it . We do not think of our American civilization as something that is particularly discordant or ill-assembled . Yet we speak an Anglo-Saxon form of a Germanic language that contains more original Latin than English words . Our religion is Palestinian , with its specific formulations into denominations made chiefly in Rome , Germany , England , Scotland , and Holland . Our Bible is translated partly from Hebrew , partly from Greek . We drink coffee first grown in Ethiopia and adopted in Arabia , tea discovered in China , beer first brewed in ancient Mesopotamia or Egypt , hard liquor invented in mediaeval Europe . Our bread , beef , and other meats are from plants and animals first domesticated in Asia ; our potatoes , corn , tomatoes , and beans were first used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Etruscan-Roman variant of a Greek form of an alphabet invented in or near Phoenicia by a Semitic people on the basis of nonalphabetic writing in still more ancient cultures ; its first printing took place in Germany , on paper devised in China . It is needless to extend the catalogue . We no longer feel these things of foreign origin as being foreign ; they have become an integral part of our culture . It is only when we pause for scientific analysis , for historical retrospect , that we become aware of their alien or remote source . They are a part of our culture , and are used as such . This is not because modern American civilization is particularly polyglot , but because so far as we can tell such a condition is typical of all cultures . If ancient Egypt , Sumer , India , or China seems less flooded with import and more original , it is only because historical record fails , and we get no more than ctc casional indications of the alien and still more ancient sources of their culture content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistances , strains , and dislocations when particular culture import takes place . They may or may not occur ; they frequently do . We shall consider some of these resistances later ( 172 , 176 ) . But in spite of them , in the long pull , absorptions and assimilations continue to tills e place . How far such assimilation is also an integration , or how far it may be simply a collocation of things that are treated as if they were functionally fitted together even though they are not  --  this is a complicating problem whose consideration we must also defer . But it is a fair question : Why is cultural receptivity so high , and the amount of diffusion and absorption so great ? There are several reasons . A steel knife or ax just is physically more dire Live than a stone one ; a motortruck more so than a freight wagon . I n other words , in the sphere of practical , mechanical things , there are objective supers. orities , and the invention of a superior artifact in one culture anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures as soon as they learn about it . Then , whatever comes from a society that is stronger , wealthier , cleverer , or has greater prestige comes with a favorable recommendation . Missionizationi // may accentuate this process ; and there often is conscious missionization for products and brands , for political and social ideas , as well as for religions . Finally , man is an animal who has a great faculty for getting bored , and many things are taken up just because they are new and different . Some of these will be dropped again for the same reason ; but others will stick . There probably are still other factors at work ; but those mentioned may suffice to make it reasonable that there should be so much cultural receptivity , diffusion , assimilation , and compositeness . II4 . ORGANIC DIVERSITY , CULTURAL HYBRIDITY It is a striking fact that on the organic level there is nothing parallel to this cultural assimilativeness . Animals and plants absorb and assimilate their food  - -  note the identity of the words , but with the metaphorical , connotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . It is no longer grass or seed or flesh ; it has become muscle or blood or bone in a new organism . But Christianity and the Roman alphabet are still Christianity and the alphabet after our culture , or that of our ancestors or successors , has taken them in , has " absorbed " them . The counterpart of course is that no part of Christianity is destroyed or made over into something radically different on being taken into a new culture , as food is in the body . There simply is more Christianity in the world than ihere was before , instead of less . This is one way in which culture may be said to work cumulatively , in comparison with organisms . Another comparison , or rather contrast , with the organic may be made . A cow and a bison can , with some difficulty , be crossed or hybridized , so that an intermediate form results . This is because they are both of the family Bovidae ; that is , sprung from common ancestors from whom they have not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hybridize , but the offspring is sterile . It seems impossible to produce a self-perpetuating species of mules . If the divergence is a little greater , there will not even be offspring . Cows and horses simply can not be amalgamated . In other words , the organic process , while it allows enormous persistences , is also , so far as its general or longer course is concerned , both diversifying and irretraceable . Once the genetic diversification or " evolution " has gone beyond a certain quite narrow degree , there is no more possibility of reversal and assimilation . By contrast , cultures can blend to almost any degree and not only thrive but perpetuate themselves . Classic Greek civilization was a mixture of primitive Greek , Minoan , Egyptian , and Asiatic elements . Of the Asiatic elements , the alphabet , the zodiac , and the system of weights ( 191 , 208 , 229 ) are only a few examples . Japanese civilization is partly autochthonous , whence its goddescended Emperor and Shinto ritual ; partly Chinese , such as its writing and philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories , export trade , telephones , and movies . It is needless to pile up examples : as has already // Let us run down an example . It needs no proof that total human culture shows a number of well-marked varieties , such as contemporary Western or Occidental or Eur-American civilization ; the East Asiatic , the Indian , and the Islamic civilizations ; and a number of cultures that are possessed by smaller societies and are often labeled " primitive " or " savage . " Within each of these , subvarieties are recognizable without difficulty , such as Chinese and Japanese within East Asiatic . From the point of view of the outsider , Japanese culture is still very similar to Chinese culture , because so much of it has been derived from the Chinese or through the Chinese . Yet recent Japanese culture contained a native cult religion , Shinto , that was without counterpart in China ; but Japan lacked any Taoist establishment . It provided for a ruler who was also a god  - -  an institution lacking in Chinese culture ; but it never accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long characterized the latter . And so on . Deviations of a roughly similar degree separate the main areas or nations within Occidental civilization : Italian from German , German from French , French from British , American from British , in ways that are familiar . Somewhat lesser are the differentiations we generally call regional : as of Bavaria within Germany , the Midi in France , Scotland in Great Britain . To the foreigner , these regional peculiarities may be a bit elusive , but a native is likely to be oriented about them . He will know roughly how New England and the South or the Middle West diverge in denominational and party affiliation , in degree of industrialization or agrarianism , in manners , temperament , and dialect . A step lower , and we come to what is usually called provincial distinc tiveness , as of Normandy from Brittany . To this there might correspond the differentiation between North and South Carolina . Beyond this , there is the cantonal or local  --  Swiss Geneva being Calvinist , watchmaking , and international-minded ; but Swiss Schwyz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level that until recently peasant costumes and folk dances varied from valley to valley , or even from village to village , in much of Europe . At present in Europe , and almost from the first in historically shallow-rooted America and Australia , differences of the scope of these cantonal cultures are more likely to be expressed between economic classes or professions than locally ; as between , say , doctors , barbers , printers , railroad men , and ministers , rather than between counties . There is no doubt that , quite apart from their vocational skills , the average culture of these professional groups differs slightly in dress , mantic , standards , tastes , knowledge , habits , and amusements . We might call them pro fessional subcultures or sub-subcultures . This example shows how the same term is actually applied to the important cultures of great societies spread over large areas and to their more transient local or divisional phases . There even seems to be a degree of good reason for applying the same term . Occidental civilization no doubt represents something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . men . But it can not possibly be defined as rigorously as the latter , because it // is itself only a composite , a common denominator , of innumerable such phases , which have the greater definiteness . That is to say , it is the subcultures of clerical , : sporting , transportational , and other such groups , and the Southern , New England , Midwest , Pacific-coast variants of these , which possess the sharper characterization , as against which total " American " culture is a slightly blurred composite or average . On the other hand , these local and divisional phases die out , merge , or get absorbed , like the cantonal cultures characterized by costume and dance . They are being obliterated by the spread of communications , by the rise of syndicated newspapers , by radio and films , and by ready-made-clothing factories . While the larger cultures are therefore less easily definable in terms of precise combinations of the traits characterizing them , they tend to be more durable in their main aggregations . There is thus a continuous transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corresponding variation from more permanence to more precision ; but all of them are significant . Similarly , where sessile primitive populations live in small groups , it has been found that their local cultures vary almost exactly in proportion to distance . Thus the Pomo Indians of California lived in independent groups or tribelets of perhaps two hundred , each owning a tract of land and a main settlement . These settlements averaged possibly ten miles apart . A careful estimate , based on count of culture traits found present and absent , has shown that adjacent communities shared about 95 per cent of their culture , and that each was likely to have evolved perhaps 1 per cent of innovations or specific originalities . The other 4 per cent of their cultures consisted of a border zone of traits known to both communities but used by one only , or practiced by one for the other . In this cultural transition there might fall a ritual performed only by tribelet A but attended by B ; a fishing harpoon known to all communities in the area and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in A 's territory were too small for fish of harpoonable size ; and so on . Tribelet C  --  say twenty miles from A , beyond B  --  would differ from A more than B differed from A , but by the same ratio ; D still more ; and so on ; the process continuing in all directions until perhaps a mountain range or an uninhabited tract , a radical change of speech , or some not too ancient movement of people or other accident of history , produced a slightly greater jump in the continuity . Where the situation of the tribelets or communities was linear , as along the coast from California to Alaska , the gradualness of the change is particularly striking , and renders it quite difficult to decide , except on the basis of speech , where one culture type ended and another began . Surprisingly , it seems to have made little difference whether adjacent communities were prevailingly friendly or hostile . All this seems very much like the locally variant forms of culture in Europe , especially rural Europe , of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show that a well-known historical phenomenon , the continuity of history , parallels in time this continuity of culture in space . // The general effect of these nineteenth-century recognitions of course was in favor of tolerance and in diminution of ethnocentrism  --  that tendency to assume the universe as pivoted around one 's particular people and to see one 's in-group as always right and all out-groups as wrong wherever they differ . The realization that every culture is more or less right in its ways when judged in terms of its own premises , and that no culture is provably more right than others in the abstract , was achieved by a much wider circle of minds than the scattering anthropologists of the later nineteenth century . But anthropologists , being in most continuous contact with a wide series of highly divergent cultures , were perhaps most consistently impressed , and they came to take the principle for granted as underlying their work . The most eloquent exposition in English of the point of view is Sumner 's Folkways of T906 . A somewhat heterodox sociologist and economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exemplified vividly and abundantly . To him , folkways are ways of the folk , of the unsophisticated , unanalytic mass of mankind . They are , in short , customs , held to with much momentum but with incomplete rationality ; and crossing them may cause a flare-up of fear or anger . They grow unconsciously ; they are not creations of purpose ; but they are basic societal forces . Mores , ' Latin for customs and the origin of our word " morals , " is a somewhat more special concept that Sumner helped to establish in nontechnical English usage . Mores are folkways which include a belief that they are desirable for social welfare and which people insist that their fellows conform to , though the mores are not derived from politically constituted authority . They are not laws , though they may produce laws , just as they result in taboos . " Folkways whose ethical sanctions have risen into consciousness " might be a fair definition of mores . Similar ideas as to the nonrational and unconscious elements in culture were widely diffused throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marx , for instance , was certainly convinced that he knew the right understanding of past history as well as the solution of the problems of the future . Yet his economic determinism is tempered by considerable realization ( it the unconsciousness of social forces . He holds that it is not consciousness ( it purpose but methods of material production which determine the social , polio cal , and spiritual processes of life  --  in other words , the noneconomic culture ; and then , in turn , this socio-politico-spiritual culture " determines " or produces consciousness or recognition of itself . Psychology has arrived at much the same basic concepts , largely by a route of its own  --  a route of reaction in some ways . Formally , psychology began as . t branch of philosophy after this had become preoccupied with the problem td how we know things and what knowledge is valid . The early psychology watt introspective , self-conscious , and rational . As it drifted , in the later nineteenth // century , from philosophical and deductive affiliations into inductive and exploratory aims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test ; on the other , into the fields of the nonrational , the emotions and the subconscious , where direct introspection pretty much breaks down . Psychoanalysis is one special manifestation of this general psychological trend . The realm of the nonrational is also the realm of custom and morals , analytically viewed ; and cultural , social , and psychological thinking have more and more approached and reinforced one another . The element of relativity , of a new culture making a new environment for the individual , came into psychology latest , because there was nothing in the antecedents of psychology to suggest that differences of culture had much significance . Introspection in its nature emphasizes the ego and underemphasizes environment , social or other . Also , the philosophy in which psychology had its root was so completely concerned with universals and constants that it gave little notice to relativities and differences . Recent decades however have seen a thorough swing-over of psychology ; and while as a science directed at the individual it must operate quite differently from anthropology , whose central concern is the superindividual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same basic assumptions as to the relations of individual and culture . They may therefore be said to be attacking the same set of problems each from its own side  --  each in its own proper way , but with cooperative understanding . I17 . CULTURE AND SOCIETY Cultures are products of human societies operating under the influence of cultures handed down to them from earlier societies . This description illustrates the close relation of culture and society : they are counterparts , like the two faces of a sheet of paper . To each distinctive culture there corresponds , necessarily and automatically , a particular society : to Hottentot culture , the Hottentot nation . ality , to Chinese civilization , the Chinese people . It is rather futile to discuss which of the two phases or aspects is primary . It is obvious that if there were no people and therefore no societies , there could be no cultures . But equally , if there were no cultures , humanity would be merely another species of brute animals . We should in fact in that event probably not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bees , and termites , because of lack of the highly specific instinctual faculties of these animals , and of their altruistic devotion to the hive . Occasionally someone or other still attempts to assert that culture is secondary to society and therefore relatively negligible ; or that within culture the domain of social relations is primary over the fields of economics , technology , knowledge , and belief . We have already seen ( 6 ) that the first of these opinions is arbitrary . The second is equally so . It is true that social structure of some sort can not he dispensed with in any culture . But neither can a sub270 THE // lower . Individuals are put into the subclass to which the community assigns them : mostly , anyone in the community that knows a given individual agrees pretty well with everyone else as to his place in the scale . In an old but smallish New England town thinly disguised as " Yankee City , " the percentage strength of the six classes from Upper Upper to Lower Lower is : 1.5 , 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i per cent unknown . In this New England community the classes are also very well characterized culturally , by what clubs or organizations their members belong to , denominational affiliation , type of magazines read , and so forth ; and social mobility  --  social climbing  --  is low and slow . It remains to be seen how far this scheme is of general utility , even in other American situations . It is of course possible to slice any population into three or six levels ; the question is : How far will these levels represent natural segregations , distinctions , existing de facto in the society and culture ? It seems doubtful how far the seven million people of New York City could be easily allocated to the same six levels ; or for that matter the members of a prosperous rural community in Iowa ; and if it turned out that they could somehow be allocated , it is certain that the cultural criterion of each class would be very different . For instance , " Cottonville " in the Deep South proved no longer to contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely under the influence of the ideals and standards of that class . This recognition of a class existing outside the community would indicate that Cottonville was not a society complete in itself ; that its culture is only part of a larger culture ( 119 ) . At the other end of the scale , its " poor whites " are set off as an essentially unitary Lower class ; and everything in between them and the nonpresent aristocracy , from Lower Upper to Lower Middle , also seems remarkably homogeneous . All this is for Caucasians in Cottonville : the Negroes form a separate " caste "  --  really therefore a separate though interlocked society  --  with its own social classes . Of these the Upper , containing 5 per cent of the Negroes , is determined by sex morality , education , and professional occupation rather than by income . " Plainville , " as described by ' West , is an agricultural Missouri community with a small-town center . Just about half the population tends to describe itself as " good , self-respecting , average people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , " " all right , " or occasionally even as " upper class . " This half would semi to correspond objectively more or less to Warner 's Middle Class , probably Loss rr Middle . A few families among them are somewhat more prosperous and influential than the rest , and are occasionally referred to as " upper crust , " " rich , " or " think they 're better . " However , they do not differ in manners or iii pro . fessed social claims , and West refrains from designating them as a distinct group . The whole upper half of Plainville lives overwhelmingly on prairie land , the lower half , on hill land . Of this lower half , somewhat more than the majority  --  say around 30 per cent of the total population  --  is described by the upper half as " good lower class . " The remaining 20 per cent or so segregate in a ratio of about two to one respectively into " the lower clement " and " people // who live like animals "  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apparently often subnormal in intelligence . Both the groups above these two lowest groups are in full agreement as to which families are to be assigned there . The two lowest subgroups together would correspond roughly to Warner 's Lower Lower ; the 30 per cent above them , to his Upper Lower . Here we have another example of a community without an upper class within itself : if it has a top , that exists elsewhere , in the larger national society . In other words , the community is not self-sufficient , nor is the culture wholly intelligible in terms of community structure as such . This condition is probably true in some degree even of fairly large communities , but is increasingly conspicuous as their size is smaller . Plainville also agrees with our previous American examples in that the bottom stratum is less numerous than those above it . The social classes do not form a broad-based pyramid , as social theorists have often proclaimed or assumed  --  and as may have been true until recently in countries of mediaeval retardation like China , Czarist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagrammatic representation of social stratification in the United States is evidently by the figure of a lozenge or diamond stood on end , as West employs it for Plainville . Religion was still socially significant in Plainville as of 1941 . Nonchurch people easily outnumbered any one sect , but the five denominations together had perhaps twice as many adherents as there were nonchurch people . These denominations would probably have been somewhat different in the next town , but in Plainville they happened to be , in order of their strength : Baptist , next Holiness , then Christian and Methodist about even , and Dunkard last . The distribution in terms of social rank is however quite uneven . Membership in the Holiness Church is a full 95 per cent Lower Class . Dunkards are about half and half , and Baptist somewhat more Middle . Neither of these sects includes persons from the very apex of the local social structure ; but Christians and Methodists do . Both these denominations , and especially the Christian , also penetrate only very slightly into the lower half of the society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up and down the Plainville social scale . It includes nearly half of the Middle Class apex , but a decreasing proportion as one descends the Middle ranks . Then it increases again toward the Middle border line and throughout the Lower half , finally taking in most of the lower element " and nearly all of the " live-like-animals " segment . It is evident that the church denominations serve as symbols and instruments of social hierarchy , but that the distribution of the nonchurch population is due to other and less obvious factors . In " Small Town , " of less than i000 souls in eastern New York , Hicks found only two classes , the upper one nearly twice as large as the lower . There is considerable difficulty in defining criteria of distinction between the classes , but no difficulty in assigning any resident to his class . Public opinion seems spontane // ously unanimous on that . In fact , the largest factor in determining class affiliation in Small Town seems to be subjective admission of belonging . Some accept lower-class affiliation with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of relief at being able to let themselves go instead of having to live up to responsibilities and standards . Obviously there is no one class pattern that can be applied everywhere . Conversely , some class segregation can be expected in practically all societies except the smallest and poorest in culture . The most important effect of the Yankee City school of social anthropology is probably to prove to us that we Americans too are socially stratified in spite of wanting to believe that we are not . If the stratification proves to be locally variable , that only makes it so much the more interesting . The trick of professing one thing and doing another is no doubt common to all societies . They vary chiefly in what they are inconsistent about . The habit of rationalization has been discussed ( 81 ) and will be referred to again ( 216 ) . One need not feel too harsh about it . Professions after all mean standards and ideals ; and it may be better for societies to have standards and fall short of them than not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to recognize whatever discrepancy there is , instead of covering up to produce a sensitive blind spot . I18 . INFLUENCE OF SIZE OF SOCIETY It has long been recognized that the size of a society can be expected to exert certain effects on its culture . This influence appears to be most marked in the periods when higher civilizations first take shape . While reasoning on this matter is somewhat a priori , the drift of history and archaeology confirms it . Assume a given population in a given area , but divided into a hundred tribes , each owning a territory yielding it subsistence , each independent , each jealous and suspicious of its neighbors . With a million people in the area , the tribes would average 10,000 souls . There might be a council or a chief or a kinglet to govern each of these tribes . There might be in each tribe some sort of a central settlement or market or town , but nothing like a real city , nor ; Inv serious accumulation of wealth . Most of the tribal members would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wholly rural sections until quite lately , every man would be something of a jack-of-all-trades , able to farm , clear , build , fell , repair , or fight ; his women would know how to cool : , spin , weave , sew , milk , and thresh , or the equivalents of these in the local form of culture . There would be little need for writing or records , hence limited learn ing . Arts would most likely be home crafts . The priest and the doctor might function as such mainly in their spare time after making a living ; a smith or two perhaps would work full time and professionally  --  if iron and tools were abundant enough to keep him busy . In short , the smallness of the social group // would tend to keep it undifferentiated in its activities , and therefore culturally undeveloped . Now let our hundred little tribes be united into one society acknowledging its unity  --  whether by voluntary conglomeration or by the conquests of one leader . The hundred councils or chiefs are replaced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a city ; its house , the largest in the country , would now be a palace of sorts ; its shrine , a national temple . To tend the shrine there might follow full-time priests , who would leave their offices to their descendants or to trained successors . Revenues and trade would flow into the capital ; craftsmen could now expect steady custom and could become skilled . The ruler 's resources and inclination toward show might lead to patronage which in turn would encourage the arts ; the lifelong priests might pile up observations leading to the devising of a regulated calendar . All in all , the mere size of the society , now a hundredfold greater and with its parts in closer intercommunication than before  --  at least toward its center  --  would trend toward professional differentiation , accumulation of skills , new inventions , and an upsurge of cultural content . To a greater or less degree this is what appears actually to have happened in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia , China and Japan , Mexico and Peru , and again , with intensification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by or before 3000 B.C. in Egypt and Mesopotamia ( 286 ) ; perhaps a thousand years later in China ( 299 ) ; during the Christian era in the other countries . In each case there was more political unity than there had previously been , rulers of greater authority and sometimes with attribution of divinity , the beginnings of cities , development of metallurgical and other arts , and usually the formulation or the introduction of systems of writing and calendars . Any one of these advances tended to bring advancement in others . For instance , city life meant that there were classes no longer working the soil themselves : rulers , or craftsmen , or merchants , or priests . Wealth could accumulate ; and temples or palaces called for new architectural endeavors . Similarly , writing opened a variety of new avenues : bookkeeping for taxes , history on behalf of the reigning dynasty , more exactly transmitted rituals , records for the calendar-framers . The entire complex process of forward movement may have been actually initiated by any one of its interwoven components , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing , the divinity ascribed to rulers , or by some other factor . But the distinctive accompaniment in any one of these cases was the political unification . That meant there was a much larger society , which could now diversify into a variety of classes and professions instead of being broken up quantitatively into a series of nearly uniform tribal units . And of course a society diversified qualitatively means a richer culture instead of a repetitively narrow one . This summary of what actually happened in the protohistoric period in , ; evcral parts of the world should not be construed as a universal " must . " The // successful development of Greek culture in a period of autonomous tiny citystates is enough to show that . Emphatically , the richness of civilizations can not be measured in the abstract by the size of their societies . All that can be maintained is that , other things being equal , an integrated society large enough to be socially diversified has a better chance to produce a richly diversified culture than an equally large population broken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems especially true at a certain level or stage ; namely , after agriculture has made concentration of numbers possible , and when tribal , oral , folk culture is about to begin to convert into urban and literate culture . The Greek states remained minute in the period of their cultural efflorescence ; but they were urban , and they had recently become literate . Also , it is possible for a society to attain new peaks in its culture while many of its members are worse off than before through not sharing in the new attainments . This is a price that tends to be paid for the gains of specialization ; and it can become fatal . This counterpart is discussed below under Participation in 124 . II9 . SUBCULTURES AND PART-CULTURES We have seen how each class in a society exhibits a more or less distinct phase , a subculture , of the total culture carried by the society ; just as geographical segments of the society manifest regional aspects of the culture . This principle extends farther : to age levels and the sexes . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their culture , and vice versa . And though both sexes are generically oriented about these habits  --  they always know that certain peculiarly feminine ( or masculine ) activities exist  --  they may be so hazily informed about them that they could not adequately practice them or transmit them in their entirety if they would . At the same time these sex phases are never felt as constituting more than a side or an aspect of the culture  --  nor , indeed , do they constitute more . A unisexual society could no more exist among human beings than could a unisexual race ; and neither are there unisexual cultures . The feminine component is always a complement of the masculine : the culture is not felt as complete , and is not complete , without both components . The same things holds , incidentally , for the class phases , and often for the regional phases , of wellintegrated cultures . Scavengers and bankers will be recognized in such cultures as quite properly following diverse strains of life and making diverse contributions , but their coherence within the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separateness . They are both organs within the same body , like the patricians and the plebeians in the old Roman fable about the stomach and the limbs . The cultural differences between age levels within a society follow a somewhat different pattern . The ages are inevitably continuous and overlapping , as sexes and many classes are not . Culture phases associated with age may be // assumed to correspond to changes taking place in the culture , rather than to ; effect chronic or static lines of segregation like those between social classes . Individuals above fifty will largely be trying to practice and maintain their established habits and status , and therewith a phase of culture some of which is just beginning to pass ; those under thirty will be interested in the phase that is trying to arrive . It is now well recognized that in contemporary civilization adolescents in the larger sense  --  the individuals between dependent childhood and full maturity with social responsibility  --  learn more about many things from age mates or near-age mates than from their elders . At any rate , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are more conditioned socially by them . As for the effect of this fact on culture , that is an intriguing and little-explored problem . However , it seems that the constant change which is normal in every culture is chiefly initiated not by its adolescents , but by its mature individuals , especially by the younger half of these mature individuals . What then do adolescents teach each other ? It appears to be little in the way of substantial cultural content . This substantial content , if well established in the culture , would come of itself from the parental generation ; if new , from the younger or more progressive section of the adult population as a whole . What adolescents impart to one another seems chiefly to be accepted cultural content stylistically modified as to its manner or form . This means fashions , mannerisms , ways of speaking , sitting , dancing , or reacting , and the like : special brands of slang , for instance , or of slouches and other postures ; modifications of existing traits , in short , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes in for certain choices among existing types of clothes , such as low flat shoes and sweaters for coeds , or even only a certain way of pushing the sleeves back ; they do not ordinarily invent a new garment . This example seems typical of adolescent culture . Its quality is a special twist given to the standard culture ; a conscious departure from some elements of it , or a sort of deliberately distorted reflection . Ordinarily there is no real revolt , no seeking a reform , but a basic conformity with the existing order , accentuated by an assertion of age-class independence at points of no great moment . By the time full social maturity is entered , most of the twists are abandoned by each individual . The whole phenomenon may be compared to the slight wave or bulge of water that the bow of a moving ship keeps pushing just ahead of it . It must also be remembered that this kind of adolescent-culture phase is specially characteristic of modern city life and the leisure of prolonged education . In cultures or classes where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge seems to be toward acquisition of adult status and privilege in normal form . It also seems possible that in our contemporary society the urge of each adolescent generation to set itself off as an age class is an unconscious compensation for the relative lack of sharp demarcation of overt social levels . // A particular kind of class is caste . Castes are closed classes . Individual mobility from one into another class is forbidden by the larger society . Naturally , each caste reflects one particular facet of a larger culture . This is true even where , as in most of the United States , the basic doctrine of democratic equality sets limits to the functioning of caste . American Negro culture may aim at being an integration into white culture or a repetition of it , but actually it is a variant and not a duplication . In a country like India , differentiations are so intensive , and so firmly entrenched , that the more extreme castes might almost be accredited as following distinct cultures , so much do they differ  --  not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal laws , education , amusements , worship , and standards . Essentially it is the less extreme intervening castes , plus intercaste community of regional speech , which succeed in holding the top and bottom levels within the frame of one society and one culture in India . India is almost perversely unique in the degree to which it is caste-ridden , and the American color situation carries a high-voltage charge of emotion , so it may be well to examine a case that does not involve either race or a wholesale caste system . Through much of North Africa and Arabia smiths form an in-marrying profession . They may be respected , despised , or feared , but are set apart . Among the camel-breeding Beduin of northern Arabia , such as the Ruwala , smiths and the Negro slaves form the only separate castes not marrying with the main population . The smiths alone know how to shoe horses , repair guns , and the like , and get paid for their work , with which income they purchase their food and living , instead of raising camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninvolved in the touchy honor system , vendettas , and raids of their tribes . If by oversight a smith is pillaged , the smiths in the raiding group arrange for his property to be returned to him . On the other hand , though they do not fight , smiths receive what may be described as a small fixed percentage of the spoils taken in battle . It is evident that the social and prestige system as well as the occupational and economic activities of the smiths is wholly distinct from those of the main body of the Ruwala Beduin . Yet the two form parts of one society . The Ruwala would be paralyzed without their smiths , and the latter of course could not exist at all without the Ruwala . I20 . NOMADIC , CASTE , AND PARASITIC CULTURES Much the same sort of relation holds , on a larger scale , between the Beduin and the neighboring settled Arabs . The livelihood of the nomads is in their camels , whose milk is their main food , whose herds are their wealth and their only salable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes of the steppe and the desert go dry , it is with their camels that they buy , in the settled country , all their clothing and black tents , their carpets , their weapons and iron pans , barley to feed their prized brood mares , and virtually all their own non milk food  --  wheat , rice , dates , and coffee . The very poor may have to do without // this bought food ; but the reasonably prosperous consume close to a pound of it a day per capita . Meat is too valuable to eat , ordinarily ; a butchered camel is so much capital eaten up . It is clear that without what they secure from the towns and traders of the farming country , the Beduin would have so one-sided a culture that they could not survive by it : no clothing , shelter , weapons , few utensils , limited diet . In one sense , accordingly , their own culture is no more than a halfculture . At least they can produce only half of it , and are dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the other half . Yet the Beduin are not a mere occupational subgroup , nor a caste like the smiths . They are a full-fledged society , or series of tribal societies , independent , autonomous , each owning territory , waging war . To some extent , this condition of possessing a " half-culture " holds for most nomads . Their range is from Arabia westward across Africa through and south of the Sahara ; and eastward through Iran , Soviet Turkestan , Chinese Turkestan and Tibet , North China and Mongolia , to Manchuria  --  the great transcontinental arid belt of Africa-Asia . With insignificant exceptions it is only in this belt that true pastoral nomads occur : peoples making their living wholly off their flocks without settling down to plant . Alongside them , however , in rainier tracts and oases or on irrigated land within the belt , there normally are farmers , and often towns or cities . These agricultural populations are frequently the more numerous , though the herders loom large on the map because they need and have more of the low-grade land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the Masai and Bahima and Banyankole in East Africa , and the Fulah in West Africa . Elsewhere , the settled people are more often on top , though it may be difficult , or not very worth while , for them to control the roamers in the steppe . Jenghis Khan was a pastoral nomad Mongol when he and his sons and grandsons in the 12oo 's conquered out from Central Asia as far as to include Russia and China . But by i600 Mongolia was again dominated by China . Nomads in general feel free , are proud , and look down on the sedentary groups , though they are fewer , poorer , and envious of the latters ' luxury and wealth . The roaming life in the desert largely colored early Arabic poetry ; but Mohammed , who launched the Arabs and their culture to greatness , was a townsman and a trader . Lattimore has even advanced a theory that East Asiatic nomadism developed secondarily out of the mixed farming and stockbreeding of China when increase of population began to push this mixed method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into submarginal desert . After a certain point was reached , it proved more profitable to renounce planting altogether in favor of wide herd range and human mobility . This is suggested as having begun to happen on the North China frontier only shortly before the Christian era ; whereupon the power of the Hiung-Nu arose as the first of a succession of transient pastoral-nomadic states of which the Mongol finally became the greatest . This interpretation still remains hypothetical ; but it is interesting because it does recognize pure pastoralism as a specialty sec // ondarily segregated out of a more balanced economy by accentuation of one part . In passing , it may be mentioned that the view of a succession of stages of human-culture evolution from hunting to herding to farming is now considered a completely antiquated theory . It was a pseudo-philosophical guess aiming to supersede actual history , and there are masses of scholarly and scientific evidence to the contrary . In fact , the theory has been traced back in its germs to speculations made by the Sumerians of lower Mesopotamia five thousand years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggeration to say that all pastoral nomad cultures would perish if they tried to become wholly self-sufficient in isolation , yet it is clear that they are particularly one-sided and limited , and tend to stand in a relation of complement to the richer and more varied cultures of adjacent or interspersed sedentary societies . This is what is meant here by calling them half-cultures or part-cultures . They would not have been able to specialize to the same degree if they were wholly isolated and independent . They exist in some degree of cultural and social symbiosis . Our cowboy world of Western fiction and films is much the same sort of thing on a fantasy level . On that level , attention is directed toward romance , and away from the fact that this appealing world of the Bar-X ranch would collapse , or at least squalidly deteriorate , if it were really cut off from the rest of the United States . Riding range in actual life is just one occupation of many in our economy , and in everything else the cowpuncher is a participant in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pastoral belt of Africa-Asia , the cowpuncher would often be set apart from the nonpastoral population in race or speech or religion also , and perhaps he would be politically independent . But his complementary integration with the nonnomadic culture would remain fairly similar to the cowpuncher 's with ours . It is in his social consciousness that the nomad is free , separate , and proud . His specific culture may be almost as largely a part of a greater culture as the facet cultures of classes or castes elsewhere are only such parts . There are several other populations , ranging from castes to small races , to whom something like half-cultures might be attributed  --  and disputed . There are the Jews , whose culture differs from that of coterritorial Gentiles primarily in religion and ritual practices . When this religion loses its hold , Jews come to approximate Gentiles very closely , and generally tend to merge socially , or at least are willing to lose their group identity . Where the culture of Jews is distinctive in nonreligious matters , as in their occupations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through being shut out from other callings ; or through having been shut out legally from them until so recently that enforced habits still persist . The degree to which Jews are separate in their bodily heredity has been discussed in 68 . It can be at best only a quite minor factor in their culture determination . Their speech too is usually that of the country its which they live . If it differs , it is through recency of immigration , as in Nrw // York . Or it is because of enforced migration , as of the Spanish-speaking Jews of Salonika , or the corrupt German called Yiddish which the Jews of much of eastern Europe spoke because they were driven there from Germany . Compulsory ghetto segregation , as in Czarist Russia , has kept dialects like Yiddish alive through the centuries . Biblical Hebrew was a dead language to about the same degree as Latin until it was resuscitated as a living national speech by some hundreds of thousands of Zionists in Palestine ; but whether with historical success , only the future can tell ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews seem to constitute a social quasi-caste based originally and mainly on a religion that of course is voluntary , not enforced . Their social segregation is markedly stronger than their cultural distinctness , though the latter is not absolutely lacking . The Gypsy situation is a little different . Fundamentally , the Gypsies are an endogamous caste . They originated in India ; and they show definite evidence of that fact in their blood type ( 72 ) and in the Romany speech of which they retain remnants in addition to the language of whatever country they inhabit . In religion they are more or less professing Christians ; and they specialize in certain occupations like horse-trading and tinkering . But what sets them off from the rest of the population is not so much positive cultural peculiarities as the inclination toward an unrooted and vagrant life . Their distinctness lies above all in an attitude , or orientation , which leads them to select a certain group of activities in Western civilization and to discard most of the others . They want a horse or an automobile , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank account ; music , but no education ; and so on . In many of their attitudes they are like hobos : both elect to follow one particular vein of the many that make up our culture  --  the vein or line of freedom , irresponsibility , and instability . But of course hobos have no separateness of race or speech , nor are they strictly a caste , because without women and families they lack hereditary continuity and are merely an association group constantly rerecruited by adversity or temperament . Gypsies evince definite cultural distinctness ; only , as they neither constitute a full society nor possess a complete culture , they serve as another example of half-cultures . They certainly have an ethos ( 125 ) all their own . At the extreme edge of this concept , we have peoples like the Seri Indians or the Negritos , whose attitudes are in part like those of Gypsies . Here we have indubitably distinct and autonomous social groups , each with its specific culture . The Negritos are even markedly distinct in their miniature racial type ( 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The mode of life of both peoples is unsettled , and , in line with that propensity , the culture of both may be described as kept simple . It contains nothing specific that is not known in the surrounding richer cultures . The specializations consist of makeshifts like the 28o THE NATURE OF CULTURE 120 single shaft that the Seri use interchangeably as harpoon , mast , or raft-poler ; or like the Negrito bow , which the non-Negrito Filipinos have discarded as useless to them . Historically at any rate , cultures such as these are parasitic . They have contributed little or nothing , so far as we can judge , to the stock of human culture , while they have taken from other cultures what they do possess , and that with heavy reduction . The Seri , so far back as we know them , have also been outrightly parasitic on other groups , so far as they could , by force , cajolery , or sufferance , much like Gypsies . On the contrary , the Negritos are sturdily independent ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical dependence or parasitism of one culture on another is by no means the same thing as the social parasitism of one group on another . Nevertheless , if all nonGypsies were suddenly blotted out of Europe and North America and those continents left wholly to the Gypsies , it is reasonable to believe that the culture of the Gypsies in a few generations would fairly resemble that of Seris or Negritos in orientation , and perhaps ultimately in simplicity of substance or content also . This matter of partial cultures or half-cultures needs more defining and exploring . It is evident that the relations between the larger or " enclosing " cultures and the special smaller ones vary a great deal  --  as much so as the relations between " whole " societies and their castes or classes or regional segments . Unconsciously we tend to think in terms of large ethnic units , such as the French , whose geographic boundaries are within a single color block on the map , and whose society , nation , language , and culture pretty well coincide . Actually of course France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bretons , Walloons , Basques , hobos , and apache criminals , each of which groups has its variant form of French civilization , just as French officials and French dirt farmers have . And of course French civilization itself is only one phase or form of Western culture . Also we tend to think of the units as static , whereas they are constantly flowing , changing , and influencing one another . If we knew better the history of peoples like Negritos , Seris , or even Gypsies , or if we kept more in mind the total composite history of peoples like the French and the Bretons , we would realize more clearly the continuity of the material of culture , and how its segregations are never complete . In their origin and their history even the greatest and richest cultures are only parts of the great nexus of human culture as a whole . I2I . RURAL AND URBAN  --  FOLK AND SOPHISTICATE FACETS It is customary to distinguish rural and urban components in modern populations . There are of course corresponding rural and urban facets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whole societies and cultures can be classified into those predominantly rural or predominantly urban . India , China , and Czarist Russia will serve as examples of the one ; England or Massachusetts // of the other  --  or even Australia , recent as it is , with the majority of its inhabitants living in its capital cities . In this familiar form , the rural-urban distinction is well enough known to need no detailed analysis  --  except for one comment on a fundamental though obvious fact . The rural condition is the underlying one , logically and historically : there must be a country area producing more food than it consumes before other people can live in cities . On the widest consideration , the rural-urban differentiation is a somewhat special and modern form of a more general distinction of societies and cultures into those which are more folklike and those which are more sophisticated or " civilized . " This is not an either-or segregation . Rather we must conceive of a line or an axis along which societies and cultures , or the part-cultures of segments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole of greatest folklike or tribal backwardness to the opposite pole of greatest sophistication . The concept is of some importance because it gathers in and subsumes a series of diverse but related recognitions that have gradually become established in social science . A characteristic folk culture or tribal culture belongs to a small , isolated , close-knit society , in which person-to-person relations are prevalent , kinship is a dominant factor , and organization , both societal and cultural , is therefore largely on a basis of kinship  --  sometimes including fictitious kinship , as in many clans and moieties . By contrast , political institutions are weakly developed : " primitive democracy " is the characteristic form ; but this denotes only a maximum of equality coexisting with a minimum of authority or control . Such a way of doing works because of the strong integration within the small group involved . Everyone knows everyone else , and many of them are blood or afhinal relatives . ' It has long been noted that there seems to be a spontaneous upper limit of tribal size : probably around five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this limit is transcended , the society breaks into two , often painlessly . Where " tribes " of fifty or a hundred thousand or a million persons are spoken of , they are either organized into a supertribal state , or they are really no longer tribes , but nationalities . Nationalities possess a culture and a speech that they recognize as common in essentials , but they may constitute many societies . This means that , in the case of a nationality , ethnically and culturally we are dealing with a single people , but politically often with multiple independent societies , each one autonomous and owning its own distinct tract of land . Such would be populations like the Lolo , the Ifugao , the Maya , all of whom are sometimes inaccurately called " tribes " when they really are multiple-society nationalities of nearly uniform culture . The mere fact of the narrowness of range of their social integration holds them near the folk end of the polar axis . ' // It is also the smallness of the maximal social unit which keeps folk populations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings of class divisions , or slender concentrations of residence in permanent towns . Folk societies are attached to their soil emotionally by ties of habit , and economically by experience . Consequently they belong to that group of societies which identify themselves with their locality , in contrast to the sophisticated city dwellers who float without roots but take pride in living in their era and day and are therefore constantly subject to the play of fashion ( 121 , 164 , 253 ) . Finally , it is folk societies that are specially dominated in their culture and their behavior by the folkways discussed in 116 . Their moral and religious sense is therefore strong . They believe in the sacred things ; their sense of right and wrong springs from unconscious roots of social feeling , and is therefore unreasoned , compulsive , and strong . Folk cultures afford their individual members full participation in their functioning  --  they invite and encourage such participation ; their functioning , however limited and inadequate , is therefore personalized and saturated . The relatively small range of their culture content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation of scope , all make for a sharpness of patterns in the culture , which are well characterized , consistent , and interrelated . Narrowness , depth , and intensity are the qualities of folk cultures . Maturely civilized societies are inevitably large . A population that has become great , whether by its own growth , by absorption , or by the welding together of originally independent groups , inevitably becomes depersonalized on the one hand , individualized on the other . The kin group , of lifelong close associates bound by affective ties , has lost its force , except for the immediate or biological family , and often partly even within that . In consequence , each individual 's relations with others take on an impersonal character . There are now numerous such relations , but most of them are special , limited , shallow , without emotional implications . We do not know our milkman , who in fact probable represents a corporation none of whose members we have ever set eyes on . And as for the actual delivery driver , if we do now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting or a comment on the weather : we do not invite him to dinner or serf ously exchange views on religion or social problems with him . If we have real business with him , such as ordering an extra quart , we usually make sure of it by leaving him a note in an empty bottle  --  about as impersonal and unemotional a method as there is . In fact , most writing and all printing are inevitably indirect , remote , and " denatured " as regards feeling , compared with face-to-face contact . Writing , then , greatly reinforces population size as a joint cause of the growing impersonalization of higher civilization . So do large-scale urbanization and mechanical industrialization . The four constitute a set of interdependent causes , and of intercorrelated effects as well // At the same time , kin and associative groups , which were dominant under tribal culture , have lost most of their strength and influence , and the large total society being only remotely and mechanically interested in persons , the individual has become relatively free . He is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose his own contacts and to change them . There is nothing to hold him in the course of his forefathers , nor even in his own original course . Individuals therefore become highly differentiated  --  not indeed in their inner personality , which the immense society and great culture have difficulty in reaching intimately  --  but in their behavior , their actions . This differentiation corresponds to the differentiation of labor and profession . With it also there tends to go a certain instability . This shows in the fluctuating careers of individuals : they may live here today , there tomorrow , with ever new associates but perhaps never close friends . On the sociocultural side it shows in the fluctuations of fashion , not only of dress but of fads , novelties , amusements , and the fleeting popularity of persons as well as things ( 164 , 253 ) . The influence of the total sociocultural mass on the individual is probably as great as in the small folk society ; but it is indirect , remote , " mechanical , " because it is impersonal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than toward association based on spatial contiguity . With this diluting and spreading of the fervid intensities of attachment , it is inevitable that religiosity , piety , regard for the sacred things , should tend to evaporate with civilization . Shrines become show places rather than spots of worship . Criticism and rationalism grow . As beliefs fade that have rested largely on the social dictation of a homogeneous small group , empirical and actual knowledge comes to seem more desirable , and accumulates . Faith in the supernatural and the magical gives way to faith in science . The culture and the life are secularized . Here again dilution of the affective social group into impersonality goes hand in hand with rationalization , secularization , and urbanization : each tends to produce the others and to be further produced by them . It is evident that our present-day Western civilization is near one polar end  --  the most urbanized , lay , depersonalized , sophisticatedly civilized end  --  of an axis that can be traced through all societies and cultures . Basically this classification or ranging on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integration of the group . It is however expressed also in culture , and apparently more emphatically so ; namely , as secularization , ceaselessness of the swings of fashion , and cultural instability . Even the rural-urban and tribal-state distinctions deal with forms that are cultural as well as social . And finally , there is a psychological expression of the polarity , manifest in affectiveness , depersonalization of relations , and the like . Of course , intergradations occur all along the axis . China , for instance , and India are markedly less **33;0;TOOLONG than Western countries , but much more so than most tribal nationalities . // An intermediate place is occupied also by peasantry . Peasants are definitely rural  --  yet live in relation to market towns ; they form a class segment of a larger population which usually contains also urban centers , sometimes metropolitan capitals . They constitute part-societies with part-cultures . They lack the isolation , the political autonomy , and the self-sufficiency of tribal populations ; but their local units retain much of their old identity , integration , and attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European country alongside growing urbanization and industrialization all through the nineteenth century , and they had been modified but were by no means extinct when the crash of World War II overwhelmed the Continent . In Russia , four-fifths of the population in 1917 consisted of ex-serf peasants . New countries rapidly settled by large-scale immigration , such as the United States and Australia , leave small room for peasant conditions or attitudes . There is too little rooting in the soil , too little stability or knitting together by kinship , for local particularity as expressed in folk custom or peasant art to develop . However , a close approximation to a true peasantry did develop in those Latin American countries like Mexico , Guatemala , Peru , and Bolivia where the Spanish conquest froze the bulk of the native population resident on the land into a depressed class living under its own partial or folk culture . In later prehistory , after food production had become established , a number of societies exhibit rather conspicuous peasantlike qualities : the Neolithic Europeans , for instance , including the Swiss lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other early Indo-Europeans ( 305 ) . These are all peoples who had become settled but , either from newness or from remoteness , had made little progress toward urbanization . The Near East may have gone through a similar phase on which we are less well informed because it happened two to three thousand years earlier . And there were sonic interesting national differences in this regard ; as between Mesopotamia and Egypt , for instance . In these two lands amorphous folk cultures grew simultaneously into early civilizations , with writing , towns , political organization , metallic industry . But during the last millennium before Christ , Mesopotamia had become sophisticatedly civilized , with a conquered empire , great cities of metro . politan character like Babylon , and prosecution of true science ; whereas Egypt had stood nearly still for a thousand years . This difference was perhaps partly due to the fact that the population of Egypt consisted overwhelmingly of a rural peasantry , capped by little else than a governing bureaucracy . The question fairly arises whether the trend from the rural to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gradual extinction of religion and morality , as might seem inferable from the strength that the mores and beliefs in the sacra retain in localized folk cultures , but tend to lose in civilization . In short , can we project this tendency , so apparent at the present day , and perhaps most strongly so in Western civilization , forward into the future to a vanishing-point ? In line with such a trend is the fact that as time has gone on , stater ns empires have been growing larger ; and that " universal " states and church a // universal in the Toynbee sense of aiming at totality  --  are regular and expectable phases in the growth of major civilizations . However , any prophecy resting on the extrapolation or projection of a trend assumes that the trend is constant . There is no proof that such constancy holds throughout for the change from folk culture to sophisticate civilization . We know of pieces of history that show the change ; our own American contemporary history is impressively so oriented ; and over the total range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . But the trend is not universal and is not irreversible . For instance , following Alexander the Great 's conquest and the fusion of mature Greek and mature western-Asiatic civilizations , there first occurred a conspicuous development of many of the symptoms that characterize modern life : withering of the closer social ties , along with decay of beliefs and piety , democratization , growth of population , cities and larger states , industrialization , marked accumulation of knowledge , general sophistication . This culture period is known as Hellenistic ; in the early Roman Empire its character was both accentuated and spread to the western Mediterranean . However , from the beginning of the breakdown of the Roman Empire in the third century , the drift was reversed in most respects . The international state fell apart ; the fragments had little intercommunication ; loyalties became ethnic , often tribal ; outlooks were parochial , at best provincial , instead of metropolitan . Cities shrank tremendously ; the self-sufficient economic unit now was the rural villa . Knowledge and education decreased ; religious convictions under Christianity were far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paganism . The outcome was the western-European " Dark Ages " of rural custom , ignorance , piety , and folkway dominance , from which our own civilization made its first step of gradual emergence when it attained to mediaevalism . In the East , Constantinople and in a measure Alexandria indeed remained great cities of wealth and sophistication for some centuries longer . But they finally fell before the expansion of Islamic society , whose culture must in some ways be regarded as recessive also ; it certainly aimed at simplification . There have presumably been other reversals in history . The overturn from the Indus Valley civilization to that of the Vedic Aryans certainly signified the partial triumph of rural folkway living ( 105 ) . And even primitives vary considerably in the strength of their piety and animistic beliefs ( 250 ) . It may therefore be fairly concluded that movement along the rural-urban , folk-sophisticate axis is not necessarily one-way or predestined . It is of interest in this connection that Soviet doctrine aims at bringing about a condition closely resembling one of the polar extremes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only one class of citizens , speaking a single language ; what remains of other idioms and of regional customs will be harmless nostalgic remembrances of the order of folk songs and dances ( 182 ) . Life will be fully industrialized , according to the Soviet program ; it will be lived urbanly even on the farm . Knowledge and enlightenment will be // universal ; religion will be defunct , rationalism in full control , the individual a willing , depersonalized cog serving the ends of the universal community . It is really rather curious how closely the goal of Communism approximates an anticipatory projection or sensing from the drift of the last two or three centuries : it is like a Lindberghian " wave of the future . " Finally , the folk-sophisticate polarity , especially when it is viewed not so much as a scale but as a one-way drift , definitely overlaps with the emotionally tinged idea of " progress " that is discussed farther on in this chapter , in 127-128 . I22 . INTEGRATION  --  INHERENT OR INDUCED The double proposition can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture was produced outside of it , but that the highly composite product nevertheless is regularly felt as something coherent and integrated , and normally is accepted as " right . " It is so accepted because the average individual is so thoroughly under the influence of his culture , has been so molded by it in growing up and adjusting to it , that even its incoherences and contradictions tend to be taken for granted as if they were logically sound and a-priori evident . It must be remembered also that any " average " individual knows little or nothing through convincing personal experience of other cultures , so that his own must appear to him as being natural and inevitable . He accepts his culture , his social inheritance , as he accepts the surrounding atmosphere he breathes , or as a fish accepts water . What is fifty years old in this culture and what is three thousand years old touch him alike and affect him alike . So do elements that the culture originated , and elements which were introduced into it . Thus it is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a homogeneous unit . It is only dissective analysis and knowledge of history that reveal the corn positeness of any culture . As regards the historical origin of its contents , accordingly , every civilization is what Lowie has called it : a " thing of shreds and patches , " a " planless bodge podge " ; but it does not ordinarily seem so to the people living under it , nor does it function as such . Every culture is an accretion to a far greater degree tlian any living organism . It is the end product of a long series of events occurring mostly in other cultures , accidents from its own point of view , but ultimately of influence upon it . Plan or pattern there always is  --  and in some ways its pot tern is the most important thing about any culture  --  see the whole next chapter nevertheless , as regards origin , plan or pattern is secondary . The plan moulilies the cultural material that flows in , sometimes rejects it , fits it all , native and foreign , into something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society can get along under tolerably and some of them successfully .111 ( 1 pleasantly . It is patternings that produce the internal consistency . But it is important to recognize that cultures do not start with a pattern or predetermined plan and then fill it in . That is what inveterate reformers and dreamers of // Utopias do . Actual societies tend to evolve the plan of their cultures as the content of these grows . And the plan changes as introduced content changes , although traits of internal origin  --  innovations  --  are likely to develop in accord with the way the pattern-plan stands at the moment . In short , cultures are constantly and automatically acquiring or reacquiring a sort of integration . But this is a very different thing from the organic integration that holds together , say , a grasshopper or a rabbit . This organic integration involves a pattern of finished animal that is essentially predetermined when two germ cells unite to start a new individual . Cultural integration  --  or for that matter human social integration  --  is invariably of a much looser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely inflowing parts , into a more or less workable fit . It is not a growth of parts unfolding from a germ in accord with a pre-existing harmonious master plan . Such an unfolding has often been assumed , insinuated , or asserted by writers as diverse as Frazer , Spengler , and Malinowski . But it remains wholly undemonstrated , and history shows it to be at least partly untrue . The point sometimes made , as by Radcliffe-Brown , that every society is confronted by the constant problem of how it is to preserve or maintain itself , seems a false analogy with the organic world , where the struggle for existence mostly is indeed keen . But when one society incorporates another , it does not ordinarily destroy it , except perhaps as a conceptually separate entity . Its members go on living under somewhat altered conditions ; the frame of the society has been enlarged ; whereas if a society splits , there merely are two instead of one . Culture we have seen to be even more plastic than societies in merging , partly merging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to maintain themselves , they are evidently not aware of a constant need of self-preservation ; nor indeed are men , who are the most conscious of organisms . Food is necessary to life , and animals get hungry and set about satisfying their hunger , with pleasure if successful ; but they do not feel it as an unremitting problem of self-preservation . That is rather the intellectual attitude of philosophers , or emotionally of neurotics . When it comes to societies and cultures , the problem of preservation seems even more philosophical and remote . The normal attitude of the normal man probably is that his society and culture were , are , and will be . If anything , he is likely to assume more perpetuity for them than they possess . And not without reason . Most cultures do continue for quite a while . Sooner or later they may be superseded , or altered out of recognition ; but ordinarily there is no immediate prospect whatever of that . In fact , what has impressed most observers is the power of persistence of cultures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually to suit the reformer . Every nation or tribe has its conservative party , whether it is so labeled or not . There is nothing mystical in this faculty of cultures to maintain themselves and to resist overrapid alteration . Any culture , even the lowly one // In summary , heredity gives us at birth certain generic human faculties . How we shall use these , and therefore how we shall mainly live , the culture in which we are launched thereupon decides . But it leaves us , theoretically at least , certain choices between alternatives in its total scheme ; and it leaves us also a degree of freedom of departure from its norms in personal mannerisms , innovations , and successes . This enormous influence of culture in molding the individual has a bearing on psychology . This science is set up to study particular individuals in order to reach understanding of human beings in general ; that is , of what might be called the abstracted human person . But since all individuals as they actually occur in life are patterned by culture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology is made difficult . This was not clear at first . But then psychologists began to realize how great was the effect on individuals of their happening to be exposed to different influences , as these exist within our civilization ; how the children of articulate parents generally come to be aboveaverage in verbal facility ; how the children of unhappy or broken marriages are more likely than the average to be emotionally unstable in their adjustments to other persons ; and so on . So " conditioning " came to be one of the slogans of modern psychology where innateness of behavior had been assumed before . Then , as psychologists gradually came to be culture-conscious also , the variety of cultures was seen to increase enormously the range of the conditioning people are subject to . The abstract man , or what the psychologist felt he could properly say about him , shrank in proportion . This is why there is such great difficulty , as we have seen ( 86-9o ) , in deciding how alike or different the heredity equipment of races or descent groups is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tests are valid enough , within limits , within the culture for which they were constructed . They show at any rate how much culture an individual has absorbed in comparison with other individuals . They are less good at showing , per se , whether greater absorption is due to greater exposure or to greater inborn capacity . And the tests break down , or become dubious , when they are applied interculturally . Hence it is that we do not yet know how different the races arc in their endowment , while we do know that cultures differ enormously in content and orientation . And of course individuals differ both in their heredity and in what their conditioning has made them . 124 . PARTICIPATION Besides differing in heredity and conditioning , individuals also differ in degree of participation in their culture . How large a share does a given person hold in the stock company of his society , and what dividends of satisfaction does it pay him ? It is evident that the complex culture carried by a large society is just too big for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its many departments . It is only the exceptionally gifted or favored member of a large // society who can hope to operate successfully in a number of its more important activities . The run-of-the-mill man is likely to be equipped to follow only one or two occupations out of hundreds or thousands of existing ones , and to have a run-of-the-mill income , wife , home , a run-of-the-mill seat in the church or at the game , run-of-the-mill tastes , thoughts , and habits . With a little bad luck , he may even come out below-average in all or most of these things . In a culture full of books he may not read a newspaper ; in a land of wealth he may be ragged and half-famished . This is the counterpart , the seamy side , of what has already been discussed in 118 : that large societies make for division of labor and specialization of function , therefore for professional training , advances in the arts , and inventions or at least improvements in the ways of living . But as the total culture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each member of the society really to participate in most of its activities . He begins to be an onlooker at most of it , then a bystander , and may end up with indifference to the welfare of his society and the values of his culture . He falls back upon the immediate problems of his livelihood and the narrowing range of enjoyments still open to him , because he senses that his society and his culture have become indifferent to him . If the society and the culture retain a degree of integration , the lower classes may participate vicariously : in imagination , by symbols or through pageantry . The British lower classes participate thus in the life of the aristocracy , which is so much richer than theirs , and even more in the doings of the royal court . No doubt Egyptian peasant-serfs of five thousand years ago got some similar satisfactions out of what went on in the god-king 's entourage at Memphis , or even when they contemplated his pyramid tomb over which they sweated for years in a labor draft . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and costly courts is precisely to serve as symbols increasing the integration of large societies . But vicarious participation at best is partial , and iCmay be lacking . Wherever there exists a true urban proletariat , or where the mass of country people are outright serfs , a large part of the population is participating very incompletely in their culture and being denied many of its satisfactions . This in t urn means that those who are most largely supporting the culture economically ; ire getting the least of its rewards ; and , reciprocally , that the values of the culture are being continued in their development by only a fraction of the society . Most revolutions , successful and unsuccessful , seem to be preceded by such a condition of imperfect participation . Only we must remember that there is no absolute scale of measurement . A sufficient discrepancy in one country between actual participation and what is considered possible participation will bring on efforts at remedy ; whereas elsewhere there may be even less participation by most of the society in most of the culture , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is endured fatalistically . Thus the French Revolution was precipitated not because the oppression and the nonparticipation of the // lower classes were extreme : as a matter of fact , their situation was better than in some other European countries which did not revolt , and on the whole it had probably improved in the generation before 1789 . But just because France was the home of enlightenment and considered itself the most highly civilized country in the world , the gap between top and bottom was felt keenly and engendered the revolution . The Russian muzhik had probably achieved even less participation by the early twentieth century . Nor is it probable that Russia left to itself would have achieved a deep-going social revolution at one stroke . But conscious Westernization , initiated by Peter the Great two centuries before , finally brought in its train also the Marxian ideology , which was organized to operate by revolution on the gap of nonparticipation , and had as its ultimate aim the abolition of the gap . Marxism completely missed its own prediction of first succeeding in the most highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginal area of low industrialization , because the standard of living and cultural participation of the population in Russia had remained unduly low for **26;35;TOOLONG Europe  --  and for **34;63;TOOLONG Russian intellectuals . The contrast of all this of course is with primitive cultures . Here societal units are small ; skills , differentiations , and privileges are limited ; and participations are reasonably equal . No one is evicted for nonpayment of rent , or left on the sidewalk to watch the prosperous stream into the opera . The simpler cultures have simpler and smaller problems to meet . Much of the eighteenth century admiration of the romantic and unspoiled savage , and our own occa sional hankerings after South Sea island idylls , stem from a vague sense of this fact . To be sure , it is well to remember that if the Ifugao and the Yurok and other nonliterate people did not evict , they did enforce debt slavery ; and that others practiced war enslavement , human sacrifice , and cannibalism . Yet the total range of activities remained small enough so that even a slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serf elsewhere , or than a free outcaste in India . Larger and richer cultures just do have bigger and harder social problems to solve . I25 . CONTENT AND FORM ; ETHOS AND ETHOS : VALUES It is worth while to examine briefly certain overlapping distinctions amen several aspects of culture . They are : content and form of culture ; ethos an ethos ; and material and nonmaterial culture . The content of a culture is the sum of the items of which it is composed things present in it  --  whether present or lacking in other cultures . For instance kingship , hereditary titles of nobility , a state church , stringent libel and divine laws , driving left on the road , spelling labor and honor with a , are several or little items contained in British civilization but not in its close American // counterpart . However , British and American culture share as content steam engines and railways , alphabetic writing , representative parliamentary government , dairy foods , and many other items that until recently were wholly lacking in , say , China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accumulate in the aggregate cultures of mankind , and to a certain extent even in one culture , and thus to give the impression of progress taking place ( 127 ) , though the process may actually be one largely of quantitative enlargement . Cultural form is harder to describe or illustrate . We might approximate it by saying it is what is left over when we subtract cultural content from culture , What is this remnant ? It may be a rearrangement , a transfer of an item or a group of items to other departments of the culture , to another of its jurisdictions . Thus education can be in clerical or in lay hands ; schools may be parochial or public , as we say in America , parish or board in Britain . The education given may be very similar . In its elementary stages it is bound to be practically identical : C a t will spell cat and 3 X 3 = 9 whether the school and the teacher be democratic , religious , communist , or fascist . Yet we all know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be different  --  different enough to fight for , often . This is not wholly an affair of totalitarian propaganda aiming to thrive by liquidating everything else . Such extreme propaganda began to be developed chiefly some years after World War I. Yet even before then it obviously mattered who controlled the schools . Besides content , such as reading and arithmetic , education inevitably imparts an ideology , a system of beliefs and sentiments and values , which if accepted is all-important for its influence on conduct . An ideology or a system might also be called a pattern or configuration ; that is , a way of arranging things . Theoretically , one might conceive of two cultures whose itemized content was identical , and which yet differed in the form or arrangement or system or pattern of this content . Actually , form and content are far too interwoven for just such a situation to arise ; but the hypothetical example will help point out what is meant by cultural form . A system or configuration is always , in its nature , more than the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parts , their total interconnections , which add up to something additionally significant . This is well recognized in " Gestalt " or configurational psychology . The " form " of culture may therefore be regarded as the pattern of interrelations of the contents that constitute it . Somewhat related to the foregoing are a contrasting pair of aspects that have been called the ethos and the eidos of culture . Greek eidos , from which we have " idol " as a derivative , denotes form or appearance or likeness . The eidos of a culture would therefore be its appearance , its phenomena , all that about it which can be described explicitly . This would primarily coincide with cultural content as just discussed . The Greek word ethos , from which we have " ethics , " denotes first of all disposition . With reference to a people , it means their ways or customs , corresponding nearly to the Latin mores . Like that term , it carries an implica294 THE // tion of what is sanctioned and expected . Hence the connotation of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derivative Christian use of the words " ethical " and " moral " in their everyday sense . However , when we speak of the ethos of a culture , we revert at least part-way to the original Greek meaning , and refer not so much to the specific ethics or moral code of the culture as to its total quality , to what would constitute disposition or character in an individual ; to the system of ideals and values that dominate the culture and so tend to control the type of behavior of its members . Thus , we might say that the ethos of Italian Renaissance culture was sensuous and passionate , but that of the northern-European Reformation , puritan and ascetic . Hindu civilization is not only otherworldly but mystical , rationalizing , and extravagant in its ethos ; Chinese , this-worldly , prosily moralistic , and matter-of-fact . The Japanese ethos differs from the Chinese in putting more emphasis on action , precision of form , and neatness . It will be evident from these examples that ethos deals with qualities that pervade the whole culture  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separable constituents that make up its formal appearance and are the eidos . The ethos includes the direction in which a culture is oriented , the things it aims at , prizes and endorses , and more or less achieves . We are here getting into metaphors that personify culture as if it had a will and a purpose of its own . That is a fault of the language of our day . Scientific thinking has penetrated so recently into these fields that it has failed as yet to work out its own more exact expressions . When we say that a culture aims at , prizes , and achieves certain ends , that is a shorthand way of saying that most of the members of a society , through having been molded by its culture , aim at , prize , and help achieve those ends . The ends or things referred to , the qualities that differentiate one culture from another , are undoubtedly distinctive , are genuine attributes of phenomena of history and nature . The difference between Western , Indian , and Far Eastern civilizations obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by items of the order of eating with forks , fingers , and chopsticks respectively . Beyond these concrete facts , there is a pervading difference of character and outlook in the three cultures . That is what is meant by ethos . It is evident that the ethos of a culture is pretty close to what a philosopher or a historian might call its system of values . This somewhat technical term d notes something that physical and biological scientists are agreed they can not properly deal with by their methods , and therefore ought , as scientists , to leave alone  --  though most of them admit that there are such things as values , mot .11 or otherwise , and personally try to live up to them . Whatever " values " arc , it n clear that they have some relation to culture . Cultures differ in their values ; each one shapes , or at least colors , its own . Values in this technical or philosophical sense might be informally defined as those things  --  cultural products , standards , or ideas  --  which men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ int . // portance , for them , for their group and descendants , and in themselves , over and beyond their practical utility . Christianity is one of the great values of our society and culture ; so are the works of Shakespeare , and our democratic institutions and liberty  --  even the Liberty Bell , as a visible and tangible symbol . In China , Confucius would represent a similar value . No one would deny that these values influence human conduct and constitute real phenomena and effective forces in the world of history , and therefore of nature . This is true even though these same values have not been measured , and are regarded by the physicist and biologist as beyond the scope of their sciences . For the present , let us carry in mind that values exist and that they are tied up with culture . We shall be coming back to them again . I26 . MATERIAL AND NONMATERIAL CULTURE A distinction often made between material and nonmaterial culture is mentioned here only as probably having no first-rank significance . The literal difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas e But do they stand for something basically different ? Do they function with significant difference in culture ? The answer seems No . What counts is not the physical ax or coat or wheat but the idea of them , the knowledge how to produce and use them , their place in life . It is this knowledge , concept , and function that get themselves handed down through the generations , or diffused into other cultures , while the objects themselves are quickly worn out or consumed . It is the ax itself that is effective in chopping , the idea of the ax that is effective in getting axes made and available for use . In fact we can almost conceive of the ax as an institution , as we can certainly speak of lumbering and wearing clothes and grain farming in a sense entirely parallel to the institutions of marriage or churchgoing . The attempt to segregate material from nonmaterial traits of culture perhaps derives from a white-collar distinction unfortunately long made in Germany between Naturwissenschaften and Geisteswissenschaften : sciences dealing with nature and sciences dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call the humanities and the social sciences . But there is nothing gained by implying that since humanistic and social studies have to do with the " spirit " or " mind , " whereas natural science deals with tangible objects , the latter is therefore of a different and lower order . Such a point of view smacks of old-fashioned theology with its contrasting of body and soul . Genuine science is characterized first of all by its method , only secondarily by subject matter , except that this must be in nature and must consist of phenomena . My having learned how to write // or being a Christian are phenomena ; and equally so are the alphabet and Christianity and ax-using ; and so are axes and clothes and chairs ; and they are all parts of culture . Accordingly we may forget about this distinction between material and nonmaterial culture , except as a literal difference that it is sometimes of practical convenience to observe . I27 . THE IDEA OF PROGRESS One of the most widely held preconceptions is that culture is progressive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a trite one . Simple or primitive peoples are labeled " unprogressive . " The implied picture is of a continuous moving forward and onward . Popularly , evolution is almost synonymous with progress ; and progress means advance to something better . Actually , the idea of progress is itself a culture phenomenon of some interest . Strange as it may seem to us , most of humanity during most of its history was not imbued at all with the idea . An essentially static world , a nearly static mankind , were most likely to be taken for granted . If there was any notion of alteration , a deterioration from the golden age of the beginnings was as frequently believed in as an advance . A definite system of belief in progress began to acquire strength only in eighteenth-century Europe . Reinforced by the French Revolution , it became a sort of article of liberal faith in the nineteenth century . It entered into the philosophy of Comte and Spencer . The latter saw evolution as a manifestation of progress . Darwin , who propounded a mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism about which the man in the street is mostly still a bit hazy  --  was popularly acclaimed as having " proved evolution "  --  that is , progress . The Unitarian profession of faith is interesting in this connection : " I believe in the Fatherhood of God , the brotherhood of Man , the leadership of Jesus , salvation by character , the progress of mankind , onward and upward forever . " There is a certain nobility about this sentiment of liberal ism ; but it is as indubitably a sentiment and a dogma , and not a scientific con elusion , as are the Apostles ' Creed and the Thirty-nine Articles . Progress has largely taken the place of Jesus in this most denatured branch of Christianity . But the concept of progress is far from being limited to that . If a poll were taken , devout Methodists and other Trinitarians would undoubtedly favor progress overwhelmingly and believe it to be enjoined by religion . So widespread is the modern attachment to the idea that even many strict fundamental . ists would be shocked if told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some re . maining inclination to balk at " evolution " as non-Biblical . These instances are mentioned to show , first , that the concept of the progress of humanity is a special characteristic of contemporary Western civilization ; next , that within this civilization it generally has the force of an a-priori assumption ; and finally that , like most a priori 's , it is adhered to with considcrs // fervor of emotion . All this does not disprove progress ; but it does show that progress is something to be analyzed rather than taken for granted . Now in a grand , over-all sort of way , there has undoubtedly been progress in human culture in the last quarter-million years . We are undeniably " higher " or " more advanced " culturally than the Acheulians , in much the same way that a mammal is higher than an Ordovician sponge or brachiopod . The real questions in this connection are : In what does progress consist ? and , Is progress continuous and inevitable ? Let us consider these interrelated questions . We have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an additive and therefore accumulative one , whereas the process of organic evolution is primarily a substitutive one . When men acquire flight , they add it to their former faculties ; when birds acquired it , they converted a pair of legs into wings . One might thus fairly enough suspect that new culture tended to be incremental and not replacing ; and that therefore the total stock of culture of any society , and of humanity as a whole , would show a normal inclination to grow . All in all , the verdict of history confirms such a judgment . There may have been occasional periods of stress for this or that society in which its total inventory of cultural items diminished . There is nothing to show that such hard times and shrinkages ever extended simultaneously to all the societies on earth . While one particular form of civilization is undergoing atrophy or decay , neighboring ones are usually coming into vigor . What Egyptian culture lost from 800 to 1 B.c.  --  if it did lose in total bulk  --  was more than made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mesopotamian , Persian , Greek , and Roman cultures . The Dark Ages of western Europe , around A.D. 450 to 750 , denote a period of breakup of an old pattern system before the patterns of a new system had been developed very far , with a resulting loss of political stability , intellectual and aesthetic achievements , urban refinement , and wealth ; and in consequence very few superior men were able to realize themselves as " geniuses . " But the historians most conversant with the era would probably find it difficult to say how much the total stock of western-European culture contracted during the Dark Ages , or to be wholly sure that it did contract seriously . Knowledge of Plato and Aristotle certainly was both less and rarer , and roads were not kept in as good repair ; but useful and important new things like horseshoes and water mills ( 183 ) became commoner . In any event , while Europe was perhaps receding , China was inventing printing and otherwise advancing . Recessions in civilization , in short , either are local and likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns or organization and the values of their products  --  cultural qualities . And it does seem clear that in an over-all sort of way the sum total of culture of mankind has pretty continuously grown in bulk through history . As // new artifacts and faculties are developed , the old ones tend to sink to a relatively more limited or humbler sphere , but rarely become entirely lost . Candles survive in the age of electricity , horses alongside motorcars , the bow beside firearms ( 159 ) ; bronze has its special uses and virtues in the age of iron , and iron in that of steel . We use stone in more ways in modern civilization than Old Stone Age men did , although it was of primary significance to them but is only subsidiary to us . Quantitatively , then , civilization advances because it tends in its nature to be accumulative ; and to this extent the modern a priori of progress is justified . But will the admission of a mere swelling of bulk satisfy those who wish to believe in progress ? Mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or toward more ideal values . And there of course we get on subjective terrain . Is the philosophy of Plato or St. Thomas or Kant the highest and most valuable ? Answers are obviously going to be colored by nationality and religion . A good Hindu might put all three of them lower than Sankara . Everyone will appreciate the values his own civilization has developed . Egocentricity in the form of ethnocentricity is inevitably injected into the problem , and makes the objective attack difficult . It is pleasant to believe in progress  --  which makes my times and my ways superior to all others  --  as it is pleasant to believe in the superiority of my nationality , my religion , my race , my language  --  my town or county even , my family , and myself . Let us try , however , despite this emotional cloud , to discover something scientific or objective to justify a degree of acceptance of the progress idea . There are three approaches that seem to yield at least a partial standard of what constitutes " higher " or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first is the criterion of magic and " superstition . " In proportion as a culture disengages itself from reliance on these , it may be said to have registered an advance . In proportion as it admits magic in its operations , it remains primitive or retarded . This seemingly dogmatic judgment is based on the observation that beliefs in magic , such as are normal in backward societies , do recur in cultures that by profession have discarded magic , but chiefly among individuals whose social fortune is backward or who are psychotic , mentally deteriorated , or otherwise subnormal . When the sane and well in one culture believe what only the most ignorant , warped , and insane believe in another , there would seem to be some warrant for rating the first culture lower and the second higher . Or are our discards , insane , and hypersuggestibles perhaps right and the rest of us wrong ? For instance , a Lassik Indian woman in California lost and buried her baby . The next afternoon she heard a child crying overhead and fell over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the crying of the baby , and got progressively more ill . She engaged a shaman doctor to cure her , who finally said : " It is // your own child 's shadow ( soul ) coming back to urge you to accept him as a spirit helper aiding you to become a shaman yourself . " This woman did not happen to want such supernatural power , and so she began to argue with her baby 's shadow when its voice reappeared to urge her . She remained firm and told him to leave her alone , until finally he desisted , and she became well again . To be a shaman is an honored and respected status among most of the Californian tribes , and many individuals accept such spirit offers . In this event they gradually learn to tolerate association with the spirit , therewith recover their own health , and then profess and try to cure other people with the assistance of their invisible helper . It is clear that in these societies there is complete social and cultural acceptance of spirits and their ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shaman who is so aided , and of the place of the shaman in the community . But in our culture a person who falls sick , hears voices , communicates with shadows , and acquires special abilities from them is inevitably classed as deranged . Thousands of similar cases might be cited . They provide a consistent criterion of distinction between primitive or folk cultures and advanced or high cultures , apart from the respective quantity of content . The backward cultures in their magic , shamanism , animistic ritual , recognize as objectively effective certain phenomena that the advanced cultures regard as objectively unreal and as subjectively psychotic or deranged . The limits of relation of personality and world are differently drawn in the two series of cultures . What higher cultures stigmatize as personal , nonreal and nonsocial , abnormal and pathological , lower cultures treat as objective , conducive to ability , and socially useful . It will be seen that the difference is in terms of socialization as well as reality . Backward peoples assume as actual certain phenomena to which we grant only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense in which tangible human bodies or animals or stones are real . Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that retarded peoples are also aware of a distinction but invert the emphasis . To them a child or a hawk or a stone seen or heard in a certain kind of dream or trance is much more important than a physical child or hawk or stone that one can touch and handle , because it is the possible source of much more power . Certain things we classify as unreal the primitive considers superreal  --  with the result that his world often seems " surrealistically " fantastic to us . From this follows the difference in socialization . To us a person who hears the ( lead speak , or who thinks that he can turn into a bear or a wolf , is socially subnormal , socially useless , and likely to be a burden and an upset to the community . But among primitives he is a personality of special , enhanced , and productive powers , which he may indeed abuse in witchcraft , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , surer food supply , victory over enemies , and similar benefits . So the primitive weighs and favors the magical where we reject and try to exclude it . Our values rather than our per . // ceptions differ from his . He recognizes , standardizes , rewards certain psychotic or neurotic experiences  --  socially channels them  --  which we regard as well outside our socially approved channels . It is important for a clear grasp of the foregoing view to realize that it has no reference to the supernatural as such . Belief in God is not a sign of backwardness . All that is contended is that the bestowal of social rewards for the inability to distinguish subjective experiences from objective phenomena , or for the deliberate inversion of the two , is a presumable mark of lack of progress . In so far , then , as the mentally unwell in modern advanced cultures tend to correspond to the well and the influential in ancient and retarded cultures , at least in certain situations , we can accept objective progress as having taken place . I28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traits that characterize backward as against advanced cultures . These have to do with the obtrusion of physiological or anatomical considerations into social situations , or with the related matter of the taking of human life . Some of these practices are : blood or animal sacrifice ; segregation of women at parturition and menstruation as being contaminating to others ; contamination by death or corpses , often with segregation of mourners until purified ; puberty crisis rites , especially for girls at the onset of physiological puberty ; preoccupation with the dead body , including mummification , skull preservation and skull cult , wearing of skull or jaw by widows , disinterment and reburial , eating of bits of the body or of cremation ashes ; ritual prostitution and inversion ; human sacrifice ; retainer burial ; head-hunting ; cannibalism . These practices almost invariably contain an element of the magical or the supernatural , and so far as they do they are allied to the class of traits we have just reviewed as being apparently characteristic of cultural retardation . But they contain also a second element , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aversion , disgust , revulsion , or the shame of bad taste . This other element has as its common denominator what strikes us as the gratuitous obtrusion into public recognition and the social order of physiological happenings , including blood and death and decay , which we tend to regard .1s matters best kept private and unemphasized , and their public obtrusion as u n pleasant and useless . Deformation of the head by pressure , filing or knocking out of the teeth , pattern scarifications , distention of lips and ear lobes and other anatomical mutilations , can perhaps be included here because they also have to do with the human body and tend to arouse shock or disgust in us ; though mostly they affect anatomy rather than physiology and sometimes have little or no magical motivation . At any rate , they constitute a set of folkways allied to the class we are considering . It is true that our fashions have developed strange I28 MORE ABOUT PROGRESS 30I coiffures , cosmetics , corsets , and such , but they lack the element of permanent bodily defacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem infantile both in their unabashed preoccupation with bodily functions and in their disregard of other human lives as compared with the gratifications of the ego . In this sense , advanced cultures may be described as psychologically more adult . Hence their unwillingness to interest themselves in personal physiology , but their concern about humaneness . The latter is manifest also in trends like those of opposition to slavery , torture as a judicial procedure , beatings as legal punishment , execution with torture , slaughter of prisoners of war . While , apart from deformatory practices , the primitive folkways enumerated almost always have ritual approval or supernaturalistic association , it is equally significant that the advanced " universal " or world religions , Buddhism and Mohammedanism as well as Christianity , have consistently and positively thrown their weight on the prohumane and anti-infantile side . In other words , what primitive religion approves or enjoins in this field , civilized religion forbids . This suggests that the role of religion is secondary in these matters : it tends to fortify such standards of decency , humanity , cleanliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly attained . It sanctions the mores more than it causes them . The present class of criteria of progress , then , consisting of adult attitudes toward physiological function , in which the magical and supernatural elements appear to be only indirectly contributory , accordingly differs from the class discussed in the last section , in which the animistic and surrealistic element is basic and essential . Of course , we are dealing here with exceedingly broad trends or drifts , which can not be uniform in particulars . Retarded cultures form an enormous class , advanced ones another , and there is bound to be a deal of variation in each . For instance , the Eskimo , as nonliterate , nonmetallurgical hunters , are always reckoned as primitives . In fact it was long fashionable to begin the scale of civilization with Australians , Bushmen , Negritos , and Eskimo at the lower end . Yet the Eskimo do not possess in very emphatic form any custom of the class now being discussed , and lack some of them altogether . Judged by this criterion alone , Eskimo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some high civilizations  --  possibly that of much of India . In short , what we are dealing with is not a handy yardstick , but a probability tendency that holds good on the whole or in the long run . Among the North American Indians , the Western ones were particularly Chinese foot-binding seems to be the only case of serious mutilation practiced in a great recent civilization . Ear-piercing and circumcision are after all anatomically negligible . Foot-binding is rather a special phenomenon . It is consciously erotic with a tingeing of the perverse to the point of making overt discussion of its motivation taboo ; and its disabling effect limited the practice to certain economic classes .
