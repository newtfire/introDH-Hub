" I am no swindler , only a poet , " pleaded the handsome would-be lawyer Faustino Valentin . Citizens of Valencia , jamming the lofty , oak-paneled courtroom where he was standing trial , applauded lustily , for the swindles that Faustino had perpetrated were just such poems as all their dreams were made of . For 15 days last year , he had convinced them all-and many a harder head into the bargain-that a certain penniless foundling named Maria del Rosario was in reality a marquesa possessed of vast lands and riches . A local bank had cheerfully advanced money to Maria to clothe her new dignity . Maria had established herself and her foster parents in a new home to await delivery of her lands and castles . All Valencia reveled in her good fortune ( TIME , Sept. 24 ) until the bubble burst . It was all a fake , dreamed up by young Faustino , a onetime law student who had flunked out . <P> " I wish the code had a stiffer penalty for those taking advantage of poor people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool out of a poor , honest working girl . " The presiding judge agreed . Last week he sentenced Valentin to four years and three months in prison , plus an indemnity of 20,000 pesetas to be paid to Maria . But the 27-year-old ex-marquesa , who had taken time off from her job as a charwoman to testify , bore no grudge . Her work-reddened hands hidden in the folds of a rich , black silk dress , the one remnant of her marquesal wardrobe , she told the court : " Of course , he lied . But it could have been true . . . And for 15 days I was happier than I 've ever dreamed of being . I am grateful to him . " <P> Faustino bowed low . " Gracias , Marquesita , " he said .
