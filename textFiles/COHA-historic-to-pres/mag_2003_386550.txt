For nearly a century , the nation 's 15 million Shiite Muslims have been denied access to political power . How their demands are met in the months to come could well determine Iraq 's future <p> KARBALA , 60 miles southwest of Baghdad , is usually no more than a 90-minute drive through an increasingly green landscape of date palms , eucalyptus trees and reeds watered by the nearby Euphrates . But for most of a week this past October , the journey turned into a five-hour crawl . Highways leading to Karbala were choked by an enormous mass of humanity heading toward the city to celebrate the birth of the 12th Imam , a redeemer born more than a thousand years ago who disappeared as a child and , so these travelers believe , will one day return to overthrow all tyrants . Many walked all the way from Baghdad  --  crowds had been streaming out of the city since midweek  --  while others had set out days earlier from towns as far away as Nasiriyah , in the deep south , and Kirkuk , 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , the pilgrims , many of them barefoot , kept up an urgent pace . The flags they carried  --  mostly bright green , but also red , yellow , pink  --  made brilliant splashes of color in the flat landscape , contrasting with the all-enveloping black abayas of the women . They marched in separate groups , parties of friends or neighbors , until they drew close to their destination and coalesced into one dense column . Every so often a group would break into a rhythmic chant , invoking the names of the martyr-saints that inspire their faith . " We are Shia , " the-men roared in unison , stabbing their fists in the air . " We are the sons of Imam Hussein , and the name of Ali is always on our tongues . " <p> Shiites or Shia  --  the terms are used interchangeably and both mean " partisans "  --  form one of the two great branches of Islam . About 150 million Shiites are spread around the world , most of them in Iran , Iraq , India and Pakistan . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global Muslim population of more than a billion , Shiites form the majority in Iraq  --  as many as 15 million out of a population of 24 million . Nonetheless , Shiites have never held power in Iraq nor fully participated in its government , and at times have been brutally repressed . <p> The future role of the Shiites is one of the most important issues facing Iraq . Now that their greatest oppressor , Saddam Hussein , is gone , they will no longer tolerate second-class status . At the same time , others in Iraq and elsewhere , including many in the United States , fear that a Shiite-dominated government might impose an Iranian-style fundamentalist Islamic regime . If a democratic Iraq is to emerge from the ruins bequeathed by Saddam Hussein , both the hopes of the Shiites and the fears of non-Shiites will somehow have to be accommodated . <p> Iraqi Shiites are a diverse group . Some are educated and middle class , but most are poor Arabs living in rural southern Iraq or Baghdad 's slums ( there are significant communities among the non-Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They range from the deeply religious to the wholly secular . Their common bond is a memory of discrimination , whether in the form of the mass executions common during the reign of Saddam Hussein or simply in their exclusion from power throughout Iraq 's history . <p> Today , the Shiites are confident that those days ended with the fall of Saddam Hussein . " Everything is changing , " Adil Abdul Mehdi , a leader of a powerful Shiite party , told me cheerfully in Baghdad , as we sped across town in a convoy of SUVs , surrounded by armed bodyguards . " For too long the Shia have been a majority that acted like a minority . They have to raise their heads . They have a right to represent Iraq . " <p> Now , on the road to Karbala , I was watching the Shiites assert one of those rights : the freedom to celebrate one of their great religious festivals . Fifteenth Shaban , as the festival is called , is the date in the Muslim calendar ( October 11 this year ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening of the festival , well over a million people were crowded onto the vast plaza surrounding the two colossal shrines crowned with golden domes and minarets that dominate the center of the city . <p> Karbala is a holy place for Shiites because of the two men buried in those shrines . Half brothers , they died in a battle here long ago , a battle that grew out of a ferocious struggle to lead Islam after the death of the prophet Muhammad in A.D. 632 . The Shiite faith originated with those Muslims who thought that the wrong side-that led by Abu Bakr , father-in-law of the prophet Muhammad  --  won , unjustly usurping Muhammad 's cousin and son-in-law , Ali . ( Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr was the rightful heir . ) Ali did finally become caliph in 656 but was assassinated five years later and buried in nearby Najaf . Shiites regard Ali 's brief reign as the last period of legitimate and just rule on earth . <p> Nineteen years after Ali 's death , his second son , Hussein , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from the people of Kufa , then chafing under the harsh rule of a Sunni caliph , Yazid , and set out across the desert to lead them in rebellion . It is a fundamental tenet of Shiism that Hussein 's motivation was not power lust but revulsion at Yazid 's tyrannical rule . As one cleric in a theological school in Najaf assured me , " When Imam Hussein left Medina , he said , ' I 'm not going to win a fortune or a throne . I am going out for justice , ' even though he knew he was going to be sacrificed . " Indeed , many believe that Hussein knew before he left Medina that his supporters had been rounded up and that his cause was doomed . <p> Intercepted by the caliph 's army on the plain of Karbala after a long journey across the desert , Hussein and his band of 72 family members and followers refused to surrender , digging a ditch behind them to preclude retreat . The saga cherished by Iraqi Shiites recounts how , in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and children crying from thirst . Fighting his way to a nearby stream to fetch water , he was cut down . Hussein , fighting on a few hundred yards away , was the last to die , sword in one hand , Koran in the other . <p> This religious schism between Sunnis and Shiites is not , however , mutually antagonistic in the manner of Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland or Christians and Muslims in Beirut . " My mother is Sunni , my father Shia , " says Baghdad native Fareer Yassin . " One third of the Muslims in my high-school graduating class were from mixed Sunni Shia marriages , and that was typical of Baghdad . " I have heard similar stories from many Iraqis , who also point out that direct clashes between the two communities are extremely rare and that discrimination against the Shiites has inevitably been orchestrated by rulers  --  whether kings or Saddam Hussein  --  for political , not religious reasons . <p> FOR THE MASSES of faithful pouring into Karbala for the festival this past October , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strolling late in the warm evening through the vast crowd around the shrines of Hussein and Abbas , I heard constant reaffirmations of support for the long dead heroes . " See the love that people have for Imam Hussein , " said my guide , Ala'a Baqir , a pharmacist influential in local affairs . " He is for justice , and people think we are losing that in our own time . We are ready to fight at any time for Imam Hussein . " <p> It would be easy to dismiss such assertions as simply the celebration of a folk myth , but the saga of the martyrs has preserved a potent philosophy at the core of the Shiite faith . " Shiites regard the opposing of injustice and tyranny and fighting against an unjust ruler as a supreme religious duty , " explained Hussain Shahristani , a nuclear scientist , devout Shiite and lifelong rebel , as we sat in the Karbala office of the humanitarian relief group he founded and directs . He cited the great national uprising of 1920 ( his father 's first cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who occupied Iraq between 1917 and 1932  --  and effectively controlled it until 1958 . Although both Shiites and Sunnis joined the revolt , Shiite religious and tribal leaders played the major role . Politically , the failed rebellion proved disastrous for the Shiites , since the British thereafter relied exclusively on the Sunni elite to govern Iraq . But , says Shahristani , Shiites " could n't do anything else . It might be politically better to just go along with the master , but for us that 's impossible . " <p> Shahristani speaks with authority on the topic of dissent . In September 1979 he told Saddam Hussein to his face that building a nuclear weapon was wrong and refused to work on the project . He was tortured and spent 11 years behind bars , 10 in solitary confinement . During the Gulf War in 1991 , he made a daring escape  --  he stole a guard 's uniform and drove out the prison 's main gate . Afterward , he declined a comfortable exile in the West in favor of organizing humanitarian aid for both Iraqi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found Shahristani 's views echoed by religious authorities , who made it clear that this obligation to resist applies even to the American-led occupation , of which the Shiites are increasingly resentful . In a modest house in the center of Karbala , Sheik Abdul Mehdi Salami , who leads the Friday prayers at the Hussein shrine ( an immensely prestigious position ) , said that " fighting injustice is the principal duty for all Shia . " " For the meantime , " he added , his people were using " peaceful means " to assert their rights from the coalition and that Shiites do not like " killing and blood . " But if they must , they will " sacrifice everything to get their rights . " <p> Compared with what they endured in Saddam Hussein 's time , the Shiites today appear to have little cause for complaint . Saddam not only had banned all public religious processions but , according to worshipers I spoke to , particularly disliked the notion of a 12th Imam who would return to overthrow tyrants . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was risking his life . Strolling with me through the crowd on the eve of the festival , Ala'a Baqir recalled how celebrants would evade Saddam 's security forces on the main roads by sneaking through fields and palm groves . " We would go out and leave food and put down little lights to guide them , " said Baqir . <p> This year , for the first time in decades , there was no need for surreptitious measures , and the plaza was alive with light and the noise of declaiming preachers and chanting marchers  --  " we are the Shia. . . "  --  against the background noise of several hundred thousand people . Above us , party balloons soared up past the golden dome of the Abbas shrine . <p> Yet even this happy atmosphere harbored ominous undercurrents . A coffin was carried around the Hussein shrine  --  a traditional Shiite rite  --  but this one contained the body of a man killed the night before in a firefight with American soldiers in Sadr City , the vast Shiite slum in northeast Baghdad . I began noticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial shrouds over their shoulders , a symbol of their willingness to die as martyrs , an attitude much favored by supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr , the 30- year-old extremist whose men had ambushed and killed two American soldiers in that firefight . <p> FOR CENTURIES , Karbala and its sister shrine city , Najaf , had been islands of Shiism , well connected to the international Shiite community but with few ties to the nomadic Bedouin tribes roaming the desert just beyond the cities ' gates . Only at the beginning of the 19th century did the clergy of Karbala and Najaf begin to convert the desert tribes , partly because they needed muscle to defend against increasing attacks by fanatical Wahhabi Sunni sweeping across the desert from what is now Saudi Arabia . <p> At the same time , Shiite clerical leaders decided that only the most learned among them should be allowed to issue fatwas , religious rulings on matters of law or common concern . These few senior figures became known as " sources of emulation . " One hot day in late September I sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one of four such living sources of emulation , the Pakistan-born Ayatollah Bashir al Najri . My classmates were turbaned , gray-whiskered elders . We sat respectfully on the floor while our revered teacher expounded at some length on the requirements of women to perform ritual ablutions . Some parts of the syllabus , I felt , had probably not changed over the centuries . <p> The Shiite religious leadership gained power and influence in the last years of Ottoman rule , just before World War I , then fell on harder times during the British occupation and the succeeding Sunni monarchy installed in 1921 . " The first Shia prime minister was appointed in 1947 , " Adil Mehdi said bitterly " That was nearly 28 years after the founding of the state . Though the Shia represented 60 percent of the population , we only ever had 20 percent of the cabinet posts . " <p> In hopes of bettering their lot in the 1950s and early ' 60s , many Shiites were drawn to radical organizations , principally the Communist Party but also the Arab nationalist Baath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a leftist revolution in 1958 , the Shiites were at last represented in the radical military government that assumed power . But that regime was overthrown in another coup five years later , and the Shiites ' brief moment in the sun came to an end . <p> Though the Baath Party had originally numbered many Shiites among its leaders , by the time it began its 35-year rule with a coup in 1968 , the leadership was solidly in the hands of a tight group of Sunni tribesmen , including a ruthless hit man named Saddam Hussein , from the region around Tikrit . Apart from hunting down and killing their former Communist rivals , Saddam and his militantly secular colleagues also took aim at the Shiite religious leadership . <p> In response to the wholesale defection of many of their flock to the Communists , the Shiite religious leadership made efforts to modernize their message and attract new followers . Prominent among them was a brilliant scholar named Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr , the principal sponsor of Dawa , a radical Islamic political party that confronted the Baathists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensified after Ayatollah Khomeini , himself a Shiite who had spent most of the 1960s and ' 70s in Najaf developing his theory that clergy had the exclusive right to govern , seized power in Iran in 1979 . Sadr , thrilled by Iran 's mass Islamic uprising against the shah , thought a similar religious takeover of the government was possible in Iraq . Saddam , apparently worried that Sadr might be right , launched a campaign to round up his supporters . In April 1980 , Sadr and his sister were arrested and executed . <p> Shahristani , the nuclear scientist and prison escapee , was close to Sadr . He told me that at the end , the Baathists offered Sadr a deal . " They said they would release him in exchange for a promise of silence . Sadr said , ' No . I have closed all the doors , there is no escape for you . Now you have to kill me so the people can rise up . ' " As any Shiite would immediately understand , it was an embrace of martyrdom that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Sadr 's hopes and Saddam 's fears proved groundless . The people did not rise up , and in the eight-year war that followed Saddam 's invasion of Iran in September 1980 , Shiite conscripts for the most part fought doggedly for Iraq , largely motivated , despite their grievances and persecution , by Iraqi patriotism . <p> But after the 1991 Gulf War , inspired by calls for an uprising from Washington , Shiites finally erupted in furious rebellion . That the expected U.S. assistance never came has hardly been forgotten . <p> Nobody knows how many people were killed in Saddam 's savage reprisals for the uprising , but the number is at least in the tens of thousands . One mass grave of those slaughtered has alone yielded more than 3,000 bodies , and hundreds of such graves have been unearthed . Ironically , the Baathist 's savagery helped unify the diverse Shiite community . In the 1990s , even while cracking down viciously on Shiite religious leadership , Saddam made attempts to bolster his support among religious conservatives by encouraging such Islamic practices as the veiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the prohibition of alcohol . ( Gestures to appease Shiites included repairs to shrines and a manufactured family tree tracing Saddam 's ancestry back to Ali . ) But while the measures helped revive traditions , they produced no corresponding support for the dictator . <p> Toward the end of the decade , Shiites found a leader in the person of Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr , a teacher from Najaf and a distant relative of the resistance leader executed in 1980 . Initially encouraged by the regime because of his denunciations of the United States , Sadr II , as he is often called , set up a network of followers across southern Iraq and in Baghdad . Late in 1998 , though , he began wearing the white martyr 's shroud while denouncing Saddam 's regime to growing and enthusiastic crowds . In February 1999 , while driving home in Najaf , Sadr , along with two of his sons , was duly machine-gunned to death by state security agents . <p> Today , portraits of Sadr II , who is invariably depicted as a humble ancient with a snow-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently share space with bearded , turbaned portraits of other Shiite leaders , many of them dead  --  testimony to the high mortality rate in Shiite religious politics . A few hundred yards from the site of the al-Sadr murder , for example , is a green-domed tomb , still under construction , that contains what few remains could be collected of the late Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al Hakim , founder and leader of a political party called the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq . He was the victim of a massive car bomb that exploded as he was leaving Najaf 's Imam Ali shrine on August 29 this year . <p> Hakim was almost certainly killed by former members of Saddam 's security services now active in the resistance and determined to eliminate anyone , like Hakim , who cooperated with the Americans . However , at the funeral ceremonies , attended by hundreds of thousands of Hakim 's followers , Abdel-Aziz al-Hakim , his brother and successor as leader of the party , bitterly denounced the occupation forces for their failure to protect Hakim . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticize their new rulers . <p> I viewed the massive destruction caused by the Hakim bomb during a trip to the shrine to see where a man I once knew had also been murdered . Last April , Abdul Majid al-Khoei , the son of a grand ayatollah , had just returned to Najaf  --  with the blessing of coalition forces , who appreciated his energy and liberal views  --  after 12 years of exile in London . Just inside the courtyard of the Ali shrine , a mob attacked him . Two companions were stabbed to death , but Khoei managed to escape and run the 50 or so yards that brought him to the front door of a house belonging to Muqtada al Sadr , the radical Shiite extremist , who is a son of the martyred Sadr II . Khoei pleaded for shelter , but although there is little doubt that Muqtada was inside , the door did not open . A shopkeeper finally took Khoei in , but the mob followed , dragged him down the street and round the corner , and knifed him to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the killing , though no one in Najaf that I talked to doubts his responsibility Khoei not only believed in cooperation with the occupation but also stood for the separation of church and state , as opposed to the Iranian system of clerical rule , which Muqtada has endorsed . <p> On the day I retraced Khoei 's desperate flight , Muqtada 's well-guarded door was open and his front room crowded with petitioners seeking his help or advice . Three clerics sat at a table collecting wads of bank notes contributed by the faithful . Six months after the invasion that toppled his father 's killer , Muqtada was embroiled in an escalating conflict with the coalition forces and seemed to welcome any opportunity to confront them or , for that matter , other Shiite groups . Muqtada certainly enjoys a large amount of support among the poorer Shiites , most particularly among young unemployed men in the great Shiite slum of Sadr City in Baghdad . In the week following the peaceful 15th Shaban celebrations in Karbala , Muqtada 's gunmen attempted to take over the Hussein shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left several dead and wounded on both sides . A few days later , they fought a U.S. patrol near the shrine , killing three Americans . ( There were reports of a U.S. crackdown on Muqtada as we went to press . ) <p> Opposing Muqtada in Karbala had been a shrine protection force loyal to perhaps the most important and revered Shiite leader in Iraq , Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani . Sistani , 73 , was born in Iran but moved to Najaf more than 50 years ago to study He spent much of the 1990s under the baleful surveillance of Saddam 's security forces . Yet from his house , he maintained an extraordinary moral authority over the Shiite masses . When , in mid-April , there was an erroneous radio report that Sistani 's house was under siege by followers of Muqtada al-Sadr , the news spread like wildfire . " I was sleeping in a village near Basra that night , " recalls Hussain Shahristani . " Suddenly I saw the villagers grabbing their guns and preparing to rush to Najaf , hundreds of miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was all they needed to know . The same thing happened all over Iraq . " <p> Though he has denounced violence and the proliferation of firearms in Iraq , Sistani himself has command of a far more potent weapon  --  the immense authority of his fatwas . Last July he addressed the fundamental question of how he wanted the constitution for Iraq to be written . The occupation authorities had endorsed a plan by which their handpicked governing council would appoint a committee that would in turn devise the new constitution . In a fatwa written in graceful classical Arabic , Sistani declared that this approach was " unacceptable " because there was no guarantee that a constitution produced in this way would " represent the ( Iraqi ) National identity of which Islam and the noble values of society are an integral part . " ( Sistani has always rejected Khomeini 's thesis on direct clerical rule . ) Instead , he insisted , anyone writing a constitution would have to be elected . A constitution devised by any other means , he made clear , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Paul Bremer , the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , sent a message to the venerable religious leader suggesting that the two men cooperate on the constitution , Sistani sent a message back : " Mr. Bremer , you are an American and I am an Iranian . I suggest we leave it up to the Iraqis to devise their constitution . " <p> Few in Iraq believe that a constitution denounced by Sistani would stand a chance . But any fair election would almost certainly deliver a Shiite-dominated constitutional assembly The underdogs and rebels would at last be in power  --  a sea change for a group that has so long defined itself through resistance to oppression . Will the Shiites still celebrate martyrdom when they are , themselves , in power ? And who will judge them if they prove unjust ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : For the first time in decades , Iraq 's 15 million Shiites are able to gather en masse ( at the Imam Hussein shrine in Karbala in April ) .
