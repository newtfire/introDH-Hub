Everyone when I was growing up had a dog or a brother or a cousin , someone close by , called Buddy . The Buddy in my life had been christened Samuel Schubert Eastman in 1946 . Certainly he deserved a dignified name , and yet we boys knew that for everyday use " Samuel " was too grave for a person like Buddy . Our cousin , as heroes must be , was the specimen among us . He was graced with sandy hair , green eyes , a dusting of freckles on his sunburnt nose , and thick gold lashes that matted in triangles against his cheeks after swimming . My mother used to say that his delicate features and those starlet eyelashes in his athlete 's body were what confused the girls , the poor things sure he was tender . When he was fourteen , he told me part of what he guessed was a family secret , drawing me in one night with that piece of overrated information , the cheap start , the chocolate with a boozy liquid center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of secrets in the repertory , very few of them worth disclosing , most of them good only for the quick thrill of stopping the pulse : suddenly you are not who you think you are . Despite his revelation and his alarming suggestion , it was even then his use of the word " secret " that seemed most vulgar . We weresitting on the end of the dock at Moose Lake in northern Wisconsin . The house far up on the hill was not an ordinary Moose Lake cottage , the usual clapboard structure with uneven floorboards and a screened-in porch . No , the Maciver family house was made of granite and oak , walnut , copper , and English brick , a fortress with seven fireplaces and fifteen bedrooms , each with a sink scrubbed clean in the corner . Five of the rooms had their own sleeping porches , with faded cotton hammocks from Barbados strung across , the place the girls napped on the hot afternoons . There was also an icehouse , a pump house , a summer kitchen , a boathouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estate , which , we were called to remember , was the fruit of our dead grandfather 's labor . That he was related to us seemed implausible-a man who had grown rich manufacturing glue ? He had shot a buffalo on the range , the rug in the parlor as proof , but also with that nimble trigger finger he 'd mounted and labeled and framed his butterfly collection . We loved to look at the petticoat wings and the sad balding thoraxes , the part that embarrassed us . Our forebear , the captain of industry , the great hunter , the lover of beauty , had been clever enough not to lose all of his fortune in the Depression , had made it possible for us boys of the glue dynasty to spend our days under our grandmother 's direction in the boot camp of summer idleness . On her schedule we swam , we played tennis , we fished , and we chopped wood . Buddy mentioned the putative family scandal to me one night , after we 'd finally been released from the evening game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother 's Sapphira and the Slave Girl . He and I were sitting on the rough wood slats of the dock , as we often did , moving our feet through the water , Buddy reviewing what had just happened or telling me what we might accomplish next . As if the idea were just occurring to him he said , " Hey ! You know Madeline , pretty Madeline ! " He was singing her name . " You could feel her up and it 's not like you 'd be a pervert . And if you knocked her up-say you knocked her up-she 'd have a drooling mongrel that looked like you , but there 's no way it would be a real half-breed . " When I did n't answer , he nudged me with his elbow . " What 's the matter ? You mean you do n't know about your " - here he drew out the word , hissing in my face- " sister ? She 's fair game , Brains , that 's what I 'm telling you . Everyone should be that lucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew about mating , my father 's word , and I had the vaguest sense from dreams that my tallywhacker , as my mother fondly called the part-although it was unruly and had unreasonable hopes-might even so be a source of pride to me someday . In my waking hours it scared me to think of that someday , and I could n't in much detail imagine how another person could participate in my privacy . The mechanics , then , the logistics of feeling a girl up , were impossible : not only how and of course where , exactly , but why ? " Madeline 's not related to any of us ! " Buddy cried , cuffing my shoulder . " The big secret , pal . " " I know it , " I lied . She 'd probably really appreciate the , uh , attention . " He laughed into his chest , my worldly cousin enjoying his own joke . I suspect that my parents had told me about Madeline in some fashion when I was little , so that I 'd always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood relative . But she behaved as sisters do , and my parents treated her as one of us , and because she was perennially young I never thought of her as anything but sister . My parents were raising Louise and me , and always Madeline , educating us according to our abilities to be thoughtful , useful , and loving , keepers of the New Deal . Later that night , in the boathouse , where all the boys slept , I lay awake brooding over what Buddy had told me . There was no electricity in the building , nor were there lights around the lake . The rough pine walls were dirty from decades of kerosene smoke , and the sheets that had once been white were dull from our heat and sweat . The darkness was complete . I had a hazy understanding that Madeline was some kind of relation-exactly how eluded me-who had been injured as a young woman . I was horrified even starting to think about her , against my will , in the way Buddy had directed . Everyone else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go outside I felt that I should n't get up or move around . My stomach began to ache , as it often did when I was with Buddy for long . I could never repeat what he 'd said , not to anyone , and most of all not to my parents . For the first time I wondered if they had to worry about Madeline , if she was ever in danger from the neighborhood teenagers , some of them nearly as adult as Buddy . My cousin surely would n't have hurt Madeline , and by " hurt " I meant kissing . But the way he had laughed into his shirt made me consider and reject and wonder again if he might have done something to my sister . Madeline was in fact my father 's age , forty-one that year . If Buddy had told me right off that Madeline had once been my father 's wife , what would I have said or done , sitting on the pier , my legs in the water ? Would I have laughed out loud ? Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making sure to get him all wet ? Maybe I 'd have argued , saying that a person who was n't capable of doing logic puzzles past a second-grade level could hardly have been a wife . Or , as Buddy spoke , would my heart have abruptly begun to beat in my chest , hard , loud thumps-that overburdened muscle always the organ that registers the truth ? I suppose it 's odd that for the length of my childhood Madeline never looked any different to me . I 'd heard it said by the women on our block that she was a beauty- " a real Princess Grace , " one of them called her . Despite Madeline 's height and her regal charms , I always thought of her as a girl , first someone who was my older sister and then , forever after , when I 'd bypassed her intellectually , as my youngest sister . She was long-legged and slim , with a silky blond ponytail , each day a fresh ribbon , a new color around the rubber band . Every other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed under the Lady Vanity hair dryer , imperial in the shower-cap device , the diadem that was puffy from the hot air blowing through a fat cord . She did have a high forehead and notable cheekbones , and , by rights as a princess , a rosy mouth that puckered so prettily into a pout , what could be the precursor to a squall . She was a firm believer in outfits , so that if she was dressed in an ensemble as simple as a pair of **28;1108;TOOLONG pedal pushers and a sleeveless yellow shirt , her socks were bound to be just that yellow , and her tennis shoes , somehow , miraculously , were exactly the turquoise of her slacks . Twice a year my mother took her to a charity resale store , where Madeline , in a fever of excitement , updated her wardrobe . She was a girl who laid tops and bottoms on the rug before she went to sleep , and who insisted that Russia , the cleaning lady , iron her play clothes . I say she seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own kind-Madeline , the only one of us outside of time . I was old enough to understand the strange , mournful noise that came from her lonely bedroom , the sound of adult pleasure a person was supposed to stifle . I did n't want to think about any of it as I lay awake at Moose Lake . Somewhere in the middle of the night I realized that what was disturbing me most had nothing to do with my own family . I sat up suddenly , fumbled around on my windowsill , and struck a match . Madeline , my father , my mother , and even Louise and I-our lives were not to be made into stories for Buddy to tell . I lit the candle in order to look at him , unafraid then of waking anyone . His full , smooth lips were open against his pillow , his freckled back rising and falling . Before me was the boy who had the rest of his unending life to be the Maciver bard , to alter our history to suit himself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as sour as any of the other boys ' familiar stink . Of course I had smelled him every summer , smelled his particular sweat mixed with the faint tang of Old Spice , but I had n't realized that I did n't like it . I was unaccustomed to feeling insubordination with Buddy , and yet I was sure that in a minute I would effortlessly tip the flame to his soft , worn sheet and set him on fire . Chapter Two Buddy and I did n't discuss Madeline after that night at the lake-not because he 'd expired in a plume of flames before my eyes , but because the topic did n't present itself again . We went on during the vacation as if the conversation had n't taken place , or as if I had gladly soaked up the scant communication and had no further questions . He used to jump me from behind , always a big joke , and we 'd tumble down the hill wrestling . As I remember , right after the revelation I did resist him with more force than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to do . Still , it would never have crossed his mind that because of our talk it was he I might think of in a different light , rather than Madeline . She was not after all a girl you could consider for very long , weighing this part of her personality against that part . You spent your time with her fighting boredom , the way you would if you were told to watch little children . Even though in Buddy 's character there was more range , although he was not simple , surely he would have had no idea that anyone might lose admiration for him . That summer he introduced me to alcohol , and under the influence of the small amount of beer he was able to pilfer , we gambled with nickels instead of pennies . Our bad behavior is quaint now , adorable even , but at the time I thought we were in the most serious danger ; I was certain that the discovery and our punishment would be so shaming , our characters so besmirched , that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods in the dark , the one bottle going straight to my head , and afterward we 'd stumble into the boathouse for cards with the younger boys . It stood to reason , then , that Buddy should have retained his luster . He instructed us as a group about " women , " he called them , always pursing his lips as if he were whistling right before the " wo , " and smiling hard on the " n , " humming the final sound , in case the importance of the word should escape our notice . Our goal , he told us , was to get the goods from women with the least amount of trouble . His advice by and large ran toward pacification as the means to maintaining the upper hand , a general principle beyond our reach . " Say you 've snagged yourself a woman , " he 'd say , taking his time to arrange his cards . " Once you 've got her , you want to make sure you tell her she 's foxy , a doll face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ? You flirt with other women just enough to keep her on edge . You act like you 're listening to the whining , you keep your peepers on her , you wrinkle your eyebrows . " He demonstrated , head cocked , skin creased , the paragon of attention . " Why do you do this , boys ? " He could n't really expect us to know the answer , could he ? We all looked at the floor . " Why ? " he asked again . Cousin Nick coughed , and Petie accidentally dropped the rock he 'd been holding . " Because , " Buddy finally said , " you are concerned . " We nodded solemnly , hopeful that when our moment with a female came we could do exactly as he said . Although he had the sense that beer was too adult for the others , he had us all smoking cigarettes . " Let me tell you something " - he 'd take a drag no-handed as he slapped his cards down , the cigarette lifting when he drew in , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip as he exhaled . " Getting pussy , it 's like buying a car . You make your offer , right ? The salesman counters , you make another offer , the salesman comes back with a bum deal . " He surveyed the circle . " What do you do ? " Again , that quiet . " Do you take it ? " " What 's pussy ? " said Cousin Petie , who had only recently been allowed to sleep with the big boys . We laughed , most of us with the heartiness of discomfort , unsure ourselves of the details . " You do not take the deal , you hear me ? You hit the trail . Nine times out of ten , the hustler is at your heels , begging for your business . " Not long ago , I remembered that simile of Buddy 's with my cousin Nick . We both recalled being confused enough to wonder which a person should do first , buy a car in order to get a girl , or get the girl so that purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy 's ease , the confidence in his delivery . " What you 've got to realize , gentlemen , " Buddy would say , " is that every single cupcake-unless she 's a twatless freak of nature-has a pussy . Do n't forget that . You fall for a certain broad , you start thinking she 's the only one to get you all dick-brained . That happens , you might as well kiss yourself goodbye . " He 'd had real experience and he 'd taken the time to consider his encounters . We knew his wisdom was hard-earned . ( Continues ... )
