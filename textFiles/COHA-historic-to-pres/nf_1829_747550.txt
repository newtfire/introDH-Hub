once said to her , ** I hope , my daughter , you will one day be satisfied with rambling . " An eager thirst for knowledge is commonly the attendant , and often the parent , of a restless , enterprising disposition . It was so in the case of Mrs. Judson . She loved learning , and a book could allure her from her favorite walks , and from the gayest social circle . The desire for knowledge is often found in connection with moderate intellectual faculties ; anri in such cases , with favorable opportunities , the individual may make a respectable pro- /z/ ficiency in learning . But this desire is almost invariably an attribute of eminent mental powers : and the person thus happily endowed , needs nothing but industry and adequate means , to ensure the attainment of the highest degree of literary excellence . Mrs. Judson 's mind was of a superior order . It was distinguished by strength , activity , and clearness . She has , indeed , left no memorials , which can be produced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wrote much , but her writings have perished , except letters and accounts of missionary proceedings , written without any design to exhibit her abilities , or display her learning , ut no one can review her life , and read what she has written and published , without feeling that her mind possessed unusual vigor and cultivation . She was educated at the Academy in Bradford , a seminary which has become hallowed by her memory , and by that of Mrs. Newell , the proto-martyr of the American Missions . Here she pursued her studies with much success . Her perceptions were rapid , her memory retentive , and her perseverance indefatigable . Here she laid the foundations of her knowledge , and here her intellect was stimulated , disciplined and directed . Her preceptors and associates ever regarded her with respect and esteem ; and considered her ardent temperament , her decision and perseverance , and her strength of mind , as ominous of some uncommon destiny . Her religious character , however , is of the most importance , in itself , and in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the deepest concern , to trace the rise and progress of that spiritual renovation , and that divine teaching , which made he ; a disciple of the Saviour , and prepared her for her labors in his service . Of this momentous change , the following account , written by herself , has happily been rescued from the fate which befel the greater part of her private journals :  --  " During the first sixteen years of my life , I very seldom felt any serious impressions , which I think were produced by the Holy Spirit . I was early taught by my mother ( though she wvls then ignorant of the nature of true religion ) the importance of abstaining from those vices , to which children are liable  --  as telling falsehoods , disobeying my parents , taking what was not my own , &;  --  c . She also taught me , that if 1 were a good child , I should , at death , escape that dreadful hell , the thought of which some*. /q/ times filled me with alarm and terror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the above-mentioned sins , to say my prayers night and morning , and to abstain from my usual play on the Sabbath , not doubting , but that such a course of conduct would ensure my salvation . " At the age of twelve or thirteen , I attended the academy at Bradford , where I was exposed to many more temptations than before , and found it much more difficult to pursue my Pharisaical method . I now began to attend balls , and parties of pleasure , and found my mind completely occupied with what 1 daily heard were " innocent amusements . " My conscience reproved me , not for engaging in these amusements , but for neglecting to say my prayers , and read my Bible , on returning from them ; but I finally put a stop to its remonstrances , by thinking , that , as I was old enough to attend balls , f was surely too old to say prayers . Thus were my fears quieted ; and for two or three years , I scarcely felt an anxious thought relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly verging towards eternal ruin . My disposition was gay in the extreme ; my situation was such as afforded me opportunities for indulging it to the utmost ; 1 was surrounded with associates , wild and volatile like myself , and often thought myself one of the happiest creatures on earth . " The first circumstance , which in any measure awakened me from this sleep of death , was the following . One Sabbath morning , having prepared myself to attend public worship , just as I was leaving my toilet , I accidentally took up Hannah More 's Strictures on Female Education ; and the first words that caught my eye were , She that liveth in pleasure y is dead while she liveth . They were written in italics , with marks of admiration ; and they struck me to the heart . I stood for a few moments , amazed at the incident , and half inclined to think , that some invisible agency had directed my eye to those words . At first , I thought I would live a different life , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the words were not so applicable to me , as I firsT imagined , and resolved to think no more of them . " In the course of a few months ( at the age of fifteen , ) I met with Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress . 1 read it as a Sabbath book , and was much interested in the story . I finished the book on a Sabbath , and it left this impression on my mind  --  that Christian , because he adhered to the nar- /z/ // row path , was carried safely through all his trials , and at last admitted into heaven . I resolved , from that moment , to begin a religious life ; and in order to keep my resolor tions , I went to my chamber and prayed for divine assistance . When I had done , I felt pleased with myself , and thought I was in a fair way for heaven . But I was perplexed to know what it was to live a religious life , and again had recourse to my system of works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take , was , to refrain from attending parties of pleasure , and be reserved and serious in the presence of the other scholars . Accordingly , on Monday morning , I went to school , with a determination to keep my resolution , and confident that I should . 1 had not been long in school , before one of the young ladies , an intimate friend of mine , came with a very animated coujitenance , and told me that Miss in a neighboring town , was to have a splendid party on new year 's day , and that she and I were included in the party selected . I coolly replied , that I should not go , though I did receive an invitation . She seemed surprised , and asked me what was the matter . I replied , that I should never again attend such a party . I continued of the same opinion during the day , and felt much pleased with such a good opportunity of trying myself . Monday evening , the daughters of sent in to invite me and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family visit . I hesitated a little , but considering that it was to be a fiunily party merely , I thought I could go without breaking my resolutions . Accordingly I went , and found that two or three other families of young ladies had been invited . Dancing was soon introduced ; my religious plans were forgotten ' - 1 joined with the rest  --  was one of the gayest of the gay  --  and thought no more of the new life I had just begun . On my return home , I found an invitation from Miss ' in waiting , and accepted it at once . My conscience let rae pass quietly through the amusements of that evening also ; but when I retired to my chamber , on my return , it accused me of breaking my most solemn resolutions . I thought I should never dare to make others , for I clearly saw , that I was unable to keep them . ' * From December , 1805 , to April , 1806 , 1 scarcely nt a rational hour . My studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occijied in preparing my dress , and in contriving amusements for the evening , which portion of my time was wholly spent in vanity and trifling . I so MEMOI &; OF MRS . JfPSON. 1 far surpassed my friends in gaiety and mirth , that some of them were apprehensive that I had but a short time to con* tinue in my career of folly , and should be suddenly cut off . Thus passed the last winter of my gay life . ** In the spring of 1806 , there appeared a little attention to religion , in the upper parish of Bradford . Religious conferences had been appointed during the winter , and I now began to attend them regularly . I often used to weep , when hearing the minister , and others , press the importance of improving the present favorable season , to obtain an interest in Christ , lest we should have to say . The harvest is the summer is ended , and we are not saoed . I thought I should be one of that number ; for though I now deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me impossible 1 could be so , while in the midst of my gay associates . I generally sought some retired corner of the room , in which the meetings were held , lest others should observe the emotions I could not restrain ; but fiequently after being much affected through the evening , 1 would return home , in company with some of my light companions , and assume an air of gaiety very iRreign to my heart . The Spirit of God was now evidently operating on my mind ; I lost all relish for amusements ; felt melancholy and dejected ; and the solemn truth , that I must obtain a new heart , or perish forever , lay with weight on my mind . My preceptor was a pious man , and used frequently to make serious remarks in the family . One Sabbath evening , speaking of the operations of the Holy Spirit on the hearts of sinners , a subject with which I had been hitherto unacquainted , he observed , that when under these operations , Satan frequently tempted us to conceal our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could hear him say no more ; but rose from my seat , and went into the garden , that 1 might weep in secret over my deplorable state . I felt , that I was led captive by Satan at his will , and that he had entire control over me . And notwithstanding 1 knew this to be my situation , I thought I would not have any of my acquaintance know that I was under serious impressions , for the whole world . The ensuing week , I had engaged to be one of a party to visit a young lady in a neighboring town , who had formerly attended the academy . The state of my mind was such that I earnestly longed to be free from this engagement , but knew not how to gain my end , without telling the real reason . This I could not persuade myself /z/ to do ; but concluded on the morning of the appointed da j , to absent myself from my father 's home , and visit an aunt , who ived at some distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious impressions . I went accordingly , and found my aunt engaged in reading a religious magazine . I was determined she should not know the state of my mind , though I secretly hoped , that she would tell me something ' of hers . I had not been with her long , before she asked me to read to her . I began , but could not govern my feelings , and burst into tears . She kindly begged to know what thus affected me . I then , for the first time in my life , communicated feelings which I had determined should be known to none but myself . She urged the importance of my cherishing those feelings , and of devoting myself entirely to seeking an interest in Christ , before it should be forever too late . She told me , that if I trifled with impreslions which were evidently made by the Holy Spirit , I flhould be led to hardness of heart , and blindness of mind . Her words penetrated my heart , and I felt resolved to give up every thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , which I had ever felt , that others would know that I was serious , now vanished away , and I was willing that the whole universe should know , that I felt myself to be a lost and perishing sinner . I returned home , with a bursting heart , fearing that I should lose my impressions , when associated with the other scholars , and convinced that if I did , my soul was lost . As I entered my father 's house , 1 perceived a large party of the scholars assembled . to spend the evening . It , will be the height of rudeness , thought I to leave the company ; but my second thought was , if 1 lose my soul , I lose my all . I spoke to one or two , passed through the room , and went to my chamber , where I spent the evening , full of anxiety and distress . I felt that if I died in that situation , I must perish ; but how to extricate ipyself I knew not . 1 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the habit of reading religious books ; I could not understand the Bible ; and felt myself as perfectly ignorant of the nature of true religion as the very heathen . In this extremity , the next morning , I ventured to ask the preceptor what I should do . He told me to pray for mercy , and submit myself to God . He also put into my hands some religious magazines , in which I read the conviction and conversion of some , who , I perceived , had once felt as I now felt . I shut myself up in /q/ my chamber , denied myself every innocent gratification ; such as eating fruit and other things , not absolutely necessary to support life , and spent my days in reading and cry* ing for mercy . * But I had seen , as yet , very little of the awful wiclt* edness of my heart . I knew not yet the force of thai passage , The carnal mind is enmitf against God , I thought myself very penitent , and almost prepared , by voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three weeks in this manner , without obtaining the least comfort , my heart began to rise in rebellion against God . I thought it unjust in him , not to notice my prayers and my repentance . I could not endure the thought , that he was a sovereign God , and had a right to call one and leave another to perish . So far from being merciful in calling some , I thought it cruel in him to send any of his creatures to hell for their disobedience . But my chief distress was occasioned by a view of his perfect purity and holiness . My heart was filled with aversion and hatred towards a hofy God ; and I felt , that if admitted into heaven , with the feelings I then had , 1 should be as miserable as I could be in hell . In this state , I longed for annihilation ; and if I could have destroyed the existence of my soul , with as much ease as that of my body , I should quickly have done it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than they are to themselves , did not leave me to remain long in this distressing state . I be/gan to discover a beauty in the way of salvation by Christ He appeared to be just such a Saviour as I needed . I saw how God could be just , in saving sinners through him . I committed my soul into his hands , and besought him to do with me what seemed good in his sight . When I was thus enabled to commit myself into the hands of Christ , my ' mind was relieved from that distressing weight which had borne it down for so long a time . I did not think that I had obtained the new heart , which I had been seeking but felt happy in contemplating tip- character of Christ , and particularly that disposition , which led him to suffer so much , ka the sake of doing the will and promoting the N glory of his heavenly Father . A few days after this as I was reading Bellamy 's True Religion , 1 obtained a new view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemning the finally impenitent , which I had before viewed as cruel , now appeared to be an expression of hatred to sin , and regard to the good of beings in general A /z/ view of his purity and holiness filled my soul with wondef and admiration . I felt a disposition to commit myself reservedly into his hands , and leave it with him to save me or cast me off ; for I felt 1 could not be unhappy , while allowed the privilege of contemplating and loving so gkxious a Being . I now began to hope , that I had passed from death unto life . When I examined myself , I was constrained to own , that I had feelings and dispositions , to which I was formerly an utter stranger . I had swet communion with the blessed God , from day to day ; my heart was drawn out in love to Christians of whatever denomination ; the sacred Scriptures were sweet to my taste ; and such was my thirst for religious knowledge , that I frequently spent a great part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my views of myself and of God , from what they were , when I first began to inquire what I should do to be saved . I felt myself to be a poor lost sinner , titute of every thing to recommend myself to the divine vor : that I was , by nature , inclined to every evil way ; and that it had been the mere sovereign , restraining merey of God , not my own goodness , which had kept me from committing the most flagrant crimes . This view of myself hun-bled me in the dust , melted me into sorrow and contritioi for my sins , induced me to lay my soul at the feet of Christy and plead his merits alone , as the ground of my acceptance . 1 felt that if Christ had not died , to make an atonement for sin , I rould not ask God to dishonor his holy government so far as to save so polluted a creature , and that should he even now condemn me to suffer eternal puDishment , it would be so just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings in the universe would acquis esce in the sentence , and praise him as a just and righteous God . My chief happiness now consisted in contemplate tog the moral perfections of the glorious God . I longed to have all intelligent creatures love him ; and felt , that even fallen spirits could never be released from their obligations to love a fieing possessed of such glorious per-  --  fections. 1 felt happy in the consideration , that so benevolent a Being governed the world , and ordered every passing event . 1 lost all disposition to murmur at any providence assured that such a Being could not err in any dispensation . Sin , in myself and others , appeared as that nable thing , which a holy God hates  --  and I earnestly strove to avoid sinning , not merely because I was afraid of bell /q/ but because I feared to displease God , and grieve his Holy Spirit . I attended my studies in school , with far different feelings and different motives , from what I had ever dona before . I felt my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ; and since he in his providence had favor ed me with advantages for improving my mind , I felt that I should be like the slothful servant , if I neglected theoK 1 , therefore , diligently employed all my hours in school , in acquiring useful knowledge , and spent my evenings and part of the night in spiritual enjoyments . ' While thus recounting the mercies of God to my soui , I am particularly affected by two considerations ; the ricb* ness of that grace , which called and stopped nie in my dangerous course , and the ungrateful returns I make for sd distinguished a blessing . I am prone to forget the voice which called me out of darkness into light , and the hand which drew me from the horrible pit and the miry clay . When 1 first discerned my Deliverer , my grateful heart o fered him the services of a whole life , and resolved to acknowledge no other master . But such is the force of my native depravity , that I find myself prone to forsake him grieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark and dreary path of the backslider . I despair of making great attainments in the divine life , and look forward to death only , to free me from my sins and corruptions . Till that blessed period , that hour of my emancipation , I am resolved , through the grace and strength of my Redeemer , to maintain a constant warfare with my inbred sins , and endeavor to perform the duties incumbent on me , in whatever situation I may be placed . * Safely guide my wandering feet , Travelling in this vale of tears ; Dearest Saviour , to thy seat Lead , and dissipate my fears . ' " The change in her feelings and views , which she has thus described , was a thorough and permanent one . She immediately entered on the duties , and sought for the pleasures , of religion , with all the ardor of her natural character . Several letters to her young friends , written soon after this period , have been preserved . They are almost exclusively confined to religious topics ; and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the Saviour their refuge , breathe an earnest desire for their welfare , and a faithfulness in beseeching them to repent of their sins and believe in the Redeemer , which in- so MEMOIR OP MBS .

One might spend days with her , without hearing any other subject reverted to . The throne of grace , too , was her early and late resort . 1 have known her to spend cold winter evenings in a chamber without fire , and return to the family with a solemnity spread over her countenance , which told of Him with whom she had been bommuning . Nor was her love of social pleasures diminished , although the complexion of them was completely changed . Even at this late period , I fancy I see her , with strong feelings depicted on her countenance , indining over her Bible , rising to place it on the stand , retiring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding to visit this and that family , to speak of Him whom her soul loved . She thirsted for the knowledge of gospel truth , in all its relations and dependencies- Besides the daily study of Scripture , with Guise , Orton and Scott before her , she perused with deep interest the works of Edwards , Hopkins , Bellamy , Doddridge , &c.; With Edwards on Redemption , she was instructed , quickened , strengthened . Well do I remember the elevated smile which beamed on her countenance , when she first spoke to me of its precious contents . She had transcribed , with her own hand , Edwards ' leading and most striking remarks on this great subject . When reading Scripture , sermons , or other works , if she met with any sentiment or doctrine , which seemed dark and intricate , she would mark it , and beg the first clergyman who called at her father 's , to elucidate and explain it . " Her religious feelings were nevertheless affected by the same fluctuations as those of other Christians . The fervor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons of a more equable temperament , to the changes , which physical as well as moral causes occasion in the spiritual joys of Christians . Her piety did not consist in feeling ; but there is no true religion without feeling ; and the heart which has ever been suitably affected by the stupendous truths and hopes of Christianity , can not be satisfied with a dull insensibility , or even with a calm equanimity . There will be a consciousness of disproportion between the subjects which Christianity presents to the mind , and the feelings which they awaken ; and the self-reproach that will /q/ thus be occasioned , will be increased , by a recollection of the strong affections and lively joys which the heart experienced in the ardor of its first love . Every believer has frequent occasion to accuse himself of a want of lively sensibility to his privileges and duties ; and while he can look back to seasons when he was more zealous in his piety , and when his enjoyment of religious pleasures was greater than at present , he will fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unfaithfulness and coldness , and will write ' * bitter things " against himself . Mrs. Judson 's journal contains many details of these alternations of joy and sorrow , of hope and self-accusation , of which all Christians are , in some degree , partakers . A few extracts will now be inserted : " July 30 , 1806 . I find my heart cold and hard . I fear there is no spiritual life in me . I am in an unhappy state , for nothinor in life can afford me satisfaction without the light of God 's countenance .

If the young , in the midst of their diversions , could picture to themselves the Saviour hanging on the cross , his hands and feet streaming with blood , his head pierced with thorns , his body torn with scourges , and reflect , that by their wicked lives , they open those wounds afresh , they would feel constrained to repent , and cry for mercy on their souls . O my God , let me never more join with the wicked world , or take enjoyment in any thing short of conformity to thy holy will .

A journal of their daily experience would depict them , on one day , as rejoicing and steadfast believers , and on the next , perhaps , as harassed with doubts , not only of their personal piety , but of the truth of Christianity itself ; it would show them , at one time , as fervent in spirit , serving the Lord , and at another , as criminally conformed to this world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian to peruse such statements of the feelings of others ; because they in form him that his own joys and sorrows correspond with those of other Christians , and that occasional doubts and fears are not incompatible with genuine piety and prevailing hope . God himself has seen fit to give us , in his word , the spiritual exercises of several eminent saints , and especially of David , who seems to have been placed in almost every variety of human condition , and to have been visited with trials of every kind to which our nature is subject , that he might be an example to all future saints , and that his feelings and experience , as displayed in his Psalms , might comfort and instruct the church in every age . But the complaints and self reproaches of uninspired saints , may possibly be injurious to some professors of reli  - -  gion , by lowering the standard of piety , and appeasing their consciences for their own deficiencies .

The following letter of Mrs. J. written at an early period of her religious life , shows how correctly she thaughty in relation to the exercises of a renewed heart . She here ex* plains the cause of much of her own darkness of mind , and - elf distrust . Growth in grace requires an increasing ac* quaintance with the nature of sin , and of our unworthiness ; and this knowledge will be likely to darken and distress the mind , unless faith be strong , and the efficacy of the atonement be very clearly discerned . To MiM L. K. Newbury , 8. 30 , 1807 . You requested me , dear L , to write soon after my return . With pileasure I comply , as it fixes you in my imagi- it /q/ nation , and gives me sensations almost as pleasing as a verbal intercourse . O may that Spirit which unites the hearts of the children of God in love , direct my thoughts , and guide my pen to write that which may be useful in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the evidences of growth in grace . ' ' From reading the lives of pious people , and the word of God , I have come to the following conclusion , though different from my ideas formerly . " A person who grows in grace will see more and more of the dreadful wickedness of his heart ; of its opposition to every thing good ; and of its deceitfulness and fickleness . When Isaiah saw more of God and his glory , his first expressions were not  --  I am more like God , because I have seen more of him ; but his language was this . Wo is me , for I am undone , because I am a man of uncleon lips . The more grace Christians have , the more clearly they can see the contrast between holiness and sin ; and while it leads them to hunger , thirst and strive for the one , it leads them to loathe , abhor , and mourn for the other . Growth in grace will consequently lead them to know more about Jesus Christ , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour . He will appear to them daily more needful as a prophet , priest , and king , his character more lovely , and his spirit more desirable . They also feel more for the worth of souls . As they are convinced daily of the dreadful nature of sin , so they will feel more anxious to save sinners from the consequences of it . This will necessarily lead them to pray more often , earnestly and fervently , give them a disrelish for the vanities of the world , and a sincere and hearty desire to devote all they have to him , and serve him entirely . But one great evidence is not yet mentioned , perhaps the greatest . They will be constantly watching , and endeavoring to find whether they grow in grace . They will watch their improvement from tifne to time , in every portion of Holy Writ which they read , every sermon they hear , and the providences which occur , either afflictive or the contrary . , * ' These , dear L , are my ideas respecting the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient , if true , to convince us whether we make any improvement in a divine life . If we have made none , under the rich cultivation we have enjoyed , then we may be sure we are unacquainted with that path which is as a shining light , which sMneth more and more unto the perfect day " /z/ Mrs. Judson , early in her religious life , showed her de  - -  sire to be useful to her fellow men . Her active mind was not satisfied without some effort to benefit those around her . She accordingly engaged , soon after this period , in the occupation of instructing a school , impelled mainly by the desire to be useful . There are few situations , which furnish better opportunities of imparting permanent benefit , than that of the instructer of a school . In New England , this office is regarded with a good degree of the honorable estimation to which it is entitled ; and it is to be wished , that a larger number of educated young ladies would em* ploy themselves in a service so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rising generation . The following extract from Mrs. Judson 's journal , dated May 12 , 1807 , shows the conscientious principles which actuated her ; and proves that her mind was thus early swayed by the resolution to live not unto herself , but to Him who died for her , and rose again . Her zeal for the spiritual welfare of others , and her decision of character , are here seen , in a very striking light : " Have taken charge of a few scholars . Ever since I have had a comfortable hope in Christ , I have desired to devote myself to him , in such a way , as to be useful to my fellow creatures . As Providence has placed me in a situation of life , where I have an opportunity of getting as good an education as I desire , I feel it would be highly criminal in me not to improve it . 1 feel , also , that it would be equally criminal to desire to be well educated and accomplished , from selfish motives , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement , or my pride in being qualified to shine . I therefore resolved last winter , to attend the academy , from no other motive , than to improve the talents bestowed by God , so as to be more extensively devoted to - his glory , and the benefit of my fellow creatures . On being lately requested to take a small school , for a few months , I felt very unqualified to have the charge of little immortal souls ; but the hope of doing them good , by endeavoring to impress their young and tender minds with di vine truth , and the obligation I feel , to try to be useful , have induced me to comply . 1 was enabled to open the school with prayer . Though the cross was very great , I felt constrained , by a sense of duty , to take it up . The little creatures seemed astonished at such a beginning . Probably some of them had never heard a prayer before . O may I have grace to be faithful in instructing these little /q/ tals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heavenly Father . " She was engaged , at intervals , for several years , in teaching schools in different towns. * She was always diligent and faithful in her endeavors to enlighten the minds and to form the manners of her pupils ; but she regarded the year of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom ; and she strove to guide her dear pupils to the Saviour . She felt herself to be intrusted , in some measure , with the charge of their souls ; and she watched for them as one that must give account . It is believed , that her prayers and efforts were not in vain ; and that some of her pupils in this country will mingle their praises before the throne of the Redeemer , with those of ransomed Burmans , adoring him for her instrumentality in leading them to repentance and faith in his name . From her journal we select a few additional extracts , which will show the state of her feelings , and the progress of her piety . " June 12 . For a week or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and almost every duty has appeared burdensome . But , praised be God , I have enjoyed much , yesterday and to-day . I find , that reading the exercises of Miss Anthony has a great tendency to humble me , and quicken my spiritual life . I long to possess her spirit , and be as much engaged in the service of God , as that dear saint was . I feel an attachment to her , stronger than I ever felt for any person , while L was in an unconverted state . If love to the children of God is an evidence of having been born again , I have reason to think , that this is my happy case . I know that I love Christians , and love those most , who are most actively engaged in the cause of Christ ; and at the throne of grace , I feel , at times , my soul drawn out in love to them , and in as ardent desires for their spiritual welfare , as for my own .

In the evening had much conversation with some of the family on the subject of religion . Appearances rather encourag- /z/ acquiesced and rejoiced in them . If I enjoy comfort in any thing , it is when I have a realizing sense of God 's holy character . I feel happy , when I reflect that God will overrule all things for the promotion of his own glory . In my walk , this evening , my thoughts were intensely fixed on the greatness and majesty of the Supreme Being , and . on the numberless sins I have committed against him . Then they turned to the glorious way of salvation , which this great and most gracious Being has provided . I desir- ed to give myself entirely to Christ , have him for my Prophet , Priest , and King , be entirely devoted to him , and give him all the glory of my salvation . O Jesus , ever give me such views of thyself , as shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' * July 6 . It is just a year , this day , since I entertained a hope in Christ . About this time in the evening , when reflecting on the words of the lepers , If we enter into the city , then the famine is in the city and we shall die there ; and if we sit still here , we die also , I felt that if I returned to the world , I should surely perish ; if I staid where I then was , I should perish ; and I could but perish , if I threw myself on the mercy of Christ . Then came light , and relief , and comfort , such as I never knew before . O how lit ' tie have I grown in grace , since that time . How little engaged in religion am I now , compared to what I was then . Then the world had not the least share in my thoughts or heart . Nothing but religion engrossed my aflections , and I thought that nothing else ever would . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some evidence of being a true Christian ; for when contemplating the moral perfections of God , my heart is pleased with , and approves of , just such a Being . His law , which once appeared unjust and severe , now appears to be holy , just , and good . His justice appears equally glorious as his mercy , and illustrative of the same love to universal happiness . The way of salvation by Christ appears glorious , because herein God can be just , and yet display his mercy to the penitent sinner . " At this point , her regular journal ceases , and a few occasional paragraphs only have been preserved , concerning her subsequent views and feelings . They do not differ materially from those which have already been quoted , except that they show a gradual enlargement of desires for the prosperity of the church of God ; and indicate that God was preparing her mind for her future duties . /q/ " March 17  --  ( probably 1809 . ) Have had some enjoyment in reading the life of David Brainerd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excite desires to live as near to God as that holy man did . Have spent this evening in prayer for quickening grace . Felt my heart enlarged to pray for spiritual blessings for myself , my friends , the church at large , the heathen world , and the African slaves . Felt a willingness to give myself away to Christ , to be disposed of as he pleases . Here I find safety and comfort . Jesus is my only refuge . I will trust his word , and rest my soul in his hands . I will depend on him , not only for the salvation of my soul , but for daily grace and strength to persevere in a religious course . O may I now begin to live to God . ' ' 24 . At the commencement of the last week , I had high hopes of being more engaged in religion than ever before . But I have reason to fear , that I relied too much on my own strength .

In this way , I grieve the Holy Spirit , and bring darkness upon my mind . And yet I hope , that I have had some right feelings .

" /z/ Mrs , Judsons Connection with Mr , Judson . The event , which determined the nature of her future life , was her marriage with Mr. Judson . Some particulars respecting the circumstances which led to this connection , will now be stated . A few facts , however , in relation to Mr. Judson himself , must previously be mentioned . He was born at Maiden , ( Mass . ) August 9 , 1788 . He graduated at Brown University , in 1807 . Soon afterwards he commenced making the tour of the United States . * ' Some providential occurrences , while on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deistical sentiments which he had recently adopted . His mind became so deeply impressed with the probability of the divine authenticity of // the Scriptures , that he could no longer continue his journey , but returned to his father 's house , for the express purpose of examining thoroughly the foundation of the Christian religion . After continuing his investigations for some time , he became convinced that the Scriptures are of divine origin , and that he himself was in a lost situation by nature , and needed renovation previously to an admittance into heaven . It now became his sole inquiry . What shall I do to be saved ? " The Theological Seminary at Andover , Massachusetts , was about this time established ; but the rules of the institution required evidence of evangelical piety in all who were admitted . Mr. Judson was desirous of entering there , for the purpose of being benefitted by the theological lectures ; but hardly ventured to make application , conscious that he was destitute of the proper qualifications . His ardent desire , however , to become acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain religious instruction , overcame every obstacle , and he applied for admittance ; at the same time assuring the Professors of his having no hope that he had been a subject of regenerating grace . He was , notwithstanding , admitted ; and , in the course of a few weeks , gained satisfactory evidence of having obtained an interest in Christ , and turned his attentioD to those studies which were most calculated to make him useful in the ministry . " Some time in the last year of his residence in this theological seminary , he met with Dr. Buchanan 's " Star in the East . " This first led his thoughts to an Eastern Mission . The ; subject harassed his mind from day to day , and he felt deeply impressed with the importance of making some attempt to rescue the perishing millions of the East . He communicated these impressions to various individuals , but they all discouraged him . He then wrote to the Directors of the London Missionary Society , explaining his views , and requested information on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invitation to visit England , to obtain in person the necessary information . ' * Soon after this , Messrs . Nott , Newell and Hall , joined him , all of them resolving to leave their native land , and engage in the arduous work of Missionaries , as soon as Providence should open the way . " * * History of the Barman Mission , p. 14. /q/ There was , at that time , no Missionary Society , in this country , to which these young men could look for assistance and direction . The spirit of prayer and of exertion for the spread of the Gospel through the world , had not then been sufficiently diffused , to awaken the American churches to combined action for the support of foreign Missions . The formation of a Missionary Society in this country was , therefore , a desirable measure . As these young men were all Congregationalists , they looked , of course , to their own denomination for the aid which they needed . An opportunity was presented , to lay the subject before a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the Massachusetts Association , at Bradford , in June , 1810 . At this meeting , the following paper , written by Mr. Judson , * was presented : " The undersigned , members of the Divinity College , respectfully request the attention of their Reverend Fathers , convened in the General Association at Bradford , to the following statement and inquiries : ' They beg leave to state , that their minds have been long impressed with the duty and importance of personally attempting a Mission to the heathen ; that the impressions on their minds have induced a serious , and they trust , a prayerful consideration of the subject in its various attitudes , particularly in relation to the probable success , and the difficulties attending such an attempt ; and that after examining all the information which they can obtain , they consider themselves as devoted to this work for life , whenever God in his providence shall open the way . " They now offer the following inquiries , on which they solicit the opinion and advice of this Association . Whether , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * It is not the purpose of this work , to extol or to defend Mr. JudflOn . We shall therefore omit any notice of some unpleasant occurrences . We are not concerned to claim for him the exclusive honor A having led the way in originating the American Board of Commisdoners . This praise , however , has been attributed , in unqualified terms , to one of his associates . Life of Mills , p. 87 . It is , indeed , a point of little importance , what individual is honored by God as the instrument of signal benefits to mankind . His alone is the wisdom to inspire , and the strength to execute ; and the most distinguished of his servants are made to feel , that it is not hy their might or power , but by ki9 Spmt , that holy desires are cherished , and good purposes accomplished . We have contented ourselves with stating facts , leaving the reader to make his own inferences. /z/ M MEHom or mrs. jvdsos. nounce the object of Missions as visionary or impracttcabie ; if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern or the western world ; whether they may expect patronage and support from a Missionary Society in thier country , or must commit themselves to the direction of a European Society ; and what preparatory measures they ought to take previous to actual engagement ? " The undersigned , feeling their youth and inexperience , look up to their Fathers in the Church , and respectfully so licit their advice , direction , and prayers . Adoniram Judson , Jk . Samuel Nott , Jr . Samuel J. Mills . Samuel Newell . " This important paper was at first signed by two other individuals , Mr. Richards and Mr. Rice ; but their names were omitted , from a fear that the application of so many individuals , at one time , might occasion embarrassment " This document , " says the biographer of Mr. Millsv " was referred to a Special Committee , who , in their report , recognized the imperative obligation and importance of Missions  --  expressed their conviction that the gentlemen who had thus modestly expressed their views , ought not to r nounce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines of a plan , which at that meeting was carried into effect , in the appointment of a Board of Con missioners for Foreign Missions , for the purpose of deviling ways and means , and adopting and prosecuting measures for promoting the spread of the Gospel in heathen lands . " Mr. Judson and his associates expected and desired an immediate appointment as Missionaries ; but the Board , being unprovided with funds , and not having as yet matuied any plan of operations , advised them to continue their studies , and wait for further information . But fearing that several years might elapse before a missionary spirit would be sufficiently excited in this country , Mr. Judson solicited and obtained leave of the Board to visit England , to tain whether any measures of co-operation could be concerted between the London Missionary Society and the Board , and whether any assistance could be obtained from that Society , in case the Board itself should be unable to sustain a Mission. * * Instructions of tiie Board to Mr. Judson . MBMOIB OF MBS . JTOMON. 3t fie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeki after sailing , the vessel was captured by a French privateor ; and after being detained several weeks as a prisoner on board , he was confined in a prison at Bayonne . By the exertions of an American gentleman , he was released on parole , and at length with great difficalty he obftEtimed passports from the Emperor , and proceeded to England , where he arrived in May . It was fiMind , that no concert of measores could be ranged ; bat the London Society agreed to Mr. J. and his companions as Missionaries if the American Board ahonld not be able to do it. * Mr. J. returned to America , and at the meeting of the Board , at Worcester , in September , 1811 , he and one of his missaonary brethren earnestly solicited an immediate appointment , as they were extremely anxious to be ed in missionary Isdbors , a2id as there was a prospect of war between England and the United States , which wouUl probably interrupt their plans entirely . They stated , that if the Board was unable to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society . The Board resoked , notwithstanding the scantiiiess of its funda , to establish a Mission in Burmah ; and Messrs . JndsoD , Nott , Newell , and Hall , were immediately appoiMed . Messrs . Richards and Warren were received at tke same meeting , as Missionaries , with instructions , however , to continue thor studies for a while . Mr. Rice was wards appointed . It is interesting to contrast the state of the American Board , at that time , when its members hesitated , from a fear of the want of adequate funds , with the present condition of that powerful body . During the session of the Association , at Brildferd , in 1810 , Mr. Judson first saw Miss Haesekine . An acquaint ance was soon after formed , which led to a direct offer of marriage on his part , including , of course , a proposition to her , to accompany him in his missionary enterprise . * It is said , Life of Mills , p. 40. that Mr. Judson " felt himself justified in entering into partial arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become their Missionary in the East Indies . " The fact u , that Mr. J. made no arrangement which interfered with his preference to receive the appointment of the American Bowd . The London Society gave to him and his associates instructioiis , to be used at their option . /z/ She was thus placed in a situation of peculiar difficulty and delicacy . The influence which her affections ought to have , in deciding a question of this kind , it would not , in ordinary cases , have been difficult to determine . But in this case , her embarrassment was increased , by the conflict which might arise between aflection and duty . A person so conscientious as she was , would wish to form a decision on the important question of her duty , respecting missionary labors , uninfluenced by any personal considerations . Hesitation tp assume an office so responsible , and so arduous , would spring up in any mind ; but Miss Hasseltine was required to decide on this point , in connection with another , itself of the utmost consequence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her personal feelings ; and she might have some painful suspicions , lest her aflections might bias her decision to become a Missionary ; while female delicacy and honor would forbid her to bestow her hand , merely as a preliminary and necessary arra , ngement . There was another circumstance which greatly increased the difficulty of a decision . No female had ever left America as a Missionary to the heathen . The general opinion was decidedly opposed to the measure . It was deemed wild and romantic in the extreme , and altogether inconsistent with prudence and delicacy . Miss H. had no example to guide and allure her . She met with no encouragement from the greater part of those persons , to whom she applied for counsel . Some expressed strong disapprobation of the project . Others would give no opinion . Two or three individuals , whom it might not be proper to name , were steady , afiectionate advisers , and encouraged her to go . With these exceptions , she was forced to decide from her own convictions of duty , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cause of Missions , that God assigned to Miss Hasseltine the honorable yet difficult office of leading the way in this great enterprise . Her adventurous spirit and her decision of character eminently fitted her The remark of one lady respecting Mrs. J. would express the feelings of many others . " I hear , " said she , " that Miss H. is going to India . Why does she go ? " " Why , she thinks it her duty ; would not you go , if you thought it your duty ? ** " But , " replied the good lady , with emphasis , " / wotUd not think it my duty " Many questions of duty , it may he suspected , are decided in this summary manner . to resolve , where others iiroald hesitate , and to advance , where others might retreat . She did decide to go , and her determination , without doubt has had some elect on the minds of other females , who have since followed her example. * To Mrs. Judson undoubtedly belongs the praise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends and country , to bear the Gospel to the heathen in fereign climes . Her journal at this time shows that her mind was in a state of extreme anxiety , and that she resorted for direction and help to Him who gives wisdom to the ignorant , and who guides the medc in judgment : / ' Aug. 8 , 1810 .

At times I have felt satisfied , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfections , and have been desirous that he should do with me as he should please , and place me in that sit- % uation , in which I can be most useful . I have felt great satisfaction in committing this case to God , knowing that he has a perfect understanding of the issue of all events , is infinitely wise to select the means best calculated to bring about the most important ends , and is able and willing to make the path of duty plain before me , and incline mo to walk therein . At other times , I have felt ready to sink being distressed with fears about my spiritual state , and . appalled at the prospect of pain and suffering , to which my nature is so averse , and apprehensive , that when assailed by temptation , or exposed to danger and death , I should y not be able to endure , as seeing Him who is invisible .

He is the fountain of all grace ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause , among those who know him not , he can qualify me for the work , and enable me to bear whatever he is pleased to inflict . I am fully satisfied , that difficulties and trials are more conducive , than ease and prosperity , to promote my growth in grace , and cherish an habitual sense of dependence on God . While the latter please my animal nature , and lead me to seek happiness in creature enjoyments , the farmer afford convincing proofs that this life is designed to be a state of trial , and not a state of st , and thus tend to wean me from the world , and make me look up to heaven as my home . Time appears nothing when compared with eternity , and yet events the most momentous depend on the improvement of these - fleeting years .

But when 1 recollect , that God has promised to hear the cries of the poor and needy , and that he has even given his Son to die for those who are sunk deep in sin , I find some encouragement to prostrate myself before the mercy seat , and plead the divine promises . Of late , I have had but little enjoyment , though my mind has been constantly exercisea with divine truth . Yet I hope , that God will overrule these trials for my good .

It web not the impulse of an adventurous spirit , panting for scenes of difficulty and danger . They had cherished no romantic views of the missionary enterprise . They had calmly estimated its hazards and its toils . They foresaw what it would cost them , and the issue to which it would probably lead them both . They knew well what they must do and suffer ; and they yielded themselves as willing sacrifices for the sake of the far distant heathen . As a proof of this , an extract of a letter from Mr. JudsoQ to Mr. Hasseltine may here be quoted . It is in every view a remarkable document . Its design was , to ask tha father 's consent to his daughter 's marriage , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the writer and to the parent . An ordinary lover would have solicited the desired consent , by a strong statement of every encouraging consideration , and by throwing the bright tints of hope over the dark clouds which enveloped the future . Mr. Judson resorted to no such artifice . He knew that the case was too solemnly interesting for any thing but simplicity and godly sincerity . He knew that the excellent man whom he addressed , was capable of sacrificing his feelings to his duty , and was able to decide the painful question proposed to him , in single hearted sabmis* sion to his Saviour 's will . After mentioning to Mr. H. that he had offered marriage to his daughter , and that she had said something about consent of parents , " Mr. Judson proceeds thus : /z/ " I have now to ask , whether you can consent to part with your daughter early next spring , to see her no more in this world ; whether you can consent to her departure lor a heathen land , and her subjection to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can conseoi to her exposure to the dangers of the ocean ; to the fatal influence of the southern climate of India ; to every kind of want and distress ; to degradation , insult , persecution , and perhaps a violent death .

" Mr. and Mrs. Judson were married at Bradford , February /z/ Embarkation  --  Voyage  --  Arrival at Caicntta , On the 6th of February , 1812 , Mr. Jiidson , and Messrs . Samuel Newell , Samuel Nott , Jr . Gordon Hall , and Luther Rice , were ordained , as Missionaries , in the Tabernacle Church , in Salem . On the 19th of February , Messrs .

Never weie men engaged in a nobler service . Never did benevolence impel men to a more worthy sacrifice of ease , and of all that the heart values in the domestic relations , and in civilized society .

The whole argument lies within a narrow compass , and may be well stated in the language of Dr. Johnson , whose gigantic mind was little liable to be affected by the wa ward impulses of enthusiasm . ' ' If . obedience to the will of God be necessary to happiness , and knowledge of his will be necessary to obedience , I know not how he that vtf'ithholds this knowledge , or delays it , can be said to love his neighbor as himself . He that voluntarily continues ig* norance , is guilty of all the crimes which ignorance produces ; as to him that should extinguish the tapers of a light-house , might justly be imputed the calamities of shipwrecks. " * * Boffwell* ! Life of Johnmk /q/ Mrs. Judson was now afloat on an untried element , which was bearing her rapidly away from her home and kindred . The struggle , in a heart so strong in its affections as hers , must have been severe .

She knew well what she must surrender , and the objects which called for the sacrifice ,  --  and she left all , for the sake of her Saviour , and of her perishing fellow men . Why should such disinterested benevolence and heroic firmness fail to obtain the applause of men , who are ready to admire and praise these qualities , when exerted on other occasions and for other objects ? Why should the voice of eloquence , and the lyre of the poet , which delight to commemorate the self-denial , and patriotism , and noble daring of the wise and good , be mute , when the Missionary departs on his errand of mercy ? The memory of Lady Arabella Johnson has been the recent theme of eulogy , on the spot where Mrs. Judson embarked for India. * In what worthy quality of heart or mind was the Missionary inferior to the accomplished Puritan 1 How did the arduous enterprise of Mrs. J. in grandeur of aim , generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of that which has embalmed the memory of Lady Johnson ?

I spent some time this evening on deck . The weather was pleasant ; the motion of the vessel gentle , though rapid ; the full moon shone clearly on the water ; and all things around conspired to excite pleasing though melancholy sensations . My native land , my home , my friends , and all my forsaken enjoyments , rushed into my mind ; my tears flowed profusely , and I could not be comforted .

I see that there is no situation in life in which trials and enjoyments , pains and pleasures , are not intermingled .

Yet I have never regretted having left them for the cause of Christ . No , my dear Lydia , in my most gloomy hours , or in the apparent near approach of death , I never have , for a moment , , repented my having chosen the rugged , thorny path through which a Missionary must pass , in preference to the smooth and easy life I might have led in my native country .

I kept my bed for the most of the time for four days . We had a strong , favorable wind the first week we sailed , which carried us into mild , comfortable weather . The change of the weather in so short a time was so great , to gether with sea-sickness and the want of exercise , that I soon lost all relish for my food . Every thing tastedLdifferently from what it does on land , and those things I was the most fond of at home , I loathed the most here , fiut I soon began to find the real cause of my ill health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could invent nothing which could give us exercise equal to what we had been accustomed to . Jumping the rope was finally invented , and this we found to be of great use . I began and jumped it several times in the day , and found my health gradually return , antil I was perfectly well . I mention these particulars , that you should you ever go to sea , may escape ill health . I never enjoyed more perfect health in my life than I do now ; and I attribute it to my exercising so much . " We found it exceedingly hot the first time that we crossed the equator . When going round the Cape of Good Hope , wc had rough , rainy weather for twenty days . 1 never knew till then " the dangers of the deep .

We know not where we shall go , or in what part of the world we shall spend our remaining days . But I feel willing to leave it all with our heavenly Father . I doubt not he will protect us , and place us in that station in which we shall be most useful . I have spent the most of my time , since on the water , in reading . I knew I needed a more intimate acquaintance with the sacred Scriptures ; consequently , I have confined my attention almost exclusively to them . I have read the New Testament once through in course , two volumes of Scott 's Commentary on the Old , 5S MEMOim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick , on the Inspiration of the Scriptures , together with Faber and Smith on the Prophecies .

O my dear Lydia , how much enjoyment Chifistians lose by neglecting to study the Bible .

But God is good in bringing us into circumstances , where we are compelled to trust in him . God is every where , and is ever ready to hear our cries , and succor us in our distresses .

I have written to mamma and sister E. the particulars respecting my voyage thus far ; consequently , it is unnecessary for me now to say any more . Day before yesterday we came in sight of land , after being out only one hundreid and twelve days . We could distinguish nothing on land except the towering mountains of Golccmia . Yesterday morning we were nearer land , and could /q/ easily discover the trees on the shore . Some appeared to be placed regularly in rows , others were irregular and scattered . The scene was truly delightful , and reminded me of the descriptions I have read of the fertile shores of India  --  the groves of orange and palm trees . 1 likewise thought it probable that these shores were inhabited by a race of beings , by nature like ourselves , but who , not like as , are ignorant of the God who made them , and the Saviour who died for them . Yesterday we saw two vessels . One was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a British man-of-war , as she was lying still till we came up with her . As soon as she hoisted the flag , we found her to be an American . We had high hopes of her being the vessel in which the other Missionaries sailed . With impatience we came up with her . She hailed us , and wished to know our longitude . Our Captain asked her name , and where she was from , and to our great disappointment , we found she was not the Harmony . You have no idea how interesting the sight  --  a vessel at the side of us , so near that we could hear the Captain speak  --  for he was the first person we have heard speak since we sailed , except what belong to the ship . The other was an English vessel , she spoke with us to-day . e are now at anchor in the Bay of Bengal , and dare not go any farther to night , as we have not yet got a pilot . Every thing before us is uncertain . Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall live , is known only to our heavenly Father . " Monday , We have been very anxious this morning to get a pilot . At length a vessel was seen at a distance , and it proved to be a pilot vessel . He has just this moment come on board , with his two servants . One of them is a Hindoo . He exactly answers the description we have had of those poor benighted creatures . He looks as simple and feminine as you can imagine . What an alteration would a belief in Christianity make in such a degraded creature . If we have a favorable wind , we hope to get to Calcutta tomorrow . O how soon will our labors in the Mission begin ! Yet we are happy the time is so near , when we may begin to labor for Christ in a pagan land . ' Tuesday , Last night was the most dangerous , and to me , by far the most unpleasant we have had . The navigation here being dangerous , on account of the sand shoals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea was high , and kept the vessel in continual motion . About ten , the mate came down , and told us the cable had parted , and /z/ the anchor gone . I thought all hope of oar safety was entirely gone ; and immediately began to inquire into my pre* paredness for an entrance into another world . The thought of being shipwrecked was exceedingly distressing ; and I could not but think the providence of God would preserve us , on account of this infant Mission . In him I confided , and he preserved us . They got the ship under way ; and the pilot being well acquainted with the shoals , we met with no difficulty . 1 slept none at all , in consequence of the continual noise , and profane language on deck . The Captain has never used any profane language since we have been with him ; but the pilot , much more than we have ever heard before . The scene is now truly delightful . We are sailing up the river Hoogly , a branch of the Ganges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly discover objects . On one side.of us are the Sunderbunds  --  islands at the mouth of the Ganges . The smell which proceeds from them is fragrant beyond description . We have passed the mango trees , and some large brick houses . " Wednesday* I have never , my dear sister , witnessed at read any thing so delightful as the present scene . On each side of the Hoogly , where we are now sailing , are the Hindoo cottages , as thick together as the houses in our sear ports . They are very small , and in the form of hay-stacks , without either chimneys or windows . They are situated in the midst of trees , which hang over them , and appear truly romantic . The grass and fields of rice are perfectly green , and herds of cattle are every where feeding on the banks of the river , and the natives are scattered about , dii ferentiy employed . Some are fishing , some driving the team , and many are sitting indolently on the banks of the river . The pagodas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses . Notwithstanding the scene is so pleasant , on account of the works of nature , yet it is truly melancholy when we reflect , that these creatures , so numerous , so harmless , have immortal souls , and like us are destined to the eternal world  --  and yet have none to tell them of Christ I suppose the natives that live on these shores , for many miles , have never seen a Missionary . I should be happy to come and live among them , in one of their little houses , if it was as large a field for usefulness as some others . There are many elegant English seats near the shore . We are within four or five miles of Calcutta . When we get there I will write you again . O what reason have we to be thankful , for so pleasant , so /q/ prosperous a voyage . There is seldom a voyage so short as ours  --  we have not yet been out four months . I hope God will make us useful , and keep us near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here we are safe in Calcutta harbor , and almost stunned with the noise of the natives . Mr. Judson has gone on shore , to find a place for us to go . This city is by far the most elegant of any 1 have ever seen . Many ships are lying at anchor , and hundreds of natives all around . They are dressed very curiously with white , hanging loosely over their shoulders . But I have not time to describe any thing at present . We have plenty of fruit on board . The bananas are a very delicious fruit ; they taste much like a rich pear . ' ' Thursday . Harriet and T are yet on board the vessel , and have not been on land . Mr. Judson did not return yesterday , until the evening , and had not gained permission from the Police office to live in the country , consequently we could not go on shore . Mr. J. and Mr. Newell are gone again to-day , and what will be their success , I know not . The East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely given liberty to their own countrymen to settle here as preachers . We have nothing to expect from man , and every thing from God . I think 1 never have felt more confidence in God , to protect and direct this Mission , than this morning . If he has any thing for us to do here , he will doubtless open a door for our entrance ; if not , he will send us to some other place . We have given ourselves to him , devoted ourselves to his service , and have every reason , from past experience of his mercy , still to trust and confide in his goodness . O my dear sister , what a source of happiness and comfort , that God reigns , even on these heathen shores of darkness and wretchedness . Captain Heard has just come on board , and given OS a very polite invitation to go to the house he has procured for himself on shore . The politeness and kindness of this man have been remarkable . Throughout our passage , he has treated us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it otherwise would have been . O , live near to God in a Christian land , and think , ieel and pray much for the millions who are perishing for the want of the knowledge of a Saviour . So little time as we have to live in this world , must be improved to the best advantage . We shall soon meet in the eternal world , and thea Sie more we have done for Christ , the happier we // /z/ Difficulties with the Bengal Government  --  Mr. and Mrs. Jtidson and Mr , Rice become Baptists , On the 18th of June , 1812 , the Missionaries landed at Calcutta , where they were met and welcomed to India , by the venerable Dr. Carey . He immediately invited them to Serampore , to reside in the mission family , until the other Missionaries , in the Harmony , should arrive. * They accordingly stayed one night in Calcutta , and the next morning , they took a boat , and went up the river , fifteen miles , to Serampore . Here they were received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. speaks , in warm terms , of the piety , industry , economy , and order , which distinguished the operations at that great missionary es " tablisbment . Messrs . Carey , Marshman , and Ward , then resided there with their families . Dr. Carey was employed in translating the Scriptures ; Dr. Marshman , his wife , and son , taught a male and female school . Mr. Ward superintended the extensive printing establishment . The following letter of Mrs. J. contains some interesting particulars : To her Sister . " Serampore MissionHouse , " I have left your letter , my dear sister M. until the last , to continue my narrative to the family . I concluded A 's with saying . Captain Heard had just invited us to go to his house . Mr. Judson came on board with an invitation from Dr. Carey to spend the night with him . I got into a palenkeen  --  Mr. Judson walked to the house . It was with considerable fear I rode , as the streets were full of natives and English carriages . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I soon lost sight of him , and did not know where they would carry me . They , however , stopped before a large stone building , which I soon found to be Dr. Carey 's house . We were directed up a pair of stairs , through one or two large rooms , into his Btudy . He arose , shook hands with us , and gave us a cordial welcome to this country . His house is curiously con- - Th . H  --   --  ony arrived dx week , after the C  --   --  r  --  A -% /q/ structed , as the other Earopean houses are here . There are no chimnies or fire-places in them , the roofis are flat , the rooms twenty feet in height , and proportionably large . Large windows , without glass , open from one room to another , that the air may freely circulate through the house . They are very convenient for this hot climate , and bear every mark of antiquity . In the evening we attended meeting in the English Episcopal Church . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months , and as we entered the church , our ears were delighted with hearing the organ play our old favorite tune , Bangor . The church was very handsome , and a number of punkies , something like a fan several yards in length , hung around , with ropes fastened to the outside , which were pulled by some of the natives , to keep the church cool . We spent the night at Dr. Carey 's , and were rejoiced to find ourselves once more in a house on land . Very near the house , is a charity school supported by this mission , in which are instructed two hundred boys and nearly as many girls . The ; are chiefly children of Portuguese parents , and natives of no cast . We could see them all kneel in prayer time , and hear them sing at the opening of the school . It was really affecting to see these poor children , picked up in the streets , learning to sing the praise and read the word of God . ' ' While at Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridegroom was carried in a palankeen , with flowers in his hands , and on his head . He appeared to be about ten years of age . The procession were dressed in uniform , with large branches of flowers , and instruments of music . The Hindoos are frequently married when children , the contract being made by their parents . In the afternoon , we lefl Calcutta , for Serampore , having previously received an invitation from the Missionaries to reside with them , until our brethren arrive . We were met at the water side by Messrs . Marshman and Ward , who led us to the house , and introduced us to their wives . They received us very cordially . The school kept by Mrs. Marshman consists almost entirely of the children belonging to the mission , and European young ladies . They are taught various kinds of needle-work , embroidery , d &c.; and study the languages . Mrs. Marshman 's eldest daughter , fourteen years of age , reads and writes Bengalee and English ; and has advanced some way in Latin Greek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , but all eat together , in a large hall in the mission house . The bell rings at five in the morning , for the boys to arise for school . Again at eight , for breakfast . Immediately after breakfast , we all assemble in the chapel , for prayers . Begin with singing a hymn , in which most of the children join ; read a chapter in the Bible , and conclude with prayer . On the Sabbath , they have worship in English , from eleven till one : In Bengalee , for the natives , in the afier* noon , and in English again in the evening . Monday evening they have a religious conference for the native brethren and sisters . Tuesday morning an hour is spent in explaining passages of Scripture . Thursday and Saturday evenings , in conference meetings . These Missionaries are eminently pious as well as learned . The garden is as far superior to any in America , as the best garden in America is to a common farmer 's . It consists of several acres , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plants , flowers and vegetables , grow here in great abundance . The pine-apple grows on a low bush , the plantain on a tall stalk , and the cocoa-nut on a high tree , resembling our pine tree . ** The third day after we came here , there was a celebration of the worship of Juggernaut . We went about ten in the morning . The immense multitude of natives assembled on the occasion , and the noise they made , answered to the account Buchanan gave . The idol was set on the top of a stone building . He is only a lump of wood , his face painted with large black eyes , and a large red mouth . He was taken from his temple , and water poured on him to bathe him . This is introductory to a more solemn act of worship , which will be performed a fortnight hence . Afler these poor deluded creatures had bathed their god , they proceeded to bathe themselves . Poor , miserable , deluded beings , they know not what they do . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slavery and wretchedness , compared with the natives of India . So very numerous , they can not get employ ; and whn they do , they are treated by Europeans like beasts more than like men . Many of them die for the want of nourishment . Add to all this , they are ignorant of the only way of salvation . Who would not pity the poor heathen , and rej ( Hce to contribute their mite to relieve some of their distresses ! ' ' /q/ After they had been here about ten days , Messrs . Judson and Newell were summoDed to Calcutta , and an order of the government was read to them , requiring them immediately to leave the country , and return to America . The government of India , at that time , were resolutely opposed to missions . Their motives we need not now canvass . The charter of the East India Company , which was renewed in 1813 , was so amended in its passage through Parliament , by the zealous exertions of Wilberforce , Smith , Thornton , Fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to secure toleration for missionary efforts . The British possessions in the East were constituted an Episcopal See , and placed under the superintendence of a Bishop , and three Archdeacons . The Rev. Dr. Middleton was the first Bishop , and was succeeded by Bishop Heber , who has since died . It is just to say , that a great change of feeling has taken place among the officers of government , and the European residents in India . Their fears concerning the ef* fects of missionary operations have subsided , and they are disposed to favor and promote them . This order was a very alarming and distressing one . The thought of returning , without accomplishing , in any degree , their object , was insupportable . The instructions of the Board of Commissioners , when they left America , directed them to fix the seat of their mission in the Burman empire , unless circumstances should render it inexpedient to attempt it . All the Missionaries , however , thought it impracticable to establish a mission there . The despotic character of the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel into that empire , induced them to renounce the idea of a Burman mission . Mr. Nott , in a letter to a friend , said , ** The Burman empire seems at present out of the question . " Mrs. Newell , in her journal , July 16 , 1812 , says : " We can not feel that we are called in providence to go to Burmah . Every account we have from that savage , barbarous nation , confirms us in our opinion , that the way is not prepared for the spread of the Gospel there . " They therefore petitioned for leave to go to the Isle of France , which was granted ; and Mr. and Mrs. Newell sailed about the 1st of August . As the vessel could accommodate but two passengers , Mr. and Mrs. Judson remained in Calcutta two months longer . They were entertained with the most liberal hospitality , at the house of Mr. Rolt , an English gentleman ; and the treatment which they received from other /z/ Christian friends was kind and soothing to their feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the following letter to her sisters : ' ' Calcutta , Aug , 83 , 1612 . ' ' Hy dear Sisters , " A melancholy pleasure pervades my mind , when I take up my pen to address those whom I love , and whom I never expect to meet again in this world . When think* ing of my friends and much loved native land , I frequently join with Ossiao in saying , ' There is a joy in grief , when peace dwells in the breast of the sad . ' Grief for the de* privation of my friends , I love to indulge ; and I find eve* ry such indulgence binds them more closely to my heart . Can I forget thee , O my country ? Can I forget the scenes of childhood , and the more endearing scenes of riper years ? Can I forget the parental roof , sisters , companions and associates of my life 1 No , never ! Never , till this pulse ceases to beat , this heart to feel . Yet , my dear girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret having left my native land . I never was happier , never was more cheerfol , and never more satisfied in having engaged in my arduous undertaking . " The following paraaph , from the same letter , is quoted here , because the opmion of Mrs. Judson , on the subject referred to , is entitled to much weight , and applies , with equal force , to almost every heathen country : *'Good female schools are extremely needed in this country . I hope no Missionary will ever come out here , without a wife , as she , in her sphere , can be equally useful with her husband . I presume Mrs. Marshman does more good in her school , than half the ministers in America . " An event occurred , at this time , which it is necessary to state . Mr. and Mrs. Judson , and Mr. Rice , whose minds were led , during the voyage from America , to a consideration of the subject of baptism , became convinced , soon after their arrival in India , that their former sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were baptized in Calcutta . This change is interesting in itself , and in its consequences ; for it resulted in the establishment of the Burman Mission , and in the formation of the Baptist General Convention in the United States . The great Head of the church seems /q/ to have made this a leading event in that series of causes which aroused the Baptist Churches in America , to the duty of engaging in Foreign Missions . The progress of this change in the opinions of Mr. and Mrs. Judson will be related , without comment , in their own words . It is due to them to prove , undeniably , that it was the result of a thorough and deliberate investigation ; that it was a simple obedience to what they believed to be the truth ; and that it cost them sacrifices of feeling and of interest , of which persons less pious would have been incapable . From Mrs. Judson 's journal and letters a few extracts will be made , which will sufficiently establish these points . A letter , written ailer her arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now , my dear parents and sisters , give you some account of our change of sentiment , relative to the subject of Baptism . Mr. Judson 's doubts commenced while on our passage from America . While translating the New Testament , in which he was engaged , he used frequently to say , that the Baptists were right in their mode of administering the ordinance . Knowing he should meet the Baptists at Serampore , he felt it important to attend to it more closely , to be able to defend his sentiments . After our arrival at Serampore , his mind for two or three weeks was so much taken up with missionary inquiries , and our difficulties with government , as to prevent his attending to the subject of baptism . But as we were waiting the arrival of our brethren , and having nothing in particular to attend to , he again took up the subject . I tried to have him give it up , and rest satisfied in his old sentiments , and frequently told him if he became a Baptist , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it his duty to examine closely a subject on which he had so many doubts . After we removed to Calcutta , he found in the library in our chamber , many books on both sides , which he determined to read candidly and prayerfully , and to hold fast , or embrace the truth , however mortifying , however great the sacrifice . I now commenced reading on the subject , with all my prejudices on the Pedobaptist side . We had with us Dr. Worcester 's , Dr. Austin 's , Peter Edwards ' , and other Pedobaptist writings . But after closely examining the subject for several weeks , we were constrained to acknowledge that the truth appeared to lie on the Baptists ' side . It was extremely trying to reflect on the consequences of our becoming Baptists . We knew it would /z/ wound and grieve our dear Christian friends in that we should lose their approbation and esteem . We thought it probable the Commissioners would refuse to support us ; and what was more distressing than any thing , we knew we must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some heathen land . These things were very trying to us , and caused our hearts to bleed for anguish . We felt we bad no home in this world , and no friend but each other . Our friends at Serampore were extremely surprised when we wrote them a letter requesting baptism , as they had known nothing of our having had any doubts on the subject . We were baptized on the 6th of September , in the Baptist chapel in Calcutta . Mr. J. preached a sermon at Calcutta on this subject soon after we were baptized , which , in compliance with the request of a number who heard it , he has been preparing for the press . Brother Rice was baptized several weeks after we were . It was a very great relief to our minds to have him join us , as we expected to be entirely alone in a mission . ' ' The day afer her baptism , she wrote to her parents an account of the progress of their inquiries on the subject , in which she mentions some additional particulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayerfully , let the result be what it would . No one in the mission family knew the state of his mind , as they never conversed with any of us on this subject . I was very fearful be would become a Baptist , and frequently suggested the unhappy consequences if he should . He always answered , that his duty compelled him to examine the subject , and he hoped he should have a disposition to embrace the truth , though he paid dear for it . I always took the Pedobaptists ' side in reasoning with him , although I was as doubtful of the truth of their system as he . After we came to Calcutta , he devoted his whole time to reading on this subject , having obtained the best authors on both sides . Afler having ex " amined and re-examined the subject , in every way possible , and comparing the sentiments of both Baptists and Pedobaptists with the Scriptures , he was compelled , from a conviction of the truth , to embrace those of the former . I confined my attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Testament , and tried to find something to favor infant baptism , but was convinced it had no foundation there . I examined the covenant of circumcisioD , /q/ and could see no reason for condading that baptism was to be administered to children , because circumcisioii was . Thus , my dear parents and sisters , we are both confirmed Baptists , not because we wished to be , but because truth compelled us to be . A renunciation of our former sentiments has caused us more pain , than any thing which ever happened to us through our lives . " Several extracts from her journal will more fully disclose her feelings at this time , and will show how reluctantly she came to the result : " Aug , 10 . Besides the trials occasioned by the orders of government , I see another heavy trial just coming upon me . Mr. J. 's mind has been for some time much exercised in regard to baptism . He has been lately examining the subject more closely . All his prejudices are in favor of Pedobaptism ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided in the path of duty . If he should renounce his former sentiments , he must offend his friends at home , hazard his reputation , and , what is still more trying , be separated from his missionary associates . " 23 . T have been much distressed the week past , in view of the probable separation between our missionary brethren and ourselves . Mr. J. feels convmced from Scripture , that he has never been baptized , and that he can not conscientiously administer baptism to infants . This - change of sentiment must necessarily produce a separation . As we are perfectly united with our brethren in every other respect , and are much attached to them , it is inexpressibly painful to leave them , and go alone to a separate station . But every sacrifice that duty requires , must be made . I do not myself feel satisfied on the subject of baptism having never given it a thorough examination . But I see many difiiculties in the Pedobaptist theory , and must acknowledge that the face of Scripture does favor the Baptist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hope that I shall be disposed to embrace the truth , whatever it may be . It is painfully mortifying to my natural feelings , to think seriously of renouncing a system which I have been taught from infancy to believe and respect . O that the Spirit of God may enlighten and direct my mind  --  may prevent my retaining an old error , or embracing a new one ! /z/ " Sept , 1 . I have been examining the subject of baptism for some time past , and , contrary to my prejudices and my wishes , am compelled to believe , that believers ' baptism alone is found in Scripture . If ever I sought to know the truth ; if ever I looked up to the Father of lights ; if ever I gave up myself to the inspired word , I have done so during this investigation . And the result is , that , laying aside my former prejudices and systems , and fairly appealing to the Scriptures , I feel convinced that nothing really can be said in favor of infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O may our hearts be prepared for that holy ordinance ! and as we are baptized into a profession of Christ , may we put on Christ , and walk worthy of the high vocation wherewith we are called . But in consequence of our performance of this duty , we must make some very painful sacrifices . We must be separated from our dear missionary associates , and labor alone in some isolated spot . We must expect to be treated with contempt , and cast off by many of our American friends  - -  forfeit the character we have in our native land , and prober bly have to labor for our own support , wherever we are stationed . O , our heavenly Father , wilt thou be our friend . Wilt thou protect us , enable us to live to thy glory , and make us useful in some retired part of this eastern world , in leading a few precious souls to embrace that Saviour whom we love and desire to serve . " 5 . Every week and day convinces me of the goodness and care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy , when my soul is cast down with distressing apprehensions , he leads me to feel my dependence on him , and lean on the bosom of Infinite Love . I am now willing to acquiesce in the divine dealings with us , and go alone with Mr. J. to that place which Providence shall direct . I feel confident that Jesus will go with us , and direct our steps ; and in that case , it is of little consequence whether we have more or less society . When I consider how short my life will probably be , and how soon the eternal world will open to my view , I wonder at myself for having had so much anxiety about the place where , and the circumstances in which , I shall spend these few days . O for a true missionary spirit , and a willingness to suffer all things for the cause of Christ . " Oct. 2 . Have had an uncommon sense of divine things , for some time past , and found great consolation in committing all my concerns into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 several days my mind has been so much impreflsed with tho goodness of God , that I could not help repeating to myself . How good is God ! O for such an habitual sense of his moral perfections as banishes all anxiety and distrust . ** Nov , 1 . /Sabbath , Another opportunity of celebrating the love of Jesus at his table . It has been a sweet season to my soul , a season of renewed dedication of myself to his service . I never saw a more striking display of the love of God , than was manifested in those who came around the communion table , and who have been emphatically called from the highways and hedges  --  Hindoos and Portuguese , Armenians and Musselmans , could join with Europeans and Americans , in commemoratiog the dying love of Jesus . Surely nothing but divine grace could have removed prejudices , early and inveterate , from the minds of these 4ifrerent characters , and united them in the same sentiments and pursuits . " Brother Rice was this day baptized . He has been examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was his duty to be baptized in Christ 's appointed way . I consider it a singular favor , that Grod has given us one of our brethren to be our companion in travels , our associate and fellow laborer in missionary work . " Mr. Judson , in a letter to Dr. BoUes , of Salem , dated Calcutta , September 1 , 1813 , says : * ' Within a few months I have experienced an entire change of sentiments on the subject of Baptism . My doubts concerning the correctness of my former system of belief , commenced during my passage from America to this country ; and after many painful trials , which none can know , but those who are taught to relinquish a system in which they had been educated , I settled down in the full persuasion , that the immersion of a professing believer in Christ is the only Cfhristian Baptism . * ' Mrs. Judson is united with me in this persuasion . We have signified our views and wishes to the Baptist Missionaries at Serampore , and expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation from my missionary brethren , and a dissolution of my connection with the Board of Commissioners , seem to be necessary consequences . The Missionaries at Serampore are exerting themselves to the utmost of their /z/ ability , in managing and sapporting their extensive and complicated mission . " Under these circumstances , 1 look to you . Alone , in this foreign , heathen land , I make my appeal to those , whom , with their permission , I will call my Baptist breth ' ren in the United States . " The Baptist Missionaries at Serampore had no agency in producing this change . Dr. Carey , in a letter to Dr. Staughton , dated Oct. 20 , 1812 , says : ' ' Since their arrival in Bengal , brother and sister Judson have been baptized . Judson has since that preached the best sermon upon Baptism , that I ever heard on the subject , which we intend to print. * I yesterday heard that brother Rice had also fully made up his mind upon baptism . " As none of us had conversed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency towards believers ' baptism , I inquired of him what had occasioned the change . He told me , that on the voyage he had thought much about the circumstances that he was coming to Serampore , where all were Baptists ; that he should , in all probability , have occasion to defend infant sprinkling among us ; and that , in consequence , he set himself to examine into the grounds of Pedobaptism . This ended in a conviction , that it has no foundation in the Word of God and occasioned a revolution in his sentiments , which was nearly complete before he arrived in India . He mentioned his doubts and convictions to Mrs. J. which operated to her conviction also , and they were both of them publicly baptized at Calcutta . I expect , however that he will give the account of this change in an appendix to his sermon , which will , of course , be more correct than my stat ment . " Brother Rice was , on the voyage , thought by our brethren to be the most obstinate friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not tell what has led to this change of sentiment , nor had I any suspicion of it , till one morning , when he came before I was up , to examine my Greek Testament : from some questions which he asked thai morning , I began to suspect that he was inquiring ; but I yesterday heard that he was decidedly on the side of believers ' baptism , I expect , therefore , that he will soon be baptized/ ' * Three editions of this Sermon have been published in Boston . /q/ These extracts have been made , for the purpose of sUeno ing forever the imputation of unworthy motives , which some persons have attributed to these Missionaries . If a change of opinion was ever made deliberately and conscientiously , it was this . Every possible motive but the fear of God and the love of truth , impelled them in the opposite direction . The difficulties of their situation were greatly increased by their change of sentiment . Their connection with the American Board of Commissioners , they considered as dissolved . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not be sure that their Baptist brethren would aid them . They could not stay in Hindostan , and yet they resolved to devote themselves to missionary labors , if any position could be found , where they might stay and toil . At one time , they thought it expedient to attempt a mission in South America ; and Mr. Judson commenced the study of the Portuguese language . Japan , Persia , Madagascar , and other countries , were thought of , as fields for missionary efforts . Mr. Judson had long regarded Burmah as the most desirable station ; but it seemed inexpedient , at that time , to attempt to ei tablish a mission there . The following extract of a letter from Mrs. Judson , dated Calcutta , September 19 , will show in what light the design was regarded , and will increase the evidence which many other events afford , that a special providence conducted them to Rangoon , contrary to their expectations , and to all apparent probabilities /z/ * ' We had almost concluded to go to the Burman empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English and the Burman government . If these difficulties are settled , I think it probable we shall go there . It presents a very extensive field for usefulness , containing seventeen millions of inhabitants ;  --  and the Scriptures have never been translated into their language . This circumstance is a very strong inducement to Mr. Judson to go there , as there is no other place where he could be equally useful in translating . But our privations and dangers would be great . There , are no bread , potatoes , butter , and very little animal food . The natives live principally on rice and fish . I should have no society at all , except Mr. J. for there is not an English female in all Rangoon , Bat I could easily give up these comforts , if the government was such as to secure safety to its subjects .

Notwithstanding these difficulties , we are perfectly willing to go , if Providence opens the way . Mr. Jttdaon has written to Mr. Chater , at Ceylon , to get all the information respecting that place he can . Felix Carey has lately arrived from Rangoon , and wishes us to return with him , as he is entirely alone , there being no other Mis* sionary in all Burmah . Mr. Judson and myself enjoy per  - -  feet health , and yet this is the most fatal month in the year , and is considered more sickly this year , than many years before . All our brethren have been sick with fevers , but are getting better . Why we are thus distinguished with such uncommon health , we know not , but can only ascribe it to the sovereign mercy of our Heavenly Father . We are still at Mr. Holt 's , in Calcutta , where we are treated with the greatest kindness . I hope these favors will not induce us to forget our great object , or make us less engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. J. and myself spend the greater part of our time alone , and endeavor to realize the greatness of the work in which we have engaged  --  our dependence on God for success and direction-*  --  and the shortness and uncer* tainty of life . " The following letter to her parents shows that they were still " perplexed , but not in despair  --  persecuted , but not forsaken . " " Calcutta , Oct. 9 , 1812. ' * My dear and honored Parents , " I know you wish to hear from us every opportunity ; and to hear of our continued prosperity will afford you peculiar pleasure . When we reflect on the goodness and mercy of our Heavenly Father to us since we left our native land , we are filled with wonder and gratitude , and feel the obligations these distinguished favors lay us under , of renewedly devoting ourselves to his service . We view his hand in ieadtBg us by a way we knew not , and in raising us up friends where we had no reason to expect them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and friends , he has given us a home here in a land of strangers , and friends who are kind and sympathizing . If he has presented dark and gloomy prospects , and for a time hedged up oar /q/ &y_; yt he has enabled us to trust him in the dark , to feel our entire dependence on him , and lean on him for direction and support . . We are still at Mr. Rolt 's , in Calcutta , where we receive every attention we can wish . Although we are so comfortable here , and have every thing we wish , yet we long to get away to the place where we shall labor among the heathen . Mr. Judson is making daily exertions to get away . We have at present some prospect of going to Java . It presents a wide field for missionary labors , and no Missionary is there . We have spoken for a passage ; and unless some new prospects open of getting into the Burman empire , it is probable we shall go to Java , if government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , and constant additions are making to the churches . As many as twenty have been added to the Baptist church in Calcutta , since we have been here . I heard the relations of four native women before the church , a short time since , which were very interesting . They were converted by the means of a native who is a preacher , and has been the means of converting a great number . Last Sabbath I communed with this church , which is composed of Europeans , Armenians , Hindoos , Portuguese , and a class of people called half-cast , on account of one of their parents being a European , the other a Hindoo . I could not but be affected to see so many which , were called emphatically from the * highways and hedges , ' commemorating the dying love of Christ in a heathen land .

" They accordingly , " says Mrs. Judson , * " issued a most peremptory order for our being sent immediately on board /z/ // one of the Honorable Company 's vessels , bound to England . A petty officer accompanied Messrs . Rice and Judfion to their place of residence , and requested them not to leave it without permission . We saw our names inserted in the public papers as passengers on board a certain ship , and now there appeared very little hope of our escape . Mr. Rice and Mr. Judson , however , soon ascertained that a ship would sail for the Isle of France , in two day &; They applied for a pass from the chief magistrate , but were refused .

The next morning the ship sailed . She had proceeded down the river for two days , when a government despatch arrived , forbidding the pilot to go farther , as passengers were on board who had been ordered to England .

The Captain said that I , and our baggage , could stay on board with perfect safety , even should an officer be sent to search the vessel . The next day we lay at anchor , expecting every hour to hear some intelligence from Calcutta . In the evening , the Captain received a note from the owner of the vessel , saying he had been at the Police to inquire the cause of the detention of his ship ; and the cause assigned was , ' it was suspected there were persons on board which the Captain had been forbidden to receive , ' and that the ship could not /z/ /q/ proceed , until it was ascertained that no such persons were on board . The pilot immediately wrote a certificate that no such persons were on board , at the same time giving a list of all the passengers . I got into a small boat and went on shore , where the brethren had been anxiously waiting through the day . We knew not what course to take , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ship , without a pass from the magistrate . Brother Rice set out directly for Calcutta , to see if it was possible to get a pass , or do any thing else . We spent the night and the next day at the tavern , without hearing any thing from the ship , fearing that every European we saw was in search of us . Brother Rice returned from Calcutta , but had effected nothing . The owner of the vessel was highly offended at his ship 's being detained so long on our account , and would do nothing more to assist us . We felt our situation was peculiarly trying , and could see no end to our difficulties . " Early the next morning we received a note from the Captain , saying he had liberty to proceed , but we must take our baggage from the vessel . We thought it not safe to continue at the tavern where we were , neither could we think of returning to Calcutta . But one way was left  --  to go down the river about sixteen miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board to see about our baggage , as the brethren did not think it safe for them to go . As we could get no boat at the place where we were , I requested the Captain to let our things remain until the vessel reached the other tavern , where I would try to get a boat . He consented , and told me I had better go in the vessel , as it would be unpleasant going so far in a small boat . I was obliged to go on shore again , to inform the brethren of this , and know what they would do . Brother Rice set out again for Calcutta , to try to get a passage to Ceylon , in a ship which was anchored near the place we were going to . Mr. J. took a small boat in which was a small part of our baggage , to go down the river , while I got into the pilot 's boat , which he had sent on shore with me , to go to the ship . As I had been some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel had gone down some distance . Imagine how uncomfortable my situation . In a little boat rowed by six natives , entirely alone , the river very rough , in consequence of the wind ; without an umbrella or any thing to screen me from the sun , which was very hot . The natives hoisted a large sail , which every now and then would almost tip ths boat on one side . I manifested some fear to them , and to /z/ comfort me , they would constantly repeat , Cutcha pho annah sahib , cutcha pho annah . ' The meaning , Never fear , madam , never fear . After some time we came up with the ship , where I put our things in order to be taken out in an hour or two . When we came opposite the tavern , the pilot kindly lent me his boat and servant to go on shore . I immediately procured a large boat to send to the ship , for our baggage . I entered the tavern , a stranger a /einahy and unprotected . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my disconsolate situation . I had nothing with me but a few rupees . I did not know that the boat which I sent after the vessel would overtake it , and if it did , whether it would ever return with our baggage ; neither did I know where Mr. J. was , or when he would come , or with what treatment 1 should meet at the tavern . 1 thought of homey and said to myself . These are some of the many trials attendant on a missionary life , and which I had anticipated . ** In a few hours Mr. Judson arrived , and toward nighty our baggage . We had now given up all hope of going to the Isle of France , and concluded either to return to Calcutta , or to communicate our real situation to the tavern keeper , and request him to assist us . As we thought the latter preferable , Mr. J. told our landlord our circumstances , and asked him if he could assist in getting us a passage to Ceylon . He said a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was Captain of a vessel bound to Madras , and who , he did not doubt , would take us . This raised our sinking hopes . We wait ed two days ; and on the third , which was Sabbath , the ship came in sight , and anchored directly before the house . We now expected the time of our deliverance had come . The tavern keeper went on board to see the Captain for us ; but our hopes were again dashed , when he returned and said the Captain could not take us . We determined , however , to see the Captain ourselves , and endeavor to persuade him to let us have a passage at any rate . We had just sat down to supper , when a letter was handed us . We hastily opened it , and , to our great surprise and joy , in it was a pass from the magistrate , for us to go on board the Creole , the vessel we had left . Who procured this pass for us , or in what way , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , and wonder . But we had every reason to expect the Creole had got out to sea , as it was three days since we left her . There was a possibility , however , of her /q/ having anchored at Saugur , seventy miles from where we then were . We had let our baggage continue in the boat into which it was first taken , therefore it was all in readiness ; and after dark , we all three got into the same boat , and set out against the tide , for Saugur . It was a roost dreary night to me ; but Mr. J. slept the greater part of the night . The next day we had a favorable wind , and before night reached Saugur , where were many ships at anchor , and among the rest we had the happiness to find the Creole . She had been anchored there two days , waiting for some of the ship 's crew . I never enjoyed a sweeter moment in my life , than that when I was sure we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such anxiety , it was a very great relief to find ourselves safe on board the vessel in which we first embarked . All of us are now attending to the French language , as that is spoken altogether at the Isle of France . Though it has pleased our heavenly Father lightly to afilict us , yet he has supported and delivered us from our trials ; which still encourages us to trust in him . " In her private journal , Mrs. J. thus records her feelings , at this time : ** Dec , 20 . Have enjoyed religion very little , since I came on board this vessel . In secret prayer , I am so much troubled with vain and wandering thoughts , and have so little sense of the divine presence , and so little enjoyment of God , that I know I am making no advances in preparation for usefulness among the heathen . Yet in my dullest frames , the idea of finding myself in the midst of them at last , encourages me to hope , that God will finally make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls . " 22 . This day closes the twenty-third year of my life . I have been reflecting on the many favors I have received , and the ingratitude of which I have been guilty the past year ; and my heart has been uncommonly affected by the review . In the course of the past year , I have assumed a new name , and new relative duties  --  lefl my father 's house , the circle of my dear friends , my beloved native land  - -  and have been safely conducted across the ocean . In these events , I. would acknowledge the kind hand of my heavenly Father . In changing my name , he has allowed me to take the name of one , who loves the cause of Christ , and makes the promotion of it the business of his life  --  one , who is , in /z/ every respect , the most calculated to make me happy and useful , of all the persons I have ever seen . I would also acknowledge the hand of God , in supporting me through the trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage so comfortable and happy . Nor has our heavenly Father forsaken us , in this part of the world , but has raised us up friends in a strange land , has preserved our lives and our health , in an uncongenial climate , has led us to examine the truths of his word , and given us clearer views , than ever before , of the ordinances of his house . He has afflicted us , it is true ; but many favorable circumstances are not to be forgotten . And he is now carrying us to a land , where we have some hope of finding a home for life . When again I reflect on the returns 1 have made for so much kindness , my heart sinks within me . I feel that I have misused all the favors and privileges I have enjoyed , and though never under so great obligation , was never so guilty , so unworthy , so unqualified to serve him . But I renewedly commend myself to his mercy , and implore him to forgive my sins , to cleanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and to him alone . " Dec , 30 . Very light winds for several days . Make slow progress . Shall probably arrive at the Isle of France , in the most dangerous season , when there are frequent hurricanes and storms on the coast . I have been trying to feel willing to die , at any time , and under any circumstances , that God shall appoint . But I find my nature shrinks from the idea of being shipwrecked and sunk amid the waves . This shows me how unlike 1 am to those holy martyrs , who rejoiced to meet death , in the most horrid forms . I have enjoyed religion but little on board this ship , feeling an uncommon degree of sloth fulness and inactivity . Spent some time , last evening , in prayer for awakening and restoring grace . I greatly feel the need of more confidence in God , and reliance on the Saviour , that when danger and death approach , I may composedly resign myself into his hands , and cheerfully wait his will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly six weeks , and are within a week 's sail of the Isle of France . It is a long passage , but we have had contrary winds , and much rough weather . There are four passengers , besides ourselves and the Captain 's wife . None of them in the least seriously inclined . We three have worship twice every Sabbath , and prayers in our room every evening . The other passengers spend their Sabbaths /q/ m deck in playirhg cards and chess , and trifling convem tion . It is very trying to us to see the Sabbath profaned in such a way . But we can not present it . Though they treat us with respect , yet I presume they consider us as superstitious , enthusiastic , unsocial creatures . But we know , it is our great business to serve our heavenly Father , and prepare for usefulness among the heathen . In order to do this , we must take those methods which make us appear contemptible in the eyes of the men of this world . We continue to attend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jan. 17 .

Could not this infant Mission be shielded from thy shafts ? But thou hast only executed the commission of a higher power . Though thou hast come , clothed in thy usual garb , thou wast sent by a kind Father to release his child from toil and pain . Be still , then , my heart , and know that God has done it .

" Soon after they left Calcutta , in consequence of contrary winds and storms , the vessel was found to be in a leaky , sinking condition , which obliged them to put into Choringa to repair . Before the vessel got in , Harriet was seized with the bowel complaint , which was extremely distressing in her situation . She however was considerably recovered before they put to sea again , and was in hopes of getting to the Isle of France before she was confined . * The Isle of France is situated in the Indian Ocean , in fifty-eight degrees twenty-seven mintUes east longitude , and twenty degrees south latitude . It is about thirty-three miles long , and twenty-four broad from east to west . It was captured from the French by the English , who still retain possefision of it . /z/ But they again had contrary winds , which made their passage so much longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was safely and very comfortably delivered of a little girl , a fortnight before the vessel arrived . She was much better for a few days than she had been for weeks before ; and the child was perfectly well , and appeared as likely to live as any child . In a few days a storm came on ; and as she and the infant were much exposed to the wet weather , they both took cold , which speedily terminated the life of the infant , and threw Harriet into a consumption , of which she died , on the 30th of November . She thought herself in a consumption from the first of her illness , and endeavored to be prepared to meet the king of terrors . She had her reason perfectly to the last moment of her life . She felt no fear of death , but longed for its approach . The day before she died , her physician told her she would not continue another day . She lifted up her hands , and exclaimed , ' O glorious intelligence . ' She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him messages to her friends with the greatest composure . She frequently mentioned in her sickness , that she had never repented leaving her native country , and that the consideration of having left it for the cause of Christ , now afforded her great consolation . She died in a happy , composed frame , without a struggle or a groan . Her body now lies , solitary and alone , in yonder heathy ground . No marble monument* is erected to speak her worth , no common gravestone to tell the passing stranger , ' Here lie the remains of one , who , for the love of Christ and immortal souls , lefl the bosom of her friends , and found an early grave in a land of strangers . ' But angels will watch her dust , even in this benighted land ; and at the resurrection of the just , it will be reunited to her immortal spirit , which , no doubt , is now in the full enjoyment of her God .

I am willing , I should be thankful Co live longer on his account , and for the sake also of laboring among the heathen . But the kind of life I lead induces me to look at the grave with more composure than I otherwise should do , and appreciate the worth of that religion which can make us happy when stripped of earthly comforts  --  and happier still , in view of the eternal world . " Mr. J. has gone to preach to the soldiers , and brother Rice to conduct worship in the hospital ; so that being quite alone , I have sought and enjoyed a precious season of prayer and communion with God . O for a closer walk with God , and more fervor in the performance of religious duties . O that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Redeemer. * Feb. 12 . Some religious enjoyment , but guilty of much stupidity , hardness of heart , and wandering thoughts . Have felt some longing desires to be free from sin , and present with the Saviour . Formerly , I was very desirous of living a long life  --  death generally appeared as the king of terrors . But of late , I have wished that my pilgrimage would soon terminate , and death and the grave have worn an inviting appearance . This change of feeling is not occasioned by any present distress or discontent with life , for my days are tranquil and happy . Perhaps these new desires are a prelude to my speedy departure from this world . O should this be the case , may I , in this solemn transporting hour , adopt these lines of Watts :  --  - * Joyful , with all the strength I have . My quivering lips shall sing , Where is thy boasted vlct'ry , grave ? And whei% 's the monster 's sting ? ' ' ' 28 . Had a special season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewail the depravity of my heart /z/ Had some faint views of the infinite excellence of God , which caused me to mourn that I sin so much against him , and to long for strength to vanquish my spiritual foes . Felt happy that God reigns ; that he has a church in this world , on which he has set his love , having redeemed it with the blood of his own dear Son . But O how seldom do I get near to God , or have any sense of divine things . At what a poor , low rate I live . If a Christian , surely I am the least , the vilest , entirely unworthy the notice of an infinite God . Yet Jesus can be honored in the salvation of one so mean , so unworthy . Divine grace will be more conspicuous , than in the salvation of those , who have less to be forgiven . I will still hope in thy mercy , O infinite Redeemer  --  that thou wilt enable me to persevere in thy service , and finally save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am alone , as usual , on the Sabbath .

O that I might live a more holy life ! I would be more watchful , more prayerful , more willing to deny myself , that I may live near to God ; but in my own strength , I can do nothing . If Jesus is pleased to strengthen me , and give me a spirit of perseverance , it will be easy for me to keep his commandments . But if not , I shall wither and die ; I shall give up the contest , and my sins will come off conquerors . O Jesus , prevent it . My sins are thine enemies , as well as mine . Let them not triumph over one who humbly dares to hope that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee . Thou wilt not , O my Saviour , desert me at last . Thou knowest I have left my native land , and the comforts of social life , from desire to serve thee , and comply with the clear dictates of duty . And now when I have but few comforts lefl , O give me the enjoyment of thy presence . Give me thyself , and I ask no more . I will be satisfied with this as my portion in life , and my eternal portion beyond the grave . " It was thought expedient that Mr. Rice should return to America , for the purpose of exciting the attention of the Baptist churches in this country . He accordingly sailed for the United States , in March , 1813 , He was welcomed op /q/ his arrival ith great affectiob , and was successful , in a very short time , in awakening such a spirit of missionary exertion in the Baptist churches , that a large number of Missionary Societies were formed in various parts of the country ; and in April , 1814 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the first acts of the Convention was to appoint Mr. and Mrs. Judson as their Missionaries , leaving it to their discretion to select a field of labor .

We will now resume our extracts from Mrs. J. 's journal : * ' March 13 . Brother Rice has just left us , and taken passage for America . Mr. J. and I are now entirely alone ; not one remaining friend in this part of the world . The scenes through which we pass are calculated to remind us that this world is not our home , and that we are fast verging towards the grave .

" The affecting incident related in the following letter , exemplifies the warmth of her benevolence , and the energy of her character : To her Sisters . " Lk of France  --  Port Louis , March 12 , 1813. ** A circumstance took place this evening , the recital of which , I think , will interest your feelings , and which greatly /q/ encourages me to plead the cause of humanity whenever an opportunity offers . Last night I heard a considerable noise in the yard in which we live , connected with another family . We went to the door , and saw a female slave with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a club , in a most dreadful manner . My blood ran cold within me , and I could quietly see it no longer . I went up to the mistress , and in broken French , asked her to stop , and what her servant had done . She immediately stopped , and told me that her servant was very bad , and had lately run away . I talked with her , till her anger appeared to be abated , and she concluded her punishment with flinging the club she had in her hands , at the poor creature 's head , which made the blood run down on her garment . The slave continued with her hands tied behind her all night . They were untied this morning , and she spent the day in labor , which made me conclude she would be punished no more . But this evening , I saw a large chain brought into the yard , with a ring at one end , just large enough to go round her neck . On this ring were fixed two pieces of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would come on each side of her face to prevent her eating . The chain was as large and heavy as an ox chain , and reached from her neck to the ground . The ring was fastened with a lock and key . The poor creature stood trembling while they were preparing to put the chain on her . The mistress ' rage again kindled at seeing her , and she began beating her again , as the night before . I went to her again , and begged she would stop . She did , but so full of anger that she ( uld hardly speak . When she had becon ) e a little calm , I asked her if she could not forgive her servant . I told her that her servant was very bad , but that she would be very good to forgive her . She made me to understand that she would forgive her , because / had asked her ; but she would not have her servant to think it was out of any favor to her . She told her slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The slave came , knelt and kissed my feet , and said , " Mercy , madam ,  --  mercy , madam , " meaning . Thank you , madam . I could scarcely forbear weeping at her gratitude . The mistress promised me the chain should not be put on her , and ordered it carried away . I have felt very happy this evening , that this poor slave can lie down and sleep , without that heavy chain . But O , my dear sisters , how much more wretched /z/ is the spiritual than the temporal state of these slaves . They have none to tell them of their danger , none to lead them to that Saviour , who is equally the friend of the slave and the master . ** We have sometimes thought of staying on this island , as Missionaries are really needed here . But when we compare this population with many other places which are equally needy , we can not feel justified in staying here . The Governor of this island would patronize a mission , and would be pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rice have preached every Sabbath to the English soldiers . We long to get to the place where we shall spend the remainder of our lives in instructing the heathen . I want one of you with me very much , as I am entirely alone .

I often look at death with very animating feelings . Then I hope to meet all my friends , to be no more separated . Let us , my sisters , live near to God , and make it our only business to promote his glory .

We shall probably meet with great difficulties and trials ; und we know not to what part of the world we shall have next to direct our course . Every thing respecting our little mission is involved in uncertainty . - I find it hard to live by faith , and confide entirely in God , when the way is dark before me . But if the way were plain and easy , where would be the room for confidence in God ? Instead , then , of murmuring and complaining , let me rejoice and be thankful that my heavenly Father compels me to trust in him , by removing those things , on which we are naturally inclined to lean . I daily feel my unfitness for the great work , which I have undertaken , and hope that God is making use of these trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O , if our /q/ trials may be then sanctified , we will rejoice ; nor in all thy chastisements , O blessed Jesus , will we wish to have the rod removed , until thou hast effectually subdued us to thyself . " Among the English soldiers on the island , was one pious man , who became very strongly attached to the Missionaries . His piety and his zeal for the welfare of his fellow soldiers furnish an instructive example to other Christians . Mrs. J. thus describes him : " His first appearance was solemn , humble , and unassuming ; and such we have ever found him . He told us he was a member of a church that had been formed in one of the regiments by the Missionaries at Serampore , and that that regiment was now on Bourbon , a neighboring island , but he had been sent to this island on business . Though he is an illiterate man , and has had but few advantages , yet he converses on the distinguishing doctrines of the Gospel with a sense and propriety which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Judson made inquiries of him respecting the religious state of the soldiers in this place , and whether opportunity could be had of preaching to them . He informed him that he knew of but one pious soldier in either of the regiments on this island , and that there could be no possibility of preaching to them , unless a private room could be procured for the purpose . He immediately made every exertion to hire a room , and at last succeeded ; but was obliged to give eight dollars a month , which he has paid out of his own private property , that his fellow soldiers might have opportunity to hear the Gospel . This soldier has visited us almost every day for two months past , and we have seldom found him inclined to converse on any other subject besides experimental religion . Though his income is very small , and he has a family to support , yet he has given us , since we have been here , the value of twenty dollars . We have frequently observed that we have seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any other , as we have in the conversation and prayers of this man ; and we doubt not , though his situation in life is low , but he will shine in heaven , as a star of the first magnitude . " After long deliberation as to the course which they should pursue in their present embarrassing and unforeseen condition , Mr. and Mrs. Judson resolved to attempt a mis* // sion at Penang , or Prince of Wales ' Island , situated on the coast of Malacca , and inhabited by Malays . As no passage to that island could be obtained from the Isle of France , they resolved to visit Madras , with the hope of obtaining a passage thence to Penang . They accordingly sailed for Madras , in May , 1813 . They had a pleasant passage . Mrs. J. 's journal contains this memorandum during the voyage : ' ' June 1 . Just passing the island of Ceylon , and expect to reach Madras in three days . I have this day renewedly given myself to God , to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am but an empty vessel , which must be cleansed and filled with grace , or remain forever empty , forever useless . If ever such a poor creature as I am does any good , it will be entirely owing to the sovereign grace of God , to his own self-moving goodness , inclining him to give grace to one so depraved , so unworthy as I am . " The Missionaries arrived at Madras in June. * They were kindly received and entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Loveless , English Missionaries stationed there , and by other friends of Christ in that city . But here they were disappointed . No passage for Penang could be procured . Fearful that the English government in Bengal would , on learning their arrival , send them to England , they resolved to take passage in a vessel bound to Rangoon . Accordingly after a stay at Madras of a few days , they sailed for Rangoon . Thus by a wonderful series of providential occurrences , they were impelled , contrary to their expectations and plans , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Though our trials may be great , and our privations many and severe , yet the presence of Jesus can make us happy , and the consciousness that we have sacrificed all for his dear cause , and are endeavoring to labor for the salvation of immortal souls , will enable us to bear our privations and trials , with some degree of satisfaction and delight . The poor Burmans are entirely destitute of those consolations and joys which constitute our happiness ; and why should we be unwilling to part with a few fleeting , inconsiderable comforts , for the sake of making them sharers with us in joys exalted as heaven , durable as eternity I We can not expect to do much in such a rough , uncultivated field ; yet if we may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way for others , it will be a sufficient reward .

The vessel was old , and was in imminent peril of shipwreck ; but by the blessing of God , the Missionaries , in July , 1813 , arrived safely at Rangoon , the place where their Saviour had designed they should labor for him many years , and where they were to be the instruments of gathering a little church of redeemed Burmans . They were guided hither by the special providence of God . No one , who reviews the series of occurrences from the time of their arrival in Calcutta , can doubt that God was preparing the way for establishing the Burman Mission , and for summoning the American Baptist churches to the holy labors and pleasures of the missionary enterprise .

JUDsoir. 8T /z/ Sketch of the Geography , History , Religion , Languiigt 4*c. of the Burman Empire , The Barman empiie is situated in that part of the con tilient of Asia , lying between Hindostan and China , and so ' far partaking of the characteristics of each , as to be properly designated by the compound epithet , ChinIndia , which Malte-Bron , the geographer , has bestowed on it . Previously to the recent war between the British and the fiarmans , the empire included the kingdom of Ava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the west ; Lowashan and Yunshan , on the east ; and Pegu , Martaban , Tenasserim , Mergui , Tavoy , and Junkseylon , on the south . It covered a space between the ninth and twenty-sixth degrees of north latitude , and between the ninety-second and one hundred and second of east longitude , being about one thousand and fifty geographical miles in length , and six hundred in breadth . It probably contained one hundred and ninety-four thousand square miles . By the late treaty , the British retain the n-ovince of Arracan , on the west ; and on the south , Yeh , Tavoy and Mergui , and Tenasserim , with the islands and dependencies , taking the Sal wen river as the line of demarkation on that frontier . These cessions have very considerably diminished the extent and the power of the Burman empire , as may be seen by an inspection of the map ; but the precise limits of the portions lost and retained are not sufficiently known to enable us to state them with imich accuracy . Nor is it important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for missionary effort is not changed by these political events , though greater facilities are afforded by this extension of the British sway . History .  --  The history of the Burman empire resembles that of all other oriental nations . It is a melancholy detail of usurpations and conquests , of sanguinary wars between rival chiefs , and of the subjection of many petty states to the ambition and tyranny of one mcM'e powerful kingdom . Ava Proper is the original state , which has successively subdued the other provinces which compose the empire . Ava was itself at one time sabject to the King of Pegu ; but in the sixteenth century its numerous and warlike inhabitants revolted , and obtained possession of the provinces of Ava and Martaban . Malte-Brun says : /z/ " The Burmans continued masters of the country till 1740 , when a civil war broke out in consequence of a revolt in the conquered provinces of Pegu , and was prosecuted on both sides with savage ferocity . In 1750 and 1751 , the Peguans , with the aid of arms imported by Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beat their rivals , and in 1752 , Ava , the capital , surrendered to them at discretion . Dweepdee , the last of a long line of Burman Kings , was taken prisoner , with all his family , except two sons , who escaped into Siam . Binga Delia , King of Pegu , returned to his hereditary dominions , leaving the government of Ava to his son Apporasa . When the conquest appeared complete and settled , one of those extraordinary characters which Providence sometimes raises up to change the destinies of nations , now appeared . This was a Burman , called Alompra , a man of obscure birth , known by the name of the huntsman , ' and the chief of Manchaboo , then a poor village . Having collected around him one hundred picked men , he defeated the Peguan detachments in small skirmishes . Improving in experience , and acquiring confidence in his own strength , he attracted more numerous followers ; and in the autumn of 1753 , suddenly advanced , and obtained possession of Ava . Defeating the King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories , and in three months took his capital , which he gave up to indiscriminate plunder and carnage . Having sustained some indignities from the Siamese , he invaded Siam ; but , during the seige of the metropolis of that kingdom , his career of conquest was suddenly terminated in 1760 by a fatal disease , in the fiflieth year of his age , and ninth of his reign . Alompra was succeeded by his son Namdojee Praw , a minor . Shembuan , the uncle of this prince , brother to Alompra , acted as regent , and , on the death of his nephew , assumed the crown . Shembuan declared war against the Siamese , and took their capital in 1766 , but did not retain permanent possession of that country . In 1767 the empire was invaded by a Chinese army , 50,000 strong , on the side of Yunnan , which advanced as far as a village called Chiboo ; but the Burmans cut off their supplies , and then destroyed the whole of them , except 2500 , who were settt in fetters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective trades , and encouraged to marry Burman ' Wives , and become naturalized subjects . Shembuan sub dued Cassay in 1774 , and died in 1776 . His son and sucies8or , Chenguza , a debauched and bloody tyrant , was d /q/ throned and pat to death in 1782 , in a conspiracy headed by his own uncle , Minderagee , who took possession of the government . This prince was the fourth son of Alompra . In 1783 he sent a fleet of boats against Arracan , which he easily conquered . He then marched against Siam , where he met with some checks ; and , finding himself unable to retain possession of the interior , was obliged to content himself with the dominion of its western coast , as far south as Mergui , including the two important sea ports of Tavoy and Mergui , which were ceded to him by a treaty of peace in 1793 . ' ' In 1795 his Burman Majesty marched an army of 5000 men into the English province of Chittagong , holding an army of 20,000 in readiness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three notorious robbers , who had taken refuge in that country . This force was confronted by a strong detachment from Calcutta . The affair was amicably adjusted by the delivery of the refugees , whose enormous guilt was established , and the Burmans withdrew without commitiing any disorders . In June , 1819 , Minderagee Praw died , and was succeeded by his grandson . The junior branches of the family revolted , and scenes of massa ere ensued . " * PopulaHon. - lt is impossible to make a statement with any pretensions to accuracy , relative to the population of countries little known to foreigners , where no regular census is published , and where the pride of the government and people inclines them to exaggerate their numbers and power . The population of Burmah was estimated by Colonel Symes , in 1795 , at seventeen millions ; by Captain Cox , in 1800 , at no more than eight millions ; and Captain Canning , in 1810 , believed that this estimate exceeded the truth . Snodgrass , in his Burmese War , published in 1827 , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this term , the whole empire ) has been greatly overrated by travellers , their accounts being founded on the thickly peopled banks of the rivers , or drawn from the natives , who have ted their numbers beyond the truth . ' There can be no doubt , however , that the empire contains several millions of immortal beings , who have no hope , and are without God in the world . Climate , c ,  --  " Though this empire , " says Malte-Brun , " extends into the torrid zone , it enjoys a temperate climate , /z/ of the elevatinn of its territory .

There are , near Amarapora , quarries which yield marble equal to the finest in Italy . It is monopolized by the government , and consecrated to the making of images of Gaudama . Thkr empire contains celebrated and very productive petroleum wells , which yield a large revenue to government , being retained as a monopoly . " * Char ( uter and Manners of the Inhabitants ,  --  The character of the Burmese is undoubtedly very much aflfected by the nature of their government . They are represented to be indolent , inhospitable , deceitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harassed with vexatious taxes , have no motive to steady industry , ( he fruits of which may be wrested irom them by the government , , or by subordinate civil agents . The distrust which is engeit* dered , and the fears that such a system awakens , prevent hospitality , and make the people cold hearted , unfeeling , and suspicious . The rapacity of the rulers occasions efforts to conceal property , and produces cunning , falsehood , and perjury . Enterprise and genius are checked , because the individual can hope for no personal advantage from his exertions . Under a better government-  --  such as would be produced by the influence of Christianity  --  the character of the Bur mans would , without doubt , become highly respectable . They possess acute minds , and lively imaginations . They are not fierce nor revengeful . Their domestic relations are generally maintained with affection and fidelity . There is no cast ; and social intercourse has no other restraints than those which spring from the nature of their religion and government . Malte-Brun says : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character from the Hindoos . Lively , impatient , active and irascible , they have none of the habitual indolence of the natives of Hindostan , nor are they addicted to that gloomy jealousy which prompts so many eastern nations to immure their females in the solitudes of a harem . The sexes have equally free intercourse as in Europe , but they treat the women as an inferior order of beings . Their testimony in a court of justice is less valued . They are often sold or lent to strangers without blame or scruple . They are much engaged in labor , and , on the whole , faithful to the conjugal tie . The Burmans participate of the Chinese physi- * Malte-Brun , book 11. p. 269. // ognomy . The women , eepecially in the northern parts , are fairer than those of the Hindoos , but less delicately formed . The men are not tall , but active and muscular .

Polygamy is prohibited , but concubinage is admitted without limitation . The bodies of the dead are buried . They are less delicate and cleanly in their eating than the Hindoos . They kiU no domestic animals , being prohibited by their religion , but make abundant use of game . The lower orders eat lizards , guanas , and snakes . They are very indulgent to the manners and customs of strangers . The sitting posture is reckoned among them the most respectful , though this mark of deference has been mistaken by some strangers , for an expression of insolence . ' ** Manufactures and Commerce ,  --  The Burmans excel in the art of gilding . The capital maintains a considerable commercial intercourse with Yunnan , the nearest province of China . It exports cotton , amber , ivory , rubies , sapphires ,  --  nd betel nuts ; birds , and edible nests , from the Eastern Islands ; and receives in return raw or manufactured silk , velvets , gold-leaf , paper , sweet-meats , and a variety of hardware . By the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rice , salt , and pickled sprats , from the lower provinces , to support the capital and northern districts . Some foreign articles are brought by Arracan , and carried over the mountains by men , but the greater part by the Irrawaddy . Broad cloth , some hard ware , coarse muslins , Cossimbazar silk handkerchiefs , china-ware and glass , are the leading commodities . Some lac , silver and precious stones are exported . In 1795 , the quantity of timber exported to Madras and Calcutta , amounted to a value of 00 , sterling . About 3000 tons of shipping are , in peaceable times , built in this country , and sold in different parts of India . The maritime ports of this empire are more commodiously situated than those of any other power , particularly the harbour of Negrais . The currency consists of silver , bullion and lead , in small pieces ; as the Burmans , like the Chinese , have no coin .

The sovereign acknowledges no equal . The punctilios of ceremony are numerous , and rigidly followed ; and the utmost guardedness is observed in any diplomatic intercourse with foreign states . The manners of the great are often pleasing , but they are crafty ; and the tenures by which they hold their offices render them rapacious . Obliged to give large presents to the King , they have recourse to extortion , speculations in trade , and almost universal monopoly . Great vicissitudes of fortune are occasioned by royal caprice. " * Religion ,  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This religion is spread over the Burman empire , Siam , Ceylon , Japan , Cochin-China , and the greater part of China Proper . It has been contended , that it was also the ancient religion of Hindostan itself , and that the prevailing brahmiuical superstitions were the invention of later times . It is indeed probable , that all the idolatrous systems of religion , which have ever existed in the world , have had a common origin , and have been modified by the different fancies and corruptions of different nations . The essence of idolatry is every where the same . It is every where * ' abominable " in its principles and its rites , and every where the cause of indescribable and manifold wretchedness . It is asserted by Mr. Ward , that two of the six schools of philosophy which once flourished among the Hindoos , taught the same atheistical principles as the disciples of Boodh now maintain ; and it is indisputable , that thiese two sects were numerous before the appearance of Boodh . This personage is said in Burman books to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have been born about the year 600 before Christ . He is supposed to have adopted the atheistical system of these sects , and his principles were espoused and maintained by the successive moaarchs of his family , who are charged by the Brahmins with the crime of destroying their religion , and substituting atheism . At length , however , the Brahmins obtained the ascendency , and arming themselves with the civil power , thej so effectually purified Hindostan from the offensive heresy , that scarcely a vestige of the Bood- * Malte-Bnin , book 11. p. 275. /q/ hist superstition is now to be traced in that country . It found a refuge in Ceylon , and neighboring regions ; and the most learned Burmans assert , that it was introduced into that empire , about four hundred and fifty years after the death of Boodh , or ( as he is more commonly called ) Gandama . The Boodhists believe , that , like the Hindoo Vishnoo , Boodh has had ten incarnations , which are described in the Jatus , amounting , it is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary statement of the principles of Boodhism is copied from the valuable work of Mr. Ward on the History , Literature , and Religion of the Hindoos : " The Boodhists do not believe in a First Cause ; they consider matter as eternal ; that every portion of animated existence has in itself its own rise , tendency and destiny ; that the condition of creatures on earth , is regulated by works of merit and demerit ; that works of merit not only raise individuals to happiness , but as they prevail , raise the world itself to prosperity ; while on the other hand , when vice is predominant , the world degenerates , till the universe itself is dissolved . They suppose , however , that there is always some superior deity , who has attained to this elevation by religious merit ; but they do not regard him as the governor of the world . To the present grand period , comprehending all the time included in a kulpu , they assign five deities , four of whom have already appeared , including Gaudama or Boodh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred and fiftysix of which had expired A. D. 1814 . After the expiration of the five thousand years , another saint will obtain the ascendency , and be deified . Six hundred millions of saints are said to be canonized with each deity , though it is admitted that Boodh took only twenty-four thousand devotees to heaven with htm . " The lowest state of existence is in hell ; the next , is that in the form of brutes ; both these ate states of punishment . The next ascent is to that of man , which is probationary . The next includes many degrees of honor and happiness up to demi-gods , &c.; which are states of reward for works of merit . The ascent to superior deity is from the state of man . " The Boodhists are taught , that there are four superior heavens , which are not destroyed at the end of a kulpu ; that below these there are twelve other heavens , followed by six inferior heavens ; after which follows the earth , then /z/ the world of snakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added one hundred and twenty hells of milder torments. ' * The highest state of glory is absorption . The person who is unchangeable in his resolution , who has obtained a knowledge of things past , present , and to come , through one kulpu , who can make himself invisible , and go where he pleases , and who has attained to complete abstraction , will enjoy absorption. * ' ' Those who perform works of merit , are admitted to the heavens of the different gods , or are made kings , or great men on earth ; and those who are wicked , are born in the forms of different animals , or consigned to different hells . The happiness of these heavens is wholly sensual . ** The Boodhists believe , that at the end of a kulpu , the universe is destroyed . To convey some idea of the extent of this period , the illiterate Cingalese use this comparison ; if a man were to ascend a mountain nine miles high , and to renew these journies once in every hundred years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atom , the time required to do this , would be nothing to the fourth part of a kulpu. * ' Boodh , before his exaltation , taught his followers , that after his ascent , the remains of his body , his doctrine , or an assembly of his disciples , wet-e to be held in equal reverence with himself . When a Cingalese , therefore , approaches an image of Boodh , he says , ' I take refuge in Boodh ; I take refuge in his doctrine ; I take refuge in his followers . ' ** There are five commands delivered to the common Boodhists ; the first forbids the destruction of animal life ; the second forbids theft ; the third adultery ; the fourth falsehood ; the fiflh the use of spirituous liquors . There are other commands for the superior classes , or devotees , which forbid dancing , songs , music , festivals , perfumes , elegant dresses , elevated seats , &c.; Among works of the highest merit , one is the feeding of a hungry infirm tiger with a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that the soul is received into the divine essence ; but as the Boodhists reject the doctrine of a separate Supreme Spirit , it is difficult to say what are their ideas of absorption . Dr. Buchanan says , ( A. Researches , vol. vi . p. 180 ) Nigban ** implies ( that is , among the Burmans ) exemption from all the miseries incident to humanity , but by no means annihilation , * ' /q/ ** The temples erected in honor of Boodh , * in the Barman empire , are of various sizes and forms , as quadrangular , pentagonal , hexagonal , heptagonal , or octagonal . Those of a round spiral form can be erected only by the King , or by persons high in office . An elevated spot is preferred for the erection of these edifices ; but where such an elevation can not be found , the building is erected upon the second , third , fourth , fiflh and sixth terrace . " The priests worship at the temples daily , or ought to do so . The worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; repeating certain prayers . The priest cleanses the temple , preserves the lights , and receives the offerings . A worshipper may present his own offerings , if he is acquainted with the formulas . The five commands are repeated* by a priest twice a day to the people , who stand up and repeat them after him . ' ' Boodh , as seen in many temples , appears seated upon a throne placed on elephants , or encircled by a hydra , or in the habit of a king , accompanied by his attendants . In most of the modern images , however , he js represented in a sitting posture , with his legs folded ; Iflll right hand resting upon his right thigh , and his left upon his lap : a yellow cloth is cast over his left shoulder , which envelopes his right arm . His hair is generally in a curling state , like that of an African ; his ears are long , as though distended by heavy ear-rings . The image is generally placed in the centre of the temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or under a small porch of wood , neatly gilded . Images of celestial attendants , male and female , are frequently placed in front of the image . " It appears evident from their writings , that the ancient religion of the Burmans consisted principally in religious austerities . When a person becomes initiated into the priesthood , he immediately renounces the secular state , lives on alms , and abstains from food after the sun has passed the meridian . The ancient writings of the Burmans mention an order of female priests ; but it is likely that these were only female mendicants . " Priests are forbidden to marry ; they are to live by men dicity ; are to possess only three garments , a begging dish a giridle , a razor , a needle , and a cloth to strain the water which they drink , that they may not devour insects . /z/ ** The . priests reside in houses which are built and o &; fered to them as works of merit . There are numerous colleges , which are built in the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which boys are taught . ' ' The priests are the schoolmasters , and teach gratuitously as a work of merit , the children being maintained at home by their parents . If a priest finds a pupil to be of quick parts , he persuades the parents to make him a priest ; but if a boy wishes to embrace a secular life after he has been some time in the college , he is at liberty to do so . " The Burman feasts are held at the full and change of the moon . At these times all public business is suspended ; the people pay their homage to Gaudama , at the temples , presenting to the image , rice , fruits , flowers , candles , &_c.; Aged people often fast during the whole day . Some visit the colleges , and hear the priests read portions of the Boodhist writings . ** According to the religion of Boodh , there are no distinctions of cast . The Burmans burn their dead with many ceremonies , especially the bodies of the priests . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , atheism ; and the highest reward of piety , the object of earnest desire and unwearied pursuit , is annihilation . How wretched a system is this ; how devoid of adequate motives to virtue ; and how vacant of consolation ! O how must every humane heart , and much more every Christian , desire , that the pure and glorious Gospel may shed its light upon this gross darkness ! Language .  --  The Burman language is peculiar to itself . We can not know what affinity it has to some of the IndoChinese languages , which are not yet investigated ; but it is essentially different from the Sanscrit , the parent of almost all the languages of India Proper , and indeed from every language , that has yet come under the observation of Europeans . This is the common language of the country , for colloquial and other ordinary purposes ; though in some of the provinces other dialects are , to some extent , spoken . It is a very difficult language ; and it cost Mr. Judson , though be possessed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labor of several years , before he was able to speak and write it with ease . His difficalties , however , were peculiarly great , as there were no grammars Dor dictionaries , nor other aids , to facilitate his progress . The character in common use appears to the eye of an American , to be a series of circular marks . Hence it has been called the Round O Language , The following specimen has been engraved for this work . /z/ qwq better executed than those of the Hindoos . Sometimes the J write on plates of gilded sheet iron . In a Burman version of the Lord 's prayer , the Missionaries could scarcely discover three genuine Sanscrit words ; but many syllables are found coinciding with those of the colloquial dialect of the Chinese . A knowledge of letters is very generally diffused . Many read and write the vulgar tongue , though few understand the learned and sacred volumes . The Burman s are fond of poetry and music ; and in the latter , make use of an instrument formed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reed . They possess epic and religious poems of great celebrity , and recite in verse the exploits of their heroes . Colonel Symes was astonished at the number of books contained in the royal library , where the contents of each chest are written on the outside in letters of gold . " * There is , also , a sacred language , called the Pali . It is a dialect of the Sanscrit , and was introduced into Burmah with the religion of Boodh . The sacred books were written in Ceylon , where this form of the Sanscrit had obtained currency , and thence were carried to Buvmah . This language became , of course , the language of religion ; and gradually intermingled many of its words and forms , with the common language . Thus , although the Pali is now a dead language , cultivated by the learned only , some knowledge of it is indispensable to him , who would acquire a perfect knowledge of the Burman , and especially to a Missionary .

It was a wise Providence , which selected , , as the pioneer and founder of the Burman Mission , so thorough a scholar , and so able a philologist , as Mr. Judson . Re has accomplished a service of inestimable utility , by acquiring a familiar acquaintance with the Burman and Pali languages , and preparing a Grammar and a Dictionary , which will render the acquisition of these languages comparatively an easy task to future Missionaries . HskI he done no his life would have yielded rich firuk to 1 Missionary cause . /z/ Establishment of the Mission at Rangoon , Rangoon is the principal seaport of the Burman empire . It is situated thirty miles from the sea , on the Rangoon river , one of the outlets of the Irrawaddy . It lies in sixteen degrees forty-seven minutes north latitude , and ninety-six degrees nine minutes east longitude , and is 670 miles southeast of Calcutta . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the finest for shipping I have ever seen . It is about six hundred yards viide at Rangoon , the water in general deep from shore to shore , the bottom good , and current moderate . " Ships of 800 or 900 tons can come up to the wharves . The town stretches about a mile along the bank of the river , and is not more than a third of a mile broad . In 1795 , it contained 5000 taxable houses . In 1S12 , they had been reduced to 1500 , by fire and bad governmentf The number of inhabitants , in 1813 , was stated by Mr. Judson , to be 40,000 . Some of the inhabitants were of Portuguese extraction , and had two or three churches and priests . The Armenians also had one church . The first Protestant Missionaries who visited Burmah , were Messrs . Chater and Mardon , who went thither from Serampore , in 1807 . Mr. Mardon , after a few months , left the station , and Mr. Chater was joined by Mr. Felix Carey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messrs . Prichett and Brian , from the London Missionary Society , arrived ; but Mr. Brian soon died , and Mr. Prichett , after a year 's residence , removed to Yizagapatam . Mr. Chater remained four years , and made a considerable progress in the language . He translated the Gospel , by Matthew , which was revised by Mr. Carey , and afterwards printed at Serampore . At length Mr. Chater relinquished the mission , and removed to Ceylon . Mr. Carey remained , and was joined by a young man from Calcutta , who soon quitted the station . When Mr. Judson arrived , Mr. Carey had gone to Ava , by order of the King . Thus had every attempt of the English Missionaries failed ; and this fact seems to show still more conclusively , that God reserved * Cox 's Burman Empire , p. 5. f MalteBrun , book 11. p. 273. lOS MEMOIR OF MRS. nWSOJf. for the American Baptist Churches the duty of establishing and sustaining the Burman Mission . Mrs. Carey , who was a native of the country , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chater had erected , in a pleasant rural spot , half a mile from the walls of the town . The house was built of teak wood , and was large and convenient for that climate , though the inside was unfinished , and the beams and joists were naked . Connected with it were gardens enclosed , containing about two acres of ground , and full of fruit trees of various kinds . In this quiet spot Mr. and Mrs. J. found a home , and felt that at last they had reached a place where they could labor for the Saviour . But their situation , even here , was not without trials . Mrs. Judson , in a letter to her parents , dated July 30 , 1813 , says : " We felt very gloomy and dejected the first night we arrived , in view of our prospects ; but we were enabled to lean on God , and to feel that he was able to support us under the most discouraging circumstances . The next morning I prepared to go on shore , but hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as there was no method of conveyance , except a horse , while I was unable to ride . It was , however , concluded that I should be carried in an arm chair ; consequently when I landed , one was provided , through which were put two bamboos , and four of the natives took me on their shoulders . When they had carried me a little way into the town , they set me down under a shade , when great numbers of the natives gathered around , as they had seldom seen an English female . Being sick and weak , I held my head down , which induced many of the native females to come very near , and look under my bonnet . At this I looked up and smiled , at which they set up a loud laugh . They again took me up to carry , and the multitude of natives gave a shout , which much diverted us . They next carried me to a place they call the custom-house . It was a small open shed , in which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . After searching Mr. Judson very closely , they asked liberty for a native female to search me , to which I readily consented . I was then brought to the mission house , where 1 have entirely recovered my health . " Her journal contains some interesting exercises of her mind , for a few weeks after her arrival in Rangoon . It /q/ will be seen that she enjoyed an uncommon degree of communion with God and felt a solemn pleasure in devoting herself anew to the service of her Redeemer , in the great work of communicating to the Butmans the knowledge of salvation : July 22 . It is now a week since we arrived here . My health is quite restored , and 1 feel much more contented and happy , than I ever expected to be in such a situation . I think I enjoy the promises of God , in a higher degree than ever before , and have attained more true peace of mind and trust in the Saviour . When 1 look back to my late situation , in that wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life-no physician  --  no female attendants  --  so weak , that I could nut move , I hope I am deeply sensible of the kind care of my heavenly Father , in carrying me safely through the peculiar dangers of the voyage , and giving me once more a resting place on land . Still , were it not for the support we derive from the Gospel of Jesus , we should be ready to sink down in despondency , in view of the dark and gloomy scenes around us . But when we recollect that Jesus has commanded his disciples to carry the Gospel to the heathen , and promised to be with them to the end of the world ; that God has promised to give the heathen to his Son , for an inheritance we are encouraged to make a beginning , though in the midst of discouragement , and leave it with him to grant success , in his own time and way . I find here no dear female friends , with whom I can unite in social prayer , nor even one with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society at all , but that of Mr. J. ; yet I . feel happy in thinking that I gave up this source of pleasure , as well as most others , for the sake of the poor heath.en . Though I am unworthy of being allowed to do any thing for Christ , I am happy that he has made it my duty . 40 live among them , and labor for the promotion of the kingdom of heaven . O if it may please the dear Redeemer to make me instrumental of leading some of the females of Burmah to a saving acquaintance with him , my great object will be accomplished , my highest desires gratified ; I shall rejoice to have relinquished my comforts , my country , and my home . But when I consider my vileness , my un . fitness to communicate divine truth ; when I consider how mixed with sin my best and purest motives ever are , I fear I shall never be used as an instrument in promotfng the holy // cause of Christ . I feel my soal sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hardly find utterance at the throne of grace  --  can only weep over my vileness , and groan for deliverance . At such times , I feel a disposition to pray earnestly , that God will not withhold his blessing on my account , but overlook my guilt , and for Jesus ' sake let this infant mission live and prosper . O Lord , here I am ; thou hast brought me to this heathen land , and given me desires to labor for thee . Do with me what pleaseth thee . Make me useful or not , as seemeth good in thy sight . But O let my soul live before thee ; let me serve none but thee ; let me have no object in life , but the promotion of thy glory . July 24 . My mind has been serious and solemn this evening , and I have enjoyed a most precious season of commu uion with God . Felt my own needy , helpless state , but at the same time realized the ability and willingness of Christ to give me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and find rest for the soul . I do not know that I ever had more longing desires to be free from sin , to be holy as God is holy , and to serve him with all my powers . Could not but mourn and weep over my remaining sinfulness , unbelief and hardness of heart , and breathe out my longing desires for more sanctifying grace . I do rejoice that jod has brought me to this heathen land  --  deprived me of many things from which I once derived happiness , and taught me that I must now seek happiness in him alone . Our situation is such that we are compelled to trust in God ; and we find in reading his word , and meditating on the promises therein contained , such strength and support as we never before experienced . Lord , let us live to thee , , tind serve thee faithfully in this heathen land , and we ask no more . ' * Aug. 15 . It is indeed an unfailing source of consolation , that we have a God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make known our wants by prayer and supplication . When we feel discouraged , in view of the many and great obstacles in the way of spreading the Gospel , and in view of our own vileness and unfitness to be employed in this blessed work , we are often relieved and animated by the assurance , that all things are possible with God , that it is easy for him to remove every obstacle , and that he is ever ready to hear our cries for divine assistance . I have enjoyed a most happy season at the throne of grace this evening . When I first approached I was depressed MKMOIR OF MRS . JUDSOMT. lOlS with a sense of my darkness , stupidity and guilt . But these feelings soon gave way to earnest and longing desires for more holiness , conformity to God , and devoted ness to his cause .

Yet I felt a melting , broken heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings in view of death , which would deliver me from all my spiritual enemies , and introduce me into the presence of Him whom alone I desire to serve , in my present sinful , imperfect state . I have begun to study the language .

Have been reviewing the past week , and find great cause for mourning and lamentation , for thanksgiving and praise . God is good . God is love . All his works are indicative of his wisdom and power ; and a discovery of his glorious perfections must produce implicit confidence and trust in all holy beings .

Who can describe the height and depth , the breadth and length of the love of Christ ? Yes , blessed Saviour , the perfections of thy Father , the glories of the Godhead , are revealed to sinners , through thy agonies and death . They are not only revealed , but enjoyed . The discovery transforms us into thine own image , and makes the heart a fit residence for thy Holy Spirit .

" Had a comfortable and happy season in prayer this evening . Felt a disposition to pray , that God would enable us to continue in this country , bear with submission and fortitude the trials and afflictions before us , and spread the light of truth through the empire .

Though I have but few temptations , 1 find that the innate depravity of my heart is constantly showing itself , in some way or other .

Found that a recollection of former enjoyments , in my own native country , made my situation here appear less tolerable . The thought that I had parents , sisters and beloved friends , still in existence , and at such a distance , that it was impossible to obtain a look , or exchange a word , was truly painful , While they are still in session of the comforts I once enjoyed , I am an exile froqi my country , and my father 's house , deprived of all society , and every friend , but one , and with scarcely the necessaries of life . These privations would not be endured with patience in any other cause but that in which we are eagaged. /q/ But since it is thy cause , blessed Jesus , we rejoice that thou didst give us so many enjoyments to sacrifice , and madest it so plainly our duty to forsake all , in order to bring thy truth to the benighted heathen .

Yes , I do feel thankful that God has brought me to this heathen land , and placed me in a situation peculiarly calculated to make me feel my dependence on him , and my constant need of the influences of the Holy Spirit . I enjoy more , in reading the Scriptures , and in secret prayer , than for years before ; and the prosperity of this mission , and the conversion of this people , lie with weight on my mind , and draw forth my heart in constant intercession . And I do confidently believe , that God will visit this land with gospel light , that these idol temples will be demolished , and temples for the worship of the living God erected in their stead . ** l ) i .

I have not enjoyed much through the day ; but this evening , in secret prayer , I had some glimpse of divine things , which greatly enlivened and animated my soul . While I felt burdened with sin , particularly that of a hard , insensible heart , the thought that God remains the same , still carrying on his great plan , according to his own will , for the glory of his name , and the good of his church and kingdom , " went through my mind with such awe-inspiring influence , that I felt no more anxiety for my insignificant self , and could not refrain from pouring out my soul , for the prosperity of Zion , and the display of God 's glory among the heathen . Of how little consequence are all things pertaining to our finite interests , compared with the glory of the infinitely blessed and ever glorious God . And how consoling the thought , that God will overrule all events , all the wrath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own glory , in the greatest possible happiness of his holy kingdom . O for a heart to love this God more , and serve him better . 18 . I have not been able to attend much to the study of the language for several days , in consequence of ill health , but hope I am making some progress . I feel that this at // jpreaent is my great object ; and that when my attention is diverted to any thing else , my time is lost . " St 25 . I feel composed and tranquil this evening , and desire to be truly thankful that we have closed another week in circumstances so comfortable , and are brought ' once more to the confines of holy time . I desire also to be truly thankful for the sweetness I have ' enjoyed in diTine things throughout the week . We have been reading . at our daily worship , the several last chapters of John , and the beginning of Acts ; and I think we never enjoyed so much in reading the Scriptures together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ  --  his instructions to the disciples as he led them through those amazing scenes , and the first formation of the Christian church . I never entered so much into the feelings of the disciples , when receiving his last instructions ; when deserting him through fear ; when following him to the cross ; when consigning him to the tomb . And I could almost participate in their joy , when they saw him risen from the dead ; when he appeared in the midst of them , telling them that he had all power in heaven and earth . The disciples had seen one of the darkest times the church had ever realized . They were ready to give up all for lost . But light arose out of the darkness of the tomb . They felt that Jesus was indeed the Christ  --  the Son of God . And no longer afraid of the face of man , they announced themselves the followers of Jesus , and declared to the whole world the wonders of his dying love . How full of instruction and consolation is thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple wise . Let the whole world hear the story of thy dying love . Let heathen nations know that thou didst dwell in flesh , and die for sinners , and now art able and mighty to save . ' ' Oct , 8 . To-day , I have been into the town , and I was surprised at the multitude of people , with which the streets and bazars are filled . Their countenances are intelligent ; and they appear to be capable , under the influence of the Gospel , of becoming a valuable and respectable people . But at present their situation is truly deplorable , for they are given to every sin . Lying is so common and univsal among them , that they say , ' We can not live without telling lies .

The portions of her journal which have been quoted will , we presume , be regarded as among the most interesting and valuable parts of this work .

Her deep and habitual piety is more fully exemplified in her private journal , than in her public writings , and in the open actions of her life .

But as he did not understand English , their only method , at first , oC acquiring information concerning the language , was to point to various objects , the names of which the teacher pronounced in Burman . Thus they gradually obtained some knowledge of its vocabulary and its structure ; but without a grammar or a dictionary , and with so little aid from their teacher , their progress was slow and discouraging . But they prosecuted their studies cheerfully , animated by the prospect of being able , at no distant period , to communicate to these idolatrous Burmans , in their own language , the tidings of salvation through a crucified Redeemer .

To-day , for the first time , I have visited the wife of the Viceroy . I was introduced to her by a French lady , who has frequently visited her . When we first arrived at the government house , she was not up , consequently we had to wait some time . But the inferior wives of the Viceroy diverted us much by their curiosity , in minutely examining ev6ry thing we had on , and by trying on our gloves , bonnets , &c.; At last her Highness made her appearance , dreesed richly in the Burman fashion , with a long silver pipe in her mouth , smoking . At her appearance , all the other wives took their seats at a respectful distance , and sat in a crouching posture , without speaking . She received me very politely , took me by the hand , seated me upon a mat , and herself by me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unwell . One of the women brought her a bunch of flowers , of which she took several , and ornamented my cap . She was very inquisitive whether I had a husband and children , whether I was my husband 's first wife  --  meaning by this , whether I was the highest among them , supposing that Mr. Judson , like the Burmans , had many wives ; and whether I intended tarrying long in the country . " When the Viceroy came in , I really trembled ; for I never before beheld such a savage looking creature . His long robe , and enormous spear , not a little increased my dread . He spoke to me , however , very condescendingly , and asked if I would drink some rum or wine . When I arose to go , her Highness again took my hand , told me she was happy to see me , that I must come to see her every day . She led me to the door ; I made my salam and departed . My object in visiting her was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burmans , I could have access to her , when perhaps it would not be possible for Mr. Judson to have an audience with the Viceroy . " They were soon convinced of the wretched and unseCp tied state of the country . Several robberies happened near them ; and the governor of a neighboring province was assassinated in open day . The assassin was put to death in a cruel manner , having most of his bones broken , and being kfi. to languish in the prison five or six days , in this dreadfiil sitaation . MEMOIR OF MRS. 117D80N . Ill ' ' April 16 , 1814 . Mr. Carey has lately returned from Calcutta , and much refreshed our minds with letters and intelligence from our friends . We are so much debarred from aJl social intercourse with the rest of the Christian world , that the least intelligence we receive from our friends is a great luxury . " We feel more and more convinced , that the Gospel must be introduced into this country , through many trials and difficulties , through much seif-denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their foolish conceit of superiority over other nations , the wickedness of their lives , together with the plausibility of their own religious tenets , make a formidable appearance in the way of their receiving the strict requirements of the Gospel of J &-; BUS . But all things are possible with God , and he is our only hope and confidence . He can make mountains become vallies , and dry places streams of water . " In August , Mr. Carey , his wife and children , embarked in a brig for Ava , having his furniture , medicine , wearing apparel , &c.; on board . The brig upset in the river , and Mrs. Carey , two children , all the women servants , and some of the men servants who could not swim , were drowned . Mr. Carey endeavored to save his little boy , three years old , but finding himself sinking , he was obliged to abandon the child . Mr. J. and his wife were thus left without any Christian friends ; but they proceeded diligently in their studies , enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were in the path of duty . Mrs. J. wrote thus to a friend : " As it respects ourselves , we are busily emoyed all day long . I can assure you that we find much pleasure in our employment . Could you look into a large open room , which we call a verandah , you would see Mr. Judson bent over his table , covered with Burman books , with his teacher at his side , a venerable looking man in his sixtieth year , with a cloth wrapped round his middle , and a handkerchief round his head . They talk and chatter all day long , with hardly any cessation . " My mornings are busily employed in giving directions to the servants  --  providing food for the family , &c.; At ten my teacher comes , when , were you present , you might see me in an inner room , at one side of my study table , and my teacher the other , reading Burman , writing , talking , &c.; /z/ I have many more interruptions than Mr. Judson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This I took upon myself , for the sake of Mr. Judson 's attending more closely to the study of the language ; yet I have found by a year 's experience , that it was the most direct way I could have taken to acquire the language ; as I am frequently obliged to speak Burman all day . I can talk and understand others better than Mr. Judson , though he knows more about the nature and construction of the language . " A new Viceroy has lately arrived , who is much beloved and respected by the people . He visited us soon after his arrival , and told us that we must come to the government house very often . We have been once or twice since , and were treated with much more familiarity and respect than are natives of the country . " We often converse with our teachers and servants on the subject of our coming to this country , and tell them if they die in their present state they will surely be lost , fiut they say , * Our religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are far from being discouraged . We are sensible that the hearts of the heathen , as well as those of Christians , are in the hands of God , and in his own time he will turn them unto iiim . " In a letter to Mr. Newell , written about this time , Mrs. Judson says : ** As it respects our temporal privations , use has made them familiar and easy to be borne ; they are of short duration , and when brought in competition with the worth of immortal souls , sink into nothing . We have no society , no dear Christian friends , and with the exception of two or three sea Captains , who now and then call on us , we never see a European face . When we feel a disposition to sigh for the enjoyments of our native country , we turn our eyes on the miserable objects around . We behold some of them laboring hard for a scanty subsistence , oppressed by an avaricious government , which is ever ready to seize what industry has hardly earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their few grains of rice , which ; when obtained , are scarcely sufficient to protract their wretched existence , and with no other habitation to cover them from the burning sun or chilly rains , than that which a small piece of cloth raised on four bamboos , under the shade of a tree , can afford . While we behold these scenes we feel that we have all the comforts , and in comparison /q/ even the luxuries of life . We feel that our temporal cap of blessings is full and runneth over . But is our temporal lot SO much superior to theirs ? O how infinitely superior are our spiritual blessings ! While they vainly imagine to purchase promotion in another state of existence , by strictly worshipping their idols , and building pagodas , our hopes of future happiness are fixed on the Lamb of God , who taketh away the sin of the world . When we have a realizing sense of these things , my dear brother , we forget our native country and former enjoyments , feel contented and happy with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being instrumental of leading these Burmans to partake of the same source of happiness with ourselves . ' Our progress in the language is slow , as it is pecoliarly hard of acquisition . We can , however , read , write , and converse with tolerable ease ; and frequently spend whole evenings very pleasantly in conversing with our Burman friends . We have been very fortunate in procuring good instructers . Mr. Judson 's teacher is a very learned man , was formerly a priest , and resided at court . He has a thorough knowledge of the grammatical construction of the language ; likewise of the Pali , the learned language of the Burmans . " After the first six months of their residence in Rangoon , Mrs. J. 's health had been on the decline , and as there was no medical aid in the country , she felt the necessity of going to some foreign port for its restoration . Such was the state of the mission , that she could not consent that Mr. J. should accompany her . She therefore embarked in January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered , and returned in the April following . During her absence , Mr. Judsou had no Christian with whom he could converse , or unite in prayer . He however pursued his great object , the acquiring of the language ; and , during this interval , was much encouraged by accounts from America , of the rapid increase of a missionary spirit . He thus expresses his feelings on receiving ' a copy of the proceedings of the Baptist General Convention in the United States , and letters from the Secretary of their Board of Foreign Missions : " These accounts from my dear native land were so interesting as to banish from my mind all thoughts of study . This general movement among the Baptist churches in /z/ America is particularly eQCouraging , as it affords an additional indication of God 's merciful designs in favor of the poor heathen . It unites with all the Bible Societies in Europe and America , during the last twenty years , in furnishing abundant reason to hope , that the dreadful darkness which has so long enveloped the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not the successes which have crowned some missionary exertions seem like the dawn of morning on the east ? O ! that this region of Egyptian darkness may ere long participate in the vivifying beams of light . ' None but one who has had the experience , can tell what feelings comfort the heart of a solitary Missionary , when , though all the scenes around him present no friend , he remembers , and has proof , that there are spots on this wide earth , where Christian brethren feel that his cause is their own , and pray to the same God and Saviour for his welfare and success . Thanks be to God , not only for ' rivers of endless joys above/ but for @#@ rills of comfort here below/ /z/ The following account of Mr. Judson 's attempt to communicate religious instruction to his teacher , will be read with interest .

The following letters , written by Mrs. Judson to her family , contain a statement of several interesting incidents : " Rangoon , Sept. 26 , 1815. * ' My dear Parents , Sisters , and Brother , ** Many months have passed since 1 attempted to write yoUy owing entirely to the great improbability of letters reaching you during the continuance of the war . But as we have lately heard that this unhappy contest has ended , and that peace is again restored , I am once more induced to take up my pen , though I shall be able to write but a few lines . Goodness and mercy still follow us , still the protecting hand of our heavenly Father is held out for our assistance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we experience the fulfilment of this promise , Lo , 1 am with you . In my last , I gave you a general account of events from our arrival here to that date . In a month or two from that date , I embarked for Madras , to procure medical assistance , and hoping a change of air would conduce to the restoration of my health . I was obliged to leave Mr. Judson here alone , without a single associate to animate him in his arduous work . We did not think it his duty for him to leave the mission , if I could possibly go alone . But though I was separated from him , and felt for the first time in my life that I was entirely alone in this wide world , yet I could not but trace the kind dealings of God in inclining every one with whom I had any concern , to favor and assist me in my way . The Viceroy gave me an order to take a woman with me , free from expense , a thing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burman law which forbids any female to leave the country . We went to him ourselves with a small present , which is customary when a favor is asked . On his seeing it , he inquired if we had any business ; and on Mr. Judson 's presenting the petition , he immediately commanded his writer to give us an official order , without causing us any expense whatever . The Captain with whom I went refused any pay for my passage , though he provided every necessary for one in ill health . I staid at Madras six weeks , and resided at Mr. Loveless ' house , where /z/ I received every attention . When about to leave Madras , I sent the physician under whose care I had been , seventy rupees , which he immediately returned , saying , he was happy if he had been serviceable to me . After an absence of three months , I safely arrived at Rangoon , where I found Mr. Judson well , and laboring hard , though entirely alone . My health continued to mend , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a little son . I had no physician or assistant whatever , excepting Mr. Judson . Since the birth of our little son , my health has been much better than for two years before . I feel now almost in a new state of existence . Our hands are full , and though our prospects in regard to the immediate conversion of the Burmans are dark , yet our trust in God is strong , and our hopes animating . " Mr. Judson has made considerable progress in the Pali language , which is the learned language of the Burmans , and without a knowledge of which , a man is not considered learned . I have again commenced studying the Burman , though I am not yet able to sit long at a time . ** You doubtless are expecting to hear by this time of the Burmans inquiring what they shall do to be saved , and rejoicing that we have come to tell them how they may escape eternal misery . Alas , you know not the difficulty of communicating the least truth to the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conceited notion of their own wisdom and knowledge , and the superior excellence of their own religious system . Sometimes when I have been conversing with some of the women , they have replied , * Your religion is good for you , ours for us . You will be rewarded for your good deeds in your way  --  we in our way . ' At other times , when Mr. J. had been telling them of the atonement by Christ , they would reply that their minds were stiff , that they did not yet believe , &c; . But these things do not discourage us . We confidently believe that God in his own time will make his truth effects ual unto salvatiob . We are endeavoring to convince the Burmans by our conduct , that our religion is different from theirs ; and I believe we have succeeded in gaining the confidence and respect of those with whom we have any concern , so that they tell others who know us not , that they need not to be afraid to trust us , for we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are very particular to pay , at the appointed time , for whatever we /z/ 118 Bfcinvm or krs. jitimon. pcrrchftde . The Barm &M; are surprised to see as ahKrtys employed , partiealarlj me , as the Burman women never think of doing any work if they can get their rice without . " Our present teacher is a learned man for a Barman ; he was once n priest , and lived at the golden feet , as they call the city of Ava . He makes every exertion possible to please as , lest he like his predecessors should lose his placei He is the fourth we have had , and we gire him only fifteen tiekals a month , which is about seven dollars . ** I know , my dear mother , you long very mtich to see my little son . I wish you were here to see him . He is a sprightly boy , and already begins to be very phiyfeL We hope his life may be preserved , and his heart that he may become a Missionary among the Burmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My dear Sisters , " In regard to the language , which sister A. wishes * to hear how it sounds , ' we feel quite at home , and can converse with ease on common subjects . We find the sobject of religion by far the most difficult , on account of the want of religious terms in their language . They have not the least idea of a God who is eternal  --  without beginning or end . All their deities have been through the several grades of creatures , from a fowl to a deity . When their deitfes take heaven , as they express it , they cease to exist , which , according to their ideas , is the highest state of perfection . It is now two thousand years smce Gaudama , their last deity , entered on his state of perfection ; and though he now ceases to exist , they still worship a hair df his head , which is enshrined in an enormous pagoda , to which the Burmans go every eighth day . They know of no other atbtiement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tou ' can not hnagine how very difficnit it is to give them any idea of the true God and the way of hration by Christ , since their present ideas of deity are so ery tow . qwq and candid attentioa of soiae , but have bs frequently sunk again by beholding their almost total indifference . At one time our hopes were quite raised by the serious attention of the aoa of a Governor , vrho came to us about a year , to learo English . He at times appeared solemn and inquisitive ; but about six months ago his father lost his office ; he of course lost his sense of dignity , mixed with his servants , and lost , we fear , most of his seriousness . He came here his last Sabbath to bid us farewell , as his father was called up to Ava . I asked him if he had forgotten the instructions he had formerly received . He said he had not , and repeated to us what we had told him concerning the character of Giod and of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been printed , and which he gladly received , saying , not a day should pass , without his reading it . Mr. J. told him , every time he read , he must ask God to give bim light , and enable him to understand it . Another , an old man above sixty , frequently visited us , and said he wisbdd to be instructed in our way , as he called it . He was of Portuguese descent , though a Burman in his habits . Mr. J  - -  talked much to him about bis depraved nature , and the necessity of a new heart . The last time he came , he inqoiced if we would not give money to those who were baptized and joined us , when Mr. J. told him no . He then asked what it was to have a new heart . Mr. J. told him  - -  when he replied , that he had got a new heart  --  that he believed in Christ and the true God . Mr. J. asked him how kmg since he felt his heart was new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in infancy  --  had always worshipped the true God , and had those feelings Mr. J. described . Mr. J. told him he was still in a very dangerous state , and if he died as he was , he would surely go to hell . He replied , your sayings are very hard , and I can not immediately understand them . Some other instances , still more encouraging , I could mention , but we must wait to see the event . These things , however , do not discourage us . It is God alone , who can effectually impress the mind with divine truths ; and though seed now sown may long lie buried in the dust , yet at some future period it may spring up , and bear fruit to the glory of God . When we read what wonders God is doing in the earth , in sending the Gospel into all parts of the world  --  when we read of Otaheitans and Chinese embracing the Gospel  --  shall we think it hard for him to convert the Burmans ? /z/ " The town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recalled by the King , and the former Viceroy is again to take the government of Rangoon . The present Viceroy has been here only a year and three months ; he is much beloved by the people , ten thousand of whom will go with him . We have had a very peaceable , comfortable time during his administration ; the town was in a flourishing state ; robberies very seldom on account of the effectual means he has taken to suppress them , and we strongly hoped he would be permitted to continue here for some time . The present Viceroy and wife are nearly related to the King . They have a daughter fifteen years old , who on her arrival at Ava is to be presented to the Prince Regent . She is a sensible , smart , satirical girl ; with a mind as capable of improvement as any young lady 's in America . She and her mother have ever treated me with marked attention . I went to take leave of them two or three days ago ; and when I entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , I took my seat with the women who had assembled to pay their respects , and which is two or three steps lower than where the Viceroy 's family flit . When the wife and daughter came in , they immediately told me to take my place with them , for it was not fitting that the wife of a priest should sit there . When I came away , her ladyship presented me with a string of coral , which is the second she has given me since her residence here . " O how I long to visit Bradford ! and spend a few evenings by your firesides , in telling you what I have seen and heard . Alas ! we have no fireside , no social circle ; we are still alone in this miserable country , surrounded by thousands who are ignorant of the true God , and only way of salvation by Jesus Christ . O pray for us , that we may be faithful unto death , and never give up or be discouraged , though we may not have immediate success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reason to thank God that he has brought us here . We do hope to live to see the Scriptures translated into the Burman language , and to see a church formed from among these idolaters . Did you know how much Mr. J. has to do , you would not wonder he does not write to you more . He sits at close study twelve hours out of the twenty-four . ' ' Some of the difficulties of the Burman language are thus described by Mr. Judson , in a letter to Dr. BoUcs , of Salem , dated Rangoon , January 16 , IS 6 ; /q/ * ' I jast now begin to see my way forward in this language , and hope that two or three years more will make it somewhat familiar ; but I have met with difficulties that I bad no idea of before I entered on the work . For a European or American to acquire a living oriental language , root and branch , and make it his own , is quite a different thing from his acquiring a cognate language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they are studied in the schools . One circumstance may serve to illustrate this . I once had occasion to devote a few months to the study of the French . I have now been above two years engaged in the Burman . If I were to choose between a Burman and a French book , to be examined in , without previous study , 1 should , without the least hesitation , choose the French . When we take up a western language , the similarity in the characters , in very many terms , in many modes of expression , and in the general structure of the sentences , its being in fair print , ( a circumstance we hardly think of , ) and the assistance of grammars , dictionaries , and instructors , render the work comparatively easy . But when we take up a language spoken by a people on the other side of the earth , whose very thoughts run in channels diverse from ours , and whose modes of expression are consequently all new and uncouth ; when we find the letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any language we had ever met with , and these words not fairly divided , and distinguished , as in western writing , by breaks , and points , and capitals , but run together in one continuous line , a sentence or paragraph seeming to the eye but one loof word ; when , instead of clear characters on paper , we find only obscure scratches on dried palm leaves strung together , and called a book ; when we have no dictionary , and no interpreter to explain a single word , and must get something of the language , before we can avail ourselves of the assistance of a native teacher ,  --  * Hoc opus , his labor est . ' I had hoped , before I came here , that it would not be my lot to have to go alone , without any guide , in an unexplored path , especially as Missionaries had been here before . But Mr. Chater had left the country , and Mr. Carey was with me very little , before he left the mission and the mkr sionary work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interesting and encouraging to the friends of the mission ; but it must not yet be expected . It unavoidably takes several years to acquire such a language , in order to converse and write intelligibly on the great truths of the Gospel . Dr. Carey once told me that after he had been some years in Bengal , and thought he was doing very well , in conversing and preaching with the natives , they , ( as he was afterwards convinced ) knew not what he was about . A young Missionary , who expects to pick up the language in a year or two , will probably find that he has not counted the cost . If he should be so fortunate as to obtain a good interpreter , he may be use ful by that means . But he will learn , especially if he is in a new place , where the way is not prepared , and no previous ideas communicated , that to qualify himself to communicate divine truth intelligibly , by his voice or pen , is not the work of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am beginning to translate the New Testament , being extremely anxious to get some parts of Scripture , at least , into an intelligible shape , if for no other purpose than to read , as occasion offers , to the Burmans with whom I meet . " At this juncture , their heavenly Father was pleased to visit them with the most distressing trial , which can wring a parent 's heart . Their darling boy , who was their solace in their lonely condition , was removed from them by death . The event is described in a letter of Mrs. J. with all the pathos of a mother 's sorrow : " Rangoon , May 7 , 1816. ** My dear Parents , * ' Little did I think when I wrote you last , that my next letter would be filled with the melancholy subject on which I must now write . Death , regardless of our lonely situation , has entered our dwelling , and made one of the happiest families wretched . Our little Roger Williams , our only little darling boy , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months we enjoyed the precious little gift , m which time he had so completely entwined himself around his parents ' hearts , that his existence seemed necessary to their own . But God has taught us by afflictions , what we would not learn by mercies  --  that our hearts are his exclusive property , and whatever rival intrudes , he will tear it away . /q/ " As I feel incapable of writing on any other subject , I will give you the particulars of his little probation , and the last painful scene which has rent our hearts . " He was a remarkably pleasant child ,  --  never cried except when in pain , and what we often observed to each other was the most singular , he never , during his little exists ence , manifested the least anger or resentment at any thing . This was not owing to the want of intellect , for his tender feelings of sensibility were very conspicuous . Whenever I or his father passed his cradle without taking him , he would follow us with his eyes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance so expressive of grief , though perfectly silent , that it would force us back to him , which would cause his little heart to be as joyful as it had been before sorrowful . He would lie hours on a mat by his papa 's study table , or by the side of his chair on the floor , if he could only see his face . When we had finished study , or the business of the day , it was our exercise and amusement to carry him round the house or garden , and though we were alone , we felt not our solitude when he was with us . For two months before he died , I observed with much anxiety , that he had violent fits of perspiration every night , and a slight degree of fever . But as he appeared well through the day , and had a good appetite for his food , and continued to grow fleshy , I strongly hoped it would wear ofiP , and terminate in the cutting of his teeth . But alas ! all our hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cradle , he appeared as well as usual ; but not long after , he was taken with a violent coughing , which continued without cessation for half an hour . This brought on a fever , which continued strong through the day and night ; but Wednesday morning it abated , and he slept quietly through the day , and took his food with as good an appetite as usual . Thursday his cough returned , and with it the fever , which again much alarmed us , and we sent for a Portuguese priest , ( the only person who knows any thing about medicine in the place , ) who gave him a little rhubarb and gascoign powder . But nothing appeared to affect the distress in his throat , which was the cause of his coughing , and made him breathe sohard , that every breath could be heard some way . Friday night I sat by him till two o'clock , when , being much fatigued , I retired , and Mr. Judson took him . The little creature drank his milk with much eagerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was refreshed and // would go to sleep . He laid bim in his cradle  --  he slept with ease for half an hour , when his breath stopped without a struggle , and he was gone ! Thus died oar little Roger . * Short pain , short grief , dear bahe , was thine ,  --  ' Now , joys eternal and divine . ' We buried him in the afternoon of the same day , in a little enclosure , the other side of the garden . Forty or fifty Burmans and Portuguese followed , with his afflicted parents , the last remains to the silent grave . All the Burmans who were acquainted with us , endeavored to sympathize with us , and console us under our loss . Our little Roger was the only legitimate child of foreign parents in the place ; consequently he was quite a curiosity to the Burmans . But what shall 1 say about the improvement we are to make of this heavy affliction 1 We do not feel a disposition to murmur , or to inquire of our Sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit down submissively under the rod and bear the smart , till the end for which the affliction was sent , shall be accomplished . Our hearts were bound up in this child ; we felt he was our earthly all , our only source of innocent recreation in this heathen land . But God saw it was necessary to remind us of our erior , and to strip us of our only little all . O may it not be in vain that he has done it . May we so improve it , that he will stay his hand and say , ' It 4s enough . ' ** May 18 . It is just a fortnight to day , since pur little boy died . We feel the anguish a little abated , and have returned to our study and employment ; but when for a moment we realize what we once possessed , and our now bereaved state , the wound opens and bleeds afresh . Yet we would still say , ' Thy will be done . ' " Two or three days ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her state . She had heard of the death of the little white child , as she called him , and came to pay a visit of conddence. 1 once - carried him to her house , when she took the velvet cushion on which she usually sits , and placed the little boy upon it , and exclaimed . What a child , ' how white , &_c.; After caressing him for some time , I got up to go , but she requested me to stay till the Viceroy came in . He soon entered the room , when she again exclaimed , ' Look , my Lord , see what a child I look at his feet , look at his bands , ' both of which were remarkabl j Ay . The old Viceroy , a huge looking man , who has at /q/ least twenty or thirty children , smiled on the little babe , made some inquiries respecting him , and took his leave . Ever since that time , when we met , she would anxiously inquire about him . When she saw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , * Why did you not send me word , that I might have come to his funeral V I told her I did not think of any thing , my distress was so great . She then tried to comfort us , and told us not to weep . She was accompanied by all her officers of state and attendants , all of which were about two hundred people . I gave her tea , sweetmeats and cakes , with which she appeared much pleased . O that she might become a real disciple of Jesus 1 " I sometimes have good opportunities of communicating religious truths to the women in the government-house , and hope I shall have an opportunity of conversing with the wife of the Viceroy herself . " All is Egyptian darkness around us  --  not a glimpse of light . Mr. Judson had just completed a tract in the Burman language , a summary of the Christian religion , when his eyes became so weak , and his head so much affected , that he was obliged to lay aside all study , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now six weeks since this took place , and he is now only able to study about half the day . This we feel to be a severe affliction . My health is indifferent . We are anxiously looking for the arrival of the other Missionaries , who we hope will strengthen this mission . ' ' Mr. Judson 's health had now become so impaired , by close attention to study , that he was forced to desist from reading , and from all other mental exertion , for several months . He was apprehensive , that it would be necessary to take a voyage to Bengal , for the restoration of his health , though he felt a great reluctance to suspend , for a moment , his efforts to prepare himself for usefulness among the idolatrous millions , who were perishing around him . Exercise on horseback , and a more nutritive diet , restored his health , in some degree ; but he was on the point of sailing for Calcutta , when he received the joyful intelligence , that Mr. and Mrs. Hough had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vessel in which Mr , and Mrs. J. were about to take passage , being detained longer than was expected , they determined to relinquish the design , and to remain in Rangoon . Mr , Judson 's 126 BfSBiOiB or mm. hjbbos. health gradually became better , and he was enabled to resume bis literary labors . During the period of his iUr ness , while incapable of reading , from the weakness of his eyes , he employed himself in preparing a grammar of th language , for the benefit of future Missionaries . Mr. Hough arrived in Calcutta , in April , 1816 De . Carey had recently received letters from Mr. Judson , informing him , that he wished several small tracts priftied at Serampore . The Dr. and his associates immediately adr vised , that a printing office be established at Rangoon ; and , with their characteristic liberality , made a present to the mission of a printing press , types and other printing apparatus , with which Mr. Hough and wife arrived at Rangoon , in October , 1816 . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus reinforced by two other Missionaries . They had been laboring in silence and sorrow , for three years , without the encouraging thought , that tbey were , the mean while conferring any direct benefit on the natives . They were however , preparing themselves for usefulness . They had so far become familiar with the language , that they could converse with considerable facility , and Mr. Judson had prepared two tracts , which were printed by Mr. Hough , soon after his arrival . Mr. Judson says , in a letter written at this period : ' The British Baptists have made a noble beginning in Western India . It remains for American Baptists to make an attempt on the eastern side . As for myself , I fear I shall prove only a pioneer , and do a little in preparing the way for others . But such as 1 am , I feel devoted to the work , and , with the grace of God , and the help of the So* ciety , am resolved to persevere to the end of my life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will show what considerations prevented discouragement under such cir  - -  cumstances : * ' If any ask what success I meet with among the natives  --  tell them to look at Otaheite , where the Missionaries labored nearly twenty years , and not meeting with the slightest success , began to be neglected by all the Christi%n world , and the very name of Otaheite was considered a  --  hame to the cause of missions ; but now the blessing begins to descend . Tell them to lQ ) k at Bengal also . /q/ where Dr. Thomas had been laboring sevonteen years that is , from 1783 to 1800 , before the first convert , Krisbno , was baptized . When a few converts are once made , things move on . But it requires a moch longer time than I have been here , to make a first impression on a heathen people . If they ask again , What prospect of ultimate success is there ? Tell them , as much as that there is an almighty and faithful God , who will perform his promises , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg them to let me stay and make the attempt , and let you come , and give us our bread ; or , if they are unwilling to risk their bread on such a forlorn hope as has nothing but the word of Ood to sustain it , beg of them at least not to prevent others from giving us bread . And if we live some twenty or thirty years , they may hear from us again . " 1 have already written many things home about Rangoon . The climate is good , better than any other part of the east . But it is a most wretched place . Missionaries must not calculate on the least comfort , but what they find in one another and in their work . However , if a ship was lying in the river , ready to convey me to any part of the world I should choose , and that too with the entire approbation of all my Christian friends , I should not , for a moment , hesitate on remaining . This is an immense field ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems wholly thrown on the bands of the Americans . If we desert it , the blood of the Burmans will be required of us. * ' In encouraging young men to come out as Missiona ries , do use the greatest caution . One wrong-headed , conscientiously obstinate man would ruin us . Humble , quiet , persevering men ; men of sound , sterling talents , of decent accomplishments , and some natural aptitude to acquire a language ; men of an amiable , yielding temper , irithng to take the lowest place , to be the least of all , add the servants of all ; men who enjoy much closet religion  --  who live near to God , and are willing to suffer all things for Christ 's sake , without being proud of it ;  --  these are the men we i need . " A letter written by Mr. Hough , February SOth , 1817 , contains some interesting particulars relative to the missitm ; and also describes the Burman mode of burying their priests . /z/ ' ' I can say truly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 saw it . A warm hearted Christian in America would think , that a poor miserable idolater would leap for joy at the message of grace . But it is not so in Bur- mah : ' @#@ Here Satan binds their captive minds Fast in his slavish chains. * " The few with whom brother Judson has conversed , since I have been here , appear inaccessible to truth . They sit unaffected , and go away unimpressed with what they have heard . They are unconvinced by arguments , and unmoved by love ; and the conversion of a Burman , or even the excitement of a thought towards the truth , must and will be a sovereign act of divine power . We long to see that act of power displayed : even one instance would fill us with joy . " Brother Judson has never yet been abroad to preach* He ha applied himself constantly to the study of the language , with a view to the translation of the New Testa ment . We both concur in the opinion , that before preaching be undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in circulation . ' The Burmans , when any thing is said to them on the subject of divine truth , inquire for our holy books ; and it is a pleasing fact , that scarcely a Burman , with the exception of females , is incapable of reading . Besides , during the progress of translation , many theological terms , appropriate to the different branches of doctrine , may be familiarly acquired , and their use established ; which , without much consideration , might be erroneously employed , and thus wrong ideas conveyed . Having , therefore , press and types here , we can not conscientiously withhold from this people the precious oracles of God . This opinion has influenced us to issue , as soon as preparations could possibly be made , two small tracts ; one a summary of Christian doctrine , and the other a catechism . The one I was enabled to print the latter part of the last , and the other the first of the present , month . These two little tracts are the first printing ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every Christian feeling , that God has reserved introduction of this art here , for his own use . " When a priest dies , he has peculiar honors paid him . Several months since , a neighboring priest died , or return ed  --  for the Burmans think it undignified to say that a priest dies  --  his body was immediately wrapped up in tar and /q/ wax ; holes were perforated through the feet , and some distance up the legs , into which , one end of a hollow bamboo was inserted , and the other fixed in the ground ; the body was then pressed and squeezed , so that its fluids were forced down through the legs , and conveyed off by means of the bamboos ; in this state of preservation the body has been kept . For some days past , preparations have been making to burn this sacred relic and to-day it passed off in fumigation ! " It may be said of the Burman , as of every other pagan religion , there is no power in it to make men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to judge of the moral character of its devotees . The Burmans are subtle , thievish , mercenary , addicted to robbery and fraud ; truth and honesty are not known among them as virtues . They are excessively prone to gambling and sporting . " The government of the country is in the will of the Sovereign , who considers his subjects as slaves ; in short , every person coming into the country , reports himself * the King 's most willing slave . ' The Viceroy of Rangoon acts with a power limited only by the King . He punishes criminals with severity . The mildest manner of suffering death is to have the head taken off , which is done with a large knife , at one stroke . Reprieves from extreme desert , however , are often purchased with money ; but when a malefactor is destitute of friends and money , he dies without mercy . " /z/ Mr. Judson*s Visit to Chittagong  --  Persecution of Mr. Hough , and his Departure for Bengal  --  Return of Mr. Judson  --  Arrived of Messrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became brighter . The language had been acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Judson , a grammar had been prepared , two tracts were printed ; the one containing a view of the Christian religion , of which one thousand copies were printed , and the other a catechism , of which three thousand copies were printed . An edition of eight hundred copies of the Gospel by Matthew translated by Mr. Judson , was comroenced. /z/ But God was about to gladden their hearts , by showing them some of the fruits of that seed which they had scattered with tears . In March , 1817 , Mr. Judson wrote thud to the Corresponding Secretary : " I have this day been visited by the rst inquirer after religion , that I have seen in Burmah . For although in the course of the two last years I have preached the Gospel to many , and though some have visited me several times , and conversed on the subject of religion ; yet I have never had much reason to believe that their visits originated in a spirit of sincere inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and though I have sometimes been encouraged to hope that truth had made some impression , never , until to-day , have 1 met with one who was fairly entitled to the epithet of Inquirer . ' ' As I was sitting with my teacher , as usual , a Burroan of respectable appearance , and followed by a servant , came up the steps , and sat down by me . I asked him the usual question , where he came from : to which he gave me no explicit reply ; and I began to suspect that he had come from the government house , to enforce a trifling request , which in the morning we had declined . He soon , however , undeceived and astonished me , by asking , * How long a time will it take me to learn the religion of Jesus V I replied that such a question could not be answered . If Grod gave light and wisdom , the religion of Jesus was soon learnt ; but without God , a man might study all his life long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came you to know any thing of Jesus ? Have you been here before ? ' No . ' Have you seen any writings concerning Jesus ? ' 1 have seen two little books . ' Who is Jesus ? ' He is the Son of God , who , pitying creatures , came into this world , and sujQfered death in their stead . ' Who is God ? ' He is a Being without beginning or end , who is not subject to old age or devAii , but always is . ' I can not tell how I felt at this moment . This was the first acknowledgment of an eternal God , that I had ever heard from the lips of a Burman . I handed him a tract and catechism , both of which he instantly recognized , and read here and there , making occasional remarks to his follower , soch as , ' This is the true God  --  this is the right way , ' &c.; I now tried to tell him some things about G and Christ , and himself ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious only to get another book . I had MEMOIR OF MRS . HUDSON . 131 -i already told him two or three times that I had finished no other book ; but , that in two or three months , I would give him a larger one which 1 was now daily employed in translating . * But/ replied he , ' have you not a little of that book done , which you will graciously give me now V And I , beginning to think that Goal 's time was better than man 's , folded and gave him the two first half sheets , which contain the first five chapters of Matthew ; on which he instantly rose , as if his business was all done ; and having received an invitation to come again , took leave . Throughout his short stay , he appeared different from any Bur man I have met with . He asked no questions about customs and manners , with which the Burmans tease us exceedingly . He had no curiosity , and no desire for any thing , but ' more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conduct proved that he had something on his mind , and I can not but hope that I shall have to write about him again . **March 2L We have not yet seen our inquirer ; but to-day we met with one of his acquaintances , who says that he reads our books all the day , and shows them to all who call upon him . We told him to ask his friend to come and see us again . * ' 26 . An opportunity occurs of sending to Bengal . I am sorry that I can not send home more interesting letters . But 1 am not yet in the way of collecting interesting matter . I have found that I could not preach publicly to any advantage , without being able , at the same time , to put something into the hands of the hearers . And , in order to qualify myself to do this , I have found it absolutely necessary to keep at home , and confine myself to close study , for three or four years . I hope , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public entrance on my work than has yet been done . But many difficulties lie in the way . Our present house is situated in the woods , away from any neighbors , and at a distance from any road . In this situation , we have no visiters , and no passing travellers , whom we could invite to stop and hear of Christ . My attempts to go out and find auditors have always occasioned such a waste of time , and interruption of study , as would not often be indulged in , or justified . We are very desirous of building a small house near the town , on some public road . " Mrs. Judson wrote- thus to a friend in August , 1817 : ** Since Mr. Hough 's arrival , he has printed a tract of considerable length , being a view of the Christian religion , // which Mr. Judson had previously composed ; and also ft small catechism for children , and Matthew 's Gospel . These are in circulation , and are well understood by those who read them . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more particularly into the new religion . But we have frequently observed in these inquirers a fear lest others should discover their inclination to inquire . Sometimes , when two or three intimate friends have been seriously engaged in conversing on religious subjects , if others , with whom they were not acquainted , called at the same time , * they would be silent , and take their leave . This makes us feel the importance of trying to obtain the patronage of government . In a few months , Mr. Judson will complete a dictionary of the fiurman language ; after which he will , perhaps , go up to Ava , the residence of the King . " If we were convinced of the importance of missions , before we left our native country , we now also see and feel their practicability . We could then picture to ourselves the miserable situation of heathen nations ; but we now see a whole populous empire , rational and immortal like ourselves , sunk in the grossest idolatry ; given up to follow the wicked inclinations of their depraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least spark of true benevolence . Let those who plead the native innocence and purity of heathen nations , visit Burmah . Their system of religion has no power over the heart , or restraint on the passions . Besides being destitute of life , it provides no atonement for sin . Here , also , the Gospel triumphs over this , and every other religion in the world . This is the grand difference ; this makes the Gospel @#@ good news , ' indeed , to the heavy laden and sin-sick soul . " How interested you would be , could you meet with my little society of females on the Sabbath . Interested I say  --  yes , you would be interested , if it was only from this circumstance  --  that these poor idolaters enjoy the means of grace , and sit under the sound of the Gospel . I have generally fifteen or twenty . They are attentive while I read the Scriptures , and endeavor to teach them about God . One of them told me the other day , that she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand-parents , &c.; &c.; had embraced , and accepting a new one , of which they had never heard . I asked her if she wished to go to hell , because her progenitors had gone there . She replied , if with all her offerings and good works on her head , ( speaking in their idiom ) she must go to hell , /q/ then lei her go . I told her , if she went to hell after having heard of the Saviour , her very relations would contribute to torment and upbraid her , for her rejection of that Saviour of whom they had never lieard , and that even she herself would regret her folly when it was too late . If I do , said she , I will then cry out to you to be my intercessor with your Grod , who will certainly not refuse you . Another told me that she did believe in Christ , and prayed to him every day . I asked her if she also believed in Gaudama , and prayed to him . She replied , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes and expectations raised by the apparent seriousness of several females , as Mr. Judson has in regard to several men ; but their goodness was like the morning cloud and early dew , which soon passeth away . Four or five children have committed the catechism to memory , and often repeat it to each other . " The following letter describes some of the offerings made by the Burmans at their festivals , and also contains a description of the celebrated pagoda at Rangoon : " This is the season for the great feast of Gaudama . It commenced yesterday , and it is to continue for three days . It is observed all over the country , * but I presume the multitude collected in this place is much greater than at any other , excepting Ava . Priests and people come in boats from a great distance , to worship at the pagoda in this place , which is supposed to contain a relic of Gaudama . The Viceroy , on these days , goes out in all the pomp and splendor possible , dressed and ornamented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of government and the common people . After kneeling and worshipping at the pagoda , they generally spend the day in amusements , such as boxing , dancing , singing , theatrical exhibitions , and fire-works . Most of the older people spend the night at the pagoda , and listen to the instructions of the priests . ' Great and expensive offerings are made at this season . One last year , presented by a member of government , cost three thousand tickals , or twelve hundred dollars . It was a kind of portable pagoda , made of bamboo and ptaper , richly ornamented with gold leaf and paintings . It vrstsu hundred feet in height , and the circumference of its base about fifty . Halfway up its height , was a man ludicrous- M i /z/ ly dressed , with a mask oq his face , white wings on his shoulders , and artificiai finger nails , two inches in length , in the posture of dancing . This offering was carried bj sixty men , preceded by a band of music , and followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other offerings presented at this festival , are various kinds of artificial trees , the branches and twigs of which are filled with cups , bowls , handkerchiefs , and garments of all descriptions ; these are given to the slaves attached to the pagoda , who , the week following , have something like a fair , to dispose of their offerings . " The pagoda to which such multitudes resort , is one of the largest and most splendid in the empire . Afler having ascended a flight of steps , a large gate opens , when a wild , fairy scene is abruptly presented to view . It resembles more the descriptions we sometimes have in novels , of enchanted castles , or ancient abbeys in ruins , than any thing we ever meet in real life . The ground is completely covered with a variety of ludicrous objects , which meet the eye in every direction , interspersed with the banyan cocoa-nut , and toddy trees . Here and there are large open buildings , containing huge images of Gaudama ; some in a sitting , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attendants , in the act of worship , or listening to his instructions . Before the image of Gaudama , are erected small altars , on which offerings of fruit , flowers , &c.; are laid . Large images of elephants , lions , angels and demons , together with a number of indescribable objects , all assist in filling the picturesque scene . " The ground on which this pagoda is situated , commands a view of the surrounding country , which presents one of the most beautiful landscapes in nature . The polished spires of the pagodas , glistening among the trees at a distance , appear like the steeples of meeting-houses in our American sea-ports . The verdant appearance of the country , the hills and valleys , ponds and rivers , the banks of which are covered with cattle , and fields of rice ; each , in their turn , attract the eye , and cause the beholder to exclaim , * Was this delightful country made to be the residence of idolaters ? Are those glittering spires , which , in consequence of association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the monuments of idolatry V O my friend ! scenes like these , productive of feelings so various and opposite , do , notwithstanding , fire the soul with /q/ an unconquerable desire to make an effort to rescue this people from destruction , and lead them to the Rock that in higher than they . " In November , 1817 , Mr. Edward Wheelock , a member of the Second Baptist Church in Boston , and Mr. James Colman , a member of the Third Baptist Church in that city , sailed from Boston , to join the Mission . They were young men of talents , and of exemplary piety , who were constrained by the love of Christ to offer themselves as messengers of the Saviour , to bear his unsearchable riches to the distant heathen . With the hope that the sentiments uttered by these excellent young men , who were so soon summoned away from their earthly toils , may enkindle a flame of zeal in some kindred hearts , the following extracts are quoted from their letters to the Board : Mr. Colman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion , my mind has been unwavering . It is true , mountains , at times , have arisen between myself and the eastern world . My way has been hedged up by difficulties , which to the eye of human reason might appear insur* mountable . But duty has constantly appeared the same . Indeed , I esteem missionary work , not only as a duty for me to perform , but as a privilege for me to enjoy ; a privilege which I value more than the riches of the earth . Only give me the rich satisfaction of holding up the torch of truth , in the benighted regions of Burmah ! This is the object which lies nearest my heart ; for this , I can cheerfully leave my native land , and the bosom of my beloved friends . I pant to proclaim the Gospel to those who are ignorant of it ; to present to their minds that firm foundation on which my own hopes of eternal happiness are built . I look to Burmah as my home , and as the field of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I long . to present . the Bible , the fountain of knowledge , and to direct their wandering steps to the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls . Nor can I refrain from cherishing the hope , that my feeble labors among them will be crowned with the blessing of Heaven . Some , I trust , will be induced to forsake the worship of idols , and to bow the knee to Him , on whose vesture and thigh is written , King of Kings J and Lord of Lords . Prompted , as I believe , by a deep sense of the worth of souls , and by the command of our blessed Saviour , who ays ' Go ye into aU the worlds /z/ and preach the Gospel to every creature ; and encoaraged by his promise of constant assistance and direction to his servants , I voluntarily and joyfully offer myself to be your Missionary to the Burman empire . May the Lord preside over your deliberations , and grant me , if it can be consists ent with his holy will , the unspeakable happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Wheelock closed his application to the Board with the following lines : * ' To you , honored fathers , is my mind directed , as to those , who , under God , must decide my case . To you I of ler , freely and joyfully offer myself , to become your Missionary , to aid those already under your patronage , to turn the poor Burmans/rom idols , to serve the living and true God . And O I if it is consistent that one so unworthy , and so unqualified as myself , should engage in this glorious work , deny me not , I beseech you , the unspeakable privilege ; deny me not the fondest , the most ardent desire of my soul , that can , in this world , be gratified . To deny me this , would be to deprive me of the greatest happiness which , in this world , I can possibly enjoy . I would rather be a Missionary of the qross , than a King on a throne . Let the men of this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cankered gold ; let the voluptuary enjoy his sordid pleasures ; let the ambitious ascend to the pinnacle of earthly honor ; but let me enjoy the sweet satisfaction of directing the poor pagans to the ' Lamb of God . ' I court no greater good ; I desire no greater joy ; I seek no greater honor . To Burmah would I go ; in Burmah would I live ; in Burmah would I toil ; in Burmah would I die ; and in Burmah would 1 be buried . " ' In December , 1817 , Mr. Jiidson lefl Rangoon on a visit to Chittagong , in Arracan , for the purpose of benefitting his health , and of procuring one of the native Christians , residing there , who spoke the Burman language , to assist him in his first public attempts to preach the Gospel . He designed to be absent but three months : but the vessel was detained by contrary winds , and becoming unmanageable in the difficult navigation along the coast , her direction was changed for Madras , and Mr. Judson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his missionary labors , to a distant partof India , whidi he had no /q/ wish to visit . The vessel was unable to reach Madras , and Mr. Judson was carried to a place three hundred miles from that city , to which he was obliged to travel by land . Here he endeavored to obtain a passage for Rangoon , but was unsuccessful ; and he was detained at Madras , till July 20 , when he sailed for Rangoon in an English ship . During his absence , very alarming incidents occurred at Rangoon , which threatened , for a while , to destroy the mission . Nothing , indeed , but the special providence of God , &nd; the firmness of Mrs. Judson , prevented an abandonment of the station , which might have been final . Under date of January 18 , 1818 , she thus wrote to Dr. Baldwin : " We still live in a quiet manner , unmolested by government , or robbers . The Viceroy 's family treat us with respect and affection , now and then sending us an elephant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Vicereign , professes a particular regard for me , and I , in return , have presented her with a translation of Matthew 's Gospel , a tract , and catechism , and have had two or three opportunities of conversing with her privately on the subject of religion . How much she reads in the former , or believes in the latter , I am unable to say ; but neither produces any visible effect . She ordered the instructress of one of her daughters to give the catechism to her to commit to memory . ** January 30 . The Burman Mr. Judson mentioned some time ago , as being the first serious inquirer , and one who has excited the most hope , came to-day to the missionhouse . It is now almost a year since he first came , and with much apparent anxiety inquired , ' How long time will it take me to learn the religion of Jesus ? ' We have since frequently inquired , but obtained little information respecting him , until to-day . Soon after his first visit , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Syrian river , in the country of Pegu . He has been at Rangoon but once since , and then on business by order of the Viceroy , and obliged to return immediately . * ' I asked him if he had become a disciple of Jesus Christ . He replied , ' 1 have not yet , but 1 am thinking and reading in order to become one . I can not yet destroy my old mind ; for when I see a handsome patso , ( a cloth the Burman men wear , ) or a handsome gownbown , ( the handkerchief worn on the head , ) I still desire them . Tell the great teacher . /z/ when he returns , that I wish to see him , though I am not a disciple of Christ . ' He requested the remaining part of Matthew 's Gospel , also catechisms and tracts for his followers . I gave all of his attendants tracts ; on which he said to them , ' Take and read them attentively , and when you have embraced the doctrines they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " A letter , dated February 18 , 1818 , says : * ' It is now four years and a half , since we took up our residence in this spiritually benighted land , and to this day do we offer our thanks to God , for having brought and continued us here . To this day can we testify that God is good ; that he is a faithful , covenant-keeping God , who is worthy of the entire trust and confidence of all his creatures . Never , for a moment , has he left us to feel , that our first views of the practicability of missions were visionary ; consequently , we have been preserved from those distressing , agonizing feelings , resulting from regret and disappointment in a darling object . On the contrary , we feel that Hussions to the heathen are not only practicable , but that the very blood of their souls will be required at the hand of those Christians , who neglect to make exertions to send the Gospel among them . " Mrs. Judson thus describes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alluded : " Three months of Mr. Judson 's absence had nearly ex* pired , and we had begun to look for his return , when a native boat arrived , twelve days from Chittagong , bringing the distressing intelligence , that neither Mr. Judson nor the vessel had been heard of at that port . I should not have given so much credit to this report , as to have allowed its harassing my feelings , had it not been corroborated by communications from my friends in Bengal , which arrived just at this time . From the circumstance , that the vessel had not reached the port of destination , I knew not what conclusion to draw . Hope , at times , suggested the idea that the ship 's course might have been altered , that she might yet be safe ; but despondency more frequently strove to convince me that all was lost . Thus was 1 , for four months that agonizing state of suspense , which is frequently ' e oppressive than the most dreaded certainty . /q/ ' Two or three days after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M Hough received an order , couched in the most menacing language , to appear immediately at the courthouse , to give an account of himself . This , so unlike any jraessage we had ever before received from government , ' spread consternation and alarm among our teachers , domtestics , and adherents ; some of whom followed Mr. vHoufh at a distance , and heard the appalling words , from ; jne of . the petty officers , that a royal order had arrived fir ' the . banishment of all foreign teachers . As it was late iV ) ken ' ' Mr. Hough arrived at the court-house , he was merefijbr4ered to give security for his appearance at an early hoiijron the approaching day , when , to use their own unfeeti language , ' if he did not tell all the truth relative to his ' isiji ( tion in the country , they would write with heatw blood . ' embarrassments at this period were greatly increasey the circumstance , that the Viceroy and family , who haiSidways been our steady iriends , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we had but aglight acquaintance , had left his family at the capital . MrT Hough was not sufficiently acquainted with the language , to allow his appealing in person to the Viceroy ; and as it is not customary for females to appear at his court , in the absence of the Vicereign , we had nothing before us but the gloomy prospect of being obliged to submit to all those evils , in the power of petty officers to inflict , when unprotected by higher authority . " The following days , Friday and Saturday , Mr. Hough was detained at the court-house , &nd; under the necessity of answering , through an interpreter , the most trivial questions ; such as , what were the names of his parents , how many suits of clothes he had , &c.; all which were written down in the most formal manner imaginable . The court would not allow his retiring for any refreshment ; and this , together with several other petty grievances , convinced us that it was their object to harass and distress us as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that we could not appeal to the Viceroy . " It appeared , in the issue , that the object of the Burman officers was , to extort money from Mr. Hough . An order had been received from the King , that the Portuguese priests , three in number , should leave the country . To ascertain who they were , the Viceroy had issued an /z/ order that all the foreign priests should appear at the court house , not intending that any but the Portuguese should be examined , further than to ascertain that they were not Portuguese . Mr. H. and Mrs. J. resolved to appeal to the Viceroy , and Mrs. J. 's teacher drew up a petition , which she herself presented , with some of the feelings and of the intreplidity of Esther . The Viceroy immediately commanded , that Mr. Hough should receive no further molestation . About this time , that dreadful disorder , the cholera morbus , began to rage among the natives . It was in the hottest season of the year , and Rangoon was soon filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were traversing the streets ; and they endeavored to expel them , by making a noise . Cannons were accordingly fired , and every one began beating his house with and other instruments of uproar . But the disease continued to make frightful ravages . By the blessing of God , howeves not a single individual , on the mission premises , died* There was , at this time , too , a report of war between England and Burmah , and the English vessels were hastening to depart . It was now six mouths since Mr. Judson had been heard from . In these distressing circumstances Mrs. Judson wrote to a friend , under date of July 2 1 " Mr. Hough , for some time past , has been desirous to have Mrs. Hough , myself , and his children , go to Bengal . But I have ever felt resolved not to make any movement until I hear from Mr. Judson . Within a few days however , some circumstances have occurred , which hav  --  iaduced me to make preparations for a voyage . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an embargo is laid on English ships , it will be impossible for Mr. Judson ( if he is yet alive ) to return to this place . But the uncertain* ty of meeting him in Bengal , and the possibility of his arriving in my absence , cause me to make preparations with a heavy heart . Sometimes I feel inclined to remain here alone , and hazard the consequences . I should rtainly conclude on this step , if any probability existed of Mr. Judson 's return . This mission has never appeared in so low a state as at the present time . It seems now entirely destroyed , as we all expect to embark for Bengal in a day or two . Alas ! alas ! how changed our prospects sine* Mr. Judson lefl us . Low dark , how intricate the providence which now surrounds us 1 Yet it becomes us to be /q/ etill , and know that he is God , who has thus ordered our circumstances . ** July 14 . Alone , my dear friends , in this great house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I take my pen to relate the strange vicissitudes through hich I have passed within a few days . ** On the 5th of this month , 1 embarked with Mr Hough and family for Bengal , having previously disposed of what I could not take with me . I had engaged Mr. Jud son 's teacher to accompany me , that in case of meeting him in Bengal , he could go on with his Burman studies . But the teacher , feering the difficulties arising from his being a Burman , broke his engagement , and refused to go . My disinclination to proceed in the course commenced , had in  - -  creased to such a degree , that I was on the point of giving up the voyage myself i but my passage was paid , my baggage on board , and I knew not how to separate myself from the rest of the mission family . The vessel , however , was several days in going down the river ; and when on the point of putting out to sea , the Captain and officers ascertained she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been improperly loaded , and that she must be detained for a day or two at the place in which she then lay . I immediately resolved on giving up the voyage , and returning to town . Accordingly the Captain sent up a boat with me , and engaged to forward my baggage the next day . I reached town in the evening  --  spent the night at the house of the only remaining Englishman in the place , and today have come out to the mission-house , to the great joy of all the Burmans left on our premises . Mr. Hough and his family will proceed , and they kindly and affectionately urge my return . I know I am surrounded by dangers on every hand , and expect to see much anxiety and distress ; but at present I am tranquil , and intend to make an effort to pursue my studies as formerly , and leave the event with God . " Thus did this noble minded woman resolve to remain alone at Rangoon , and confront all the perils which might beset her ; although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The event justified her courage and rewarded her constancy . In a few days , Mr. Judson returned to Rangoon , and the apprehensions of his wife were at once dispelled . /z/ // The vessel in which Mr. and Mrs. Hough had taken passage , was detained several weeks ; but they finally sailed for Bengal , carrying with them the press and other printing apparatus . In April , 1818 , Messrs . Colman and Wheelock , with their wives , arrived at Calcutta , from Boston , after a pleas ant voyage , during which their prayers and zealous instructions were made instrumental , by the Holy Spirit , in the conversion of several of the seamen . They sailed from Calcutta , August 19 , for Rangoon , where they arrived September 19 , a few weeks after the return of Mr. Judson . Thus did the clouds , which had recently hung over the mission , disperse ; and the Missionaries felt th truth and beauty of the sentiment : ** The Lord can clear the darkest skies . Can give us day for night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight . " /z/ Mr , Judson commences PrectcMng  --  First Convert haptiz ' ed  --  Death of J/r . Wheelock , The mission had now been established several years , and something had been done , by private conversation , and through the press , to convey the knowledge of salvation to the natives . But it was thought that the time had arrived for more public and enlarged efforts . Mr. Judson was sufficiently master of the language to preach publicly . Tracts and portions of the Scriptures were ready to be placed in the hands of inquirers . It was , therefore , resolved to erect a small building , ( called a zayat ) adjoining the mission premises , near a great road leading to one of the principal pagodas , and consequently much thronged . Here it was designed to preach the Gospel , and to converse with any persons who might choose to visit it . This was a hazardous attempt . The Missionaries had remained unmolested , because they had lived retired , and had been able to obtain the favor of the Viceroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to convert the MEMOm OF MRS . JlTDSOItr. 14S natives to Christianity , was likely to attract the attention and displeasure of the government . It was well known , that a renunciation of the established religion would be punished with death . But the Missionaries resolved to make the attempt , and trust in the Lord for protection . Messrs . Colman and Wheelock immediately commenced the study of the language , but their health was so impaired , particularly that of Mr. W. that their progress was slow and limited . In April , 1819 , the zayat was opened , and a new era in the mission commenced . Mr. Judson says : ** To-day the building of the zayat being sufficiently advanced for the purpose , 1 called together a few people that live around us , and commenced public worship in the Burman language . I say commenced , for though I have frequently read and discoursed to the natives , I have never before conducted a course of exercises which deserved the name of public worship , according to the usual acceptation of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gospel , as soon as I could speak intelligibly , I have thought it hardly becoming to apply the term preaching , ( since it has acquired an appropriate meaning in modern use , ) to my imperfect , desultory exhortations and conversations . But I hope , though with fear and trembling , that I have now commenced a course of public worship and regular preaching . " The congregation to-day consisted of fifteen persons Qiily , besides children . Much disorder and inattention prevailed , most of them not having been accustomed to attend Barman worship . May the Lord grant his blessing on attempts made in great weakness , and under great disadvantages ; and all the glory will be his . * ' April 6 . This evening I went , for the second time , to hear a popular Burman preacher . On our arrival , we found a zayat , in the precincts of one of the most celebrated pagodas , lighted up , and the floor spread with mats . In the centre was a frame raised about eighteen inches from the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He appeared to be about forty-five years old , of very pleasant countenance , and harmonious speech . He was once a priest , but is now a layman . The people , as tfaey came in , seated themselves on the mats , the men on one side of the house , and the women on the other . It /z/ was an undistingaished day , and the oongregation was very small , not more than one hundred . When we entered , aome said , * There come some wild foreigners ; ' but when we sat down properly , and took off our shoes , they began to say , ' No , they are not wild , they are civilized . ' Some re- cognized me , and said to another , * It is the English teacher , ' a name by which I am commonly known . The preach* er soon took notice of us , entered into some conversation , invited us to visit him , and so on ; but on learning that I was a Missionary , or , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said no more . The people being now convened , one , appointed for the purpose , called three times for silence and attention . Each one then took the flowers and leaves which had been previously distributed , and placing them between his fingers , raised them to his head , and in that respectful posture , remained motionless , until the service was closed . This ceremony we of course declined . When all things were properly adjusted , the preacher closed his eyes , and commenced the exercise , which consisted in repeating a portion from their sacred writings . His subject was the conversion of the two prime disciples of Gaudama , and their subsequent promotion and glory . His oratory I found to be entirely different from all that we cdll oratory . At first , be seems dull and monotonous ; but presently , his soft , mellifluent tones win their way into the heart , and lull the soul into that state of calmness and serenity , which , to a Burman mind , somewhat resembles the boasted perfection of their saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at the close , the whole assembly burst out into a short prayer , after which all rose and retired . This man exhibited twice every evening , in different places . Indeed he is the only popular lay preacher in the place . As for the priests , they preach on special occasions only , when they are drawn from their seclusion and inactivity , by the solicitar tions of their adherents . ' ' April 25 . Lord 's day . Yesterday we completed the zayat , set up the front stairs , and laid open the entrance from the road . This morning I took my seat on the floor in the open porch , under some solemn impression of the great responsibility attached to my new mode of life . " In the forenoon the members of the mission family came over to have our usual worship , having concluded to hold it for a few Sundays in the zayat , rather than in the /q/ house , in order to give the Burmans some idea of the place . ' ' In the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the road , so that we had an assembly of between twenty-five and thirty , besides children . At the close of the service , I distributed several tracts to the strangers . ** April 27 . One of the most attentive of the hearers last night , came again , with a petty officer from another village . They staid most of the day , and received a great deal of instruction ; and lefl , with the promise that they would come as often as the distance of their residence would permit . Considerably encouraged to-day with the hope that God is preparing a people in this benighted land . ** 28 . Nothing interesting through the day . At night , encountered a bitter opposer : he had visited Bengal , and some foe to missions had poisoned his mind ; he manifested a most virulent spirit . I felt that he would most gladly be foremost in destroying us . But through divine grace I was enabled to treat him with meekness and gentleness , and he finally left me politely . He appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus describes the zayat , and the method of conducting the school : ' ' The zayat is situated thirty or forty rods from the mission-house , and in dimensions is twenty-seven by eighteen feet . It is raised four feet from the ground , and is divided into three parts . The first division is laid entirely open to the road , without doors , windows , or a partition in the front side , and takes up a third part of the whole building . It is made of bamboo and thatch , and is the place where Mr. Judson sits all the day long , and says to the passers by , ' Ho ! every one that thirsteth , ' &/C.; The next , and middle division , is a large airy room , with four doors and four windows , opening in opposite directions ; made entirely of boards , and is whitewashed , to distinguish it from the other zavats around us. * In this room we have public worship in Burman on the Sabbath ; and in the middle of which I am now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male scholars are at one end , each with his torch and black board , over which he is industriously bending , and emitting the curi- /z/ // oos sounds of the langruage . The third and last is only an entry way , which cens into the garden , leading to the mission house . ** In this apartment , all the women are seated , with their lights and black boards , much in the same position and employment as the men . The black board , on which all the Burmans learn to read and write , answers the same purpose as our slates . They are about a yard in length , made black with charcoal and the juice of a leaf ; and letters are clearly imprinted with a species of white stone , a little similar to our slate pencils . A lesson is written out on this board by an instructer ; and when the scholar is perfect master of it , it is erased , and a new one written . The Burmans are truly systematic in their elementary instructions , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he has a perfect knowledge of all the various combinations of letters . ' ' At this time Mrs. Judson wrote the following letter to her sisters : " Rangoon , April 29 , 181 9. -* My dear Sister M. " Being left alone in my room this afternoon , I know not how I can spend it more pleasantly than in writing to a dear , far-distant sister , whom I never expect to meet again until we arrive at our Father 's house in heaven . Though it is seven years since I left my native land and scenes of my earliest years , they are as fresh in my recollection as though it were but yesterday ; and the wound then inflicted every now and then opens and bleeds afresh . I believe very few females who have left their native country , have had it in their power to make such sacrifices as myself . When I think of my pleasant home , and dear Bradford friends ; the flattering prospects and sources of enjoyment which I left , T am often led to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deliberately embrace a life replete with vicissitudes as the present . But , my dear sister Mary , a little sacrifice for the cause of Christ is not worth naming ; and 1 feel it a privilege , of which I am entirely undeserving , to have had it in my power to sacrifice my all for Him who hesitated not to lay down bis life for sinners . I rejoice that I had a pleasant home , dear friends , and flattering prospects , to relinquish , and that once in my life I had an opportunity of manifesting my little attachment to the cause of Christ . I know you mniOlR OF MM . JVINIOH. 147 often wi to know ceriamlif whether I still approve of the first step I took in the missionary cause ; and whether , if I had the choice again to make , with my present knowledge and views of the subject , I should make the same . Well , I frankly acknowledge that I should do just the same , with this exception ; that I should commence such a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my unfitness ; and should almost hesitate whether one so vile , BO poorly qualified , ought to occupy a sphere of so much usefulness . I do at times feel almost ready to sink down in despair , when I realize the responsibility of my situation , and witness my short-comings in duty . If 1 have grown any in grace since I lefl America , it has consisted entirely in an increasing knowledge of my unspeakably wicked heart . As to my real religious enjoyment , I think , generally speaking . I have not experienced more than when in America . I do hope , however , vile as I am , to obtain an inheritance in that better world , where Jesus has prepared mansions for his followers , and will introduce , them there himself , sprinkled with his blood , and clothed in his righteousness . ** Relative to the mission , it is gaining ground slowly , but I hope surely . We have a place erected for public worship , where Mr. Judson and myself spend the day in conversing with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the women . On the Sabbath we have regular public worship in the Burman language . The building is situated on one of the public roads ; which , on account of its being lined on both sides with pagodas , is called Pagoda road . ** This last week has been a very interesting one to us , on account of having had several very hopeful inquirers , who really appeared to be a prepared people for the Lord . I have a meeting every Wednesday evening with the females , many of whom aear attentive and inquisitive ** I have been attending to the Siamese language for a year and a half . It is a language easy of acquisition , when one has a teacher he understands . I have not found it so difiicult as the Burman ; but it has been owing , probably , to the teacher 's being a Burman , as well as Siamese scholar . There are several thousands of Siamese who live in Rangoon , and who speak and write the pure language of Siam . With the assistance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burman catechism , tract , and Matthew . I have also nearly completed a translation of one of their celebrated books into English . It is an account of the in- 148 uBflioia.or MM. ivoaev. oarnatioa of ode of their deities , when he existed in the form of a great eiephant/ ' The 30th of April , IS 1 9 , is a memorable day in the history of this Mission . On that day , Moung Nau , * the first convert , made his first visit to the zayat . He was then silent and reserved , and excited little attention or hope . Bat the next day , and on several succeeding days , he repeated his visit . Mr. Judson says in his journal , May 5 : ' * Moung Nau has been with me several hours . I begin to think that the grace of God has reached his heart . He expresses sentiments of repentance for his sins , and faith - in the Saviour . The substance of his profession is , that from all the darkness , and uncleanness , and sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour but Jesus Christ ; no where else can he look for salvation ; and therefore he proposes to adhere to Christ , and worship him all his life long . ' ' It seems almost too much to believe , that God has begun to manifest his grace to the Burmans ; but this day I could not resist the delightful conviction , that this is really die case . Praise and glory be to his name forevebMORB  - -  Amen . " May 6 . Moung Nau was again with me a great part of the day . He appears to be slowly growing in religious knowledge , and manifests a teachable , humble spirit , ready to believe all that Christ has said , and obey all that he has commanded . " He is thirty-five years old , no family , middling abilities , quite poor , obliged to work for his living , and therefore his coming day after day to hear the truth , affords stronger evidence that it has taken hold of his mind . May the Lord graciously lead his dark mind into all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed Saviour . " 8 . Burman day of worshipw Thronged with visiters through the day . Had more or mss company , without intermission , for about eight hours . Several heard much of the Gospel , and engaged to come again . Moung Nau was with me a great part of the day , and assisted me much in explaining things to new comers . Towards night , a man * It may be well here to state , that the Burmans use a number of titles , like our Mr. Miss and Mrs. to designate individuals , with reference to their ae : Moung , denotes a young man ; Oo , an old man ; Mee , a girl ; Mah , a young woman ; May , an old woman . /q/ came in , by name of Moung Shwa Oo , whom I think it time to mention particularly , as he has visited me several times , and though , like Moung Nau , apparently backward at first , he appears to be really thoughtful . He is a young man of twenty seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . " May 9 . Lard 's day . Moung Shwa Oo came in the morning , and staid through the whole day . Only two or three of all I conversed with yesterday came again  --  Had , however , ' an assembly of thirty  --  After worship , some warm disputation . I begin to feel that the Burmans can not stand before the truth . In the course of conversation , Moung Nau declared himself a disciple of Christ , in presence of a considerable number ; and even Moung Shwa Oo appeared to incline the same way . " 11 . Had more or less company from morning till night . Among the rest , Moung Shwa Oo , and two or three others , who appear to be pretty well satisfied that the Boodhist religion has no foundation . Conversation was very animated , and somewhat encouraging ; but I wanted to see more seriousness , and more anxiety to be saved from sin . " Heard much to-day of the danger of introducing a new religion . All agreed in opinion , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a King who could not bear that his subjects should differ in sentiment from himself , and who has , for a long time , persecuted the priests of the established religion of the empire , because they would not sanction all his innovations . Those who seemed most favorably disposed , whispered roe , that I had better not stay in Rangoon and talk to common people , but go directly to the ' hrd of life and death ' If he approved of the religion , it would spread rapidly ; but , in the present state of things , nobody would dare to prosecute their inquiries , with the fear of the King before their eyes . They brought forward the case of the Kolans , a sect of Burmans , who have been proscribed and put to death under several reigns . I tried to set them right in some points , and encouraged them to trust in the care of an Almighty Saviour ; but they speak low , and look around fearfully , when they mention the name of the * otoner of the sword* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has attended two Sundays , and made some occasional visits , was with me aeveral hours . He professes to have felt the truth of this religion , ever since he first heard about it , and now desires /z/ to be a disciple of Christ . He has obtained , I find , considerable knowledge of the Christian system ; but does not appear to have much sense of his own sins . May the Spirit teach him what man cannot. *May 21 . Had several attentive hearers ; among the rest Moung A. who says that the good news has taken hold of his mind . I have been so frequently disappointed in visitors , who appeared promising the first time , but never came again , that I have lost all credit in early professions ; yet I can not but hope well of this man , especially as Moung Nau speared to like him better than any other inquirer. *June 6 . Lords day . After partaking of the Lord 's supper in the evening , we read and considered the following letter of Moung Nau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , Moung Nau , the constant recipient of your excellent favor , approach your feet . Whereas my Lord 's three have come to the country of Burmah , not for the purpose of trade , but to preach the religion of Jesus Christ , the Son of the eternal God , I , having heard and understood , am with a joyful mind filled with love . * I believe that the Divine Son , Jesus Christ , sufiered death in the place of men , to atone for their sins . Like a heavy laden man , I feel my sins are very many . The punishment of my sins I deserve to suffer . Since it is so , do yoil , sirs , consider that I , taking refuge in the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ , and receiving baptism , in order to become his disciple , shall dwell one with yourselves , a band of brothers , in the happiness of heaven , and therefore grant me the ordinance of baptism. * It is through the grace of Jesus Christ , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continent to another , and that we have met together . I pray my Lord 's three , that a suitable day may be appointed , and that I may receive the ordir nance of baptism . * Moreover , as it is only since I have met with you , sirs , that I have known about the eternal God , I venture to praj that you will still unfold to me the religion of God , that my old disposition may be destroyed , and my new disposition improved . ' * * At the time of writing this , not having heard much of baptismi he teems to have ascribed an undue efiicacy to the ordinance . He has since corrected his error ; but the translator thinks it the most fair and Impartial , to give the letter just as it was written at first . " /q/ " We have all , for some time , been satisfied concerning the reality of his religion , and therefore voted to receive him into church fellowship , on his being baptized , and prch posed next Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . To-day Moung Shwa Doan appeared again , after an absence of several weeks , and a little revived our hopes concerning him . Several whom I have particularly mentioned , have discontinued their visits , though I am satisfied that they are convinced of the falsity of the Burman religion , and of the truth of the Christian . I can not possibly penetrate their motives . Whether , after several visits , they meet with some threatening suggestion , that awakens their fears of persecution , or whether , at a certain stage in their inquiries , they get such an insight into the Gospel , as arouses the enmity of the carnal heart , I am not able from my experience hitherto to ascertain . ' ' During the period embraced in the preceding extracts , they had been annoyed by vexatious taxes , which they were forced to pay . In June , the news arrived that the King had died , or ( as the Burmans expressed it , ) ' * had gone up to amuse himself in the celestial regions . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death one of his uncles , and imprisoning another , who soon after died . Such are the usual accompaniments of the accession of a new monarch in oriental countries . ** June 23 . Had some encouraging conversation with Moung Thah-lah , a young man who has been living in our yard several months . He had lately made me several visits at the zayat , and appeared very thoughtful and teachable . To-day , on being asked the state of his mind , he replied with some feeling , that he and all men were sinners , and exposed to future punishment ; that , according to the Boodhist system , there was no way of pardon ; but that according to the religion which I taught , there was not only a way of pardon , but a way of enjoying endless happiness in heaven ; and that , therefore , he wanted to believe in Christ I stated to him , as usual , that he must think much on the love of Christ , and pray to God for an enlightened mind and new heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his case . " In the evening female meeting , his sister , Mah Baik , whose husband also lives in our yard , manifested consider- /z/ tibje feeling , ( especially when Mrs. Jadson prayed with her ialone , ) and expressed strong desires to obtain an interest in the Saviour . " On the 27th of June , 1819 , the first baptism occurred in the Burman empire . It was a day of unutterable joy to the Missionaries , who had so long been " going forth weeping , bearing precious seed/ ' -* June 27 . Lords day . There were several strangers present at worship . After the usual course , 1 called Mouog Nau before me , read and commented on an appropriate portion of Scripture , asked him several questions concerning his faith , hope , and love , and made the baptismal prayer , having concluded to have all the preparatory exercises done in the zayat . We then proceeded to a large pond in the vicinity , the bank of which is graced with an enormous image of Gaudama , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may it prove the beginning of a series of baptisms in the Burman empire , which shall continue io uninterrupted succession to the end of time ! " July 4 . Lord 's day . We have had the pleasure of sitting down , for the first time , at the Lord 's table , with a converted Burman ; and it was my privilege ,  --  a privilege to which I have been looking forward with desire for many years ,  - -  to administer the Lord 's supper in two languages . " The power and grace of God thus displayed in the conversion of one Burman , the first who ever ventured publicly to profess the religion of Christ , afforded the strongest evidence of his approbation of the mission ; and ministered the most cheering encouragement to the Missionaries . The new convert became a valuable assistant to Mr. Judson , and showed a strong desire to communicate to others the knowledge of that Saviour , who had become precious to his own heart . Mrs. Judson says , in a letter , dated June 3 : * ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should soon have the joyful intelligence to communicate , that one Burman has embraced the Christian religion , and given good evidence of being a true disciple of the dear Redeemer . This event , this single trophy of victorious grace , has filled our hearts with sensations hardly to be conceived by Christians in Christian countries . This circomatanee has convinced us , that God can and does operate on the minds of the most dark and ignorant ; and that he nuisM operation . It serves , also , to encourage us to hope , that the Lord has other chosen ones in this place . As Mr. Judson has given some account of the first impressions of this man , and as I have had him particularly under my instruction since his conversion , I will give you some of his remarks in his own words , with which you will be much interested . ' n our religion , there is no way to escape the punishment due to sin ; but according to the religion of Christ , he himself has died in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become his disciples ; then we should meet together as you do in your country ; then we should all be happy together in heaven . How great are my thanks to Jesus Christ for sending teachers to this country I and how great are my thanks to the teachers for coming ! Had they never come and built that zayat , I should never have heard of Christ and the true God . I mourn that so much of my life passed away before I heard of this religion . How much I have lost ! ' It is peculiarly interesting to see with what eagerness he drinks in the truths from the Scriptures . A few days ago , I was reading with him Christ 's sermon on the mount . He was deeply impressed , and unusually solemn . * These words , ' said he , ' take hold on my very heart ; they make me tremble . Here God commands us to do every thing that is good in secret , not to be seen of men . How unlike our religion is this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great noise with drums and musical instruments , that others may see how good they are . But this religion makes the mind fear God ; it makes it of its own accord fear sin . ' When I read this passage , Zay not up for yourselves treasures 4*c. he said , * What words are these ! It does not mean that we shall take the silver and gold from this world and carry them to heaven ; but that by becoming the disciples of Jesus , we shall live in such a manner as to enjoy heaven when we die . ' We have taken him into our employ for the present as a copyist , though our primary object was to have him near us , that we might have a better opportunity to know more of him before he received baptism , and of imparting to him more instruction than occasional visits could afford . Mornings and evenings he 1 spends in reading the Scriptures , and when we all meet J in the hall for family worship , he comes and sits with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can think of God I in his heart . /z/ t i. 4 MEMOIR OF MK8. - *June 4 . I have just had a very interesting meeting with the women , fifteen in number . They appeared unusually solemn , and I could not help hoping that the Holy Spirit was hovering over us , and would ere long descend , and enlighten their precious immortal souls . Their minds seem to be already prepared to embrace the truth , as their prejudices in favor of the Burman religion are apparently destroyed . They also appear to be convinced , that the atonement for sin provided in the Gospel is suitable for persons in their situation . But they frequently say , the great difficulty in the way of their becoming Christians is the sinfulness of their hearts , which they can not yet overcome . O for the influences of that Spirit , which can alone effect the mighty change ! " The operations of the mission thus proceeded with many encouraging indications of divine favor , and of the effect of truth on the minds of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mah Baik and others , appeared to be seriously intent on the salvation of their souls .. In July , Mr. Judson enlarged and revised the tract for a new edition , and added to it several prayers . Its title was , ** A View of the Christian Religion , in four parts , Historical , Practical , Preceptive , and Devotional . " It was sent to Serampore to Mr. Hough , and an edition of five thousand copies was printed . , On the 7th of August , Mr. Wheelock embarked for Bengal , in so low a state of health , that no hopes were entertained of his return . A few days after he sailed , a violent fever deprived him of his reason , and in a paroxysm of delirium , he plunged into the sea , and was drowned , the vessel sailing with such velocity , that no effort could be made to save him . Thus early did his Master call him away from the earth . The desire of his heart to visit the heathen was gratified ; but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Saviour whom he loved . Mysterious , indeed , are the ways of God . Mrs. Wheelock , who accompanied him on the voyage , proceeded to Bengal . The Board offered to defray the expenses of her return to this country ; but she preferred to remain in Calcutta , hoping that she might be useful to the heathen . She has since been married to Mr. Jones , of Calcutta . Several visiters attended occasionally at the zayai , but we can not take special notice of any others , than those /z/ /q/ who became real believers in the Saviour , and were baptized . " August 22 , LorcPs day . Two of the adherents of the Mangen teacher , the popular preacher that I mentioned some time ago , were present at worship . I had much conyersation with them ; in the course of which , I so clearly refuted their system , in two or three instances , that they could not refrain from an involuntary expression of assent and approbation . They directly said , however , that it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw more clearly the truth of our Saviour 's words , Ye will not come unto me . " After worship , had another conversation with Moung Thah-lah . He hopes that he is a disciple of Jesus Christ in heart ; but wants to know whether a profession of religion is indispensable to salvation . He fears the persecution that may hereafter come on those who forsake the established religion of the empire . 1 gave him such explanation as I thought suitable , and left him , with the solemn consideration , that unless he loved Christ above his own life , he did not love him sincerely , and ought not to hope that he is interested in his redemption . ** His sister Mah Baik is in a very similar state . She has been particularly attentive and solemn in her appearance for some time past . ' * 24 . Another conversation with Moung Thah-lah , which at length forces me to admit the conviction that he is a real convert ; and I venture to set him down the second disciple of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new born soul ; and though rather timid in regard to an open profession , has , I feel satisfied , that love to Christ , which will increase and bring him forward in due time . " The 26th of August was made memorable by the first visit of Moung Shwa-gnong , a learned teacher of considerable distinction . He appeared to be half deist and half sceptic . " August 27 . The teacher Moung Shwa-gnong came agaip , and staid from noon till quite dark . We conversed incessantly the whole time ; but I fear that no real impression is made on his proud , sceptical heart . He , however , // promised to pray to the eternal God , through Jesus Christ and appeared at times to be in deep thought . He is a man of very superior argumentative powers . His conversation would probably shake the faith of many . " Aug. 31 . A man , by the name of Mounging , has visited the zayat five or six days in succession . At first , a variety of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversed chiefly with Moung Nau , and employed himself in reading Matthew . He once told Moung Nau , that be had long been looking after the true religion , and was ready to wish that he had been bom a brute , rather than to die in deJusion and go to hell . Sunday I conversed with him largely , and his attention , during worship , was very close and solemn . To-day he has made me half inclined to believe that a work of grace is begun in his soul . He says that he formerly had some idea of an eternal God from his mother , who was christened a Roman Catholic , in consequence of her connection with a foreigner ; but that the idea was never rooted in his mind , until he fell in with the zayat . Within a few days he has begun to pray to this God . He is quite sensible of his sins and of the utter inefficiency of the Boodhist religion ; but is yet in the dark concerning the way of salvation , and says that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him more . Lord Jesus , give him the saving knowledge of thine adorable self ! " September 3 . A great crowd of company through the whole day ; the teacher , Moung Shwa-gnong , from ten o'clock till quite dark , with several of his adherents . He is a complete Proteus in religion , and I never know where to find him . We went over a vast deal of ground , and ended where we began in apparent incredulity . " AAer he was gone , Moung Ing , who has been listening , all day , followed me home to the house , being invited to stay with Moung Nau , through the night . We conversed all the evening , and his expressions have satisfied us all , that he is one of God 's chosen people . His exercises have been of a much stronger character than those of the others , and he expresses himself in the most decided manner . He desires to become a disciple in profession , as well as in heart , and declares his readiness to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stated the danger to which he was exposing himself , and asked him whether he loved Christ better than his own life , he replied , very deliberately and solemnly , * When I meditate on this religion , I know not what it is to love my own life . ' Thus /q/ the poor fisherman , Moung lag , is taken , while the learned teacher , Moung Shwa-gnong , is lefL " Sept 6 . Spent the evening in conversing with Moung Byaa , a man who , with his family , has lived near us for some time , a regular attendant on worship , an indefatiga* ble scholar in the evening school , where he has learned to read , though fifty years old , and a remarkably moral character . In my last conversation , some time ago , he appeared to be a thorough legalist , relying solely on his good works ; but yet sincerely desirous of knowing and embracing the truth . The greater part of the evening was spent in discussing his erroneous views ; his mind seemed so dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Towards the close , however , he seemed to obtain some evangelical discoveries , and to receive the humbling truths of the Gospel , in a manner which encourages us to hope that the Spirit of God has begun to teach him . The occasion of this conversation was , my hearing that he said that he intended to become a Christian , and be baptized with Moung Thah-lah . He accordingly professes a full belief in the eternal God , and his Son Jesus Christ . * ' 11 . Moung Shwa-gnong has been with me all day . It appears that he accidentally obtained the idea of an eternal Beings about eight years ago ; and it has been floating about in his mind , and disturbing his Boodhist ideas , ever since . When he heard of us , which was through one of his adherents , to whom I had given a tracts this idea received cons-iderable confirmation ; and to-day he has fully admitted the truth of this first grand principle . The latter part of the day , we were chiefly employed in discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence which proves that the writings of the apostles of Jesus contain that revelation ; and I think 1 may say , that he is half inclined to admit all this . He is certainly a most interesting case . The way seems to be prepared in his mind , for the special operation of divine grace . Come , Holy Spirit , Heavenly Dove ! * ' His conversion seems peculiarly desirable on account of his superior talents and extensive acquaintance with Burman and Pali literature . He is the most powerful reasoner I have yet met with in this country , excepting my old teacher , Oo Oungmen , ( now dead , ) and he is not at all inferior to him . /z/ " Oct , 23 . At night , Moung Thah-lah and Moung Byaa presented a paper , professing their faith in Jesus Christ , and requesting to be baptized  --  but in private . We spent some time with them . They appear to have experienced divine grace ; but we advised them , as they had so little love to Christ as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and reconsider the matter . " 29 . The teacher came again , after an interval of three weeks ; but he appears to be quite another man . He was mentioned before the Viceroy as having renounced the religion of the country . The Viceroy gave no decisive order ; but merely said , * Inquire further about him . ' This reached the ears of Moung Shwa-gnong , and he directly went to the Mangen teacher , and , I suppose , apologized , and explained , and flattered . He denies that he really recanted , and I hope he did not . But he is evidently falling off from the investigation of the Christian religion . He made but a short visit , and took leave , as soon as he could decently . " Nov. 6 . The two candidates for baptism again presented their urgent petition , that they might be baptized ; not absolutely in private , but about sunset , away from public observation . We spent some hours in again discussing the subject with them , and with one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , and were desirous of receiving this ordinance , purely out of regard to'his command , and their own spiritual welfare ; we felt , that we were all equally exposed to danger , and needed a spirit of mutual candor , and forbearance , and sympathy ; we were convinced , that they were influenced rather by desires of avoiding unnecessary exposure , than by that sinful fear , which would plunge them into apostasy , in the hour of trial ; and when they assured us , that if actually brought before government , they could not think of denying their Saviour , we could not conscientiously refuse their request , and therefore agreed to have them baptized to-morrow at sunset . " 7 . Lord 's day . We had worship as usual , and the people dispersed . About half an hour before sunset the two candidates came to the zayat , accompanied by three or four of their friends ; and , after a short prayer , we proceeded to the spot where Moung Nau was formerly baptized .

Stillness and solemnity pervaded the scene . We felt , on the banks of the water , as a little , feeble , solitary band . But perhaps some hovering angels took note of the event , with more interest than they witnessed the late coronation ; perhaps Jesus looked down on us , pitied and forgave our weaknesses , and marked us for his own ; perhaps , if we deny him not , he will acknowledge us another day , more publicly than we venture at present to acknowledge him . * In the evening , we all united in commemorating the dying love of our Redeemer ; and I trust we enjoyed a little of his gracious presence in the midst of us .

Ever since the affair of Moung Shwa-gnong , there has been an entire falling off at the zayat . I sometimes sit there whole days , without a single visiter , though it is the finest part of the year , and many are constantly passing . ** We and our object are now well known throughout Rangoon . None wish to call , as formerly , out of curiosity ; and none dare to call from a principle of religious inquiry . And were not the leaders in ecclesiastical affairs confident that we shall never succeed in making converts , I have no doubt we should meet with direct persecution and banishment .

Ailer 8e ? eral hours spent in metaphysical cavils , he owned that he did not believe any thing that he had said , and had only been trying me and the religion , being determined to em* brace nothing but what he found unobjectionable and impregnable. * What/ said he , * do you think that I would paj you the least attention , if I found you could not answer all my questions , and solve all my difficulties ? ' He then proceeded to say , that he really believed in God , his Son Jesus Christ , the atonement , &c.; Said I , ( knowing his deistical weakness , ) ' Do you believe all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have given you ? In particular , do you believe that the Son of God died on a cross V ' Ah , ' replied he , ' you have caught me now . I believe that he suffered death , but I can not admit that he * suffered the shameful death of the cross . ' * Therefore/ said I , ' you are not a disciple of Christ . A true disciple inquires not whether a fact is agreeable to his own reason , but whether it is in the book . His pride has yielded to the divine testimony . Teacher , your pride is still unbroken . ' Break down your pride , and yield to the word of God . ' He stopped , and thought . ' As you utter these words , ' said he , * I see my error ; I have been trusting in my own reason , not in the word of God . ' Some interruption now occurred . When we were again alone , he said , ' This day is different from all the days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error in trusting in my own reason ; and I now believe the crucifixion of Christ , because it is contained in the Scripture . ' Some time after , speaking of the uncertainty of life , he said he thought he should not be lost , though he died suddenly . Why ? * Because I love Jesus Christ , Do you really love him ? ' No one that really knows him , can help loving him . ' And so he departed . " Mr. and Mrs. Hough being in Bengal , and the lamented Wheelock having died , Mr. Judson , and his excellent and zealous associate , Mr. Col man , with their wives , were the only Missionaries at Rangoon . It seemed evident , that it " would be in vain to proceed in their missionary labors , unless the favor of the Monarch could be obtained .

On the 22d of December , 1819 , they embarked in a boat six feet wide , and forty feet long , and rowed by ten men . The faithful Moung Nau accompanied them as a servant . They took with them , as a present to his Bnrman Majesty , the Bible , in six volumes , covered with gold leaf , in the Barman style ; and each volume enclosed in a rich wrapper . Several pieces of fine cloth , and other articles , were designed for presents to other members of the government ; as nothing can be done at an oriental court without presents . Their passage up the river was attended with much danger from robbers , who often committed depredations on boats , and usually murdered some of the passengers . But the Lord preserved them from molestation . Mr. Judson , in his journal , thus describes the ruins of Pah-gan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and once the seat of government : " Jan , 18 . Took a survey of the splendid pagodas , and extensive ruins , in the environs of this once famous city . Ascended , as far as possible , some of the highest edifices ; and at the height of one hundred feet , perhaps , beheld all the country round , covered with temples and monuments of every sort and size ; some in utter ruin , some fast decaying , and some exhibiting marks of recent attention and repair . The remains of the ancient wall of the city stretched beneath us . The pillars of the gates , and many a grotesque , dilapidated relic of antiquity , checkered the motley scene . All conspired to suggest those elevated and mournful ideas , which are attendant on a view of the decaying remains of ancient grandeur ; and though not comparable to such ruins as those of Palmyra and Balbec , ( as they are represented , ) still deeply interesting to the antiquary , and more deeply interesting to the Christian Missionary .

" On the 25th of January , 1820 , they arrived safely at Am-* rapora , at that time the capital of the empire , about 350 smiles from Rangoon . It has since been forsaken , and the vcapitai established at Ava , four miles below . The particulars of their interview with the King are so important , that we shall insert them with little alteration . * ' January 26 . We set out early in the morning , and iirpaired to the house of Mya-day-men , former Viceroy of 2laiigoon , now one of the public ministers of state ( Woonyee . ) We gave him a valuable present , and another of Jess Talue to his wife , the lady who formerly treated Mrs. - J. with so much politeness . They both received us very kindly , and appeared to interest themselves in our success . Wq , however , did not disclose our precise object ; but only petitioned for leave to behold the golden face . Upon this , his Highness committed our business to Moung Yo , one of his favoiwte officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one of the private ministers of state ( Atwenwoon , ) with necessary orders . This particular favor of Mya-day-'inen prevents the necessity of our petitioning and feeing aM die public ministers of state , and procuring formal permission from the high court of the empire . /z/ usher in the most eventful day in our lives . eve will close on the hloom or the blight of our Ibodest hopes . Yet it is consoling to commit this- busioesa intothe hands of our heavenly Father ,  --  to feel that the wosk is his , not ours ; that the heart of the monarch , , before whook we are to appear , is under the control of Omnipotence ; . and that the event will be ordered in the manner most condur cive to the divine glory and the greatest good God Biay for the wisest purpose , suffer our hopes to be disappointed ; . and if so , why should short-sighted , mortal man repkie t Thy will , O God , be ever done ; for thy wilL is inevitably the wisest and the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put oursekres ondei ihe conduct of Moung Yo . He carried us first to Myardaymen , as a matter of form ; and there we lean , that the Emperor had been privately apprized of our arrival , , and said , * Let them be introduced/ We therefore proceeded to the palace . At the outer gate we were detained a longtime , until the various officers were satisfied thai we had right to enter ; after which we deposited a present for the private minister of state , Moung Zah , and were ushered into his apartments in the palace-yard . He received us very pleasantly , and ordered us to sit before several Governors and petty Kings , who were waiting at his kvee . We here , for the first time , disclosed our character and object  - -  told him , that we were Missionaries , or ' propagators of religion ; ' that we wished to appear before the Emperor and present our sacred books , accompanied with a petition . He took the petition into his hand , looking over about half of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our religion , to which we replied . Just at this crisis , some one announced that the golden foot was about to advance ; on which the minister hastily rose upland put on his robes of state , saying , that he must seize the moment to present us to the Emperor . We now found that we had unwittingly fallen on an unpropitious time , it being the day of the celebration of the late victory over the Cassays , and the very hour , when his Majesty was coming forth , to witness the display made on the occasion . When the minister was dressed , he just said , ' How can you propagate religion in this empire ? But come along . ' Our hearts sunk . at these inauspicious words . He conducted us through various splendor and parade , until we ascended a flight of stairs , and entered a most magnificent hall . He directed us where to sit and took his place on one side ; /z/ the present was placed on the other , and Moung Yo , and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene to which we were now introduced , really surpassed our expectation . The spacious extent of the haJl , the number and magnitude of the pillars , the height of the dome , the whole completely covered with gold , presented a most grand and imposing spectacle . Very few were present , and those evidently great officers of state . Our situation prevented us from seeing the farther avenue of the hall ; but the end where we sat opened into the parade , which the Emperor was about to inspect . We remained about five minutes , when every one put himself into the most respectful attitude , and Moung Yo whispered , that his Majesty had entered . We looked through the hall , as far as the pillars would allow , and presently caught sight of this modern Ahasuerus . He came forward , unattended  - -  in solitary grandeur  --  - exhibiting the proud gait and majesty of an eastern monarch . His dress was rich , but not distinctive ; and he carried in his hand the goldnsheathed sword , which seems to have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his high aspect and commanding eye , that chiefly rivetted our attention . He strided on . Every head , excepting ours , was now in the dust . We remained kneeling , our hands folded , our eyes fixed on the monarch . When hedrew near , we caught his attention . He stopped , partly turned towards us  --  * Who are these V * The teachers , great King , * I replied . * What , you speak Burman  --  the priests that I heard of last night V ' When did you arrive V * Are you teachers of religion V * Are you like the Portuguese priests ? ' ' Are you married ? ' * Why do you dress so V These , and some other similar questions , we answered ; when he appeared to be pleased with us , and sat down on an elevated seat  --  his hand resting on the hilt of his sword , and his eyes intently fixed on us . Moung Zah now began to read the petition , and it ran thus :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the excellent King , the Sovereign of land and sea . Hearing that , on account of the greatness of the royal power , the royal country was in a quiet and prosperous state , we arrived at the town of Rangoon , within the royal dominions ; and having obtained leave of the Governor of that town , to come up and behold the golden face , we have ascended , and reached the bottom of the golden feet . /q/ In the great country of America , we socttain the character of teachers and explainers of the cmtents of the sacred Scriptures of our religion And since it is contained in those Scriptures , that , if we pass to other countries , and preach and propagate religion , great good will result , and both those who teach and those who receive the religion , wUl be freed from future punishment , and enjoy , without decay or death , the eternal felicity of heaven ,  --  that royal permission be given , that we , taking refuge in the royal power , may preach our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with our preaching , and wish to listen to and be guided by it , whether foreigners or Burmans , may be exempt from government molestation , they present themselves to receive the favor of the excellent King , the Sovereign of land and sea . ' " The Emperor heard this petition , and stretched out his hand . Moung Zah crawled forward and presented it . His Majesty began at the top , and deliberately read it through . In the mean time , I gave Moung Zah an abridged copy of the tract , in which every offensive sentence was corrected , and the whole put into the handsomest style and dress possible . Afler the Emperor had perused the petition he handed it back , without saying a word , and took the tract . Our hearts now rose to God , for a display of his grace . * O , have mercy on Burmah ! Have mercy on her King 1 ' But , alas ! the time was not yet come . He held the tract long enough to read the two first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , who is independent of the incidents of mortality , and that , besides hun , there is no God ; and then with an air of indifference , perhaps disdain , he dashed it down to the ground ! Moung Zah stod forward , picked it up , and handed it to us . Moung Yo made a slight attempt to save us , by unfolding one of the volumes which composed our present , and displaying its beauty ; but his Majesty took no notice . Our fate was decided . Afler a few moments , Moung Zah interpreted his royal master 's will , in the following terms : ' In regard to the objects of your petition , his Majesty gives no order . In regard to your sacred books , hiis Majesty has no use for them  --  take them away . ' ' ' Something was now said about brother Colman 's skill in medicine ; upon which the " Etapot once more opened his mouth , and said , ' Let them proceed to the residence of /z/ my physician , the Portuguese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me in that line , and report accordingly . ' He then rose from his seat , strided on to the end of the hall , and there , after having dashed to the ground the first intelligence that he had ever received of the eternal God , his Maker , his Preserver , his Jadge , ha threw himself down on a cushion , and lay listening to the music , and gazing at the parade spread out before him . * ' As for us and our presents , we were hurried away without much ceremony . We passed out of the palace gates with much more facility than we entered , and were conducted first to the house of Mya-day-men . There his officer reported our reception ; but in as favorable terms as possible ; and as his Highness was not apprized of our precise object , our repulse appeared , probably , to him , not so decisive as we knew it to be . We were next conducted two miles , through the sun and dust of the streets of Ava , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were in possession of no wonderful secret , which would secure the Emperor from all disease , and make him live forever ; and we were accordingly allowed to take leave of the reverend Inquisitor , and retreat to our boat . " The next day , they made some other efforts to accom* plish their object , but in vain . " We ascertained , beyond a doubt , that the policy of the Burman government , in regard to the toleration of any foreign religion , is precisely the same with the Chinese ; that it is quite out of the question , whether any of the subjects of the Emperor , who embrace a religion different from his own , will be exempt from punishment ; and that we , in presenting a petition to that effect , had been guilty of a most egregious blunder  --  an unpardonable offence . " It was now evening . We had four miles to walk by moon-light . Two of our disciples only followed us . They had pressed as near as they ventured to the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed the extinctbn of their hopes and ours . For some time we spoke not . ' Some natural tears we dropped , but wiped them toon . The world was all before us , where to choose Our place of rest , and Providence our guide . ' /q/ And , as our first parents took their solitary way through Eden , hand in hand , so we took our way through this great , city , which , to our late imagination , seemed another Eden ; but now , through the magic touch of disappointment , seemed blasted and withered , as if smitten by the fatal influence of the cherubic sword . " Arrived at the boat , we threw ourselves down , completely exhausted in body and mind . For three days we had walked eight miles a day , the most of the way in the heat of the sun ; which , even at this season , in the interior of these countries , is exceedingly oppressive ; and the result of our travels and toils has been  --  the wisest and best possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end from the beginning , would call forth our highest praise . O , slow of heart to believe and trust in the over-ruling agency of our own Almighty Saviour ! " An incident which occurred about fifteen years before , shows the policy of the Burman government respecting religion . * ' The Roman Catholic priests converted to their faith a Burman teacher of talents and distinction . They took great pains to indoctrinate him thoroughly in their religion , and entertained great hope of his usefulness in their cause . After his return from Rome , whither they had sent him to complete his Christian education , he was accused by his nephew , a clerk in the high court of the empire , of having renounced the established religion . The Emperor , though he was far from approving the religion of Boodh , ordered that he should be compelled to recant . The nephew seized bis uncle , cast him into prison and fetters , caused him to be beaten and treated unmercifully ; and at length had recourse to the torture of the iron mall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends of his feet up to his breast , until his body was little else but one livid wound . At every blow , the sufferer pronounced the name of Christ ; and declared afterwards , that he felt but little or no pain . When he was at the point of death , under the hands of his tormentors , some persons who pitied his case , went to the Emperor with a statement that he was a madman , and knew not what he was about ; on which the Emperor gave orders for his release . The Portuguese took him away , concealed him until he was able to move , then sent him privately in a boat to Rangoon , and thence by ship to Bengal , where he finished his days . // * ' After this occurreoce , the Romao priests , of whom there were only four in the country , did nothing in the way of ro8elyting , but confined their labors to their own flocks which were composed of the descendants of foreigners . The man who accused his uncle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first of the private ministers of state . Furthermore , the chief Queen , who had great influence with his Majesty , was particularly attached to the religion and the priests of Boodh . " So hopeless was the prospect of obtaining permission from the Burman government to preach the Gospel to its subjects , that the Missionaries resolved to return immediately to Rangoon . The passage down the river was rapid . At Pyee , 230 miles from Ava , they met the teacher , Moung Shwa-gnong , who had come from Rangoon , on a visit to a sick friend . " We stated to him , " says Mr. Judson , " all our adven* tures at court , the distressing result of the expedition , and the present danger of prcgating or professing the religioa of Christ , and wound off with the story of the iron mall . He appeared to be less affected and intimidated by the rela tion , than we could have expected . " He repeated with considerable emphasis the most prom-i inent points of his present faith , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his Son Jesus Christ , in the atonement which Christ has made , and in the writings of the apostles as the true and only word of God . ' * Perhaps , ' continued he , ' you may not remember , that during one of my last visits , you told me that I was trusting in my own understanding , rather than the divine word . From that time , I have seen my error , and endeavored to renounce it . Tou explained to me also the evil of worshipping at pagodas , though I told you that my heart did not partake in the worship . Since you lefl Rangoon , I have not lifted up my folded hands before a pagoda . It is true , I sometimes follow the crowd , on days of worship , in order to avoid peraecntion ; but I walk up one side of the pagoda , and walk down the other . Now , you say that I am not a disciple . What lack I yetf I was now satisfied that he had made  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a eorresponding advance on my side . I replied , therefore , * Teacher , you may be a disciple of Christ in heart , but you are not a full disciple . You have not faith and resolution /q/ enough to keep all the commands of Christ , particularly that which requires you to be baptized , though in the face of persecution and death . Consider the words of Jesus just before he returned to heaven , He that believethy and is baptized , shall he saved . He received this communication in profound silence , and with that air , which I have observed to come upon him , when he takes a thing into serious consideration . Soon after , I hinted our intention of leaving Rangoon , since the Emperor had virtually prohibited the propagation of the Christian religion , and no Burman , under such circumstances , would dare to investigate , much less to embrace it . This intelligence evidently roused him , and showed us that we had more interest in his heart than we thought . ' Say not so , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notwithstanding ; and rather than have you quit Rangoon , I will go myself to the Mangen teacher , and have a public dispute . I know I can silence him . I know the truth is on my side . ' ' Ah , ' said I , ' you may have a tongue to silence him , but he has a pair of fetters , and an iron mall to subdue you . Remember that . " On the 18th of February , they arrived at Rangoon . They immediately called the three disciples together , and * disclosed to them the melancholy result of their visit . They stated to them their design of leaving Rangoon , and endeavoring to establish a mission in a tract of country , containing about 1,200,000 inhabitants , between Bengal and Arracan , which is under the government of Bengal , but is inhabited chiefly by Arracanese , who speak a language similar to the Burman . A Missionary from Bengal , ( De Bruyn ) formerly resided at Chittagong , the chief town in this district , and baptized several converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They expected that the disciples would be intimidated by the refusal of the Emperor to tolerate the Christian religion . Mr. J. says : ** We thought that if one out of the three remained firm , it was as much as we could reasonably hope for . But how delightfully were we disappointed . They all , to a man , appeared immoveably the same , yea , rather advanced in zeal and energy . They vied with each other , in trying to explain away difficulties , and to convince us , that the cause was not yet quite desperate . ' But whither are the teachers /z/ 17D MBBCOIR OF ME8 . JUIMUIf. going V was , of course , an anxious inquiry . We then asked them severally what they would do . Moung Nau had previously told us , that he would follow us to any part of the world . He was only afraid that he should be a burden to ns ; for , not being acquainted with another language , henight not be able to get his living in a strange land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go where preaching is to be had . ' Moung Byaa was silent and thoughtful . At last he said , that as no Burman woman is allowed to leave the country , he could not , on account of his wife , follow the teachers ; but ( continued he , with some pathos , ) if I must be left here alone , I shall remain performing the duties of Jesus Christ 's religion ; no other shall I think of . This interview with the disciples rejoiced our hearts , and caused us to praise God for the grace which he has manifested to them . " It was soon ascertained , that the converts were unanimously desirous that the Missionaries should not forsake the station at present ; and that several individuals were examining the new religion . Moung Byaa came to them , with his brother-in-law , Moung Myat-yah : " ' Teacher , ' said he , " my mind is distressed ; I can neither eat nor sleep , since I find you are going away . I have been around among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even now examining the new religion . Brother Myat-yah is one of them , and he unites with me in my petitions . ( Here Myat-yah assented that it was so . ) Do stay with us a few months . Do stay till there are eight or ten disciples . Then appoint one to be the teacher of the rest ; I shall not be concerned about the event ; though you should leave the country , the religion will spread of itself . The Emperor himself can not stop it . But if you go now , and take the two disciples that can follow , I shall be left alone . I can not baptize those who may wish to embrace this religion . What can I do V Moung Nau came in , and expressed himself in a similar way . He thought that several would yet become disciples , notwithstanding all opposition , and that it was best for us to stay a while . We could not restrain our tears at hearing all this ; and we told them , that as we lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burmans , if there was any pros* pect of success in Rangoon , we had no desire to go to any other place , and would , therefore , reconsider the matter . " /q/ Thus , at the moment when nitn seemed to threaten the mission , the Lord was strengthening the hearts of the ooQverts , and encouraging the Missionaries to remain at their posts , and proceed in the work of teaching the re* iigion of the Gospel , trusting in his power for protection . It was finally resolved , that Mr. and Mrs. Judson should continue at Rangoon , and that Mr. and Mrs. Colman should proceed to Chtttagong , and form a station there , at which the other Missionaries , and the converts , might find a refuge , should it be found impossible to remain at Rangoon , and where the Gospel might be spread among a population as idolatrous and wretched as that of Burmah itself Ac* cordingly , in March , 1820 , Mr. and Mrs. Colman embarked for Bengal , whence thej proceeded to Chittagong , where they arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the native popuhition , and made rapid progress in the acquisition of the language , which was commenced while in Rangoon . Mr. Colman had begun to communicate the truths of the Gospel publicly , and had witnessed their effect on the mind of his teacher , when these animating prospects were blasted by the sudden and lamented death of this valuable Missionary . In Chittagong , he might have lived comfortably in civilized Christian society , under the protection of the English government , and been usefully employed in missionary avocations . But , in imitation of the Redeemer , and prompted by feelings of compassion for immortal souls , he chose his residence in a native village . Cox 's Bazar , where he was surrounded by poverty , ignorance and delusion , and where , too , he fell a martyr to his zeal , July 4 , 1822 . Mrs. Colman returned to Bengal , where she engaged , with great zeal , in the instruction of female children . She was afterwards married to the Rev. Mr. Sutton , an English Baptist Missionary in Hindostan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rangoon ; though their solitude was cheered by the affectionate attachment of the converted Burmans , and by the appearances of sincere inquiry in the minds of several others . The teacher , Moung Shwa-gnong , became gradually settled and firm in his faith , though he still hesitated to be baptized . Another learned casuist , named Oo Yan , visited Mr. Judson , and disputed with him , with much subtlety and zeal . /z/ " He was ready to admit , that the atheistic system of the Boodhists was not tenable ; but endeavored to fortify himself on a middle system , between that and the Christian ; the very system in which Moung Shwa-gnong formerly rested , and which , for distinction 's sake , may be fitly termed the semi-atheistic . Its fundamental doctrine is , that divine wisdom , not concentrated in any existing spirit , or embodied in any form , but diffused throughout the universe , and partaken in different degrees by various intelligences , and in a very high degree by theBoodhs , is the true and only God . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oo Yan made every possible effort to keep alive ; but I really think , that in his own mind he felt the case to be hopeless . His mode of reasoning , however , is soil , insinuating , and acute ; and so adroitly did he act his part , that Moung Shwa-gnong , with his strong arm , and I , with the strength of truth , were scarcely able to keep him down . ** March 15 . Another visit from the teacher , accompanied by his wife and child . Again discussed the necessity of assembling on the Lord 's day . Found that t/q/
