WHEN the first volume of these " Notices " was issued in 1836 , the public was informed , that the second volume would follow " with all convenient despatch , " - a phrase of most convenient latitude , though probably , in the opinion of that l ) ublic at least , not warranting the four years which have deferred the fulfilment of its expectations . No title could be more modest and unpretending , than that which has been assumed for this work , none which could authorize a more summary or detached treatment of the subject in hand , as it admits of almost any selection or omission of the various facts presented , and any method of comment upon them . Accordingly , the author has made his work rather a military critique than a history , the several prominent campaigns of the war being something like texts for his critical commentaries . // It is said , with much truth , that " the late war*** has not yet been made the subject of history . Many detached accounts have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian . These " Notices , " sententious and unpretending as they are , may perhaps be regarded as the nearest approach to a connected record of the military events of that period , which the public has received . Symptoms , however , have already appeared ( on the publication of the first volume ) , which show that its correctness or fairness is questioned , and even openly impeached . We do not think that a veteran soldier , well versed in the doubts and contradictions that envelope the deeds of war , especially battles , will be surprised at this . He must know , that probably no battle , in which more than a company , or so , has been engaged , has ever been related in precisely the same manner by two witnesses . The difficulties in the way of agreement , in these descriptions , are obvious . Military engagements have much to occupy and confuse the attention . Scarcely any two persons are likely to observe the same occurrences , at least under the same aspects . Nearly every one , excepting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less limited portions of the field , and can not be supposed , under the deep responsibility resting upon him to sustain with all his energy and devotion the distinct part allotted to him , to have cast more than hasty glances at other parts , which could probably be but imperfectly seen even under a more steady examination . Those who have had some experience in military events , and have been accustomed to reflect on the difficulties here referred to , and the hopeless task of endeavouring to record them , in all their details , with perfect truth , or so as to reconcile the testimony of all spectators , will feel convinced , that little more than the main results of such events will at last be satisfactorily fixed in history . Contemporaneous accounts are ever conflicting , and it is only after they have been taken up with some of the sobermindedness and impnrtiality of posterity , and brought into a degree of conformity with those results , * This phrase , " the late war , " which was very appropriate many years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less propriety , 01 course , each year , - by the officers engaged in that war , partly from habit , and tartly . perhaps , from a faint hope that it will disguise the quarter ofa centary that has elapsed since it closed . // that the record becomes authoritative , or generally received as determinate . When new generations have sprung up , there is little interest felt in questions as to personal character , or pretensions of rival corps . The strongest appeals may he made for the reversion of what are termed hasty and unwarral ) ted judgments , yet a work of established reputation and wide circulation is likely to prevail as the standard of history , in spite of the supposed errors it may have sanctioned , or the imputed wrongs it may have inflicted . General Armstrong 's qualifications for writing a history of the war of 1812 , would appear to be very manifest . He bore an elevated and active part in that war ; and had long been recognised as a skilful writer , having given , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , while an officer of the revolutionary army . An apprehension was felt , by many , that his somewhat caustic humor would be likely to infuse too much severity into his accounts . It was notorious , that he had enemies whom he might wish to punish , and he was supposed to have friends , whom he might be well pleased to reward ;  --  feelings which most naturally exercise an unfavorable influence over the strict justice of a writer 's decisions . How far the charge of having submitted to influences of this kind lies against the distinguished author of the " Notices , " we shall have occasion to remark as we pass them under review . We believe that , when the first volume appeared , it was generally admitted to have been written in a more moderate and liberal spirit than had been anticipated . From a brief but distinct account of the " causes of the war , " the historian proceeds to the condition of the defences of the country at the time when hostilities were undertaken . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much prudence as we had received provocation . In this respect , there was little to say to our credit . The author of the " Notices " might have justly and properly dwelt with still greater severity on the singular want of this quality , which was exhibited in nearly all our preparations for this war of our own choosing . Had the initiative been taken by our antagonist , many excuses might rise up in our favor . The time , however , was our own choice . It was deferred or hastened at our own option . We are well aware of the often stated unsuitableness of a government , constituted like ours , for warlike preparation . it is not to legislative reluc // tance or tardiness to act until the hour of extreme necessity arrives , that we here allude . All acknowledge this , and it is in vain to reiterate lamentations over it . We are now regarding only executive agency in such cases . Here are few or none of the clogs that embarrass other departments of the government . The Executive has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means confided to its hands for national defence , with the utmost necessary latitude . The army and navy , whatever may be their force , are at its command . When the war with Great Britain was approaching , and considered unavoidable , were those means prepared , strengthened , and applied to the emergency with due care , forecast , and energy ? This is a question which it is proper to ask , and which it is the province of history to answer , for the benefit of posterity . Our army , at the opening of hostilities , was small , but had been unnecessarily and inexcusably reduced below its legal force , by a relaxation in the recruiting service during the years immediately preceding them . It is a singular fact , that , between 1809 and 1812 , within which interval there was scarcely a moment when our foreign relations , particularly with England , were not of a threatening and alarming character , the Secretary of War reported funds , appropriated by Congress for this service , as having been unexpended , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of its proper complement . We had , nevertheless , some few thousands of men who had much efficiency , being well oflicered , and accustomed to subordination . We had maritime fortifications , and some on the interior frontier , - imperfect and dilapidated , it is true , hut capable of defence . As soon as war was declared , the navy went forth in full readiness for battle . So far , the executive arm was fully nerved . But on land , no post , no corps , was awakened to heed by any precautionary orders . The fact , that many of our out-posts were behind antagonist posts in hearing of the declaration of ivar , is sufficiently mortifying , but should not have lessened the ability of each one to meet the emergency according to its means . It was not necessary that this declaration should be made , in order that every soldier should he on the qui vive , that every arm should be put in serviceable order , and that the national defences should be in a condition to meet hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // because the British first heard the news of war , as there was certainly no reason why the wings of Mercury should have been formed in readiness to waft it on one side only . Months before the outbreak , the commanding officer of that post might have been forewarned of the necessity of vigilance and preparation , and should have had ( as in fact he had ) no excuse for allowing an armed body of men to approach his post with so little observation , as to knock at his gate before its presence was even suspected . Such an approach , which ought to have been duly seen , was a sufficient proclamation of hostility , at least so far as regarded that post . Resistance , under such circumstances , became justifiable and even imperative , whether a national war existed or not . This remote and important post had been permitted to slumber in fancied security , without any efforts to strengthen its decayed defences , and had only a subaltern in command at the time it was taken . The most common dictates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outer wall , when danger was approaching , and even close at hand . Btit war seems to have found our army , most of our maritime fortifications , and all our frornier posts , just as many years of peace had left them . They were all nearly , or quite , as unprepared for such an event , as if there had been no reason to apprehend that that peace would soon end . It is of want of preparation in these respects , that we complain ,  --  a want that finds no excuse in any defects of our republican government . Our army , - several thousands strong , as we have before remarked , - might have been in perfect readiness for action , and all our posts could have been well apprized of the necessity of being constantly prepared for defence . A change from the state of peace to that of war , should have been supposed to make no other change in their condition , than that of giving them the authority to act on the offensive . Fitness for defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the circumstance that General Hull , when advancing to the northwestern frontier , did not receive intelligence of the declaration of war as soon as the British ; though we dwell with amazement on the blunders of the arrangement , which , starting off two letters written by the war department to him , on the 18th of June , one communicating information of the declaration of war ( declared on that day ) , and the other silent on that subject , permitted the latter to // reach him on the 24th of that month , and left the former to loiter on the route until the 2d of July . The " Notices " account for this inversion of the rule of speed , by stating that the last letter went by an express or private hand , while the first was abandoned to the ordinary mail facilities , which terminated at Cleveland at that time . Chance , or special instructions , alone provided for any advance beyond that point . The calculations of the War Department doubtless were , that the mail would outstrip the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have demanded an arrangement that should have outstripped both these means . rVhe loss of the schooner and its contents , which was consequent on the omission to inform General Hull of the war in the shortest possible time , would have defrayed the extra expense of such despatch many times over . We think , however , that General Hull was engaged in an expedition that called for nearly all the vigilance and precaution of a state of avowed hostility . He was advancing , at a time when such a state of things was hourly expected , with a strong force , on a point which threatened a weak flank of the quasi enemy , and had reason to anticipate a readiness on the part of the British to take advantage of the first hint of a rupture . It was clearly his duty to be prepared for open hostility , and to have iiicurred no hazard which that state of things would have forbidden . Disincumbering his army , about to take a march through a wilderness of some seventy miles , by embarking his sick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excusable tneasure ; but there was no excuse for exposing his returns and confidential papers to any hazards at all . This was a miscalculation that amounted to wanton heedlessness . The capture of those papers no doubt eventually turned the scale of the campaign . Instructions , returns , correspondence , - all that an adroit enemy could wish to acquire , were there thrown into his possession ; proving a want of ordinary foresight , and , it is said , so many other defects . of character in his antagonist , as to warrant General Brock , in that hardy , almost fool-hardy , course of operations , with which he shortly afterwards overawed rather than overpowered that antagonist . The critical remarks with which this first chapter ( after a manner that prevails throughout the work ) is closed , will probably receive the assent of most military men . They are // based on maxims which are admitted to have weight , and which can not be violated with impunity . In this opening of the war on the northwestern frontier , the author sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Maguaga , which was well fought and successful , the main body of the regulars there having already tried their courage and steadiness at Tippecanoe . The errors of government , as well as of General Hull , are passed under this critical review . The " Notices " do not repeat the common remark , that the appointment of this general was one of those errors . The author 's revolutionary recollections led him to know that General Hull stood high , for his rank , in the opinion of one whose estimation was considered as decisive of merit . The position he held at the time of his appointment in Michigan peculiarly fitted him for the command confided to him . The capital error was , omitting to make any efforts to secure ascendancy on Lake Erie . A little forecast , and a little expense , would have effected this object . Another , and hardly less error was , omitting to occupy the enemy on the Niagara frontier . His force there was liberated hy an armistice just in time to become applicable to the northwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious to those who committed it . The last was a blunder that seems to mock all attempts at justification or palliation . The " Notices " dwell long and somewhat minutely on the disastrous campaign of the northwest . Misfortunes would be dearly bought indeed , if they were not made subservient to the instruction of posterity . The general who has connected his name prominently with them must be content to point the moral . This is the best compensation he can make for his miscalculations or ill luck . General Hull 's surrender , darkened by the like fate of Mackinaw , and the miserable tragedy at Chicago , and scarcely relieved by the gallant but fruitless success at Maguaga , came upon the public like a heavy fog ; preparing it , however , for the calamities that followed at the River Raisin . The " Notices " take up the narration of this melancholy sequence to Hull 's campaign , with an evident desire to vindicate General Winchester at the expense of higher authority . The anxiety on the I ) art of General Winchester to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut could have been safely // indulged only by throwing forward a force competent to meet that which was well known to be at Maiden . Frenchtown , left to itself , would doubtless have suffered , though the laws of war protect an unresisting people from violence . Ineffectual protection , however , is worse than utter abandonment . The unhappy residents of that place suffered , in the end , tenfold calamity , in consequence of their importunity for protection . The criticisms of the veteran author on this train of evils have much force and correctness . He exhibits most obviously the errors committed in the arrangements for the second action , which , with better dispositions , might have resulted so differently . We are surprised , however , to see the speech of Colonel Allen inserted ; not that the speech itself , as given , is not eloquent , and of a generous spirit . Addresses of this kind , purporting to usher in a military movement , have long since been omitted , as unnecessarily encumbering historic narration . Besides , in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed a grave military council . These criticisms , however , as we have before remarked , exhibit throughout a tinge of disfavor towards the General-in-chief on that frontier . The misfortunes of General Winchester are made to hinge on movements of the commanding general , when the commonly received opinion is , that they were produced by a departure froni express instructions from that quarter . It was not intended that General Winchester should obtrude himself , in that attenuated form , within reach of the enemy ; and when , through an excited or liberal spirit , he resolved to incur hazards not strictly warranted by his instructions , or the rules of war , he became responsible for all the misfortune or disgrace which followed . If at any moment the steps he had taken were sanctioned by his senior , it was doubtless . when Colonel Lewis 's gallant repulse of the first attempts of the enemy to dislodge him , encouraged a belief that General Proctor was less strong or less enterprising than there had been just reason to expect . Notwithstanding all the kind efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that responsibility which has generally been fixed upon him , by public opinion , as to the River Raisin events , we believe that that opinion will remain the same . It was his act which led to the occupation of this salient point , and it was his disposition of the troops before the second attack by General Proctor , that would // appear to have led to that general 's triumph and his own captivity . Nor can his order , or recommendation , - let it assume what name it may , - dictated , as it was , under the threats of his captor , and sent in to the battalion of brave men still defending the stockade , ever he justified upon any military principles , or even any reasons of expediency . His command had ceased , as well as his capacity to judge of what might be expedient or necessary on the part of those , who were then apart from his observation , and as independent of his control as if he had no longer existed . Captivity as effectually forecloses all authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have confided in the judgment of men , who , hy their conduct , had shown themselves his superiors in skill , if not in bravery , and must have known that his message , however couched , whether in authoritative or recommendatory language , when sent in under such circumstances , would most naturally have a dispiriting influence over his late comrades , whose straitened condition called for every incentive to daring , even to a desperation of perseverance . The commander , whose want of heed or adroitness has led to his capture , should not increase the evils his ill luck or unskilfulness have drawn upon his command , by taking any steps which may involve others in the same predicament . General Winchester , when he could no longer he instrumental of good , should not have permitted himself to be instrumental of evil , as he undoubtedly did , though from kind motives . But such motives are not to govern under such stern circumstances of war . The simultaneous retreat of the two helligerents , General Harrison from the Rapids , and General Proctor from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did , a seeming misapprehension on both sides , - furnishes the veteran author with ground for much severity of comment . No doubt one of the parties , at least , could have safely avoided such a retrograde . But circumstances are not always obvious until it is too late . In the present instances , it was not without reason that both parties came to the conclusion that prudence required a falling hack upon stronger ground . General Proctor , notwithstanding his success , had reason to apprehend that his enemy , only a part of whose strength he had met , would be moving rapidly forward to arrest or avenge the disasters , which the imprudence of his advance seemed likely to bring on . He therefore withdrew with his captives and booty to Malden . On the // other hand , General Harrison , weakened by the destruction of his advance corps , and knowing that the ice made an easy communication along the lake shore with the Maumee , had ground for distrusting his ability to defend a position which had been but imperfectly established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise bespoke much confidence in his own strength . Events proved this abandonment unnecessary , at least , at that time , though it is not certain that , had the Maumee continued to be occupied , the attack , made the following season , would not have been made that winter . It was undoubtedly better to sacrifice the stores which had been collected there , difficult and expensive as had been their collection , than to expose raw troops to the chances of a second disaster . The reoccupation of the same ground the February following repaired the fault , if one had been committed . The operations in this quarter the spring ensuing were full of interest and consequences . The investment of Fort Meigs by General Proctor was begun with spirit , little answering its impotent conclusion . One of the incidents accompanying this investment is conspicuous for the instruction it affords . The attack directed to be made by Colonel Dudley 's regiment on the left bank of the river was well devised , and promised the happiest results , though converted into a deplorable reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " Notices " dwell on this subordinate disaster with a just desire to exhibit , in the strongest light , the destructive consequences of disobedience to orders in military affairs . An officer who assumes the responsibility of departing from orders , when he is performing only a part in some plan of attack or defence , becomes at once as disqualified for his position as a horse for the race , when it has burst all restraints of the bridle . Colonel Dudley 's part was nearly consummated when he surprised the enemy 's batteries , which he could have rendered useless , and then effected a secure retreat . Remaining on the ground , from a mistaken and arrogant idea that an initial success insures a continued triumph , he dallied and skirmished , until , being surrounded , he lost all he had gained , and nearly the whole of his detachment also . This recklessness and folly on one bank did not frustrate the plan of attack on the other . General Proctor was sufficiently discouraged by these evidences of strength and enterprise in his antagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that quarter ; first , however , trying the effect of a summons to surrender , under cover of which he effected his retreat without molestation . The habit of summoning places to surrender , so often resorted to by the British in this war , is severely condemned by the author of the " Notices , " particularly when , no attempt being made at a subsequent enforcement , the summons wears the aspect of an empty bravado . When General Hull proclaimed to the inhabitants of Canada that he could " look down all opposition , " it behoved him to look well to his after movements , and especially to see that he succumbed to no appearances , but only to the stern reality of superior power . But General Brock , who had discerned the weak points of his enemy , which lay rather in his morale than his physique , believed that a trumpet would shake down the walls before him as effectually as his cannon . In this he was not mistaken . General Proctor may have borne this in mind , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat of the tomahawk overcame all resistance . Or , what is more probable , after the proofs he had seen of the firmness of his adversary , he may have intended only to raise a smoke to cover his meditated retreat . We are warranted to conclude , from the use he made of this attempt at a parley , that he anticipated no other benefits from it . It was a successful stratagem , and as such , creditable to his tact in war . We have permitted ourselves to dwell so long on the scenes of the northwestern frontier , - scenes which , though they minister nothing to our pride , are profitable to dwell upon , - that we have little room for turning back upon the operations of General Van Rensselaer and General Smythe , which are fruitful themes of animadversion to the author of the " Notices . " And well may he hold then ) up to unsparing condemnation . The amiable and excellent patriot who conducted , or rather permitted , the attack on Queenstown , showed his willingness to peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which were , no doubt , entirely beyond his comprehension . Though free to set an example , that might help to fill up the ranks of the Levies , then so earnestly called for by the government , and thus become a general maigre ' lui , yet he probably had little share in planning the attempt on Canada , which has given his name such an undesired and inappropriate celebrity . The " Notices " fully expose the character of this // affair ; its want of proper object ; its deficiency of available means to compass it , shadowy as it was ; the extreme confusion and insubordination that marked its progress ; but also acknowledge the instances of gallantry and good conduct ( usplayed by a few regulars , who succeeded , with still fewer equally gallant volunteers , in taking the enemy 's batteries ; only , however , to be unnecessarily abandoned to captivity . Q ueenstown is a name that should not be forgotten , though remembered with mortification , it suggests a lesson of instruction which may not arise from the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author of the " Notices " to a new interest in his work . quorum pars fuzt . The active agency which the Secretary of War had in planning the operations of the war during that year are well recollected ; nor has it been forgotten , that his ardent zeal , overstepping ordinary limits , gave to an office before supposed to have only a local habitation , an ambulatory character , which detached the War Department for a time from the Cabinet , and fixed it in the tented field . The l ) lans of this campaign were undoubtedly highly creditable to the sagacity and military acumen of the mind which originated them . They looked to attainable objects , which were likely to be beneficial when attained , and proposed aml ) le means for their attainment . We now refer more particularly to the campaign on Lake Ontario . Though the Secretary of War laid down the pJan of operations at Washington , yet he most properly left some discretion to the General in command , who thought proper to depart in a degree from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning , an ( l unlucky in the end , is the question to he answered . The " Notices " endeavour to prove the affirmative , and with an earnestness that bespeaks something like an apprehension that any other answer would recoil upon the War Department . We do not however , see that in this case , judex damnatur , if the General were acquitted . It is probably a false view of the subject , to suppose that praise or blame ensues according to the success with which the plan was executed . The views entertained at Washington were doubtless correct , according to appearances presenting themselves there . To the general commanding on the spot other views might present themselves . Kingston , York , and Fort George , was unquestionably the natural series , looking only to the effect of crippling the enemy most effectually in detail . The // all of the lower places almost insured the fall of those above . One blow on the trunk of a tree goes further towards its destruction than many on its branches . All , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingston was at that time defended by a fleet as well as by land forces . That fleet was nearly equal to our own . Commodore Chauncy might have considered the disparity in his favor more than made up , - as it no doubt was , - by the batteries then ready to cooperate with his antagonist . There were many reasons which justified a departure from the original plan . Something like the main body of the forces with which General Dearborn was to operate was upon the Niagara frontier . It may be asked , why they were not all concentrated upon Sackett 's Harbour . Had such been the case at the opening of the campaign , these forces must have been dependent for all their movements on the fleet , - a very inadequate transportation . General Dearborn , no doubt , regarded his land force at Sackett 's Harbour as sufficient for the capture of York ( Toronto ) , and knew that the fleet could easily transport it . Proposing only the reduction of that comparatively small place , the capture of its public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel on the stocks , ) and also , if possible , its garrison , Fort George was his next object . Being of much greater importance , having a strong fort and a large garrison , the force to be brought against it must be augmented in proportion . This augmentation he would find at Niagara . In the mean time , it was expected that Sir James Yeo would be out , and met on the broad lake . A victory over him there would deprive Kingston of half its defence , and render its reduction comparatively easy and certain . These were probably among the prevailing motives , which induced the general commanding to change the order of attack in some degree . Pursuing the order prescribed at Washington , he might have failed , - indeed , with only the force he had at Sackett 's Harbour , no doubt he would have failed , - in the beginning ; a failure that would have cost him the canipaign . The change insured success in the first step ; made the second nearly as certain ; and multiplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , we think General Dearborn exercised a sound discretion . Whether the execution of the plan thus changed was as prompt and energetic as it might have been , and ought to have been , is another ques // LJuly , tion , but which is best answered by following the order of events as they arise . It was evident , Fort George being threatened as well as Kingston , that the enemy must hold the garrisons of those two places , and of York also , immovable , until some decisive demonstration should show the object of immediate attack . Cooperation would then , of course , be too late . Each post must stand on its own resources . The embarkation was made as soon as the navigation opened in the spring , but with no published designation of its object , unless Kingston , by way of feint , were given out as that which wias in yew . York was carried without difficulty , and the loss sustained was owing principally to the explosion that took place after the landing had been fully made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they seem to imply that the-Commander-in-chief should have been with the landing party . The force was no more than a Brigadier-general 's command , and was specially put under the immediate charge of an officer of that rank , who was peculiarly competent for the station . General Dearborn was on board merely as a passenger , on his way to Niagara . The death of General Pike may have diminished the amount of success that crowned the day . He was brave and enterprising , and eager for distinction , having the unbounded confidence of his command . The l ) ursuit , had he survived the explosion , would probably have been made with more spirit , but no better success , as he , no doubt , would also have listened to the overtures for a surrender , and , like his successor , have been beguiled out of valuable time . Had either of them , however , taken the unusual step of promptly rejecting them , and passed on to capture and destroy , ( as many , under the exasperation naturally excited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , felt inclined to do , ) it is not at all probable that General Sheaffe , or his party , would have been overtaken , furnished , as no doubt they were , with all the facilities of a rapid movement which the place afforded , and which would have been wholly wanting to the pursuers . All was probably acquired , which any circumstances would have permitted . The vessel , which could not have been launched , would of course have been burnt by us , had it not been set on fire by the enemy . According to the plan of the campaign , no further delay was made at York than was necessary to withdraw such public stores found there as could be moved . // 225 A prompt re*mbarkation then took place , and the fleet sailed for the neighbourhood of Niagara . The " Notices " animadvert somewhat lightly on the delay that postponed the next step , which should have been taken with all possible rapidity , consistent with due preparation . Such preparation was certainly not complete when the brigade came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or constructed , as the proposed transit was to be made in such craft . But this was done before many days had elapsed , when a bombardment of Fort George from Fort Niagara , serving the double purpose of injuring the enemy 's works and of covering the descent of many boats which were up the river Niagara , seemed to finish all preliminaries . But the fleet , after landing the York brigade , had sailed for Sackett 's Harbour , and its return was regarded as indispensable to the coming attack . Commodore Chauncey most naturally feared for the safety of the vessels he had on the stocks at Sackett 's Harbour , and hurried back for their protection . When he sailed thence again , had he left all the troops there which he found there , that protection would not have been diminished by his visit hut , bringing away Colonel Macomb 's regiment as he did , ( of course , it is presumed , at the request of General Dearborn , ) he left his ship-yard and naval stores much more weakly guarded than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at anchor off Niagara , instead of going to Sackett 's Harbour , the crossing at Fort George would no doubt have been made a week or two sooner , and the latter place would have been much less perilled , than it actually was , in the attack by Sir George Prevost , which followed soon after his departure . We may remark further on this exposure of Sackett 's Harbour , that , had the enterprise of Sir George heen as successful as it might have been and should have been ( for the defence of the place had been almost given up when the enemy desisted ) , General Dearborn would have stood convicted before the public of exposing himself to a blow behind , while looking only to his front . Indeed , he escaped the mortification of such a conviction only by an accident . It was probably deemed important that the fleet should accompany the troops at their crossing . Its presence was certainly an imposing accompaniment , and two of its snall vessels rendered most beneficial service at the landing . They took their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vOL . LIII. - NO. 112. // and soon silenced a one-gun battery there ; thus freeing them from an annoyance which might have dealt much destruction among the crowded boats. * These two vessels were therefore almost essential to the expedition . More than they might have been dispensed with , excepting for the purpose of holding the reserve , - Colonel Macomb 's regiment , - more at hand , as well as giving the Commander-in-chief a distant view of the landing . Whether such a detachnent from the fleet might not have been left behind , and thus avoided considerable delay , is a question that has often been asked . Fort George was finally taken on the 27th of May , about a month after the capture of York . The plan of the campaign intended that but a few days should have intervened . The " Notices , " in remarking upon this attack , point out several errors in the arrangement of the troops . It is not the first time that leaving open the Queenstown road has been instanced as one . Attention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have made it the main point of crossing , was forbidden by many considerations . In the first place , the boats , necessary to the transit , could not have been properly concealed or protected on the river within convenient distance . In the next place , to have shut up that avenue for his retreat , would have still left open to the enemy the road by the lake and shore , by far the most desirable for a rapid junction with the country below . There was not force enough to admit of closing up effectually both these avenues . And a division , under such circumstances , would have been against all rules of warfare and prudence . Operating upon the lake-shore presented many advantages . The boats were all at hand , ready to receive the troops , without any molestation , the point of departure being some three or four miles east of the mouth of the Niagara river . Landing , moreover , on the lake-shore of the enemy , closed up the avenue of retreat along the lake , and threw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qucenstown route , which retarded his retreat towards the head of the lake a day or more , - an important gain of time to us , had we wisely improved it . * As the troops were approaching the shore during this operation oC the two vessels , a small boat was seen passing to and fro between them , in much contempt of the shots that this one gun threw into the lake until it was silenced . This little wherry had Lieutenant Perry on hoard , who then gave an earnest of the daring which , before the season closed , lighted up another lake with a blaze of glory . // The capture of the garrison , therefore , was out of the question , unless the British had come to the improbable determination of maintaining the fort . The pursuit was not taken up with the spirit , after the enemy fell hack from the lakeshore , which might have been expected . His cannon opened from the village of Newark as if he had determined to make defence there . It appeared afterwards that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort above . As soon as it was silenced or withdrawn , the pursuit was directed by the senior general on the ground . The remark of the " Notices , " that it was made without orders , may apply to the advance , but not to the brigades which followed . Thus far , then , the plan of the campaign would seem to have been followed up with spirit , as well as with satisfactory success . Here , however , that spirit , and , of course , that success , ended . From the first day of the occupation of British ground a series of movements began , which showed little regard for that plan , and still less for the rules of warfare . When the pursuit of the enemy , after the evacuation of Fort George , was resolved upon , there was clearly but one course which held out encouragement of success . Any pursuit that proposed , like that taken up on the day of the evacuation , merely a rear-chase , was not of this character . The enemy fled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relative strength remained the same , with the advantage of many hours ' start , and of all such facilities as bridges , unobstructed road 's , &amp;c. , which he would take good care should not remain in his rear for the benefit of his pursuers . Had there been no alternative , however , even such a hopeless chase might have been undertaken as a pis aller . But the choice was without any such restrictions . The retreat having been made on the Queenstown route , the lake road was open , which intersected the other route at about twelve miles ' distance , giving our troops the advantage of some eight or ten miles . Under such circumstances there was no time to be lost . A waste of even a few hours might be fatal . It is true , the troops were fatigued with the labors and exhaustion of the day . Those actually engaged had had no relaxation from the dawn to the time when the evacuation took place , about noon . But there was the reserve , - a strong regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the second brigade not much diminished in vigor , as the contest at the landing had been maintained // by the advance and first brigade ; the enemy retreating from the shore as the others were successively hurrying towards it . Out of these a corps could have been formed , which might safely have placed itself at the intersection referred to , with every chance of another favorable conflict with the enemy , who would there have found himself deprived of most of the facilities of a retreat . We need scarcely add that no such pursuit as is here spoken of was undertaken in time . The next day was too late , and every subsequent movement was a new step of divergence from the plan of the campaign , taken with little promise of any compensatory benefit . The moment that it was ascertained that the enemy could not be intercepted in his retreat around the lake , then the plan of the campaign should have been returned to with promptitude and spirit . This plan called for an immediate demolition of Fort George , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the lake with all the troops , save a strong garrison for that fort , and a corps of observation at Lewistown , to be augmented by militia , in case the enemy reoccupied Fort Erie and the strait below . The fleet was there , boats were there , and the season most propitious . Kingston was the next object . Sir James Yeo was out , but had declined an encounter with Commodore Chauncey , who could have conducted our flotilla down the shore , still in readiness to renew the challenge he had so gallantly given to his antagonist . The flotilla , in case of its acceptance , could easily have found refuge along that shore . Whether Kingston could have been taken or not , is not the question . Many things might have frustrated the best concerted plan . But nothing called for further attention up the lake , - not regarding a wild goose-chase after General Vincent as a proper object . All worthy objects were below , and thither all concentration should have been made . Had the army , collected at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kingston , Sir James must have fought , or yielded the prize . In case of his discomfiture , all on Lake Ontario fell , as a matter of course . The reverse might only have changed the objects of the campaign . Independent of the fleet , the army could have operated on Montreal ; the ultimate and main object of the campaign . It is easy to detect faults after time and events have made them manifest . There was much to lead astray at the surren // der of Fort George . Each day offered something new to justify , it was thought , a departure from the plan that was followed at York . - We have made the foregoing remarks upon what we now believe to have been mistaken steps , with no wish to question the zeal , or even the generalship , of the veteran officer who then directed , mostly from a sick-hed , or an invalid 's chair , the operations in that quarter . Withdrawing him from the command , just at the moment when reviving health was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief in command who knew the general plan of operations , paralyzed the rest of the campaign , which lingered on in idleness , until autumnal storms defeated all attempts to recover lost ground . The " Notices " give a fair summary of the events of this autumnal campaign , which the angry elements , hut more the angry bickerings of generals , brought to a close , that disappointed , disheartened , not to say disgusted the public . The presence of the " War Department " itself , which , as we before remarked , was at this time hovering on the frontiers , like the hub of a wheel crowded towards the periphery , could not harmonize discordant minds , which seemed to regard public interests as subordinate to private animosities . Circumstances may not have presented much choice , though there was the veteran of whom we have just spoken , who might have been replaced , at any time during the season , with probable advantage , at his post , - and it may have been hoped that feuds , which had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature of the North . But it was found , unfortunately for the country , that the generals changed cwlurn , non animum , when they exchanged Louisiana for the Canada frontier . We gladly turn back from these scenes , where gallantry in several conflicts , and patient endurance of much suffering , were unavailing both to the army and the country , to the events in the far west , where , earlier in the season , both the water and the land had been illumined with an unexpected brilliancy of success . Perry 's victory had been complete , and annihilated his antagonist . Not a vestige of opposition floated on Lake Erie , and General Harrison crossed over his army to the vicinity of MaIden , with no more fear of molestation than if it had been a season of profound peace . The pursuit which trod on the heels of General Proctor // was a legitimate operation of war . No other object solicited or claimed attention in that quarter , excepting the retreating British . This pursuit might fail of overtaking the enemy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were captured or not , was a positive loss on one side , and a beneficial gain to the other . In occupying Michigan , it was all important to find the Indians convinced that their ally was fast receding from them . Under these circumstances , the pursuit , divested of all incumbrances , was made hot with vigor and haste , being joined opposite Detroit by Colonel Johnson 's mounted rangers , which enabled General Harrison to continue it with some hope of success . Before this junction , he was without any hope. * The victory at the Moravian towns was a counterpart of Perry 's victory . It swept the land of all opposition in that quarter . Much controversy has agitated portions of the public relative to this action . The names of illustrious individuals have been alternately thrown in , like the sword of Brennus , to incline the scale . Posterity will inquire little into these minor disputes , arising from feelings with which the public at large has no sympathy . The names of Perry and Harrison are indissolubly connected with kindred victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be vain . The " Notices " do not pretend to embrace a view of the achievements of our Navy , or its operations , except so far as they were connected with the operations on land . This is truly giving " only half the battle . " I3ut , as a military man , the author intended to keep within the bounds of professional familiarity , knowing that he was at home on land , while he might not have proved so on the deep . There were operations upon the coast , however , which , having been the result of certain acts of the army on the northern frontier , most properly engaged his attention . One of the acts alluded to , is the burning of Newark , in 1813 , by Brigadier-General McClure , of the New York Militia . This destruction of a small vil * We should regret to suppose that the author of the " Notices " intended that his account of this pursuit should leave an impression on the reader 's mind , that General Harrison 's " desponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being undertaken . We are sure that the extract from his letter to the Secretary of War , showing his determination to undertake it , even when hoping against hope , quoted by the " Notices , " should have shielded him from even a shadow of suspicion of this kind . // lage , without justifiable cause , gave portions of the subsequent war a new and revolting character . Strictly military objects were no longer regarded as alone within its scope . Private property , and defenceless communities , suffered , as in the days of brigandism . Buffalo had been burnt by the British early in the contest . But General McClure did not shelter his act under the plea of retaliation . It was " merely to deprive the enemy of winter quarters " that he laid Newark in ashes , and gave the eneii ) y a pretext for resorting to that obdurate and extreme plea , and balancing the account with retribution seven-fold , if not seventy times seven . During the occupation of Fort George the preceding season , Newark had been nearly abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left dwellings &amp;c. untouched , unavoidably interrupted all business and ordinary avocations , and trenched much upon the comforts of families . The severe requisitions of war had called into the field most of the men of the place , who , when it was evacuated in May , were borne off by the retreating force . The families mostly , sooner or later , followed , and remained away during the campaign . These circumstances , while they did not furnish any justification for the act of General McClure , much diminished the amount of misery that such an act generally brings on a community . Indeed , it is probable that , when he applied the torch to Newark , few of the former occupants of the houses had returned , and that the flames preyed for the most part upon a deserted village . Far otherwise was it with the villages and towns on which the British Admiral avenged its wrongs . It found them all full of families , anticipating no invasion of their comforts , and left them plundered , often in ashes , and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisting , victims . These events are justly held up for the reprobation of posterity , and names , however high , should not be suffered to shake off the infamy that belongs to them . General McClure undoubtedly acted under a mistaken sense of duty , or an ignorance of the cusloins of war . But mistakes , that involve such serious consequences to whole communities , are to be held up as the solemn warnings of history . The British Admiral began his career of depredation and conflagration with the sword of justice in his hand . But it soon became merely the sword of vengeance . Justice was // July , amply satisfied before he sacked even one of the many towns that fell beneath his fury . If he acted under instructions , which required him to exact this enormous retribution , he stands , like the executioner , apart from mankind , with the taint of blood upon him . The author of the " Notices , ** with his strong and indignant language , stamps these deeds and these characters with ineffaceable reprobation . War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous chivalry , can wholly , or even in any important degree , abate ; but he who , either through rash ignorance , or as the willing instrument of exasperated power , aggravates them , must expect the severest condemnation of history . The campaign of 1814 on the Niagara frontier is described in much detail in the " Notices . " The author 's feelings are awakened to new enthusiasm while recording a series of actions which conferred such renown on the American arms . This campaign , as a plan , would seem to be very subordinate in character , in compass of objects , chances of success in attaining them , and beneficial results even when attained , compared with that of 1813 . " To cross the river Niagara at Black Rock , capture Fort Erie , march on Chippewa , risk a combat , menace Fort George , and , if assured of ascendency and cooperation of the fleet , to seize and fortify Burlington , " &amp;c. , * appear to have been these objects . There is much off-hand sententiousness in the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as said . The first and second parts of the plan were promptly and gallantly fulfilled . Whether the enemy anticipated such an irruption , or not , may not be known , but it would seem that he had very inadequate means of opposition , and that those means were not used with much vigilance or dexterity . The remaining parts depended more upon contingencies , and might , or might not , be fulfilled , as those contingencies were lucky or otherwise . The moment our army crossed the Niagara , a combat was undoubtedly risked . Any expectation of avoiding such a " risk , " after having placed a wide and rapid river between it and its base of operations , must have been wholly unfounded . This portion of the direction , therefore , was mere surplusage , the redundancy of a current calamo style . To menace Fort George " was probably more easy than useful . // The object of it does not appear , as having been necessary to secure the ultimate and main object , that is , the possession of Burlington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted that object , and might , perhaps , as well have been directed , all directions of such kind including the reservation , " provided it be practicable . " The possession of Burlington Heights would have cut off the retreat by land of the garrison at Fort George , ( an advantage , in case that place were merely menaced , ) besides giving the troops there such an advance on their way around Lake Ontario , if such a circuit were contemplated . Further benefits than these are not obvious in connexion with this main object of the campaign . Moreover , hinging the whole movement on the " ascendency and cooperation " of the fleet , when both were too problematical to be relied upon , was something like a foregone conclusion against all hope of success . Sir James Yeo had thus far showed equal skill and discretion in his tactics , knowing that to avoid being beat by his antagonist was something like a victory . Commodore Chauncey had chased him throughout the previous season from pillar to post , and had become satisfied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . He began the new season under the same auspices . His great and main object was to pursue Sir James when his strength permitted it , and watch for that tide in his affairs which was to lead on to better fortune . His next object was to keep tip the energy of his shipyard . It was a game of launch , and he who built the most in the shortest time expected to win the stakes . The temporary ascendancy he might have at intervals could be of little or no benefit to the army , as it was not founded on the defeat , or even crippled state , of Sir James , who , while avoiding all encounters , was still able to interfere more or less with any *o6perative measures . It was undoubtedly desirable that the fleet should lend assistance to the army , such assistance as , in 1813 , had often proved highly advantageous ; but the position of Commodore Chauncey necessarily made that assistance a subordinate consideration . He had a higher object , though not a " higher destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our present lights , that the fleet should have been made so indispensable to the army movements . It had a wider and more appropriate field // below ; though on this subject , suggesting such a train of reflections , we do not feel warranted to enlarge . Fortunately for the country , this campaign is not judged by the merits of the original plan . Little is thought of it in that respect . Few look beyond the hard-fought fields where so much blood was spilt , so much bravery displayed , so much glory acquired . It is not asked how the army got there , or whether suitable or attainable objects were in view . We see only the brilliant contest beneath the full blaze of a July sun at Chippewa , when every combatant could almost look into the countenance of his opponent , and the loss and gain were easily counted up , until the balance stood in fearful odds against the enemy ; or the far more bloody , much longer doubtful , fight near the Falls , which wearied out the declining day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled the hour of midnight with its unintermnitting din ; or the siege of Fort Erie , where perseverance , endurance , and courage repulsed assaults with the steadiness of a solid wall or the sortie , where skill , gallantry , energy , and combination , rose like a Phmnix from the ashes of the siege , and overwhelmed the enemy with a surprise as unexpected as triumphant . The public does not see , through this glare of honorable achievement , the " spots " that the critic may detect . Many versions of the details of some of these actions , particularly of that of the Falls , have solicited the attention and verdict of the public . That public is concerned only in the main and acknowledged facts , - those which make the honor of the day , and elevate the national character . Whether the author of the " Notices " has succeeded in harmonizing the numerous conflicting accounts of the action , so as to have sifted out truth from error , and settled the record for future history , may not , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his authority will be appealed to hereafter with great respect , and perhaps as decisive of disputed points . Following down the course of events , the " Notices " give dtme place to those on the northern frontier , on the sea-coast , including the irruption on Washington and Baltimore , and at New Orleans . in determining to make a decisive campaign on this side of the Atlantic in 1814 , the British , having , by the submission of France , liberated large bodies of their veteran troops from European duty , resolved to transfer a sufficient force to North America , to end the contest there // as triumphantly as they had just ended the continental war . With this view some twenty thousand men were held in readiness to embark . They should have tried the effect of striking one strong blow instead of two weak ones . The force which diverged upon Canada and New Orleans might have made a deep impression at any one intermediate point . Sir Henry Clinton and General Burgoyne might , united , have made an avenue from New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two armies which failed before Plattsburg and New Orleans , might , as one army , have succeeded , temporarily , anywhere else . Sir George Provost was always unlucky as an officer . His administration was active and vigilant , but his military attempts ended uniformly in discomfiture , or abandonment of their object . When , on Lake Champlain , he linked his fortunes on land to the fate of his fleet , he lost half the strength of his position . Regarding his water craft merely as auxiliaries , without depending upon it for success , he might have inflicted great injury upon the country he invaded , even after this craft ceased to sustain his flank . It is true , that , when Commodore M'Donough rode triumphant on Lake Champlain , his facility of obtaining supplies would have been much diminished . But the land was all open behind him , and the loss of his fleet deprived him of but a minor element in his operations for a short campaign . The retreat of his thousands before the mere hundreds of General Macomb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The irruption on Washington and Baltimore claims the especial attention of the author of the " Notices . " The enemy here trenched on the very ground occupied by the Honorable Secretary himself . The War Department itself was assailed and broken up . These circumstances furnish ample motives for making up the record with circumspection . It is well known that the Secretary of War was not the military commander in that quarter . Responsibility rested on subordinate shoulders . Still , the public believed that an officer , encamped under the very eaves of the War Department , would most naturally consult with , and even receive directions , either semi-official , or ultra-official , from the incumbent of that high station ; and , accordingly , the events of those days have always been referred , more or less , to the unavoidable influences arising from that juxtaposition . // July , Those who visited Washington in the spring of 1814 , will recollect the extreme anxiety that pervaded that community on the subject of an invasion , and the common impression that that anxiety found little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District " looked up as its quasi military chief , an officer of the army at that time not having been appointed to battle afar off . Whether any precautions thus suggested would have averted the destruction that fell upon the Capitol a few months afterwards , can not be asserted ; but timely preparation seldom diminishes the chances of safety , and prevention is proverhially better than cure . There is hut one opinion as to the operations in that quarter , which is , that they were misdirected , or that the means at hand were generally misapplied . Fort Washington , the key of the principal avenue to the federal city , was confided to hands which threw that key at the enemy 's feet , even before he demanded it . Such extreme incompetency should have been suspected . The fleet that came up the Potomac would never have attempted to pass that obstac ! e , had it stood with any show of defence . As to the main attack of the enemy , any endeavours , more than were made , to arrest the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The troops which were opposed to the enemy were mostly raw militia . These could he hoped to be used to advantare only where some natural obstacles would greatly favor any stand they might make . It was , therefore , prudent to confine all operations preliminary to such a stand at such a point , to mere partisan annoyance . This point was the East River , or the branch on which Bladensburg stands . Small bodies of troops , or corps of observation , were accordingly placed here and there on the routes leading from the Patuxet to that branch , to watch the enemy 's advance , and occasionally , when fitting opportunities presented , to offer resistance to his advance guards . There were two bridges over the stream here alluded to . It seems inexplicable that one of them was not destroyed as soon as it became suspected that Washington was the object . Even if there had been an uncertainty in this respect , and it was apprehended that a junction with the fleet near Alexandria was in view , still the lower bridge should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the capital greatly // counterbalanced the preservation of a mere facility to fall on the enemy 's rear , in case he should turn aside fron this main object . The early destruction of the lower bridge would have necessarily confined the enemy 's advance to one avenue , and all preparations to meet him would have had the same convenient limits . Leaving that bridge untouched unuil the last moment , and keeping there a large body of troops until it became certain tl ) at they were in a false position , was a capital error . These troops , including the gallant Barney 's detachment , were hurried to their true position through the heat of mid-day , reaching it in an exhausted state , just in time to swell the tide of retreat . This error was sufficient to cause the loss of the day. * It has often been said that the President and his Cabinet , who are known to have been on the skirts of the battle of Bladensburg , were in a false position ; that their presence was an embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter may be true , and yet we do not see how , when the enemy was sounding the trumpet in their ears , they could have done otherwise than lend their countenance to a battle that was to decide the fate of the Capitol , unless they were expected , like the Ronian senators at the Gaul invasion , to sit in their official chairs , until hurled out of them by the modern Gauls , or to have prudently retired even before the shadow of coming events . Mr. Monroe , the then Secretary of State , kindling up with Revolutionary fire , was actively iiiingling in all the movements preliminary to the battle of Bladensburg ,  --  not , we trust , as the " Notices " would have the reader infer , to perplex and mislead them , - and he was among the combatants at that place , vainly striving to stem the ebbing fortunes of the day . His civil station permitted him thus to mingle , without any appearance of intrusion on the province of the military commander . He was where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be found . He was in his proper place . And so was The appendix gives the diary of " Colonel Allan McClure , " who appears to have mingled officially in all these movements . He gives the advice of the Secretary of War to General Winder , soon after the British had landed , which was , in substance , either to harass the enemy as he was harassed at Lexington and Concord , in 1775 ; or , to fall slowly back , inviting the enemy onward , and occopy the Capitol , making the main defence there . Both of these suggestions appear to have been troly military and pertinent , and we can not but regret that one or both of them had not been adopted . // the President . He gave all the encouragement he properly could to the wavering troops , until he found that they left no alternative but flight or captivity . And we have as little doubt that the Secretary of War was at his proper post too , side by side , as he was , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were likely to be available . That the Capitol might have proved an impregnable citadel against the enemy , exhausted as he was , and with no heavy artillery , and evidently feeling that he had ventured too far into a hostile and populous country , now hardly admits of a doubt . The author of the " Notices " states distinctly that he was in favor of making it another " Chew 's house . " Whether any direct suggestion to that effect was made to the President , has not , we believe , been distinctly understood . It has , however , been generally supposed , that he did not approve the measure , judging , perhaps , from the events of the day , that any such stand would be unavailing , and more probably fearing that it would only authorize the enemy to destroy the building . He was fully authorized to believe that if it were not so occupied , it would be permitted to stand uninjured . The laws and customns of war protected it when thus disconnected from all purposes of hostility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranty in the character of a nation , professing to respect those laws and customs , against all Vandalism . But the President ( if he thus opposed such a suggestion ) lost both Capitol and capital , when , perhaps , he might have saved both , had he relied less on the civilized character of the British nation , which vainly boasts of having occupied , in the same quarter of a century , capital after capital in Europe , without having left any such infamous memorial behind . The pred:mtory occupation of Alexandria was in conformity with the burning of the Capitol and the President 's house . Undefended and defenceless private property was made to ransom itself as if from piratical rapacity . The rule of war in these cases is as plain and acknowledged as any international obligation whatever . Private property at sea becomes subject to the clutches of war , but private property on land is not so . And public buildings , used for civil purposes alone , are also respected . The British had a right to raze all forts , arsenals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground ; but the Capitol , the President 's house , // 239 and the flour and tobacco of Alexandria , were as much exempt from destruction or depredation , as would be the Parliament house , St. James 's palace , or the silver 5*OOfl5 of any family , if , by any freak of fortune , the United States were to occupy London in a hostile way . Perhaps it may be thought that remarks of this kind , which are likely to revive slumbering passions , or exasperate those still awake , notwithstanding the lapse of more than a quarter of a century , were better omitted than made . But we should contemplate history to little advantage , if we dwelt only on its agreeable aspect . The example of such nieri as iMcClure , Ross , and Cockburn , should he held up conspicuously , as a warning both to nations and individuals . General Ross at the battle of Bladensburg , where his gallantry and soldiership honorably won the day , is as much respected by Americans as by Britons ; but the moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he enrolled himself in that class of historical personages , at the head of which stands the lEphesian incendiary . The closing scene of the war of 1812 , namely , the defence of New Orleans , occupies its proper l ) lace in the " Notices . " High credit is given for the boldness , resource , and constancy with which that defence was made , while the military errors committed on both sides are examined with acumen and fairness . These volumes will hereafter be consulted by the soldier , who is gathering up lessons in the art of war . The critical remarks of the distinguished author will throw much light on this subject . We have no space to follow him through his account of the memorable " 8th of January . " It has a celebrity that will always endure , and which will carry down to the latest posterity the great name indissolubly connected with it . This nation is often in circumstances wl ) ich must lead her to regard war as an event which may visit her again and again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past with a view to benefit for the future . The war of 1812 should be the subject of reflection in the mind of every statesman , who may have the responsibility of meeting a like emergency . If this war deserve to be a guide in the managetnent it exhibited , its details can not be too much studied . On the contrary , if that management were faulty , still the instruction is the same . There is now probably little doubt // in the mind of any person who has examined the subject , that the initial operations of the war , so far as they related to the land , were nearly or quite all wrong ; and were likely to lead , as they mostly did lead , only to disaster and disgrace . We were not prepared for offensive operations on the frontiers , and therefore should not have undertaken them until suitable preparations were made . Nothing would have been lost by the delay . The frontiers could have been protected , and the troops improved by discipline . The conquest of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had been attainable . No desire had been evinced by the Provinces to join us , and we , as a nation , had no desire to receive them ; 1775 and 76 were not forgotten . Impressions made here and there , according to the plan of the campaigns of 1812 , could have produced no beneficial results , even if they bad proved successful . They were l*.ke attempts to hreach a wall by random shots , no two of which strike in the same place . The defence of the Northwestern frontier against Indian aggressions , much to be apprehended in that quarter , was a paramount obligation . General Hull 's movement , therefore , so far as it related to Michigan . was expedient and necessary , and might have completely fulfilled its object , had it been preceded by common forecast , and executed with common prudence . Two things , which did not depend on him , were omitted , - omissions that almost necessarily sent misfortune before him , and brought up his rear with defeat . We have already sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given to these instructive warnings . Whether these volumes , which are full of such warnings , will have the beneficial influence they deserve , is a matter of painful doubt . We have instances every few years of a willingness on the part of those who are in the councils of the nation to rush blindly into war , with scarcely a question as to our preparation for such an event . This want of forecast may be excusable in Congress , a body of many minds , among which concurrence of opinion , especially in prudential matters , is not to be anticipated . But the Executive has power to act , so far as its province extends , either with caution or with energy , as the emergency may demand . The means placed at its disposal may be limited , but they can be well applied . There is no teaching for Congress . // A change comes over it too often for the influence of experience . But those who administer the government should consult history , and benefit by its admonitions . In these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostilities are almost inevitable , they may ponder on these volumes with great advantage . The appendix to this work has much valuable matter , and much that is a mere incumbrance to the volumes . Facts which are not suited to the text from their diffuseness or technical dryness , very properly fall . into an appendix , provided they are essential or desirable illustrations of it . Such , however , as have only a temporary interest , or are ex parte in their character , tending rather to mislead than to rectify the judgment , do not deserve such an honorable place . There are long documents of the latter character introduced into this appendix , which had better have been left to that oblivion from which this republication has probably rescued them . The helter-skelter affair of Qucenstown occupies its full quota of pages in the body of the work , and there is no warrant , either in fairness or expediency , in permitting a single witness , - a most worthy officer , it is true , - to occupy the stand such an inordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who might as justly claim the same privilege . Still less can we see any sufficient excuse in a mere willingness to befriend the memory of a deceased officer , for allowing the Beaver dam mishap , - according to its magnitude , by far the most discreditable event of the war , and very properly dismissed with a few paragraphs in the text , - to dilate in the Appendix beyond almost any other action in the work . We can not part with the " Notices " without finding some fault with the exterior . No matter what time may elapse between the publication of two volumes of the same work , they should be so germane to each other as at least to be recognised as of the same family . The last volume is undoubtedly an improvement on the first , which is almost shamed out of countenance by the better dress and fairer countenance of its younger sister . We do not find fault with the change that has taken place in the title-page , giving the author , in the last volume , the full benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while , in the first , his name stood divested of all blazonry of this kind . The // work should have the full benefit of all adventitious circumstances of this sort , and it is a pity that it did not begin , in this respect , as it has left off . It was at once obvious , however , to military men , that there was an error in the rank assumed ; and , while the list of " Errata " undertakes to correct it , the true grade should have been given , instead of one which has never but once been known in our service . Certainly the fact that the author had been promoted , as it were , from the grade of Brigadier-General to the War Department , was too creditable to be shaded off in the slightest degree . It is also to be hoped that in any new edition , the distinguished author will expunge all instances of irony , and affectations of contempt , which too often disfigure his highly wrought pages . The terms KMir . Wilkinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express the meaning to be conveyed , unless more is meant than meets the eye . Since the days of Smollet , who speaks of " Mr. Wolfe " and the like , from an English habit which no American author will acknowledge , military men are ever designated by the titles that bespeak their rank . Omitting such , not merely courtesy , but necessary illustration of rank and position , either through an affected lapse of the pen , or from disrespectful or contemptuous feelings , is beneath the dignity of history , and also of the historian.
