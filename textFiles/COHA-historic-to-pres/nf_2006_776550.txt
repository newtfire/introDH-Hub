On the Seventh Day , God Rested and Liberals Schemed // Liberals love to boast that they are not " religious , " which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion . Of course liberalism is a religion . It has its own cosmology , its own miracles , its own beliefs in the supernatural , its own churches , its own high priests , its own saints , its own total worldview , and its own explanation of the existence of the universe . In other words , liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as " religion . " // Under the guise of not favoring religion , liberals favor one cosmology over another and demand total indoctrination into theirs . The state religion of liberalism demands obeisance ( to the National Organization for Women ) , tithing ( to teachers ? unions ) , reverence ( for abortion ) , and formulaic imprecations ( " Bush lied , kids died ! " " Keep your laws off my body ! " " Arms for hostages ! " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion through the public schools , where innocent children are taught a specific belief system , rather than , say , math . // Liberal doctrines are less scientifically provable than the story of Noah ? s ark , but their belief system is taught as fact in government schools , while the Biblical belief system is banned from government schools by law . As a matter of faith , liberals believe : Darwinism is a fact , people are born gay , child-molesters can be rehabilitated , recycling is a virtue , and chastity is not . If people are born gay , why hasn ? t Darwinism weeded out people who don ? t reproduce ? ( For that , we need a theory of survival of the most fabulous . ) And if gays can ? t change , why do liberals think child-molesters can ? Pedophilia is a sexual preference . If they ? re born that way , instead of rehabilitation , how about keeping them locked up ? Why must children be taught that recycling is the only answer ? Why aren ? t we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? t allowed to ask . Believers in the liberal faith might turn violent  --  much like the practitioners of Islam , the Religion of Peace , who ransacked Danish embassies worldwide because a Danish newspaper published cartoons of Mohammed . This is something else that can ? t be taught in government schools : Muslims ? predilection for violence . On the first anniversary of the 9/11 attack , the National Education Association ? s instruction materials exhorted teachers , " Do not suggest that any group is responsible " for the attack of 9/11. // If a Martian landed in America and set out to determine the nation ? s official state religion , he would have to conclude it is liberalism , while Christianity and Judaism are prohibited by law . And not just in Cambridge , Massachusetts , where it ? s actually on the books , but throughout the land . This is a country in which taxpayers are forced to subsidize " artistic " exhibits of aborted fetuses , crucifixes in urine , and gay pornography . Meanwhile , it ? s unconstitutional to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government property if the purpose is to promote monotheistic religion . // Nearly half the members of the Supreme Court  --  the ones generally known as " liberals "  --  are itching to ban the references to God on our coins and in the Pledge of Allegiance . They resisted in 2004 on procedural grounds only because it was an election year . The absence of a divinity makes liberals ? belief system no less religious . Liberals define religion as only those belief systems that subscribe to the notion of a divine being in order to dismiss other religions as mere religion and theirs as something greater . Shintoism and Buddhism have no Creator God either , and they are considered religions . Curiously , those are two of the most popular religions among leftists  --  at least until 9/11 , when Islam became all the rage . // Liberalism is a comprehensive belief system denying the Christian belief in man ? s immortal soul . Their religion holds that there is nothing sacred about human consciousness . It ? s just an accident no more significant than our possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves : that we are moral beings in God ? s image . Without this fundamental understanding of man ? s place in the world , we risk being lured into misguided pursuits , including bestiality , slavery , and PETA membership . Liberals swoon in pagan admiration of Mother Earth , mystified and overawed by her power . They deny the Biblical idea of dominion and progress , the most ringing affirmation of which is the United States of America . Although they are Druids , liberals masquerade as rationalists , adopting a sneering tone of scientific sophistication , which is a little like being condescended to by a tarot card reader . // Liberals hate science and react badly to it . They will literally run from the room , lightheaded and nauseated , when told of data that might suggest that the sexes have different abilities in math and science . They repudiate science when it contradicts their pagan beliefs  --  that the AIDS virus doesn ? t discriminate , that there is no such thing as IQ , that nuclear power is dangerous and scary , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science exactly as they use the word constitutional . // Both words are nothing more or less than a general statement of liberal approval , having nothing to do with either science or the Constitution . ( Thus , for example , the following sentence makes sense to liberals : President Clinton saved the Constitution by repeatedly ejaculating on a fat Jewish girl in the Oval Office . ) The core of the Judeo-Christian tradition says that we are utterly and distinctly apart from other species . We have dominion over the plants and the animals on Earth . God gave it to us , it ? s ours  --  as stated succinctly in the book of Genesis . Liberals would sooner trust the stewardship of the Earth to Shetland ponies and dung beetles . All their pseudoscience supports an alternative religion that says we are an insignificant part of nature . // Environmentalists want mass infanticide , zero population growth , reduced standards of living , and vegetarianism . The core of environmentalism is that they hate mankind . Everything liberals believe is in elegant opposition to basic Biblical precepts. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spark of divinity in the human soul ; their religion holds that human progress is achieved through sex and death . // - We believe in invention and creation ; they catalogue with stupefaction the current state of our diminishing resources and tell us to stop consuming . // - We say humans stand apart from the world and our charge is Planet Earth ; they say we are part of the world , and our hubristic use of nature is sinful. // - We say humans are in God ? s image ; they say we are no different morally from the apes. // - We believe in populating the Earth until there ? s standing room only and then colonizing Mars ; they believe humans are in the twilight of their existence . // Our book is Genesis . Their book is Rachel Carson ? s Silent Spring , the original environmental hoax . Carson brainwashed an entire generation into imagining a world without birds , killed by DDT . Because of liberals ? druidical religious beliefs , they won ? t allow us to save Africans dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds . A few years after oil drilling began in Prudhoe Bay , Alaska , a saboteur set off an explosion blowing a hole in the pipeline and releasing an estimated 550,000 gallons of oil . It was one of the most devastating environmental disasters in recent history . Six weeks later , all the birds were back . Birds are like rats  --  you couldn ? t get rid of them if you tried . // The various weeds and vermin liberals are always trying to save are no more distinguishable than individual styles of rap music . The massive Dickey-Lincoln Dam , a $227 million hydroelectric project proposed on upper St. John River in Maine , was halted by the discovery of the Furbish lousewort , a plant previously believed to be extinct . Liberals didn ? t even know this plant still existed , but suddenly they were seized with affection for it . They had been missing it all that time ! ( Granted , the rediscovery of the Furbish lousewort has improved the lives of every man , woman , and child in America in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . ) Liberals are more upset when a tree is chopped down than when a child is aborted . Even if one rates an unborn child less than a full-blown person , doesn ? t the unborn child rate slightly higher than vegetation ? Liberals are constantly warning us that man is overloading the environment to the detriment of the plants . Howard Dean left the Episcopal Church  --  which is barely even a church  --  because his church , in Montpelier , Vermont , would not cede land for a bike path . Environmentally friendly exercise was more important than tending to the human soul . // That ? s all you need to know about the Democrats . // Blessed be the peacemakers who create a diverse , nonsexist working environment in paperless offices . Suspiciously , the Democrats ? idea of an energy policy never involves the creation of new energy . They want solar power , wind power , barley power . How about creating a new source of energy ? Nuclear reactors do that with no risk of funding Arab terrorists or  --  more repellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spasm of left-wing insanity in the seventies , nuclear power was curtailed in this country . // Japan has nuclear power , France has nuclear power  --  almost all modern countries have nuclear power . But we had Jane Fonda in the movie The China Syndrome . Liberals are very picky about their admiration for Western Europe . // Now it turns out even Chernobyl wasn ? t as bad as people thought . In a feat of Soviet engineering , the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploded in 1986 , sending chunks of the reactor core flying into nearby farms and igniting a fire at the reactor that burned for ten days . It was the worst nuclear disaster in history  --  finally giving us a nuclear power plant that killed more people than died in Teddy Kennedy ? s car . But as the New York Times reported in September 2005 , " Nearly 20 years after the huge accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine , a new scientific report has found that its aftereffects on health and the environment have not proved as dire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of cancer deaths from acute radiation exposure , there were 4,000 . Only 50 deaths were directly attributable to the explosion . There has been no increase in leukemia , birth defects , or fertility problems in the surrounding area . // And , I mention again , this was in the Soviet Union . Soviet engineers couldn ? t make Jell-O . They ? d show up at the World ? s Fair and stare at a flush toilet like it was a rocket ship . They turned half of Germany into an inefficient manufacturing center . Do you know how hard that is ? It ? s like botching a train wreck . Of course the Soviets screwed up nuclear power ! Instead of taking the environmentalist hamstrings off the muscular American economy  --  so we can split atoms , drill , mine , and strip  --  the Democrats want to preside over our state-managed descent into hell . // Liberals want us to live like Swedes , with their genial , mediocre lives , ratcheting back our expectations , practicing fuel austerity , and sitting by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one posits that we have a fixed amount of energy and have to start rationing it , then we are dying as a species . The theory of vegetarianism is that Americans consume " too much " energy . It takes a lot of energy to grow corn to feed animals to feed us  --  so why don ? t we become a bunch of grazing farmyard animals ourselves ? We can eat grass and share our energy with the birds ! // Environmentalists ? energy plan is the repudiation of America and Christian destiny , which is Jet Skis , steak on the electric grill , hot showers , and night skiing . Perennially irritating to environmentalists is mankind ? s single greatest invention : the flush toilet . You knew it had to happen . Apostles of " dry toilets " insist that we " have to get beyond flush-and forget technology , " as it was put by Sim Van der Ryn , founder of the Ecological Design Institute . Flush-and-forget abortions are one thing , but this is solid human waste we ? re talking about ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our excrement . Van der Ryn explained that the goal was " to deal with one ? s own waste as close to the source as possible "  --  precisely the opposite of what humans have wanted to do with their excrement since the beginning of time . // Nonflush toilets were first introduced in America  --  well , originally by the Indians  --  but then again in the sixties by a Rockefeller scion who promoted a " dry toilet " called the Clivus Multrum . They pop up again every few years but , oddly enough , never seem to catch on . Dry toilets are like the metric system of human waste disposal . // In 1995 , the New York Times was enthusiastically reporting on the move away from mankind ? s greatest invention by homeowners " fed up with overdevelopment , contaminated ground water , and overflowing septic tanks "  --  but evidently not fed up with living on top of their own excrement . These homeowners were creating environmentally friendly ways to keep their excrement close to them . They created miniature wetlands in their backyards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have advocates of nonflush toilets begun to recognize their product ? s central shortcoming , which is the natural human aversion to the " routine emptying of excrement from the toilets . " // Instead of the organic method of living in your own excrement , most people prefer the inorganic method of flushing it away from themselves . Consequently , the federal government has done the next best thing for the official state religion , which is to make it a felony to replace a 1.3-gallon toilet bowl with an old-fashioned 7-gallon toilet bowl  --  or as we call it , " a working toilet . " // The whole purpose of living in your own excrement is to save . . . water . Water . Liberals are worried we ? re going to run out of something that literally falls from the sky . Here ? s an idea : Just wait . It will rain . Every possible personal use of water combined  --  steam baths , swimming pools , showers , toilets , and kitchen sinks  --  amounts to less than 10 percent of all water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water usage and industrial use more than 20 percent . //
