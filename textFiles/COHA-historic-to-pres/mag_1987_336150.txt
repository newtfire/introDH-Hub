A sleek limousine glides through empty nighttime streets , circling the illuminated monuments of Washington . In the back seat , a clean-cut naval officer and a dark-haired beauty stare at each other a moment . Then they kiss , furiously . She flings herself on him . He gropes for the zipper of her strapless black-and-gold sheath . There is a flash of a man 's hand on a creamy thigh , the pull of a black garter . Afterward , the officer and his friend relax into opposite corners of the limo and survey the damage . " My name is Tom , " he says with a smile to end all smiles . <P> His real name is Kevin Costner , and this backseat sizzler with Sean Young from the hit political thriller No Way Out has people lining up at movie theaters across the country . With a startlingly different look as the intrepid crime crusader Eliot Ness , Costner is also drawing crowds to The Untouchables. &lt; These bookend summer successes have cinched his status as Hollywood 's new romantic leading man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength , Costner , 32 , is an old-fashioned movie hero . Like such stars as Gary Cooper , Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart , he can fill the screen with what Director Billy Wilder has called " flesh impact . " <P> Costner is a little bewildered by his romantic image . " I do n't think of myself as classically handsome , " he says . " How sexy can you be ? I do n't have enough buttons to get everybody aroused . The limo scene in No Way Out was very difficult for me . I felt there was a certain clumsiness to it . I wondered if I was doing things right . " Maybe the clumsy feeling came from his own past . As a sophomore in high school he was only 5 ft. 2 in. tall . " I did n't get my growth until college , " he says . " I 'm 6 ft. 1 in. now , but I never got over being short . I never even dated . " <P> He almost never acted either . Costner was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father , part Cherokee Indian , serviced electrical lines for Southern California Edison . His mother worked for the state welfare department . When Kevin was six , his father was promoted and began moving the family around California . " I was always on the outside , " he says . " I did n't feel ' there ' until the end of the year , and then we 'd move again . " He found a niche in high school basketball and baseball . " I had the exhibitionism knocked out of me , though , " he says . " During one basketball game I was knocked into the lap of a real pretty girl . She was drinking a Coke , and I took a sip . There was a rousing cheer . Later my dad told me , ' You 're out there to play . ' " <P> The pragmatist in Costner beat out the performer , and he enrolled at Cal State-Fullerton to study marketing and finance . By his senior year he was bored . " I picked up a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumpelstiltskin auditions , " he recalls . " I did n't get a part , but my creative spirit was pounding . " <P> After graduating , Costner married his college sweetheart , Cindy Silva , a former Snow White at Disneyland and the only woman he had ever really dated . He also took a marketing job in Orange County . " It was a disgusting thing , " he says . " I quit after 30 days . Cindy said to me , ' What are you going to do now ? ' ' Act ! ' I said . ' What else ? ' she asked . ' I 'm working on a screenplay . I 'm a writer , ' I said . ' A writer ! ' she screamed . ' You ca n't even spell ! ' She cleared the table , and papers flew up in the air like in a cartoon . "
