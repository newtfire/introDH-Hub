To-morrow morning . lie says . he will surrender himself to the Sheriff of Passaic County in order to serve his sentence from which he has taken an appeal in vain . As he passed down the gangplank smoking his black German pipe he was apparently as unconcerned about his returning% to America as if he were bent on small business .

If the man accused of inciting riot was I. boring under any mental suspense as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made apparent by any word he uttered . or any expression which came over his face . Speaking with a decided English accent , with a suggestion here and there of Scotch , he said : I think the facts concerning the riots In Paterson are known fairly well , but I do n't mind running over the story in general . I was asked to visit Paterson on June 17 , 1902 , to see if I could do anything to aid the silk dyers who were at that time considering strike action . I went to Paterson , ; end on the night of the 17th I addressed a meeting of the silk dyers , and gave them such counsel as I could . 1 saw that the condition warranted the calling of a general strike , and in a speech delivered . at about nine o'clock on the morning of the 18th I called the strike and the weavers , out of sympathy , went on strike with the dyers . " I believe there was a tremendous riot that day , a number of mills being destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the amount of about . ? ; 50,01 ) ( 1 was sustained , and also several persons shot , including a reporter and a Policeman . and others . " I was out on the street during all the trouble , and I went here and there among the rioters , and pleaded with them to stop their rioting , to lay down their arms , and listen to reason . I was accused of having ? incited riot . ' arrested . and placed on trial . The verdict was guilty , and a sentence of five years imposed . I took an appeal , and lost . on bail and the opportunity afforded I visited Leeds , England . where I lived for many years , solely for the purpose of seeing that my family was provided for . At my home in Cross Mats , Dewsbury Road , Leeds , we established comfortable quarters , but last year my wife wished to visit America and remain here , as I had decided to come back and serve out my sentence . My wife and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permitted to land . Returning , I succeeded in reestablishing them comfortably in the old hams , and at the first moment I arranged to come to America , and here I am . " I think my plans from this on are quite complete . To-morrow afternoon I shall go to New Jersey , and if nothing happens I shall attend to a few little details which need my care , and then I shall present myself to the Sheriff of Passaic County on Tuesday morning at the County Jail , and surrender myself , prepared to serve my sentence or whatever part of it the law shall require . I am convinced that I have been unjustly sentenced , having committed no crime , but I have decided to conform with the law . I had hoped that a higher court would see that I had been unjustly dealt with , but this was not to be . I should have appeared in October of last year , but the details of my family needs kept me in England .
