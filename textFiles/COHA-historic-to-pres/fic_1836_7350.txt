THE PARTISAN LEADER ; A TALE OF THE FUTURE . BY EDWARD WILLIAM SIDNEY . " SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS . " The Motto of Virginia . " PARS FUI . " Virgil . IN TWO VOLUMES . VOL . I. PRINTED FOR THE PUBLISHERS , BY JAMES CAXTON . 1856 Copy-right secured according to law . DEDICATION . Letter - The part I bore in the transactions which form the subject of the following narrative , is my voucher for its authenticity . My admiration of the gallant people , whose struggle for freedom I witnessed and partook ; the cherished friendships contracted among them , at a time of life when the heart is warm , and under circumstances which called all its best feelings into action ; and , above all , the connexion then formed , which has identified me with Virginia , and which , during the last five years , has been the source of all my happiness ; are my inducements to dedicate this work to you . The approbation which , in acknowledging , more than rewarded my humble services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful veneration will be favorably received . Among those whom Virginia , at this time , honors with high places in her councils , I see , with pride , the names of many with whom I once stood , shoulder to shoulder , in the eye of danger . Of my regard for these , this is not the place to speak , for they are not thus to learn my sentiments concerning them . The record of their praise , and the reward of their glorious deeds , is on the page of history . But there are others who will die without their fame , and whose names will sink with them into the tomb , of whose unpretending devotion to their native country I am proud to testify . They belong to that class , peculiar to a society whose institutions are based on domestic slavery ; the honest , brave , hardy , and high-spirited peasantry of Virginia . Among them , I saw examples of simple virtue and instinctive patriotism ; and from their lips I heard lessons of that untaught wisdom , which finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and undebased by abject and menial occupations . The names of Jacob Schwartz and Christian Witt deserve to live in history . But the narrative , in which I have endeavored to preserve them , will , in after times , be classed among romances . Such is the fate of all men , whose deeds shame the vaunted achievements of those the world calls great . Be it so . It is not the less my duty to testify of what I have witnessed . Remembering the virtues which I saw displayed by such , I take pride in dedicating to the whole people of Virginia , in all ranks and classes , this imperfect record of what I witnessed in her late glorious struggle . E. W. S. P. S. My date reminds me that this is the anniversary of that glorious day , on which Virginia first declared herself an independent State . May its auspicious return ever find you FREE , HAPPY , and GLORIOUS ! Preliminaries Main text CHAPTER I. And whomsoe'er , along the path you meet , Bears in his cap the badge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whom to greet . Byron . Toward the latter end of the month of October , 1849 , about the hour of noon , a horseman was seen ascending a narrow valley at the eastern foot of the Blue Ridge . His road nearly followed the course of a small stream , which , issuing from a deep gorge of the mountain , winds its way between lofty hills , and terminates its brief and brawling course in one of the larger tributaries of the Dan . A glance of the eye took in the whole of the little settlement that lined its banks , and measured the resources of its inhabitants . The different tenements were so near to each other as to allow but a small patch of arable land to each . Of manufactures there was no appearance , save only a rude shed at the entrance of the valley , on the door of which the oft repeated brand of the horse-shoe gave token of a smithy . There too the rivulet , increased by the innumerable springs which afforded to every habitation the unappreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sparkling , had gathered strength enough to turn a tiny mill . Of trade there could be none . The bleak and rugged barrier , which closed the scene on the west , and the narrow road , fading to a foot-path , gave assurance to the traveller that he had here reached the ne plus ultra of social life in that direction . Indeed , the appearance of discomfort and poverty in every dwelling well accorded with the scanty territory belonging to each . The walls and chimneys of unhewn logs , the roofs of loose boards laid on long rib-poles , that projected from the gables , and held down by similar poles placed above them , together with the smoked and sooty appearance of the whole , betokened an abundance of timber , but a dearth of every thing else . Contiguous to each was a sort of rude garden , denominated , in the ruder language of the country , a " truck-patch . " Beyond this lay a small field , a part of which had produced a crop of oats , while on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to be gathered . Add to this a small meadow , and the reader will have an outline equally descriptive of each of the little farms which , for the distance of three miles , bordered the stream . But , though the valley thus bore the marks of a crowded population , a deep stillness pervaded it . The visible signs of life were few . Of sounds there were none . A solitary youngster , male or female , alone was seen loitering about every door . These , as the traveller passed along , would skulk from observation , and then steal out , and , mounting a fence , indulge their curiosity , at safe distances , by looking after him . At length he heard a sound of voices , and then a shrill whistle , and all was still . Immediately , some half a dozen men , leaping a fence , ranged themselves across the road and faced him . He observed that each , as he touched the ground , laid hold of a rifle that leaned against the enclosure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these formidable weapons , ranged along in the same position . The first impulse of the traveller was to draw a pistol ; but seeing that the men , as they posted themselves , rested their guns upon the ground and leaned upon them , he quietly withdrew his hand from his holster . It was plain that no violence was intended , and that this movement was nothing but a measure of precaution , such as the unsettled condition of the country required . He therefore advanced steadily but slowly , and , on reaching the party , reined in his horse , and silently invited the intended parley . The men , though somewhat variously attired , were all chiefly clad in half-dressed buck-skin . They seemed to have been engaged in gathering corn in the adjoining field . Their companions , who still continued the same occupation , seemed numerous enough ( including women and boys , of both of which there was a full proportion , ) to have secured the little crop in a few hours . Indeed , it would seem that the whole working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assembled there . As the traveller drew up his horse , one of the men , speaking in a low and quiet tone , said , " We want a word with you , stranger , before you go any farther . " " As many as you please , " replied the other , " for I am tired and hungry , and so is my horse ; and I am glad to find some one , at last , of whom I may hope to purchase something for both of us to eat . " " That you can have quite handy , " said the countryman , " for we have been gathering corn , and were just going to our dinner . If you will only just ' light , sir , one of the boys can feed your horse , and you can take such as we have got to give you . " The invitation was accepted ; the horse was taken in charge by a long-legged lad of fifteen , without hat or shoes ; and the whole party crossed the fence together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them , who , observing their approach , fell back a few steps , and threw himself on the ground at the foot of a large old apple-tree . Around this were clustered a motley group of men , women , and boys , who opened and made way for the stranger . He advanced , and , bowing gracefully , took off his forage cap , from beneath which a quantity of soft curling flaxen hair fell over his brow and cheeks . Every eye was now fixed on him , with an expression rather of interest than mere curiosity . Every countenance was serious and composed , and all wore an air of business , except that a slight titter was heard among the girls , who , hovering behind the backs of their mothers , peeped through the crowd , to get a look at the handsome stranger . He was indeed a handsome youth , about twenty years of age , whose fair complexion and regular features made him seem yet younger . He was tall , slightly , but elegantly formed , with a countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress was plain and cheap , though not unfashionable . A short grey coat , waistcoat , and pantaloons , that neatly fitted and set off his handsome person , showed by the quality of the cloth that his means were limited ; or that he had too much sense to waste , in foppery , that which might be better expended in the service of his suffering country . But , even in this plain dress , he was apparelled like a king in comparison with the rustics that surrounded him ; and his whole air would have passed him for a gentleman , in any dress and any company , where the constituents of that character are rightly understood . In the present assembly there seemed to be none , indeed , who could be supposed to have had much experience in that line . But dignity is felt , and courtesy appreciated by all , and the expression of frankness and truth is every where understood . As the youth approached , the man at the foot of the tree arose , and returned the salutation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , and invited the stranger to be seated . This action , and the looks turned toward him by the others , showed that he was in authority of some sort among them . With him , therefore , our traveller concluded that the proposed conference was to be held . There was nothing in his appearance which would have led a careless observer to assign him any preeminence . But a second glance might have discovered something intellectual in his countenance , with less of boorishness in his air and manner than the rest of the company displayed . In all , indeed , there was the negative courtesy of that quiet and serious demeanor which solemn occasions impart to the rudest and most frivolous . It was plain to see that they had a common purpose , and that neither ferocity nor rapacity entered into their feeling toward the new-comer . Whether he was to be treated as a friend or an enemy , obviously depended on some high consideration , not yet disclosed . He was at length asked whence he came , and answered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ?  --  From the north side . Did he know any thing of Van Courtlandt ?  --  His camp was at Bacon 's branch , just above the town . What force had he ? " I can not say , certainly , " he replied , " but common fame made his numbers about four thousand . " " Is that all , on both sides of the river ? " said his interrogator . " O , no ! Col. Loyal 's regiment is at Petersburg , and Col. Coles 's at Manchester ; each about five hundred strong ; and there is a piquet on the Bridge island . " " Did you cross there ? " " I did not . " " Where then ? " he was asked . " I can hardly tell you , " he replied , " it was at a private ford , several miles above Cartersville . " " Was not that mightily out of the way ? What made you come so far around ? " " It was safer travelling on that side of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river are your friends ? " " No . They are not . But , as they are all of a color there , they would let me pass , and ask no questions , as long as I travelled due west . On this side , if you are one man 's friend , you are the next man 's enemy ; and I had no mind to answer questions . " " You seem to answer them now mighty freely . " " That is true . I am like a letter that tells all it knows as soon as it gets to the right hand ; but it does not want to be opened before that . " " And how do you know that you have got to the right hand now ? " " Because I know where I am . " " And where are you ? " " Just at the foot of the Devil 's Back-bone , " replied the youth . " Were you ever here before ? " " Never in my life . " " How do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because the right way to avoid questions is to ask none . So I took care to know all about the road , and the country , and the place , before I left home . " " And who told you all about it ? " " Suppose I should tell you , " answered the young man , " that Van Courtlandt had a map of the country made , and gave it to me . " " I should say , you were a traitor to him , or a spy upon us , " was the stern reply . At the same moment , a startled hum was heard from the crowd , and the press moved and swayed for an instant , as if a sort of spasm had pervaded the whole mass . " You are a good hand at questioning , " said the youth , with a smile , " but , without asking a single question , I have found out all I wanted to know . " " And what was that ? " asked the other . " Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poor old Virginia . " " And which are we for ? " added the laconic mountaineer . " For old Virginia for ever , " replied the youth , in a tone in which exultation rung through a deeper emotion , that half stifled his voice . It reached the hearts of his auditors , and was echoed in a shout that pealed along the mountain sides their proud war-cry of " Old Virginia for ever . " The leader looked around in silence , but with a countenance that spoke all that the voices of his comrades had uttered . " Quiet boys , " said he , " never shout till the war is ended  --  unless it be when you see the enemy . " Then turning again to the traveller , he said , " And how did you know we were for old Virginia ? " " I knew it by the place where I find you . I heard it in your voice ; I saw it in their eyes ; and I felt in in my heart ; " said the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordial pressure with an iron grasp , strong , but not convulsive , and went on : " You are a sharp youth , " said he , " and if you are of the right metal that will hold an edge , you will make somebody feel it . But I do n't know rightly yet who that is to be , only just I will say , that if you are not ready to live and die by old Virginia , your heart and face are not of the same color , that 's all . " He then resumed his steady look , and quiet tone , and added , " You must not make me forget what I am about . How did you learn the way here ? " " I can answer that now ; " said the youth . " I learned it from Captain Douglas . " " Captain Douglas ! " exclaimed the other . " If you were never here before , you have never seen him since he knew it himself . " " True enough ; " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I should like to see his letter . " " I have no letter . " " How then ? " " Go with me to my horse , and I will show you . " The youth , accompanied by his interrogator , now returned toward the fence . Many of the crowd were about to follow ; but the chief ( for such he seemed ) waved them back-with a silent motion of his hand , while a glance of meaning at two of the company invited them to proceed . As soon as the stranger reached his horse , he drew out , from between the padding and seat of his saddle , a paper closely folded . On opening this , it was found to be a map of his route from Richmond to a point in the mountains , a few miles west of the spot where they stood . On this were traced the roads and streams , with the names of a few places , written in a hand which was known to the leader of the mountaineers to be that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traveller had been directed to pursue . He said that , after crossing the river , between Lynchburg and Cartersville , to avoid the parties of the enemy stationed at both places , he had lain by , until dark , at the house of a true Virginian . Then , turning south , and riding hard all night , he had crossed the Appomattox above Farmville , ( which he avoided for a like reason , ) and , before day , had left behind him all the hostile posts and scouting parties . He soon reached the Staunton river , and , having passed it , resumed his westward course in comparative safety . " You know this hand , " said he to the chief , " and now , I suppose , you are satisfied . " " I am satisfied , " replied the other , " and glad to see you . I have not a doubt about you , young man , and you are heartily welcome among us  --  to all we can give you  --  and that a n't much  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will depend upon whether stout hearts , and willing minds , and good rifles can help you . But you said you were hungry ; so , I dare say , you 'll be glad enough of a part of our sorry dinner . " CHAPTER II . Heus ! etiam Mensas consumimus . Virgil . Returning to the party which they had left , they found the women in the act of placing their meal before them , under the apple-tree . There was a patch of grass there , but no shade ; nor was any needed in that lofty region ; the frost had already done it 's work by stripping the trees of their leaves , and letting in the welcome rays of the sun through the naked branches . The meal consisted of fresh pork and venison , roasted or broiled on the coals , which looked tempting enough , though served up in wooden trays . There were no knives but such as each hunter carries in his belt . Our traveller 's dirk supplied the place of one to him . Their plates were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked in the ashes , so that , like the soldiers of neas , each man ate up his platter before his hunger was appeased . Our traveller , though sharp-set , could not help perceiving a woful inspidity in his food , for which his entertainer apologized . " We ha'nt got no salt to give you , stranger , " said he . " The little that 's made on the waters of Holston , is all used there ; and what comes by way of the sound is too dear for the like of us , that fight one half the year , and work the other half , and then with our rifles in our hands . As long as we let the Yankees hold James river , we must make up our minds to eat our hogs when they are fat , and to do without salt to our bread . But it is not worth grumbling about ; and bread without salt is more than men deserve that will give up their country without fighting for it . " When the meal was finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his entertainers , asked what was to pay , and proposed to continue his journey . " As to what you are to pay , my friend , " said the spokesman of the party , in the same cold , quiet tone , " that is just nothing . If you come here by Captain Douglas 's invitation , you are one of us ; and if you do not , we are bound to find you as long as we keep you . But , as to your going just yet , it is quite against our rules . " " How is that ? " asked the traveller , with some expression of impatience . " That is what I can not tell you ; " replied the other . " But what right , " exclaimed the youth  --  then checking himself , he added : " But I see you mean nothing but what is right and prudent ; and you must take your own way to find out all you wish to know about me . But I thought you said you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied the other ; " but that is not the thing . May be , our rules are not satisfied , though I am . " " And what are your rules ? " " It is against rule to tell them , " said the mountaineer , drily . " But make yourself easy , stranger . We mean you no harm , and I will see and have every thing laid straight before sun-rise . You are heartily welcome . Such as we 've got we give you ; and that is better than you will find where you are going . For our parts , except it be for salt , we are about as well off here as common ; because there is little else we use that comes from foreign parts . I dare say , it will go hard with you for a while , sir ; but , if your heart 's right , you will not mind it , and you will soon get used to it . " " It would be a great shame , " said the youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have borne for life . " " Yes , " said the other , " that is the way people talk . But ( axing your pardon , sir , ) there a n't no sense in it . Because the longer a man bears a thing , the less he minds it ; and after a while , it a n't no hardship at all . And that 's the way with the poor negroes that the Yankees pretended to be so sorry for , and tried to get them to rise against their masters . There 's few of them , stranger , but what 's happier than I am ; but I should be mighty unhappy , if you were to catch me now , in my old days , and make a slave of me . So when the Yankees want to set the negroes free , and to make me a slave , they want to put us both to what we are not fit for . And so it will be with you for a while , among these mountains , sleeping on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread either , may be . But after a while you will not mind it . But as to whether it is to be long or short , young man , you must not think about that . You have no business here , if you have not made up your mind to stand the like of that for life ; and may be that not so mighty long neither . " At this moment a signal from the road gave notice of the approach of a traveller ; and the leader of the mountaineers , accompanied by his guest , went forward in obedience to it . But , before he reached the fence , he saw several of the party leap it , and run eagerly forward to meet the new-comer . A little man now appeared , walking slowly and wearily , whose dress differed but little from that of the natives ; and who bore , like them , a rifle , with its proper accompaniments of knife , tomahawk and powderhorn . His arrival awakened a tumult of joy among the younger persons present , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking toward him with a countenance in which an expression of thoughtful interest was mingled with a sort of quiet satisfaction , and great kindness and good will . Yet he moved but a step to meet him , and extending his hand , said , in his usual cold tone , " How is it , Schwartz ? " to which the other , in a voice somewhat more cherry , replied " Well ; how is it with you Witt ? " " Well , " was the grave answer . The two now drew apart to converse privately together . Crossing the road , they seated themselves on the fence in front of the stranger , so that during their conference they could keep an eye on him . " Who is this you have got here ? " asked Schwartz . " A young fellow that says he wants to go to the camp , " replied the other . " Has he got the word and signs ? " " No . He does not know any thing about it . I have a notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What makes you think so ? " " He has got a paper in the captain 's hand-write to show him the way . But there 's no name to it ; and if there was , I could not tell that he was the man . Sure and sartain the captain wrote the paper , but then somebody may have stolen it . A man that knows as much about the country as he does , after looking at that paper and travelling by it away here , is the last man we ought to let go any farther , or know any more , unless he is of the right sort . " " I should like to see that paper ; " said Schwartz . " Here it is , " replied his companion . " I do n't much mistrust the young fellow ; but I did not like to let him have it again till I knew more . " Schwartz now looked at the paper and enquired the stranger 's name . " I did not ask his name , " said Witt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased . As there was no name on the paper , it did not make any odds . Besides , I wanted to be civil to him , and your high gentlemen down about Richmond are affronted sometimes if you ask their names . The young fellow is all right , or all wrong , any how ; and his name do n't make any odds . If the captain knows him , when he sees him , it 's all one what his name is . " " But I know , " said Schwartz , " who ought to have that paper ; and if he do n't answer to that name it 's no use troubling the captain with him . " " I should be sorry for any harm to him , " said Witt , " for he is a smart lad ; and if he is not a true Virginian , then he is the greatest hypocrite that ever was born . " They now recrossed the road , and Schwartz , addressing the stranger , said , " I must make so bold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young fellow colored , and , turning to Witt , said , " I thought you were satisfied , and done asking questions . " " So I was , " said Witt , " but there is a reason for asking your name now , that I did not know of . I owe you nothing but good will , young man , " added he with earnest solicitude ; " and if your name is what I hope it is , be sure by all means and tell the truth ; for there is but one name in the world that will save your neck . " " Then I shall tell you no name at all , " rejoined the youth , somewhat appalled at this startling intimation . " Why did not you ask me at once , when I was in the humor to keep nothing from you . I was willing to answer any civil question , or indeed any question you would have put to me , but I will not submit to be examined , over and over , by every chance-comer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man , " replied Witt . " This is no chance-comer . He is my head man , and I am just nobody when he is here . " Surprised at this ascription of authority to the diminutive and mean-looking new-comer , our traveller looked at him again , and was confirmed in a resolution to resist it . He had patiently borne to be questioned by Witt , who had something of an air of dignity . He was a tall , clean-limbed , and powerful man , of about forty , remarkable for the sobriety of his demeanor , and the thoughtful gravity of his countenance . The other was a little , old fellow , not less than sixty years of age , in whose manner and carriage there was nothing to supply the want of dignity in his diminutive form and features . A sharp little black eye was the only point about him to attract attention : and in that the youth thought he saw an impertinent and knowing twinkle , which rendered his inquiries yet more offensive . " I thought , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain . " " So he is , " was his reply . " That is , he commands all here . But that is only so long as we choose . I did not tell you this was my captain . He is no captain , nor lieutenant , nor ensign neither . But all of us here follow him ; and , when he is away , the rest follow me . " " You all follow him ! " said the traveller , looking contemptuously on the puny figure before him . " To be sure they do ; " said Schwartz , with a quizzieal smile , and answering the stranger 's thoughts . " To be sure they do . Do n't you see I am the likeliest man here ? " " I can not say I do , " said the youth , offended at the impertinent manner of the question . " Well , I am the strongest man in the whole company . " " I should hardly think that ; " replied the traveller , scornfully . " Any how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing . " That you must own . What ! do you dispute that too ? Well then , look here , stranger ! I ha'nt got no commission , and these men are as free as I am . What do you think makes them obey my orders ? " " I really can not say , " replied the young man . " Well , " said Schwartz , " it is a curious business , and well worth your considering ; because , you see , I have a notion if you could find that out , you would find out a pretty good reason why you ought to tell me your name . But that is your business . Some name you must have , and the right one too . And you see , stranger , it makes no odds whether it is no name or the wrong one . It is all the same thing ; because , if you are the man that ought to have that paper , you would tell your name in a minute . " " Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " May be I do , " said Schwartz . " Question for question , " said the other . " Do you know ? " " I do . " " Well , then , my name is Arthur Trevor . Is that right ? " " That 's as it may be , " said Schwartz . " But now I want to know how you came by this paper . " " What need you care about that , if I am the person that ought to have it . " " Just because I want to know if you are the one that ought have it . " " I tell you , " replied the youth , " that my name is Arthur Trevor . " " But I do not know that it is , " replied Schwartz , carelessly . " Do you doubt my word , then ? " exclaimed the youth ; his eye flashing , and the blood rushing to his face , as if it would burst through his clear skin . " Look here , stranger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't mean no offence , and you 'll think so too , if you 'll just look at it rightly ; because , you see , I do n't know who you are . I do n't doubt Arthur Trevor 's word ; and , if you are Arthur Trevor , I do n't doubt your word . Now , if you have my way to show that you are Arthur Trevor you have but to do it , and it will set all as straight as if I had axed you ten thousand pardens. " " with show who I am . The name of have brought into trouble some parts of the country . " " That is true enough ; " replied Schwartz , " and I asked you how you came by the paper , because I know how Arthur Trevor should have come by and , if you got it that way , why than you are the very man . " By time the youth saw the of his anger , and answered , , that from a man saw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing , was " " Did he give you any thing the ? " " Yes ; he gave this ; " said the youth , producing a dirty piece of paper , on which these words : " . If you go of a jurney , ry this with you , it mout be of sarvice to you . " " Well , " said Schwartz , " that will do . You are Arthur Trevor , sure enough . And I reckon , Witt , you would have said so too , if you had seen this . " Witt looked at the paper , and merely nodded assent . " Well , said the young man , " now I suppose I may go on to my friend . " " Not just yet , " said Schwartz . " Why so ? " asked the youth , again relapsing into petulance . " Just because you could not get there , " was the answer . " Why not , " said he , " after finding my way thus far . " " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther if I had not come . You would meet with rougher customers than these between here and the camp . Come , come , my son . You must learn to take things easy . The captain has not got a better friend than me in the world ; nor you neither , if you did but know all . And , you see , you are going to a new trade ; and I thought I would just give you a lesson . Now you may see , that , when you mean nothing but what is fair and honorable , ( and you always know how that is , ) the naked truth is your best friend ; and then , the sooner it comes the better . I am pretty much of an old fox ; and I reckon I have told more lies than you ever dreamed of , but , for all that , I have seen the day when the truth was better than the cunningest lie that ever was told . And then again , it a n't no use to mind what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , you see , it a n't you he is talking to , but just a stranger . " " But I have travelled desperate hard to-day , Witt , " continued Schwartz ; " and I must push on to the camp to-night . So just give me a mouthful , and I 'll be off , and pilot Mr. Trevor through among the guards . " " My horse is at your service , as you are tired , " said Arthur , whose feelings toward his new acquaintance were now quite mollified . " I have had riding enough for one day , " said Schwartz ; " and was glad enough to get to where I could leave my horse . It a n't much good a horse will do you , or me either , where we are going . By the time we climb to the top of the Devil 's Back-bone , you 'll be more tired than me ; and the horse will be worst off of any . " He now told one of the boys to make ready Arthur 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rifle . " It will not do , " said he , " to starve when a man is on fatigue , and it will not do to eat too much . And see here , Witt , " added he , taking him apart , and speaking in a low tone , " if a long-legged , red-headed fellow comes along here , and tells you he is from Currituck , and seems to think he knows all the signs , never let him find out but what he does . Only just make an excuse to keep him a Page image - Page 024 . CHAPTER III .  --  The forest 's shady scene , Where things that own not man 's dominion dwell , And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been .  --  Byron . The travellers now moved off together , Arthur walking , and leading his horse . They soon reached a point where a sharp ridge , jutting like a buttress from the side of the mountain , came down abruptly to the very bank of the rivulet . Up this ridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path led . Leaning , as it were , against the mountain  --  its position , the narrow , ridgy edge along which the traveller clambered , and the rough nodules which interrupted the ascent , like the notches in a hen 's ladder , gave it no small resemblance to this housewifely contrivance . The steep descent on either hand into deep dells , craggy and hirsute with stinted trees bristling from the sides , together with the similarity of these same nodules to the joints of the spine , had suggested a name strictly descriptive of the place . The ruggedness , steepness , and vast height of the ascent , would naturally provoke some spiteful epithet ; and were the spot to be named again , a hundred to one it would receive the same name , and no other . At the summit of this narrow stair , the travellers stopped to take breath , and look back on the scene below . Arthur , who was at the romantic age when young men are taught to affect an enthusiasm for the beauties of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shade , and prospects in all the variety of the grand , the beautiful , and the picturesque , had been feasting his imagination with the thought of the glorious view to be seen from the pinnacle before him . Like an epicure about to feast on turtle , who will not taste a biscuit beforehand lest he should spoil his dinner , so our young traveller steadily kept his face toward the hill as he ascended it . Even when he stopped to take breath , he was careful not to look behind . Schwartz , on the contrary , who was in advance , always faced about on such occasions , filling the pauses with conversation , and looking as if unconscious of the glorious scene over which his eye glanced unheeding . Arthur was vexed to see such indifference , and wondered whether this was the effect of use , or of the total absence of a faculty of which poets so much delight to speak . At length the summit was attained ; and now the youth looked around in anticipated exultation . At first he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of his matter-of-fact companion , exclaimed : " Oh ! how grand ! How beautiful ! " " For my part , " said Schwartz , indifferently , " I can not say that I see any thing at all rightly , except it be the little branch down there , with its patches of meadow and corn-fields , and its smoky cabins . In the spring of the year , when you can not see the cabins for the shaders , and the corn , and oats , and meadow is all of a color , it looks mightily like a little green snake . What it is like just now , I can not say , as I never saw one of them snakes half-scaled , and with a parcel of warts on his back : but I have a notion he would look pretty much so . As to any thing else  --  there is something there , to be sure , but what it is , I am sartain I could never tell , if I did not know . And as to the distance I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , the less you see , that 's all ; until you get away yonder , t' other side of nowhere ; and then you see just nothing at all . " " But the vastness of the view ! " said Arthur . " The idea of immensity ! " " As to that , " replied Schwartz , " you have only just to look right up , and you can look a heap farther , and still see nothing . All the difference is , you know it is nothing ; and down there , you know there is something , and you can not see what it is . " " I am afraid your eyes are bad , " said Arthur . " I can not see as well as I could once , " replied Schwartz ; " but if there was any thing to be seen down there , I should be right apt to see it . I have clomb this hill , Mr. Trevor , when I could see the head of a nail in a target fifty yards off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I saw any thing more then than . I do now ; and that is only just because there a n't nothing there to see .  --  I God ! but there is , though ! There 's that chap a coming along ; and I must see the Captain , and tell him all about it before he comes . " " I see nobody , " said Arthur . " That is because you do n't look in the right place , " replied Schwartz . " Look along the road . " " I do n't see the road , except just at the foot of the mountain . " " Well ! Look through the sights of my rifle . There ! Do n't you see a man on horseback ? " " I see something moving , " said Arthur ; " but I can not tell what it is . " " Well , " said Schwartz , " when he comes , you 'll see it 's a man riding on a white horse , and then , may be , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see that too . " He now sounded a small whistle , which hung by a leathern thong from his shoulder-belt . The signal was answered from the point of a projecting crag which jutted out from the face of the cliff , not more than fifty yards off . At the same moment , a man was seen to rise up from behind a rock , which had hitherto concealed him ; though , from his lookout place , he must have had a distinct view of our travellers from the moment they left the valley . He now approached and accosted Schwartz in a manner which showed that he had already recognized him . Schwartz returned the salutation , and , pointing out the man on the white horse , said : " If that fellow should happen to get by without their seeing him , I want you just to fall in with him , like as if you was a hunting , and so go with him to the piquet . Never let on but he knows all the signs , and keep with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him believe that is the camp , and that the Captain will be there after a while ; and so keep him there till the Captain comes . " Having said this , he again turned his eye toward the object moving below , and gazed intently for a few minutes . Arthur , in the mean time , was left to admire the prospect , and soon began to suspect that Schwartz 's ideas of the picturesque were not so far wrong . Indeed , there is nothing to admire from the spot , but the road that leads to it . From the foot of the mountain to the coast , there is an expanse of nearly three hundred miles , with no secondary ridges . As seen from that elevation , the whole is level to the eye , and presents one sheet of unbroken forest . Arthur found time to correct his preconceptions by the testimony of his own senses , while Schwartz continued to observe the movements of the distant traveller . At last he said : " That will do . They have stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They now moved on quietly through a forest of lofty chestnuts , and along a path which wound its way among the scorched trunks of innumerable trees , prostrated by the fires that annually sweep through such uninhabited fracts . The soil seemed fertile , and abounding in luxuriant though coarse pasturage ; and the high table-land of the mountain was more level than the peopled district below . Yet all was solitary and silent ; nor was a vestige of habitation seen for miles . On inquiring the cause of this , Arthur was told that the country , at that elevation , was too cold to be inviting , as nothing would grow there but grass and oats , and that it was all shingled over with conflicting patents . " They that claim the land , " said Schwartz , " will not go to law about it with one another : because they would have to survey it , and that would cost a mint of money ; so they all club to keep it as a summer range for their stock . It belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not long done speaking , when he suddenly stopped , and , raising his rifle , fired , and began quietly to load again . " What did you shoot at ? " asked Arthur , looking in the direction of the shot . " A monstrous fine buck , " replied Schwartz . " Where is he ? I did not see him . " " You did not look in the right place . He is down and kicking ; and I always like to load my gun before I go up to them , because , you see , a deer , when he is wounded , is as dangerous as a painter . " " A painter ! " said Arthur . " What harm is there in a painter , more than another man ? " " O ! " said Schwartz , laughing , " it a n't no man at all . I do n't just rightly know how you high larnt gentlemen call his name , but he is as ugly a varmint as you 'd wish to see ; most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of them and puts them in a cage ; and then they call them tigers . I God ! I catched a young one once and sold him to one of these fellows ; and the next time I seed him , he was carrying the cretur about with him for a show . And he did not remember me ; and so I axed him what it was ; and he said ' t was an Effrican tiger right from Duck river ! Lord ! how the folks did laugh ; ' cause you see , sir , Duck river is just a little way down here in Tennessee , not over five hundred miles off ; and Effrica , they tell me , is away t' other side of the herring-pond , where the negurs come from . " By this time the rifle was loaded , and they advanced toward the fallen deer . They were quite near before Arthur discovered him ; and , at the moment , the animal ( a noble buck of ten branches ) recovered himself so far as to regain his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his enemy seemed , at once , to stiffen his limbs with horror , and give them strength to support him . In an instant his formidable antlers were pointed ; and , with eyes glaring and blood-shot , and his hair all turned the wrong way , he was in act to spring forward . At the instant , the report of the rifle was again heard , and , pitching on the points of his horns , he turned fairly heels over head , and lay with his legs in air , and quivering in death . Schwartz now drew his knife across the animal 's throat , and proceeded to disembowel him , when Arthur asked what he would do with the carcass . " I 'll just hang him up in a sapling , " said he , " till I meet one of our men . There ought to be one close by , and I can send him for him . Where there 's a hundred mouths to feed , such a buck as this is a cash article . " At this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , looking up , he saw a man approaching . " I do n't know that fellow , " said he , looking hard at him . " But it 's all one . I can make him know me . " The usual salutation now passed , and the stranger said : " If I may be so bold , stranger , I 'd be glad to know what parts you are from ? " " From Passamaquoddy , " said Schwartz . " Can you tell me the price of skins down there away ? " " Twenty-five cents and a quarter a pound , " replied Schwartz . A few more simple questions and out-of-the-way answers were exchanged , when Schwartz , addressing the other , in an under tone , said : " You are one of the new recruits , I reckon ? " The other nodded ; and Schwartz went on to ask their number . Being told they were fifty , he said , gravely : " Now , there you are wrong . You are right enough to pass me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no reason you should tell me any thing . I just asked you , you see , to give you a ' caution ; cause a fellow might come along here that would give you the word as straight as any body , and be a spy all the time . So the right way would be , just to pass him and keep dark , that 's the rule ; and , by the time he 'd find out how many men we 've got , may be he 'd find out something else he would not like quite so well . But come , let us take the deer up to the road , and you can walk your post and watch it , till I can send somebody for it from the piquet . " The sturdy mountaineer at once shouldered the animal ; and , striding along to the road , threw him down , and quietly betook himself to eating the chestnuts that covered the ground . The traveller moved on , and presently came to the piquet . Here was a small party quartered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enclosure around a beautiful fountain , that welled up from a natural basin of stone . In this were confined twenty or thirty calves . A few horses were piqueted at hand , and the sides of the adjoining hills were covered with a numerous herd of fat cattle , browsing on the faded , but still succulent vegetation . The time was come when they should have been driven down for the winter , to the farms of their owners below , but they were left here that the men might have the use of the milk . Should their hunting at any time prove unsucessful , there was always a beef at hand . Here Schwartz was known , and joyfully welcomed . He stopped only to tell of the deer , and moved on . " You have a curious system here , " said Arthur ; " I see the people here know you , but how did you manage with that new recruit . I watched you , and I did not see you give him any sign , and he did not ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what foolish answers I gave to his questions . You see , we ha'nt got no countersign rightly ; ' cause you see , when I stop a man , I want to know who he is , but I do n't want to tell him any thing about myself . But if I ax a man for the countersign , just so I might as well tell him I am on guard at once . So we 've just got , may be , twenty simple questions ; and when we ask them , our own folks know what answer to give , and the answer is sure to be one that nobody would give unless he was in the secret . " " And pray how did you find out that I was Arthur Trevor ? " " O ! nothing easier , sir . That man , that gave you the map , was not no more lame than you . But I told him to be sure and not give it to nobody but you , and then to limp so as you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I that was to try fall in with you , and pilot you ; but , after that , I got upon another scheme . As to the other paper , that was to serve you with our folks , because there was a mark there you did not notice , that any of them would know ; and then they would be middling sure you were the man you said you were . They would have been civil to you , and let you pass , but then they would have sent a man or two to the camp with you . And now , Mr. Trevor , here is something that I can see , and I have a notion it 's worth looking at . " While he was yet speaking , Arthur 's ears had been saluted by a brawling sound , which he now recognized as the rush of water . Turning his head toward it , he perceived that it proceeded from a deep and shaggy dell , which the path was now approaching , and along the verge of which it presently wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vast depth , at the bottom of which a considerable stream was seen . It dashed rapidly along , pouring it 's sparkling waters over successive barriers of yellow rock , that sent up a golden gleam from beneath the crystal sheet that covered them . The mountain-pine , the fir , the kalmia , and numberless other evergreens , which nearly filled the gorge , afforded only occasional glimpses of the water ; while they set off the picturesque appearance of so much as they permitted to be seen . As they advanced , they came to a part where the trees had been cut from the brow of the cliff ; and , several of those below having been removed , a clearer view was afforded . Here , at the depth of two hundred feet , figures were seen moving to and fro , while , right opposite , under a beetling cliff , that screened them from above , were groups clustered around fires , kindled against the rock , behind a rude breast-work of logs . The whole breadth of the stream was here exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though shallow , by reason of its rapidity it seemed to pour a vast volume of water . Standing on the brow of the cliff , Schwartz now uttered a shout , and immediately half a dozen men , seizing their rifles , moved up the glen , and were soon hidden under the bank on which the travellers stood . They now went on , and presently reached a point at which the path , turning short to the left , dived into the abyss , leading down a rugged ledge that sloped along the face of the cliff , in the direction opposite to that of their approach . It reached the very bottom , nearly under the point from which the shout of Schwartz had given notice of his presence . Here he stopped ; and , requesting Arthur to wait a moment , he descended . He had not gone far before his name was repeated by a dozen voices , and immediately he was heard to say : " Yes , it is Schwartz ; and I have a friend with me . " " Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwartz , returning , requested Arthur to follow him , and mind his footing . Arthur obeyed , and descended , not without some appearance of danger , sometimes leaping and sometimes crawling , until he reached the group stationed at the foot of this rude stairway . Here let us leave him for a while , and go back to enquire who and whence he was . CHAPTER IV .  --  Handmaid of Prudence , Fortune comes Prompt to her bidding , ready to fulfil Her mistress ' pleasure ; whether she demand The treasures of the South , the applause of men , Or the calm sunshine of domestic bliss , Lo ! they are hers ! Anonymous . Arthur Trevor was the youngest son of a gentleman who resided in the neighborhood of Richmond . He was a man in affluent circumstances , and had long and honorably filled various important and dignified stations in the service of his native State . Endowed with handsome talents , an amiable disposition , and all the accomplishments that can adorn a gentleman , he added to these the most exemplary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been great , and though now , at the age of seventy , withdrawn from public life , his opinions were enquired of , and his counsel sought , by all who had access to him . Through life he had been remarkable for firmness , and yet more for prudence . The steadiness of his principles could never be questioned , but , it was thought , he had sometimes deemed it wise to compromise , when men of less cautious temper would have found safety in prudent boldness . To this temperament had been attributed his conduct in regard to the politics of the last twenty years . Bred up in the school of State rights , and thoroughly imbued with its doctrines , he had , even before that time , been accustomed to look , with a jealous eye , on the progressive usurpations of the Federal Government . In the hope of arresting these , he had exerted more than his usual activity in aiding to put down the younger Adams , and to elevate his successor . Though no candidate for the spoils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that contest ; and , until the emanation of the proclamation of December , 1832 , he had given his hearty approbation , and steady , though quiet support , to the administration of Andrew Jackson . From that moment he seemed to look with fearful bodings on the affairs of his country . His disapprobation of that instrument was expressed with as much freedom and force as was consistent with his habitual reserve and moderation . He was , indeed , alarmed into a degree of excitement unusual with him , and might have gone farther than he did , had he not found that others were disposed to go , as he thought , too far . He had entirely disapproved the nullifying ordinance of South Carolina ; and , though he recognized the right of secession , he deprecated all thought of resorting to that remedy . He was aware that many of his best friends , thinking that its necessity would be eventually felt by all , feared that that conviction might come too late . They remarked the steady tendency of Federal measures to weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources of their northern oppressors and those of the General Government . Hence they feared , that whenever Virginia , or any other of the slave-holding States , should find itself driven to secession , the other party , in the confidence of superior strength , might be tempted forcibly to resist the exercise of the right . They thus arrived at the conclusion that separation ( which they deemed inevitable ) to be peaceable , must be prompt . These ideas had been laid before Mr. Trevor , and , in proportion to the urgency with which they were pressed , was his alarm and his disposition to adhere to the Union . He , at last , had brought himself to believe union , on any terms , better than disunion , under any circumstances . As the lesser evil , therefore , he determined to forget the proclamation , and , striving to reconcile himself to all the acts of the administration , he regarded every attempt to unite the South , in support of a southern president , as a prelude to the formation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Martin Van Buren ; and united with Ritchie , and others of the same kidney , in endeavoring to subdue the spirit , and tame down the State pride of Virginia . These endeavors , aided by the lavish use of federal patronage in the State , were so far successful , that when , at the end of Van Buren 's second term , he demanded a third election , she alone , in the South , supported his pretensions . By the steady employment of the same pernicious influences , the elections throughout the State had been so regulated , as to produce returns of a majority of members devoted to the views of the usurper . This had continued until the spring of 1848 , at which time the results of the elections were essentially the same which had taken place since the memorable 1836 ; when Virginia , at one stroke of the pen , expunged her name from the chronicles of honor , expunged the history of all her glories , expunged herself . From that time the land of Washington , and Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sunk to the rank of a province , administered and managed by the Riveses and Ritchies , the Barbours and Stevensons , the Watkinses and Wilsons , whose chance to be remembered in history depends , like that of Erostratus , on the glories of that temple of liberty which they first desecrated and then destroyed . " Where once the Csars dwelt , " There dwelt , tuneless , the birds of night . " From some cause , not understood at the time , an unexpected reaction had taken place between the spring elections and the recurrence of that form of presidential election in the fall , the observance of which was still deemed necessary to display , and , by displaying , to perpetuate the usurper 's power . This reaction appeared to show itself chiefly in those counties heretofore most distinguished for their loyalty . It would have seemed as if the spirit of John Randolph had risen from the sleep of death , and walked abroad through the scenes where his youthful shoulders had received the mantle of his eloquence from the hand of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote of Virginia was recorded against the re-election of Martin Van Buren to the presidential throne . But not the less subservient were the proceedings of the Legislature elected for his use , the spring before . Yet enough had been done to justify the hope that the ancient spirit of old Virginia would yet show itself in the descendants of the men who had defied Cromwell , in the plenitude of his power , and had cast off the yoke of George the Third , without waiting for the co-operation of the other colonies . At the same time , the power and the will of a fixed majority in the North , to give a master to the South , had been made manifest . It was clearly seen , too , that he had determined to use the power thus obtained , and to administer the government solely with a view to the interest of that sectional faction , by which he had been supported . " V victis ! " " Woe to the vanquished ! " was the word . It had gone forth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hand in hand , to the plunder and desolation of the South . Under these circumstances , the southern States had been , at length , forced to see that the day for decisive action had arrived . They therefore determined no longer to abide the obligations of a constitution , the forms of which alone remained , and having , by a movement nearly simultaneous , seceded from the Union , they had immediately formed a southern confederacy . The suddenness of these measures was less remarkable than the prudence with which they had been conducted . The two together left little doubt that there had been a preconcert among the leading men of the several States , arranging provisionally what should be done , whenever circumstances should throw power into hands of those whom , at the bidding of the usurper , the people had once driven from their councils . It is now known that there was such concert . Nor was it confined to the seceding States alone . In Virginia , also , there were men who entered into the same views . But while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the more southern States without her co-operation , he had devoted all his power , direct and indirect , to control and influence her elections . Of tumultuary insurrection he had no fear . The organized operation of the State Government was what he dreaded . By this alone could the measure of secession be effected ; and this was effectually prevented by operating on the elections of members of the Legislature . From the November vote on the presidential election , less evil had been apprehended , and less pains had been taken to control it . In consequence of this , something more of the real sentiments of the people had been allowed to appear on that occasion ; and , from this manifestation , the more southern States were encouraged to hope for the ultimate accession of Virginia to their confederacy . They had therefore determined to wait for her no longer , but to proceed to the execution of their plan , leaving her to follow . The disposition of the usurper , at first , was to treat them as revolted provinces ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to his authority . But circumstances , to be mentioned hereafter , made it impolitic to resort to this measure . But these did not operate to prevent him from using the most efficacious means to prevent Virginia from following their example . Though restrained from attacking them , nothing prevented him from affecting to fear an attack from them . This gave a pretext for raising troops ; and the position of Virginia , as the frontier State , afforded an excuse for stationing them within her borders . Under these pretences , small corps were established in many of the disaffected counties . Should the presence of these be ineffectual to secure the return of delegates devoted to the crown , an ultimate security was taken against the action of the Legislature . Richmond , the seat of government , became the head-quarters of the army of observation , as it was called , and , surrounded by this , the mock deliberations of the General Assembly were to be held . The money thus thrown into the country seduced the corrupt , while terror subdued the timid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things had a contrary effect . He now , when it was too late , saw and lamented the error of his former overcaution . He now began to suspect that they had been right who had urged him , eighteen years before , to lend his aid in the work of arousing the people to a sense of their danger , and preparing them to meet it as one man . CHAPTER V. A sponge that soaks up the King 's countenance . Hamlet . Among those who had been most prompt to take this view of the subject , and most vehement in recommending it , was a younger brother of Mr. Trevor . In all , but the great essentials of moral worth , this gentleman was the very reverse of his brother . The difference was , perhaps , mainly attributable to the character of his intellect . Quick in conception , and clear in his views , he was strong in his convictions , and habitually satisfied with his conclusions . This , added to a hasty temper , gave him the appearance and character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of the progress of public opinion , and too impatient to wait for it . His ill success in life seemed to justify this construction . Though eminently gifted by nature , and possessing all the advantages of education , he had never occupied any of those stations in which distinction is to be gained . In his private affairs , he had been alike unprosperous . Though his habits were not expensive , his patrimony had been but little increased by his own exertions . He had married a lady of handsome property , but had added little to it . With only two daughters , he had not the means of endowing them with more than a decent competency ; while his elder brother , with a family of a dozen children , had educated the whole , had provided handsomely for such as had set out in life , and retained the wherewithal to give the rest nearly as much as the children of the younger could expect . In short , the career of Mr. Hugh Trevor had been one of uninterrupted prosperity . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed into his coffers , and honors had been showered on his head . " When the eye saw him , then it blessed him . " Men pointed him out to their children , and said to them : " Copy his example , and follow in his steps . " The life of Bernard , the younger brother , had been passed in comparative obscurity . Beloved by a few , but misunderstood by many , his existence was unknown to the multitude , and unheeded by most who were aware of it . They , indeed , who knew him well , saw in him qualities which , under discreet regulation , might have won for him distinction and affluence . None knew him better , and none saw this more clearly , than his elder brother . No man gave him more credit for talent and honor , or less for prudence and common sense . A habit of doubting the correctness of his opinions , and condemning his measures , had thus taken possession of the mind of Mr. Hugh Trevor : and , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a conclusion , the knowledge of that created , in the other , a predisposition to arrive at a different result . In proportion as the one was clear , so did the other doubt . When the former was ardent , the latter was always cold ; and in all matters in which they had a common interest , the cautious foresight of Hugh never failed to see a lion in the path which Bernard wished to pursue . They were the opposite poles of the same needle . The clear convictions of the latter on the subject of secession , had shaken the faith of the former in his own , and had finally driven him to the conclusion already intimated , " that union , on any terms , was better than disunion , under any circumstances . " The same habit of thinking had retarded the change , which the events of the last three years had been working in the mind of Mr. Hugh Trevor . His native candor and modesty made it easy for him to believe that he had been wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a corollary from this admission would be , that the inconsiderate and imprudent Bernard had , all the time , been right . Of the correctness of such an admission Mr. Trevor felt an habitual diffidence , that made him among the last to avow a change of opinion which , perhaps , commenced in no mind sooner than in his . But the change was now complete , and it brought to the conscientious old gentleman a conviction that on him , above all men , it was incumbent to spare no means in his power to remove the mischiefs of which he felt his own supineness to have been in part the cause . He was now a private man ; but he had sons . To have given a direction to their political course , might not have been difficult . But , in the act of repenting an acknowledged error , how could he presume so far on his new convictions , as to endeavor to bind them on the minds of others ? Was it even right to use any portion of his paternal influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children 's lives such a tendency as might lead them into error , to the disappointment of their hopes , and perhaps to crime ? The answer to these questions led to a determination to leave them to their own thoughts , guided by such lights as circumstances might throw upon these important subjects . It happened unfortunately , that , about the time of Mr. Van Buren 's accession to the presidency , his eldest son had just reached that time of life when it is necessary to choose a profession . Without any particular purpose of devoting him to the army , he had been educated at West Point . The favor of President Jackson had offered this advantage , which , by the father of so large a family , was not to declined . But the young man acquired a taste for military life , and , as there was no man in Virginia whom the new President was more desirous to bind to his service than Mr. Hugh Trevor , his wishes had been ascertained , and the ready advancement of his son was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastened by all means consistent with the rules of the service . Even these were sometimes violated in his favor . In one instance , he had been elevated over the head of a senior officer of acknowledged merit . The impatience of this gentleman , which tempted him to offer his resignation , had been soothed by a staff appointment , accompanied by an understanding that he should not , unnecessarily , be placed under the immediate command of young Trevor . The latter , at the date of which we speak , had risen to the command of a regiment , which was now encamped in the neighborhood of Washington , in daily expectation of being ordered on active duty . Colonel Owen Trevor had received his first impressions , on political subjects , at a time when circumstances made his father anxious to establish in his mind a conviction that union was the one thing needful . To the maintenance of this he had taught him to devote himself , and , overlooking his allegiance to his native State , to consider himself as the sworn soldier of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Trevor to teach his son to regard Virginia merely as a municipal division of a great consolidated empire . But while he taught him to act on precepts which seemed drawn from such premises , it was natural that the young man should adopt them . He did adopt them . He had learned to deride the idea of State sovereignty ; and his long residence in the North had given him a disgust at all that is peculiar in the manners , habits , institutions , and character of Virginia . Among his boon companions he had been accustomed to express these sentiments ; and , being repeated at court , they had made him a favorite there . He had been treated by the President with distinguished attention . He seemed honored , too , with the personal friendship of that favorite son , whom he had elevated to the chief command of the army . Him he had consecrated to the purple ; proposing to cast on him the mantle of his authority , so as to unite , in the person of his chosen successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was impossible that a young man , like Col. Trevor , should fail to feel himself flattered by such notice . He had been thought , when a boy , to be warm-hearted and generous , and his devotion to his patrons , which was unbounded , was placed to the account of gratitude by his friends . The President , on his part , was anxiously watching for an opportunity to reward this personal zeal , which is so strong a recommendation to the favor of the great . It was intimated to Col. Trevor that nothing was wanting to ensure him speedy promotion to the rank of brigadier , but some act of service which might be magnified , by a pensioned press , into a pretext for advancing him beyond his equals in rank . Apprised of this , he burned for active employment , and earnestly begged to be marched to the theatre of war . This theatre was Virginia . But he had long since ceased to attribute any political personality to the State , and it was a matter of no consequence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , had been born or resided there . Personally they were strangers to him ; and he only knew them as men denying the supremacy of the Federal Government , and hostile to the President and his intended successor . One person , indeed , he might possibly meet in arms , whom he would gladly avoid . His younger brother , Douglas Trevor , had been , like himself , educated at West Point , had entered the army , and served some years . Having spent a winter at home , it was suspected that he had become infected with the treasonable heresies of southern politicans . He had resigned his commission and travelled into South Carolina . The effect of this journey on his opinions was not a matter of doubt . Letters had been received from him , by his brother and several young officers of his own regiment , avowing a total change of sentiment . These letters left no doubt , that should Virginia declare for secession , or even in case of collison between the Southern League and the old United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowal of such sentiments and purposes had so excited the displeasure of the Colonel , that he had cut short the correspondence by begging that he might never again be reminded that he was the brother of a traitor . His letter , to this effect , being laid before the commander-in-chief , had given the most decisive proof of the zeal of one brother and the defection of the other . How this had been brought about , Colonel Trevor knew not . He was not aware of any alteration in his father 's sentiments ; and , indeed , Douglas himself had not been so , at the time when he was awakened to a sense of his country 's wrongs and his own duty . The change in his mind had been wrought by other means ; for his father was , at that time , doubting , and , with him , to doubt was to be profoundly silent . CHAPTER VI .  --  The boy is grown So like your brother that he seems his own .  --  Crabbe . Difference of political opinion had produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it had interrupted their intercouse by rendering it less agreeable . Men can not take much pleasure in each other 's society , when the subject on which both think and feel most deeply , is one on which they widely differ . They accordingly saw little of each other , though an occasional letter passed between them in token of unabated affection . I believe I have mentioned that the children of Mr. Bernard Trevor were both daughters . The eldest , then seventeen years of age , had been invited to spend with her uncle , in the vicinity of Richmond , the winter of Douglas 's furlough . He was at that time about five-and-twenty . His long residence in the North had not weaned him from his native State . He had not been flattered into a contempt of every thing Virginian . Neither his age nor rank gave him consequence enough to be the object of that sort of attention . Perhaps , too , it had been seen that he was a less fit subject for it than his elder brother . Though much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independence of thought , of which the other was incapable . Resting in the esteem of his friends and the approbation of his own conscience , the applause of the multitude , the flattery of sycophants , and the seducing attentions of superiors , had small charms for him . His heart had never ceased to glow at the name of Virginia , and he returned to her as the wanderer should return to the bosom of his home  --  to his friends  --  to his native land . In appearance , manners , and intelligence , he was much improved ; in feeling , the same warm-hearted , generous , unsophisticated youth , as formerly . In the meantime , his cousin Delia had already reached his father 's house , and was domesticated in the family . There she found the younger brothers and sisters of Douglas impatiently expecting his arrival ; and so much occupied with the thought of him , that , had she been of a jealous disposition , she might have deemed her welcome somewhat careless . But she already knew her cousins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time that their house was her temporary home ; and she had learned to consider herself as one of the family . As such , she was expected to enter into all their feelings . Douglas was their common favorite . During his long absence , his heart had never cooled toward them . In this he differed widely from Owen , in whom the pleasures of an idle life and the schemes of ambition had left little thought of the simple joys of his childhood 's home . The contrast between him and Douglas , in this respect , rendered the latter yet more popular with the single-hearted beings who were impatiently waiting his return . " Do you remember brother Douglas ? " said Virginia Trevor , ( a girl one year younger than Delia . ) " Mamma says you were a great pet with him , when a child , and used to call him your Douglas . " " I could not have been more than three years old at the time you speak of , " said Delia ; " but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to remember him . But , of course , I do not remember him . " " And , of course , he does not remember you , " said Mrs. Trevor . " At least he would not know you . But I doubt if he ever has forgotten you , as you were then . He was to be your husband , you know ; and your father gave him a set of rules to walk by . He was to do so and so , and to be so and so ; and Harry Sanford was to be his model . He said nothing about it ; but " Sanford and Merton " was hardly ever out of his hands , and we could see that he was always trying to square his conduct by your father 's maxims . I believe in my heart it made a difference in the boy ; and that is the reason why he is less like his own father , and more like yours , than any of the rest of my boys . " " I shall certainly love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling as she spoke , " if he is like my dear old father . " " Indeed , and you may , " said Mrs. Trevor ; " but , for all that , I would rather have him like his own father . But you must not be affronted , Delia ; you know I claim the right to brag about my old man , and to set him up over every body  --  even the President himself . " " I never saw the President , " said Delia , " but I should be sorry to compare my father with him . " " I can assure you , " replied the aunt , " there are very few men that would bear the comparison . O ! he is the most elegant , agreeable old gentleman , that ever I saw . " " Except my uncle , " said Delia , smiling . " Pshaw ! Yes , to be sure . I always except him . " " I will not except my father , " said Delia , gravely . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same breath . " " Well , my dear , " said the good-humored old lady , " we must not quarrel about it . But you must take care not to talk so before Douglas , because he is the President 's soldier . " " I thought , " said Delia , " he was in the service of the United States . " " Well ! and is not that all the same thing ? I do not pretend to know any thing about it , but my husband says so , and that is enough for me . " Mr. Trevor , who had sat by the while , listening , with grave complacency , now said : " I am afraid you do n't report me truly , my dear . " Then , extending his hand to Delia , he drew her gently to him , and placing her on his knee , kissed her . " You are a good girl , " said he , " and shall love and honor your father as much as you please . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I would to God , " added he , sighing heavily , " that I had had half his wisdom . " " Why , bless my soul , Mr. Trevor ! " exclaimed his wife , " what does this mean ? " " Nothing , " replied he , " but a just compliment to the self-renouncing generosity and far-sighted sagacity of my brother . " Saying this , he rose and left the room , while his wife gazed after him in amazement . She had never heard him say so much before , and now perceived that he had thoughts that she was not apprised of . Believing him faultless and incapable of error , even when he differed from himself , she at once concluded that she had lost her cue , and determined to say no more about politics until she recovered it . But he never adverted to the subject again , in her presence , during the whole winter ; and her niece , consequently , heard no farther allusion to it from her . This was no unwelcome relief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not incapable of understanding what passed in her presence on the subject , except when the interlocutors chose to mystify their meaning . Her father , a man of no reserves , never spoke but with a purpose of expressing his thoughts clearly and fully ; and no man better knew how to express them than he . Though deficient , as I have said , in that cold prudence which takes advantage of circumstances , he was eminently gifted with that more vigorous faculty which makes them . In the piping times of peace , he was a man of no mark . But when society was breaking up from its foundations , he was the man with whom the timid and doubting would seek safety and counsel . Infirmity had now overtaken him , and he could do little more than think and speak . Consulted by all the bold spirits who sought to lift up , from the dust , the soiled and tattered banner of his native State , and spread it to the wind , he never failed to converse freely with such , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he had not imbued them with his opinions , or charged their minds with the arguments by which he was accustomed to support them , he had made them full partakers of his feelings . It seemed , indeed , as if he had a purpose in this . What that purpose was , time would show . One end , at least , it answered . It increased their opinion of his powers , their confidence in his wisdom , and their love for his person . Mrs. Hugh Trevor herself did not hold her husband 's wisdom in more reverence than was cherished by Delia for that of her father . And never did man better deserve the confiding affection of a daughter . He had been her principal instructor from infancy . He had formed her mind ; he had trained her to self-command , and taught her to find her happiness in virtue . Educated at home , her manners were formed in a domestic circle  --  characterized by refinement , and delicate , but frank propriety . Her love of reading had been cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste once formed , her attention had been directed to such as might best qualify her for the duties of woman 's only appropriate station . Herein she had an example in her mother ; a lady of the old school , courteous and gentle , but high-spirited , generous , and full of her husband 's enthusiasm in the cause of his country . Mr. Bernard Trevor was , indeed , a man to be loved passionately , if loved at all ; and to shed the vivid hue of his mind on those of his associates . It was the delight of his wife to , and to cherish , the dutiful affection and ardent admiration of her daughters for their father . The consequence was , that his power over their thoughts , feelings , and inclinations was unbounded . It will be readily believed , that , in the mind of Delia Trevor , thus pre-occupied , there was no room for any very favorable predispositions toward a young man , trained from his boyhood in the service of her country 's oppressors . She had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arch-enemy of her beloved Virginia ; and a sentiment of abhorrence arose in her mind at the words . But she reflected that he was her cousin ; the son of her good uncle ; the brother of her dearest friend ; and , trying to remember his fondness for her when a child , she chided down the feeling of disgust , as unnatural and wicked . But , after all this discipline of her own mind , she found it impossible to think of him with complacency , or to anticipate his arrival with pleasure . Her imagination always painted him in the hateful dress , which she had been taught to regard as the badge of slavery  --  the livery of a tyrant . She would try to love him , as a kinsman , but she never could like him or respect him . At length he made his appearance , and , to her great relief , in the plain attire of a citizen . He was a handsome youth , whose native grace had been improved by his military education , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elegance of an accomplished gentleman . Whether he had been admonished by his father to respect the feelings of his fair cousin , or had caught his reserve , on the subject of politics , by contagion , she had no means of knowing . Certain it is , that , on that subject , he was uniformly silent , and Delia soon learned to converse with him on other topics , without dreading an allusion to that . She thus saw him as he was , and , by degrees , lost the prejudice which , for a time , blinded her to any merit he might possess . And he did possess great merit . A high sense of honor , strict principles , great openness , and generosity , were united in him with talents of no common order . Quick , apprehensive , and clear in his perceptions , there was a boldness , vividness , and distinctness in his thoughts and language , that continually reminded her of him she most loved and honored . Of her father he frequently spoke with great veneration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of his uncle 's precepts . He frequently quoted them as of high authority with him ; and it was plain to see , that , cherished during fourteen years , they had exercised a decided influence in the formation of his character . Indeed , it might be doubted whether his imagination had ever dismissed the idea , which had first disposed him to lend a willing ear to the suggestions of his uncle . That which was sport to the elder members of the family , had seemed to him , at the time , a serious business . The thought that the little girl , who loved to hang on his neck and kiss him , might one day be his wife , had certainly taken possession of his boyish mind . How long he had consciously retained it could not be known ; but the traces of it were still there , and were certainly not obliterated by the change which time had wrought in his cousin . Of her personal appearance I have said nothing . Were I writing a novel , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact account of Delia 's whole exterior . Her person , her countenance , her hair , her eyes , her complexion , should all be described , and the whole summed up in a tout ensemble of surpassing beauty . But , in this true history , I am unfortunately bound down by facts , and I lament , that to the best of my recollection , I shall not have occasion to speak of a single female , in the progress of my narrative , whose beauty can be made a theme of just praise . I do sincerely lament this ; for such is the constitution of human nature , that female beauty influences the heart and mind of man , even by report . We read , in Oriental tales , of great princes deeply enamored of descriptions . The grey eyes of Queen Elizabeth have always made her unpopular with the youthful reader ; and the beauty of Mary of Scotland , three hundred years after the worms have eaten her , still continues to gild her history and gloss over her crimes . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delia Trevor , as that she was good and intelligent , reminding the reader of the sage adage of Mrs. Dorothy Primrose , to wit : " Handsome is , that handsome does . " I can only add , that , when I saw her afterwards hanging on the arm of Douglas , and looking up in his face with all the deep and heartfelt devotion of a woman 's love , I saw enough of the constituents of beauty to make her an object of love , and enough of the soul of truth and tenderness to make her seem transcendently beautiful in the eyes of a lover . I say this , to account for the fact that her cousin Douglas soon found himself taking great pleasure in her society , and anxious to please her , not more from duty than inclination . He was , perhaps , chiefly attracted by her conversation , which was always cheerful , sprightly , and intelligent . He may have yielded to a spell of hardly less magic than that of beauty ; the spell of a voice melodious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones unconsciously with every change and grade of thought or feeling . It may have been the effect of what Byron would call " blind contact , " and , the sage Mrs. Broadhurst " propinquity ; " or it may have been that his hour was come . If one in ten of my married friends can tell exactly how he came to fall in love with his wife , I shall hold myself bound to inquire farther into this matter . But I do not mean to intimate that Lieutenant Trevor , turning his back on the belles of Boston and New York , and Philadelphia , and Baltimore , and Washington , came home , and tumbled forthwith into love with a plain country girl , just because she was his cousin , and he had loved her when a child . I do not mean to say he was in love with her at all . He had a sincere affection for her ; he liked her conversation ; he admired her talents much , and her virtues more . He liked very much to be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What came of this , the reader shall be told when we have disposed of some matters of higher concernment . CHAPTER VII . Nero fiddled while Rome was burning . Douglas Trevor reached his father 's house just after the Virginia Legislature had assembled . The presidential election was just over , and the partisans of Van Buren , exulting in their success , made their leader the more hateful to his opponents by the insolence of their triumph . Though he had lost the vote of Virginia , it will be remembered that he still commanded a majority in the Legislature , elected before the revolution in public sentiment was complete . The more recent expression of public sentiment showed that the time was come when power must be held by means far different from those by which it had been acquired . Opinion , which at first had been in their favor , was now against them . Corruption had for a time supplied the place ; but the fund of corruption was all insufficient to buy off the important interests which were now roused to defend themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to bring to its aid the arm of force , was all that remained . To organize measures for this purpose , and to enrich themselves from the profuse disbursement of public money , which formed a part of the plan of operations , were the great objects which engaged the minds of the majority in the Virginia Legislature . But these , important as they were , could not entirely wean them from those indulgences which , for many years , had made Richmond , during the winter season , the scene of so much revel and debauchery . To these , as well as to personal intrigues and the great interests of the faction , much time was given . But the necessity of attending especially to the latter was made daily more apparent by the startling intelligence which every mail brought from the South and Southwest . The nearly simultaneous secession of the States in that quarter , and the measures to be taken for the formation of a southern confederacy , were things which had been talked of until they were no longer dreaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate co-operation of Virginia , if left to act freely , was now sure . I have already spoken of those men , in each of the southern States , of cool heads , long views , and stout hearts , who , watching the progress of events , had clearly seen the point to which they tended . It is not here that their names and deeds are to be registered . They are already recorded in history , and blazoned on the tomb of that hateful tyranny which they overthrew . They had been discarded from the service of the people , so long as the popularity of the President had blinded the multitude to his usurpations . The oppressions of the northern faction , and the fierce assaults of rapacity and fanaticism , hounded on by ambition to the destruction of the South , had restored them to public favor . They had seen that secession must come , and that , come when it might , their influence would be proportioned to their past disgraces . Presuming on this , they had consulted much together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern confederacy , but they had taken measures to regulate their relations with foreign powers . One of their number , travelling abroad , had been instructed to prepare the way for the negotiation of a commercial treaty with Great Britain . One of the first acts of the new confederacy was to invest him publicly with the diplomatic character , and it was at once understood that commercial arrangements would be made , the value of which would secure to the infant League all the advantages of an alliance with that powerful nation . The designation of a gentleman , as minister , who had so long , without any ostensible motive , resided near the Court of St. James , left no doubt that all things had been already arranged . The treaty soon after promulgated , therefore , surprised nobody , except indeed that some of its details were too obviously beneficial to both parties to have been expected . Not only in war , but in peace , do nations seem to think it less important to do good to themselves than to do harm to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has restored to the South the full benefit of its natural advantages , and made it once more the most flourishing and prosperous country on earth ; which has multiplied the manufactories of Great Britain , and increased her revenue by an increase of consumption and resources , even while some branches of revenue were cut off ; and which , at the same time , has broken the power of her envious rival in the North , and put an end for ever to that artificial prosperity engendered by the oppression and plunder of the southern States ; is such an anomaly in modern diplomacy , that the rulers at Richmond , or even at Washington , might well have been surprised at it . But the bare nomination of the plenipotentiary was enough to leave no doubt that a treaty was ready for promulgation , and that its terms must be such as to secure the co-operation of Great Britain . But , while the leaders of the ruling faction thought of these things , and anxiously consulted for the preservation of their power , there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men who think of nothing but the enjoyment of the present moment . Such men are often like sailors in a storm , who , becoming desperate , break into the spirit room , and drink the more eagerly because they drink for the last time . When the devil 's " time is short , he has great wrath ; " and this point in his character he always displays , whether he exhibits himself in the form of cruelty , rapacity , or debauchery . The amusements , therefore , of the legislators assembled at Richmond suffered little interruption , and the dinner and the galas , the ball and the theatre , and the gaming-table , with revel , dissipation , and extravagance , consumed the time of the servants of the country , and swallowed up the wasted plunder of the treasury . Respected by all , beloved by individuals of both parties , and courted by that to which he was supposed to belong , Mr. Hugh Trevor was an object of the most flattering attention . His house was the favorite resort of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accomplished son was the glass before which aspirants for court favor dressed themselves . The budding youth of his daughter had , for years , been watched with impatient anticipation of the time when her hand might be seized as the passport to present wealth and future honor . Her Delia was not recommended to notice by all these considerations ; but the most prevailing of the whole was one that made her claims to attention fully equal to those of Virginia . Her father , though in comparatively humble circumstances , could give with his daughter a handsomer dowry than the elder and wealthier brother could afford with his . He was notorious for generosity , and his infirmities made it probable that he was not long for this world . Delia was therefore universally regarded as an heiress . Add to this , that in the affection of her uncle she seemed hardly to be postponed to his own daughter , and it was obvious to anticipate that the same influence which had procured office and emolument for himself and his sons , would be readily exerted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever were the amusements of the day , whether ball or theatre , or party of pleasure by land or by water , the presence of Delia and Virginia was eagerly sought . The latter , simple and artless , saw in all who approached her the friends of her father . If she thought at all of political differences , it was only to recognize in most of them the adherents of the man to whose fortunes he had so long attached himself , and in whose fortunes he had flourished . To all , her welcome was alike cordial and her smile always bright . With Delia , the case was far different . Much more conversant than her cousin with the politics of the day , she was aware that her father was obnoxious to many that she met . On some of those who sought her favor , she knew that he looked with detestation and scorn . To such she was as cold and repulsive as a real lady can ever permit herself to be to one who approaches her as a gentleman in genteel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , have countenanced in such cases that sort of negative insolence , the practice of which is regarded as the most decisive indication of high breeding . But she had been trained in a different school . She had been taught that , in society , self-respect is the first duty of woman ; and that the only inviolable safe-guard for that , is a care never to offend the self-respect of others . Thus , while a part of those who approached her , were made to feel that their attentions were not acceptable , she never afforded them occasion to complain of any want of courtesy on her part . Without being rebuffed , they felt themselves constrained to stand aloof . There was nothing of which they could complain ; no pretext for resentment  --  no opening for sarcasm  --  no material for scandal . But in proportion to the impotence of malice , so is the malignity of its hoarded venom . All were aware of the political opinions and connexions of Mr. Bernard Trevor ; and it was easy to make remarks in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her feelings . To this purpose , no allusion to him was necessary . It was enough to speak injuriously of those whom she knew to be his friends , and whose public characters made them legitimate subjects of applause or censure . By this , and other means of the like character , she was always open to annoyance ; and to such means the dastard insolence of those whom her coldness had repelled , habitually resorted for revenge . On such occasions she frequently found that her cousin Douglas came to her aid . Unrestrained by the considerations that imposed silence on her , he was always ready to speak on behalf of the party attacked . If he could not directly vindicate , he would palliate or excuse . If even this were inconsistent with his own opinions , he would take occasion to speak approvingly of the talents or private worth of those who were assailed . Whether she regarded this as a proof of good breeding , or of kindness to herself , or of an incipient change in his opinions , such conduct always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in logic , a great critic , Profoundly skilled in analytic . He could distinguish and divide A hair , ' twixt south and southwest side . Hudibras . Among those who had thus manifested a disposition to win the favor of Delia Trevor , was a young man who had , not long since , entered public life under the auspices of a father , who , fifteen years before , had openly bartered his principles for office . Besides some talent , the son possessed the yet higher merit , in the eyes of his superiors , of devotion to his party and its leader . He never permitted himself to be restrained , by any regard to time or place , from making his zeal conspicuous . Taught , from his infancy , that the true way to recommend his pretensiens was to rate them highly himself , he seemed determined never to exchange his place in the Legislature for any in the gift of the Court , unless some distinguished station should be offered to his acceptance . For any such , in any department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , he supposed that a private intimation to this effect , through his father , would be all sufficient . But he was overlooked , and post after post , that he would gladly have accepted , was conferred on others . Fearful that he might be deemed deficient in zeal , he redoubled his diligence , and with increased eagerness sought every opportunity to display his talents and his ardor in the service of his master . Still he seemed no nearer to his object . Whether it was thought that he was most serviceable in his actual station , or that the wily President deemed it a needless waste of patronage to buy what was his by hereditary title and gratuitous devotion , it is hard to say . The gentleman sometimes seemed on the point of becoming malcontent ; but his father , who had trained him in the school of Sir Pertinax McSycophant , convinced him that more was to be got by " booing , " and resolute subserviency and flattery of the great , than in any other way . Under such impressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send up his incense in clouds . Again disappointed , and sickening into the moroseness of hope deferred , he would become moody and reserved , as if watching for an opportunity of profitable defection . Such an opportunity , at such a moment , had seemed to present itself in his acquaintance with Delin Trevor . A connection with her seemed exactly suited to his interested and ambidextrous policy . A handsome and amiable girl were items in the account of secondary consideration . But her fortune was not to be overlooked . Then , should his services , at length , seem like to meet their long deserved reward , she could be presented at court as the niece of Mr. Hugh Trevor , the tried and cherished friend of the President . Should the cold ingratitude of his superiors at length drive him into the opposition for advancement , he was sure of being well received as the son-in-law of a patriot so devoted as Mr. Bernard Trevor . Utrinque paratus , could he secure the hand of Delia , he felt sure that he must win , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view of the subject , and examined it in all its bearings , he made up to Delia with a directness which startled , and a confidence that offended her . But the gentleman had little to recommend him to the favor of the fair . His person was awkward , and disfigured by a mortal stoop . His features , at once diminutive and irregular , were either shrouded with an expression of solemn importance , or set off by a smile of yet more offensive self-complacency . His manners bore the same general character of conceit , alternately pert and grave ; and his conversation wavered between resolute , though abortive , attempts at wit , and a sort of chopt logic , elaborately employed in proving , by incontestible arguments , what nobody ever pretended to deny . He had been taught , by his learned and astute father , to lay his foundations so deep that his arguments and the patience of his hearers were apt to be exhausted by the time he got back to the surface of things . Yet he reasoned with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the premises from which other men commonly begin to reason . This talent , and this use of it , are more applauded by the world than one would think . Men like to be confirmed in their opinions ; and , the fewer and more simple these may be , the more grateful are they for any thing that looks like a demonstration of their truth . To a man whose knowledge of arithmetic only extends to the profound maxim " that two and two make four , " how gratifying to find a distinguished man condescending to prove it by elaborate argument ! But ladies have little taste for these things , and still less for the harsh dogmatism and fierce denunciations of hostile , but absent politicians , with which Mr. P. Baker , the younger , occasionally varied his discourse . To Delia , therefore , the gentleman , in and of himself , and apart from all extrinsic considerations , was absolutely disagreeable . His first advances drove her within the safe defences of female pride and reserve . But when the manifest audacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supple slave of power , as one who had prostituted himself to the service of his master , with an eagerness which condemned his zeal to be its own reward , her disgust increased to loathing , and her pride was kindled into resentment . Without showing more of these feelings than became her , she showed enough to make her the object of his insolent and malignant hatred . But she was fortified by her position in a family which he dared not offend , and his paltry malice found vent in such allusions to the politics of the day as he knew must wound her . Things were about coming to this pass , when Douglas Trevor arrived . The first time he met Mr. Baker in company with his cousin , he saw a disposition on his part to pay attentions which were obviously annoying to her . Both duty and inclination impelled him to come to her relief ; and , in doing this , he awakened the jealousy and incurred the displeasure of the gentleman . But these were feelings he had no mind to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of a man so influential at Washington as Mr. Hugh Trevor . He accordingly drew off , in morose discomfiture , and Delia , relieved from his offensive attentions , felt that she owed her deliverance to her cousin . He was , of course , bound to occupy the place at her side from which he had driven Baker ; and she was bound to requite the service by making the duty he had imposed on himself as little irksome as possible . She exerted herself to be agreeable , and succeeded so well , that Douglas went to bed that night in the firm belief that he had never passed a more pleasant evening , or seen a girl of more charming manners than Delia . This circumstance led to a sort of tacit convention , which established him in the character of her special attendant , in all parties where Mr. Baker made his appearance . By an easy progress , this engagement was extended to all societies and all places . He knows little of human nature who needs to be told the natural consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form his own judgment , and to anticipate such result as he may , my present business is with the repulsed and irritated Baker . Though it consoled his pride and self-love to impute his discomfitures , not to any absolute dislike of himself , but to a preference for another , there was nothing in that preference to soothe his resentment . As Douglas had , in the first instance , come somewhat cavalierly between him and the object of his wishes , he , perhaps , had reasonable grounds of displeasure against him . But , as it might be quite inconvenient to give vent to his feelings in that direction , they were carefully repressed . In such assaults on those of the lady , as her cousin might not observe , or might think it unwise to notice , did his malice indulge itself . So matters stood when the astounding intelligence reached Richmond , that a diplomatic agent from the State of South Carolina had been long secretly entertained at the Court of St. James , and that he was supposed to have negotiated an informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confederacy then forming in the South . Something was rumored as to the terms of the contemplated treaty , which filled the whole northern faction in Virginia with consternation . It was feared that that State could not be withheld from joining the Southern League , except by force , and that , in a contest of force , she would be backed , not only by the southern States , but by the power of Great Britain . CHAPTER IX . " If I had known he had been so cunning of fence , I 'd have seen him damned ere I had fought with him . " Old Play . It was now the month of February ; and a pleasant day had tempted our young people to a jaunt of amusement to the head of the falls . Mr. Baker , stealing away from his duties as a legislator , was one of the party . Repulsed by Delia , he was beginning an attempt on the heart of Virginia , of whose loyalty , as the daughter of Mr. Hugh Trevor , he could entertain no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other , had not Virginia been held in check by a respect for the supposed opinions of her father . Born at the very moment when the good old gentleman was in the act of making up his mind to sacrifice the sovereignty of his native State to the necessity of preserving the Union , he seemed to seize on the opportunity of compensating the impiety to which he felt himself driven , by giving to his infant daughter the name he had so long cherished and honored . It was a moment of one of those relentings of the heart , in which nature asserts her supremacy , and compels its homage to those whom we have been accustomed to reverence and obey . If even the prodigal or the traitor be subject to be so affected , how much stronger must be such an impulse in the mind of a pure and upright man , impelled by a sense of duty to his country to dishonor her venerated name . This poor tribute was as the kiss of peace with which the executioner implores the pardon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bleed under his hand . Had he yielded to his feelings , he would have taken up the self-accusing lamentation of the returning prodigal . But his sense of duty was deep and abiding , and was always most sure to command his exact obedience when the duty was most painful . He could not doubt the correctness of a conviction , which even his cherished devotion to his native State could not make him shake off entirely . In such a case , to doubt was , with him , to be convinced . But the name thus bestowed upon his daughter was not without an effect on her mind . She knew little of politics , but , from her very infancy , self-love had made her jealous of the honor of the State whose name she bore . The name itself was a spell of power on the heart of Delia . It had disposed her to love her cousin before she knew her . It had drawn them together on their first acquaintance , and had often been the theme of conversation between them . Somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delia had , unwittingly , exercised an influence over the mind of Virginia which inclined her to listen favorably to all that could be urged against the usurper 's claim to a dominion , unchecked by the authority of the State . For more than a year past , Mr. Trevor had himself begun to doubt the wisdom of his former opinions . Doubting , he was silent , but he had not been unwilling to subject his daughter to the action of her cousin 's more vigorous mind . For many years , he would as soon have exposed his children to the contagion of the plague , as permit them to visit their uncle . During the last summer he had suffered Arthur and Virginia to spend a month with him ; and he was not sorry to observe that the former came home with deeper thoughts than he chose to express . Of their love and admiration of their uncle neither made any secret . He was not only unlike their father , but so unlike any other man , that he had been a curious study to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , and the vividness with which he expressed them , afforded them constant amusement . He had that faculty of making truth look like truth , in the exhibition of which the young mind so much delights . Then he was so frank , so ardent , and withal so kind , that it was impossible to know and not to love him . After all this , the reader will not be like to partake of the surprise of Mr. Philip Baker , when he found , on shifting his battery , that he was not much more in favor with Virginia Trevor than with her cousin . The consequence was , that whenever he attempted , in company , to attach himself to the immediate party of these young ladies , he was apt to find himself a supernumerary . But , as Virginia had shown no marked dislike to him , his vanity easily adopted the idea that she considered him as the property of Delia . He took some pains to undeceive her , and would have been mortified at her unconcern on the occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her indifference to a man who did but take her as a pis aller . He did not , therefore , at once withdraw himself from their coterie , but continued to hang about , and take his part in conversation , whenever nothing particularly exclusive in the manner of the interlocutors forbade it . He could not come between whispers ; but he could answer any observation that met his ear . Being , as I have said , something between a proser and a declaimer , he thought himself eloquent , and would seize occasions to hold forth to the general edification , in a style intended to dazzle the bystanders . On the day of which we speak , he had been in close attendance on Virginia , until , rather by address than by direct repulse , she had contrived to shake him off . It so happened , that the rest of the company were all paired off , leaving him in the enviable condition of a half pair of shears , when relief appeared in the person of a gentleman just from Richmond . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nic , had staid behind for the mail , and now arrived with the news alluded to in the last chapter . Baker , being disengaged at the moment , was the first to receive the intelligence , and he lost no time in awakening the attention of the company by volleys of oaths and imprecations . While he continued to exercise himself in calling down the vengeance of " the Eternal , " according to the most approved formula of the old court , on those whom he denounced as traitors , the rest listened in amazement , disgust , or alarm , to this boisterous effusion of his rage . At length , as he stopped to take breath , Douglas availed himself of the pause to ask what was the matter . The whole story now came out , and Mr. Baker , having put his audience in possession of his text , went on with his discourse . Unmindful of the presence of the ladies , he vented his wrath in language with which I do not choose to stain my paper . Every man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last twenty years , was condemned , ex cathedra . The dead were especially recommended to the tender mercies of the devil , in whose clutches he supposed them to be ; while the living were indiscriminately devoted to the same doom . Against the person by whom the treaty was said to have been negotiated , his wrath burned most fiercely . In the midst of one of his most savage denunciations of that gentleman , he happened to recollect having heard Delia speak of him as the intimate friend of her father . The thought turned his eye upon her . She was already pale and trembling with emotion , when she caught his insulting glance . In an instant the blood gushed to her face , and tears to her eyes . He saw it , and went on to comprehend in his denunciation all the aiders , abettors , and friends of the traitor , whom in one breath he devoted to the gallows . This was more than Delia could bear , and more than Douglas was disposed to suffer . He had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the effect on her feelings ; he witnessed her increasing emotion , and felt it his duty to come to her relief . He approached Baker , and passing him , as if with no particular design , touched him gently , and said in a low voice : " Such language is improper in this company . " " How so , " exclaimed Baker , aloud . " I hope there is no man here disposed to take the part of a traitor . " Douglas turned , and , biting his lip , said in a tone not loud , but from its distinctness and marked emphasis , audible to all present : " I spoke so as to be heard by none but you , and invited you by a sign to go apart where I might explain my meaning in private . But , as you will have the explanation here , I say , that you know there is no man here disposed to take the part of a traitor . If you had thought there was , sir , I suspect your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand you , sir , " said Baker , reddening . " My meaning is as plain as becomes this presence , " said Douglas , coldly , and again walking away . Baker looked around , and read in every eye that he was expected to follow . He did so , and , joining Douglas , they both walked on together . " I shall be glad to receive a farther explanation , sir , " said he in an agitated tone . " Speak lower , then , " replied Douglas , calmly , slipping his arm within that of Baker ; " and use no gesture . My meaning is this : That he who is regardless of the presence and feelings of a lady , is not apt to overlook those of a man . To make my meaning yet plainer , sir , your language would have been more guarded , had my uncle been represented here , not by a daughter , but by a son . " The quiet tone of Douglas 's voice , the equivocal meaning of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deceive those who looked on , had calmed for a moment the alarm of Baker . He had recovered himself before he was made to perceive what was really meant ; and ere he had time to reflect on his situation , the dangerous temptation of a repartee assailed him . Glancing back at the company , he said : " If I may judge by appearances , sir , you have the right as well as the inclination to assume that character . " Douglas had turned his head , instinctively , as Baker looked back , and saw that they had rounded a point of rock , and were out of sight . In an instant , he disengaged his arm with a push that nearly threw the legislator down the bank , and stepping back , glared upon him with an eye that instantly brought the other to his senses . While he stood blenching and cowering under this fierce glance , Douglas recovered his self-command , and said , with stern calmness : " You had nearly made me forget myself , sir . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore to compose yourself . I will wait here for you , and we will return to the company together . " He seated himself on a rock , and the other obeyed mechanically . How he succeeded in recovering his composure is another affair . He walked on , and on , and fain would he have followed the course of the river to the mountain cave from which it issues , there to hide himself from the consequences of his own folly and impertinence . What would he not have given to recall that last speech ? Until then , he was the party aggrieved . Douglas 's offence against him had not been so gross as to admit of no explanation ; and , to all appearance , an amicable one had been given . The truth might not have come out until he had had time to escape to his constituents ; and before the next session the affair might have been forgotten . But now , Douglas had been insulted , and how he felt , and how he would resent the insult , was awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls became uneasy at the absence of the two young men . They begged some of the gentlemen to go in quest of them , but the request was evaded . At last , they rose from their seats on the rocks , and declared they would themselves go . They accordingly set out , followed by the rest , and in a few yards came to where Douglas was quietly seated on a flat stone , and playing checks with pebbles on the smooth sand . " Where is Mr. Baker ? " exclaimed Virginia , eagerly . " Yonder he goes , " replied Douglas , calmly . " He has a mind for a longer walk than I like ; and I am just waiting for him here . But I must not detain you , girls . His taste for the picturesque will probably be satisfied by the time we get to our horses , and he will soon overtake us . " He said this with an air so careless as to deceive every person present but Delia . But the heart will speak from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she searched his countenance , unconsciously said : " I have redressed you . " Coloring deeply , she strove to hide her emotion ,  --  taking his arm and busying herself at the same time with the adjustment of her veil . In spite of some undefined apprehensions , she was grateful , relieved , and pleased ; and a slight pressure on the arm she held , spoke her feelings perhaps as distinctly as they were understood by herself . Douglas returned the pressure with more energy . The words of Baker yet tingled in his ears ; and while they burned with the insult , the pain was more than soothed by the thoughts they had awakened . Were then the day-dreams of his boyhood to become realities ? He was not , as yet , conscious of any but a cousin 's love for Delia . He could impute no other feeling to her . But should this mutual affection ripen into a more tender sentiment ! With whom could a man pass his days more happily , than with a woman so intelligent , so amiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not love her . But he felt that to love her , and be beloved by her , would be a happy lot . The slight weight she rested on his arm was sweet to him . He wished the pressure was heavier . But she walked on , self-poised , and with a light and steady step over the rugged ground . Was not that step more confident , because she felt that he was there to aid her in case of need ? Even so , she seemed sufficient for herself in the resources of her own mind . Yet had she needed and accepted , and gratefully , though silently , acknowledged his protection . He was happy in having had occasion to protect her . Was not she the happier for it too ? The heart will ask questions . Time gives the answer . CHAPTER X. Section  --  Oh ! speak it not ! Let silence be the tribute of your homage ! The mute respect , that gives not woman 's name To the rude breath , which , trumpeting her praises , Taints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas handed his cousin the following paper : Letter " Mr. Baker begs leave to throw himself on the mercy of Miss Delia Trevor . He confesses his offence against her on Saturday last . He admits , with shame , that he did intend to wound her feelings , and that he has nothing to offer in extenuation of his offence . He does not even presume to ask a pardon , which he acknowledges to be unmerited , and respectfully tenders the only atonement in his power , by assuring Miss Trevor that he will never again , intentionally , offend her by his presence . Signed , Philip Baker . " Section Delia read this curious document in silence , and , on looking up , found that Douglas had left the room . She ran after him , but he was gone , and for a day or two avoided any opportunity for farther explanation . At length she found one , and asked by what means the paper had been procured . " By proper means , my dear coz , " said he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proper ! " exclaimed she , " for me to receive , certainly . But for him to give ! Indeed , I pity any poor wretch who can be so abject . I am glad , at least , I am to see him no more . I should find it hard to behave to him as becomes myself ! " " It would be hard , " said Douglas , " but as you always will behave as becomes yourself , hard though it be , it was right you should be spared the trial . " " This is your doing then ? " said she . " No questions , coz , " replied Douglas . " I must behave as becomes me too . " This put an effectual stop to farther inquiry , and the slight concealment did but deepen Delia 's sense of the service Douglas had rendered her . While she admired the delicacy which , at once , veiled and adorned his chivalrous character ; he , on his part felt greater pleasure at having redressed her wrong , because the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had acted . The ties thus formed in secret , are doubly sacred and doubly sweet . The heart involuntarily classes them with those chaste mysteries which the vulgar eye must not profane . They become the theme of thoughts which sometimes rise up , and kindle the check , and light the eye , and then sink down again and hide themselves deep in the silent breast . But this privacy was destined to be invaded by one person , at least ; and that , the very one from whom Douglas would most anxiously have concealed the whole affair . Yet was there no person to whose tenderness , delicacy , and affection for both parties , it could have been more fitly confided . In short , Mr. Trevor , one day , placed in the hands of his son a letter , in the President 's own hand-writing , of which the following is a copy : Letter - Washington March 3d , 1849 . My dear sir : I hasten to lay before you a piece of information which touches you nearly . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest claims to my confidence , I yet trust it will prove to have originated in mistake . It is said that your son , Lieutenant Trevor , on receiving the news of the late treasonable proceedings of some of the southern States , openly vindicated them ; and that he spoke freely in defence of the principal agent in their most wicked attempt to league themselves with the enemies of their country . It is said , moreover , that , in doing this , he insulted and fastened a quarrel on one , whom I have great reason to esteem for his uniform devotion to the Union . The regular course for such a charge against an officer , holding a commission in the army of the United States , is one which I would not willingly pursue , in the case of the son of one of my earliest and most cherished friends . As Lieutenant Trevor is now at home , on furlough , I address this letter to you , to be laid before him . I have no doubt he will readily give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a new occasion for displaying that regard for you and yours , with which I am , Dear sir , your friend , Martin Van Buren . Section " Can you tell me what this means ? " said the mild old gentleman to his son . " As I remember , " replied Douglas , " the circumstances under which I heard of the events alluded to , I think , I can give a guess at the meaning . It means that my cousin was insulted , in my presence , and that I protected her , as was my duty . " " And how does it happen that I never heard of it ? Who was the person , and what has become of the affair ? " " It has all blown over , " said Douglas , " and I had hardly expected it would ever be spoken of again . Delia alone knew of it from me , as it was ; and what the other party can promise himself from the exposure , I am sure I can not tell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events ; and both as your father and as the friend of the President , it is right that I should know all about it . " " Certainly , sir , " replied Douglas , " you shall know all ; and when you do , I need not explain why I have never told you before . " He left the room , and soon returned with a bundle of papers . From this he handed one to his father , which proved to be a challenge , in the most approved form , from him , the said Douglas Trevor , to Philip Baker , Esq . Then came a proposition to discuss from the other party ; then a flat demand of apology , or the alternative of , what is called , gentlemanly satisfaction ; then an offer to apologize ; then the paper we have already seen ; and then the following : " Philip Baker declares , on his honor , that he meant no offence to Lieutenant Trevor by any words addressed to him on Saturday last ; and that he deeply regrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of Lieutenant Trevor . " " This will do , " said Mr. Trevor . " It only shows that you have acted as became a soldier and a gentleman . These papers show clearly that the quarrel began in an insult to your cousin , which you were bound to resent . This will be perfectly satisfactory to the President . " " Doubtless it would be , " said Douglas , promptly ; " but so much of the affair as implicates my cousin 's name must go no farther . " " But it is that , " replied Mr. Trevor , " which shows the cause of the quarrel . The other papers only show that you fancied an intention to insult where none existed . This would tally too well with what the President has heard . " " Be it so , " answered Douglas , calmly . " If the President is never satisfied till I furnish a paper which is to blend my cousin 's name with a public discussion , he must remain dissatisfied . I can not help it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to make a lady 's name the theme of guard-house wit . " " Bless you , my noble boy , " said the admiring father . " You are right , and there is no help for it . But what shall I say to the President ? " " What you please . The conclusions you draw from what you know , he is welcome to . The facts are with you . " " Certainly , " said Mr. Trevor , after a musing pause ; " certainly he will trust in my general assurance that his information is , to my certain knowledge , erroneous . This will do . It must be sufficient . " " It must do , " said Douglas , " whether it will or no . In the mean time , my dear sir , let me beg that the affair may go no farther , even in the family . Delia alone knows of it , and she only knows as much as may be gathered from that paper , a duplicate of which is her 's by right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , even to her . " And he did say nothing to her ; but Douglas observed , that that night , when she held up her lip for his paternal kiss , the kind old gentleman gave it with more than his usual tenderness . He held her off , parted the hair from her forehead , gazed earnestly and affectionately upon her ; and then , kissing her again , bad God bless her , in a voice choked with emotion . From that moment , she was to him as a daughter . CHAPTER XI . That proud humility  --  that dignified obedience .  --  Burke . The visit of Delia to her uncle now drew to a close , and she prepared for her return home . It was settled that she should be accompanied by Douglas , Arthur , and Virginia , who were to spend a few weeks with her father . On the road , Douglas felt more and more the duty and the privilege of being the protector of his cousin , and , by the time they reached the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as precious as the former was sacred . Some such thought had stolen into his mind while he was yet at home , but that was not the place to mention the subject to her ; and he had determined to impose upon himself the most scrupulous restraint , until he should have restored her honorably to her father 's arms . Two days travel brought them to the residence of Mr. Bernard Trevor , on the banks of the Roanoke . They found him laid up with a fit of the gout , which , while it confined him to the house , produced its usual salutary effect on his general health . At the sight of his daughter and her companions , his pain was , for the moment , forgotten ; and , flinging away his flannels and crutches , he sprung to his feet and caught her in his arms . At the same time , Arthur and Virginia pressed forward for their welcome , which they , in their turn , received . Unfortunately , Mr. Trevor was not the only one who forgot himself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his slumbers on the hearthrug , had recognized his young mistress , and was manifesting his joy at her return with boisterous fondness , when one of his feet saluted the inflamed toe of his master . In an agony , which none but they who have felt it can conceive , the old gentleman sunk into his chair . Here he remained for some minutes , unconscious of every thing but his sufferings , while the soft hand of his daughter replaced and soothed the tortured limb . At length , recovering enough to look around , his eye fell on Douglas , who stood aloof , waiting to be introduced . Some little tag of military foppery , which always clings to the undress of an officer , satisfied Mr. Trevor who he was . Stretching out his hand , he said : " Ah ! Douglas , my dear boy ! How glad I am to see you ! But I ought not to have recognized you , you dog ! standing back there with your hat under your arm , as if waiting your turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I certainly should not have known you , but for the circumstances under which I see you . But what of that ? Was it not yesterday you were sitting on my knee , and hanging about my neck ? Yes , it was yesterday ; though we have both dreamed a great deal since . But dreams must give way to realities ; so let us vote it yesterday , and meet to-day as we parted last night . " This singular accoste had the desired effect , and Douglas felt , at once , as if he had been with his uncle all his life . " You forget , my dear sir , " said he , " that I was intercepted by one whose privilege , I am sure , you would not have me dispute , though he has abused it so cruelly . " " You mean the dog ? " said Mr. Trevor . " Poor old Carlo ! Come to your master , my poor fellow ! No ; your privilege shall never be invaded . We are both past service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you can not understand the nature of a gouty toe , I hope I shall always have heart enough to understand yours . Give me a rough coat , or a black skin , for a true friend ; one that will not grudge any superior advantages that I may possess . Tom , " added he , in a tone of marked gentleness , the fire is low . No , not yourself , old man , " he continued , as the negro whom he addressed moved toward the door ; " not you , my good old friend . Just ring the bell , and let one of those lazy dogs in the kitchen bring in some wood . But why do n't you speak to your master Douglas ? I am sure you remember what cronies you were , when you were teaching him to ride . " " I 'm mighty proud to see you , sir , " said the old man , taking the offered hand of Douglas , with an air of affectionate humility . " But it was not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master 's words , " to speak first . I made sure master Douglas would remember me after a while . " 1 " I do remember you , Tom , " said Douglas , cordially , " and many a time , on parade , have I been thankful to you for teaching me to hold my reins and manage my horse . " You will find it hard , " said Mr. Trevor , gravely , " to convince Tom that you remember him , if you call him by that name . Tom is Delia 's daddy , and Lucia 's , and Arthur 's , and Virginia 's daddy , and so will be to the day of his death . If ever he ceases to be your daddy , too , Douglas , I shall move to reconsider the vote that we just now passed unanimously . " " It is a vice the northern air has blown upon me , " said Douglas , blushing . " I felt the truth of what you said just now , and am not more sure of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by my good old daddy . " Mr. Trevor now requested Tom to see that the horses of the travellers were properly attended to ; and the negro left the room . " What a graceful and gentlemanly old man ! " said Douglas , looking after him . " His manners , " said Mr. Trevor , " are exactly suited to his situation . Their characteristic is proud humility . The opposite is servile sulkiness , of which , I suspect , Douglas , you have seen no little . " " I have seen nothing else , " said Douglas , " among the servants in the North . If the tempers of our negroes were as ferocious , and their feelings as hostile , we should have to cut their throats in selfdefence in six months . " " I am glad , " said Mr. Trevor , " that you have not learned to sacrifice your own experience to the fanciful theories of the Amis de Noirs , at least on this point . The time , I hope , will come when you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all their cant and sophistry on the subject of domestic slavery . You will then bless God that your lot has been cast where the freedom of all , who , in the economy of Providence , are capable of freedom , is rendered practicable by the particular form in which the subordination of those who must be slaves is cast . " " I am not sure , " said Douglas , " that I exactly comprehend you . " " Perhaps not , " replied the uncle . " And that reminds me that I am trespassing on forbidden ground . Just there , the differences of opinion between your father and myself commence ; and from that point they diverge so much , that I do not feel at liberty to speak to his son on certain topics . " " But why not , my dear sir ? You surely can not expect me to think with my father on all subjects ; and you would not have me do so , when you thought him wrong . I do not profess to be deeply studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , I might hope to find my way to the truth . " " There are some subjects , Douglas , " replied Mr. Trevor , with solemnity , " on which it is better to be in error than to differ , totally and conscientiously , from a father . Delia is but a girl ; but should she have come back to me changed in her sentiments ( opinions she can not have ) in regard to certain matters , I should feel that I had been grievously wronged by any one who had wrought the change . I know your father has not done this ; and I must do as I would be done by , and as I am sure I have been done by . " " I can not conceive , " said Douglas , " what sort of subjects those can be , concerning which error in opinion is better than truth , under any circumstances . " " Those , " replied Mr. Trevor , " in which truth would bring duty in conflict with duty . " " Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of my conversion in such cases . I should take that as an infallible proof that doctrines leading to such consequences must be false . " " Your proposed test of truth is so specious , " observed Mr. Trevor , " that I will go so far as to say one word to convince you of its fallacy . If ever I take you in hand , my lad , my first lesson will be to teach you to examine plausibilities closely , and to distrust summary and simple arguments on topics about which men differ . " " Does any one , then , maintain , " asked Douglas , " that two opinions which impose conflicting duties can both be right ? " " I shall not answer that , " answered Mr. Trevor . " You shall answer it yourself . You are a soldier of the United States . Suppose an insurrection . What , in that case , would be your duty ? " " To fight against the rebels , " replied Douglas , promptly . " And , thinking as you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father to be one of those same rebels . " " I see , " said Douglas , after a pause , in which he colored to the tips of his ears ; " I see that you are right . " " In what ? " asked Mr. Trevor . " In maintaining , " he replied , " that two opinions which prescribe conflicting duties , may both be right . " " But I have not said so , " replied Mr. Trevor , smiling . " But you have proved it . " " I am not quite sure of that . Here is another summary and simple looking argument , on a difficult question . My own rule is , distrust and reexamine . " ' He stopped short , while Douglas looked at him with a perplexed and wondering eye . He at length went on : " I shall not break faith with your father by teaching you to think . You have the propositions ; and you see there is fallacy somewhere . Analyse the subject , and find your own result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hungry traveller . Your aunt has some dinner for you by this time , and here is Tom come to tell us so . Come , give me your arm , and help me to the dining room . " " My dear father , " said Delia , " that is my office . " " Both ! both ! my children ! " exclaimed the old man , throwing away his other crutch . " Why , now I am better off than a man with sound limbs . " In the dining-room , Mrs. Trevor awaited them . A hasty greeting was all she had allowed herself on the first arrival of the party ; after which , she betook herself to the duties of housewifery and hospitality . They found her standing at the back of her chair ; and Douglas , as he entered , thought he had rarely seen a more striking figure . She was matronly in her dress and air ; tall , majestic , and graceful in her person ; and with a countenance beaming with frankness , animation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , being much younger than her husband , was still handsome . She extended her hand to Douglas as he entered , and placing him near her , so mingled the courtesy due to a stranger with the cordiality of an old acquaintance , as to make him feel all the comfort and ease of home , without ever losing a sense of that bland influence , which , while it secures decorum , imposes no constraint . " Would you have known me ? " asked the lady . " I can not say I could have identified you , " he replied ; " but I should have recognized you as one I ought to know . " " And your uncle ? " " Not by sight , certainly , " said Douglas . " I remember him too distinctly for that . He is too much altered . But I know him by his manners and conversation . These I never could forget ; and these are the same , and peculiarly his own . I remember how he used to exercise my mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without thinking . " " And has he been at the old game already ? " " O yes ! He has set me to revising and doubting what have seemed to me to be self-evident truths , and proposes to leave me to work out the problem by myself . What conclusion I am to settle in , I can not guess ; but , from present appearances , I shall not be surprised if I go away convinced that I have seven fingers on one hand , and but two on the other ; nine in all . " " He has not touched on politics ? " " O no ! That subject he has tabooed ; and I am truly sorry for it ; for while I never desire to waver in my allegiance to the United States , I am anxious to understand what may become me as a Virginian . If I may judge from what my father says , there is no man from whom I could learn more on that subject than my uncle . " " His lesson would not be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandments on behalf of the State are only second in authority with him to the decalogue ; and they do not lie in as small a compass . But he fears he might teach you some things your father would wish you to unlearn . " " I am not so sure of that , " answered Douglas . " I meant to say that there is no man whose judgment my father holds in higher respect . " " That is something new , " said Mrs. Trevor , coloring , and with a countenance in which there was some expression of wounded pride . I should be glad to be convinced of that . " " Why should you doubt it ? " asked the young man , with surprise . " Because it has not always been so ; and , as I claim a woman 's privilege to admire my husband above all men , I have felt hurt at it . Your uncle thinks so highly of his brother 's wisdom and prudence , that he has always borne to be thought the reverse of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a heretic on account of opinions , of the correctness of which he found it impossible to doubt . " " There may have been something of this , " said Douglas , earnestly ; " but I assure you it is not so now . I do believe one motive with my father for wishing me to make this visit , is his desire that I should hear both sides ; and have the benefit of the sagacity and manly sense which he imputes to my uncle . " " He will have to tell him so plainly , " replied Mrs. Trevor , " before he will open his mouth to you . But I shall be less scrupulous ; and I am in daily expectation of a friend whose frankness will leave you no cause to regret your uncle 's reserve . " " Who is that ? " asked Douglas . " I shall leave you to find out . You will see many here who feel and think with your uncle , and who come to him to compare thoughts and concert measures . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country depend . " " The only man of whom I should predicate that , " replied Douglas , with some quickness , " is one who , I am very sure , never comes here . " " There is a good and an evil principle , " said Mrs. Trevor . " Events alike depend on both . You speak of the one of these  --  I of the other . " Douglas felt his cheek burn at this remark . His aunt , observing it , added : " You see , you will run the risk of adopting dangerous heresies if you encourage us to be too unreserved . But your candor and good sense may be trusted to lead you right , without our guidance . " Douglas felt the truth of the first part of this speech . Whether any thing more than a complimentary turn of expression was meant in the closing words , he did not know . But if the lady intended to express a hope that he might become a convert to the disorganizing notions which he feared were prevalent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her anticipations would ever be realized . He now changed the conversation , and determined to take a second thought before he invited discussions which might mislead him . He found he had to do with active and vigorous minds , against which he might , perhaps , vainly strive to defend himself , even with truth on his side . He resolved , therefore , to yield to the inclination which led him to pass his time with his young friends , and chiefly with Delia . I crave the forbearance of all critics , who have taken their ideas of a Virginia house-servant from Csar Thompson , or any such caricatures , for giving Tom 's own words , and his own pronunciation of them . It is not my fault if there is but little peculiarity in his phraseology . His language was never elegant , and frequently ungrammatical . But he spoke better than the peasantry of most countries , though he said some things that a white man would not say ; perhaps , because he had some feelings to which the white man is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said he was glad to see Douglas , whether he were so or not . Old Tom said he was proud to see him , because he was proud to recognize his former pet in the handsome and graceful youth before him . CHAPTER XII . Section My heart , sweet boy , shall be thy sepulchre ; I 'll bear thee hence , and let them fight that will , For I have murdered where I would not kill . Shakspeare . I should detain the reader with matters not worthy of a place in this grave history , if I descended to the particulars of the intercourse between Douglas Trevor and his charming cousin . It is enough to say , that he found himself , daily , more and more happy in her society ; and was more and more convinced that it was a necessary ingredient in his happiness . It was not long before he concluded that he would not live without her ; and , having told her so , was referred by her to her father . Nothing doubting that his communication would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter to his uncle , and ask his approbation of his suit . To his utter amazement , the old gentleman , assuming an air at once serious and tender , said : " My dear boy , had I the world to choose from , there is no man to whom I would sooner trust my daughter 's happiness . But circumstances forbid your union . I speak advisedly and sadly . I have seen what was passing . I anticipated this communication , and deliberately decided on my answer . " For God 's sake , sir ! " exclaimed Douglas , trembling with impatience , " what do you mean ; and what is your answer ? " " I mean , " said Mr. Trevor , " and my answer is , that circumstances forbid it . " " Surely , " said Douglas , " your objection is not to the nearness of blood . " " I am not addicted to any such exploded superstition , " said Mr. Trevor . " But my daughter must never marry one that wears that dress . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas , " but will change it without hesitation . " " God forbid ! " replied the old gentleman . " I would not have you do so ; and were you so inclined , it would not be in your choice . " " I can resign when I will , and my resignation will certainly be accepted . " " Still you would be a soldier , and you must be a soldier . Peace is not in our choice , and the time is at hand when every man , who can wield a sword , must do so . " " I do not understand you , sir , " said Douglas in amazement . " I am aware you do not . It is time you should . You have now a right to understand me ; and I have a right to be understood by you . We are on the eve of what you will call rebellion . I shall call it a war of right and liberty . I am old and infirm ; but I am not always imprisoned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sustaining , with my sword , a cause that I have always advocated with tongue and pen . It will be bad enough to meet the sons of my brother in arms against my country . That I can not help . But it is in my choice whether I shall thus meet my daughter 's husband . That must never be . " He ceased to speak , and the young man , dizzy with mixed thoughts and feelings , sat gazing at him in mute astonishment . At length , starting up , he was about to leave the room , when the old gentleman held out his hand . Douglas gave his , and his uncle , pressing it cordially , went on : " My son , " said he , " you are the only male of my race in whom I recognize any thing which tells me that the same blood flows in our veins . We can not help the selfishness that disposes us to love those who resemble us even in our faults . It might be better for you not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did not . But I can not . I find it easier to forget that you are not my son , and to love you as if you were . The hope that you may yet be so , is hardly less dear to me than to you . That you will be so , if you outlive the envy ' of those awful events which shall open your eyes , I can hardly doubt . But these things must do their work . The convictions which shall make you throw off the badges of allegiance to him whose sworn foe I am , must come of themselves . While you wear them , I am bound to respect your honor by saying nothing to shake your faith in him , and to his cause . In the mean time , I can but hope for the best . I do hope ; and I invite you to hope . But for the present , hope must be our all . Things must remain as they are until it pleases God so to order events as to make your sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my daughter 's husband , you will owe to her and to her father . " I leave the reader to imagine the consternation of Douglas at this decisive condemnation of his proposed plan of happiness , and at the astounding intelligence that accompanied it . He saw plainly that his uncle spoke not conjecturally , but from certain knowledge ; and he was sure , that under such circumstances , no attachment could tempt Delia to marry him . He did not therefore attempt to continue the discussion of the subject , but left the house and wandered into the fields . The tumult of his mind rendered him incapable of reflection . I shall not attempt to analyze the chaos of his thoughts . But light , not darkness , floated on the surface . The hand of Delia was indeed withheld for a season , but he was not forbidden to hope that it might one day or other be his . Should it even be true that rebellion was awake , and that civil war was at hand , he was not told that fidelity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The strife must end one way or the other , and that being past , he would no longer be condemned to the hard alternative of relinquishing the object of his most ardent wish , or exhibiting the shocking spectacle of a husband warring against the father of his wife . But what was to be done in the mean time ? Should the old gentleman take the field , he must find some other theatre of action , and his father 's influence with the President would readily procure him that indulgence . As to the idea of renouncing what he had been taught to call his allegiance to the Federal Government , and aiding to maintain the dishonored sovereignty of his native State , it did not enter his mind . Yet there was something in its workings that suddenly awakened an undefined interest in the late correspondence between his father and the President . He no sooner thought of this , than his restless wanderings received a definite direction to the neighboring post-office . He there found a letter from his father , containing little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as follows : Letter - Washington March 20 , 1849 . " My dear sir : Your letter has been received , and , to me , is entirely satisfactory . But I regret to inform you that , to those friends whom I feel myself bound to consult , it is not so . Such of them , indeed , as are acquainted with your high character , do not intimate a doubt that a full explanation of the affair would entirely justify your assurance that I have been misinformed . " But they remind me that my information comes from a source entitled to all respect and confidence , and that , by making thus light of it , I may estrange a friend , whom they regard as hardly less valuable and meritorious than him whose feelings I wish to save . They represent , moreover , that the affair is bruited in the army , and that some officers are mal-content at the thought that a charge so serious should be passed over without enquiry , on the bare assurance of a father 's confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should Lieutenant Trevor not demand a court of inquiry , I am fearful I may be constrained , against my wish , to order a court-martial . Need I tell you , my dear sir , how earnestly I deprecate the necessity of a measure , which must so nearly touch one to whose friendship I feel so much indebted , and whose loyalty to the Union and its officers has always been so conspicuous and steady . " I remain , my dear sir , " Your assured friend , " M. V. B. " Section To this copy Mr. Trevor added these words : " The discretion , good sense , and proper feeling you have already manifested in this affair , have been so conspicuous , that I choose rather to trust its future conduct entirely to yourself than to embarrass you by any advice of mine . Yet , there is one person , my dear boy , with whom I would have you to advise . Your uncle has been a soldier in his youth , and is profoundly versed in all matters of military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacious man , who will , at once , see this matter in all its bearings and relations to other subjects . His views are not only , in general , more comprehensive than mine , but I suspect he is , at this moment , aware of considerations which might properly influence you , and which are hidden from me . I know his guarded and delicate reserve , in all his communications with my children , where he apprehends a difference of opinion between himself and me . Tell him that he has my thanks for it ; but that I shall be yet more obliged , if , in this instance , he will cast it aside entirely , and give you the benefit of all his thoughts , as if you were his own son . I fear my last days may be spent in bitter regrets that I myself have not heretofore made more avail of them . " CHAPTER XIII . It is enough to grieve the heart , To think that God 's fair world hath been The footstool of a thing so mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas again reached his uncle 's house . He went immediately to his room , and sent to request a private interview with Mr. Trevor . He was accordingly invited into the little study of the old gentleman , where he commonly sat surrounded by books and papers . On entering the room , he observed an elderly gentleman , whom he had never seen before , pass out at a door communicating with the drawingroom . Douglas now silently handed his father 's letter to his uncle . Mr. Trevor read it attentively , and again and again looked over it , resting his eye on particular passages , as if to possess himself of the full meaning of every expression . The subject was in itself interesting , and quite new to him . But he felt a yet deeper interest in the obscure intimations of a change in his brother 's mind in regard to those matters about which they had so long and so painfully differed . Even if he was mistaken in this , it was consoling to find himself rising in the estimation of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reckless , and inconsiderate , but consulted as a " clear-sighted and sagacious man " in an affair of very great importance . He alone , who has been conscious of being thus undervalued by a friend at once beloved and respected , can estimate the satisfaction which Mr. Trevor felt at that moment . If there was any mixture of alloy with this pleasure , it flowed from self-reproach . He had sometimes found it impossible to repress some little risings of resentment , at finding his judgment habitually disabled by his elder brother . He had indeed been once a little white-headed boy , when the other was a highly intelligent and promising youth . But , at sixty , he was not quite content to be still looked on as a child . Yet , when he remarked the candor of his brother 's language , and the self-abasing sadness of his tone , he was vexed to think that one unkind thought toward him had ever entered his mind . At length , he interrupted this train of thought , to ask of Douglas an explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a detailed account of the scene at the falls , and was permitted to read the correspondence which had grown out of it . " I have heard something of this before , " said Mr. Trevor . " Delia told me all that passed in her presence , and showed me Baker 's palinode , which is rather the most extraordinary document that I ever saw . Why , the dog acknowledges that he actually intended to insult a lady . He might , at least , have had the grace to lie about it . False shame is better than no shame at all . " " He would have been glad to put the matter on that footing , " said Douglas , " could he have got leave to do so . He sent me such a paper as you suppose , but I refused to receive it . His apology to me I knew to be false . It was , therefore , the more satisfactory because the more humiliating . But I sent him word that I would not take any thing to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is his first projet of an apology , and of my rejection of it . Mr. Trevor read them , and then said : " This is well . I knew you had acted handsomely , but how handsomely , I had not conceived of . But let me hear , I pray you , how all this has been tortured into an offence against majesty . " Douglas colored slightly at the word , and handed his uncle a copy of the President 's first letter to his father . He had but to add an account of his subsequent conversation with his father , and Mr. Trevor was in possession of the whole affair . " You see , " said Douglas , " that I am referred to you for advice , and that you are invited to say to me , unreservedly , what you will . " " I do see , " replied Mr. Trevor , " that I have carte blanche , as far as depends on your father . But there are some things I would now say to his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soldier of the United States . I can not , therefore , discard all reserve , but all that he has ever imposed on me , I now shake off . Indeed , I should have done this now , without his permission . You are my son , as well as his . You have shown that you know how to protect my daughter , and have fairly earned a right to protect her through life . Nay , no raptures ; no thanks ! The exercise of this right must be postponed until affairs have taken a different shape from that they bear at present . But , revenons a nos moutons ! " The question is , what you are to do to save this despicable , heartless wretch , from the necessity of offending a wretch even baser than himself , whom even he despises . " " Whom do you mean ? " asked Douglas . " I mean , " replied the other , " the President and the elder Baker , that tame slave of power , that shameless , mercenary pander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and sacrificed the other for office and infamy . " " And is it for such a man , " exclaimed Douglas , " that I am required to make disclosures before a court of inquiry , or a court-martial , which delicacy and self-respect forbid ? Never ! Be the alternative what it may , I shall never consent to it . " " You are right , my son , " said Mr. Trevor , " nor can I relieve you from the difficulty by authorizing the profanation of my daughter 's name , to which such an investigation would lead . My duty on that head is peremptory , not discretionary . If your father were any thing but the perfect gentleman he is , I might suspect that his reference to me was intended to elicit some such suggestion . But I know him better . I infer from his letter more than you discover there ; and I am not sure that the advice which I am most disposed to give , is that which he would be best pleased to see you follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas , anxiously . " Nay , " replied the old gentleman , " when I have made up my mind , you shall know . " " But why not give me your thoughts , " said the youth , " and let us discuss them ? " " Because , circumstanced as you are , we can not properly discuss them . I can but give you my judgment , when I have formed it , and leave you to find out reasons for it . " " My own first thought , " said Douglas , " is to resign . Let us discuss that . " " It was mine too , " said the uncle , " and there is therefore no occasion to discuss it . Though I had not sufficiently matured my opinion to announce it to you , I think I may promise , that if you come to that conclusion , I shall not dissent from it . " " The only difficulty that I see in the way , " said Douglas , " is that an offer to resign is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from inquiry . " " It is so ; and the opinion is so far right , that , when the charge is infamous , resignation doubles the infamy . It is a tacit consent to be infamous , only on condition that one may be safe . " " You state the point with startling force , " said the youth . " And how would you distinguish this case from the one you suppose ? " " By distinguishing the accusation from one of falsehood , peculation , or cowardice . Should you plead guilty to such charges as these , or seek to evade them by resignation , you stand dishonored . But read over the President 's bill of indictment . Now suppose it true that you had entertained and avowed the sentiments there imputed to you , would there be any dishonor in that ? " " Certainly not ; unless my being an officer of the United States would make a difference . " " Should that prevent you from thinking , or take away a freeman 's right to express his thoughts ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some difference ? " " Certainly . Shall I tell you what it is ? Such sentiments would make it your duty ( not to the United States , but to Virginia and to yourself , ) to resign . Now , it is because I have no mind to seduce a soldier from his standard , that I have been careful not to infuse such sentiments into you . If once you lay aside the panoply of the uniform , and throw away the amulet of the commission , I would not ensure you against opinions which you may have to maintain at the hazard of your life . But time presses . Your own suggestion disposes me to speak more promptly and decidedly than I should otherwise have done . I therefore say , tender your resignation . But , if you have no objection , I should like to consult a friend , on whose most hasty opinions I rely more than on the coolest judgment of others . " " If you mean my aunt , " said Douglas , " I know few persons on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She would well deserve your confidence ; but I mean the gentleman who left the room as you entered . He has been her friend for thrity years , and mine for more than half that time . " " But to me , " said Douglas , " he is an utter stranger , and I feel some delicacy in consulting a stranger on such an occasion . " " You forget , " said Mr. Trevor , " that all there is of delicacy in the case touches me as nearly as you . It is not you , a stranger , but I , an intimate friend , who propose to ask his advice . Charge that matter to my account , then , and merely decide for yourself , whether it may not be desirable to have the counsel of one as remarkable for scrupulous delicacy , as for sagacity and resource ? " " There can be but one answer to that question , " replied Douglas , " and I shall therefore gladly take the benefit of his advice . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My respects to Mr. B  --  , " said Mr. Trevor . " Ask him , if he pleases , to walk into this room . " Tom disappeared , and soon returned marshalling in Mr. B  --  . He was a man apparently of sixty years of age , or more , slightly formed , but tall , erect , clean-limbed , and sinewy . His vigor seemed little impaired by time , though his high and strong features made him look at least as old as he was . A light blue eye , clear and sparkling , quick in its glance , but settled and searching in its gaze , was the striking feature of his face . The sun had burned out all traces of his original complexion , and a silver hue had usurped the color of his hair . His whole appearance was imposing , and while it commanded the respect due to the wisdom of age , seemed to claim no pity for its infirmities . To this sentiment , which enters so largely into the composition of that character which the world calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have called him venerable , though no man was held in higher veneration by those who knew him . CHAPTER XIV . I had not loved thee , dear , so much , Loved I not honor more . Lovelace . The frankness and cordiality of his manner , when introduced to Douglas , gave assurance that he took a great interest in the young man ; who felt , on his part , that he was in the presence of a man of no common mould , and that in that man he had found an efficient friend . " And now , Tom , " said Mr. Trevor , " word for coffee and privacy in this room . " Tom bowed and withdrew , and Mr. Trevor , without preface or apology , proceeded to lay the case before his friend . This he did with great of statement , while the other listened with an air which showed that no word was lost on him . Having got through , Mr. Trevor added : " We now wish you to advise what should be done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. B  --  . " Resign immediately ! " " Your reasons ? " asked Mr. Trevor . " There are plenty of them , of which you are aware , " said B  --  , " and with which our young friend shall be made acquainted after resignation  --  not before . But there are others which may be spoken of now . The alternative is a court of inquiry , a court-martial , or resignation . To the two first the same objection applies . Your nephew can not expect any satisfactory result from either , but by the use of means which , I am sure , his delicacy would not permit him to use  --  I mean the public use of a lady 's name . Some people have a taste for that , and in other parts of the world it is all the rage . I thank God that the fashion has not reached us . A woman , exposed to notoriety , learns to bear and then to love it . When she gets to that , she should go North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boardingschool . She is no longer fit to be the wife of a Virginia gentleman . But there is no need to say this . You , Trevor , were your nephew so inclined , would never permit the name of your daughter to be thus profaned . " " I could oppose nothing to it , " said Mr. Trevor , " but my displeasure . And though I might not wish it , could I have a right to be displeased with Douglas for vindicating himself from a charge which has grown out of his gallant defence of her ? Think of the favorable standing of his family ; observe the rapid promotion of his brother ; and consider whether a punctilio of this sort should bind him to renounce prospects so flattering ? " " Were the prospect more flattering than you state it , " said B  --  , " it would not change my opinion . But what prospect is there ? Colonel Trevor is perhaps a favorite at court . So , doubtless , is your brother . But he is not a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he and his will be , at any moment , postponed and sacrificed to the mercenary , who might desert and even mutiny for want of pay . Here is proof it . " Look at the shallow pretext for this proposed court-martial . The President is pleased to say that he believes your brother ; but that there are those who do not . Who are they ? Who can they be ? Who is there , worthy to be accounted among his advisers , that can disbelieve any thing that Hugh Trevor shall assert ? Do n't you see the cheat ? Do n't you see that your brother , whose attachment to the Union , based as it is on principle , may be safely trusted , is to have his feelings wounded to gratify the mortified pride of the elder Baker , and the skulking malice of his son ? You , Mr. Trevor , know better than I do , who are about the President . Is there one among them to whom your father 's word would need the support of other testimony ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or jealousy , that this thought never occurs to him . He is modestly asking himself what right he has to expect credence from those who do not know him . And who are these malcontent officers ? Think you there is one of them who would venture to express his dissatisfaction to you ? No . There is no one malcontent . No one dissatisfied but that son of the horse-leech , whose mouth is ever agape , and never can be filled . " Do look at this letter , " continued B  --  , addressing Mr. Trevor . " How perfectly in character . Not one traversable allegation ( as the lawyers say ) except that of his friendship for your brother . Those friends whom I feel bound to consult ! ' Who are they ? Press him , and I dare say some fellow below contempt , some scullion of the kitchen political or the kitchen gastronomical , may be found to father what it is alleged that these friends have said . His information is from a source entitled to all confidence ! ' Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He charges that too on his friends , though it might not be easy to find a sponsor for that compliment to old Baker . Since the death of his brother pimp Ritchie , I think that sort of thing has gone out of fashion . Hardly less valuable and meritorious than your brother . ' The same authority . On dit , ' they say . ' I think this last On , would be as hard to find as that universal author of mischief , Nobody . " But , when we come to the dissatisfaction of the army , it is worse still . Here is on dit upon on dit . Somebody says that somebody else is dissatisfied ; and such are the gossamer threads , woven into a veil to hide this insult to your brother , and this indignity to your nephew . Take away these , and what remains but a wish to soothe Baker ? And what must be the force of those favorable dispositions to your young friend , which are to be counteracted by such a motive ? By a reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without influence to make his resentment at all formidable . " " Enough ! " said Douglas . " I will send on my resignation by the next mail . " " No , my dear sir , " said B  --  , " do n't yield too readily to my suggestions . " " It was his own suggestion , and already approved by me , " said Mr. Trevor . " Had you dissented , we would have reconsidered the matter . As it is , we are but confirmed in our decision . " " That being the case , " said B  --  , " I have only to say distinctly that the thing admits of no doubt with me . I am not only sure that , in resigning , your nephew will do what best becomes him as a gentleman , but that he will make a fortunate escape from the service of one whose maxim it is to reward none but the mercenary . " " Then go to work , my boy , " said Mr. Trevor . The mail goes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one to your father . I will have them mailed to-night , and you will get an answer in a week . Here are the materials . Write , and we will chat and take our coffee . By the way , Douglas , you have not dined . " " Thank you , my dear uncle , I am too busy to be hungry , " said the youth . " Be it so , " said the old gentleman . " It is not so long since I was young , but that I understand your trim . Starving is better than blood letting , and a full heart needs the one or the other . " When Douglas 's letters were finished , he would gladly have put them into Delia 's hands before he sent them off . But he found , what most men have been surprised to find , that after what had passed in the morning between him and Delia , it was much harder to obtain an interview with her than before . When a young gentleman makes a visit of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects that he has something to say to her that she is impatient to hear , it is amusing to see how many chances will bring them together . Each of them is always happening to have some call to go where the other happens to be ; and , when together , each is apt to be detained in the room by some interesting occupation until the rest of the company have left it . They are continually meeting in passages , and on staircases ; and , in pleasant weather , they are almost sure to stroll into the garden about the same time . But let the decisive word be once spoken , and all is changed . Then , bless us , how we blush ! and how we glide through half-open doors , and slip away , around corners ! Still it will happen , as love makes people restless , that both will rise early , and so meet in the parlor before others are awake . And then there is " the dewy eve and rising moon , " and the quiet walk " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a private word in the bustling hours of the day , that is out of the question . All this is the result of sheer accident . See how innocent and artless she looks ! And how light and elastic is her step as she moves along ; her swan-like neck outstretched , her face slightly upturned , her eye swimming in light , and looking as if the veil of futurity were raised before her , and all the gay visions of hope stood disclosed in bright reality . Is she not beautiful ? O the charm of mutual love ! Who can wonder that each man 's mistress , wearing this Cytherean zone , is in his eyes the Queen of Beauty herself ? But I forget myself . What place for thoughts like these in a chronicle of wars and revolutions ? True , it is in such causes that the spring of great events is found . But these belong to the history of man in all ages , in all countries , under all circumstances . It was so " before Helen ; " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be unprofitable to look into the chain of cause and consequence , and to trace the deliverance of Virginia from thraldom , and the defeat of the usurper 's well-laid plans , to the impertinent speech of one of his minions to a country girl , during a pic nic party at the falls of James river . But to return . Douglas took a copy of his letter of resignation , and , meeting Delia the next morning , put it into her hands . She read it with a grave and thoughtful countenance , and then , looking sadly in his face , said : " This is what I feared . " " What you feared ! " replied he , in amazement . " Can you then wish me to retain my place in the army ? " " Until you resign it to conviction and a sense of duty , certainly ! " " And can you doubt that I have done so ? " " How can it be so ? " she replied . " But yesterday we spoke on this subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that my noble father has imposed dishonorable conditions ; and that you have been weak enough to comply with them ? O ! Douglas ! Is my love fated to destroy the very qualities that engaged it ? " " Dear Delia , " said Douglas , " I understand you now . Your beautiful indignation reminds me that you do not know what has passed . " " What can have passed ? " asked she , with earnest and reproachful sadness . " All the eloquence and address of Mr. B  --  himself could not have convinced your unbiassed mind in two hours ' conversation . I know his power . I know the wonders he has wrought ; and I trembled when I heard the watchword , " coffee and privacy . " I feared your love for me might be used to sway your judgment , and hoped to have found an opportunity to invoke it for the worthier purpose of guarding your honor . I did not dream that , when I rose so early this morning , I was already too late . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , " said Douglas , playfully . " Your indignation is so eloquent , that , cruel as it is , I would not interrupt you to undeceive you . Your father and Mr. B  --  have made no attack on my opinions or allegiance , and what was done last night you have had no agency in , since our party at the Falls . It all originated there . " He now gave her the full history of the affair , and succeeded in convincing her that his standard of honor was even higher than she had imagined . If she requited him for her unjust suspicions with a kiss , he never told of it . Perhaps she did . For although , according to the refinements of the Yankees , kissing was in very bad taste , yet the northern regime had not reached the banks of the Roanoke . The ladies there continued still to walk in the steps of their chaste mothers  --  safe in that high sense of honor which protects at once from pollution and suspicion . It is true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fastidious , and invent safeguards to prevent vice , and blinds to conceal it when it is to be indulged . Duennas are necessary in Spain . They are at once the guarantee of a lady 's honor , and the safe instruments of her pleasures . Black eunuchs perform the same functions in Turkey . In the northern factories , boys and girls are not permitted to work together . In their churches , the gentlemen and ladies do not sit in the same pew . What a pitch of refinement ! Sterne 's story of the Abbe in the theatre at Paris affords the only parallel . Thank God ! the frame of our society has kept us free from the cause and its consequences . Whatever corruption there may be among us is restrained to a particular class , instead of diffusing itself by continuous contact through all grades and ranks . If it were true , as the wise and eloquent , and pious , and benevolent , and discrect Dr. Channing had said , some fifteen years before , that below a certain line all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was pure . Nature had marked the line , and established there a boundary which the gangrene of the social body could never pass . CHAPTER XV . Section Mammon , the least erected spirit , that fell From heaven , for e'en in heav'n his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent , admiring more The riches of heav'n 's pavement , trodden gold , Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed In vision beatific . Milton . On the evening of the third day from that of which I have just been speaking , the President of the United States was sitting alone in a small room in his palace , which , in conformity to the nomenclature of foreign courts , it had become the fashion to call his closet . The furniture of this little apartment was characterized at once by neatness , taste , and convenience . Without being splendid , it was rich and costly ; and , in its structure and arrangement , adapted to the use of a man , who , devoted to business , yet loved his ease . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commodious variety of chairs , couches , and sofas , while the utmost ingenuity was displayed in the construction of desks , tables , and other conveniences for reading and writing . In the appearance of the distinguished personage , to whose privacy I have introduced the reader , there was a mixture of thought and carelessness very much in character with the implements of business and the appliances for ease and comfort which surrounded him . He occasionally looked at his watch , and at the door , with the countenance of one who expects a visiter ; and then throwing himself against the arm of his sofa , resumed his disengaged air . That something was on his mind was apparent . But , interesting as the subject might be , it did not seem to touch him nearly . His whole manner was that of a man who is somewhat at a loss to know what may be best for others , but finds full consolation in knowing precisely what is best for himself . As the events of the last ten years make it probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignitary of whom I speak , and as few of us are like to have occasion to see him in future , a particular description of his person may not be unacceptable . Though far advanced in life , he was tastily and even daintily dressed , his whole costume being exactly adapted to a diminutive and dapper person , a fair complexion , a light and brilliant blue eye , and a head which might have formed a study for the phrenologist , whether we consider its ample developments or its egg-like baldness . The place of hair was supplied by powder , which his illustrious example had again made fashionable . The revolution in public sentiment which , commencing sixty years ago , had abolished all the privileges of rank and age ; which trained up the young to mock at the infirmities of their fathers , and encouraged the unwashed artificer to elbow the duke from his place of precedence ; this revolution had now completed its cycle . While the sovereignty of numbers was acknowledged , the convenience of the multitude had set the fashions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste of that individual gave law to the general taste . Had he worn a wig , wigs would have been the rage . But as phrenology had taught him to be justly proud of his high and polished forehead , and the intellectual developments of the whole cranium , he eschewed hair in all its forms , and barely screened his naked crown from the air with a light covering of powder . He seemed , too , not wholly unconscious of something worthy of admiration in a foot , the beauty of which was displayed to the best advantage by the tight fit and high finish of his delicate slipper . As he lay back on the sofa , his eye rested complacently on this member , which was stretched out before him , its position shifting , as if unconsciously , into every variety of grace . Returning from thence , his glance rested on his hand , fair , delicate , small , and richly jewelled . It hung carelessly on the arm of the sofa , and the fingers of this , too , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the eye of majesty dwelt with gentle complacency . This complacent reverie was frequently broken by the sound of the door-bell . At such moments , the President would raise his head with a look of awakened expectation , which subsided instantly ; until , by frequent repetition , it called up some expression of displeased impatience . At last , the sound was echoed by a single stroke , which rung from what looked like a clock within the room . He immediately sat erect , assuming an air of dignified and complacent composure , suited to the reception of a respected visiter . The door opened , and the gentleman in waiting bowed into the room a person who well deserves a particular description , and then withdrew . The individual thus introduced was a gentleman whose age could not be much short of seventy . In person he had probably been once nearly six feet high , but time had at once crushed and bowed him to a much shorter stature . Indeed , the stoop of his shoulders , the protrusion of the neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that peculiar complex curvature which brings the top of the cape of the coat exactly against the top of the head . The expression of his countenance was , at once , fawning and consequential . His face had been originally something between round and square . It was now shortened by the loss of his teeth . The muscular fullness of youth had not been replaced by any accession of fat , nor had the skin of his face shrunk , as it often does , on the retiring flesh . The consequence was , that his cheeks hung down in loose pouches , and all his features , originally small and mean , seemed involved in the folds of his shrivelled and puckered skin . His voice was harsh and grating , and the more so from an attempt at suavity in the tones , which produced nothing more than a drawling prolongation of each word . Thus , though he spoke slowly , the stream of sound flowed continually from his lips , reminding the hearer of the never-ending chant of the locust . As the President rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if wishing to prevent the honor thus done him , while the increased curve of his back and the eager humility of his upturned countenance , betokened the prostration of his spirit in the presence of the dispenser of honor and emolument . Having bowed himself on the hand which had been graciously extended to him , he remained standing in the floor as if unmindful of repeated invitations to be seated . The President had not yet so entirely forgotten the manners which once distinguished him as a most accomplished gentleman , and was not at first aware of the necessity of seating himself before his deferential guest . At length , he resumed his place on the sofa , and then the other , with a new prostration , which seemed to apologize for sitting in the presence of majesty , followed his example . He did not , indeed , presume to share the sofa , though invited to do so , but took his place on a seat equally luxurious on the opposite side of the fire-place . But the luxury of the chaise longue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back or arm would be quite unbecoming , and sat as nearly erect as he could , in that precise posture which indicates a readiness to spring to the feet and do the bidding of a superior . " I had begun to despair of seeing you this evening , my dear sir , " said the President , in a tone at once kind and reproachful . " I had given orders that I should be denied to all but you . " " You do me great and undeserved honor , " replied the other , " but I  --  " " I wished to speak to you in private , " continued Mr. Van Buren , not noticing the interruption , " of a matter which deeply interests us both . Here is a letter which I received this morning , which makes it at least doubtful whether the last step which I took in regard to that young man , Trevor , is quite such as should have been taken . " He then took from a bundle of papers , one which he read as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that charges of a serious nature have been made against Lieutenant Trevor , which , it seems , grow out of certain occurrences to which I am privy . I can have little doubt that the affair , to which I allude , has not been truly reported to you . Had it been , you would have seen that Lieutenant T. acted no otherwise than as became a soldier and a gentleman , in whose presence a lady , under his protection , had been insulted . The enclosed documents , to the authenticity of which I beg leave to testify , will place the transaction in its true light . Were Lieutenant T. at Washington , I should not lay these papers before you , without authority from him . As it is , I trust I do no more than my duty by him , and by your Excellency , in furnishing such evidences of the real facts of the case , as may aid you in deciding on the course to be pursued in regard to it . " It may be proper to add , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , these documents were left in my possession in that character . It is this same character , in which I feel it especially my duty to step forward as the guardian of his honor and interests . " Hoping that your Excellency will excuse the freedom which calls your notice to so humble a name , " I have the honor to be , " Your Excellency 's most obedient , " Humble servant , " Edgar Whiting , - Lieut.th Inf . U. S. A. Section Having read this letter aloud , the President , without comment , placed in the hands of his guest a bundle of papers . It is only necessary to tell the reader that they were copies of the same documents which Douglas had laid before his father and uncle , each one duly authenticated by the attestation of Lieutenant Whiting . Mr. Van Buren now threw himself back upon the sofa , and fixed his eye on the face of his companion with an expression which betokened some concern , not unmixed with a slight enjoyment of the perplexity with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uneasiness could hardly have escaped the observation of a casual spectator . He shifted his seat ; he read ; then wiped his spectacles , and read again ; then wiped his brow ; and having gone through all the documents , again took them up in order , and read them all over again . When , at length , he had extracted all their substance , he turned on the President a perplexed and anxious look , and remained silent . At length , the latter spoke . " I fear we have made an unlucky blunder in this business , my dear sir , " said he . " I fear so too , sir , " said the other . " But I beg leave to assure your Excellency that the information I took the liberty to communicate was a simple and exact statement of what I learned from my son , which , I trust , your Excellency will see is in nowise contravened by these documents . I certainly was not apprised of the provocation which , it is here said , was offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Make yourself perfectly easy on that head , my dear sir , " said the President . " I give myself small concern on Lieutenant Trevor 's account . My obligations to his father are more than discharged by the rapid advancement of his elder brother ; and he can have no right to complain that proceedings have been instituted to enquire into a matter which , even thus explained , places his loyalty in no very favorable light . My concern is , lest the prosecution of this investigation should lead to results undersirable to you . " " I understand your Excellency , " replied the honorable Mr. Baker . " The object of this communication is to convey a covert intimation that , if proceedings against Lieutenant Trevor are not staid , he will revenge himself by endeavoring to dishonor my son . I never brought him up to be the butcher of a silk button , ' and do n't wonder that his notions of gallantry , &c.; &c.; do not exactly square with those of these preux chevaliers . " " That view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " and if you regard it in that light , it will remove all difficulty out of the way . " " I can not exactly say , " replied the other , " that I should be quite willing to expose my son to the pain of seeing these documents made public ; concocted , as they manifestly have been , by men who have learned to quarrel by the book , and contrived on purpose to shut the door against enquiry . I dare say he would hardly have made the communication I received , could he have anticipated the step which I deemed it my duty to your Excellency to take in consequence of it . " " The misfortune is , " replied the President , " that I have already caused an intimation to be given to Lieutenant Trevor that it may be necessary to order a court-martial , unless he thinks proper to demand a court of enquiry . Either way , the whole affair must come out . " " Is there no other alternative ? " asked the anxious father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other authentic evidence of the facts . " " Unfortunately , " said the President , to whom habitual intercourse with the base had made the feeling of contempt so familiar that he repressed it without difficulty , " unfortunately these papers are but copies . The originals are doubtless in the hands of Lieutenant Whiting , whose honor can not be questioned , and probably they would be farther verified by the handwriting of your son . " " What then can be done ? " asked the honorable Mr. Baker , in a state of unutterable perplexity . Receiving no answer , he sat musing , with the restless and fidgeting air of a man who seeks in vain for some starting point for his thoughts . He was at length roused from his reverie by two strokes of the bell , which issued from the clock-case at the President 's back . The signal was answered by the touch of a hand-bell , which stood on a table near him . The door opened . The gentleman in waiting entered , advanced to the table , laid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . He took them up , shuffled them through his hands as a whist player runs over his cards , and having fixed his eye on one , took it out of the parcel , and threw the rest on the table . His companion having in the mean time relapsed into unconscious reverie , he opened this , and ran his eye over the contents . " Here is good news for us , my dear sir , " said he . " Lieutenant Trevor here tenders his resignation , which , perhaps , may put an end to the difficulty . " " Perhaps ! " exclaimed the other , eagerly . " There can be no doubt about it , I hope . " " None at all ; if his accounts are all adjusted , of which I have little doubt . But it is not customary to let go our hold on an officer by accepting his resignation , until that matter has been enquired into . " " It will be a great relief to me , " faltered out Mr. Baker , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To have this explained at once , " said Mr. Van Buren , interrupting him . " You shall be gratified , my dear sir . " The hand-bell was again sounded . The gentleman in waiting re-appeared ; a few words were spoken to him in a low tone , and he again withdrew . CHAPTER XVI .  --  His thoughts were low , To vice industrious , but to noble deeds Timorous and slothful . Milton . " There is something in this business , " said the President , after a silence of a few minutes , " which I do not well understand . I was not prepared to find Lieutenant Trevor so ready to resign , and still less to receive his letter of resignation through the hands of his father , without one word of expostulation to his son , or to me . He does not even intimate any the least regret at the event . What can this mean ? " " It does not at all surprise me , " said Mr. Baker . " Hugh Trevor was always a visionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such , that I should consider the manifest defection of Lieutenant Trevor as a sure proof of the estrangement of the father . " " I thought , " said the President , " that he had been always remarkable for his steadiness and fidelity . " " In one sense he is so , " replied Baker . " But his steadiness is of the wrong sort . He is one of those men who professes to be governed , and , I dare say , is governed by principles . But his principles are so numerous , and so hedge him around and beset him on every side , that they have kept him standing still the greater part of his life . When he moves , it would take an expert mathematician to calculate the result of all the compound forces which act upon him , and to decide certainly what course he might take . " " How happens it , then , " asked the President , " that I have always found him so loyal and faithful in his devotion to me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Union , to which he determined to sacrifice every thing else . But now that disunion has come , and the question is whether Virginia shall adhere to the North or join the South , he has a new problem to work , and how he may work it , no man can anticipate . Hence I say he is uncertain . " " But does he think nothing of the advancement of his family ? " " It seems not , in this instance . That is what I meant when I said that his principles were too many . Your Excellency knows , " continued the honorable gentleman , with a contortion of the mouth meant for a smile , and which , but for the loss of his teeth , might have produced a grin , " that the cardinal number of standard principles is the only one which can be counted on . " " Have you then any information , " asked the President , " which leads you to suspect him of disaffection ? " " None , " replied Baker ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not think him capable of that gratitude for the many favors he and his family have received which should bind him indissolubly to your Excellency 's service . " " It is well , at least , " said the President , " that one of his sons , on whom most of those favors have been lavished , is made of different materials . The principles of Colonel Trevor are exactly of the right sort ; or , as you would say , my dear sir , they are of just the right number . Could I obtain any information of the father 's movements , which might give me just cause to doubt him , I would take occasion to show the difference I make between the faithful and the unstable . I would refuse to receive this young man 's resignation , and order a court-martial immediately . I mistake if the father would not be glad to extricate him from the difficulty , by renouncing some of these fantastic notions which he dignifies with the name of principles . " " I beseech your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the virtuous and upright friend of his early youth , in his alarm at the mention of the court-martial ; " I beseech your Excellency not to understand me as preferring any charge against Mr. Hugh Trevor . He is an excellent man , who well deserves all the favors he has received , and will , doubtless , merit many more . I pray that what I have said may not at all influence you to any harsh measures against him or his . " The tact of the President at once detected the revulsion of Baker 's feelings , and the cause . Indeed , he well knew both the men . He was aware that all that had been said of Mr. Trevor was essentially true . He had , therefore , the more highly prized his friendship , as one of the brightest jewels in his crown . He had taught his advocates and minions to point to him as one , whose support it was known would not be given to any man but from a sense of duty . He was himself not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and his favorable dispositions toward Mr. Trevor , and the benefits bestowed on his family , had more of respect and gratitude than commonly mingled in his feelings or actions . Of Baker , he had rightly formed a different estimate . He found him in the shambles , and had bought and used him . To Baker , too , Mr. Trevor appeared only as one , in whose life there was a " daily beauty that made his ugly ; " and he had seen , with malignant envy , the honors and emoluments for which he had toiled through all the drudgery of a partisan , freely bestowed on the unasking and unpretending merit of a rival . Gladly would he have improved the distrust , which he saw had entered into the mind of the President , had he not been warned that the first effect of it might be to press an enquiry which must eventuate in the irreparable dishonor of his own son . While he sat meditating on these things , and subduing his malice to his fears and his interest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound ; the door opened ; and a new character appeared on the stage . No person whose name appears in this history better deserves a particular description than he who now entered . Fortunately , I am saved the necessity of going into it , by having it in my power to refer the reader to a most graphic delineation of his exact prototype in person , mind , manners , and principles . In Oliver Dain , or Oliver le Diable , as he was called , the favorite instrument of the crimes of that remorseless tyrant Louis XI. , he had found his great exemplar . The picture of that worthy , as drawn by Sir Walter Scott , in Quentin Durward , is the most exact likeness of one man ever taken for another . It is not even worth while to change the costume ; for although he did not appear with a barber 's apron girded around his waist , and the basin in his hands , it was impossible to look upon him without seeing that his undoubted talents , and the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be employed in the most abject and menial services . This happy compound of meanness , malignity , treachery , and talent , was welcomed by the President with a nod and smile at once careless and gracious . At the sight of him , Mr. Baker made haste to rise , and bustled forward to meet and salute him with an air , in which , if there was less of servility , there was more of the eagerness of adulation than he had displayed toward the President himself . The earnest enquiries of Mr. Baker after his health , &c.; &c.; were answered with the fawning air of one who feels himself much obliged by the notice of a superior , and he then turned to the President as if waiting his commands . These were communicated by putting into his hands the letters of Mr. Hugh Trevor and his son , which he was requested to read . While he read , the President , turning to Mr. Baker , said : " While I thought of ordering a court-martial on the case of Lieutenant Trevor , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into , intending , if any thing were amiss , to make it the subject of a distinct charge . " Then , turning to the other , he added : " You have , I presume , acquainted yourself with the state of the young man 's accounts . " " I have , sir , " was the reply . " They have been all settled punctually . " " Then there is nothing to prevent the acceptance of his resignation ? " " Nothing of that sort , certainly , sir . But has your Excellency observed the date of this letter of his ? You may see that he does not date from his father 's house . I happen to know this place , Truro , to be the residence of that pestilent traitor , his uncle . Now , if the charge be well founded , I submit to your Excellency whether the offender should be permitted to escape prosecution by resigning . If it be not exactly capable of being substantiated , yet his readiness to resign on so slight an intimation renders his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly certain . Might it not then be advisable to retain the hold we have upon him ? The court-martial being once ordered , additional charges might be preferred ; and I much mistake the temper of the country where he is , if he does not furnish matter for additional charges before the month of April passes by . " " Why the month of April ? " asked the President . " Because then the elections come on ; and there is little doubt that exertions will be made to obtain a majority in the Legislature of men disposed to secede , and join the southern confederacy . In that county , in particular , I am well advised that such exertions will be made . A hen-hearted fellow has been put forward as the candidate of the malcontents , who can be easily driven from the canvass by his personal fears . Let the affair once take that shape , and immediately the fantastic notions of what southern men call chivalry , which infest the brain of this old drawcansir , will push him forward as a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excellency 's approbation , I had proposed to carry into effect for accomplishing this result , in the hope of bringing him into collision with the law of treason , and so getting rid at once of a dangerous enemy . Now , if this young man 's resignation be rejected , and a court-martial be ordered , the part he will act in the affair can hardly fail to be such as to make his a ball-cartridge case . " " Your plan is exceedingly well aimed , " said the President , " but on farther reflection , my good friend Mr. Baker is led by feelings of delicacy to wish to withdraw his charges . I am loth to deny any thing to one who merits so much at my hands , but still there are difficulties in the way which will not permit us to pursue that course . The acceptance of this resignation will effectually remove them , and indirectly gratify the wish of Mr. Baker . Now , what do you advise ? " In the act of asking this question , the President shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the motion . He looked up and saw his master 's face averted from Mr. Baker , and thought he read there an intimation that he should press his former objection . This he therefore did , expressing his reluctance to give advice unfavorable to the wishes of one so much respected as Mr. Baker , and highly complimenting the delicacy of his scruples . " But , suppose , " asked the President , " we press the passage of the law authorizing a court to sit here for the trial , by a jury of this District , of offences committed in Virginia . In that case , should our young cock crow too loud , we might find means to cut his comb without a court-martial . " " That Congress will pass such a law can not be doubted , " said the other , " were it not vain to do so , when it seems to be understood that none of the judges would be willing to execute it . I am tired of hearing of constitutional scruples . " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meekly . " But I really do not see the grounds for them in such a case as this . I beg pardon , Judge Baker . I know it is against rule to ask a judge 's opinion out of court . But I beg you to enlighten me so far as to explain to me what are the scruples which the bench are supposed to feel on this subject . I make the enquiry , because I am anxious to accept this young fellow 's resignation , if , in doing so , I shall not lose the means of punishing the offences which there is too much reason to think he medidates . To try him in Virginia would be vain . Indeed , I doubt whether your court could sit there in safety . " " I fear it could not , " replied the Judge , " and have therefore no difficulty in saying , that the necessity of the case should overrule all constitutional scruples . I have no delicacy in answering your Excellency 's question out of court . It is merely an enquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do my duty . I trust it is not doubted that I would ; and should I be honored with your Excellency 's commands in that behalf , I should hold myself bound to execute them . To speak more precisely : should the court be established , and I appointed to preside in it , I should cheerfully do so . " " That then removes all difficulty , " said the President . " The young man 's resignation , therefore , will be accepted , and measures must be taken to distribute troops through the disaffected counties in such numbers as may either control the display of the malcontent spirit at the polls , or invite it to show itself in such a shape as shall bring it within the scope of your authority , and the compass of a halter . " Some desultory conversation now arose on various topics , more and more remote from public affairs . On these Mr. Baker would have been glad to descant , and perhaps to hear the thoughts of the President and his minister . But all his attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually baffled by the address of the former . All this was so managed as to wear out the evening , without giving the gentleman the least reason to suspect that he was in the way , or that the great men who had seemed to admit him to their confidence , placed themselves under the least constaint in his presence . At length he took his leave . CHAPTER XVII . That just habitual scorn , which could contemn Men and their thoughts , ' t was wise to feel . Byron . As the door closed behind him , the countenance of the President relaxed into a smile , indicative of great satisfaction and self-applause , along with an uncontrollable disposition to merriment . The smile soon became a quiet laugh , which increased in violence , without ever becoming loud , until he lay back against the arm of the sofa , and covered his face with his handkerchief . At length , his mirth exhausted itself , and he sat erect , looking at the Minister with the countenance of one about to make some amusing communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained silent . His minion took the hint , and addressing himself to what he supposed to be passing in his master 's mind , said : " I beseech your Excellency to tell me by what sleight , by what tour de main , this hard knot about jurisdiction has been made to slip as easily as a hangman 's noose ? I feared we should have had to cut it with the sword , and behold it unties itself . " " How can you ask such a question ? " said the President , with mock gravity . " Did you not hear the elaborate and lucid argument by which the Judge proved incontestibly that it could not be unconstitutional to do his duty ? The wonder is how they ever contrived to make a difficulty . Surely none who shall ever hear that demonstration can doubt again . " " But may I be permitted to ask by what means such a flood of light has been poured upon his mind ? But yesterday he was dark as the moon in its perihelion . Has the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " said the President . " No new emoluments to him or his ? " " None at all , " was the laughing answer . " No new honors ? " " None ; but the honor of doing additional duty , for the first time in his life , without additional compensation . " " In the name of witchcraft , then , what has wrought upon him ? " " That I shall not tell you , " said the President , still laughing . " That is my secret . That part of my art you shall never know . It is one of the jokes that a man enjoys the better for having it all to himself . I keep it for my own diversion . It is a sort of royal game . You , I am sure , may be satisfied with your share in the sport , having been admitted to hear that argument . It was a lesson in dialectics worth a course at a German university . But come ! There is a time to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you propose on the subject of these Virginia elections ? " " I propose , " said the Minister , " to distribute some five hundred men in certain counties , with the dispositions of which I have made myself acquainted , to preserve order at the elections , as we should say to the uninitiated ; but in plain English , to control them . They will succeed in this , or provoke violence . Either way , we carry our point . We prevail in the elections , or we involve the members elect in a charge of treason . I think we may trust Judge Baker for the rest . The more dangerous of our enemies will thus fall under the edge of the law , and the less efficient , if not left in a minority , will be powerless for want of leaders . " " But the scene of action , " said the President , " is close to the line . The offenders may escape into North Carolina , and from thence keep up a communication with their friends . They may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their great purpose , or they may adjourn to some place of greater security . " " It will certainly be necessary , " said the Minister , " to guard against that , by increasing the number of troops at the seat of government . Besides , if we can but get one day to ourselves , their chance of legislative action may be broken up by adjournment sine die . " " Then , with so many points in the game in our favor , " replied the President , " we have but to play it boldly and we must win . It shall go hard , too , if , in the end , we do not make this superfluous State Legislature , this absurd relic of imperium in imperio , abolish itself . At all events , the course of conduct which they will necessarily pursue , must sink the body in public estimation , and dispose the people to acquiesce in the union of all power in the hands of the Central Government . We can then restore them all the benefits of real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they ought always to have been  --  municipal corporations , exercising such powers as we choose to grant . " Some farther conversation ensued , in which details were settled . A minute was made of the points at which troops should be stationed ; the number of men to be placed at each ; and the corps from which they were to be drawn . It was left to the Minister to fix on proper persons to command each party , and to devise instructions as to the part to be acted . In some places it was proposed simply to awe the elections by the mere presence of the military . In some , to control them by actual or threatened violence . In others , insult was to be used , tumult excited , resistance provoked , and dangerous men drawn in , to commit acts which might be denounced as criminal . Having thus possessed himself of his master 's will , this modern Sejanus withdrew to give necessary orders for effecting it . " The only truly wise man , that I know in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The only one who knows man as he is ; who takes no account of human virtue , but as one form of human weakness . In his enemies , it gives him a power over them which he always knows how to use . In his instruments , he desires none of it . Why can not I profit more by his instruction and example ? Fool that I am ! I will try to practise a lesson . " He rung the bell , and directed that the Minister should be requested to return . He had not yet left the palace , and soon re-appeared . As he entered , the President said : " This young Trevor ! He has talent , has he not ? " " Talent of every kind , " said the Minister . " That he has a superabundance of what fools call honor and gallantry , I happen to know . I suppose his other virtues are in proportion ? " " I suspect so , from the example of the father , and all I can learn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ultimate course ? or even that of his father ? Do you doubt that if the standard of rebellion is once raised , the young man will be found fighting under it , with the old man 's approbation ? " " Not at all . I know no man who would raise it sooner than himself , after he has had time to be thoroughly indoctrinated by his uncle . " " Then the sooner the better . He is but a cockerel yet . What if he can be brought to commit himself before his spurs have acquired their full length ? " " Nothing could be more judicious , and nothing easier . " " How would you go about it ? " " Let him have a letter neither accepting nor rejecting . Intimating the necessity of farther investigation of his accounts , &c.; &c.; before we let him off , and requiring him , for the convenience of farther correspondence , to remain at the place from whence his letter is dated . Keep him fretted in this way until the election is near at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him receive a letter accepting his resignation . My life upon it , he will spring to his destruction like a bow , when the string is cut , that snaps by its own violence . " " You are right , " said the President . " That will do . Much will depend on the style of that letter . You have your hands too full to be troubled with such things , or I should ask you to do what no man can do so well . But you have your pupils , who have learned of you to say what is to be said , so as just to produce the desired effect , and no other . " The instrument of the royal pleasure again withdrew . Again the President looked after him , and said , musingly : " Were I not myself , I would be that man . I should even owe him a higher compliment could one be devised , for , but for him , I had never been what I am . What then ? Is he the creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am wrong . Could he have made himself what I am , he would have done so . He has but fulfilled my destiny , and I his . He has made me what I alone was capable of becoming , and I , in turn , have made him all that he ever can be . I owe him nothing , therefore ; and should he ever be guilty of any thing like virtue , there is nothing to hinder me from lopping off any such superfluous excrescence , even if his head should go with it . But he is in no danger on that score . If he held his life by no other tenure , his immortality would be sure . " While the master thus soliloquized , the minion was wending his way home , to the performance of the various duties assigned him . Our present business is with the letter to Douglas alone . The pen of a ready and skillful writer was employed , the document was prepared , submitted to the inspection of the President , approved by him , signed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mail , and forwarded to Douglas . Let us accompany it . CHAPTER XVIII . Section  --  Behold the tools , The broken tools that tyrants cast away By myriads.  --  Byron . Behold us then , once more , at the door of Mr. Bernard Trevor 's little study . The uncle and nephew are together . A servant enters with letters from the post-office , and we enter with him . The letters are opened , and Douglas having read that of the Secretary of War , hands it to his uncle . Let us read with him . Letter " Sir : I have it in command from his Excellency the President to say , that your letter of resignation has been received with surprise and regret . " He has seen with surprise that , at a moment of such critical importance , one who had been , as it were , the foster-child of the Union , should seize , with apparent eagerness , a pretext to desert the banner of his too partial sovereign . " His regret is not at the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meditating such a step , would , at best , be merely nominal ; but at the thought that that one , is the son of a friend so long cherished and so much respected as your father . " I am farther charged to remind you , that resignation , when resorted to for the purpose of evading military prosecution , is always deemed little short of a confession of guilt . In most cases , this produces no embarrassment . The loss of the commission is generally an adequate punishment ; and it is , in such cases , well to leave the conscience and the fears of the accused to inflict that punishment , ratifying the sentence by prompt acceptance of the proffered resignation . " But this does not hold in all cases . The President bids me say that he is not yet prepared how to act in one of so serious a character as this . His regard for your father is the source of this perplexity . He requires time to reflect how far he can reconcile to his public duty , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirous , if possible , to stay enquiry by accepting your resignation . Under other circumstances , he would not hesitate to reject it , and instantly order a court-martial , as the proper means of bringing to prompt and merited punishment an offence which , I am charged to say , he considers as virtually admitted by your attempt to evade a trial ; when , if innocent , you would certainly wish an investigation , in order to establish your innocence . " In conclusion , I am instructed to say , that for the purpose of farther communication , if necessary , and to facilitate such measures as it may be deemed proper to take in relation to you , I am required to keep myself advised of your locality . To save trouble , therefore , I deem it advisable to command you to remain at the place from whence your letter of resignation was dated , and to which this is directed , until farther orders . " Yours , &c.; &c.; ( " By order of the President . " ) Section This letter Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every phrase and word , while Douglas , perceiving the handwriting of his friend Whiting on the back of another , hastily tore it open , and read as follows : Letter " I never performed a more painful duty in my life , my dear Trevor , than in putting the seal and superscription to the accompanying letter from the Secretary . " My situation in the Department should have given me earlier notice of what was passing , but I got no hint of it until yesterday . I immediately did what I believed to be my duty as a friend ; though I am now fearful that what I did may not meet your entire approbation . I am sensible you would not have done it for yourself ; but there are some things which delicacy forbids us to do in our own case , which we are not displeased to have done by others . Indeed , had I known that the matter had gone so far , I should have left it in your own hands . But I had no reason to believe that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , and I wished to prevent any step whatever from being taken . " With this view I ventured to lay the whole correspondence before the President . I know that he received and read it . You will therefore judge my surprise at being required , to-day , to forward the unprecedented document which accompanies this . " I am guilty of no breach of duty when I assure you that that paper is sent , as it imports on its face , by the order of the President . ' The Secretary is not responsible even for one word of it . The very handwriting is unknown to me , and it was sent to the department precisely in the shape in which you receive it . " Knowing what I did , I should have doubted whether it had not been surreptitiously placed among other papers transmitted to us at the same time . But there is no room for mistake . It came accompanied by the most authentic evidence that it had been read and approved by the President himself . " I find myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of full faith in a charge disproved by my positive assurance : a charge that no one can believe , who does not believe me capable of basely fabricating the documents , copies of which the President has , authenticated under my hand . " Your own course leaves no doubt what you would advise me to do , under such circumstances . But my lot in life is different from yours . Impatient as I am of this indignity , I fear I shall be constrained to bear it . My poverty but not my will consents . " I do not , therefore , ask you to advise me , for I would not do so , unless prepared to give to your advice more weight than I can allow it . It could add nothing to the convictions of my own mind , and the indignant writhings of my own wounded honor ; and even these , God help me , I am forced to resist ! " This affair has , as yet , made no noise . It is not at all known of in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathy of all whose regard you value , and their unabated confidence in your honor and fidelity . I shall make it my business , be the consequence to myself what it may , to do you ample justice . Indeed , my indignation makes me so reckless of consequences , that , apart from the necessity of bearing insult from one from whom no redress can be demanded , I am not sure that I do not envy your lot . " That your resignation will eventually be accepted , can not be doubted . What is the motive to this letter , it is hard to say ; but certainly it does not proceed from such a disposition as would willingly afford you an opportunity of triumphant vindication . " God bless you , my dear Trevor . We have indications that stirring times are at hand , which will tempt me to exchange the pen for the sword . Where duty may call me , I can not anticipate ; but it will be strange if the charms of a life of active service do n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find still and unalterably , your friend , " E. W. " Section Having read this second letter , Douglas passed it also to his uncle , and , rising , hastily left the house . It is needless to scan the thoughts that accompanied him in his ramble . They were bitter and fierce enough . But he had learned , in early life , to master his feelings , and never to venture into the presence of others until the mastery had been established . Many a weary mile did he walk that day before his purpose was accomplished , but having at last effected it , he returned . Mr. Trevor had found leisure , in the mean time , to scrutinize the letters in whole and in detail , and had , at length , arrived at a conclusion not far from the truth . He was prepared , therefore , to welcome the return of Douglas with a cheerful smile ; and instead of adding to his excitement by any expression of resentment or disgust , endeavored to calm and soothe him . For such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncle 's wishes in regard to him , he had looked for something different , and had endeavored to fortify his mind against such impressions as he feared he might attempt to make on it . The great principles by which he had been taught to govern himself were not false because he had been wronged . His duty to the Union was not affected by the injustice of the President . So his father would have reasoned the matter , and like his father , he determined , if possible , to think and act . But he had no idea that in this attempt he would receive countenance and even aid from his uncle . It may , therefore , be readily believed that the old gentleman rose yet higher in his esteem and confidence , from the delicacy and forbearance which he so unexpectedly practised . CHAPTER XIX . Stone walls do not a prison make , Nor iron bars a cage . Lovelace . It was settled , on consultation , that he should abide the final event ; and that , until then , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , to Delia , or to any of the family but Mrs. Trevor . In her he had learned to seek an adviser , and in her he always found one  --  sincere , sagacious , and discreet . Mr. Trevor , as I have said , was not a man from whose opinions his wife would probably dissent , but he had not contented himself to command her blind , unreasoning acquiescence . He had trained her mind ; he had furnished her with materials for thought ; and he had taught her to think . She was in all his confidence , and he consulted with her habitually on plans which involved the welfare of his country . From her , therefore , the history of Douglas 's entanglement with the authorities at Washington was not concealed . From the rest of the family it was a profound secret ; and , as Mr. Trevor 's health was now much restored , it did not interrupt the enjoyments of the genial season which invited them to seek amusement out of doors . By means of this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite easy to accomplish his philosophical determination to wait the result of the affair in patience . When , at length , a week had been allowed him to fret his heart out , the deferred acceptance of his resignation was received . This , too , was couched in phrases of decorous and studied insult . But he had learned to think that the dastard blow struck by one who screens himself behind the authority of office , inflicts no dishonor . The interval , which had been intended to give his passions time to work themselves into a tempest , had subdued them . Reason had taken the ascendant , and , though his reflections had not been much more favorable to the authority of his former master , than the promptings of his resentment , they were much less suited to his present purpose . He was effectually weaned ; divested of all former prepossessions , and ready to yield to the dictates of calm , unbiassed reason . He sought his uncle , and with a quiet and cheerful smile , handed him the letter . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank God ! you are now a freeman . " " I am truly thankful for it , " replied Douglas , " though I feel as if I shall never lose the mark of the collar which reminds me that I have been a slave . But , until within a short time past , I have never felt that I was . " " When the bondage reaches to the mind , " said Mr. Trevor , " it is not felt . " " And was mine enslaved , " asked Douglas , " when my thoughts were as free as air ? " " Their prison was airy , " replied the old gentleman , " and roomy , and splendidly fitted up . But look at the President 's letters , and see the penalties you might have incurred , had your freedom of thought rambled into such opinions as many of your best friends entertain . " " Still , " replied Douglas , " the penalty would have attached , not to the opinion but to the expression of it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in deciding between opinions which it might be unsafe to express , and those which would be regarded as meritorious ? " " I can , at least , assure you that such a thought as that never occurred to me . " " But it occurred to your friends . It tied my tongue , and , I suspect , your father 's too , of late . Now that I am free to speak , let me ask , wherein would have been the criminality of expressing the opinions imputed to you ? " " It would have been inconsistent with my duty of allegiance . " " Allegiance ! To whom ? You will not say to King Martin the First ? To what ? " " To the constitution of the United States . I was bound by oath to support that . " " And what if your views of the constitution had shown you that the acts of the Government were violations of the constitution , and that the men denounced by Baker as traitors were its most steady supporters . What duty would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the constitution by taking part with those who trampled it under foot , against those who upheld it as long as there was hope ? " " I should have distrusted my own judgment . Surely , you would not have me set up that against the opinions of the legislative , executive , and judiciary , all concurrently expressed according to the forms of the constitution . " " What then must I do ? " asked Mr. Trevor . " Be the opinions of all these men what they may , the constitution , after all , is what it is . As such , I am bound to support it . Now , when I have schooled myself into all possible respect for their judgment , and all possible diffidence of my own , if I still think that they are clearly in error , is it by conforming to their opinion or my own that I shall satisfy my own conscience , to which my oath binds me , that I do actually support the constitution ? " " I suppose , " said Douglas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own convictions . " " Then I may , at last , trust my own judgment when I have no longer any doubt . " " You must , of necessity . " " And you , " said Mr. Trevor , " who were not free to do so  --  who , in the matter of an oath , were to be guided , not by your own conscience , but by the consciences of other men  --  was your mind free ? " Douglas colored high , and , after a long pause , said : " I see that I have been swinging in a gilded cage , and mistook its motions for those of my own will . I see it , and again respond cordially to your ejaculation : Thank God ! I am free . " " I rejoice at it , especially , " said Mr. Trevor , " because now all reserve is at an end between us . Heretofore , in all my intercourse with you , my tongue has been tied on the subject of which I think most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hard to speak to a son of Virginia without speaking of her wrongs , and the means of redressing them . It is harder still , when he to whom I speak is my own son too . " " I have long ago learned from my father , " said Douglas , " that the whole South had been much oppressed . I know , too , that he attributes the oppression to the exercise of powers not granted by the constitution . But , with every disposition to resist this oppression , he taught me to bear it sooner than incur the evils of disunion . " " What are they ? " " Weakness , dissention , and the danger to liberty from the standing armies of distinct and rival powers . " " Hence you have never permitted yourself to look narrowly into the question . " " I never have . I have no doubt of our wrongs ; but I have never suffered myself to weigh them against disunion . That I have been taught to regard as the maximum of evil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , whether you shall continue to bear these wrongs , or seek the remedy offered by an invitation to join the Southern Confederacy . The evils of which you speak would certainly not be increased by such a step . We might weaken the North , but not ourselves . As to standing armies , here we have one among us . The motive which that danger presented is now reversed in its operation . While we remain as we are , the standing army is fastened upon us . By the proposed change , we shake it off . Then , as to dissention , if there is no cause of war now , there would be none then . Indeed the only cause would be removed , and it would be seen that both parties had every inducement to peace . Even in the present unnatural condition , you see that the separation having once taken place , there remains nothing to quarrel about . " " What , then , " said Douglas , " is the meaning of all this military array that I see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not at all . They have no such thought . The talk of such things is nothing but a pretext for muzzling Virginia . " " How do you mean ? " asked Douglas . " You will know if you attend the election in this county to-morrow . You will then see that a detachment of troops has been ordered here on the eve of the election . The ostensible use of it , is to aid in the prevention of smuggling , or , in other words , in the enforcement of the odious tariff , and a participation in the advantages our southern neighbors enjoy since they have shaken it off . But you will see this force employed to brow-beat and intimidate the people , and to drive from the polls such as can not be brought to vote in conformity to the will of our rulers . Go back to Richmond next winter , and you will see the force stationed there increased to what will be called an army of observation . In the midst of this , the Legislature will hold its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged as to bridle the disaffected counties , and prevent the people from marching to the relief of their representatives . By one or the other , or both of these operations ; Virginia will be prevented from expressing her will in the only legitimate way , and her sons , who take up arms on her behalf , will be stigmatised as traitors , not only to the United States , but to her . " CHAPTER XX . Ah , villain ! thou wilt betray me , and get a thousand crowns of the King for carrying my head to him .  --  Shakespeare . As Mr. Trevor had intimated , the next day was the day for the election of members to the State Legislature . The old gentleman , in spite of his infirmities , determined to be present . He ordered his barouche , and provided with arms both the servant who drove him , and one who attended on horseback . He armed himself also with pistols and a dirk , and recommended a like precaution to Douglas . " You must go on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more efficiency on an emergency . At all events , were you to drive me , I should have no excuse for taking one whose services I would not willingly dispense with . Give me the world to choose from , and old Tom 's son Jack is the man I would wish to have beside me in the hour of danger . As to you , my son , I think your late master would not be sorry to get you into a scrape . You should , therefore , be on your guard . My infirmities will render your personal aid necessary to help me to the polls . Keep near me , therefore ; but keep cool , and leave me to fight my own battles . Prudence and forbearance are necessary for you . As to me , I have nothing to hazard . The measure of my offences is full already . I have sinned the unpardonable sin , and though there is no name for it in the statute book , I have no doubt if they had me before their new Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baker , would find one . " " Why do you call him my special friend , " asked Douglas . " Because I have means of being advised of what is doing among our rulers , and know that he was at the bottom of the whole proceeding against you . Therefore , I warn you to be prudent to-day . Depend upon it , if you can be taken in a fault , he will find means to feed fat his grudge ' against you . " On reaching the election ground , the stars and stripes were seen floating above the door of the court-house , which was still closed . A military parade was " being enacted " for the amusement of the boys and cake-women , and the uniform showed that the men were regulars in the service of the United States . They were twenty or thirty in number , all completely armed and equipped . As soon as Mr. Trevor appeared , they were dismissed from parade , the door was thrown open , and they rushed into the house . Presently after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Trevor approached the door , Douglas observed that a multitude of persons , who before had been looking on , in silent observance of what was passing , advanced to salute him , and , falling behind him , followed to the court-house . On reaching the door , they found it effectually blocked up by half a dozen soldiers , who stood in and about , as if by accident and inadvertence . But the unaccommodating stiffness with which each maintained his position , left no doubt that they were there by design . They were silent , but their brutish countenances spoke their purpose and feelings . Mr. Trevor might have endeavored in vain to force his passage , had not the weight of the crowd behind pressed him through the door . In this process he was exposed to some suffering , but made no complaint . The effect appeared only in the flush of his cheek , and the twitching of his features . The blood of Douglas began to boil , and , for the first time in his life , the uniform he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the house , they were nearly deafened with the din . It proceeded from quite a small number , but they made amends for their deficiency in this respect , by clamorously shouting their hurras for the President , and his favored candidate . Besides the soldiery , there were present the sheriff , who conducted the election , and some twenty or thirty of the lowest rabble . On the bench were two candidates . The countenance of one of those was flushed with insolent triumph . The other looked pale and agitated . He was placed between his competitor and a subaltern officer of the United States army . He seemed to have been saying something , and at the moment when Mr. Trevor and his party entered , was about to withdraw . Meeting him at the foot of the stair leading down from the bench , that gentleman asked him the meaning of what he saw ; to which he answered that he had been compelled to withdraw . The meeting of these two gentlemen had attracted attention , and curiosity to hear what might pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Trevor took advantage of the temporary silence , and said aloud : " You have been compelled to withdraw . Speak out distinctly , then , and say that you are no longer a candidate . " " Fellow-citizens , " responded the other , in the loudest tones his tremor enabled him to command , " I am no longer a candidate . " " And I am a candidate , " cried Mr. Trevor , in a voice which rang through the house . I am a candidate on behalf of Virginia , her Rights , and her Sovereignty . " The shout from behind the bar , at this annunciation , somewhat daunted the blue coats , and Mr. Trevor was lifted to the bench on the shoulders of his friends ; when the officer was heard to cry out , " Close the polls . " " Place me near that officer , " said Mr. Trevor , in a quiet tone . The sheriff , a worthy but timid man , looked at him imploringly . He was set down by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas , thus addressed him  --  " I shall say nothing , sir , " said he " to the sheriff about his duty . He is the judge of that , and he knows that , without my consent , he has no right to close the polls before sunset . Unless compelled by force , he will not do it . He shall not be compelled by force ; and , if force is used , I shall know whence it comes . Now mark me , sir ; I am determined that this election shall go on , and that peaceably . If force is used , it must be used first on me . Now , sir , my friends are numerous and brave , and well armed , and I warn you that my fall will be the signal of your doom . Not one of your bayonetted crew would leave this house alive . As to you , sir , I keep my eye upon you . You stir not from my side , till the polls are closed . I hold you as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack is made on him , I shall know you for the instigator . And , more than that , sir , I know he is disposed to do his duty , and will not think of closing the polls prematurely . A menace addressed to him may escape my ear . If he offers to do it , if he does but open his mouth to declare that the polls are closed , I blow your brains out on the spot . " Suiting the action to the word , he , at the same moment , showed a pistol , the finish of which gave assurance that it would not miss fire . The officer started back in evident alarm , and made a movement to withdraw ; but he found himself hedged in by brawny countrymen , who closed around him , while every hand was seen to gripe the handle of some concealed weapon . " Be patient , sir , " said Mr. Trevor , " you had no business here ; but , being here , you shall remain . No harm shall be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of your own violence . Offer none . For if you do but lift your hand , or touch your weapons , or utter one word to your myrmidons , you die . " These words were uttered in a tone in which , though loud enough to be heard by all , there was as much of mildness as of firmness . Indeed his last fearful expression was actually spoken as in kindness . The officer seemed to take it so , and quietly seated himself . Not so the rival candidate . He rose , with a great parade of indignation , saying : " Let me pass , at least . This is no place for me . " " Do you mean to leave us , sir , " said Mr. Trevor , with great courtesy . " I do , " said the other . " To what purpose should I remain ? " " Do you then decline ? Are you no longer a candidate ? " " I am ; but I will not remain here beset by armed violence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No ; I leave you to work your will . I have no farther part in the matter . I shall do nothing , and consent to nothing . When the law closes the poll , it will be closed . " Saying this , he withdrew , and Mr. Trevor observed that , as he went out , he spoke aside to the sergeant of the company , who followed him from the house . Soon after , the men , one by one , dropped off , and all at length disappeared . The election now went on peaceably , and nearly every vote was cast for Mr. Trevor . But it did not escape his observation that there were persons present whom he knew to be hostile to him , and devoted to the rulers at Washington , who yet did not vote . He saw the motive of this conduct , but determined to make it manifest to others as well as himself , and to expose the disingenuous and unmanly artifice which he saw his enemies were using against him . Catching the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not voted , I think , Mr. A  --  ? " " I have not , " was the answer , " and I do n't mean to vote . " " I beg that you will , sir , " said Mr. Trevor . " I know you to be my enemy , personal as well as political ; but I sincerely wish the name of every voter in the county to appear on the poll book , though my defeat should be the consequence . " " It may be so , sir , " replied the other ; " but I shall not vote at an election , controlled by force , and where those commissioned by the Government to keep order , are either driven off or detained in durance . " " I do not understand you , sir , " said Mr. Trevor . " Am I to infer that the presence of the military here is under the avowed orders of their master ? " " I dare say , " replied the other , " that Lieutenant Johnson will show you his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will do so , with great pleasure , " said Mr. Trevor , " and promise myself great edification from the perusal . " " I will read them , sir , " said the officer , taking a paper from his pocket , which he read accordingly in the following words : " As there is reason to believe that evil disposed persons design to overawe or disturb the election of members to the Legislature from the county of  --  , Lieutenant Johnson will attend at the day and place of election with the troops under his command , for the purpose of preserving order . Should his authority be opposed , he is , if permitted to do so , to make known that he acts by the command of the President , to the end that all who may be disposed to resist him , may be duly warned that in so doing they resist the authority of the United States , and take heed lest they incur the penalties of the law . " " Why , this is well , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and countenance to a charge of resistance to the authority of the United States , that you , Mr. A  --  , refuse to vote . " " No , sir , " replied A  --  ; " it is because I never will vote at an election controlled by force . " " Be it so , sir , " said Mr. Trevor . " I perceive your drift . Go , then , and tell your master that the means used to vindicate the freedom of election were used to control it . Go , sir , and show that you are as much an enemy to truth and honor as to me . " To this A  --  made no reply , and soon after withdrew . Indeed , hardly any person remained but the friends of Mr. Trevor , and it was obvious that the result of the election was not to be changed by any votes which could be given . The necessity of keeping open the poll till sunset was , nevertheless , imperious . But the scene became dull and irksome . Douglas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By no means , " said he . " You do n't understand this game . Should we disband , the sheriff would be required , at the peril of his life , to make a false return . But he shall have his will . Mr. Sheriff , shall I withdraw also ? " " No ! no ! For God 's sake , stay , sir ! " exclaimed the alarmed sheriff ; " and either see me home , or take me home with you . I have not the influence which makes you safe in the midst of enemies , and am not ashamed to say that I fear my life . " " I will protect you , then , sir , " said Mr. Trevor , " until you have made out your return , and given your certificate . When these are done , I hope you will be safe . " The scene again subsided into its former dullness . The enemy had disappeared , with the exception of the captive officer , who looked on ruefully , while an occasional vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trevor observed that some of the voters were about to withdraw . He therefore rose , and begged them to remain . " This business is not over , " said he . " It is not for nothing that the polls are to be kept open until sunset , when all who have not voted have withdrawn . An attack on the sheriff or myself is certainly intended . Perhaps on both . I beseech you , therefore , not to disperse , but to see us both safe to my house . When once among my own people , I will take care of him and myself . I am sorry , sir , " continued he , addressing the officer , " that the movements of your friends make it necessary to detain you longer than I had intended . You must be a hostage for us all , until this day 's work is over . But assure yourself of being treated with all courtesy and kindness . Should I even find it necessary to compel your company to my own house , doubt not that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beg you to observe that I do not even disarm you . The warning you have received is my only security that you will attempt no violence . " This speech was heard in sullen silence by him to whom it was addressed . But some conversation with others ensued , in which Mr. Trevor took pains to enlighten the minds of his hearers in regard to public affairs . The day wore away somewhat less wearily ; the sun went down , and Bernard Trevor was proclaimed to be duly elected . Our party now took up the line of march . The sheriff and officer were placed in Mr. Trevor 's barouche ; the former by his side  --  the latter in front of him , by the side of the driver . A numerous company on horseback surrounded them . They were scarcely in motion , before the drum was heard , and the regulars were seen advancing to meet them in military array . Mr. Trevor immediately commanded the driver to stop , and draw his pistol . Then calling to the servant on horseback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the officer . Having made this arrangement , he addressed him : " You see your situation , sir . Those fellows would not scruple to shoot your master himself at my bidding ; and my orders to you both , boys , are , that if we are attacked , you are both to shoot this gentleman upon the spot . I shall do the same thing , sir ; so that between us you can not escape . Now , sir , stand up and show yourself to your men , and speak distinctly the words of command that I shall dictate . " The officer did as he was directed . The advancing platoon was halted , and wheeled backward to the side of the road ; the arms were ordered , and the barouche passed on . After passing , a momentary stop was made , while the sergeant was ordered to march the men back to their quarters . This was done , and as soon as the two parties were at safe distance asunder , Lieutenant Johnson was released , and courteously dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without interruption , and thus ended the election day . CHAPTER XXI . I tell you , my lord fool , that out of this nettle , Danger , we pluck this flower , Safety . Shakspeare . The domestic party that we left at the house of Mr. Trevor were variously affected by the history of the occurrences detailed in the last chapter . Arthur had been slightly indisposed , and his uncle had made that a pretext for keeping him out of harm 's way . But when he heard what had passed , his spirit was roused , and he felt as a soldier who hears the history of some well-fought battle where he was not permitted to be present . To Virginia the whole story was a subject of wonderment and alarm . The idea that her dear uncle , and her dearer brother , had been engaged in an affair where " dirk and pistol " was the word , threw her into a flutter of trepidation . She could not refrain from asking the former whether he would have shot the poor man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudder . The feelings of Lucia did not much differ from hers , except in intensity . She had heard too much to be wholly unprepared for such things , and her mind was too much accustomed to take its tone from those of her mother and sister . On these ladies the impression made by the events of the day was wholly different . If the countenance of Mrs. Trevor was more thoughtful than before , it only spoke of higher thoughts . Her eye was brighter , her carriage more erect , her step more free , while her smile had less , perhaps , of quiet satisfaction , but more of hope . The flutter of youthful feelings , and the sweeter and more tender thoughts proper to one newly betrothed , made the chief difference between Delia and her mother . But while Douglas saw in the latter all the evidence of those high qualities which fit a woman to be not merely the consolation and joy of her husband , but his sage adviser and useful friend , he saw enough in Delia to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that her mother was to his uncle . A few days afterwards , Mr. B  --  arrived , and his appearance was a signal of joy to the whole family . Douglas now , for the first time , discovered that he stood in some interesting , though undefined relation to them , and especially to his aunt . That there was no connexion of blood or marriage he knew ; yet the feelings of the parties towards each other were mutually filial and paternal . The imposing dignity of Mrs. Trevor 's manner seemed to be surrendered in his presence . Her maiden name of Margaret , which no other lip but that of her husband would have ventured to profane , was that by which alone he ever accosted her , and that generally accompanied with some endearing epithet . The girls would sit upon his knee , and play familiarly and affectionately with his grey locks ; while the servants , in the proud humility of their attention to his wants and wishes , seemed hardly to distinguish between him and their beloved and honored master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any secrets from him , so that Douglas could not doubt that he was privy to his little affair of the heart . And so he was ; and his manner toward the young man was , from the first , that of a near kinsman , hardly differing in any thing from that of his uncle . As far as coincidence of sentiment and similarity of character could explain this close intimacy , it stood explained . Between him and Mr. Trevor there were many points of strong similitude . But to Mrs. Trevor the resemblance was more striking . Age and sex seemed to make the only difference between them . But , in addition to this domestic relation , which embraced every member of the household down to the scullion and shoe-black , there was obviously some understanding between the gentlemen in regard to matters of much higher concernment . Indeed , no pains were taken to conceal this fact , though , during Mr. B  --  ' s former visit , Douglas had not been admitted to any of their consultations but that which concerned himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little study , in close conclave ; and soon after , a message was delivered to Douglas requesting his presence . " I am the bearer of important intelligence , " said B  --  , holding out his hand to the youth as he entered ; " and as it particularly concerns you , as well as your uncle , you must perforce consent to become privy to our council . " " I am not sorry to hear it , " replied Douglas . " If any thing was wanting to banish all reserve between us , I would be content to suffer some loss to effect that object . " " I believe you , " said B  --  , " and therefore expect you will the less regret an unpleasant circumstance , which , without your act or consent , and even in spite of you , binds you in the same bundle with us . " " That was already done , " said Douglas . " What new tie can there be ? " " One of the strongest . The union of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treason from the court of high commission at Washington . " " You speak riddles , " said Douglas . " The only instance in which I ever incurred the displeasure of the President , was one which no human ingenuity could torture into treason ; and certainly my uncle had no hand in that . " " But , having then incurred the displeasure of the Government , what if you should since have been concerned in any matter which might be called treason ? " " But there has been no such matter . " " My dear boy , " said Mr. Trevor , " the question is not of what we have done . Had we actually done any thing culpable , there would be no occasion for this warrant from Washington . Our own courts , and a jury of peers , may be trusted to try the guilty . But when men are to be tried for what they have not done , then resort must be had to this new court of high commission at Washington , and to a jury of office-holders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the warrant of which you speak ? " " That I can not exactly say , " said B  --  . " I am not even sure that it is yet in existence . But that it is , or will be , is certain . I need not explain to you my means of knowledge . Your uncle is acquainted with them , and knows that what I tell you is certain . The transactions of the election day will be made the subject of a capital charge , and it is intended to convey you both to Washington to answer it there . I am come to advise you both of this , that you may determine what course to pursue . " " My course is plain , " said Douglas . " To meet the charge , and refute it . " " Are you aware , " said B. " who is the Judge of this court of high commission ? " " I think I have somehow understood that it is Judge Baker . " " The father of your friend , Philip Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a few days before the court was constituted , he and other judges were consulted , and declared it to be so grossly unconstitutional that no judge would preside in it ? " " I see that so it should be declared , but did not know that such opinion had been given . " " Yet so it was . Now where , do you think , the considerations were found by which the honorable gentleman 's honorable scruples were overcome ? Of course , you can not conjecture . You would find it , all too late , if you , by placing yourself in his power , afforded him an opportunity of gratifying the malice of his son , without exposing his cowardice and meanness . I see you doubt my means of knowledge . Your uncle told me nothing of young Whiting 's communication to the President . Yet I knew of it . I know , " continued B  --  , not regarding the amazement of Douglas , " that , but for that letter , you would not have been permitted to resign ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new court were overcome by hushing up the enquiry , which would have dishonored his son , and substituting a proceeding which should number you among the victims of his power , without implicating the name of his son . As to my means of knowledge , when knaves can get honest men to be the instruments of their villany , they may expect not to be betrayed . Until then , they must bear the fate of all who work with sharp tools . " " There can be no doubt , " said Mr. Trevor , " of the fate prepared for us , should we fall into the hands of our enemies . To be summoned to trial before a court constituted for the sole purpose of entertaining prosecutions which can not be sustained elsewhere , is to be notified of a sentence already passed . To obey such a summons , is to give the neck to the halter . The question is , then , what is to be done to evade it . Our friend B  --  proposes that your brother and sister be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , withdraw to Carolina . How say you ? " " I have the same difficulty that I had , the other day , about tendering my resignation . But , in this instance , it appears with more force . To fly from justice is always taken as evidence of conscious guilt . " " About that , " said Mr. Trevor , " I feel small concern on my own account , as I certainly mean to commit what all who deny the sovereignty of Virginia will call high treason . " " Then why not take up arms at once ? I have much misunderstood appearances , since I have been here , if the means , not of evading , but resisting this attack , are not already organized . " " The time is not yet ripe for action , " said Mr. Trevor . " Had it been so , I should not have waited until my own head was in jeopardy , before striking the blow . Nor should my own personal danger precipitate it . " " But what fitter time can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment , when their minds are heated by the late violent invasion of the elective franchise ? What more exciting spectacle could be presented than the sight of a citizen seized as a traitor , and dragged away in chains , to answer , before an unconstitutional tribunal , for maintaining this franchise ? " " Are you then prepared to resist , at the point of the bayonet , this unconstitutional warrant , as a thing void and of no authority ? " " I am , " replied Douglas , with energy . " And I will say more , " said he , speaking with solemn earnestness . " I have seen enough to make my duty plain ; and I am prepared to go as far as you , yourself , in asserting and maintaining the sovereignty of Virginia at every hazard . " " That being the case , " said B  --  , " as you will not disagree about the end , you must not differ about the means , nor lose time in discussing them . We are not thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole ground , and act under the influence of considerations which we have no time to detail . Are you then , my young friend , prepared to give us so much of your confidence as this . We say to you , Go with us where we go , and trust our assurance that when we have leisure to explain all , you will find our plan the best . ' Are you content ? Are you now ready to carry into execution our matured plan , so far as it has been disclosed to you , trusting all the details to us ? Remember  --  if you say yes to this , we stop no more to deliberate or explain until we are in a place of safety . Until then , you place yourself under orders ; and you have learned how to obey . How say you ? Are you content ? Douglas paused , reflected a minute or two , and then , extending a hand to Mr. B  --  , and one to his uncle , said earnestly : " I am ; command , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to obey ? " " Mr. B  --  , " said Mr. Trevor , " under whose command I now place myself . " " Then to business , " said B  --  . " Warn your brother , at once , of the necessity of returning home with your sister , and see that he makes the needful preparations for his departure at an early hour to-morrow . The boy 's heart will have some hankerings that will make it necessary for you to look after him , and urge him to exertion . You , Trevor , must expedite the arrangements for the removal of your family . Pass the word to Margaret and Delia . You may trust much to their efficiency . I am afraid we can not expect much more from my poor little Lucia , just now , than from Arthur . Now , Trevor , give me the keys of your arm-room ; let Douglas join me there , as soon as he has set Arthur to work , and , in the meantime , send Jack to me there . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the black watch . " " The black watch ! " said Douglas , with an enquiring look . " Aye , " said B  --  . " The sidier dhu  --  the trusty body guard of a Virginia gentleman . His own faithful slaves . " " The slaves ! " said Douglas . " What use shall we have for them ? " " I have no time to answer now , " said B  --  . " Ask me that when you come to me in the arm-room . At present you must attend to Arthur . We have no time to lose . " Douglas now remembered his enlistment , and betook himself , with the prompt alacrity of an old soldier , to the fulfilment of his orders . END OF VOL . I. Back matter
