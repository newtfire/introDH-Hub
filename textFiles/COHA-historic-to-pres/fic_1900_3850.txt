Illustration Illustration Illustration THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE SNOW . Alice.  - -  One of your old-world stories , Uncle John , Such as you tell us by the winter fire , Till we all wonder it has grown so late . Uncle John.  - -  The story of the witch that ground to death Two children in her mill , or will you have The tale of Goody Cutpurse ? Alice.  --  Nay , now , nay ; Those stories are too childish , Uncle John , Too childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two good years , than he ; No , let us have a tale of elves that ride , By night , with jingling reins , or gnomes of the mine , Or water-fairies , such as you know how To spin , till Willy 's eyes forget to wink , And good Aunt Mary , busy as she is , Lays down her knitting . Illustration Illustration Uncle John.  --  Listen to me , then . ' T was in the olden time , long , long ago , And long before the great oak at our door Was yet an acorn , on a mountain 's side Lived , with his wife , a cottager . They dwelt Beside a glen and near a dashing brook , A pleasant spot in spring , where first the wren Was heard to chatter , and , among the grass , Flowers opened earliest ; but , when winter came , That little brook was fringed with other flowers ,  --  White flowers , with crystal leaf and stem , that grew In clear November nights . And , later still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side , that one might walk across , While , many a fathom deep , below , the brook Sang to itself , and leaped and trotted on Unfrozen , o'er its pebbles , toward the vale . Alice.  - -  A mountain 's side , you said ; the Alps , perhaps , Or our own Alleghanies . Uncle John.  --  Not so fast , My young geographer , for then the Alps , With their broad pastures , haply were untrod Of herdsman 's foot , and never human voice Had sounded in the woods that overhang Our Alleghany 's streams . I think it was Upon the slopes of the great Caucasus , Or where the rivulets of Ararat Seek the Armenian vales . That mountain rose So high , that , on its top , the winter snow Was never melted , and the cottagers Among the summer blossoms , far below , Saw its white peaks in August from their door . Illustration One little maiden , in that cottage home , Dwelt with her parents , light of heart and limb , Bright , restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the uneasy ocean waves , And sometimes she forgot what she was bid , As Alice does . Illustration Alice.  --  Or Willy , quite as oft . Uncle John.  - -  But you are older , Alice , two good years , And should be wiser . Eva was the name Of this young maiden , now twelve summers old . Now you must know that , in those early times , When autumn days grew pale , there came a troop Of childlike forms from that cold mountain top ; With trailing garments through the air they came , Or walked the ground with girded loins , and threw Spangles of silvery frost upon the grass , And edged the brook with glistening parapets , And built it crystal bridges , touched the pool , And turned its face to glass , or , rising thence , They shook , from their full laps , the soft , light snow , And buried the great earth , as autumn winds Bury the forest floor in heaps of leaves . Illustration Illustration Illustration A beautiful race were they , with baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the sound Of steps on the crisp snow , in which they talked With man , as friend with friend . A merry sight It was , when , crowding round the traveller , They smote him with their heaviest snow-flakes , flung Needles of frost in handfuls at his cheeks , And , of the light wreaths of his smoking breath , Wove a white fringe for his brown beard , and laughed Their slender laugh to see him wink and grin And make grim faces as he floundered on . But , when the spring came on , what terror reigned Among these Little People of the Snow ! To them the sun 's warm beams were shafts of fire , And the soft south wind was the wind of death . Away they flew , all with a pretty scowl Upon their childish faces , to the north , Or scampered upward to the mountain 's top , And there defied their enemy , the Spring ; Skipping and dancing on the frozen peaks , And moulding little snow-balls in their palms , And rolling them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Illustration Alice.  --  That , too , must have been A merry sight to look at . Uncle John.  --  You are right , But I must speak of graver matters now . Illustration Mid-winter was the time , and Eva stood , Within the cottage , all prepared to dare The outer cold , with ample furry robe Close belted round her waist , and boots of fur , And a broad kerchief , which her mother 's hand Had closely drawn about her ruddy cheek . " Now , stay not long abroad , " said the good dame , " For sharp is the outer air , and , mark me well , Go not upon the snow beyond the spot Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field . " Illustration The little maiden promised , and went forth , And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost Beneath her feet , and slid , with balancing arms , Into the hollows . Once , as up a drift She slowly rose , before her , in the way , She saw a little creature lily-cheeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That gleamed like ice , and robe that only seemed Of a more shadowy whiteness than her cheek . On a smooth bank she sat . Illustration Alice.  --  She must have been One of your Little People of the Snow . Uncle John.  - -  She was so , and , as Eva now drew near The tiny creature bounded from her seat ; " And come , " she said , " my pretty friend ; to-day We will be playmates . I have watched thee long , And seen how well thou lov'st to walk these drifts , And scoop their fair sides into little cells , And carve them with quaint figures , huge-limbed men , Lions , and griffins . We will have , to-day , A merry ramble over these bright fields , And thou shalt see what thou hast never seen . " Illustration On went the pair , until they reached the bound Where the great linden stood , set deep in snow , Up to the lower branches . " Here we stop , " Said Eva , " for my mother has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . " Then the snow-maiden laughed : " And what is this ? This fear of the pure snow , the innocent snow , That never harmed aught living ? Thou mayst roam For leagues beyond this garden , and return In safety ; here the grim wolf never prowls , And here the eagle of our mountain-crags Preys not in winter . I will show the way And bring thee safely home . Thy mother , sure , Counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide . " Illustration By such smooth words was Eva won to break Her promise , and went on with her new friend , Over the glistening snow and down a bank Where a white shelf , wrought by the eddying wind , Like to a billow 's crest in the great sea , Curtained an opening . " Look , we enter here . " And straight , beneath the fair o'erhanging fold , Entered the little pair that hill of snow , Walking along a passage with white walls , And a white vault above where snow-stars shed A wintry twilight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the snow-maiden smiled , And talked and tripped along , as , down the way , Deeper they went into that mountainous drift . Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration And now the white walls widened , and the vault Swelled upward , like some vast cathedral dome , Such as the Florentine , who bore the name Of heaven 's most potent angel , reared , long since , Or the unknown builder of that wondrous fane , The glory of Burgos . Here a garden lay , In which the Little People of the Snow Were wont to take their pastime when their tasks Upon the mountain 's side and in the clouds Were ended . Here they taught the silent frost To mock , in stem and spray , and leaf and flower , The growths of summer . Here the palm upreared Its white columnar trunk and spotless sheaf Of plume-like leaves ; here cedars , huge as those Of Lebanon , stretched far their level boughs , Yet pale and shadowless ; the sturdy oak Stood , with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of myrtle , roses in their bud and bloom , Drooped by the winding walks ; yet all seemed wrought Of stainless alabaster ; up the trees Ran the lithe jessamine , with stalk and leaf Colorless as her flowers . " Go softly on , " Said the snow-maiden ; " touch not , with thy hand , The frail creation round thee , and beware To sweep it with thy skirts . Now look above . How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up With shifting gleams that softly come and go ! These are the northern lights , such as thou seest In the midwinter nights , cold , wandering flames , That float , with our processions , through the air ; And here , within our winter palaces , Mimic the glorious daybreak . " Then she told How , when the wind , in the long winter nights , Swept the light snows into the hollow dell , She and her comrades guided to its place Each wandering flake , and piled them quaintly up , In shapely colonnade and glistening arch , With shadowy aisles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to bowery walks In gardens such as these , and , o'er them all , Built the broad roof . " But thou hast yet to see A fairer sight , " she said , and led the way To where a window of pellucid ice Stood in the wall of snow , beside their path . " Look , but thou mayst not enter . " Eva looked , And lo ! a glorious hall , from whose high vault Stripes of soft light , ruddy , and delicate green , And tender blue , flowed downward to the floor And far around , as if the aerial hosts , That march on high by night , with beamy spears , And streaming banners , to that place had brought Their radiant flags to grace a festival . Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration And in all that hall a joyous multitude Of those by whom its glistening walls were reared , Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds , That rang from cymbals of transparent ice , And ice-cups , quivering to the skilful touch Of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in spring , about a chimney-top , A cloud of twittering swallows , just returned , Wheel round and round , and turn and wheel again , Unwinding their swift track . So rapidly Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance , Beneath that dome of light . Bright eyes that looked From under lily brows , and gauzy scarfs Sparkling like snow-wreaths in the early sun , Shot by the window in their mazy whirl . And there stood Eva , wondering at the sight Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep Of motion as they passed her ;  - -  long she gazed , And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled The frosty air , till now the encroaching cold Recalled her to herself . " Too long , too long I linger here , " she said , and then she sprang Into the path , and with a hurried step Followed it upward . Ever by her side Her little guide kept pace . As on they went Eva bemoaned her fault : " What must they think --  The dear ones in the cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay without ? I know That they will seek me far and near , and weep To find me not . How could I , wickedly , Neglect the charge they gave me ? " As she spoke , The hot tears started to her eyes ; she knelt In the mid path . " Father ! forgive this sin ; Forgive myself I can not "  - -  thus she prayed , And rose and hastened onward . When , at last , They reached the outer air , the clear north breathed A bitter cold , from which she shrank with dread , But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt The cutting blast , and uttered shouts of joy , And skipped , with boundless glee , from drift to drift , And danced round Eva , as she labored up The mounds of snow , " Ah me ! I feel my eyes Grow heavy , " Eva said ; " they swim with sleep ; I can not walk for utter weariness , And I must rest a moment on this bank , But let it not be long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she sank on the smooth snow , With closing lids . Her guide composed the robe About her limbs , and said , " A pleasant spot Is this to slumber in ; on such a couch Oft have I slept away the winter night , And had the sweetest dreams . " So Eva slept , But slept in death ; for when the power of frost Locks up the motions of the living frame , The victim passes to the realm of Death Through the dim porch of Sleep . The little guide , Watching beside her , saw the hues of life Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek , As fades the crimson from a morning cloud , Till they were white as marble , and the breath Had ceased to come and go , yet knew she not At first that this was death . But when she marked How deep the paleness was , how motionless That once lithe form , a fear came over her . She strove to wake the sleeper , plucked her robe , And shouted in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed away from those young limbs . Then the snow-maiden raised a wailing cry , Such as a dweller in some lonely wild , Sleepless through all the long December night , Hears when the mournful East begins to blow . Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration Illustration But suddenly was heard the sound of steps , Grating on the crisp snow ; the cottagers Were seeking Eva ; from afar they saw The twain , and hurried toward them . As they came , With gentle chidings ready on their lips , And marked that death-like sleep , and heard the tale Of the snow-maiden , mortal anguish fell Upon their hearts , and bitter words of grief And blame were uttered : " Cruel , cruel one , To tempt our daughter thus , and cruel we , Who suffered her to wander forth alone In this fierce cold . " They lifted the dear child , And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs , And strove , by all the simple arts they knew , To make the chilled blood move , and win the breath Back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead . In blank despair They stood , and gazed at her who never more Should look on them . " Why die we not with her ? " They said ; " without her life is bitterness . " Illustration Illustration Now came the funeral day ; the simple folk Of all that pastoral region gathered round , To share the sorrow of the cottagers . They carved a way into the mound of snow To the glen 's side , and dug a little grave In the smooth slope , and , following the bier , In long procession from the silent door , Chanted a sad and solemn melody . Illustration " Lay her away to rest within the ground . Yea , lay her down whose pure and innocent life Was spotless as these snows ; for she was reared In love , and passed in love life 's pleasant spring , And all that now our tenderest love can do Is to give burial to her lifeless limbs . " They paused . A thousand slender voices round , Like echoes softly flung from rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hollow air Seemed mourning for the dead ; for , on that day , The little people of the snow had come , From mountain-peak , and cloud , and icy hall , To Eva 's burial . As the murmur died , The funeral train renewed the solemn chant . Illustration " Thou , Lord , hast taken her to be with Eve , Whose gentle name was given her . Even so , For so Thy wisdom saw that it was best For her and us . We bring our bleeding hearts , And ask the touch of healing from Thy hand , As , with submissive tears , we render back The lovely and beloved to Him who gave . " Illustration Illustration Illustration They ceased . Again the plaintive murmur rose . From shadowy skirts of low-hung cloud it came , And wide white fields , and fir-trees capped with snow , Shivering to the sad sounds . They sank away To silence in the dim-seen distant woods . The little grave was closed ; the funeral train Departed ; winter wore away ; the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , By fond hands planted where the maiden slept . But , after Eva 's burial , never more The Little People of the Snow were seen By human eye , nor ever human ear Heard from their lips , articulate speech again ; For a decree went forth to cut them off , Forever , from communion with mankind . The winter clouds , along the mountain-side , Rolled downward toward the vale , but no fair form Leaned from their folds , and , in the icy glens , And aged woods , under snow-loaded pines , Where once they made their haunt , was emptiness . Illustration Illustration Illustration But ever , when the wintry days drew near , Around that little grave , in the long night , Frost-wreaths were laid and tufts of silvery rime In shape like blades and blossoms of the field , As one would scatter flowers upon a bier .
