Harry Truman , who regards himself as something of an expert on history , last week seemed to have forgotten some of the not-too-distant past . <P> In Springfield , Mo . for the annual reunion of the 35th Division , Old Artilleryman Truman came out with guns blazing on the subject of the nation 's strength in the air . Republican Bob Taft had charged that U.S. airpower had been allowed to deteriorate , and had argued that the U.S. could save money and build better defenses by concentrating on a big Air Force . " Nonsense , " said Harry Truman . The nation 's air preparation has moved forward steadily , is on schedule , with 91 wings operating , four more almost ready to go . Getting on to the next point , Truman barked that people who talk about saving money on the defense program " are just doing it for strictly political purposes-political propaganda , political hooey , and that 's all it amounts to . " <P> What Truman seemed to have forgotten : in 1948 the Republican 80th Congress approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 was enough . In 1949 , still maintaining that 48 was plenty , he " placed in reserve " $615 million that Congress had appropriated to get 58 groups going . One big reason Truman gave at that time : Such a big expenditure on the Air Force might be too great a strain on the domestic economy .
