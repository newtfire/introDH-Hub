Dapper gentlemen with quick eyes and imperturbable faces frequent , or used to frequent , a little restaurant at 50th Street and Broadway , Manhattan . They are gentlemen with varied interests-dog and horse racing , realty , baseball , politics , lady friends , perhaps a side line now and then in narcotics or stolen securities . They are , or were , interested in almost anything involving money in sums of ten to a hundred " grand " ( thousand dollars ) , and some stimulating element of risk . <P> What takes them , or took them , to the little restaurant to see each other was a consuming desire to play with their money directly , on the turn of a card , the fall of dice . Between Central Park and 42nd Street , all around the little restaurant , is a forest of " broadminded " hotels where a man can keep a girl or a case of liquor or organize a fairly professional gambling game . Word would go to the little restaurant : " Room such-and-such , Hotel so-and-so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sports like themselves who would blow in from other big cities to " take that mob over the jumps . " <P> Of all the dapper gentlemen , none was more inspired and self-confident than Arnold Rothstein , a sleek Jew inclining to flesh in his late forties . Hotel managers fawned on him , because he owned a hotel himself . Newspaper editors disliked to call him " gambler " when he got into the news . The New York World used to euphemize and call him an " operator , " knowing well that many another citizen gambled as often though perhaps not so daringly as Rothstein . He won a few hundred " grand " on this year 's World 's Series-a contest which he was said to have " fixed " in 1919 . He was supposed to have " shot the works " ( bet all he had ) on Hoover 's election , most of it at the excellent odds of 8 to 5 . <P> One evening in late September there was a stud-poker and high-spade game in the apartment of one James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , but received a percentage for the use of his premises . The players were Arnold Rothstein ; George McManus , brother of a Manhattan police Lieutenant , Meyer Boston , shrewd Manhattan " operator " ; Edward C. ( " Titanic " ) Thompson , Chicago plunger ; " Nigger Nate " Raymond , San Francisco sport ; and a few lesser figures . Raymond was the big winner and a slick-looking fellow called " Tough Willie " McCabe , onetime Chicago beer-legger , was supposed to have a half interest in his play . <P> Rothstein was the big loser . At the end of the sitting he had to give his IOU for $349,000 . He gave another IOU for $49,000 in cash lying on the table , which he shoved into his pocket . " See you later , " he told them , and went his way .
