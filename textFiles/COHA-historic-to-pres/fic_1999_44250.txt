Dear Stan , <p> Enclosed is Brush with Destiny , sure hope you like it . I 'd be kinda surprised if this was n't the first yam you 've ever gotten about housepainting in space . Chalk it up to many hours spent working on a four-color Victorian " painted lady , " and considerable musing on how much easier it would be if I could just float up to where I needed to be . Man , I hate ladders . <p> Far too consummate a professional to waste your valuable time trying to talk you into buying the enclosed ( an option I highly endorse , by the way ) I do want to buttonhole you for a few minutes . <p> You see , Sue-Ryn and I have gotten tangled up in something so bizarre it buries the needles in our personal Weird-O-Meters . These are internal devices which , I might add , years of doing Renaissance Faires have built up to Super Heavy-duty Industrial Strength . I know you 're busy , but trust me , I 'm talking about a world-shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and to prove that we 're talking capital " S " Serious Stuff , consider this : I may be taking a trip . A long trip . That 's right , me , the guy who tends to emulate the Sphinx , travel-wise . I may not be going anywhere this time , either , but I am not optimistic . It 's probably gon na happen . <p> This whole thing started one fall afternoon a couple months back . I was working over on the north side of the island , remodeling a kitchen . The phone rang twice , went silent , then started ringing again . That 's the signal Sue-Ryn uses to make me pick up when I 'm working at someone else 's house . So I answered . <p> " Hey , love , what 's up ? " I said . <p> " Steve , you better come home , " she said , sounding seriously freaked . " Right now. , <p> " What 's wrong ? " I was trying to sound calm , but inside my head a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from hurt relatives to vehicles in the ditch to exploding hot water heaters . <p> " We got- " A pause to collect herself . <p> " We got something really strange in the mad . " <p> My blood pressure drops a few points , but only a few , as audits , lawsuits , and disconnect notices suggest themselves under the heading of Bad Mail . Before I could ask more about it , she pleads with me to just come home right now , please ? <p> I tell her I 'm on my way . Shut down the radio and heat , lock up the place , jump in the Beast and roar home at flank speed . The whole time I 'm trying to guess what could creep her out so . A ten-thousand-dollar Visa bill ? A CadaverO-Gram ? Letter bomb ? Vile crap from some hate group ? <p> By the time I did a high-speed powerslide into the driveway I was pretty nerved up myself . I explode from the car , race to the house . " OK , I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what I expected to see . I do know the sight that greeted me was n't one of the possibles chalked up in the smeary blackboard of my imagination . <p> Sue-Ryn 's standing there in the living room . Mail is scattered all over the floor . The object she was staring at with the fixed intensity of a cat watching an owl ( and which drew my eye toot-damnsweet ) was this envelope floating in the air before her at about eye level . <p> Yeah , floating . As in hanging there all by its own self . To make matters even more interesting , when I entered the room it turned in my direction and did this little mid-air curtsey , as if to say You made it ! Glad you came ! <p> I stop , blink , undergo a brief but intense reality crisis . I know I 'm seeing what I 'm seeing because it 's still several feet away . Birdwatching , I can spot stuff a mile off , but over the last few years it 's gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tad fuzzy . <p> " It came in the mail , " Sue-Ryn says heavily , her voice making it sound like the title of a B-grade horror flick . <p> " Letters do that , " I answer as I make my way over to her . <p> " But not this . " <p> " No , not hardly . <p> " What do you think it is ? " <p> " Fan mail from some flounder ? " I joke weakly , quoting an old Bullwinkle line used a lot around our house . I get a laugh , but not much of one . <p> " I brought the mail in after Glenn came , " she explained as I reached her side . " Started sorting the orders and bills from the junk . When I touched this thing it changed color and floated right up out of my hand . I let out a yell , jumped back , tripped over Boomer . He 's still hiding under the kitchen table . " Our dog Boomer-whose middle name happens to be Underfoot-makes the Cowardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before ? " I ask , my mouth sort of running on automatic pilot . When you fix stuff for a living you ask this sort of question by habit . Chromatropic hovering mail was n't really on my been there , done that list . <p> " Plain white . " Now it was the most amazing-excuse me , astoundingblue I 'd ever seen , like distilled sky . <p> " Any idea who it 's from ? " <p> She just gives me The Look . You know the one a hapless boob of a husband collects when he asks his wife a dumbass question , one she considers so utterly boneheaded it 's not worth dignifying with any other response . <p> I duck my head meekly . " I 'll take that as a no . " After a few moments more spent considering our Mystery Mail I sigh and mumble , " Guess there 's only one way to find out . " <p> I reach out and gingerly close my fingets around the envelope . The second I do it lets out this low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hammered dulcimer . <p> " What was that ? " Sue-Ryn asks nervously . It 's my turn to give her a milder version of The Look , one that basically says : How did I get to be the resident expert on floating musical mail ? <p> Back to the task at hand . The envelope does n't resist as I draw it closer , it comes along quietly . Like I said before , the color of the thing makes it seem like I 'm holding a chunk of distilled sky . It was n't made out of any kind of paper I 'd ever seen . Nor was it plastic , Tyvek , or any other material I 'd run across . The best I can do is say that it felt like silk , although it was n't cloth either . <p> On the front it read " STEPHEN L. BURNS &; SUE-RYN HILDENBRANDBURNS " in a nice sans-serif font . No address . Where the stamp or bulk mail permit should have been there was this hologram sort of thing . Remember those holographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Space ones ? Those were pretty primitive ; you had to have the right kind of light and hold them jussssssst so to see them . Not this puppy A little tiny orange sun hung there half an inch off the envelope 's surface , pinpoint planets wheeling around it . I could even see even tinier moons wheeling around them . BTW it was n't our sun or our planets . <p> " Any return address ? " Sue-Ryn asks from behind my shoulder <p> " Nope . " I 'm still staring at the hologram , and suddenly it hits me . I can see every detail plain as day even without my reading glasses ! <p> " Nothing to show who it 's from ? " <p> I shake my head . " Not unless a version of Publisher 's Clearing House from the year 2200 and based at another star system has figured out how to send junk mail into the past . " Scary concept : twohundred-year magazine subscriptions . <p> My wife frowns , prettily . " What makes you think it 's Them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implacable forces of evil that plague us with endless junk mail , and storm window or long distance carrier sales-calls at dinnertime . <p> I point to the top of the envelope . A line of print has appeared in glowing dots of ruby light . It scrolls across the envelope again and again like a marquee . What does it read ? You guessed it : <p> YOU MAY ALREADY BE A WINNER ! ! <p> " This is your department , my love , " I say as I try to hand it to her . She 's the one who fills in all the sweepstakes thingies . I take out the garbage . Division of labor is the secret to a successful marriage . <p> " That 's OK , " she replies , backing away . " You open it . " Her tone makes it pellucidly clear that as Guy of the House it 's my job to deal with anti-gravitic holographic mail . <p> Usually I just blow this sort of stuff off , sending it straight to the recycle bin . I figure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or get smutched by a plummeting Chinese satellite than to win a million dollars . Now if first prize was three tons of steaming fresh manure directly delivered to your living room I 'd probably win for sure .... <p> But it is n't every day you get levitating junk mail . <p> " What the hell . " I light a cigarette , only a minor stall tactic , then turn the envelope over . On the back is this square of star-flecked blue-black , surrounded by animated script that reads : PRESS HERE TO OPEN . - Great , I think , mail that opens as easily as an aspirin bottle . <p> I take a puff of my smoke then touch the square . The envelope lets out another musical tone , then sort of moves in my hand and swims before my eyes . The next thing I know I 'm holding a letter sized sheet of amazing-excuse me , I keep doing that , astounding-blue whatever-it-is . Sue-Ryn and I exchange a How the hell did it do that ? look , then we both begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still using me as a blast-shield . <p> " CONGRATULATIONS LUCKY EARTH LING ! " it begins .

No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> There under all that was another dark blue square , this one orbited by the phrase : " SOUNDS GOOD ! ! SIGN ME UP ! ! " <p> I read faster than my wife . I skimmed it a second time , looking for catches , and caught up with her at the end . <p> " Well , " I said in a bemused tone , <p> " We 've never been to Venus . " <p> " We never go much of anywhere , " she pointed out . There was this real flint note in her voice which seemed to suggest that Id been the reason we 'd passed up several previous chances to visit another planet and meet an alien race . <p> I stared at her . " You mean you 'd go ? " She bit her lip , then shrugged . " Sure . If you 'd go . " Meaning the decision was mine . <p> " Thanks , " I grumbled . My perfectly sensible natural inclination to avoid travel at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , excuses , and considerations both practical and admittedly far-fetched were popcorning in my head . <p> Unfortunately it was n't quite that simple- My equally natural cynicism and pessimism sort of buttered the popcorn with the thought , Right , like you 're going to win . Sweepstakes odds-for an all expenses paid alien vacation giveaway@ no less ! - made it safe to exhibit a cheapjack largesse and say : <p> " Sure . What the hell . If we win I 'll go . " <p> I thought I was home free until last month . It was a crummy day , and I was working upstairs in my office when the mail came . I went downstairs , grabbed a jacket and ran out to get it from our roadside box . As I was gathering up the ads , magazines , and real mail , another floating letter leapt out of the pile and hung there in the air before me . We seemed to stare at each other , me with dismay , and it as smug as first class . If that was n't bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to avoid it . <p> I knew this could n't be good newsat least not what I would consider good news . So I just left it hanging ( so to speak ) and headed back for the house . <p> Stan , the damn thing followed me ! Some of these junk mail bastards can be satanically persistent , bombing you with an endless flood of multiple mailings . We 've all grown used to that . But this thing was the Hellhound of junk mail . When I saw what it was doing I started to run . it just moved faster , zipping along beside me . I tried to slip through the door and leave it outside , but the damn thing flicked past me . <p> Sue-Ryn had come down from her workroom and was standing by the bottom of the stairs . " Any good mail ? " she asked . <p> " Not hardly , " I growled , making a futile grab for the envelope . It evaded me and flew straight to her like a trained bird , landing gently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back up at me with a big grin . <p> " Guess what ? " she crowed . " We 're semi-finalists ! " <p> Last week another letter came . That 's right . We frigging won . <p> Tomorrow at two we 're supposed to have our bags packed and be ready to go . No UFO 's in the back yard , they 're going to beam us right out of our living room and straight to the front desk at the Hotel Oh . I ca n't even plead logistics as a reason to cancel at the last minute . According to the prize packet they will see that we are , and I quote : ' for our convenience expeditiously returned to our own space-time continuum at a point . 75 minutes after we depart ! " <p> OK , you 've read all this and you 're probably thinking : But this is wonderful ! How can Burns bitch about the chance to see both another planet AND the virtual representation of an alien civilization , hobnob with other aliens AND all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but when you get right down to brass tacks I 'd stir prefer to stay home . Even if I 'm only going to be gone .75 minutes as far as home is concerned . <p> No , while I 'm not crazy about meeting new people , neither am I afraid of meeting these aliens . They seem nice enough , although their Up With People enthusiasm may not wear well . Our winners ' packet had several pictures of them . You know that Furby toy ? Cross one of them with a Munchkin and you 've got your average Oronomno Joe . The Hotel Oh looks quite nice . <p> There 's only one thing about this whole thing , and about them , that frightens me . <p> These folks have matter transmission . Time control . They can build a pocket environment on Venus , for chrissakes ! They want to be liked . They want to be accepted . They want to trade . <p> We have just given this technologically superior race the concept of junk mail , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . <p> I 'm going on this trip , I guess . I have reservations , but we have reservations . I 'll drop you a line at some future point to let you know how it went . <p> In the meantime , be warned and pass the word . <p> There 's an alien invasion coming . A benign invasion , but an invasion nonetheless . <p> Do n't bother watching the skies . <p> Watch your mail . <p>
