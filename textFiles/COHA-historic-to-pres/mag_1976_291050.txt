The meanings people find in the ink patterns of a Rorschach test reveal their personality . Americans have been intently studying , as they would Rorschach patterns , the images of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter-not to find out about themselves , but about the candidates . The first TV debate failed to bring that one lightning revelation of character that many had hoped for . Thus there is no substitute for studying the candidates through careful reporting and psychological surmise . <P> The two contenders share many traits . Both are men of integrity and decency . The cornerstone of Ford 's campaign is his claim to have restored trust to the White House . Among the Democratic candidates who competed in the primaries , Carter was the first to perceive that trust would probably be the major issue in the campaign . Each is offering his record of probity as an index to his trustworthiness . Both are devoted family men and each has a deep religious faith . Carter is a born-again evangelical ; Ford is an Episcopalian who participates in weekly White House prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " They come from modest origins , having achieved personal success with hard work . Neither has the style of an urban sophisticate like a Kennedy or Roosevelt . Both have high levels of self-control . " <P> Carter was never a star athlete , but he shares the competitive instincts that Ford honed on the gridiron at the University of Michigan . In less positive ways , too , there are similarities . Both candidates can also be quite stubborn when they have decided on a political course of action . <P> But there are major and obvious differences as well . Ford is affable and gregarious and enjoys nothing more than a bull session in the White House with old friends . Carter , although a good one-on-one campaigner who likes to meet people in public , has a deep sense of privacy and relaxes by taking solitary walks in the Georgia woods . Both are highly intelligent . But Carter is a quick study , introspective and contemplative ; Ford assimilates information more slowly , but has an impressive grasp of complex and diverse subjects . Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Carter is sometimes " almost too cool in his capacity to turn the other cheek , " but he displays flashes of anger ( " when he 's hot , he 's very hot " ) , which Greenstein contrasts with Ford 's equanimity . <P> As only five weeks remain before the election , and the " personality issue " seems more crucial than ever , TIME here presents assessments of the candidates by two correspondents who have regularly covered them . Dean Fischer reports on Ford , Stanley Cloud on Carter .
