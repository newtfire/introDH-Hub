FPC URGED TO END NIAGARA WATER USE BY UTILITY SELLER New York Authority Makes Demand Against Niagara Falls Power Company CONCERN CALLED ' TRUST ' But It Cites Progress of Area in Brief Backing Plea for Increased Diversion Special to- THE NEW YORK TENSES . WASHINGTON , March 2 ? Monopolistic practices and violation of Federal laws related to licensing of power operations were charged before the Federal Power Commission today against the Niagara Falls Power Company in briefs filed by attorneys representing the commission and the Power Authority of the State of New York . A brief was also filed on behalf of the company supporting its application to divert an additional 275 cubic feet per second of water from the Niagara River . The brief filed by counsel for the commission recommended that the application be denied , " as the applicant is inefficiently utilizing the water it now has under license . " It added that " plans of the applicant are not best adapted to develop , conserve and utilize in the public interest the navigation and water-power resources of the region in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Authority set forth many arguments for public development of the Niagara Falls resources and described in detail a program which the New York Authority would like to use to displace the Niagara Company . Declares Progress Spurred The utility 's brief defended its operations and went into the social phase of power production to argue that its alleged major concessions , to industrial consumers of power , as opposed to individual consumers , had assisted industrial and economic progress which has made the Niagara region outstanding in the United States , even though its retail consumers may pay somewhat more for electric current than do Canadians across the border . The briefs followed several months of hearings before the commission . These hearings , based upon the diversion application , turned largely into an inquiry concerning the whole conduct of the public utility . Briefs were filed as follows : For the commission , by W. H. Walker , assistant general counsel . For the New York Power Authority , George Stephens Reed and William S. Youngman Jr . For the Niagara Falls Power Company , Clarence R. Runals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power company , under a Federal license issued March 2 , 1921 , controls 19,725 cubic feet per second of flow at the Falls out of a total of 20,000 authorized for use on this side of the boundary under a treaty of 1909 . It seeks to use the full authorization . Continuous Violation Charged Mr. Walker declared : " Applicant is now and has been during the entire license period in violation of Section 10 ( h ) of the Federal Water Power Act and the Federal Power Act , by being a party to a combination , agreements , arrangements or understanding , expressed or implied , to // NIAGARA CLOSING TO UTILITY URGED // limit the output of electrical energy , to restrain trade , to fix ; maintain and increase prices for electrical energy and service . " The Walker brief added that " this monopolization of applicant 's power by large preferred industrial consumers has resulted in limiting the output , maintaining and increasing prices to residential and small commercial consumers . " The State Power Authority 's brief alleged violations of law by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power company delivered power directly to Buffalo General Electric for the account of Canadian Niagara , a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary , Canadian Niagara , which did nothing , receiving approximately $1,000 , - 000 in excess of the amount Niagara Falls Power Company obtained for the service . " The transactions were really part of an arrangement to divert funds to a company outside the State of New York from both the Buffalo General Electric and the Niagara Falls Power Company , particularly from the former , which was serving home owners and small commercial users . " Another example of a glaring violation of the Federal Water Power Act is found in the power company 's association with the Aluminum company in the course of which the power company was guilty of unlawful conduct in restraint of trade and discrimination between customers . " The brief for the Niagara company emphasized its contention , voiced in the hearings , that its policies have extraordinary social benefit , as demonstrated by the community it serves . " It is to be considered , " this brief stated , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the establishment and continuing prospertiy of large industries which have contributed substantially to the economic welfare of the community and of its individual residents is certainly not contrary to the public interest . " The question suggested itself whether it is not better to foster industrial activity which results in broader employment , higher payrolls and provision of the means whereby additional use of electric service for the home may be obtained , rather than to sacrifice the development of industry to a reduction of two or three dollars per year on the electric bill of the average domestic consumer . " Voiding of License Demanded By The Associated Press . WASHINGTON , March 2 ( 11 : ) ? Attorneys for the New York Power Authority demanded today that the Federal Power Commission cancel the present license of the Niagara Falls Power Company and suggested that its property in Western New York State be offered to new private bidders or be taken over as a public project . The company declared that it had millions of dollars invested in plants and equipment and that a commission order suspending its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western New York , which , it said , depended on the company for electricity .
