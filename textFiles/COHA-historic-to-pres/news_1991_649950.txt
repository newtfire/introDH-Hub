With the Federal Government and most of the states caught in a budget squeeze  --  New York may have a $4 billion deficit in the next fiscal year , New Jersey faces an $800 million shortfall and Virginia 's Governor , Doug Wilder , is proposing $1.9 billion in spending cuts  --  a question being asked by the National Council on Crime and Delinquency is right to the point : <p> " Why does our nation spend such an exorbitant amount of money each year to warehouse petty criminals ? " <p> We 're not talking chickenfeed here . The cost of imprisoning or jailing what is now more than a million Americans has reached $16 billion a year , as reported in a study by the Sentencing Project . A separate survey by the Crime and Delinquency Council found , however , that 80 percent of those going to prison are not serious or violent criminals but are guilty of low-level offenses : minor parole violations , property , drug and public disorder crimes . <p> " Warehousing " these petty criminals in the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly $7 billion in 1986 . The figure would be higher today because of a higher rate of incarceration ; and it 'll go higher still if that rate continues , as all signs suggest it will . <p> These costs might be acceptable if crime rates were going down commensurately ; but they 're not . The number of Americans behind bars has doubled since 1980 ; but the incidence of crime has fallen by only 3.5 percent . Council figures show that crimes of violence have not decreased at all . <p> Even so , the high cost of imprisonment might be justified if all those imprisoned were vicious killers and rapists ; but only one out of five has been convicted on a serious charge , and some of those crimes did not involve violence . <p> It 's not true , either , that we have so many inmates because we have so much crime . The Sentencing Project notes that crime rates climbed by 14 percent from 1984 to 1989 , but the number of prisoners rose by 52 percent in the same period . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem has caused a frightened public and political over-reaction  --  lock up more people for longer periods  --  that 's costing taxpayers dearly , while doing little , if anything , to provide a safer society . <p> New York State , for example , now imprisons about 55,000 people , more than a fourfold increase over the 12,500 in custody in 1973  --  but there has been nothing like a fourfold decrease in crime , if any at all . The high cost of building cells and " warehousing " all those people  --  most of them probably nonviolent petty criminals , as in the national survey  --  would have been more productively directed toward proven or promising programs of community corrections , work release , restitution to victims , community service , intensive supervision and the like . All cost far less than prison construction and operation . <p> Here are some other things that could be done to reduce the costs of imprisonment without endangering public safety : <p> * Amend or repeal the mandatory sentencing laws that in 46 states force the costly , often self-defeating incarceration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shift the emphasis of the so-called " war on drugs " from law enforcement , which is losing , to treatment and public health , which might do some good and would at least keep a lot of " offenders , " who are really victims , out of our prisons . <p> * Shorten individual prison sentences by three to six months ; early-release statistics show that this would rarely endanger public safety , while drastically reducing our prison population  --  now greater , even per capita , than those of the Soviet Union and South Africa  --  and its immense costs to taxpayers . <p> * For those necessarily imprisoned , provide improved educational and vocational services and drug treatment where required , to reduce what is now the overwhelming likelihood that those released will quickly be reincarcerated . <p> * Redirect police efforts to " community policing , " in an effort to address problems before they become crimes , and to respond more quickly and effectively when crimes are committed . <p> Most serious students of crime believe that these steps would make our streets safer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lock ' em up and throw away the key . " But only community policing has much political support ; and most serious students of politics will tell you not to hold your breath until panicky public fears and punitive public attitudes cool enough to permit such sensible anti-crime policies .
