By Lion . A. S. C'olyar . THE recent meeting of the National Educational Association at Nashville has lent new interest to this , city of refinement and culture . The majority of the members of the Association were from the northern and eastern sections of the country , and their meeting at Nashville was the first opportunity many of them had had for social mingling with the people of the South . The cultivation of closer relations between the people of the sections , with xiore frequent opportunities for a better acquaintance , is the surest extinguisher of the lingering prejudices fed and fanned by indiscreet politicians at both ends of the line . The masses have but to know each other as they are , and not as they seem when seen through the heated harangues and selfish motives of an interested class , to bring about a more perfect bond of union . Uninfluenced by passion , the people of the South and the people of the North have no disposition to keep alive the issues and the feelings of the war . for variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to the same extent of country to be found anywhere else on the globe . The soil combines the good qualities of the prairie with the lasting strength of the forest lands . Blue grass grows with the same prodigality and profusion as in the blue grass regions of Kentucky , with this noticeable advantage in favor of the blue grass region of Middle Tennessee , - an abundance of water . The first settlement of Nashville by the whites was made in i 780 , by a band of heroic pioneers led by General James Robertson . They left the mountainous Wautauga settlement , which is now upper East Tennessee , and which was also settled by a colony of Virginians led by General Robertson before the Revolution , to try their fortunes in the fertile valley of the Cumberland . This was then the hunting ground of the Cherokees and the Chickasaws , two large tribes that stood ready to repel the invasion of their territory by the Nashville is situated on the left bank of the winding Cumberland , about two hundred miles above its mouth , surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of them now famous in history , and still bearing the sign-manual of war in the many crumbling breastworks which surmount them . It is situated in the centre of a large belt of country , comprising eighteen or nineteen counties , that whites ; and serious casualties resulting from Indian attacks were of frequent occurrence . Many of the settlers , however , had been followers of John Sevier , and were veterans ' of the numerous battles with the Indians through a period of ten years . Some of them had shared in the decisive victory of King 's Mountain , where Ferguson lost his life and the greater portion of his command ; which result turned the The Upper Landing , Nashville . // NASHViLLE . tide of the Revolution and made American independence an assured fact . The route pursued by General Robertson and a portion of the settlers was by the now historic Cumberland Gap and through what is now Kentucky , while the remainder of the party , including the women and children , came by water . The distance by water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attempted by man , red or white ; but the western pioneer was of a race schooled to hardships and accustomed to endurance , hesitating at no undertaking . After five months of mishaps and privations , under the leadership of Colonel John Donelson , they successfully accomplished their voyage . Among those who shared the dangers of this hitherto unattempted voyage was the black-eyed , black-haired Rachel Donelson , the future Mrs. Andrew Jackson - " the great Captain 's captain . " General Robertson and his party arriving first , they went into camp until the spring of 1780 , when *aptain Donelson arrived with the women and children . It now became necessary to provide places more in conformity with the demands of civilization than the tent . Rude log cabins were built and forts were erected for the necessary protection of the ettlers . The main one , which was the headquarters of the settlement , was built at the foot of Church street , now the central portion of the city . Many were the Indian fights recorded and many and trying were the hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventurous pioneer and fully equal to the emergencies of the perilous times . Jackson Statue . State House , Nashvtle. // Thus was the foundation of this city of schools and churches laid , and such were the hardy forefathers of its population . From such a stock must come a people destined to play a prominent part in the history of the country . Nashville early became a prominent point , and has much more than contributed its share to the march of western civilization . In historic incident it is richer than any of the cities of the South . Its public men have been for almost a century prominent in the councils of the nation , and an article on Nashville would be incomplete without reference to them . First in order is Andrew Jackson . He came upon the scene early after the settlement , and the part he played in driving the red man farther into the western wilds is a matter of history . There are one or two well-authenticated incidents in the life of Jackson , illustrative of his character , which did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are well worth relating . In the County Court records of Sumner county , adjoining the county of which Nashville is the capital , in the fall of 1787 , occurs this entry : " The thanks of this Court are tendered to Andrew Jackson , Esq. , for efficient conduct . " In the territorial days of Tennessee the monthly County Court was the tribunal having criminal jurisdiction . It was derived from the Virginia system of jurisprudence . The entry tendering the thanks of the Court is signed by two Douglasses and a Musklewrath , justices . James Douglass lived to be a very old man , and Judge Joe C. Guild , who came to be a very intimate friend of Jackson , gives in his Old Times in Tennessee , a book of reminiscences with a local circulation , an explanation of the entry as he got it from the lips of Squire Douglass . Says Judge Guild : " I took him Douglass to the clerk 's office , read that entry signed by him , and asked if he could explain the occasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the circumstances well , and said the first County Court was held in a log cabin on the bank of the Court-House. creek , at one of the station camps . The County Court had jurisdiction and took steps to put down the fights and perChurch Street . // Theatre Veedome. sonal rencounters that were in those days very frequent . Jackson was the attorneygeneral for all Middle Tennessee . Two men named Kirkendall were the great bullies of that creek . They were spirited and powerful men . They held that the sitting of the Court , taking such jurisdiction , invaded their dominions , and they went in in a bullying manner and dispersed the Court , ordering it never to meet again . General Jackson heard of it , and attende4 the next term , carrying upon his arm his saddlebags containing his long black bull dogs . ' He placed his saddle-bags in a corner of the house . The justices took the bench , and the sheriff proclaimed the Court open . The Kirkendalls appeared and ordered the Court to disperse . In the confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties and restore order . At this juncture young Jackson appeared before the Court and denounced the bullies and their conduct , and told the Court if they would sustain him as their officer , he would arrest them and have order . This proposition was readily accepted . Jackson seized one of the Kirkendalls , who was a terror to the country ; they clinched and got outside and , being on the edge of the bluff the bully threw Jackson , and they rolled over and over down the bluff into the creek . When the bully thought he had conquered J acksom he left him . But Jackson came rushing up the hill , as wet as an otter , in search of the bull dogs . ' He grasped them and , pointing one at each of the bullies , arrested them and brought them before the Court . They were heavily fined and order was restored , and hence the thanks of the Court were tendered to Jackson for efficient conduct . " There is another incident in the life of Jackson that has escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related and as faithfully illustrating the character of the man of iron . Jackson was in early life a great lover of race horses , and up to the time that he reached the presiden i tial chair was a patron of the turf , owning and running some of the most famous horses of his day . Indeed , he owned race horses after he was Custom House sod First Bsptist Church . // elected president , but he abandoned the practical sport . In Jackson 's racing days the course was represented by such men as himself , Governor William Carroll , Governor Cannon , Colonel Bailey Peyton , the latter for a long time a member of Congress ; but the glory of the track , as well mation was correct . When the hour for the race arrived , Jackson was seen riding down the middle of the track with a pistol in each hand , followed by General Patten Anderson and two or three other friends . He rode up to the judges ' stand and told them what he had learned , and said there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson 's interference , he grew exceedingly angry , and swore , " by the Eternal God , " he would kill the first man that attempted to bring a horse on the track ; that the people 's money should not be stolen from them in any such manner . He soon cooled down , however , and announced that he would " give the scoundrels a fair chance " ; and to that end he organized a Court on the track , introduced the proof establishing the truth of his information , and announced the judgment of the Court . He declared all bets off ; and directed the people to go to the pound and get their negroes and cattle and horses , that had been bet on the race , and ordered all the money returned to the proper parties . Judge Guild , though a very small boy , was an eye-witness of the incident ; and in his graphic description of the as its reputation for fair dealing , has long since departed , and the sport is now almost exclusively in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a degree of intense state pride that always prompted him to hazard his money or negroes or land , or whatever class of property was wagered , on the Tennessee horse . In 1807 or i8o8 , a match race , to be run at Clover Bottom , near Nashville , for $5000 a side , was arranged between Greyhound , a Kentucky horse , and Double Head , a Tennessee horse . Twenty thousand people from Tennessee and Kentucky had assembled to witness the race . Large amounts of money and negroes and land had been bet on the result . Early in the morning of the day that the race was to be run , the information came to Jackson 's ear that the Kentucky National cemetery . horse had been tampered with ; that he qwq // 135 The Polk House and Tomb .

The unfortunate circumstances connected with his marriage , and the slanders whispered about his wife leaving Robards to marry him , seemed to increase his tenderness and to lend gentleness to his feelings and manner towards her , and the wrath fired in his bosom by any public allusion to it could only be appeased by the blood of the slanderer . It was an unguarded remark of this nature , made on the race-course at Nashville , that caused him to kill Dickinson , which it is said he never regretted . tunate separation , which was surrounded with a mystery so dense that none of his biographers have been able to penetrate it , took place . His most intimate friends were only able to conjecture the cause .

The whole truth is , that Miss Allen was dazzled by Houston 's political prominence , and was persuaded by her family to make the alliance when her heart did not thoroughly approve . She discovered her mistake too late , and was unable to conceal the true condition of affairs from her husband , and her own misery was the result . From all the data in my reach I am sure this was the head and front of her offending . At one time Nashville was the home of Thomas H. Benton . His difficulty with General Jackson was probably the cause of his leaving the state . He was a colonel under Jackson in the campaign against the Indians in the spring of 1812 , when Jackson disobeyed the orders of the Secretary of War , and was sent by Jackson to Washington to reconcile the department . He succeeded , but on his return he found Governor Carroll and Jesse Benton in the act of fighting a duel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to Jackson , and hence the fight in which Jackson was shot in the arm . Benton commenced the practice of law in an adjoining county - Maury . An entry on the docket there yet remains - the first court he ever attended - in these words : " Thomas H. Benton is fined one dollar for swearing in open court . " In Jackson 's campaign of 1812 originated the now worldwide motto , " Be sure you are right and then go ahead . " The fact was given me personally by General XVilliam Moore , in these words : " I was a captain , but a very young man , in that command . Davy Crockett was in my company , quite young and awkward . I had trouble with my men and told them I would go and lay my complaints before Residence of William M. Duncan . Suburban Residence of Jere Baxter . // the General . I did so , and young Crockett officiously went along .

' Returning to camp , the boys wanted to know what the General said , when Davy Crockett , with a big laugh , said , The General told the Captain to be sure he is right and then go ahead . ' " General Moore informed me that the next day Crockett 's words were in the mouth of every soldier in the regiment , and they were used all through the campaign . " Be sure you are right and then go ahead , " is a common saying now wherever the English language is spoken . James K. Polk , John Bell , and Felix Grundy , men of national renown , all lived in Nashville and are all buried there . The many public men who were natives and citizens , and who have stood with the foremost men of the nation , and the many episodes of interest recorded in its early and more recent history , serve to mark the prominent place which Nashville has held among the cities of the Union . In 1797 Nashville was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Orleans , - the eldest afterwards King of France , - on their way to the French settlements in Louisiana . LaFayette , while a guest of the United States , by invitation of President Monroe , spent a week in Nashville and at the Hermitage . President Monroe and many of his successors have thought the city of sufficient political importance to call for a visit . The famous Whig Convention of August , 1840 , that put the memorable " log cabin , " " coon skin " canvass in motion , was held in Nashville , and much interesting local history was made during these incidents in the early times of the city . Already rich in historic incident , Nashville has grown to be a city rich in commerce and manufacture . From the devastating influence of a war that swept away all but brain and brawn controlled by well-directed energy , in the short space of two decades it has emerged from a city with a population of 25,000 , by the census of 1870 , to a flourishing city of 100,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their veins the blood of the pioneer settlers . With a transmitted persistency of purpose and elasticity of vigor they overcame obstacles and changed reverses into success . The geographical position of Nashville placed it between the upper and nether millstones of war . It was occupied first by one army , then the other , causing its citizens more loss than was probably sustained by any other southern city ; but in an almost incredibly short space of time its people have regained all their losses , including the slave loss , and more than doubled their wealth . History nowhere records a parallel to the rerults of the revived energies of the people of the South just emerging from a war so destructive to property , and at the same time fastening upon them new and changed conditions ; and Nashville , from the day arms were stacked , has been abreast of the progress . With a model system of municipal government ; with a population thoroughly infused with the elixir of life ; with unsurpassed commercial advantages ; located adjacent to immense coal fields and iron-ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with educational advantages unequalled by any city in the South , Nashville has a future promised to but few cities in the whole country . While retaining the pride of their aristocratic ancestry , and cherishing the fondest memories of old Nashville , proud of its history , the people have adapted themselves with wonderful energy and aptitude to the new and changed condition of things . They have risen phcenixlike from the ashes of a devastating war , with a rapid and almost unparalleled progress , which entitles them to rank as a great people . In ante-bellum days wealth flowed into the South , requiring but little individual effort ; but with the new order of things we find the people of the South filly realizing the necessity for individual effort , and everywhere industries of all kinds are springing up . The agriculturist is catching the spirit of activity , and where one blade of grass and one stalk of cotton formerly grew he is making the soil yield two . Nashville , where manufacturing before the war was an industry but little known , now has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ooo , ooo , giving employment to 10,000 laborers . All of the heavier varieties of cotton goods are manufactured , comparing favorably with the fabrics of the best mills in the world . The products of the Nashville mills are // *i *l * *H*HL =*H*J I q * - - * In K - * - - - K*b -* *m K *L IL L Baxter Court . not only sold throughout the United States , but are exported and sold in Europe . There are a number of establishments engaged in iron and wood work , making boilers , engines , and machinery , saws , guns , agricultural implements and wagons , including seven furniture manufactories making all grades of furniture . Nashville has seven stove and tin-ware works , with an annual output of 75,000 stoves , 35,000 mantels , 32,000 grates , and r , 5oo , ooo pounds of hollow ware . It has four large fiouring mills competing successfully with the mills of the great Northwest . It is the first paper and book publishing city in the South . The city enjoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , handling two hundred millions of feet annually ; and it is the fifth *ener* 1 lumber market . The leading timber is yellow poplar , which is said to be superior in quality to the poplar of other regions , being entirely free from gray streaks and black specks , which are quite common in the poplar of many other sections ; and it is in such abundance in the forests that are accessible to the Nashville market as to be practically inexhaustible . Nashville 's commercial reputation is not of recent making . It is the leading jobbing market in the South , and has long enjoyed that reputation . For fifty years the Nashville merchants have been famous for their financial solidity , and have had an established credit in New York , Boston , and Philadelphia , and wherever their trade carried them , equal to that of the merchants of any city in the Union . It ranks as the fourth boot and shoe market in the United States ; and in all other lines of merchandise its merchants are distinguished for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept pace with the commercial and manufacturing progress , and there is no city in the South better supplied with banking capital . In T8So there were only six banking establishments , with a capital of $2,000,000 . They have now grown to eleven , with $6 , ooo , ooo capital . No city that I have visited in the South is so well supplied with street railroad facilities . Recently the electric car has supplanted the mule on two of the principal lines , and the other street railroads are preparing to follow suit , thus making rapid transit to all parts of the city . Until within the past year the city was The Duncan House . // without parks , but that long-felt want is being rapidly supplied . Two large parks , accessible located in Hon. WUhiam M. Duncan . by dummy lines , have been the suburbs ; and club-houses Hon. Jere . Baxter . *nd other buildings for the convenience and amusement of citizens seeking recrea tion have been erected . Nature has beautified these parks with the towering native forest trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fertile soil , leaving nothing to the art of man to render them attractive . A city is sometimes judged by its public spirit as evidenced in its public buildings , its churches , its schools , and especially its public schools . Measured by this standard , Nashville will not suffer in comparison with any city of its size . Its magnificent churches are a monument to its Christian civilization ; towering above the other buildings , they are the silent witnesses for the mass of Nashville 's population . A church-going people are sure to have their morals well attended to , and active handmaids to the church are sure to follow as a result . The Young Men 's Christian Association has erected an imposing structure of great architectural beauty , and nowhere are members of this organization more active and zealous in their labor of love , doing effective work for their cause . Referring to the public buildings of Nashville , the Capitol must take precedence . It occupies the crest of an eminence overlooking the entire city , and is conspicuous from every approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks every inch a State-house where may congregate the combined wisdom of a commonwealth . Tennessee is rich in building-stone , and everything that enters into the building , from the limestone foundation block to the marble stairways , the wealth of Tennessee quarries furnished . The Custom-house is of modern architecture , built entirely of Tennessee stone . It is said by some to be the most beautiful government building in the United States . Its cost was about $500,000 , and the government certainly came nearer getting value received for the money expended than it sometimes does . The Watkins Institute and Library are the bounteous gift of a late wealthy citizen , dedicated to public use . The Randall Cole Reformatory and the Orphan Asylum , the Insane Asylum , and the Blind Asylum are all splendid buildings that would be a credit to any city , and are a standing tribute to the liberality of the people of Nashville in taking care of their unfortunates . But perhaps the pride of Nashville is it // public school system . Nashville was the first city in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it has uarded it with a jealous care , improving it every year until it has now a perfect school system that any city might well be proud of . The negroes pay no taxes , comparatively speaking , and hence the burden of educating the negroes is falling alone upon the white people of the South . But there is no complaint . I do not remember to have heard a single tax-payer offering this as an objection to paying the school tax . While there is diversity of opinion as to whether the negro 's condition , in the light of his surroundings , is really bettered by an education , every tax-payer in Nashville , and I think in the South , is willing to contribute his per cent . of taxable property to give him an education if he is inclined to take it . As an evidence of the truth of this statement it can be asserted with absolute accuracy that no city in the United States is so liberally providing for the education of the negro . The negro is the creature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he finds most sympathy of a substantial nature among the people who have known him longest and know him best . The points in and around Nashville of most interest to the visitor are the Hermitage , the Polk Place , the National Cemetery , Forts Negley , Gillam , and Morton , and Belle Mead . The Hermitage , the home and tomb of Andrew Jackson , is full of historic interest . It is one of the places which almost every stranger visits . After General Jackson 's retirement from public life , it was there that leaders of the Democratic party , just before each convention , would assemble to formulate , under the suggestions of the old hero , the policy of the party . It is situated on the Cumberland River , about twelve miles from the city , and is accessible by water , railroad , and pike . Some years after the death of General Jackson , the homestead was purchased by the State , and it was held by the State until the meeting of the Legislature in January last , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hermitage Association , an association organized for the purpose of perpetuating the memory of the great hero and statesman . The State had neglected the property and allowed it to go very much to decay . This association of ladies will now devote itself to repairing the mansion , restoring the tomb , adorning and beautifying the grounds , preserving the relics and furniture now at the Hermitage , and rendering the place of even greater interest to visitors . The National Cemetery , located on the The Drive to Belle Mead . // Louisville and Nashville Railroad , about six miles from Nashville , is next in size to the Arlington Cemetery . Its 16,553 stones mark the last resting-place of as many soldiers , in this silent city of the dead Union soldier . Nearly every State in the Union is represented . It is a place of peculiar and tender interest to every Northern man , and especially to every exUnion soldier who visits Nashville . It is a picturesque spot , and has been beautified by the government 's liberal expenditure and watchful care , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Polk Place is perhaps more universally visited by strangers than any of the other points of interest mentioned . This results from its accessibility , it being in the centre of the city , and the further fact that the stately mansion is still presided over by the widow of the illustrious James K. Polk . But a few days ago she celebrated her eighty-sixth birthday . Notwithstanding her fulness of years , she is the same charming hostess that rendered the White House so attractive during the administration of Mr. Polk , in full possession of her mental faculties , and well stored with interesting reminiscences . A visit to Mrs. Polk is one of the delightful incidents that a stranger always remembers . In a general way I may say that the rapid development of the territory comprising the middle South , during the past four or five years , has attracted a good deal of attention ; yet , notwithstanding the fact that many are cognizant of some of the steps taken by capital to develop its vast mineral , lumber , and agricultural resources , few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer the probabilities of the near future . The census of 1890 will delight the public-spirited southern man , and astound our northern friends . The great development which took place in the Northwest from 1875 to 1883 was up to that time unprecedented . Capital and immigration within eight years created an empire out of a wilderness . The same forces are now at work in the South . The tide of capital which flowed into Nebraska , Kansas , Iowa , Minnesota , and the Territories , has turned southward . Hundreds of thousands of dollars are invested each week in ore , coal , iron , marble , and timber lands . Railroads are being rapidly constructed , manufactories built , and furnaces put in blast . Every part of the South is feeling the impetus of capital , and is growing in wealth . Every year but adds to an agricultural knowledge , and large and diversified crops reward our farmers . Iramigration , while not yet large , is steadily increasing . There has been more immigration to the South during the last three years than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be peopled by double its present population , does not admit of a doubt in the mind of any one who knows how rapidly the population is increasing . One result of these facts will be the natural growth of the southern cities . Those best situated will grow most rapidly . Natural laws control the growth of cities as much as the growth of plant life . They can not be disregarded or ignored . The cities which have the best climate , the best drainage , the best water , the best schools , the best commercial situation , and which offer the greatest inducements to capital , will necessarily attract the largest population , and most certainly and rapidly grow in size and importance . Few cities in the world are so healthful or have so good a climate as Nashville . The extreme heat of the South and the cold of the North are alike unknown . Nashville is the centre of a territory which is almost an empire within itself ; a territory in which everything necessary to the maintenance and comfort of life can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers and abounds in vast deposits of coal and iron ; a territory with millions of acres of hard woods of every variety ; a territory which can easily sup-. port a city of 5oo , ooo people , and in the course of time will do so ; a territory which , taken as a whole , is not surpassed in the Union . In this territory Nashville stands without a rival . Her commercial , industrial , and educational supremacy are acknowledged . Nashville has always been a very conservative city , and while her conservatism has made her institutions solid financially , it has . to a great degree prevented her growth . This excessive conservatism has so far influenced the prices of real estate , that in no growing city of the United States , of one-half her size , is real property so cheap as it is here . Strangers have asked in astonishment , " Why are prices so low here , and so much higher in these smaller // cities , of Knoxville , Chattanooga , Birmingham , Atlanta , and Memphis ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property here sells for less than its intrinsic value . With the improvements going on within the city limits , this can not long continue . During the past two and a half years more than $6 , ooo , ooo have been invested in permanent improvements within three miles of the City Hall ; and , as has been said , there are now three dummy lines and two electric motor lines , in addition to the horse-car systems , giving rapid transit for the suburban population . There is only one element lacking to make the city grow rapidly and double its real-estate value . New lines of railroad have been prospected through our undeveloped territory , which will , when built , add immensely to our population and commerce . New railroads in middle Tennessee mean cheaper fuel and cheaper transportation ; and when these twin handmaids of commerce are added to our present needs , it will be difficult indeed to measure the great impetus which will be given to diversified manufacturing in Nashville . Fortunately for Nashville , the railroads so essential to her development as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly approaching her limits . The Tennessee Midland Railroad will soon reach the city . With the Midland as a finished road will come the Ohio Valley Railroad , the completion of the Nashville and Knoxville road to the coal and oil fields of the Cumberland Mountains , the Nashville and Charleston , the Chesapeake and Nashville , and the Florida Northern ; and probably the Cincinnati and Birmingham , the Evansville and Chattanooga , and the Decatur , Fayetteville , and Gallatin roads . It can not be long , in the very nature of things , before the territory naturally tributary to Nashville is fully occupied by railroads , which will be taxed to their fullest capacity to carry the products of our coal-mines , ore-banks , furnaces , forests , marble quarries , etc. , in addition to the agricultural products which are groxvn in such variety and profusion in middle Tennessee . The city government of Nashville and the men who have since the war devoted themselves to her industrial interests deserve something more than can be afforded them in a magazine article embracing the city with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests the city is indebted to comparatively few men . Most of her rich men are conservative . Some are rich-conservative , while at the same time progressive . Others are progressive , but with so much dash that they can not be called conservative . Of the first clas are such men as E. W. Cole and James C. Warner , the latter the foundation and corner stone of our iron industries . Jere . Baxter and XV . M. Duncan have taken the lead in that progressive development which has . shown dash , versatility , courage , and success without the conservatism . The Tennessee Coal , Iron , and R.R. Co. , of which the latter is practically at the head , - Senator Platt , the president , is not concerned in the active management , - is the largest company of its kind in the United States . A few years after the war , when the white people were nearly all disfranchised , Nashville was in the hands of men who had collected from all quarters and taken charge of the city 's affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremity , and to save themselves from being robbed , resorted to the Courts and had a receiver appointed for the city , a thing never known either in England or in this country before . Hon. Arthur 5. colyar. // The thieves fled to prevent prosecution , but the narrow escape from ruin and subsequent inroads on the city brought a realization that heroic treatment and a radical change in the accepted theory of city government were demanded . The predicate was that a city government is business , not politics , - that it is a trust ; and so the city abolished the old formula of legislation in city government and , while preserving a City Council , put the business in the hands of a Board of Public Works - a board of three men , with a salary of $4000 each , selected by the City Council for long terms , only one going out at a time . The change from the old system borders on the miraculous in economy and progress . Nashville 's magnificent water-works , the best in the South , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite , her new public school buildings , her magnificent bridge across the Cumberland , her bonds ( 4 per cent ) above par , and her low tax rate , all mark the difference between a political machine and a business organization .
