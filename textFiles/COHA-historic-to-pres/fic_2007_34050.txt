: The Bank Job Doug MacRay stood inside the rear door of the bank , breathing deeply through his mask . Yawning , that was a good sign . Getting oxygen . He was trying to get amped up . Breaking in overnight had left them with plenty of downtime to sit and eat their sandwiches and goof on each other and get comfortable , and that was n't good for the job . Doug had lost his buzz  --  the action , fear , and momentum that was the cocktail of banditry . Get in , get the money , get out . His father talking , but fuck it , on this subject the old crook was right . Doug was ready for this thing to fall . He swung his head side to side but could not crack his neck . He looked at the black .38 in his hand , but gripping a loaded pistol had long since lost its porn . He was n't there for thrills . He was n't even there for money , though he would n't leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The job of the job , like the thing of the thing . Him and Jem and Dez and Gloansy pulling pranks together , same as when they were kids  --  only now it was their livelihood . Heisting was what they did and who they were . His blood warmed to that , the broad muscles of his back tingling . He rapped the hard plastic forehead of his goalie mask with his pistol barrel and shook out the cobwebs as he turnedtoward the door . A pro , an athlete at the top of his game . He was at the height of his powers . Jem stood across from him like a mirror image : the dusty navy blue jumpsuit zipped over the armored vest , the gun in his gloved hand , and the white goalie mask marked up with black stitch scars , his eyes two dark sockets . Happy voices approaching , muffled . Keys turning in reinforced locks , strongbars releasing . A spear of daylight . A woman 's hand on the knob and the kick of a chunky black shoe  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life . He seized the branch manager 's arm and spun her around in front of him , showing her the pistol without jamming it in her face . Her eyes were green and bright and full , but it was his mask that scared short her scream , not the Colt . Jem kicked the door shut behind the assistant manager , smacking the cardboard caddy out of the guy 's hand . Two steaming cups of coffee splattered against the wall , leaving a runny brown stain . Doug took the bank keys from the manager 's hand and felt her going weak . He walked her down the short hallway to the tellers ' row behind the front counter , where Gloansy  --  identically dressed , masked , and Kevlar-bulked  --  waited . The bank manager startled at the sight of him , but she had no breath left for screaming . Doug passed her off to Gloansy , who laid her and the gray-suited assistant manager face-first on the carpeting behind the cages . Gloansy started yanking off their shoes , his voice deepened and filtered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody gets hurt . Doug moved with Jem through the open security door into the lobby . Dez stood beside the front door , hidden from Kenmore Square by the drawn blinds . He checked the window before flashing a blue-gloved thumb , and Doug and Jem crossed the only portion of the lobby visible from the ATM vestibule . Jem unfolded a deep canvas hockey bag on the floor . Doug turned the stubbiest key on the manager 's ring in the night-deposit cabinet lock , and silver plastic deposit bags spilled to the floor like salmon from a cut net . A holiday weekend 's worth . Doug gathered them up five and six at a time , soft bags of cash and checks bundled in deposit slips , dumping the catch into Jem 's open duffel . After raiding the night drop , Doug went on alone to the access door behind the ATM . He matched key to lock , then looked over to the tellers ' cages where Jem had the branch manager on her feet . She looked small without shoes , head down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jem commanded her . " Louder . " She said , staring at the floor , " Four . Five . Seven . Eight . " Doug ignored the choke in her voice and punched the code into the mechanical dial over the key . The door swung open on the ATM closet , and Doug unlatched the feeder and pulled the cash cassette . After the long weekend it was less than half full . He scooped out the sheets of postage stamps as an afterthought and dumped them with the tens and twenties into the bag . Then he flipped the service switch , reloaded the empty cassette , and hustled back past the check-writing counter , running the bag through the open security door to the tellers ' cages . There , he retrieved a small strongbox from a drawer at the head teller 's station . Beneath some dummy forms and a leftover stack of flimsy giveaway 1996 desk calendars was a brown coin envelope containing the cylindrical vault key . They could have been a couple waiting for an elevator , except for the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault door . Jem was holding her close , exploring the curve of her ass through her skirt with the muzzle of his .45 as he whispered something in her ear . Doug made noise coming up behind them and Jem 's gun moved to her hip . Jem said , " She says the time lock 's set for eight eighteen . " The digital clock built into the vault door said 8:17 . They stood for that one minute in silence , Doug behind the manager , listening to her breathing , watching the hands of her self-hugging arms grip her sides . The clock changed to 8:18 . Doug inserted the key over the thick black dial . " We know all about panic codes , " Jem told the manager . " Now open it clean . " Her hand came out stiffly , steadying itself against the cool steel door and leaving a brief , steamy palm print there before starting in on the dial . When she hesitated after the second turn , Doug knew she had made a mistake . " No fucking stalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her skirt . The second time , she made it past the third number of the combination before her nerves betrayed her , her fingers twisting the dial too far . " For Christ ! " said Jem . " I 'm sorry ! " she wailed , half in anger , half in terror . Jem put the gun to her ear . " You have kids ? " She veered away from him , her voice strangled . " No . " " A husband ? Boyfriend ? " " No . " " Christ ! Parents , then . Do you have parents ? Who the fuck can I threaten ? " Doug stepped in , easing Jem 's gun away from her face . " How many attempts before the lock triggers a duress delay ? " She swallowed . " Three . " Doug said , " And how long until it can be opened again after that ? " " I think  --  fifteen minutes . " " Write it down , " said Jem . " Write out the combination , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimacing face in profile , feeling her fear . " You do n't want us here another fifteen minutes . " She considered that a second , then reached fast for the dial , her hand darting like a bird from a cage . Doug caught her wrist , held it firm . " Slow , " he said . " Take your time . Once you start , do not stop . " She wrapped a fist around her thumb . When he released her , her hand went cautiously to the dial . Her fingers obeyed her this time , shaking again only as she approached the final number . The interior clack was audible . Jem spun the locking wheel and the door released , opening on massive hinges , the vault emitting a cool , cottony yawn after a long weekend 's sleep . Doug grabbed the manager 's arm and walked her away . She paused in sight of her office , their entry point , where they had brought the ceiling down on top of her desk . " It 's my birthday , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who put her back with the assistant manager , facedown on the floor . Dez stood near with his scarred mask cocked at a quizzical angle . A radio check , him listening to the unseen wire rising up from inside his jumpsuit collar . " Nothing , " Dez said . The police frequencies were all clear . As a conquest , vault interiors always disappointed Doug . The public access areas such as the safe-deposit rooms were kept polished and showroom clean , but the actual money rooms were no more impressive than utility closets . This vault was no exception . The main cabinet door containing the cash reserves was made of thin metal and fastened with a flimsy desk lock , which Doug busted open in one stroke . Despite the vault 's hard-target exterior , once you were in , you were in . He ignored the heavy racks of rolled coins and instead pulled down stacked bundles of circulated paper currency . The color-coded paper straps that banded the bills told him the denominations at a glance : red for $5s , yellow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful mustard for $100s . He snapped them off as he went , fanning the wads of cash , spot-checking for dye packs and tracers . Four cash-on-wheels teller trucks lined the back of the vault . The top drawers held about $2,500 each , and Doug cleared out all of it except the bait bills , the thin , paper-clipped bundles of twenties laid out at the bottom of each slot . The first drawer was the one tellers drew from during routine transactions , the one they emptied in the event of a stickup . The second drawers were deeper than the first , containing higher denominations for commercial transactions and account closings , more than four times as much money as the first drawers . Doug again emptied each one down to the bait bills . They ignored the safe-deposit room altogether . Opening boxes would have meant drilling each door individually , ten minutes per lock , two locks per box . And even if they did have all day , the Kenmore Square BayBanks branch served a transient community of Boston University students and apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upscale-neighborhood bank , the safe boxes would have been the primary target , since branches in wealthier zip codes usually carry less operating cash , their customers relying on direct deposit rather than paycheck cashing , purchasing things with plastic rather than paper . Dez 's blue palm halted them on the way back . " Asshole at the ATM . " Through the blinds , Doug made out a college kid in sweats playing the machine for allowance money . His card was rejected twice before he bothered to read the service message on the screen . He looked to the door , checking the bank hours printed there , then lifted the customer service phone off the receiver . " Nope , " said Dez . In the middle of this , Doug looked at the manager lying behind the second teller 's cage . He knew things about her . Her name was Claire Keesey . She drove a plum-colored Saturn coupe with a useless rear spoiler and a happy-face bumper sticker that said Breathe ! She lived alone , and when it was warm enough , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby Back Bay Fens . He knew these things because he had been following her , off and on , for weeks . Now , up close , Doug could see the faintly darker roots of her hair , the pale brown she treated honey blond . Her long , black linen skirt outlined her legs to the lacy white feet of her stockings , where jagged stitching across the left heel betrayed a thrifty mending never meant to be seen . She rolled her head along her bent arm , just enough for a peek up at Gloansy , who was hunched over and watching the kid on the ATM phone . Her left leg began to creep toward the teller 's chair . Her foot slipped underneath the counter and out of Doug 's sight , poking around under there , then gliding swiftly back into position , her eyes returning to the crook of her elbow . Doug exhaled slowly . Now he had a problem . The kid in the ATM gave up on the dead telephone and kicked the wall before shoving bitchily through the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag next to the tool bag and the work bag . " Let 's blow , " he said , exactly what Doug wanted to hear . As Gloansy pulled plastic ties from his pockets , and Jem and Dez lifted jugs of Ultra Clorox from the work bag , Doug turned and walked fast down the rear hall into the employee break room . The security equipment sat on wooden shelves there , and the system had tripped , the cameras switched on and recording , a small red light pulsing over the door . Doug stopped all three VCRs and ejected the tapes , then unplugged the system for good measure . He brought the tapes back out to the front and dumped them into the work bag without anyone else seeing . Gloansy had the assistant manager in one of the teller 's chairs , binding the guy 's wrists behind the chair back . Bloody snot painted the assistant manager 's lips and chin . Jem must have flat-nosed him on their way in . Doug lifted the heavy tool bag to his shoulder just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . " Hold it ! " Dez called out . Dez 's finger went to his ear as Jem emerged from the vault , jugs in hand . Gloansy stopped with the manager seated behind the assistant manager now , back-to-back , a tie for her wrists ready in his free hand . Everyone looked at Dez  --  except Doug , who was looking at the manager staring at the floor . Dez said , " Silent alarm call , this address . " Jem looked for Doug . " What the fuck ? " he said , setting down his bleach . " We 're done here anyway , " said Doug . " We 're gone . Let 's go . " Jem drew his pistol , keeping it low at his hip as he approached the seated bankers . " Who did it ? " The manager kept staring at the floor . The assistant manager stared at Jem , a black forelock of hair hanging ragged and sullen over his eyes . " We were gone , " said Jem , pointing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fucking door . " The assistant manager winced at Jem through his hair , eyes watering from the bleach fumes , still sore from his cuffing at the door . Jem locked on him . Wounded defiance was the worst possible play the assistant manager could make . Dez picked up his bleach , hurriedly finishing splashing it around . " Let 's go , " he said . " We 've got ta move , " Doug told Jem . Another few seconds of staring , and the spell was broken . Jem stepped off , relaxing his gun hand , slipping the piece back inside his belt . He was already turning away when the assistant manager said , " Look , no one did any  --  " Jem flew at the man in a blur . The sound of knuckles against temple was like a tray of ice being cracked , Jem holding back nothing . The assistant manager whipped left and slumped over the armrest , the chair tipping and falling onto its side . The assistant manager sagged , still bound to the chair by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away again and again at the defenseless guy 's cheek and jaw . Then Jem stopped and went back for his bleach . Only Doug 's hooking his arm stopped Jem from emptying the jug over the man 's shattered face . That close , Doug could see the pale , nearly white-blue of Jem 's irises within the recesses of the goalie mask , glowing like snow at night . Doug twisted the bleach out of Jem 's hand and told him to load the bags . To Doug 's surprise , Jem did just that . Doug soaked the night drop in the lobby . He soaked the carpet where they had filled the loot bag , jumpy near the windows , expecting sirens . He shook out the jug over the ATM cassette , then returned to the counter . The assistant manager remained hanging off the overturned chair . Only his wheezing told Doug the guy was still alive . The bags were gone . So was the manager . Doug walked to the back , bleach fumes swamping his vision . The bags were stacked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , standing at the rear door , Jem 's hand clamped on the back of the manager 's neck , keeping her from seeing their faces . Dez picked up her brown leather handbag where it had fallen upon entry , shooting Doug a hard look of warning . Doug whipped off his goalie mask , his ski mask still on underneath . " Fuck is this ? " " What if they already got us walled in ? " said Jem , wild . " We need her . " Wheels skidding on alley grit , the work van pulling up outside , and Gloansy , unmasked now , jumping from the wheel to throw the side doors open . Dez started out , two-handing the first duffel bag , swinging it aboard . " Leave her , " Doug commanded . But Jem was already rushing her out to the van . Doug 's ski mask came off , crackling with electricity . Seconds mattered . He carried the work bag into the glaring sunlight and dumped it into the van with a crash . Jem was next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van without her glimpsing his face . Doug took her by the waist , boosted her up , then cut in front of Jem , leaving Jem the third bag . Doug pushed her down the length of the soft bench seat to the windowless wall . " Eyes shut , " he told her , stuffing her head down to her knees . " No noise . " The last bag thudded and the doors slammed and the van lurched up the sharp , ramplike incline , bouncing off the curb and onto the street . Doug pulled his Leatherman from its belt pouch . He opened up the largest blade and tugged the hem of her black jacket taut , cutting into the fabric , then collapsing the blade and tearing off a long strip . She flinched at the noise , shaking but not struggling beneath him . He looked up and they were headed around into Kenmore Square , the red light at the end of Brookline Avenue . The bank was on their right . Doug kept his weight on the manager 's upper back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gloansy said , " What about the switch ? " " Later , " Doug said , through his teeth , sliding the Leatherman back onto his belt . The light turned green and the traffic started forward . Gloansy went easy , bearing east on Commonwealth Avenue . A cruiser was coming , no lights , rolling west toward them , around the bus station in the center island of the square . The cruiser lit up its rack to slow traffic , making a wide U-turn and cutting across behind them , pulling up curbside at the bank . They rolled past the bus station toward the Storrow Drive overpasses . Doug wrapped the fabric twice around the manager 's head , tying it tight in a blindfold . He pulled her halfway up , waving his hand in front of her face , then made a fist and drove it at her , stopping just short of her nose . When she did n't flinch , he let her sit up the rest of the way , then slid to the far end of the bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing off his jumpsuit as if he were trying to shed his own criminal skin .
