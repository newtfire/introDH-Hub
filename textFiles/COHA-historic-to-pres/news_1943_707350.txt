The money , incidentally , had not yet been recovered last night . The arrests , Mr. Goldstein said , " bring to light once more an oldfashioned squeeze-play practiced by racketeers in connivance with strike-breaking detective agencies to force employers , by threat , coercion and extortion to buy protection . There is no room in New York for any racketeer , whether he be feeding an employer or employe . These criminal parasites must be wiped out before they obtain a permanent foothold .

Mr. was aided in the investigation by Assistant Attorneys General Vincent Marsicano and Edwin Lynde and John J. Martin , chief accountant of the State Monopolies Bureau .
