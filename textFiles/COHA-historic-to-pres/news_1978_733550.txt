ISRAELI PREMIER Menacilern Begin has mishandled peace negotiations with Egypt by adopting a " wrong attitude " on two of the key issues , in the view of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Bolick . Bolick is the latest of a number of officials in Israel who have become openly critical of Begin for staking a claim to the occupied West Bank and for pushing Jewish civilian settlements in that area. - Begin maintains that the West Bank is land given to Israel by God in biblical times , AS MAYOR OF Jerusalem for the last 12 years , Austrian-born Kollek , saw that city unified under Israeli rule following the Six-Day ? War in 1967 , and he has worked for understanding with the Arab population of the city . Based on his experience there , he remains confident that the problems between Arabs and Israelis are soluble . Ho was in , Chicago recently to promote his autobiography , " For Jerusalem , " just published by Random House , He was interviewed before the Palestinian commando raid in Israel and last week 's retaliatory raid into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : Q. ? Begin has come under a lot of ern ' . clsm In Israel for his settlements policy and for arguing that United Nations Resolution 242 , which miss for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory , does not apply to the West Bank . What Is your opinion ? A. -- I have a different approach . I do n't think we should keep the West Bank even if someone offers it to us because we do n't need a million Arabs in Israel . We need frontier adjustments . The settlements are a mistake ; what matters is security , not promises that God gave to Abraham , Mr. Begin 's claim is a wrong interpretation of Jewish history . We should accept the eventual return of a major part of the West Bank Ito Arah rulel , without deciding today the final form of government there . Mr. Begin 's position on 242 is a basic change , and I think it 's a wrong attitude . Q , ? Do you see a danger that the peace talks may founder over these Issues ? A. ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's visit to Israel // Q. &; A. Jerusalem mayor hits Begin 's views // was the reaction in Egypt when he re:turned . The enthusiasm ' with which he ' was received showed that the Egyptians ; want peace as much as we do . Things ' can not go ' back to what they- were before his visit . Mr. Begin 's interpretation got the issues in dispute is one the country will not stand for , in my opinion . But I can not imagine that he will . not find a compromise . However , he : needs to change his personal style . Much more so than anywhere else in the ' world , relationships in the Middle East are a matter of style more than substance . It 's like your the U. S. relationship with Latin America , which has often been hurt by a condescending attitude in the past . When Mr. Begin speaks . : to Egyptian officials in a condescending Y'fashion , it becomes a major element in . he negotiations . Q. ? Yon say in your book that political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does that hold true today ? A. ? It has abated a great deal since Ole Sadat visit . Perhaps I 'd better reTeed the book ; I do n't know if I would Say it in those terms now . What I was thying to say was that , after the Six-Day ; ' War , so many people in Israel were convinced of our strength that they saw things out of focus . We are a small Country , with a lot of skills.and talents , but still only a country of 3 million pedtile . The Arabs are 100 million , and with oil . We ca n't behave as if this is our World and we run it . There are some people around who have not learned this lesson . Q. ? How do you assess the Carter administration 's handling of Middle East policy , both In terms of the peace negotiations and of the package deal that teas recently proposed for selling aircraft to Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and Israel ? 4 ? There are ups and downs . I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role for the Palestinians in determining their future , but no independent Palestinian state is satisfactory to us , But no one can understand this business of the linking of the planes ; that is , saying that Israel can not have them unless Saudi Arabia and Egypt get some , too . One should judge these things on their merits . What does one have to do with the other ? Q. ? You have a lot of close contacts with Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank , How do you feel about the Palestine Liberation Organization ? A. ? There are a million Palestinians in Palestine whose main feeling toward the PLO is one of fear . Between 1936 and 1939 , the mufti of Jerusalem , Haj Amin El-Husseini , was responsible for the killing of 6,000 Arabs by Arabs in terrorism to establish a monolithic attitude . People have n't forgotten , that . Hussein ! was the forerunner of the PLO . You would have the greatest exodus of Arabs from Jerusalem if the PLO came there . They have learned what free expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East where there is a free Arab press . Even if the PL ( : ' was identical with the Palestinians , w could n't con ? template having someonethostile on our borders who wants to bring the Russians in . Why should we hand over the Palestinians to a small terrorist group ? Q. ? What solution do you see for Jerusalem , in terms of administration of the city , access to the holy places , and na ( tonality of the Arab population of the city ? A. ? We have done a few things in the city already which have shown which way things can go . The Arabs have remained Jordanian citizens , although we offered them citizenship . Only a couple of hundred applied , and we did n't encourage them to accept Israeli citizenship . They have free passage back and forth over the Jordan River , so they are not cut off from the Arab world . Arab edutation is run according to the curriculum approved in Jordan , so youngsters can go directly to Arab universities . We have introduced a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far beyond anything that existed before . There is an Arab theater in Jerusalem for the first time . The Temple MO/Mt is under Arab administration and not in , terfered with by us . The Christian holy places are More respectfully treated than they ? ever were . You no longer hear the Vatican talking about internationalization . ' When the idea was first mooted , it would have meant ' internationalization under the control of Christian countries , But now , with the rise of the Third World to prominence in the United Nations , things , have changed . Internationalization wealth:man the holy . places Would be controlled by representatives ranging from Albania to ldi Amin . As for administration of the city , you could have independent boroughs , as in London where the boroughs have wider powers than they do in New York . We might be willing to , let an Arab agency be responsible for issuing visas for Arabs to Jerusalem so they wo n't be dependent on us . We are ready to divest ourselves of these elements of sovereignty . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be like cutting up any human body ,
