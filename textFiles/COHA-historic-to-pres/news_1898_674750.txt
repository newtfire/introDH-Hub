There is all the difference between mediation and intervention that there is between friendly advice and active meddling . The mediation which the Queen Regent of Spain has requested from the various Governments of Europe , if confined within proper limits , is in reality a matter with which we need not have anything to do . It may take the form of friendly advice from these Governments to Spain as to a course which she could follow when advised to do so , and could not with comfort or safety adopt on her own motion . Such action by European Governments could not be regarded by our own as in any sense offensive or impertinent . It might tend to the preservation of peace , for which , so long as the one condition of lasting peace is secured . we should be profoundly thankful . There have been several instances of offers of mediation from friendly powers in our own history ; brief reference to them will show clearly what the process really is , and the limitations recognized regarding it . Two of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset of the war of 1812 and accepted by us , but declined by England . Ten years later another was made as to a dispute , which had become threatening , over a clause of the Treaty of Ghen+ ; it was accepted by both sides and an adjustment was reached . In 1847 England offered mediation in the trouble with Mexico , but neither party accepted it . During our civil war the Emperor of Russia offered mediation , with the understanding that the integrity of the Union should be maintained . He was cordially thanked , but that was all that came of it . France later proposed joint mediation to Great Britain and Russia ; neither acquiesced , the Russian Government expressly giving as its reason that a joint proposition would appear to the United States as a form of pressure . Early in 1863 , when the fortunes of war seemed going against the Union , France proposed mediation on her own account , and was promptly told that to insist would be taken to be unfriendly . Thus it will be seen that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion of the Government to which it is offered , and to decline it is in no sense a violation of duty or even of courtesy . The course of the Government receiving the proposition is guided solely by its own conception of its own rights and interests . In the present situation , when the United States declares that the withdrawal of ' Spain from Cuba is ' essential to ' permanent friendly relations between the two Governments , it is plain that mediation , if proposed . must be considered in the light of that policy . If we are determined and prepared to maintain it , then mediation can only be directed toward the manner in which , and the terms on which , the withdrawal of Spain can be carried out , and as to these matters the responsibility primarily lies with Spain . It is upon Spain , therefore , that the influence of the mediators must be exerted . And obviously that influence may be very helpful . It is impossible that Spanish statesmen do not see that ultimately Cuba must be given up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present trouble with the United States arose . Military force , taxing the utmost resources in men and money of the kingdom , had been exerted for three years entirely in vain . The efforts which were manifestly unsuccessful without intervention by the United States are by that intervention ' made utterly futile . But it is held by Spanish statesmen and freely avowed that the recognition of this fact and the abandonment of Cuba in consequence would entail not merely the downfall of the Ministry , but the ruin of the dynasty , and plunge the nation into , revolution . This may or may not be true . We are not in a position to form a safe judgment . But If it be true , then the advice of powerful and friendly European Governments might make withdrawal from Cuba practicable without the revolution that is feared under other conditions . That is the only objective to which " friendly Offices ' ? can at present be directed with any hope of effect .                @ @ @ @ @
