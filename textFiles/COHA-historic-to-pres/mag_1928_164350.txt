Amsterdam is the city of drab workmen who cut and polish brightest diamonds , the home of landlubbing watermen who pole barges along slow canals , the habitat of buxom and sensible stenographers who pedal to work each morning upon thousands of bicycles . Amsterdam , in short , is the last place where one would expect to hear-during the decent forenoon hours , and from a stately mansion-a sequence of revolver shots . <P> The mansion where bullets pinged and splintered , last week , was that of socially elect Mynheer and Mevrouw Van Eeghen . Servants rushed in to find him shot dead , and her unconscious from a bullet wound in the head . A single revolver lay smoking on the floor . . . . <P> Soon Dutch newshawks gave the tragedy world interest by rushing off to scribble that Mevrouw Van Eeghen is the niece of mighty Sir Henri Deterding , Director General of the internationally potent Royal Dutch Shell ( Oil ) Group . Shrewder newshawks stressed Mevrouw Van Eeghen 's unique distinction ; she was , last week , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar business woman in the U. S. one must search out pretty , audacious Miss Peggy Cleary of Manhattan ( TIME , April 2 ) , the spinster-stockholder who bid $375,000 , last fortnight , in an effort to obtain a seat on the New York Stock Exchange . In Amsterdam the buzz of tickers ceased to have meaning , last week , for Mevrouw Van Eeghen . Removed to a hospital , she lay at first unconscious , and later sphinxlike by advice of her attorneys . Her husband , forgotten by the press , had been a rich , respected rubber merchant of the firm of Matthes &; Bormeester . <P> In London close-lipped Sir Henri Deterding said : " I can throw no light upon this sad affair . " <P> <P> Paradoxically light was being thrown upon Sir Henri himself , last week , from Manhattan . There President Richard Airey of the Asiatic Petroleum Co. , a Royal Dutch subsidiary , declared : " I wish to dispel a popular illusion that Sir Henri Deterding has changed his nationality from Dutch to British . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he prefers to be known by his British title . . . but he has never changed his nationality . . . . <P> " Further it should be pointed out that the Charter of the Royal Dutch Co. requires that all its officers and directors be Dutch subjects . . . . " <P> Commenting further , Mr. Airey denied that the British Government owns any share in Royal Dutch , but stated his belief that it owns 56% of the common stock of the rival Anglo-Persian Oil Company .
