SO FAR , I HAVE BEEN ABLE to keep my enthusiasm for the Nixon Administration under control . The personalities of both the President and Our Spiro fail to charm me . In fact , for the past year I have kept a bottle of Gelusil beside the television set , because my stomach begins to churn automatically whenever either of them makes a speech . Moreover , I am irreconcilably opposed to many of their policies , from the Southern strategy to the SST . Could be that I am a mite prejudiced . So it comes hard for me to have to admit that the Administration might be doing something right . Nevertheless it is my duty as a reporter to note that it now is up to something pretty interesting ? something which has scarcely been mentioned in the news media . One eiivlanation for this silence is that Nixon &; Cohorts have in this case been trying to do good as inconspicuously as possible , for canny reasons . Another is that most Washington newsmen , for causes mentioned here a few months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than in the prosaic arts-andcrafts of government . Still , it seems odd to me that pracically nobody has noticed how drastically the Administration is changing the very structure of government . When Truman remodeled the White House porch , the press flew into a tizzy . But when Nixon starts to remodel the framework of the federal system , in ways which may well affect the lives of all of us , hardly anybody twitches an eyebrow . What is even more curious , some of his purposes seem identical with those of both the New Left and Lyndon Johnson . For example , he is trying to decentralize the bureaucracy ? to move a big share of decision-making out of Washington , and closer to kcal communities . In one significant case he appropriated a scheme which was developed under the Johnson regime , but abandoned because LBJ felt that in his last months in office he did not have 22 enough political clout to get away with it . Yet Nixon picked up the plan during his first weeks in the White House , and issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up till now , miraculously , it has n't provoked an angry murmur ? probably because Congressional and other vested interests have n't yet grasped its implications . IT IS STILL TOO EARLY to tell how this particular reform will work out . At the very least , it seems likely to improve the efficiency of government . At the most it could ? over a period of years develop into a new pattern of government , which was familiar to the ancient Romans but has never been tried in this country . In the latter case , we might wake up on some distant morning to discover the nation divided into ten provinces , each directed by a proconsul responsible to the President , and charged with responsibilities which both the states and Washington previously had been handling badly or not at all . The boundaries of these provinces already have been laid down , their capitals have been established , and this September they began to do business , in a tentative and limited kind of way . To be sure , everybody connected with the scheme avoids with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informants will be provoked with me for using terms which could touch off alarm hells on Capitol hill . They prefer to speak , not of provinces , but of " federal regions " with " regional headquarters " ? familiar names which upset nobody . Moreover , the writ of the " regional councils " and their " directors " does not yet run very far ; they are supposed to " coordinate " rather than rule . Maybe it will never come to anything more than that . Perhaps , indeed , the undertaking will bog down in bureaucratic lethargy and confusion , as have so many earlier efforts to " coordinate " the snakes ' nest of federal and local agencies . This time , however , I have a hunch that there is at least a chance that the pressures of necessity and public dis content may shove the new regions in the opposite direction ? into a slow evolution toward a significant , and peculiarly American , experiment in provincial government . T HE ONE THING THAT practically everybody in this fretfully divided country seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That probably is the only proposition which could gain the assent of William Buckley , John W. Gardner , and Mark Rudd . For at all levels , from city hall to the White House , government evidently is incapable of doing the things its citizens expect . It ca n't educate the kids who need it most . It ca n't clean up the water we drink and the air we breathe . It ca n't solve the housing shortage . It ca n't keep the railroads running , or unsnarl our traffic jams , or stop the migration of poor people from farms to overcrowded cities . It ca n't train them for jobs once they get there . It ca n't stop the crime rate from climbing like an Apollo rocket , or even build decent jails to lock up the criminals when it catches them . It ca n't ? oh , well , you know the litany , too . . Every day we get plenty of explanations for these failures . Mark Rudd , before he disappeared underground , proclaimed that we were witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blames the feckless incompetence of the Liberal Establishment which has been running things ( even if it does n't realize it ) for far too long . Nearly everyone , except Spiro and the shrinking remnants of his Noisy Minority , believes we an spending too much money on a hatefu war , and not enough on the troublo in our own kitchen . Edward Banfielc of Harvard in his brilliantly unfash ionable book , The Unheavenly City argues that we have come to expec government to do far more than an : government actually can do ? and tit fact that England , Russia , China , an , Cuba are plagued by much the sam array of woes , from smog to juvenil delinquency , seems to bear him out . Granted that the human condition is less than heavenly , and always has been , our government does n't really have to be as copeless as it is now . One of its faults is that it was not designed to do the things we demand of it ? so a careful job of redesigning , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it work a good deal better . Another problem is the difficulty of getting first-rate men to work in the middle ranks of government . When they can be recruited , they seldom stay long ? not simply because the pay is not competitive with executive salaries on the outside , but because of frustration . If the management structure can be redesigned so that they waste less time struggling with red tape and bickering with other agencies , then good people should be more willing to enlist for public service . mo ONE WHO INSPECTS the working I machinery of government closely , as I have been doing for the past few years , it sometimes is hard to believe that it was ever designed at all . If a corporation were organized like the federal Establishment , it would go bankrupt in a week . During the past two decades , and especially during the Johnson Admin. istration , hundreds of new programs were created to help cure a wide variety of social problems . Nobody knows precisely how many such programs there are , but the number certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-intentioned . They were meant to feed hungry people , to clear slums , build sewage plants , retrain unskilled workers , upgrade police departments , improve highways , finance better schools , and scores of other nice things . To accomplish all this , the federal ; overnment usually offered money ( $27 A:Ilion this fiscal year ) to the states and their local communities , which vere then expected to do the actual vork . Each offer had a lot of strings . ttached ? and these too were wellntentioned . To get money for housing , or example , or an industrial park or new water system , a town had to ome up with a comprehensive plan , nil a sheaf of documents showing just ow each project fitted into this plan . also had to make frequent reports , ) Washington could see how the money as being spent , and make sure that of too much of it was being wasted ! . stolen . Dandy ideas , these ? or so it seemed THE EASY CHAIR must be said that he did make almoE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A James L. Sundquist points out in hi recent book , Making Federalism Wort for a time 1.13J was appointing a " cc ordinator of the month . " But since h usually named a Cabinet officer to " cc ordinate " other Cabinet officers , an , gave him little authority to do any thing but appeal to the good will of hi jealous coequals , that never worked Indeed , all those coordinators merel ? cluttered up the scene still further . Under these circumstances , an el eeptionally vigorous governor or may o now and then would try to coordinat the many arms and legs of the federa government itself , since Washingto plainly was incapable of doing st When my friend Ned Breathitt wa Governor of Kentucky , he worked au a sound and imaginative plan to re juvenate his state . Where he saw a : urgent need for new housing , he hope , to get the financing from the Depart ment of Housing and Urban Develot merit . Then he would go to Heald-Education , and Welfare for the school the project would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewers an water supply ; at least five differer agencies , he found , were authorized t help build such facilities , so he had t shop around to see where he could gc the best deal .

Such an undertaking turned out t be a lot more strenuous than Breathii had anticipated . Nearly all these federt agencies had field offices which wee supposed to help state and local official in making out applications and meetin requirements . But none of these , as happened , were in Kentucky . To tal to HUD , the Governor had to go I Atlanta . The HEW regional office we in Raleigh . North Carolina . The Labc Department people he had to see nest ( in Chicago . The Small Business A. ministration office was in Philadelphi and OED 's " field office " for his regic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to get these regional representatives togeth in one room somewhere , so he cou explain his undertaking , reach sor common understanding on what w feasible , and get a commitment fro each agency on how its piece of mon Coast Guard or the Forest Service , to name only a couple , need be fitted into the pattern . Thanks to careful planning , the scheme was put into operation this fall ith a minimum of commotion . Only about 2,300 federal employees had to move to the new headquarters cities . The must painful shift was that of some 420 HEW people from Charlottesville , Virginia , to Philadelphia : but the trauma was eased by compensating Charlottesville with a military installation . To my surprise , I found that it has not been necessary to put up new federal buildings in the provincial capitals ; the new concentrations of staff have been accommodated by reshuffling existing offices and renting some space in privately owned buildings . I was also surprised to discover that all this regrouping is being carried through on schedule and should be virtually complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council , made up of the ranking field officers of each of the agencies , is in operation in every one of the regional headquarters . It selects its own chairman , and meets as often as necessary to thrash out mutual problems . If Ned Breathitt were Governor of Kentucky today , he could meet all those people he needed to see in one place : Atlanta , Georgia . So far there is no resident representative of the President at regional headquarters , to knock heads together when necessary and make sure that White House policy is consistently carried out . But the Budget Bureau does have a " deskman " for each region , who pays frequent visits to the field . He is expected to mediate bureaucratic hassles on the spot , whenever possible , and to report hack to Washington on the way each agency is doing its job . An executive in regional headquarters might easily leap to the conclusion . hat his future in the federal service could depend largely on the deskman 's valuation .
