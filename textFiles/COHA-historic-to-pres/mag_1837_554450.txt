IT is a dangerous thing to print a single oration ; much more so , a volume of them . The declamatory fervor , which is essential to the success of a spoken discourse , offends the taste of the fastidious reader in his closet , coldly unravelling the flowery web , whose vivid hues will not bear too close an examination . Words , too , may be printed ; but who can print the electric language of the human eye , the expressive tones of the human voice ? Who can convey to the reader not only the sentences and paragraphs of a discourse , but the glance and the gesture , which enforced them ? Who can put upon paper , the skilful inflections and appropriate movements , which gave dignity to a commonplace observation , and effect to a tawdry flourish ? which broke the fall of a flat sentence , and made old truths sound almost as good as new Of the many discourses and orations , which , in our speechmaking country , every season sends fluttering forth from the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how few are read , and of those few , which are read , how few are remembered . A presentation copy is , in most cases , a serious thing to a conscientious man ; for this involves the necessity of reading , and , if possible , of praising , which sometimes awakens a painful struggle between a sense of duty and a sense of politeness . We have known individuals , who avoided a difficulty of this kind , by writing their letter of acknowledgment beforehand , in which they expressed an intention of reading and an expectation of being gratified . The foregoing observations are suggested by that fruitful mother of associations , the principle of contrast ; for the orations of Mr. Everett are splendid exceptions to a general rule . The book before us is one of those , which are the admiration // of readers and the despair of critics . We believe it was Voltaire who said of some favorite work , that he could praise it in no other way , than by writing at the bottom of every page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the brief and comprehensive criticism , which this volume deserves . Our wonder , no less than our delight , is awakened by the prodigious fertility of mind which it displays , and the copious stores from which its contents have been drawn . Most of our scholars and men of letters publish , in the course of their lives , half a dozen discourses and orations , more or less , hut within the covers of this volume , there are no less than twenty-seven lectures , speeches , and orations , all the work of eleven years ; and the work too , not of one , who , in the golden light of leisure can devote the heart and strength of continuous and uninterrupted days to his task , hut the superadded efforts of a crowded life , and performed in those chance hours which can be gleaned from duties and engagements , which would seem to be enough to demand and justify exclusive devotion to themselves . But there are nowhere any indications of weariness and exhaustion ; much less , of self-repetition . The writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest efforts , with unbroken vigor and undiminished vivacity . Sated , as he must have become , with his employment , nothing seems to have been extorted from a worn-out brain , by the iron scourge of a despotic xviii ; but every thing has , apparently , been thrown off with the easy alacrity of one , who has just awaked to the consciousness of intellectual wealth . The fountain is never turbid , but its last flowings are as fresh and clear , as its " first sprightly runnings . " We can hardly help regretting that so much intellectual power has been , - we will not say wasted ,  --  but bestowed upon these occasional efforts , when Mr. Everett might have done so much more for his own fame , by devoting his energies to a sin9e and continuous work . But when we recollect the crowded audiences that have listened with delight to these discourses , when flowing from the orator 's lips , and embellished by his beautiful elocution , and who will renew the same glow of pleasure in reading them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great charm of Mr. Everett 's orations consists , not so much in any single and strongly developed intellectual trait , as in that symmetry and finish , which , on every page , give token of the richly-endowed and thorough scholar . The natural // movements of his mind are full of grace ; and the most indifferent sentence which falls from his pen has that simple elegance , which it is as diflicult to define as it is easy to perceive . His level passages are never tame , and his fine ones are never superfine . His style , with matchless flexibility , rises and falls with his subject , and is alternately , easy , vivid , elevated , ornamental or picturesque , adapting itself to the dominant mood of the mind , as an instrument resl ) onds to the touch of a master 's hand . His knowledge is so extensive , and the field of his allusions so wide , that the most familiar views , in passing through his hands , gather such a halo of luminous illustrations , that their likeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially , in reading these orations , do we perceive the power which comes from an accurate knowledge of history . No man wields an historical argument with more skill ; no one is more fruitful in effective historical parallels and applications . He has , in perfection , the historical eye , if we may so speak ; the power of running over an epoch and seizing upon its characteristic expression , and of distinguishing the events by which that expression is most decidedly manifested . His Phi Beta Kappa oration ( the one delivered at Cambridge in 1824 , ) is a signal instance of his success in this respect . Whatever may be thought of the soundness of its positions , no one can doubt the ability with which they are maintained , and the ingenuity and admirable rhetorical skill , with which the orator presses into his service the long record of the past , to enforce and defend them . The same remarks apply , also , to his Plymouth oration , and indeed , in a greater or less degree , to nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comprehensive grasp and power of generalization , which are the attributes of almost all superior minds , hut he has all the minute accuracy of a chronicler , understands perfectly the significance and efficacy of facts and details , and uses them with great skill and success . His picturesque narrative is one of the most striking of his accomplishments . With what vividness does he make a long procession of events pass before our eyes , as in his Lexington , Concord , and Bloody Brook addresses , marshalling every thing into its proper place , without confusion or crowding ! How agreeably he relates a familiar incident , like the anecdote of the dispersion of the London mob , in his Cambridge Fourth of July oration , ( page 106 of the present volume . ) With what living // hues he paints a scene like that of ' the death-bed of Copernicus , in the Address before the Literary Societies of Amherst College , ( page 576 of the volume . ) In the following paragraph from the Plymouth address , with what almost painful intenseness he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their voyage and at their landing . " Methinks I see it now , that one solitary , adventurous vessel , the Mayflower of a forlorn hope , freighted with the prospects of a future state , and hound across the unknown sea . I behold it pursuing , with a thousand misgivings , the uncertain , the tedious voyage . Suns rise and set , and weeks and months pass , and winter surprises them on the deep , but brings them not the sight of the wished-for shore . I see them now scantily supplied with provisions , crowded almost to suffocation in their ill-stored prison , delayed by calms , pursuing a circuitous route ; - and now driven in fury before the raging tempest , on the high and giddy waves . The awful voice of the storm howls through the rigging . The laboring masts seem straining from their base ; - the dismal sound of the pumps is heard ; - the ship leaps , as it were , madly , from billow to billow ; - the ocean breaks , and settles with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadening weight against the staggered vessel . I see them , escaped from these perils , pursuing their all but desperate undertaking , and landed at last , after a five months ' passage , on the ice-clad rocks of Plymouth , - weak and weary from the voyage , - poorly armed , scantily provisioned , depending on the charity of their ship-master for a ( Iraft of beer on board , drinking nothing but water on shore , - without shelter , - without means , surrounded by hostile tribes . Shut now the volume of history , and tell me , on any principle of human probability , what shall be the fate of this handful of adventurers . Tell me , man of military science , in how many months were they all swept off by the thirty savage tribes , enumerated within the early limits of NeWEngland ? Tell me , politician , how long did this shadow of a colony , on which your conventions and treaties had not smiled , languish on the distant coast ? Student of history , compare for me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other times , and find the parallel of this . Was it the winter 's storm , beating upon the houseless heads of women and children ; was it hard labor and spare meals ; - was it disease ,  --  was it the tornahawk ,  --  was it the deep malady of a blighted hope , a ruined enterprise , and a broken heart , aching in its last moments , at the recollection of the loved and left , beyond the sea ; was it some , or all of these united , that hurried // this forsaken company to their melancholy fate ?  --  and is it possible , that neither of these causes , that not all combined , were able to blast this bud of hope ? Is it possible , that from a beginning so feeble , so frail , so worthy , not so much of admirahon as of pity , there has gone forth a progress so steady , a growth so wonderful , a reality so important , a promise yet to be fulfilled , so glorio us ? " - pp.6O- 6*2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the beauty and power of the foregoing paragraph constrain us to resume the subject . It is doubtless an artificial style ; that is to say , a style formed and elaborated by assiduous care , and polished by a taste as sensitive as a blind man 's touch ; and if it does not snatch a grace beyond the reach of art , it certainly snatches all that are within its reach . But , be this as it may , the skilful restjdt contains no internal evidence of the laborious process by which it was attained , and the orator has reached the highest triumph of art , by so effectually hiding it from observation . His style appears to us a nearly perfect specimen of a rhetorical and ornamental one . Certainly , it is so , if the just definition of a good style be , proper words in proper places . He is as careful to select the right word , as a workman in Mosaic is to pick out the exact shade of color which he requires ; and it would be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Take , for instance , the following sentence contained in the above extract . " The laboring masts seem straining from their base. ; - the dismal sound of the pumps is heard ; - the ship leaps , as it were , madly , from billow to billow ; - the ocean breaks , and settles with engulphing floods over the floating deck , and beats , with deadening weight , against the staggered vessel . " What speaking pictures are presented to the eye by these very words ; " the dismal sound , " " the engulpliing floods , " " the floating deck , " " deadening weight , " " the staggered vessel " ; and how impossible it would be to substitute more expressive ones in their places . Let no man underrate this minuteness of verbal criticism , as finical and unmanly . The characteristic of a good style in prose or poetry , is , that it will bear ( lissection . Fineness of polish is , next to indestructibleness of material , the best specific against the corroding influences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of constant pleasure to his readers , even to those who are charmed by it unconsciously to themselves . His orations // abound with those delicious cadences , which thrill through the veins like a strain of fine music , and cling spontaneously to the memory . Where can we find the English language moulded into more graceful forms , than in such sentences as these ? " They do not create , they obey the Spirit of the Age ; the serene and beautiful spirit , descended from the highest heaven of liberty , who laughs at our little preconceptions , and , with the breath of his mouth , sweeps before him the men and the nations , that cross his path . " - p. 25 . " Greece cries to us , by the convulsed lips of her poisoned , dying Demosthenes ; and Rome pleads with us , in the mute persuasioa of her mangled Tully. " - p. 37 . " The sound of my native language beyond the sea , is a music to my ear , beyond the richest strains of Tuscan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They come from the embattled cliffs of Abraham ; they start from the heaving sods of Bunker 's Hill ; they gather from the blazing lines of Saratoga and Yorktown ; from the blooddyed waters of the Brandywine ; from the dreary snows of Valley Forge , and all the hard fought fields of the war . " - p. 101 . " No vineyards , as now , clothed our inhospitable hill-sides ; . no blooming orchards , as at the present day , wore the livery of Eden , and loaded the breeze with sweet odors ; no rich pas-. tures , nor waving crops , stretched beneath the eye , along the wayside , from village to village , as if Nature had been spreading her halls with a carpet , fit to be pressed by the footsteps of her descending God " - p. 229 . " The memory of their great men of old went before them to battle , and scattered dismay in the ranks of the barbarous foe , as he moved , like Satan in hell , with uneasy steps , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have not these future billows , on which navies are soon to be tossed , in which the great monsters of the deep will disport themselves , been borne aloft on the bosom of a fleecy cloud , - chased by a breeze , - with scarce enough of substance to catch the hues of a sunbeam ; and have they not descended , sometimes indeed , in drenching rains , - but far more diffusively in dew-drops , and gentle showers , arid feathery snows , over the expanse of a continent , and been gathered successively into the slender rill , the brook , the placid stream , till they grew , at last , into the mighty river , pouring down his tributary floods into the unfathomed ocean * " - pp. 407 , 408. // The extracts which we have made from Mr. Everett 's volume , are specimens of that magnificent declamation which is one of his most obvious and striking characteristics ; but , in order to appreciate the versatility of his powers , one should read his discourses of a sober and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Party , his address before the Massachusetts Agricultural Society , and his speech on the subject of the Western Rail-road . In these , we shall find that the same person who can so move and thrill us when he has his " singing robes and garlands about him , " can put them off , and give us familiar instruction and plain , practical advice , as if he had never spurned the damp earth with his rhetorical wings . His singular power of illustration enables him to give dignity to the lowest , and interest to the driest subject , while that unerring taste , which , in his highest flights , insures him temperance and smoothness , preserves him from the unpardonable sin of being heavy , commonplace , and prosaic . The extent of his knowledge in common things , and his minute power of observation , are quite remarkable in one , who has spent so much time in his study , and is so familiar with books . His brilliant intellectual accomplishments , and his fine taste , rest upon a granite foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mechanics upon their own ground , and tell them something they did not know before . His retentive memory , and copious stores of all kinds of information , enable him to support every position by an imposing array of facts , and leave no room for that distrust , which practical men are apt to entertain of the views and opinions of scholars and thinkers . The following extract from his speech on the subject of the Western Rail-road , may be adduced as a specimen of his powers in this respect . " Bat the great thing wanting to the prosperity of Massachusetts is COMMUNICATION WITH THE WEST . The internal commerce of this country is prodigious ; and of all that part which is accessible to us , on the present system of communication , we have an ample share . With the South , we have , in our freighting and coasting trade , every thing that can be asked . With the South-West , in reference to all that part of commerce which is calculated to seek the route by sea to New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intercourse already established in this way , with the whole region drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries , is most extensive , various , and muta // ally profitable . In ascending the Mississippi and its tributaries , in lS*29 , on which occasion I was on board several boats , I continually saw casks , packages , and bales , in all of them , which I knew came from New England , by their marks ,  --  by the mode of doing up , - by a certain indescribable something , in which to a true Yankee eye there is no mistake . A distinguished gentleman , of Pittsburgh , told me there was a regular battle between the Boston nails and the Pittsburgh nails , on the Ohio river ; - the Boston nails coming all the way round , and the Pittsburgh made on the spot , from Juniata iron ; and that , though the Pittsburgh nails sometimes fought their way ( lown the river to Louisville , the Bostonians , at times , had driven them up as far as Wheeling . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had , in the year preceding , imported two thousand barrels of pickled mackerel ; and I think I did not enter a public house in the West , to take a meal , morning , noon , or night , without seeing a pickled mackerel on the table . I remember , a year or two ago , that one of my neighbours from Charlestown , who had emigrated to the northwest corner of Arkansas , - a spot not then even laid out into counties , - told me , that in that remote region , - the I st foothold of civilization , where you have but one more step to make , to reach the domain of the wild Indian and the buffalo , - a settler did not think himself well accoutred , without a Leominster axe . But , give him that , - give him , Sir , that weapon which has brought a wider realm into the pale of civilization , than the sword of C*sar or the sceptre of Justinian ,  --  give him a narrow Yankee axe , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a season ; though I shrewdly suspect , without the least disparagement of emigrants from other quarters , that after sending the Yankee axe into the country , the best way to give it full effect would he to send a little Yankee bone and sinew , to facilitate its use . " But , Sir , though by the way of New Orleans we have a considerable trade with the South-West , there is a vast region , which that channel does not reach . A direct communication is greatly wanted . This is THE want , daily becoming more serious , and which must be supplied . The destinies of the country , if I may use a language which sounds rather mystical , but which every one , I believe , understands , - the destinies of the country run East and West . Intercourse between the mighty interior West and the seacoast , is the great principle of our commercial prosperity and political strength . Nature , iii the aggregate , has done every thing that could be desired , to promote this intercourse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as the single State of Massachusetts is concerned , // the course of the rivers from North to South , and of the mountains between which they flow , deprives us of the share of the benefits of this intercourse which we should otherwise enjoy . And this operation of natural causes has been aided by several important works of artificial communication , enumerated in the able report of the committee . The consequence is , that a very considerable part of the territory of Massachusetts has its commercial interests in one direction , and its political and social relations in another ; so much so , that , as we all , I am sure , heard with pain from the distinguished gentleman from Springfield , ( Mr. Calhoun , ) the feeling of State pride , which ought of all feelings that end in temporal affairs , to be among the dearest and deepest in the bosom of a Massachusetts man , was daily growing weaker among the people of one of the most intelligent and substantial portions of the State . " This commercial alienation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens of Boston are not generally aware of . The entire region west of the hills of Berkshire communicates with New York through the hudson , - and the whole valley of the Connecticut , in and out of Massachusetts , communicates with Long Island Sound . I am afraid to say , in how large a part of Massachusetts I think a complete non-intercourse reigns with the capital ; but I will state to you a fact , that lately fell beneath my personal observation . Having occasiOIi , last week , to go to Deerfield I took the north road from Worcester , through Templeton , Athol , and the country watered by Miller 's river . If there is a spot in Massachusetts where one would feel himself entrenched , shut up , land-locked , in the very hoso of the Commonwealth , Athol Green , surrounded with its risin* , grounds , is that spot . And what , Mr. President , do you think I saw ? We had scarce driven out of the village , arid were making our way along through South Oran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two wagons straining up a hill , - the horses ' heads to the east , - the wagons laden with crates , casks , and bales of foreign merchandise , which had come from Liverpool , by the way of Hartford , from New York ! I hold that , Sir , a little too much for a Massachusetts man to contemplate without pain . " Now , Mr. President , this is the matter which we wish to put to rights . We do not wish to deprive New York of her trade ; but to regain our own . It is the object of this meeting to remedy principally this evil . To open a great route of communication between the East and the West , by means of a railroad from Boston to Albany , which with lateral routes , afterwards to be constructed , shall replace Boston in its natural position toward the trade of the interior . // " And here , perhaps , we shall be met by the general vague objection , that it is impossible , by artificial works , to divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are two kinds of natural channels , - one sort made directly by the hand which made the world ; the other , constructed by man , in the intelligent exercise of the powers which his Creator has given him . It is as natural for a civilized man to make a rail-way or canal , as for a savage to descend a river in a bark canoe , or to cross from one fishing-place to another , by a path through the woods . " The city of New York , no doubt , owes much to the noble river that unites her to Albany ; but she owes vastly more to her great artificial works of internal communication . The Hudson and the Mohawk , of themselves , unaided by art , so far from gathering in the commerce of the far West , would not monopo* lize that of one half the region west of Albany , within the State of New York . How far is it from the head waters of the eastern branch of the Susquehannah , in Otsego lake , to the Mohawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high grounds , that overlook Harrisburgh in Pennsylvania , at a season of the year before the Hudson was open , and seen the rafts , the fiatboats , the canoes , the batteaux , the craft of undescribed shapes and unutterable names , following each other , on the broad bosom of the Susquehannah , from morning to night , bearing the produce of the interior of New York , to a market in Chesapeake Bay The same holds of the southwestern corner of New York , which naturally is drained by the tributaries of the Ohio . I recollect that at New Orleans , I saw a flat-bottomed boat loaded with shingles . I asked its steersman whence he came . He answered , from Glean . Perhaps I ought to be ashamed to confess , that , at that time , I did not know where Glean was . I found , to my astonishment , it was a settlement in Cattaraugus county , New York , on the Alle*hany river , a hundred and seventy or eighty miles northeast of Pittsburgh ! But , Sir , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has constructed her great artificial works . In this respect , Massachusetts is naturally little , if any , worse off than Ne*v York . If New York has a great navigable river , Massa husetts has , what New York wants , a vast seacoast . What both wanted was a great line of artificial communication , running inward to the West . New York has constructed hers , and has other mighty works of the same character in progress ; and all that Massachusetts needs is , by a work of very moderate extent , not merely to recover the trade of her own territory . bL4 // to acquire a fair share , a large , a growing share , of the commerce of the boundless West . " - pp. 629- 632 . If we were called upon to assign the palm of superiority to ' any one of the discourses in this volume , we should find it a difficult task . Some of them we like for one kind of excellence , and some for another ; and some of his shorter and apparently less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his longer and more elaborate productions . His Phi Beta Kappa oration , delivered at Cambridge in 1824 , is the most celebrated of his occasional discourses , and probably comprehends the greatest amount of intellectual power . In point of style , argument , and illustration , it is lavish and splendid in the highest degree , and it contains passages which may safely challenge a comparison with any thing of the kind in the English language . The concluding paragraphs are magnificent , stirring the blood like the sound of a trumpet ; and the closing one , the well-known address to Lafayette , is full of a simple grandeur , resembling the life and character of the eminent man , of whom , and to whom , it was spoken . The full and ripe scholarship , too , displayed in this discourse , is riot among the least of its charms . But with all its various and admirable merits , it is open to the criticism of hem0 the production of a rhetorician , rather than a philosopher ; an advocate rather than a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orator 's views , than either truth or history will warrant . We may venture to assert , however , without much fear of contradiction , that this oration , together with those delivered at Plymouth and at Concord , ( being the first three in the volume , ) stand in the first rank of his occasional productions . They were his earliest efforts , and they are characterized by a richness and vigor of conception , a fulness of illustration and a luxuriance of imagery , not surpassed , if equalled , by any of his later ones . But it is altogether unnecessary to assign any relative rank to th6se discourses . We like to think of the volume as a whole , and look upon any comparisons as being particularly odious , when applied to its component elements . ' We acknowledge a feeling of pride in the thought , that in the taste* ful and elegant contents of this book , our country has made such larbe amends for the quantities of nonsense , sublime noc ridiculous , which her sons have inflicted upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts . We venture to pronounce it a permanent accession to the treasures of English literature . We can not hut think , that there is that in it which men will not willingly let die , and that another generation will value it even more highly than we do . The truth is , that Mr. Everett would have more consulted his own fame , if he had been less good-natured , and , imitating the policy of Eastern monarchs , permitted himself to he seen and heard more rarely . For the last ei bht or ten years , we have so often enjoyed the opportunity of first listening to , and afterwards reading , his beautiful and finished discourses , that we have grown insensible to their merit , and have learned to look upon them as things to be expected of course , like roses in June and apples in October . We have not sufficiently reflected that there is not any one of Mr. Everett 's printed discourses , which would not materially add to the reputation of almost any other man in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , created the taste hy which he himself is judged . He has ennobled and dignified the employment of oration-making , and sustains somewhat the same relation to that branch of literature with us , which Homer did to Epic poetry in Greece . If any one will attempt , at the present time , to write an oration , he will perceive the extent of Mr. Everett 's influence , by the unconscious imitation of him , into which lie will fall . Much of the improvement which has been , of late , discernible in this class of productions , is to be fairly ascribed to the spirit which he has awakened , and to the models which he has afforded . He has made it easier to write a good oration than it formerly was , and has also made the public less tolerant of indifferent ones . Mr. Everett 's orations are nearly faultless , as literary efforts , and the only serious objection which we have to urge against them , ( which we shall state as filly and as frankly as we have expressed our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and partaking rather of a moral nature . We allude to the language of extravagant commendation , which he so frequently applies to our country , to our political institutions , to the events of our history , and to the great men who have shared in them . We are well aware that a good deal of this is expected from all public speakers , and it is reasonable and proper that audiences should be indulged to some considerable extent , in this respect . We believe too , that it is the duty of every man to // cherish a deep respect for the institutions of his country , for upon that respect must their value in a great measure depend ; and we would urge this duty the more strongly , because we apprehend that a considerable portion of our most cultivated and gifted men do not entertain any such respect , but , on the contrary , feel either indifference or distrust . Nor have we the slightest doubt of Mr. Everett 's entire sincerity in all that he says . But what we regret is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ; nor that he praises indiscriminately , and without qualification , for that he does not ; but that he does not sufficiently temper his eulogiums with the voice of warning and rebuke , and press home upon his hearers the solemn and stern truth , that of those to whom much is given , much will be required . He is too apt to feed that overweening national vanity , for which we are so conspicuous , and which makes us equally uneasy under the mild reproof of a judicious , and the ill-natured gibe of a prejudiced witness . We deem it to be the imperative duty of our great men to urge upon their countrymen , on all possible occasions , that if they are freer , happier , and more prosperous than others , therefore they ought to be xviser and better . The most striking thing to be observed of our institutions *s , that they are , in then7lselves , so characterless ; that is , that they take their character so entirely from the community for whose benefit they are intended . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from those destructive consequences , which must result from sins of omission or commission on our part . Mr. Everett is by no means the only person , against whom the above charge can , with justice , be sustained ; for the remark applies to nearly all our public speakers , and it is because he is so eminent a man and his opinions are justly entitled to so much weight , that we deem it especially important that he should set a good example in this respect . Mr. Everett is betrayed , occasionally , though very rarely , by his luxuriant stores of imagery , into the use of ornaments , either not in themselves in perfect good taste , or not appropriate to the subject , which they are designed to embellish , in the Eulogy upon Adams and Jefferson , we have the following paragraph . " Our juhilec , like that of old , is turned into sorrow . Among the crumbling ruins of Rome , there is a shattered arch , reared by the emperor Vespasian , when his son Titw returned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and falling frieze are still to be seen , represented as borne aloft in the triumphal procession of Titus , the well-known spoils of the second temple , the sacred vessels of the holy place , the candlestick with seven branches , and , in front of all , the silver trumpets of the jubilee , in the hands of captive priests , proclaiming not now the liberty , but the humiliation and the sorrows of Judah . From this mournful spectacle , it is said , the pious and heart-stricken 11ebre*v , even to the present day , turns aside in sorrow . He will not enter Rome , through the gate of the arch of Titus , hut winds his way through the by-paths of the Palatine , and over the broken columns of the palace of the Qesars , that he may not behold the sad image of the trumpets of the jubilee , borne aloft in the captive train . " - p. 125 . Nothing can be more beautiful or touching than the above paragraph ; but what has it to do with Adams and Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , and not for the sake of the illustration ; and , though the writer could not have drawn his pen through it , without a sigh of regret , we think it would have been the more judicious course for him to make the sacrifice . In the same Eulogy , he says , " the humblest sod of Independent America , with nothing but the dewcrops of the morning to gild it , is a prouder mausoleum than kings or conquerors can boast . " this sentence would be improved , it strikes us , by the omission of the words in Italics . In the discourse delivered at Lexington , speaking of Samuel Adams 's knowledge of liberty , he has the following sentence . " He knew it was no gaudy May-day flower , peeping through the soft verdant sods of Spring , and opening its painted petals as a dew-cup for midnight fairies to sip at . " This might have been judiciously spared , as being in itself a " dulce vitium , " and as particularly inappropriate when applied to that stern man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , with whom one could associate flowers and fairies . The above are slight blemishes , and would not be noticed , were not the discourses so nearly faultless as literary productions . We have spoken warmly of these orations of Mr. Everett , but not more warmly than sincerely . We are glad of the opportunity to offer our humble tribute of admiration to one , on whose eloquent lips we have so often hung delighted , and who , before he had left his academic bowers , filled our boyish conceptions of what a ripe and accomplished scholar ought to be . We feel that our literature owes much to him , // and that a considerable portion of what he has written will take rank with the best efforts of the American mind . Especially do we honor him for his untiring industry , and that love of labor for its own sake , not often found united with powers so brilliant . Few men have done more in the same time than he has , though many of his efforts have passed away and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects upon which they were lavished . His contributions to this journal , had he done nothing else , would have earned him the praise of an industrious man ; but , as it is , they form but one item in the crowded list of his labors , in his various functions of orator , scholar , and statesman . Besides his literary and political toils , of which the evidence remains in black and white , no man has more conscientiously performed all those petty personal and official duties , which " die and make no sign , " and which are such consumers of time , that most eminent men make their eminence an excuse for neglecting them altogether . Mr. Everett finds time to do every thing , and to do it well . In his preface to this volume , he gives us to understand , that another may hereafter be forthcoming , to comprehend the speeches , essays , and other miscellaneous compositions not contained in this . We hope that its appearance will not long be delayed , and we are sure that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deserves a permanent place in the library and on the book-table . In taking leave of a volume , so rich in all sorts of excellence that we have found it difficult to avoid falling into a monotonous tone of commendation , may we venture , nublamed , to exercise that privilege , which reviewers have claimed for themselves , time out of mind , of giving advice , whether they are qualified for it , or not ? We would respectfully recommend to Mr. Everett , to devote himself , hereafter , to some continued work , in which his reputation can be more surely trusted , than in orations and articles , however brilliant and successful . We know of no one , who has higher qualifications for an elaborate historical or biographical enterprise , than he ; his style is so finished , his taste so pure , his habits of investigation so thorough . He is in the prime of his life , and in the full possession of his fine powers ; and may anticipate , with as much confidence as we can rely upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many valuable and hard-working years , before he arrives at that period , when the easy-chair is coveted // before dinner . He has given enough of his time and powers to occasional efforts ; let him devote the prime of his manhood to some theme , to which he may address himself with the full strength of his mind , and bestow upon us a work , which shall be , in the language of Thucydides , a xv*uc* * in * a*A*w *xo*tv . For his own sake , and for his country 's sake too , we hope that this suggestion , made in the spirit of respectful deference , may find favor with him.
