LADY IN TROUBLE A STORY BY MARGERY SHARP ry'l HEY sat on a bench in the Row , big- gishh men all three of them , a good deal sunburned behind the cars , and agreed that the appearance of women had changed for the better . " My last leave , " said the Major thoughtfully , " they were all running about in skirts up to their knees and hats like small beehives . Very disconcertin ' . " His neighbor , Brodie , nodded . " My aunts  --  down in Devonshire  --  do still , " he said . " Sort of Black Watch effect . When they take me to church I want to dress ' cm by the right . " He relapsed into silence , and for some minutes the three sat smoking and reflective . The urban charm of the landscape , the variety of passing figures , the number of well-dressed women  --  all combined to soothe and satisfy . This , they felt , was what a leave should be  --  a fine morning in Hyde Park and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize and Challenge Cup , " said the third man suddenly . His name was Cotterill , his taste noted ; and with prompt unobtrusive attention the others followed his glance . The lady was tall , very slender , all in black . She wore a rather large hat , light-gray gloves , and a silver-fox fur drooping from one shoulder . At her side , coupled on a scarlet leash , stepped two small Bedlingtons . As he looked at her height , Cotterill thought what a remarkable woman she must be to have resisted the fashion-plate charm of a Borzoi . " By Jove ! " said Brodie . There was an appreciative silence ; the lady drew near , glanced at the three men , and so passed on . The look , however , was a curious one : completely casual , completely well-bred , yet with an underlying flicker of real interest . The flicker unfortunately died at once ; but it had been there , and unmistakable . Cotterill glanced at his companions , still gazing fatuously after , and wished them further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second phenomenon more curious than the first . " Good Lord , " he said , " she 's wearing odd stockings ! " It was true . One ankle ( had Cotterill but known it ) was clothed in tele-den  --  gre , the other in automme ; but though these subtleties were beyond him , he could easily distinguish a difference of at least three shades . " Very careless , " agreed the Major . " Careless ! " repeated Cotterill scornfully . " A girl  --  a woman Iike that does n't wear odd stockings just carelessly . I 'm not speaking of the turnout , I 'm speaking of her . If she had to wear one-and-elevenpenny cotton she would n't do it . They 'd be washed , and darned and the same color . " " Well , whether she would or not , she obviously has , " said the Major mildly . " Then there 's damn well something wrong , " retorted Cotterill ; and looking after her with renewed interest , observed two things more . In the first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction ; in the second , she was looking for someone . And that someone was a man : women could pass unheeded , but every man in sight , however seedy or even trampish in appearance , was favored with a swift , searching glance . Cotterill was puzzled ; if it were merely a conventional rendezvous , why the interest in tramps ? The same thing applied if she were simply picking someone up  --  which was in any case absurd , since she had " lady " written all over her . She looked as though she ought to have a car waiting at the Park gates , with a chauffeur in livery and possibly a coronet on the panel . And yet , and yet  --  she had on odd stockings . " There 's something wrong , " said Cotterill again . " I believe she 's in trouble . " Brodie grinned . " Out for a little knight-errantry ? I noticed she was your type . " " If you ask me , " warned the Major , " she 'll hand you straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his feet . Though his weakness for the tall , dark , and slender was too notorious to be denied , it counted at that moment for curiously little in his impulse . It was not because the lady was beautiful , but because the lady was in trouble , that he left his companions and walked purposefully across the grass . Approaching by a wide detour , Cotterill raised his hat and asked the way to the Serpentine . The lady looked at him curiously , then quickened her pace . For a moment Cotterill hesitated ; the snub was direct , but he had also seen her face , and from that one glance knew himself to be right . She was a lady in trouble  --  bad trouble : her lovely cheeks were white as paper . In two strides he caught up to her . " Please listen , " he said quickly . " I  --  I 'm not trying to pick you up . Only you seemed so  --  well , bothered , and I wondered if there was anything I could do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with averted face continued to walk quickly along . Cotterill walked with her , discomfited but tenacious ; and after a few moments he tried again . " If you just say , ' Go , ' I 'll go away at once . Only do please think first if there 's any way you can make use of me . " At that , unexpectedly , she stopped and turned round . " I do n't understand . Why are you behaving like this ? " " That 's just what I 'm trying to tell you , " said Cotterill thankfully . " I saw you walking along , and I  --  and you looked in trouble . " In spite of himself his eyes dropped to her ankles , but she did not seem to notice . He finished his prologue . " I am not , " added Cotterill explicitly , " a Bad Man . " The lady almost smiled . " I do n't believe you are , " she said . " Then will you let me help ? " " Help ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more closely than before , while Cotterill , by squaring his shoulders and stiffening his jaw , did all he knew to appear competent and trustworthy . He apparently succeeded ; for when the scrutiny was over she said quietly : " You 're a soldier , are n't you ? " Cotterill followed her thought . " Which means that as soon as my leave 's up be off to an outpost of Empire and you 'll never see me again . " They had fallen into step : the brim of her hat now hid her profile ; but the hand holding the leash , twisting and twisting , brought the Bedlingtons close to heel . " It  --  it 's about my husband , " said the lady suddenly . On Cotterill the words had a curious effect . For a moment , and for no reason whatever ( he told himself ) , the adventure lost all interest . He felt slightly bored . On the least pretext he would have raised his hat and bidden her good-day . But no pretext occurred , and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficed . " I 've bought it , " thought Cotterill . Aloud  --  since she showed no signs of continuing  --  he said politely : " What about your husband partial-lady ? " " He 's lost , " said the lady . " He was shell-shocked in the War , and  --  I do n't know how to explain it  --  he sometimes forgets everything and just wanders off . I 'm trying the Park because we 've walked here . " " Damned hard lines , " said Cotterill , with more sympathy than he felt . He had been shell-shocked himself , but he did n't roam off giving trouble to his relations . However , if the fellow were lost , and for some reason she wanted him back , he would do what he could about it . Hospitals , thought Cotterill , the police , the B.B.C. . . . " You 've been to the police of course ? " he said . The lady shook her head . " You have n't ? " cried CotterilI , quite scandalized . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explained the lady , smiling a little , " is a Bad Man . " Involuntarily Cotterill paused . Among the many worlds of London there was one , he knew , to whose inhabitants a policeman was less a friend in need than a perpetual enemy ; but it was by no means his world , and now , with his foot at the boundary , so to speak , instinct bade him draw back . " I 've frightened you , " said the lady . Cotterill at once plunged over . " I 'm at your service , " he said . " Be-sides --  " Besides , " said the lady , " I exaggerated . He has n't done anything ; it 's simply ? " she said this as though it made everything easy and aboveboard ? " simply that he ought n't to be in the country at all . I must explain : my husband is a Russian Count . " " Who lost everything in the Revolution , " added Cotterill glibly . " Yes , " said the lady . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe it , but because it 's true . " Cotterill flushed . " I beg your pardon . If you had put it that you were a Countess I should have believed you at once . " " That , " said the lady simply , " is probably because I 'm also a manikin . When I met my husband , in Paris , he was a taxi-driver . But he is n't strong  --  now  --  and it was killing him . That was one reason why I wanted him over here . Another is that they 're trying to get him back into Russia , to answer a charge of counter-Revolutionary activities . The real reason of course ? " her charming voice softened ? " is that I simply wanted him . " Cotterill digested this information in silence . He believed her to be speaking the truth ; but at the same time her story suggested a great many questions to which he did not immediately see the answers . Before he could put them , however , the lady suddenly clutched his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she was simply trying not to faint . " Here , " said Cotterill , " did you have any breakfast ? " " No , " she admitted . " I had n't time . I had to go out and look , and then there was the shop . And last night  --  he was n't there when I got back  --  last night I was so worried . " " Do n't say another word till you 've had lunch , " ordered Cotterill firmly . This at least was an emergency he could deal with . They were fortunately near the bridge , so he hailed a taxi , put her in , bundled the dogs after , and gave the address of a restaurant in Piccadilly . But the lady heard and disobeyed her instructions . " No ! " she cried . " The Petit Coin de Provence  --  off Glasshouse Street . He might come there . " It sounded an awful sort of address to Cotterill , and his face must have shown it ; for she added , more calmly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And because of the dogs , you see . The proprietor 's little girls take them for a walk after lunch . " " That settles it , " said Cotterill , and did not see her smile . At the Petit Coin de Provence a table awaited them : the lady was evidently a known and appreciated client . Two small girls received the Bedlingtons with joy , a waiter hurried for their orders , and the food was a good deal better than Cotterill had expected . All through the meal he kept up a steady monologue on the subject of horse-breeding , and never in his life had he had a more attentive and delightful listener . " I bet she looks well on a horse , " he thought ; and suddenly , in that little foreign eating-house he had a perfectly clear vision of himself and the lady cantering over the downs . " Now you must Jet me talk , " she said at last . But the words had no sting : her smile thanked him for so interesting and entertaining her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the shop at half-past two . There 's a manikin parade at three , a very important one , and I dare n't miss it . I want you to stay here till I come back . I 'm afraid it wo n't be till six . If my husband comes I want you to bring him  --  to make him come  --  to my flat . It 's 20 Chapel Mansions , Bloomsbury . I 've left the key under the door-mat for him , and you must keep him there till I come back . " " But  --  how shall I know him ? " asked Cotterill . " He 's very tall and thin and  --  like this . " She opened her bag and took out a small photograph . The face , to Cotterill 's eye , was not prepossessing , though he supposed some persons might have called it distinguished ; and as he looked he first of the unasked questions rose abruptly to his lips . " How did he get over here at all ? " " Through friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " repeated the lady finally . Cotterill accepted it . " Has he been here long ? " " Only three days . I 've hardly seen him ! " " They wo n't let him take work here , you know ? " " I know . " " But you yourself ? " began Cotterill , struck by a sudden thought . The lady looked straight before her . " If I spoke of him as my husband , " she said , in her clear low voice , " that was to make you understand . But of course if I lost my nationality I 'd lose my work . " Cotterill sat silent . " Lady in trouble ! " he was thinking . And what trouble ! Saddled with a crock of a foreigner , not even married to him , breaking the law of the country for him  --  and now , when the blighter had providentially disappeared , without a thought in the world except how to get him back ! It was insane ! It was fine in its way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her so  --  though she had doubtless read his thought already ; but the moment was not allowed him . As he opened his mouth to speak a woman came into the restaurant , bought some matches at the desk , and in turning to go caught sight of their table . At once her eyebrows went up in malicious amusement . " So there you are ! " she called . " I wondered why your friend was lunching alone . " " Where ? " asked the lady quickly . " We were expecting him here . " " At Larue 's , in Greek Street . And you 're going to be late , my dear . " " Larne 's , " repeated the lady under her breath . " It 's somewhere I do n't know . And I ca n't  --  there is n't time ? " She broke off , and with a sigh of relief ( as though she had just remembered his presence ) turned back to Cotterill . " You 'll go , " she said simply . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your name ? " " Verinder . Elspeth Verinder . " A sudden lovely flush warmed her cheeks . " He may n't  --  at first  --  remember about me . If he does n't , say to him  --  the Close-Tie des Lilas , and the night we stood on the Pont du Carrousel , and the day at Fontainebleau when there was a cloud shaped like a hunch of flowers . But make him come ! Whatever happens , promise you 'll make him come ! " " I promise , " said Cotterill ; and as soon as she was out of sight , turned his steps towards Soho . He walked quickly along , frowning and unhappy Having given his word , he would keep it ; but he had never dis-liked an errand more . For the one fact which stood out , the one clear idea he carried away , was that the lady would be best served if , instead of keeping his promise , he turned her blackguard of a ? husband  --  straight over to the police . She was young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her : and she proposed to give it all up for the sake of some foreign impostor ! She , who ought to receive devotion , not give it ; who ought to be served , cared for , shielded from every ugliness ! You did n't meet women like that often , women with that perfect grace and steeled spirit ; and when you did you wanted to lay down your life for them . . . . " I 'm mad ! " thought Cotterill . " What do I really know about her ? I only met her two hours ago . " But when he remembered the women he had known for two months , or for two years , it seemed to him that time had very little to do with it . The world he had so casually strayed into was even stranger than he expected . Larue 's Restaurant in Greek Street was small , shabby , and at that hour of the afternoon deserted save for an elderly Frenchwoman knitting at the cash-desk . Before going out again , however , Cotterill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements for Byrrh , stood slightly ajar . " There is another room ? " he asked . Madame jerked her head in the door 's direction and continued to knit . Cotterill advanced , went through , and found himself in a room even smaller than the first . It contained four tables and one solitary occupant , a man who on Cotterill 's entrance slowly pushed back his chair and stood up as if to go . He was very tall , unbelievably gaunt , and wore a raincoat that did not fit . His hair and clipped mustache were turning gray , his skin had the faint yellowish tan of a sick man who lives much out of doors . Only his eyes commanded respect : they looked at Cotterill as though from a great distance , but steadily , courteously , and witha great tranquillity . " He 's given up worrying , " thought Cotterill bitterly . " He leaves it all to her . " And since the likeness to the photograph was unmistakable , since this was undoubtedly the man , Cotterill cleared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Miss Verinder . " Courteously , steadily , the mart looked him in the face . " I do not know a Miss Verinder . " Cotterill paused . He felt an overwhelming desire to let it go at that , to throw up his errand and leave this wreck of a man to go to his fate alone . But he had given his word , and he kept it . " I have nothing to do with the . . . authorities , " he said . " As a matter of fact , I only met Miss Verinder this morning . She thinks you may have forgotten , but you left her flat last night , and she expects you back . Shc is extremely worried . If you will come with me ? " The door opened wider , and a little waiter , his apron over his arm , looked anxiously in . " M'sieu d  --  sire ? " " Nothing ! " said Cotterill impatiently . But the man did not go ; he stood looking at the Russian and fluttering a slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Russian , in his deep slow voice . " Here ! " What looked to Cotterill like a few coppers passed from hand to hand . The waiter bowed , scurried out ; and seeing that his quarry was about to follow , Cotterill reached out and laid a hand on the man 's shoulder . For a moment he had the sensation of grasping something as hard , as unfleshed , as a bar of iron ; the next instant his hand was flung so violently off that it swung back against his own side . But the deep unhurried voice was as deep and unhurried as before . " I regret that you have been troubled by a mistake . I do not know the lady . " " I am to remind you , " said Cotterill , " of a place in Paris called the Closerie des Li/as . " There was no answer . " I am to remind you , " went on Cot-terill doggedly , " of a night when you stood on the Pont du Carrousel , and of a clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian swung round . " Stop ! " lie cried . " There is no need ! Do you think I have forgotten ? " " Miss Verinder thought so , " said Cotterill . " She thought you had lost your memory . If it has come back there 's nothing more for me to do . But I do n't mind telling you that if I followed my own inclinations I should do a great deal . " " For example ? " " Conduct you straight to the nearest police-station . " The Russian smiled . " If you wish , you may accompany me , " he said , " for that is exactly where I am going . " Across the narrow table the two men looked at each other ; and Cotterill , for all his height , was the one who looked up . " But I thought ? " " That they will deport me ? Of course . That is why I had intended to take another route , but last night my friends told me it is closed . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will ask questions ; however , my memory will always fail me at need . " Cotterill sat down . He felt completely bewildered ; but at least , in this different world , there was no need for him to disguise it . " Then you had n't lost your memory at all ? " " No . It has happened , but not this time . I went like that because I knew Miss Verinder would wish to prevent inc . I thought I could go last night , but as I tell you , the route has been closed . Since then I have been thinking . " Suddenly the grave tired face relaxed . " When you came into this room , I knew what you were thinking . You were thinking , ' The blackguard ! ' " No , " lied Cotterill . " But you were , and very naturally . It is natural to any Englishman to thinkany Russian a blackguat d. it is not your fault ; it is because we are so different , and to the English anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in my case ? " he struck himself lightly on the chest ? " you had other reasons as well . The strongest reasons . You saw me ill , useless , a burden and a danger to a woman who does not bear my name , and with whom you yourself are in love . " " No ! " cried Cotterill , thoroughly startled . " But why do you deny it ? " asked the Russian with real curiosity . He sat down again . " Is it because you have met her only to-day , and you do not think it respectable to fall in love on so short an acquaintance ? Is it because you fear it would offend me ? I do not say it would have offended me if you had not ; but I should have thought you more stupid than I do . It is so natural ! " " You seem to think , " said Cotterill , " that if anything 's natural that excuses it . " " Of course it does . Or at any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general excusable . You do not think like that ? " " No , I do n't , " said Cotterill grimly . " That is because you are English . With Russians it is different . And there is another weakness about us ? " he smiled again ? " even at the most bitter of personal moments , we can never resist a philosophic discussion . As I was saying : you came in , and you thought , ' This blackguard ' ; but though I have shown that you were to be excused , you were not right . I should be a blackguard if I stayed ; but I am not going to stay . " " Then why did you come at all ? " " But  --  to see her ! Do you not know , if you have to be separated from someone you love how it makes it easier if you know where she is living , among what people , how she spends her days ? Now I can say  --  it is eight o'clock , she will be taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is half-past one , she is lunching at the French restaurant , where the waiter looks after her and keeps her LADY IN table . I can picture her in her room with the window-boxes , or going through the big doors where she works in Bruton Street , the commissionnaire holding them for her as though she were a  --  Countess . I know that she is well treated , that she is not worried by little cares . If I had not seen for myself , I could not have been sure ; and so I had to come . Even an Englishman can understand that . " " Yes , " said Cotterill , " and I beg your pardon . " The Russian bowed . " Thank you . Now I can ask you to be of service to me . " He put his hand to his breast-pocket and drew out a thin leather case , very shabby , but with gold corners . It fell open in his hand : on one side was a faded lithograph of a woman in a low dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady . This , very slowly , he slipped out of the leather frame . " Please take it , " he said . " I do not wish to have anything that connects her with me  --  that may bring her more trouble . Later , when it is safe , I will write to you , and you shall send it back . But please be very careful . " Cotterill took the photograph and put it in his wallet . He moved all his own papers to one side , so that she should have a place to herself . Then he took out a card and wrote on the back the name and address of his bank . " That will always find me , " he said , " and I will take great care . " " Thank you . Now the police will not be made curious . " " Where , " asked Cotterill , with growing discomfort , " will they send you ? " " I do not know . Possibly to Russia . I would like it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood up , tall , gaunt , distinguished . Even in a raincoat that did not fit he had the air of one who courteously terminates an audience . He looked what he was  --  a great gentleman ; and he was going to be deported . ? " Wait , " said Cotterill suddenly . " It 's the week-end ; it 's Friday . You can get to Paris without a passport . " " I know . " " Then why in heaven 's name-2 " " Because I have no money , " said the Russian simply . " My God ! " thought Cotterill . " What a fool 1 and " His hand went to his notecase : there was a five-pound note in it , and two ten-shillings . " " If you would n't mind accepting a loan , " he began awkwardly . The other laughed . " Why can not you say what you mean ? Why can not you ? You mean it as a gift ; I take it ; we are both honored . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappiness ? " He pushed the notes into his pocket and glanced at the clock . " Now I shall go back to her fiat and leave a letter there . If I do not send it by you it is because she must have it immediately , and immediately  --  just now ? she will be very angry with you . I do not advise you to go there quite at once . " " I had no intention of going , " said Cotterill , with a return to stiffness . " Of course not . But you will have an intention in a day or two . You will think ? ' How is she ? Can I do anything ? ' ? just as I think . It is so natural ! Do you know , I have a great temptation to leave Miss Verinder in your charge ? " Cotterill stood up . " But I will not , " continued the Russian tranquilly , " because it would put you  --  how to say ? ? because you would feel put upon your honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will feel uneasy . " Cotterill listened speechless . Every word was true , but only a Russian , he felt , could have spoken them . At this stage in the conversation , however , he knew better than to answer ; he had no wish for another bout of philosophy . His one desire was to get out of the restaurant before he could be shocked again . And this desire was to a certain extent granted , for though he received one shock more upon the threshold , it was , so to speak , a negative one . " Do not be alarmed , " said the Russian gently ; " I am not about to embrace you " ; and with a nod as curt as Cotterill 's own , he turned on his heel and strode away . In the three days which elapsed before Cotterill sought Miss Verinder 's flat he avoided all contact with his friends Brodie and the Major . They would be more curious than he wished : they would expect a good story , of a kind suitable to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new tolerance ; when a tale started with a pair of odd stockings , you did n't expect it to turn into the most important story in a man 's life . So he kept away from his club , and from his usual eating-places . He had some queer idea that by so doing he kept out of his own world and stayed in the lady 's . He would return eventually of course ; and perhaps he would bring her with him . At half-past six on the Tuesday evening Cotterill made his way to Chapel Mansions . It was a large block of flats , once the last word in modernity , now liftless and gloomy , evidently awaiting the house-breaker . But Miss Verinder 's door , when he reached it on the fifth floor , was painted a fresh green , and the little oxydized knocker was shaped like a dolphin . Cotterill lifted and knocked , then rang the bell ; he had so much to think about that he hardly knew , after five minutes , whether it was time to ring again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl came out of the door opposite and paused at the head of the stairs . " That flat 's empty , " she said . Cotterill swung round . " Does n't Miss Verinder live here ? " " She did , but she 's gone . She went two days ago . She 's got a new job , in Paris . " It was a queer world , thought Cotterill ; but there were some fine things in it .
