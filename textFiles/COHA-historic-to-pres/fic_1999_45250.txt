Editor 's Note : An excerpt from the recently completed novel , Ceremony Of Innocence . <p> Spirit away the princess to where the century has landed in the lap of the past . Set her down , gently now , still rubbing her eyes from the gust of passage . Will she recognize the place ? Is there anything she will recognize ? Yes , of course : what has n't tumbled down in ruins . And from travel posters be transposed into the midst of palaces and wonders . <p> Look about . A legacy of splendor in stone . All that gives the leap to the eye : arches and columns , spires and domes . The daring corvette , play of the arabesque in the peacock 's eye . Dazzle of sun . There , there , there . Lavishness of stone : sun given back from the warm facades . And all sliding by , slipping into the shadow of the seen , the already forgotten . Look back , hold on : you ca n't , do n't try . Go where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by water ; by water enter , to be ferried along , lost in the tides : revelers , the press and stream of . Palaces and wonders , the edge , the surround of Water lapping the edges of stone , lapping and stroking . The patience of water , wearing time away . The stain at the water line , the leaning and sinking . Look up . <p> She had escaped . Just barely , and for how long ? Spirited away by the magician . In the light bright beyond February , standing , leaning on the railing of the boat , hair blowing back from his face . Koenig the magician , who had sent her forth in borrowed clothes . Borrowed from one who no longer exists : Helga , disappeared . Nothing is her own . No piece of life . Everything cut loose from the moorings , afloat . And herself . For five nights she 'd try to lose herself , putting herself into costume and mask . To hide . That is her only thought . Disguise . Pretending to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one more particle , to be lost among them , to throw off the pursuer . Love-no , the illusion of love-brought me here . Love sent me fleeing . And where have I come ? To depend on the bounty of strangers . I dare not look behind me . <p> -I 'm hoping for something new , Koenig tells her . A lead that will take me somewhere . Our lodging is right near St. Mark 's . We 'll rest there for a little while , then go out . <p> He has his own project , and as long as he is there she has something to moor herself to . How strange-she would eat and sleep as other people do . Pretending to be human . In a borrowed place . And for a price , always for a price . Only this time she can not pay . Time is snagged here , in the notch of the moment . Nothing matters : money does n't exist . A child lives this way . What is money ? - coppers to play with , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just oblivious to it . The iron gates are always there . Perhaps the child knows , as she does . There are things you ca n't help knowing . <p> At the moment , drop everything , give yourself to the motion of the boat . You are a stranger in a land of strangers . Who are the enchanted ones ? Do not undertake to know the magician . Nor count on him . He has his own projects . Enough that he has spirited you away . Let him stand in his darkness , as though he hoarded a secret ; you have yours as well . Let him stand in the guise of a friend . <p> - How will I repay you ? She 'd wanted to know that . I have nothing left . <p> - It 's of no consequence . <p> - You 've saved my life . She did n't know what for . <p> - Maybe you 'll do the same for me . <p> He did n't mean it , of course . Smiling , a brief light in his eyes . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Venice . He was doing all of it . He 'd told no one where he was going . He did n't answer the phone . <p> Should she protest that he 'd made a bad bargain after all ? It did n't seem to matter . He 'd made no promises of any sort . She could have asked to go back to the States . But that seemed too overwhelming an effort . All she could do was put one foot in front of the other . <p> Turn away again to watch the marriage of water and stone . The stone makes a place for the water . Solid , even if washed by the tides , everything leaning , sinking . The corpse of Empire , decaying in the glory of sun on stone . Tourists and revelers thronging among her lingering beauties . What , still alive after all the centuries ? Here to watch us come and go , if the century does n't rear up in some new ugliness . For the moment , you 've escaped . <p> The boat jolts against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the flow of people down the ramp and along the quay , into the Piazzetta . Then into the great square of St. Mark , the campanile piercing the sky . Koenig ahead of her , carrying their luggage , certain of the way . Past the clock tower in front of the cathedral . The columns rise lifting the golden rounds : capturing the figures of time , rising into flourishes of stone , the four horses leaping out , booty from the temples at Delphi , and rising still , the domes above curving into an oriental splendor , to concoct a fantasy : that beauty rises from the earth , that all is light , airy . Real in its lightness . Yet solid . <p> Along the colonnades , reaching down the square , is a repetition of solidity : nothing can outlast this stone , this victory of a tower , these proofs and offerings . Now filled with people , walking underneath the flutter of pigeon wings . Sellers of balloons and corn for the pigeons . Sellers of souvenirs . Postcardsbuttonshatsfilm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people come to celebrate . Clusters of pigeons . Carnevale . Everythingmixed uppressed together . Facesfacesfaces . <p> The crowd parts suddenly and a robe , deep red , velvet embroidered with flowers , moves through . A gold mask . Gold above red velvet . On the shoulders , two faces , also gold , eyes closed beyond repose , rise into peaks of reddish gold and merge into a single cap . Rising as though out of flowing lava . She can not see into the closed eyes that pull the faces so far away , beyond the living . She reaches for Koenig . She does n't know why she is horrified . <p> What are they ? I do n't know what they are . Neither alive nor dead , man or woman . Faces . Have I lost my face ? <p> - You see everything here , Koenig says , no doubt to assuage her . <p> It does not assure her . It embarrasses her to cling to someone this way . You see what you do n't know . Facesfaces . Have I lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure , snapping pictures . <p> - Come , Koenig says , rousing her from her inertia . Otherwise she would simply have stood there , unable to separate herself from the throng . We 'll go to our place and then have a bite to eat . He is not there for pleasure . Nor , for that matter , is she . His one thought is to set out to make contact with the man whom Helga knew , who had some connection with her . She really does n't want to think about Helga , it is too much . Nor the prisoner either , though she has taken him with her . Helga she never met-but that does n't seem to protect her . She 'll have to let Koenig worry with it . <p> After they check in at the hotel , a small hotel on the canal , Koenig calls the man he wants to interview , asks directions to his shop . He is a maker of masks , one of the infinite number in the city . On the way they will have lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces the way , folds it up and puts it in his pocket . <p> Then they are in the streets again , turning from one into another . She can not keep track of how they came and has no notion of how they 'll get back . They burrow through the streets like tunnels , across little bridges , around buildings . Up the many steps with the moving throng , across the Rialto Bridge and down into the market . <p> For a moment she is stopped by the movement and color . Fruits and vegetables . Brilliance of fruit and flower . Stalks of gladiolus . Roses . Riches . Somehow she had forgotten . Pistachios and pecans , the brown wealth of nuts . Salamis and cheeses , olives and pickles . Then along to where the smell of fish takes over , from piles of shrimp and shellfish and the rest of the yield of the Adriatic : fish , great and small , pink meat and white over the delicate bones ; the sheath of gray-silver scales , the white glistening bellies . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ octopodes , piles of snails . <p> They pause in a little trattoria for a plate of pasta and a glass of wine , quite hungry now from the boat ride , their trek through the streets . Koenig eats quickly , self-absorbed , as though eager to be on his way . <p> - You 're thinking about her , are n't you ? " <p> - Yes , pardon my bad manners . He wipes his mouth , sits back , contemplates the wine . There is no hurry , I suppose . All this has been going on for months , without any satisfactory information . I think I 'm in a hurry to do something , when I know it is only my anger that drives me . And chances are , everything will make me furious <p> - You do n't think you 'll find anything ? <p> He shrugs-More lies , I suspect . They said at first it was a suicide , even claimed to have a note in her handwriting . But when the police were asked to produce it , it had mysteriously disappeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forge it . <p> - You 're convinced she was murdered then ? There were people who wanted to kill her ? <p> -I think so . The articles she was writing . Mostly on the environment . She did a piece against the proposed Expo in <p> Venice . It would have destroyed the city . And finally the plans were changed . But the main thing she was onto was about the toxic waste being taken to Czechoslovakia from America , to be burned in factories there . Some kind of organization with a base in Germany . She knew things . <p> How extraordinary it is-knowing things . All that lies under the surface . <p> A parade of people passes by the window . All the young from everywhere , arms linked or thrown round one another , laughing , tipping back their heads to drink the beer from the cans they carry , some with masks on or some piece of costume . And here she is sitting there , with the prisoner 's journal in her lap , so to speak . A book like no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The book of hell . And what is she supposed to do with it ? What is to be her knowledge ? <p> - What do you hope to find ? Koenig shrugs again . -I do n't know . The killers ? It is too much to hope , and yet <p> He could n't let go of it . <p> - Time rolls over such things , there are so many casualties . And yet , to bow before the world 's lies . . . To let everything just sink to the bottom , as though one thing had no more meaning than another . . . - Do you think there 's a meaning then ? Outside , she sees everything sliding past , an endless parade of color and shape , dancing before the eyes , a whirl of confetti , like the colors she got as a child rubbing her eyes before sleep . - It is hard to be convinced , he says , solemnly . Very hard . And hard not to think some principle works to snuff out any hint or intuition of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives a little laugh . Neither God nor the devil . The squirming facts , what did your poet say . . . exceed the squamous mind . There are people wanting a table , and he signals the waiter for the check . But come , this is Venice after all , and she does n't let you sit with your questions . Anytime you sit down you have to pay for it . They pass shops full of glass , vases and figurines , beads in a thousand sparkling necklaces . Glass leaping into birds and animals , all the creatures . A whole creation real and fantastic , the play of artifice . And masks . Shops filled with them . She would prefer to stop immediately , seize hold of any one of them , to pull her face out of public scrutiny . She can not help feeling that she is pursued , that Jimmy who knows the workings of her mind , knows exactly where she is . With a mask at least , she might be able to trick him . But Koenig hurries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has his appointment and time is growing short . - This is the place , Koenig says . For a moment they pause before the window of one more shop filled with masks . Here in this city , Koenigjokes , it is impossible to find a plumber , which you most likely have greater need of , but you 'll never want for a mask . Indeed the sun has a face and so does the moon ; the winds puff out their cheeks . Birds , red and blue and black and gilt , stare down at their prey , exult with great gilt beaks . As they enter , on the walls of the shop , a whole cast of clowns and fools , lions and courtesans . Behind a counter a small sharp-faced woman finishes with a customer trying on a hat decorated with plumes and pearls . Satisfied , she pulls the veil down over her face and looks to her companions , a short plump woman and a man , for approval . Then she chooses a white mask with red lips . - Bella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents his card. -I 'm here to see Camillo . I spoke with him a little while ago . - Yes , yes , the woman says . A terrible thing about poor Helga , she says confidentially . Yes , we are most sorry to hear . Camillo spoke to the authorities . He was the one-She thinks better of it and breaks off . But he will tell you himself . I will tell him you 're here . She smiles at Florrie . But you will enjoy the carnival , I hope . It will help to forget . She goes to the back . - Camillo , she calls . There is a note to her voice , as of warning . Like the cry of a bird . Florrie is filled with uneasiness . Forgetfulness . Of what is too much to remember . It is allowed here : things allowed to fall out of time . But can one afford it ? Something lingers at the edge that refuses to lie down under the confetti or the muck . Life and death , how confused they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any one of these masks she stands looking at . Once Koenig spoke of his , hiding his death . Perhaps that , too , is what she has to hide . <p> And now Camillo . He appears , a tall man , gaunt man , skeletal , but whose presence carries beyond his bones , as though a larger shadow fed the deep ridges and hollows of his face . Black hair and mustache , a certain dark look . <p> - Helga 's friend , yes , Mr. Koenig . You are very welcome . Shaking of hands . I 'm sorry you are here on such a sad business . When it is such a time of celebration . But you will receive hospitality-when we have done with this business . You must take away a good impression of our city . He makes her shiver , this man . Under his words , he gives out a coldness that freezes the blood . While he and Koenig speak of Helga in low tones , she wanders around the shop . The woman comes up to her. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance want a mask for the carnival ? <p> It is the one thing she wants . Her eye scans the array . The fool , let her go as that . It would reveal her to the world even as it disguised her . - But tonight you must go as lovers , you and your companion . Lucia tells her , bringing forward the mask of a beautiful woman . <p> As a lover . What would she know about that . Perhaps if she had the mask , she might discover what one is . And Jimmy-it might be he would never find her then . She is about to take it , to ask Koenig to buy it for her . She lingers at the edge of the conversation . - There are certain people I can talk to , Camillo says . Come back tomorrow . I may have something . The police here , I know them well , I know who investigated . But they did not tell me what they found . The report-we shall have a look at that . <p> She can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Camillo sees the mask in her hand. - No , that is not for you , he says , taking it from her . I will have to show you . Lucia , give our friend here some coffee , while I show this lady . <p> - Really , I 'm quite . . . Koenig is impenetrable , though quite willing to sit back , to let her go . And Camillo will not take her refusal . -I keep all the best things in the back . He lowers his voice as if it is a secret. - You will have to see . I am not part of this . It is not for me to know . She does not trust this man . Let her not trust anyone . It is very strange . Why such bother ? There is no one she wants to be really . Is it a good night for lovers ? If she went as Eve , she would require no costume , no mask . But there is no garden any more in this bawdy world , or let us say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill everything else . Only labor and the snake at the heel . Love-Something suitable for the winding narrow streets , for the beer drinkers , sellers of postcards , camera freaks . Through a narrow little doorway to the back , down a passage . The light is dim : like entering another element . Denser , yet vaporous . Far from the warmth of the street , the sun on stones , the lapping water . Far from the taste of white clam sauce on pasta . Only a buzz of wine in her head . Will she be able to breathe ? She can not imagine love . <p> There can be no love when everything must be kept hidden , nothing revealed to the light of day . What have you saved me for ? The lights leap on , sweep around the room , a ballroom itself , full of figures all in costume . She gasps in admiration . It is another world , its inhabitants seemingly more than real in their gowns of velvet and brocade , silk and lace ; in their breeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faint at first , insinuating , draw the figures into motion , and when she turns towards Camillo , he gives a slight bow . The figures turn and raise their arms , enter the dance . Like a great music box . <p> - How astonishing , she says . It is magic , and it plays upon her , tricks her into pleasure . <p> He acknowledges the compliment , his due. - Courtly society , he says . All the ladies and their gentlemen . Ready for intrigue , the pageants of power . There is much to see . -A museum ? she says . <p> - No , no , a living artifact . Many come to study the parade of fashion-rooms of it . The costumes become part of the city , he tells her . They give their spirit to the carnival , the dance . And you must choose . -I ? What would I choose ? <p> He gives a little laugh . - From among the lovers , the great bloom of desire . You know that , do n't you ? <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has chosen badly from among lovers . What she wants is disguise . - All this , the shadow and the drape . He waves his hand . But the power . He brings his fist into his hand . A thing of the gods . From desire , a world comes into being . And continues . Leda and the Swan . The god swoops down and makes a world inside a womanHe has yellow teeth , an unpleasant mouth . His hands move as though creating the fantasies he wants her to see , all the creatures rising up from a froth of sperm , the appetites of the gods . With his eye , his expression , he gestures in a wave of lust that spins along through ages of costumes and masks . Decolletage and black stockings . The figures themselves seem to ogle and leer at one another . Queen and courtesan , advertising their wares . Buy , sell , and trade . It is suffocating down there , and she has heard too many voices claiming to speak of love . They are a din @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint . <p> - Is there something the matter ? I hope I have n't offended you . He is all attention . He takes her hand , smoothes her fingers . She pulls away and turns to go upstairs . - How foolish of me . I get carried away . I forgot the fan . Do forgive me . Let me offer you some wine . He hastens off after they emerge . Koenig stands up ready to leave , but Camillo and his wife will not hear of it . They must stay for wine and for something to eat . Wine to bring the blood to the lady 's cheeks . They will drink to Carnevale . To friendship . To lovers , for this is their night . They will drink to the memory of their friend . And to love . Camillo has her hand again , raises it to his lips . Such a lovely hand . The touch of his lips burns as though a flame had touched her , and she holds down a cry . He will poison them with his wine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for help , she sees that he has grown amiable with these people . She is being tricked , but whether by Camillo or her own mind , it is difficult to say . He is there in front of her like a large black bird , his shadow filling the room . And she is afraid . Surely Koenig can not trust this man . He was , Koenig said himself , one of the last to see Helga alive . And with his wine he 'll poison them , and call it suicide as well . But Koenig gives no sign . - Here , keep hold of my hand . It is easy to get separated here . There in front of her he stands , with features capped by a black and silver hat , around his shoulders a black cape , and black tights . A single brilliant red tear is on his cheek . The lover . Something for Koenig to hide behind . <p> She puts a hand up to her own mask . A young girl for her . She remembers standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has chosen ? With three faces , a triad of faces . To replace the one she has lost ? She is three in one . When she touches her hair , she finds a gathering of lace , a mantilla with a rose on top . One sleeve puffs up , flares out all in silver , a new moon sweeps across her shoulder ; the other , black with a sprinkling of stars . A short flaring skirt of silver and black , and tights and silver shoes . She remembers Camillo handing her a fan , laughing lightly . - Tonight for youth and sentiment . It all begins with that . -I do n't trust that man , she says to Koenig . How long had they sat drinking wine , eating the food that has miraculously appeared ? The young girl , Violetta , had served them , who should be here now in her place . The youthful innocence . Hard to believe in a daughter of Camillo . And then after the long stretch of conviviality that threw its haze over her , the costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have others . And see how the masks are made . For these Camillo designs himself . What you become is what you see . You only have to get inside the mask and let the spirit of it come to visit . His family are all craftsmen , and theirs are the best masks in the city . Everything to bring them pleasure . As though that is what they came for . A seduction into the delights of carnevale . No , they can not refuse . And Violetta will take them around the city , show them the churches , the paintings , all the beauties . <p> - No , you are quite right not to trust him , Koenig says . I think it 's all an elaborate ruse to throw us off the trail . - Do you think he will tell you anything ? -I think he 'll try to put me off with a mixture of lies and half truths . Musicians appear around them in the little square they are making their way across . Musicians in tights and short jackets and peaked caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la-tri-o-la . Singing , spinning into their midst , a boy all golden curls . Cape round his shoulders flaring out , he spins to a stop , throws aside his cape . Stands , stripped to the waist . Holds up a mirror and paints his cheeks with rouge , as he listens and smiles , leans his head one way and another . A young girl running up , laughing , seizes the mirror and swims it around , peeks to one side and over it . She 'll not let him see , but hides the mirror behind her back , while he reaches for it , furious . She tries to capture an arm , but he shakes her off . Then a young man pulls her away and slaps her , chases her down the street . <p> - How do you find out anything then ? How do you know anything more than you knew before ? She can not tell how he reacts behind the mask . <p> - Sometimes a word escapes . Already I guess he knows more than what he pretends . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling he 's connected with it . - Is n't that dangerous for you to know ? His hand feels cool even with hers in it . Their connections are very tenuous . -I shall have to play along for a brief while . A little bluff on both sides . And that 's a tricky business . I 'm thinking the best thing might be for me to go on to Prague before he expects me to . - Part of the bluff ? -I 'm not sure yet . - You 'd leave me behind ? Merging , mingling figures . In a parade of figures , moving over bridges , across narrow canals , through the streets , making way for little clusters of people coming from the other direction , drifting under the lights . Taffeta and brocade : the sweep of skirts , the swell of sleeves and bustles ; robes and pantaloons . White coiffures sweeping , coiling upwards . Velvet hats with plumes and feathers . Masks of red and gold . Mosaic masks . White masks . Masks on a stem , held to mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flowering of lights . They stand in the square to watch . -I 'm not certain yet of anything . He promises reports from the police . But what does that mean ? - It 's dangerous , is n't it ? <p> - It may be . You do n't know such things . There may be a subtle threat in all of this . He did n't refuse to talk to me ; he acts as though he 's quite as eager as I am to get to the bottom of this . That may be his ploy . - And yours ? - To pretend I have many sources . He looked a little startled when I mentioned some connections in Prague and Germany . - And if you go , it would be better if I stayed . He was silent a moment . - It might draw less attention , but then for your safety . . -I no longer care . Various figures were approaching the palace , its ballroom flooded with light , the chandeliers white flames in the windows . The white marble glowing . The tall figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Venus , a cupid holding her train . The costumed figures converge in little streams , the couples ascending the steps under the brilliant lamps . - They come from all over the world for this , Koenig says . And now they watch . The great ones of the world-royalty once more . All the deposed kings and princes , the fragments of old aristocracy , the tatters of old empire together with newly acquired wealth . In all the guises of love : Antony and Cleopatra , Helen and Paris , Eloise and Abelard , Lancelot and Guinevere , the King and Queen of Hearts . All together . At midnight they will have a banquet and dance their love till dawn . <p> Down in the pisceria , where now all the fish have long been cleared away , the butchers ' stalls closed , another dance vibrates into motion . She and Koenigjoin the waves of people converging at the Rialto , flowing over the bridge and into the music . Somewhere from under the arches an accordion reaches her , drums , and clarinets . Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through into the lighted arena , into a whirling throng . The dancers are rollicking to a polka . She and Koenig are surrounded , as some of the throng begin dancing in the street . A moving blur of color , a mixture of the recognizable and the exotic . Old and young-some have masks , some only a piece of costume . A face painted . A cape , a hat , a wig . Pig and bear dance , cock and owl , prostitute and soldier . A whole deck of cards bobs around the floor . <p> They are all dancing , even she and Koenig , an unlikely pair pretending to be lovers . There is only the music , the pulsing crowd . Blood beating in her ears . The music changes , and a long snake forms , one behind the other , each figure holding on the other 's waist and they are led in a bobbing rush . Half falling , trying frantically to keep in step . Moving in a blind impulse , shaken by merriment . Quite infectious . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides pull the men near them into the dance . The snake goes on , fast and faster , furiously , dizzyingly , until hands pull apart , and in the rising crescendo of the music , the snake falls apart altogether , and the dancers , giddy-breathless , laugh into one another 's faces . A jug goes around . Cans of beer . The dancing begins again , but Koenig moves to the outside to smoke a cigar . She turns back to watch . Once again , the costumed figures catch each other round the waist , the snake curves through , catching up more dancers , who grab the end as it curves round , running to keep up . Couples are kissing in the corners , arms entwined ; kissing by the posts . They wander off as others throw themselves into the dance , pressed together in the same rhythm . <p> She has lost sight of Koenig . A man in a huge white mask with a snout and horns grabs a ballerina around the waist and pulls her off . Florrie turns toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man pulls her out onto the floor and she finds herself dancing with a fox . - Et qui est-tu , ma chere ? Lajeune fille ou la fille ? She catches a suggestive laugh . <p> She whirls around . Koenig , where are you ? - Pauvre petite , tu as peur ? A number of spades and some of the clubs , dance between her and her path of escape . She has n't seen any of the hearts and diamonds . Where has he gone ? She turns , and tries to move away , but the fox whirls her around , and her head keeps whirling even when she stops . As though at a signal , the dancers have begun to disperse . Moving quickly , clutching at one another . Everywhere , in doorways , against the beams of the arches , they devour one another . The fox reaches for her , but she runs from the floor , threads her way through the dancers and embracing couples to look for Koenig in the dark tunnel of the street . She nearly runs into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , her legs spread apart . The fox is still in pursuit of her . A great red-wigged woman with enormous breasts and striped socks flounders past : a man , in the company of a woman in a soldier 's uniform . She is frantic now , turning , swerving this way and that . She can not find him . She runs back into the dancers : surely he must have gone inside again to look for her . Turning , working through the dancers , nearly thrown off her feet , she reaches the other side strung with backpacks and piles of coats and jackets , couples on top of them . No , not sitting . Through the slits of the mask , she sees them copulating-writhing and humping , all in one mad movement . The gods did it first . And so the world is made , and continually remade . A grand orgy filled with the chaos of things flying up-masks and birds and glass animals and blood oranges and eels and bears . <p> - Help me find Koenig , she says in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the captured ballerina . Help me . Where are you ? Where ? Help me to escape . You helped me once . -h please , she cries out to an Ace of Hearts . He 's there-I saw him . Under the fox 's skin . <p> - Koenig , where are you ? I saw him . There , there . Ca n't you see . You must see . <p> Through and around . She must run .... Oh please . What is she to do ? When you turn to look around , the footsteps are still at your back . And suddenly Koenig is in front of her . She is ready to weep . - Florrie , I 've been looking for you . -I thought you 'd disappeared . She turns again . No one there . No one . The force , all twisted , perverted . Love-the crescent moon . How easy to see , and lose . Now the voice beating against her chest where the heart used to be hears itself in the void . The heart-taken prisoner and extinguished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw him . <p> - Impossible . He ca n't possibly know our whereabouts . And no one can recognize you . You have your mask . <p> She puts her hand up to her face-three faces . - Oh , she says . And something snaps back . Let her remind herself . The eyes , hollow-blind from love : are n't they the first things stolen ? The face too , hers , taken away . Stolen as well . Sell it for a mask in some shop . Where will she find it again , the missing spark ? What 's yours if you ca n't recognize it ? Something given that you had once . And became your face . <p> She looks at Koenig , the painted tear on his whitened cheek . What is he hiding ? Paint over guilt ? No , just paint . The false tear . Do n't give me any cheap carnival sentiment . <p> Camillo must have been laughing at her when he gave her such a face . How ridiculous innocence was . The prisoner had taught her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the knowledge . Was she going to walk through the world always looking over her shoulder ? <p> It is time to sleep . She tells herself again that Jimmy does n't know where she is , that he is not dancing in the shape of a fox , ready to hunt her down . Koenig told no one they were leaving , though they had to get her a passport at the Embassy . But he sent her on the train ahead of him . Jimmy could n't have known . Ca n't possibly know she is here . Even so-How will she find her way back out of all this madness ? A madness that may have only begun . <p> -I 'm glad the streets are marked , Koenig says . He points to the arrows and signs . They do n't let you get lost here . <p> That 's what they think . <p> Dark and winding street : the minotaur waiting at the end to devour all the youths . Oh , monstrous . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
