JOHNSON V. JOHNSON <P> by Barbara Goldsmith Knopf ; 285 pages ; $18.95 <P> In drugstores , the familiar white boxes say Johnson &; Johnson . But in court the ampersand was changed to versus , and the aim was not to relieve pain but to exacerbate it . One Johnson was Barbara ( " Basia " ) , nee Piasecka , the Polish-born cook-chambermaid who became the third wife of J. Seward Johnson , heir to the pharmaceutical fortune . At the time of their marriage in 1971 , he was 76 , she was 34 . The other Johnson signified J. Seward 's six litigious children from his two previous marriages , excised from the old man 's will shortly before his death in 1983 at the age of 87 .

At the Pacific 's edge , Ann gently nourishes another dream : to outgrow people like her mother , " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the worst ; they are the ones who get your love . " Finally , Adele taunts once too often : " It 's me or nothing , kid . " Ann 's choice stuns them both . <P> Left to herself , Adele is rewarded with the life she always wanted  --  based solely on appearance . She goes " from one perfect outfit to the next . . . Someone could always be watching . " This obsession with surfaces is contagious : First Novelist Simpson also suffers from it . She uses brand names and meticulous descriptions of the ordinary to build an appearance of reality , but beneath the book 's carefully crafted details there is not quite enough of the breath or pulse of life . <P> NURSERY CRIMES <P> by B.M.
