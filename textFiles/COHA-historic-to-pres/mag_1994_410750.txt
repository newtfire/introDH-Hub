Since the 1973 oil embargo , industrial countries have made large gains in using energy more economically . For the 24 member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , energy use rose only one-fifth as much as economic growth . However , these pains largely have bypassed developing countries , where use soared 20% faster than economic expansion during the same period . Developing nation economies now require 40% more energy than industrial ones to produce the same value of goods and services . Part of the difference is due to the fact that these countries still are building energy-intensive infrastructure and related industries  --  but often using outdated technologies that squander energy . These gross inefficiencies  --  whether in wood stoves , cement plants , light bulbs , or trucks  --  offer innumerable opportunities to limit energy consumption and expenditures while expanding the services they provide . For instance , the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment estimates that nearly half of over-all electricity use in the South can be cut cost effectively . To compete in increasingly integrated world markets , while still meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reap the economic savings that improved energy efficiency offers . It will take a concerted effort by consumers , businesses , and governments to capture the full potential . Individual consumers , particularly poorer ones , often can not afford to buy more efficient appliances and have no reason to do so under government policies that subsidize energy , but not efficiency . Manufacturers and importers lack incentives to reduce products ' energy use , even when no additional cost is involved . Meanwhile , governments and international lending agencies usually direct their money and efforts toward simply expanding supplies , while paying little attention to how much heat or power  --  and how much pollution  --  is produced per investment dollar . Half of Third World commercial energy consumption goes to industry . Yet , for each ton of steel or cement produced , the typical factory in the global south uses more energy than its northern counterpart . Steel plants in developing countries , for example , consume roughly one-quarter more energy than the average American one and about three-quarters more than the most efficient . Fertilizer plants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ton of ammonia as a typical British operation does . Pulp and paper facilities consume as much as three times more energy for the same amount of output . Such records often are the result of poor maintenance and operating procedures and can be improved  --  given sufficient information and incentive to do so . Indonesian industries , for example , could cut energy use 11% without any capital investment , simply by changing operating procedures . Similarly , a Ghanaian survey found potential savings of at least 30% in medium- to large-scale industries . Efficiency also is impaired by reliance on old or obsolete industrial processes  --  often purchased at bargain prices from northern countries . Cement plants operate in 84 of 110 developing nations , often ranking as the most energy-consuming industry . These plants typically use 50-100% more energy than the best ones in industrial countries , partially due to reliance on an antiquated wet process . In Kenya , more than two-thirds of the country 's industrial energy goes to making cement . In Tunisia , a government program prompted the modernizing of cement-making in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved by 13% over eight years . Some of the largest opportunities to save energy and money are in the electric power industry . Third World power plants typically burn 20-40% more fuel for each kilowatt-hour generated than those in the north . They also experience far more unplanned shutdowns for repairs , as they often are poorly maintained and operated by inadequately trained staff . Once electricity is generated , 15-20% of it disappears in line losses and theft , as industries and individuals hook into power lines without paying for the service . In some countries , the rates are even higher . Bangladesh reportedly loses more than 40% of its generated power this way . Because the developing world still is in the early stages of building its industrial infrastructure , it has opportunities to base future development not just on more efficient processes , but also on more efficient products . Constructing a $7,500,000 compact fluorescent light bulb factory , for example , would eliminate the need to build $5,600.000,000 worth of coal-fired power plants , if the bulbs ( which need 75% less power than incandescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency would cut $740 in capital expenditure  --  before the savings on energy use even begin . In Pakistan , a switch from incandescent to compact fluorescent bulbs helped Karachi 's Aga Khan Hospital cut its energy consumption 20% . A $10,000,000 factory making advanced windows for commercial buildings would offset $4,600,000,000 worth of power plants . Such a strategy also would generate products for which there is high international demand . With compact fluorescent bulbs  --  already manufactured in Brazil , Mexico , Taiwan , China , and Sri Lanka  --  a global demand grew by 36% per year over the past two years . In North America , Europe , and Asia , demand now exceeds supply . UNFORESEEN IMPACTS The emphasis on energy-intensive industrialization typically found in developing countries can have unforeseen impacts on economies already burdened by under-employment and debt . In Brazil , for instance , the government subsidizes electricity for energy-intensive industries such as aluminum smelting ( which pays just one-third the actual cost of producing power ) to boost exports that can service its foreign debt . As a result , the government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams to supply power to the smelters and other plants . A move toward lighter industries , such as computers , could create 120 times as many jobs and generate 20 times as much tax revenue as a similar investment in energy-intensive , export-oriented industries such as aluminum . A similar situation exists in Karnataka , India , where metal-producing plants ( primarily steel and aluminum ) make up 69% of the industrial power consumption , yet provide just nine percent of industrial employment . Indeed , some economists question the entire notion of economic development based on resource-and energy-intensive industrialization . In agriculture , too , there is an urgent need for movement toward greater energy efficiency , particularly in view of the fact that agricultural inputs in the Third World  --  including fertilizers , pesticides , irrigation , tractors , and processing  --  are expected to become more energy-intensive as population growth drives up the demand for food . In China , chemical fertilizer use has gone up 140% since the late 1970s , while grain production has increased only 26% . Still further increases in fertilizer utilization are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing countries can increase agricultural output while keeping expensive , energy-intensive inputs to a minimum . In China and India , for instance , the ratio of nitrogen fertilizer to potassium and phosphorus fertilizers far exceeds that found in other countries , suggesting that much of the nitrogen fertilizer is not being incorporated optimally by plants . In India , researchers have developed a form of nitrogen fertilizer that provides better delivery to crop roots , allowing a 35% reduction in fertilizer applied . In the U.S. , researchers have shown that mechanical tillage in corn and soybeans is less expensive and energy-intensive ( while more labor-intensive ) than chemical weed control . Agriculture is energy-intensive not only because of its demand for chemicals , but because it is  --  in some developing countries  --  a large consumer of electricity . India 's 8,000,000 irrigation pumps use nearly one-quarter of the country 's electricity , employ inefficient motors and poorly designed belts , and are plagued by leaky foot valves and high friction losses . More efficient pumps could cut electricity consumption by roughly half , at a cost of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs for electricity generally are so low , farmers have no incentive to conserve energy . Even so , one retrofit program conducted by the Indian Rural Electrification Corporation in the mid 1980s reduced electricity consumption in 23,000 pumps by 25% , and the improvements paid for themselves in less than six months . Similar results have been achieved in Pakistan , another nation that relies heavily on electric pumps for irrigation . Although industry and agriculture consume most of the commercial energy in developing countries , the urban residential and commercial sectors are expanding much faster . In Thailand , 40% of the projected increase in electricity growth is for commercial buildings . Heating water and cooking still are the primary energy uses in urban and rural households , but most of the growth is in electricity-consuming products such as lights , televisions , refrigerators , and air conditioners . In China , just three percent of Beijing 's households had refrigerators in 1982 ; six years later , 81% did . Lighting alone accounts for one-third of India 's peak electricity demand and one-sixth of its total electricity consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing countries often rely on outdated technologies that expend more energy than needed . A typical Chinese refrigerator , for example , uses 365 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year , whereas a similarly sized South Korean model uses 240 kilowatt-hours and a Danish one needs less than 100 kilowatt-hours . Yet , industrial planners and manufacturers in developing countries rarely are concerned with the energy efficiency of their products  --  only with producing and selling more of them by keeping the initial cost as low as possible . The same can be said of architects and civil engineers . Much of the developing world relies on air conditioning in commercial buildings . Improved designs  --  including insulation , better windows , and natural ventilation  --  could cut cooling needs and costs , but such designs are not used widely . In Bangkok , large offices typically use windows made of a single sheet of glass . By substituting advanced double-paned windows with a special low-emissivity coating ( which filters out infrared rays , but allows in visible light ) , builders would reduce not only the subsequent electricity costs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to install smaller , less expensive air conditioning units . While it is preferable to make such substitutions during construction  --  when developing nations are building their infrastructure  --  it is possible to upgrade existing structures instead . Chinese buildings use three times as much energy for heating as comparable U.S. ones , even though inside temperatures remain colder . By making boiler improvements and using insulation and double-glazed windows , the Chinese could raise average building temperatures from 11deg Celsius to 18deg  --  while consuming 40% less coal . One study found that such modifications can pay for themselves in 6.5 years in the northern city of Harbin even with subsidized coal ; with unsubsidized coal , the payback would be around four years . Efficiency improvements also can be made in the use of biomass  --  wood , charcoal , or agricultural residues  --  for cooking , allowing women to spend less time or money acquiring fuel . Traditional Third World stoves operate at an efficiency level of around 10% , but modern ones can convert 20-30% of the fuel to useful cooking energy . Similar gains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban markets or rural industries . During the 1970s , development organizations put a high priority on improving cooking stoves , but , because of problems with reliability and affordability , the new ones did not catch on at first . That situation is changing , however . In Kenya , an improved charcoal stove  --  the ceramic jiko  --  has become a major success . More than 500,000 have been sold , with at least 130,000 being added each year . Kenya 's success has helped to inspire similar programs in 15 other African countries , with approximately 150,000 more efficient stoves sold in Niger and 200,000 in Burkina Faso . TRANSPORTATION Another area of rapidly growing energy consumption in developing countries is transportation . In most , this sector accounts for over one-half of total oil consumption and one-third of commercial energy use . Much of the increase has been caused by the rapid growth in urbanization and ownership of cars and two-or three-wheel motor vehicles . During the past decade , car registrations shot up in Asian developing countries by more than 10% annually . Meanwhile , two- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Motor vehicles made in developing countries often fall below the efficiency levels found in the north . New cars manufactured in Brazil , for instance , are 20-30% less efficient than comparable models made in Europe and Japan . Moreover , prototype vehicles built in the industrial world can quadruple the current level of efficiency . For buses and trucks , which consume more petroleum over all than private automobiles in developing nations , gains also are feasible , though less dramatic . By switching to improved engines that are produced domestically , new Indian buses can be made up to 20% more efficient . The engine pays for itself in saved fuel in three years . Further efficiency gains can be achieved through more extensive training of drivers and vehicle maintenance workers . The growing automotive congestion in many Third World cities can negate even these vast gains , however . Congestion in Bangkok has dropped the average vehicle speed from 12 kilometers per hour in 1980 to an estimated five today . More serious measures are needed to improve transportation of people and goods , including more efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future land use activities . In particular , promoting the continued large-scale utilization of bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles would reduce future motorized vehicle energy use , air and noise pollution , and traffic congestion , while boosting employment and mobility of the poor . Fully occupied buses , for instance , use as little as one-sixth as much energy per passenger as automobiles . Curitiba , Brazil , relies on a network of feeder and express buses that utilize dedicated traffic lanes , providing riders with fast and convenient trips , with minimal petroleum use . Singapore has made transportation efficiency a priority in its urban planning , taxing both ownership of cars and use of roads to increase reliance on mass transit . In combination , the efficiency potentials within reach for industry , agriculture , buildings , and transportation could provide an enormous boost to the economies of developing nations . By investing $10,000,000,000 a year , these countries could cut future growth of their energy demand by half , lighten the burden of pollution on their environments and health , and staunch the flow of export earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 35 years , according to a study prepared by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for the U.S. Working Group on Global Energy Efficiency . Although such wide-scale savings remain paper prophecies , some countries have had notable successes . In 1980 , China launched an ambitious efficiency program to improve energy use in major industries . By directing roughly 10% of its energy investment to efficiency over five years , the nation cut its annual growth in over-all energy use from seven to four percent without slowing growth in industrial production . Better efficiency accounted for more than 90% of the energy savings , with shifts toward less energy-intensive industries yielding the remainder . Efficiency gains were found to be one-third less expensive than comparable investments in coal supplies . One result was that China 's energy consumption expanded at less than half the rate of economic growth from 1980 through 1988 . China achieved this in the midst of building its infrastructure , a phase of industrialization that , in most countries , has involved soaring energy consumption . Had the nation failed to make such progress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it actually was . Yet , China has poured money into expanding its energy supply since the mid 1980s , while spending on efficiency has declined to just six percent of total investment in the energy sector . Brazil 's National Electricity Conservation Program has catalyzed impressive savings of energy and money . The $20,000,000 it spent over four years was spread over more than 150 efficiency projects and programs , with local governments and private industry providing matching funds . Most of the money went to information , education , and promotion programs to increase awareness of the savings efficiency could generate . It also encouraged the National Development Bank to offer low-interest loans to those businesses willing to invest in efficiency . These efforts yielded electricity savings worth between $600,000,000 and $1,300,000,000 in reduced need for power plants and transmission lines . By making broader investments , Brazil cost effectively could eliminate 42% of its projected growth in electricity consumption by 2010 , estimates Howard Geller , executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy , who has studied the Brazilian energy sector . This reduction would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electric motors , and air conditioning . Brazil and China need not be anomalies , as similar potential exists throughout the developing world . Halving the rate at which the Third World 's energy demand grows over the next 30 years would hold the overall increase to a doubling , rather than tripling , of consumption . That difference could have incalcuable consequences for environmental and human health worldwide  --  and for the ability of the developing world to meet the basic needs of its burgeoning population .
