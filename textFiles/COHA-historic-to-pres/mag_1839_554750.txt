MR . COOPER has made a valuable addition to the history of the country , in the work before us . He appears to have used a commendable diligence in searching out whatever facts our early history affords , illustrative of the origin and growth of the national navy , and has dressed them out in a form as attractive , perhaps , as the unconnected nature of the events , and the meagreness of the annals from which he derived his materials , permitted . With the exception of a few irregular exploits , and the more remarkable engagement of Paul Jones , in the Bon Homme Richard , in the revolutionary war , together with the capture of the Insurgent , by Commodore Truxton , in the Constellation , dunn our naval hostilities with France , in 1799 , but few incidents occurred at those periods , of sufficient importance to come down to us with much minuteness of detail . These are all narrated by Mr. Cooper with sufficient clearness and vivacity . Our navy , both as it regards its ships and officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , from its first creation , during the revolutionary contest , until the commencement of the war against Tripoli . On the breaking out of that war , it was put on a more permanent and respectable footing , than it had hitherto obtained ; and , in the course of it , the foundation of that character , which it formed for itself in the late war with England , was laid in the brilliant actions of Preble , Decatur , and Somers . Most of the officers , who became distinguished during the last war , commenced their career at Tripoli , and received their early professional impressions in a school , which has conferred the deepest obligations on the Navy , and on the country . The burning of the frigate Philadelphia , during this war , may , indeed , be justly rated among the most brilliant achievements of the navy . It is described by Mr. Cooper in his best style , and we very reluctantly forego the pleasure of transferring it to our pages . We also intended , had our limits allowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks on the gunboats and batteries of Tripoli , in August , 1804 ; a sketch which conveys a very lively idea of the desperate courage // evinced by the officers of our young navy throughout the whole of that struggle . In approaching nearer our own times , the incidents of the late war with England , for the naval history of which more abundant materials exist , are narrated with greater detail . Among the earliest events recorded by our author , is the escape of the Constitution , under Commodore Isaac Hull , from a fleet of British ships , in July , 1812 . The story itself , and the style of its narrator , are both so spirited , that we can not deny ourselves the satisfaction of laying it before our readers . " As the day opened , three sail were discovered on the starboard quarter of the Constitution , and three more astern . This was the squadron of Commodore Broke , which had been gradually closing with the American frigate during the night , and was now just out of gunshot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mists were entirely cleared away , the Constitution had two frigates on her lee quarter , and a ship of the line , two frigates , a brig , and a schooner astern . All the strangers had English colors flying . " It now fell quite cairn , and the Constitution hoisted out her boats , and sent them ahead to tow , with a view to keep the ship out of the reach of the enemy 's shot . At the same time , she whipt up one of the main deck guns to the spar deck , and run it out aft , as a stern chaser , getting a long eighteen off the forecastle , also , for a similar purpose . Two more of the twentyfours below were run out of the cabin windows , with the same object , though it was found necessary to cut away some of the wood-work of the stern frame , in order to make room . " By six o'clock , the wind , which continued very light and baffling , came out from the northward of west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southward , and all the light canvass , that would draw , was set . Soon after , the nearest frigate , the Shannon , opened with her bow guns , and continued firing for about ten minutes , but , perceiving she could not reach the Constitution , she ceased . At half past six , Captain Hull sounded in twenty-six fathoms , when , finding that the enemy was likely to close , as he was enabled to put the boats of two ships on one , and was also favored by a little more air than the Constitution , all the spare rope that could be found , and which was fit for the purpose , was payed down into the cutters , bent on , and a kedge was run out , near half a mile ahead , and let go . At a signal given , the crew clapped on , and walked away with the ship , overrunning and tripping the kedge , as she came up with the end of the line . While this was doing , fresh lines and another // kedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight of land , the frigate had glided away from her pursuers , before they discovered the manner in which it was done . It was not long , however , before the enemy resorted to the same expedient . At half past seven , the Constitution had a little air , when she set her ensign , and fired a shot at the Shannon , the nearest ship astern . At eight , it fell calm again , and further recourse was had to the boats and the kedges , the enemy 's vessels having a light air , and drawing ahead , towing , sweeping , and kedging . By nine , the nearest frigate , the Shannon , on which the English had put most of their boats , was closing fast , and there was every prospect , notwithstanding the steadiness and activity of the Constitution 's people , that the frigate just mentioned , would get near enough to cripple her , when her capture by the rest of the squadron would be inevitable . At this trying moment , the best spirit prevailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hull was not without hopes , even should he be forced into action , of throwing the Shannon astern by his fire , arid of maintaining his distance from the other vessels . It was known that the enemy could not tow very near , as it would have been easy to sink his boats with the stern guns of the Constitution , and not a man in the latter vessel showed a disposition to despondency . Officers and men relieved each other regularly at the duty , and , while the former threw themselves down on deck to catch short naps , the people slept at their guns . This was one of the most critical moments of the chase . The Shannon was fast closing , as has been just stated , while the Guerriere was about as near on the larboard quarter . An hour promised to bring the struggle to an issue , when , suddenly , at nine minutes past nine , a light air from the southward struck the ship , bringing her to windward . The beautiful manner in which this advantage was iml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the breeze was seen corning , the ship 's sails were trimmed , and , as soon as she was under command , she was brought close up to the wind , on the larboard tack ; the boats were all dropped in alongside ; those that belonged to the davits were run up , while the others were just lifted clear of the water , by purchases on the spare spars , stowed outboard , where they were in readiness to be used again at a moment 's notice . As the ship came by the wind , she brought the Guerriere nearly on her lee beam , when that frigate opened a fire from her broadside . While the shot of this vessel were just falling short of them , the people of the Constitution were hoisting up their boats , with as much steadiness as if the duty was performing in a friendly port . In about // an hour , however , it fell nearly calm again , when Captain Hull ordered a quantity of the water started , to lighten the ship . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats were sent ahead again to tow . The enemy now put nearly all his boats on the Shannon , the nearest ship astern and a few hours of prodigious exertion followed , the people of the Constitution being compelled to supply the place of nurnhers by their activity and zeal . The ships were close by the wind , and every thing that would draw was set , and the Shannon was slowly , but steadily , forging ahead . About noon , of this day , there was a little relaxation from labor , owing to the occasional occurrence of cat 's paws , by watching which closely , the ship was urged through the water . But , at a quarter past twelve , the boats were again sent ahead , and the toilsome work of towing and kedging was renewed . " At one o'clock , a strange sail was discovered , nearly to leeward . At this moment , the four frigates of the enemy were about one point on the lee quarter of the Constitution , at long gunshot , the Africa , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind was constantly baffling , any moment might have brought a change , and placed the enemy to windward . At seven minutes before two , the Belvidere , then the nearest ship , began to fire with her bow guns , and the Constitution opened with her stern chasers . On board the latter ship , however , it was soon found to be dangerous to use the main deck guns , the transoms having so much rake , the windows being so high , and the guns so short , that every explosion lifted the upper deck , and threatened to blow out the stern frame . Perceiving , moreover , that his shot did little or no execution , Captain Hull ordered the firing to cease at half past two . " For several hours , the enemies ' frigates were now within gunshot , sometimes towing and kedging , and at others endeavouring to close with the puffs of air that occasionally passed . At seven in the evening , the boats of the Constitution were again ahead , the ship steering southwest half west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At half past seven she sounded in twenty-four fathoms . For four hours , the same toilsome duties were going on , until a little before eleven , when a light air from the southward struck the ship , and the sails , for the first time in many weary hours , were asleep . The boats instantly dropped along side , hooked on , and were all run up , with the exception of the first cutter . The top-gallant studding-sails and stay-sails were set as soon as possible , and , for about *n hour , the people caught a little rest . " But at midnight it fell nearly calm again , though neither // the pursuers nor the pursued had recourse to the boats , probably from an unwillingness to disturb their crews . At two , A. M. , it was observed , on board the Constitution , that the Guerriere had forged ahead , and was again off their lee beam . At this time the top-gallant studding-sails were taken in . " In this manner passed the night , and on the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enemy 's frigates were within long gunshot on the lee quarter , and the other at about the same distance on the lee beam . The Africa and the prizes were much further to leeward . " A little after daylight , the Guerriere , having drawn ahead sufficiently to be forward of the Constitution 's beam , tacked , when the latter ship did the same , in order to preserve her position to windward . An hour later the ZEolus passed on the contrary tack so near , that it was thought by some , who observed the movement , that she ought to have opened her fire but , as that vessel was merely a twelve pounder frigate , and she was still at a considerable distance , it is quite probabie her commander acted judiciously . By this time , there was sufficient wind to induce Captain Hull to hoist in his first cutter . " The scene , on the morning of this day , was very beautiful , and of great interest to the lovers of nautical exhibitions . The weather was mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was quite wind enough to remove the necessity of any of the extraordinary means of getting ahead , that had been so freely used during the previous eight-and-forty hours . All the English vessels had got on the same tack with the Constitution again , and the five frigates wore clouds of canvass from their trucks to the water . Including the American ship , eleven sail were in sight , and , shortly after , a twelfth appeared to windward , that was soon ascertained to be an American merchantmen . But the enemy were too intent on the Constitution , to regard any thing else , and , though it would have been easy to capture the ships to leeward , no attention appears to have been paid to them . With a view , however , to deceive the ship to windward , they hoisted American colors , when the Constitution set an English ensign , by way of warning the stranger to keep aloof . " " At meridian the wind began to blow a pleasant breeze , and the sound of the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . From this moment the noble old ship slowly drew ahead of all her pursuers , the sails being watched and tended in the best manner that consummate seamanship could dictate , until four , P. M. , when the Belvidere was more than four miles astern , and the other vessels were thrown // behind in the same proportion , though the wind had again got to be very light . " In this manner both parties kept pressing ahead and to windward , as fast as circumstances would allow , profiting by every change , and resorting to all the means of forcing vessels through the water , that are known to seamen . At a little before seven , however , there was every appearance of a heavy squall , accompanied by rain ; when the Constitution prepnred to meet it with the coolness and discretion she had displayed throughout the whole affair . The people were stationed , and every thing was kept fast to the last moment , when , just before the squall struck the ship , the order was given to clew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a second reef was taken in the mizen topsail , and the ship was brought under short sail , in an incredibly little time . The English vessels , observing this , began to let go and haul down without waiting for the wind , and , when they were shut in by the rain , they were steering in different directions to avoid the force of the expected squall . The Constitution , on the other hand , no sooner got its weight , than she sheeted home and hoisted her fore and main top-gallant sails , and while the enemy most probably believed her to be borne down by the pressure of the wind , steering free , she was flying away from them , on an easy bowline , at the rate of eleven knots . " " Thus terminated a chase , that has become historical in the American Navy , for its length , closeness , and activity . On the part of the English , there were manifested much perseverance and seamanship , a ready imitation , and a strong desire to get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair was carried off by the officers and people of the Constitution . Throughout all the trying circumstances of this arduous struggle , this noble frigate , which had so lately been the subject of the sneers of the English critics , maintained the high character of a man-of-war . Even when pressed upon the hardest , nothing was hurried , confused , or slovenly , but the utmost steadiness , order , and discipline reigned in the ship . " - Vol. ii . pp. 155- 162 . The sequel of the naval events of the late war with England is related , in the course of the second volume of Mr. Cooper 's work , with an ability corresponding with that of the description which we have quoted above . In interest , indeed , the second volume very far exceeds the first , owing , in part , to the more abundant materials within reach of the author , and also , in some degree , to the facts being familiar // to many of us , and having made a deep impression upon our minds at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work , describing our naval battles with England , is characterized by a remarkable tone of liberality towards that country , which compares most advantageously with those portions of the works of Brenton and James , in which the same events are described . We are not , indeed , without the apprehension , that Mr. Cooper 's unwillingness to claim too much credit for our triumphs in this brilliant , though unequal struggle , may have led him to he more than just to England . That he has been so in one instance , and in that instance to the prejudice and depreciation of one of the most glorious of all our naval achievements , is too manifest . We allude to the battle of Lake Erie . He seems , moreover , to have labored to convey an unfair impression of the relative exertions of Commodore Perry and of Captain Elliott , his second in command , during the battle . The controversy , which he thus brings up , is not of our seeking . It is of so personal a nature , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consistently with critical honesty . But it is forced upon whoever undertakes to comment upon Mr. Cooper 's book ; and , however disagreeable the task thus imposed , we can not be so indifferent to the truth respecting one of the most brilliant exploits , nor so unjust to one of the most glorious names , in our naval annals , as to permit what we regard as gross misrepresentations concerning them to pass , without remonstrance of ours , into accredited history . Our limits do not permit us to quote the whole of Mr. Cooper 's account of this battle , as , with the comments which we propose to make on it , our article would be so far extended as to exclude the few hints on the condition and prospects of the navy , with which we propose to conclude our task . By citing the pages in which we are called upon to correct errors , the reader , with the work before him , will he able to follow and appreciate the justness of our commentary . As a first instance , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to commend and highly estimate the merits of Commodore Perry , may be detected , we would call attention to the fact , that , after having stated , on page 3S9 , Volume II. , the circumstances attending the removal of the heavy vessels over the har of Erie harbour , he fails to com // mend the seamanlike skill , ingenuity , and great despatch , with which that operation was performed , whilst , in all similar cases throughout the course of his work , even where far inferior interests are at stake , he evinces a lively perception of the merit displayed , and never fails to commend it strongly . In order to elucidate the unfairness of Mr. Cooper 's account of the hattie , we will first copy his description of the relative position of the two squadrons at the time the action began . " Captain Barclay ( the British commander ) had formed his line with the Chippeway , Mr. Campbell , armed with one gun on a pivot , in the van ; the Detroit , his own vessel , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Finnis ; Lady Prevost , Lieutenant-Commandant Buchan and Little Belt , astern , in the order named . To oppose this line , the Arid , of four long twelves , was stationed in the van , arid the Scorpion , of one long and one short gun on circles , next her . The Lawrence , Captain Perry , came next the two schooners just mentioned keeping on her weather bow , having no quarters . The Caledonia , Lieutenant Turner , was the next astern , and the Niagara , Captain Elliott , was placed next to the Caledonia . These vessels were all up at the time , but the other light craft were more or less distant , each endeavouring to get into her berth . The order of battle for the remaining vessels , directed the Tigress to fall in astern of the Niagara , the Somers next , and the Porcupine and Trippe in the order named . " - Vol. ii . pp. 391 , 392 . Mr. Cooper subsequently states , that " the order of battle required them to form within half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Niagara was , as he states , in her station immediately before the action commenced , it follows , that she was only one cable 's length astern of the Lawrence . Very soon after this , the action commenced with a shot from the Detroit at the Lawrence ; still the Niagara was in her station and within hail , for at this time Commodore Perry ordered the word to be passed by trumpet , through Captain Elliot , for the squadron to close , as before prescribed , to half cable-length 's distance . Mr. Cooper does not mention the material fact , that this word was passed , through Captain Elliott , after the action commenced ; not does he mention the equally material fact , that signal was now made for each vessel to engage her opponent , as designated in previous orders . Now the designated opponent of the Niagara was the Queen // Charlotte , a fact which Mr. Cooper mentions at the commencement of his account of the engagement , but does not advert to afterwards , when it was seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as Captain Elliott remained on hoard of her . We are told ( p. 393 ) , that the action commenced a few minutes before meridian , when the Niagara was hailed from the Lawrence , and the signal made for each vessel to engage her opponent , as previously designated . Mr. Cooper goes on to state . " At this moment , the American vessels , in line , were edg. * ing down upon the English , those in van being necessarily nearer to the enemy than those astern of them , with the exception of the Arid and Scorpion , which two schooners had been ordered to keep to windward of the Lawrence . As the Detroit had an armament of long guns , Captain Barclay manifested his judgment in commencing the action in this manner , and , in a short time , the firing between that ship , the Lawrence , and the two schooners at the head of the American line , became animated . A few minutes later , the vessels astern began to fire , and the action became general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the principal aim of the enemy , and , before the fire had lasted any material time , the Detroit , Hunter , and Queen Charlotte , were directing most of their efforts against her . The American brig endeavoured to close , and did succeed in getting within reach of canister , though not without suffering materially , as she fanned down upon the enemy . At this time , the su pportof the two schooners ahead , which were well commanded and fought , was of the greatest moment to her , for the vessels astern , though in the line , could be of little use in diverting the fire , on account of their positions and distance . " - Vol. ii . p. 393 . Where was the Niagara at this time , that she could not engage her designated opponent , the seventeen-gun ship Queen Charlotte , and thus relieve the Commodore , and assume her proper share in this unequal combat ? if the Lawrence " did succeed in getting within reach of canister , though not without suffering materially , as she fanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niagara , which , a few moments before , had answered a hail from the Commodore , and which had not , as yet , " suffered materially , " or at all , also " fan down " to relieve her sorely pressed Commo // dore , and assail the Queen Charlotte , which , Mr. Cooper tells us , the Niagara had been destined specially to " lie against " ? If " the support of the two schooners ahead , " which " were well commanded and fought , " though they mounted together only six guns , " was of the greatest momei*t " to the Lawrence , of how much greater moment would the support of the Niagara have been , had she , mounting twenty guns , been also " well commanded and fought " Mr. Cooper next tells us , that " After the fire had lasted some time , the Niagara hailed the Caledonia , and directed the latter to make room for the hrig to pass ahead . Mr. Turner put his helm up in the most dashing manner , and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his line , perhaps , than the commanding vessel ; keeping up as warm a fire as his small armament would allow . The Niagara now became the vessel next astern of the Lawrence . " - Vol. ii . pp. 393 , 394 . Here was conduct worthy of IDaniel Turner , worthy of the noble fellow-townsman under whom he served . Convert Mr. Cooper 's " perhaps " into a certainty , and admit that Lieutenant Turner was closer to the enemy 's line than his commander ; if Lieutenant Turner , in the little Caledonia , of three guns , did not hesitate to " put his helm up in the most dashing manner , and continue to near the enemy , until he was closer to his line , perhaps , than the commanding vessel , keeping up as xvarm a fire as his small armament would allow , " why could not Captain Elliott , in the Niagara , of twenty guns , being so near to the Caledonia as to be embarrassed by her movements , have " put his helm up , " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " closer to the enemy " than the commanding vessel , and broadside and broadside with the ship which he had been destined " to lie against " ? This would have been in strict conformity with the last words of Commodore Perry to his commanders , while delivering them their written orders on the eve of the battle , ( and to which Mr. Cooper nowhere adverts , ) telling them , that he could not advise them better , than , in the words of Lord Nelson , " If you lay your enemy alongside , yon can not be out of your place . " But Captain Elliott , in the Niagara , did not imitate Lieutenant Turner 's " most dashing manner " of bearing up . On the contrary , the effect of his order , given in violation of the order of battle fixed by the // Commodore , was to place the Caledonia between him and the enemy , instead of leaving this small vessel , unprotected by bulwarks , partially under cover of his bow , as the Ariel and Scorpion were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little singular , that Mr. Cooper , having thus shown a true taste for what is noble in a naval officer , by eulogizing Lieutenant Turner for the dashing manner in which he bore down upon the enemy , should subsequently commend Captain Elliott for the directly opposite conduct of hauling up and keeping at long shots , and partially under cover , when be says ( p. 402 ) , " By steering for the head of the enemy 's line , the latter was prevented from gaining the wind by tacking ; and , when Captain Elliott imitated this mano*uvre in the Niagara , the American squadron had a very commanding position , of which Captain Perry promptly availed himself . " Lieutenant Turner is commended for dashing into the thickest of the fight , Captain Elliott for changing his Commodore 's order of battle , and hauling out of it . Taking " a very commanding position " without the reach of danger , is mentioned with the same tone of commendation , and in the same paragraph , as rushing into the midst of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The effect of the cannonade was necessarily to deaden the wind , and for nearly two hours there was very little air . During all this time , the weight of the enemy 's fire continued to be directed at the Lawrence ; even the Queen Charlotte , having filled , passed the Hunter , and got under the stern of the Detroit , where she kept up a destructive cannonade on this devoted vessel . The effect of these united attacks , besides producing a great slaughter on board the Lawrence , was nearly to dismantle her , and at the end of two hours and a half agreeably to Captain Perry 's report , the British vessels having filled , and the wind beginning to increase , the two squadrons moved slowly ahead , the Lawrence necessarily dropping astern , and partially out of the conibat . At this moment the Niagara passed to the westward , a short distance to the windward of the Lawrence , steering for the head of the enemy 's line , and the Caledonia followed , to leeward . " - Vol. it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Niagara hailed the Caledonia , " and gave the order which led Lieutenant Turner to " put his helm up , in the most dashing manner , " to run down upon the enemy , he merely informs us , that " the // Niagara now became the next vessel to the Lawrence . " He leaves us under the impression , that the Niagara was in a position to take her fair share in the fight . It is only at the close of the next paragraph , that the initiated may dimly discover what became of the Niagara , when the Caledonia bore up to make room for her . " The Niagara passed to the westward , a short distance to the windward of the Lawrence , steering for the head of the enemy 's line , and the Caledonia followed , to leeward . " In the language of the land , this means simply , that the Caledonia passed hetween the enemy and her disabled Commodore , offering such feeble succour as she was able , whilst the stout Niagara placed the Commodore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy , as a double shield of protection . This is the true meaning of Mr. Cooper 's own account ; we might cite doenmeats which Mr. Cooper has failed to use , to show , that , at this time , the Niagara lay to , with her main top-sail to the mast , and her gih brailed up , having the Lawrence between her and the enemy . During two mortal hours , then , " the weight of the enemy 's fire continued to he directed at the Lawrence ; even the Queen Charlotte , having filled , passed the Hunter , and got under the stern of the Detroit , where she kept up a destructive cannonade on this devoted vessel . " And the Niagara , which had been destined " to lie against " the Queen Charlotte ,  - -  which might so easily have followed the little Caledonia into the thickest of the fight , - and which should rather have shown her the way thither , had been withdrawn hy her commander , so as to make a cover of the devoted vessel , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in obedience to every noble prompting of an officer and a man , have hastened to rescue . The Laxvrence , abandoned by her consort , and left to struggle , single-handed , with the whole British fleet , had been utterly cut to pieces ; twenty-two of her crew were killed , and sixty-one wounded . Only one gun could still he used on hoard of her , and the services of her noble commander were necessary to load and fire that one . The hattie seemed to all to he lost , and the British seamen were already cheering for their anticipated triumph . Perry had fought nobly , and might well have shared the necessary fate of his vessel , leaving the responsibility and disgrace of defeat // to the unworthy associate , who had done every thing to secure it , when the day was again retrieved and won , by as noble an inspiration as naval history , through all times and ages , can afford . It was in this apparently hopeless moment of the battle , that the second lieutenant of the Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That brig ( the Niagara ) will not help us ; see how he keeps off ; he will not come to close action . " " I 'll fetch him up , " said Commodore Perry . He ordered his boat to be manned , and , as he shoved off from the Lawrence , said , " If a victory is to he gained , I 11 gain it ! " And well did he redeem his words ; for , perhaps , of no naval battle may it be so truly said , that it was won by the personal exertions of the commander . How different the handling of the Niagara by Captain Elliott and by Commodore Perry . Under the former , at long shots , or under the protection of the Lawrence and Caledonia , and part of the time hove to and motionless , with her main top-sail to the mast , and jib brailed up , seeking after the " very commanding position , " which Mr. Cooper eulogizes ; under Commodore Perry , changing her course eight points , or a whole right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail , to encounter , not merely that Queen Charlotte , her opponent , which she had hitherto so successfully avoided , but the whole British fleet . Clear of her first commander , who had volunteered to go away from the scene of action , to brin gup the small vessels , which were at a distance from the fight , the Niagara seems instinct with a new life . But we will let Mr. Cooper tell the tale , as here the facts are not susceptible of mystification . " At this critical moment , the Niagara came steadily down , within half pistol shot of the enemy , standing between the Chippeway and Lady Prevost , on one side , and the Detroit , Queen Charlotte , and Hunter , on the other . In passing , she poured in her broadsides , starboard and larboard , ranged ahead of the ships , luffed athwart their bows , and continued delivering a close and deadly fire . The shrieks from the Detroit proved that the tide of battle had turned . At the same moment , the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and canister , astern . A conflict so fearfully close , and so deadly , was necessarily short . In fifteen or twenty minutes after the Niagara bore up , a hail was passed , among the small vessels , that the enemy had struck , and an officer of the Queen Charlotte appeared on the taifrail of that ship , waving a white handkerchief , bent to a boarding-pike. " - Vol. ii . pp. 395 , 396. // It was in this way , that the battle of Lake Erie was won , eminently , by the exertions of Commodore Perry , and equally so , in defiance of the studious want of exertion of Captain Elliott , his second in command . Yet we find , in a work , professing to give a faithful history of the American Navy , a disposition to disparage this , its most glorious event , and to distribute equal meeds of fame to the noble chief , who achieved it mainly by his own personal exertions , and the unworthy coadjutor , who did all that depended upon him to frustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of this victory , we will cite the fact , that the relative force of the two squadrons is not correctly stated by Mr. Cooper . He says , in his review of the battle " It is not easy , to make a just comparison between the forces of the hostile squadrons , on this occasion . Under some circumstances , the Americans would have been materially superior , while , in others , the enemy might possess the advantage , in , perhaps , an equal degree . In those , under which the action was actually fought , the peculiar advantages , and disadvantages , were nearly equalized , the lightness of the wind preventing either of the two largest of the American vessels from profiting by their peculiar mode of efficiency , until quite near the close of the engagement , and particularly favoring the armament of the Detroit ; while the smoothness of the water rendered the light vessels of the Americans very destructive , as soon as they could be got within a proper range . The Detroit has been represented , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , than either of the American brigs , and the Queen Charlotte proved to be a much finer vessel , than had been expected ; while the Lady Prevost was found to be a large warlike schooner . It was , perhaps , unfortunate for the enemy , that the armaments of these two vessels were not available , under the circumstances which rendered the Detroit so efficient , as it destroyed the unity of their efforts . In short , the battle , for near half its duration , appears to have been fought , so far as efficiency was concerned , by the long guns of the two squadrons . This was particularly favoring the Detroit , and the American gun vessels , while the latter fought under the advantage of smooth water , and the disadvantage of having no quarters . The sides of the Detroit , which were unusually stout , were filled with shot , that did not penetrate . In the number of men at quarters , there could have been no great disparity in the two squadrons . " - Vol. mm. pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this web of opposing evidence and contending opinions , the conclusion would rather remain , ( even without taking into the account , that the writer is a countryman of ours , sufficiently patriotic to have won for himself the cognomen of " American , " ) that the American force was in no respect inferior , in ships and men , to the British . The facts are quite otherwise . In the account of the British force , where it is presented collectively by Mr. Cooper , the vessels , composing it , have an armament of fiftynine guns . Subsequently , the Chippeway and Little Belt , not enumerated in this list , are found taking part in the action ; the Chippeway is there stated to have had one gun , but the armament of the Little Belt is not mentioned . As we know , from other sources than Mr. Cooper 's book , that the British force consisted of sixty-three guns , we infer , that the additional three were mounted on the Little Belt . The American force , as enumerated by Mr. Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels contained on the list , the Ohio , of one gun , was absent from the action , on distant service . Thus it strangely happens , that , in the general enumeration of the opposing squadrons , from which almost every reader would receive his abiding impression of their relative forces , two British vessels are omitted , which appear as taking part in the action , while , on the contrary , one American vessel is enumerated , which did not take part in it . Even Brenton , so prejudiced in all his accounts of the naval actions between England and the United States , admits , that , " in number and weight of guns , the two squadrons were nearly equal : but the Americans had every advantage in the number and quality of the men . " The facts of the case , with regard to the relative numbers of guns and men , ( and , as these facts can not be gleaned from Mr. Cooper 's book , we the rather mention them , ) are simply these . The British squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-three guns ; the American squadron consisted of nine vessels , mounting fiftyfour guns . With regard to the absence of any great disparity of men , stated by Mr. Cooper , it is sufficient to cite the fact mentioned by Commodore Perry , in writing to General Harrison , that the number of British prisoners taken on the occasion , exceeded that of the Americans , who went originally into action . Mr. Cooper 's criticism of this battle ( p. 402 ) is written // with a very different spirit from that , with which he eulogizes other victories , far less suited to excite the enthusiasm of an American . He states objections , that have been made to Captain Perry 's mode of attack , and then argues with so little zeal , in refutation of them , as to leave the reader in doubt , as to which side his own opinion leans ; so that the charge of having committed errors , which the reader now first hears insinuated , remains , and leaves , on the whole , an unfavorable impression . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten , to pass under a heavy fire to the Niagara , in order to make a last chivalrous effort to retrieve the day , by taking her into the thickest of the fight , to the station which he had originally assigned to her , and from which she had so sedulously kept aloof , is disparaged , in an elaborate note , in which we are told , that " Captain Elliott was much longer in the same boat , and passed nearly through the whole line twice . " It is not mentioned , that Captain Perry passed from under the guns of the enemy , when the Lawrence lay a wreck , exposed to a deadly fire , directed at him , to the Niagara , for the purpose of returning instantly with her , into the midst of the enemy 's squadron , while Captain Elliott , on the contrary , passed from the Niagara , still so far beyond the reach of danger , as yet to bave bad only two men wounded , to that portion of the squadron which was yet more remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much evidence of an intention to disparage Commodore Perry , for the benefit of Captain Elliott , by saying ; " There was , no doubt , a personal risk , in all the boats , but there was personal risk everywhere , on such an occasion . * In evidence , that the personal risk was not everywhere the same in this action , we will quote some facts stated by Mr. Cooper , with regard to the casualties in the American squadron . Speaking of the unparalleled carnage on board the Lawrence , he says , " Of her crew , twenty-two were killed and sixty-one wounded , most of the latter severely . When Captain Perry left her , taking with him four of his people , there remained on board but fifteen sound men . The Niagara had two killed , and twentyfive wounded , or about one-fourth of all at quarters . " - Vol. ii . p. 397 . He subsequently says , " Although the Niagara suffered in a much less degree , // twenty-seven men killed and wounded , in a ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , under ordinary circumstances , would be thought a large proportion . " - Vol. ii . pp. 398 , 399 . Here , certainly , was considerable personal risk , though the killed of the Niagara , compared with that of the Lawrence , was only in the proportion of two to twenty-two . But , if the reader infers , and Mr. Cooper does not lead him to infer otherwise , that the killed and wounded of the Niagara were struck by the side of Captain Elliott , the inference would be most erroneous . We learn , from other sources than Mr. Cooper 's book , that two men were wounded on board the Niagara , up to the time of Captain Elliott 's leaving her , and two men were also wounded on board of the Somers , to which vessel Captain Elliott repaired , and we will suppose , that these two men were wounded after Captain Elliott took command of her . It follows , that of the total killed and wounded , of the squadron , amounting , in all , to twenty-seven killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eightysix wounded at the side of Commodore Perry , while four were wounded at the side of Captain Elliott . Though Mr. Cooper says , " there was personal risk everywhere , " he will scarcely deny , that here the degree was very different , being as four to one hundred and ten . The moral of Mr. Cooper 's account of the battle of Lake Erie , seems to be summed up in the following words ; " For his conduct , in this battle , Captain Perry received a gold medal from Congress . Captain Elliott also received a gold medal . " Throughout the account of this battle , there seems to us , for the reasons we have enumerated , to he an effort to disparage the brilliancy of the victory generally , and to detract from the glory of the hero who won it , by an attempt to raise the name of Captain Elliott to the same unsullied eminence with that of his chief . We are told , that " Captain Perry , in his Report of the action , eulogized the conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not told , that Captain Perry subsequently recalled this eulogy in the most solemn manner , explaining , in a letter to the Secretary of the Navy ( bringing charges against Captain Elliott ) the noble and generous motives , which led him into error . " After the battle was won , ( he says , ) I felt no disposition rigidly to examine into the conduct of any of the officers of the // fleet ; and , strange as the behaviour of Captain Elliott had been , yet I would not allow myself to come to a decided opinion , that an officer , who had so handsomely conducted himself on a former occasion , as I then , in common with the public , had been led to suppose Captain Elliott had , could possibly be guilty of cowardice or treachery . The subsequent conduct , also , of Captain Elliott ; the readiness with which he undertook the most minute services ; the unfortunate situation in which he now stood , which he lamented to me , and his marked endenyours to conciliate protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , still more than all , I was actuated by a strong desire , that in the fleet I then had the honor to command , there should be nothing but harmony after the victory they had gained , and that nothing should transpire , which would bring reproach upon any part of it , or convert into crimination the praises to which they were entitled , and which I wished them all to share and enjoy . " These , Sir , are the reasons , which induced me , at the time , not to bring on an inquiry into his conduct . The cause and propriety of my now doing so , will , I trust , require but few explanations . I would willingly , for my own sake , as well as his , after the course I had pursued , for the purpose of shielding him , have still remained silent ; but this Captain Elliott will not allow me to do . lie has acted upon the idea , that by assailing my character he shall repair his own . " After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was soon informed of the intrigues he was there practising , some of which are detailed in these charges . These I should not have regarded , as long as they were private ; but I then determined and declared , to many of my friends in the navy , that , should Captain Elliott ever give publicity to his misrepresentations , I would then demand an investigation of the whole of his conduct . this necessity is now forced upon me . " From the affidavits of evidence , accompanying the charges against Captain Elliott , forwarded by Commodore Perry to the Secretary of the Navy , and from other affidavits , subsequently furnished by other officers of the squadron on Lake Erie , the signers of which occupied important stations during the fight , and have ever been held among the most honorable and high-minded officers in the navy , it would have been an easy task for us to have shown the manner in which the battle of Lake Erie was won by Commodore Perry , and jeoparded by Captain Elliott , and to have assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dishonor . Finding , however , in the work of Mr. Cooper itself , the means of // arriving at the truth , by an analysis of the facts , so as to remove the unjust impression , which the statements and commentaries together are suited to convey , we have preferred to avail ourselves of the materials which lie has himself afforded , to vindicate the claims of a departed hero to the gratitude of his country , and the uses of history from unjust perversion , to serve the temporary interests of persons or parties . Apart from the serious objections , which we have been reluctantly compelled to urge against Mr. Cooper 's book , with regard to his unfair account of the battle of Lake Erie , we have little to say against the tone and spirit of its execution . We might , l ) erhaps , also except the efforts which he makes to vindicate the conduct of some officers , who have been the occasion of dishonor to the country ; a vindication which is the more offensive , because it is contrasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the proudest national recollections . His style , though incorrect and inelegant , is strong ; and , for the sake of its strength and energy , we can excuse the want of polish , the frequent recurrence of favorite ideas , such as " facts invariaaby preceding opinion , in a country as purely practical as this , " and the constant and awkward use of sea-phrases , often unintelligible to the ordinary reader , even when properly applied . With these exceptions , the work has the merit of liberality , talent , and ingenuity . The narratives of battles are almost always nervous and striking , and the criticisms , which accompany them , generally just and discriminating . The Introduction of the work is a highly sensible and important paper , in which Mr. Cooper has stated the result of his reflections on the condition and wants of the navy . His ideas are just in themselves , and valuable , as the fruit of such long study of a favorite theme . We should be glad to make room here for the whole of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " While those who have reflected , have clearly foreseen , that the republic must assert its place in the scale of iiations , defend its territory , and maintain its rights , principally by means of a powerful marine , all are compelled to acknowledge , that the growth of this branch of the public service has been slow , uncertain , and marked by a policy as timid as it has been fluctuating . " " It has long been confessed , that America possessed every // qualification for the creation of a powerful navy , but men and money . The necessary skill , the required aptitude for sea service , and the other requisites , have always been admitted ; but it has been asserted , that neither the finances , nor the population , would allow of the draw on their resources , that is unavoidably connected with a strong marine . The two deficiencies , if they actually existed , would certainly be fatal . " In the years 1812 , 1813 , and 1814 , the republic expended considerably more than $ 50,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sums , that were subsequently paid , on the same account . This war lasted but two years and eight months , and , during the first season , its operations were very limited . $30,000,000 more were paid , on account of military charges , in the two years of peace that immediately succeeded , making a total of $ 80,000,000 . It is known , that even this large sum falls materially short of the truth . During the same five years , the money expended on the navy amounted to only $30,000,000 , although the peculiar nature of the service on the Lakes involved an enormous and an unusual expenditure ; and a war with Algiers occurred , during which the country maintained , afloat , a much larger force than it had ever previously employed . In addition , the greater part of this expenditure was the cost of new constructions . It follows , that America expended nearly two dollars on her army , and its military operations , in the war of 1812 , for every dollar expended on her navy , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . Had the fact been precisely reversed , it is probable , that the proportions required by good policy would have been better observed , and there can be but little doubt , that the country would have reaped the advantage ; for no serious invasion of America will ever be attempted , in the face of a strong fleet , after the country shall be provided with docks and arsenals , by means of which , accidental reverses can be remedied . By dividing the large sum expended on the army and navy , between the years 1812 and 1816 , inclusively , $ 40,000,000 would have fallen to the share of each branch of the service , which would have given $ 8,000,000 a year to the navy . This sum would be amply sufficient , to maintain a force of twenty sail of the line , with a suitable number of small vessels , to cruise in company . Against such a fleet , no European power could have attempted an invasion of a coast , so distant from its own resources . " " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy the ships they took , because the enemy was known so closely to infest the coast , that it was impossible to get a prize in , whereas a strong force would put an end to all sorts of blockades. " // " But the probationary period of the American marine is passing away , and the body of the people are beginning to look forward to the appearance of their fleets on the ocean . It is no longer thought , there is an unfitness in the republic 's possessing heavy ships ; and the opinion of the country , in this , as in other respects , is slowly rising to the level of its wants . Still , many lingering prejudices remain in the public mind , in connexion with this all-important subject , and some that threaten the service with serious injury . Of these , the most prominent are , the mode in which the active vessels are employed ; a neglect of the means of creating seamen for the public service the fact , that there is no force in commission on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-respect , as the aim of military men ; and the impairing of discipline , and lessening the deference for the justice of the state , by the denial of rank . " " It will be clear to the dullest mind , that the evolutions of a fleet , and , in a greater or less degree , its success , must be dependent on the qualities of its poorest vessels , since its best can not abandon their less fortunate consorts to the enemy . The naval history of the world abounds with instances , in which the efforts of the first sea-captains , of their respective ages , have been frustrated by the defects of a portion of the ships under their command . To keep a number of vessels in compact order , to cause them to preserve their weatherly position , in gales and adverse winds , and to bring them all , as near as possible , up to the standard that shall be formed by the most judicious and careful commander , is one of the highest aims of naval experience . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutions , more frequently than on any dexterity in fighting guns . An efficient fleet can no more be formed without practice in squadrons , than an efficient army without evolutions in brigades . By not keeping ships in squadrons , there will also be less emulation , and consequently less improvement . " " By putting in commission six or eight two-decked ships , and by causing them to appear , from time to time , on all the more important stations , on this side of the two great southern capes , the country , at no material additional cost , would obtain the several objects of practice in fleets , of comparative trials of the qualities of the most important class of vessels in the navy , of a higher state of discipline , and of a vast improvement in the habits of subordination , on the part of commanders , a defect , that all experience shows , is peculiar to the desultory mode of service now in use , and which has produced more naval disasters in the world , than probably any other cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy can no more be obtained , by the services of single ships , than wars can be decided by armies , cut up into battalions . Small vessels are as indispensable , for lower schools of practice , as company drills in an army ; but squadrons alone can produce the highest class of officers , the steadiest discipline , or the desired objects . Jn addition to this neglect of accustoming the service to the use of the particular sort of force , necessary to render a marine effective for great ends , the history of the world can not , probably , supply a parallel to that forgetfulness , which the American government has manifested , of all the known incentives of human exertions , in the management of the navy . " " Next to personal reputation , military rank is the highest stirriulus of a military life . Its possession enters into all the daydreams of the young aspirant for fame and honors , is inseparable from self-respect , and is indissolubly connected with discipline . " " For many years , all the promotions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , with full experience of the evils of a system of incentives so meagre , and of a concentration of rank so destructive of self-respect and discipline , the life of the American naval officer is cheered by only four promotions , two of which are little more than the chances that nature herself demands , by transferring the officer from the duty of a boy , to duty more becoming a man . " It is not easy , fully to impress on the minds of civilians the immense results , that are dependent on a due division of military rank . The commission , which represents the power of the state , in a short time gets to be the substitute of personal qualities , and produces that prompt and nearly passive obedience , which are indispensable to the success of military movements . " " The rank of a captain in the navy never can be a sufficient inducement to attract the highest talents , in a country in which every species of preferment is open to competition . Hope has hitherto kept the service together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future . To pretend , however , to manage *eets , with officers of the same rank as the commanders of single vessels , infers as great an absurdity , as to pretend to manage ships with no other rank than that of a midshipman . There is , indeed , a greater connexion between rank and discipline as applied to fleets , than between rank and discipline as applied to ships . " " The necessity of creating higher rank in the navy , on account of its influence on other services , more especially when acting in conceit with American fleets , has often been pointed out . The answer to this practical argument , has usually been // a high pretension , in behalf of the republic , to act agreeably to its own policy , and a right to insist , that any notion of superiority , that it may choose to attach to the station of a captain , in its own navy , shall be recognised by the agents of other governments . This extravagant idea can be supported by neither usage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all international questions should be settled by the general consent of states , and not by the peculiar policy of any particular community . As well might America pretend to say , its charg*s d ' *ffaires shall have the rank of ambassadors at foreign courts , as to say , that its captains , under any circumstances , shall have the rank of admirals on foreign stations . " " The usages of nations must control this interest , as well as all others , that equally affect different states ; and as there is nothing new , or peculiar , in captains occasionally commanding squadrons , umnder the temporary title of commodores , among all the naval powers of Christendom , other people may object to America* s attaching a new importance to an old commission . " " Admirals are as necessary to fleets , as captains to ships . The thing must exist , under some appellation or other ; and , if the old term brings with it additional dignity , respect , authority , and adds fresh incentives to exertions , it is utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in calling the commander of a fleet a captain , or even a commodore , than in styling the first magistrate of the republic a justice of the peace . " - Vol. i. pp. xiii . - xxxi . A fact has just occurred , within our own waters , to illustrate the soundness of these remarks . We read , in the journals of the day , that the French Admiral Baud in , in command of the West India station , made a visit to Pensacola , while Commodore Shubrick , commanding our naval forces in the West Indies , was lying in the harbour . Owing to his inability to exchange courtesies , on equal terms , with an officer inferior to him in rank , in a foreign service , the French Admiral left the port prematurely . Yet both these officers were commanders-in-chief , and the American* probably , had under his orders the heaviest force . The difficulty consisted in the disparity of rank , the one being a duly commissioned admiral , the other only a post-captain , with the brevet rank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all other navies . We hope , for the sake of the discipline of the navy , and the attitude which our national pride would wish it to assume towards all foreign navies , both in peace and war , that the rank of admiral may be speedily established in it . // Another measure , of scarcely inferior importance to the creation of the rank of admiral , we consider to be the establishment of a naval academy for the education of midshipmen . If it were necessary to prove , that a preparatory school for the education of young officers for the navy is as important as the corresponding establishment , now existing , for the education of officers for the army , at West Point , we might show , that the naval profession is not less distinct from ordinary pursuits than the military , and , therefore , no less requires a specially adapted education . If , then , a preparatory education is as necessary to qualify a youth to become distinguished in the navy as in the army , it can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are quite as essential to the safety and honor of the country . In time of war , the navy is to fight our battles at a distance from our shores ; surely our officers should not merely be brave , but skilled in all the arts that decide the fate of battles ; versed not merely in all that theory can suggest , but acquainted with every expedient , that has ever been resorted to , by the naval heroes of every age . In seasons of l ) eace , our friendly relations with other powers are in no slight degree intrusted to the keeping of our naval commanders ; for it is on the common highway of the ocean , that our interests and honor are most often brought into collision with those of other powers . At all times , our ships of war are the representatives of our country , in every quarter of the globe ; it is chiefly by the worth , intelligence , and courtesy of their officers , that an estimate can he formed of the nation that sends them forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unchanged since we first expressed them , ten years ago , in this Journal , * are , that it should he established in some healthy , isolated situation , with the sea in sight , affording constant opportunities of heholding the manmnvres of ships . The age of admission might be thirteen years , and the term of service either three or four years . The system of discipline should be rigid , yet paternal . Mathematics would , of course , form the groundwork of the pupils ' education ; but its study should not be pursued beyond the point necessary to render the various prohlerns of nautical astronomy intelligihle . Upon this would he raised the superstructure of natural philosophy , astronomy , navigation , surveying , the principles of naval architecture , // and the theory of working ships . To these studies should he added a knowledge of history , of the laws of nations , and of the rules of composition . I ' he French and Spanish languages , and drawing , should also he taught . rrhe exercises should consist in fencino* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man*uvies of a small ship , of one or two hundred tons , moored near the academy . Rigging and stripping ship , exercising guns , reefing , furling , steering , and heaving the lead ; every operation , in short , should be performed hy the lads themselves . Each class should have its proper station ; the junior class , on deck the next would know enou 6h to he top-men ; and so on , with the stations of petty officers ; the senior class would do the duty of officers , and he stationed ahout , to direct and aid the efforts of the crew ; while in rotation one of the number would he invested with the command . One day in each week should he employed in a cruise round the harhour while , in summer , the ordinary season of vacation might he passed in an extended cruise along the coast . Every thing done , on hoard of such a vessel , would be done in the best manner ; the youths would have before them an epitome of their future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of its details . If this system were introduced , it would furnish an invaluahle groundwork of professional education to our officers . The first examination for admission would reject many applicants , and the subsequent years of prohation would clear off all the stupid , vicious , and insuhordinate . Those who should pass the ordeal creditahly , and enter the navy as midshipmen , would he of the greatest use hy their own services , no less than hy stimulating the efforts of their superiors . With such an institution , we might dispense entirely with the schools existing at the several naval stations , and also with the present worthless and utterly ahortive system of schools on hoard ship , where , in many cases , the schoolmaster is the occasion of stimulating little other ingenuity , than that of playing tricks , at his own expense , which tricks , however suhversive of discipline , are sometimes encouraged hy the contemptuous and disparaging treatmnent pursued hy commanders towards this class of officers . If it he of importance to take measures for the education of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it // to endeavour to establish a settled system for the manning of our fleets . We think , that a basis for such a system might be found in the law of Congress for the enlistment of apprentices into the navy . Even to the extent to which this system has been carried , it has been productive of good , by introducing a class of recruits into the navy very superior to any that have hitherto been entered . As yet , however , only five hundred apprentices have been entered since the law ) assed , nearly three years ago . At this rate , though the character of our seamen , petty officers , and warrant officers , may , in a course of years , be considerably improved , by the introduction into the service of a portion of bettertrained materials of native stock , but little will be effected towards the great object of manning the navy with a class of native seamen , specially trained for it . We believe , however , that the apprentice system , properly expanded and judiciously carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present , the boys , of the character and propensities which lead them to go to sea , and make their parents willing that they should do so , are only taken from the four large cities where there are recruiting stations . Stations should be established at more numerous points , but on a smaller and less expensive scale , for entering apprentices for the navy ; and advertisements should be published , far and wide in the country , setting forth the terms on which the government would receive them , and the obligations by which it would bind itself to furnish them with education , and a profession by which they could always 5u ) Ort themselves comfortably , and rise in the navy , or merchant service , according to their degree of merit and ambition . In this way , a drag net might be thrown over the whole country , and probably two thousand boys , between thirteen and seventeen years of age , might be annually procured . As they improved , and distinguished themselves for good conduct , they should be advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closing years of their apprenticeship , they would , many of them , be qualified to become petty officers . Graduated apprentices should have the preference for the stations of petty officers ; and , as they advanced in experience and ability , the stations of boatswain and gunner should be likewise open to them . These stations are now often filled by foreigners , and , though the pay is handsome , are filled very badly . The // gunners of the service are particularly deficient , and unworthy of their station , though it is one of great responsibility and importance . Their annual pay , in a line-of-battle ship , amounts to near eight hundred dollars , and yet , perhaps , there are not three on the list thoroughly competent for their duty . There should he a school , for the education of gunners ' mates and gunners , on board of our steamers of war , which should also be used , each summer , as a school of practice for gunnery , as is now the case with the Fulton . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board the Excellent at Portsmouth in England , introduced into the Fulton forthwith , and into the other steamers as they are completed . In this way we might soon have gunners , who would be Americans , and know their duty . With regard to the naval apprentices , after a few months ' preparatory training in the receiving-ships , to each of which a small cruiser , for exercise , might he attached , they should be sent on distant cruises , with rigid orders to the commanders to carry out a prescribed system of education . To prevent desertion among the apprentices , after they have become sailors , they should be kept well ahead of the purser , with large balances due them . At the expiration of their terms of service , they might receive a discharge which would entitle them to receive their pay , as on leave of absence , if returning within two months ; and the same system might be pursued now towards petty officers and seamen , permitting them , at all times , to report tl1emselves on board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of their discharge , receiving their pay for the interval , and the same rank as in the last ship . By pursuing the apprentice system to its utmost limits , there is little doubt , that the navy would , within ten years , man itself entirely with native seamen , familiar with its ships and officers , and having all its interests warmly at heart . It would also serve to furnish skilful seamen to the merchant service , instead of being , as it now is , a drain upon it . In the mean time , and until the apprentice system can be made the means of completely manning the navy , we should he sorry to see our si ) ips continue in port , and our navy prevented from taking that extension , which the protection of commerce requires , by the want of seamen to fill up their complements . Let our ships , now waiting for crews , fill up // with any material they can get , so long as the number is complete , and sail . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main top-sail , they can he taken care of from the first , and , in a few months of skilful training , will be able to perform every evolution creditably . The Independence , which spreads nearly as much canvass as the Pennsylvania , sailed from Boston , in 1837 , with a crew of less than six hundred men , exclusive of officers . They were unusually young and light hands , and most of them entirely raw . Yet , from the moment of bending sails , there was no striking deficiency , and in a very few months the ship could enter into comparison , in the performance of evolutions , with the most practised cruisers . Any of the sloops , now waiting for crews , might perfectly well go to sea with three fourths of their crews composed of boys and landsmen . The difficulty of manning our ships , under the present system , would be much lessened , if the ships , returning from abroad , were to arrive in May and June , and those hound out to sail in July and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend their hard-earned pay in , and would soon be ready to take service in the departing ships . Our ships , too , would approach and leave our coast in fine weather . The extensive mortality , which always occurs when ships are fitted out in the winter , and the many deaths which take place in the course of the cruise , clearly attributable to the same cause , might thus be avoided . With regard to the character and construction of our ships , great necessity exists for the adoption of fixed principles , and settled models for every different class . The greatest difference of opinion exists , as to which are the best ships in the service , and most worthy to be adopted as models . The prevailing opinion is probably in favor of the Ohio , as a lineof-battle ship , the Constitution , United States , or President , as a frigate , the Vincennes , or John Adams , as a sloop , and the Spark , as a small vessel . It is highly desirable , on this account , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different class , together , to cruise , with a view to establish , beyond a doubt , which are superior . This object , and that of the general improvement of the navy , could be easily effected by carrying out the proposition of Mr. Cooper for the perpetual maintenance of a cruising squadron of six or eight lineof-battle ships , accompanied by a number of the best frigates // and smaller vessels . Such a squadron would , at the same time , form a school for the perfecting of every thing belonging to the service , by affording a degree of competition which has never yet existed , and display the power of the republic , in every sea , in a manner well suited to protect the interests of our commerce . Whenever any coast became the scene of war or blockades , our fleet should appear on it , for the double purpose of observation and instruction to the officers , and of furnishing to our merchants the best possible guaranty against spoliation . In order that this guaranty may be more effectually rendered , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall ever have one , but by our cruisers generally in every sea , we think that our commanders should be furnished with general instructions to regulate their conduct with regard to the protection of commerce , the respect to be paid to blockades , what blockades are valid and binding , and what are not ; also , with regard to affording refuge to political fugitives ; arid whether they should , under any circumstances , land a portion of their crew , for the protection of American citizens , in moments of revolutionary struggle . It seems to us very clear , that portions of the crews of our ships should riot be landed in cities , disturhed by insurrections , to protect the property of American citizens ; and yet this has occasionally been practised . The existence and efficiency of a man-of-war is thus jeoparded by the liability of a portion of her crew to be cut off , and with it her ability to perform her legitimate duty of receiving American citizens tinder the protection of the flag . Moreover , a commander , landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayed into a breach of neutrality . With regard to the reception of fugitives , it is true , that genuine patriots may , in seasons of domestic trouble , be compelled to fly for their lives ; but it is the duty of neutrals to respect the sovereignty of the port which offers them hospitality , arid the dominant party which holds sway there by the will of the majority . If , however , hospitality should be granted to those who , when in peril of life from revolutionary movements , seek the hospitality and protection of our flag , the boats of our ships should , at any rate , never invade the soyereigrity of a foreign state for the purpose of withdrawing crin*inals , or political delinquents , from its jurisdiction . The commander of a man-of-war loses his ability to protect his // own countrymen , and to fulfill his legitimate office of exerting his influence in their behalf , whenever he irritates the existing authorities of a country , by invading its sovereignty , and violating its independence . We hope , then , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see our naval commanders furnished with a brief and comprehensive code of international law , in the shape of concise orders , for the regulation of their conduct in all questions that are likely to occur to them in the prosecution of their responsible duties . These orders would distinctly instruct them , as to the control they would exercise over our merchantmen , the protection they should render them , when to allow them to be captured for a breach of virtual blockade , and when to stand to their guns in defence of them , when a blockade is illegal and ineffective . The conduct to be pursued , with regard to the demand of deserters from our service , and the delivery up of those from foreign services , should also be distinctly prescribed . We are of opinion , that deserters should never be delivered up , except by virtue of a reciprocal treaty stipulation . By means of orders , such as we have described , the information , scattered over many volumes of international law , would be placed within the reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages , prescribing the line of their conduct , in whatever circumstances of difficulty they might be placed . Thus , in the conduct of our external relations , through the medium of our ships , the combined wisdom of our ablest jurists would be substituted for the erring guidance of minds not accustomed to grapple with legal problems , and , at the very moment when they are called on to decide and act with vigor , too often crushed by the pressure of a responsibility so much more formidable to them than cannonhalls . It is true , that our commanders , when left to themselves , have generally acquitted themselves creditably of their important charge to protect the interests of commerce , and sustain the honor of our flag ; but it is also true , that they have occasionally made very pitiful exhibitions . We would wish to see these instructions , not merely issued to all our naval commanders , but published to the world , that foreign nations might not only be informed with regard to the settled policy of our country , on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seas , but also , // that we were ready , on all occasions , by force of arms , to defend it . So far from bringing us in collision with foreign nations , orders such as these , when published to the world , would be our sure guaranty from aggression . They would , moreover , be one step towards the triumph of justice throughout the world . To form a just estimate of what should constitute the disposable force of our own navy , it is necessary to take into consideration the disposable naval force of other powers . There are no fewer than five powers that maintain , at this time , a stronger force in commission than we do ; namely , England , France , Russia , Turkey , and Egypt . Were we suddenly to go to war with any one of the three former , we should necessarily be overpowered , blockaded , and driven temporarily from the ocean , in the first struggle . As , however , it is with England or France , that we are most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a brief view of the force and condition of their navies . By a statement , made by an intelligent officer of our service recently employed in examining the condition of the European navies , it appears , that , in September last , the British navy , including ships in process of construction , consisted of ninetyone line-of-hattie ships , one hundred frigates , twenty corvettes , twenty-three steam ships , and one hundred and seventy*six smaller vessels . Of these , twenty-three line-of-battle ships , ten frigates , eighteen corvettes , sixteen steam ships , and one hundred and fifty-one small vessels were actually in commission . The French navy consisted , at the same time , of forty-nine line-of-hattie ships , sixty frigates , forty-four corvettes , thirty-one steam ships , and forty-six small vessels . Of these , eleven line-of-battle ships , seventeen frigates , twentyfour corvettes , twenty steam ships , and thirty-six small vessels were in commission . Let us now examine what was , at the same time , the condition of our own navy . We had eleven line-of-battle ships , seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small vessels , and one store-ship . Of these , two line-of-battle ships , three frigates , thirteen sloops , one steam ship , ten small vessels , and the store-ship were in commission . The comparison of numbers , between our ships , as thus stated , and those of England and France , is absolutely ludicrous ; and yet our commerce , the protection of which is the most legitimate object of a navy , is // rapidly approaching to an equality with that of England , and is three times that of France . If the disparity of numbers is so much against us , in a comparison of our navy with that of England and France , we are not so sure as we would wish to be , that a comparison , in other respects , would be more favorable to us . In the order of their ships , whether for appearance or for service , in the efficiency of the batteries , the arrangement of the sights and locks , the condition of the small arms , and their convenient arrangement for use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in successful effort to attach the crews to the service , in every thing , in short , but the issue of ardent spirits and the infliction of the lash , we are not sure , that our navy would not suffer in a comparison with that of England . We fear , indeed , that the English navy , in its condition , bears somewhat the same relation to ours now , as ours did to it at the commencement of the late war . The acknowledgment is made reluctantly and with mortification , but with a view to reformation . With regard to the French navy , it is inferior to ours in the evolutions of single ships , and in seamanship generally ; but superior in the arrangement of the batteries , magazines , and small arms . Gunnery is more practised , and better understood , in the French navy than in ours . A familiarity , too , with the use of hollow shot , projected horizontally , gives them a great advantage over us . Shot of this description were first invented , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by R. L. Stevens , Esquire , and some were preparing to be put on board the President frigate , when she sailed and was brought to action by a squadron of British ships . These shots , having been found , by experiment , to be very destructive , were put , formerly , on board of our ships of war ; but , of late years , the practice has been discontinued . In the mean time , the French have introduced them into all their ships . Four heavy guns , for the discharge of hollow shot , are placed in each of their large ships , and two in the smaller vessels . These hollow shot were found very effective in the attack on the castle of San Juan de Ulloa . The English are also introducing them into all their newly-fitted ships . It is time that our officers , also , should become acquainted with the use of a highly destructive missile , originally invented among us . In full view of all these circumstances , we think , that , in // order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which we may hereafter be involved , our naval preparations should be on a footing , to enable us to put to sea , within five years , with a force of forty sail of the line , and an equal number of frigates . Half of this force should be ready to sail within a year , the rest of the ships should be on the stocks , or in frames , ready to be set up . Six line-of-battle ships might be kept in commission , as a fleet of observation , and school of practice . Six frigates , with twenty sloops , and a dozen brigs , would suffice , for the ordinary protection of commerce , throughout the world ; the fleet of line-of-battle ships being always ready to repair to a threatened point of hostilities or blockade . A home squadron , of half a dozen vessels , would be exceedingly useful , for the purpose of relieving vessels coming on our coast at inclement seasons , and , at all times , as a school of practice and a nursery for seamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revenue vessels , they being brought into the regular service . In England , where the temptati9n to smuggle is so much greater than here , the cruisers , which protect the revenue , form part of the regular service . There is no reason , why the same system should not answer here ; and at a time when it is desirable to find useful employment for our officers , such a field for it , as the preventive service would afford , should not be neglected . The officers of our navy , taking part in this service , in turn , would all obtain accurate local information of our coasts and harbours , which would be of the greatest value to them . The present officers of the revenue service could be introduced into the navy as masters , and masters ' mates , or placed upon pensioii . In times past , the revenue vessels have , occasionally , been commanded by naval officers , but not as belonging to the regular navy . If they have been guilty of misconduct , or failed to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their commands , without suffering at all as naval officers . If we were to adopt the preventive service , as it exists in England , in connexion with our home squadron , the system could not fail to work well , and the navy to derive great benefit from it . Instead of the present system , of attaching a ship permanently to one station for three years , great benefit would be derived from introducing a rotation of stations . The ships , // which go first to the Mediterranean , might leave it , on the approach of winter , during which they do not cruise in that sea , and proceed to Brazil , by the Canary Islands , and the coast of Africa ; after remaining a year on the coast of Brazil , they might return homewards by the West Indies , completing their term of service on that station . In like manner , the East India ships might return by the Pacific and Brazil , as the Columbia and John Adams , indeed , are about to do and the Pacific ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season should he favorable for passing Cape Horn , might circumnavigate the world in the contrary direction , returning by the East Indies and the Cape of Good Hope . Great advantage would result from this system , in the protection of commerce , as the field of cruising would he greatly extended , and our ships would he constantly appearing in remote quarters and unexpectedly . The object of professional improvement would he promoted , by our ships being almost constantly at sea , and the irksomeness of a long detention on a particular coast would be avoided . The flag ships might remain constantly on the same station , if it were deemed advisable . In addition to our present stations , the constant presence of a sloop , in the neighbourhood of our principal whaling station , for the time being , would be exceedingly useful to that valuable branch of commerce and nursery of seamen . In addition to our present classes of ships , we should find great advantage in having three or four frigates , to draw not more than nineteen feet , for flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this draft might be made to sail and perform well , and could enter the ports of the river La Plata with ease , as well as most of our southern harbours , and those of the Gulf of Mexico . Sloops of war will not answer the purpose , as they are not considered , abroad , sufficiently respectable to bear the flag of a commander-in-chief . If we are not to have admirals , and without them we can never have a respectable or well-disciplined navy , at any rate our commodores should never be permitted to go to sea without captains to command their ships . Commodores , without captains under them , scarcely ever merit the name . They are merely captains of particular ships , often making use of their superiority only to render the other ships of the squadron subservient to their own , instead of feeling an equal // interest in all . Moreover , from the advanced age at which they usually reach this station , they are unsuited to handle their ships in a skilful and dashing manner . The mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleets , as admirals , are not so applicable to the active command of single ships , which requires promptness and excitability . We are of opinion , that , in addition to captains in all flag ships , it would be highly conducive to discipline , if the executive duty , now assigned to the first lieutenant , were performed by commanders in all our line-of-battle ships and frigates . No vessel , however small , which is sent on a foreign station , should be commanded by a lower class of officers , than that of commander ; and vessels commanded by lieutenants , on the home station , should have passed midshipmen to keep the watches . Among the existing evils of the service , is the frequent change of officers in our ships . In no case should an officer be transferred from the ship in which he originally sailed , unless his health should be so much impaired , as , in the case of a seaman , would lead to his being sent home as an invalid . Nothing occasions so much discouragement among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving them , either to go home , or to pass to another ship . The evil of a change of commanders is of course much greater , and should , if possible , never be incurred . Another evil , of greater magnitude , is keeping a crew out beyond the term of their enlistment . Besides disgusting seamen with the service , and discouraging their return to it , it often leads to acts of insubordination at the termination of the cruise , which are deplorable in themselves and fatal in their example . Nor is this evil much abated , where men on foreign stations , towards the end of the term of their service , when they should be on their way home to be discharged , are cajoled to re*inter until the return of the ship to the United States . In the first place , a favor is to be asked of those , who , while on board of our ships , should be required only to obey . In the second place , the choice is not honestly offered them . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times should be out ; but the bribery of a week 's liberty and two or three months ' pay , after years of close and almost uninterrupted confinement , is more than they can resist . A dishonest bargain is made with them , and on // their arrival in the United States , they burst the bonds of discipline , and enact scenes disgraceful to the service , and permanently prejudicial to its character . Three years are quite long enough for our officers and seamen to be absent from their country , and we should be glad to see our ships return much within that time . In concluding these remarks , which a strong interest in the subject has led us to extend far beyond our intention , we would express the fervent hope , that our navy may , ere long , receive the extension and improvement , which the best interests of the country demand.
