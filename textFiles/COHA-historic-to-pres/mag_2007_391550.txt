EATING RIGHT Seattle 's Theo is a Fair Trade Version of Willy Wonka 's Chocolate Factory " Sweet dreams are made of this ... " It was pure coincidence that the 1983 Eurythmies hit was playing on the radio as the staff of Theo Chocolate readied the next 6,000-pound load of cocoa beans . Theo , based since March 2006 in the hip Seattle neighborhood of Fremont , is the first roaster of organic and fair trade-certified cocoa in the U.S. , and the owners have found that making chocolate is an exact science without many established guidelines . Debra Music , vice president and half of the husband-and-wife team ( along with CEO Joe Whinney ) at Theo 's helm , leads tours that include a stop at a pin-dotted world map . " We wanted to make a difference all along the supply chain , because cocoa is such an important global crop , " she says . Pins are clustered in the African continent , because some 60 percent of the world 's cocoa comes from West Africa . Theo sources its organic beans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dominican Republic . Cocoa is an equatorial crop and , in the U.S. , only grows in Hawaii . In the Ivory Coast , where 43 percent of the world 's cocoa originates , underage farm workers are regularly abused . The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture has documented some 284,000 children aged nine to 12 working in hazardous conditions on West African cocoa farms . Major chocolate producers , including Hershey 's and M &M/Mars,; have committed themselves to protecting child workers , but have been slow to take action . Fair Trade requires producers to pay living wages that allow workers to get their kids out of the fields and into school . And organic production helps protect tropical forests , because the untreated beans are grown ( like organic coffee ) in the shade of large trees . But Theo is not only politically correct , it 's also a gourmet roaster , trying to import the concept of " terroir " from the wine industry . Theo 's three-ounce dark chocolate bars are labeled with their country of origin , because , as with wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cocoa tree . The bars also list how much pure cocoa they contain , ranging from 65 percent in the Madagascar bar to a rich 91 percent in the Venezuela-sourced product . These bars , mixed with organic sugar from Swedish sugar beets , are milk-free and vegan , listing for $6 . The two-ounce 3400 Phinney milk chocolate products ( a more affordable $3.25 ) are available in exotic flavors such as vanilla , chai and coconut curry . Dark chocolate variations include coffee and nib brittle . You can order Theo online but soon you wo n't have to because Whole Foods is slated to carry the company 's line . The Laid-Back Line Whinney emphasizes that his operation is a chocolate " maker , " not a " melter . " The whole production process , from roughly sorted beans to packaged chocolate , takes place under one roof , in a former brewery . Comparisons to Willy Wonka 's chocolate factory are apt , because the whole process uses vintage equipment , much of it sourced from the famous chocolatiers of Europe . The beans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cleaning room that removes everything from pebbles to gum wrappers . The roaster , which operates at 240 degrees Fahrenheit and also cools the beans , is a German model from the 1930s . The roasted beans are hulled and then mashed by two huge grinding stones . Ball bearings help reduce the particle size . The process creates a thick , cocoabutter rich brew called " chocolate liquor " that is carried by a conveyor belt into a storage tank called a conche ( making chocolate this way is actually called " conching " ) . Sugar is added and mixed with the liquor after it is refined through giant rollers . In the molding room , the hot chocolate flows into white plastic forms that turn it into bars . Theo employs a young chocolatier , former pastry chef Autumn Martin , to dream up confectioner 's delights that are sold regionally and in the retail shop . Because no artificial preservatives or emulsifiers ( such as soy lecithin ) are used , Theo 's confection chocolates have a two-to-three-week shelf life . There are other fair trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dagoba and Endangered Species Chocolate . But Theo 's aroma-filled factory adds another dimension
