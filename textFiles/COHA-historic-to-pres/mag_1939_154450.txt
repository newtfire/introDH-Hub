Idaho 's Clark <P> Sirs : <P> TIME is not " Curt , Clear , Complete " when it uses the word " pretty " in describing Senator D. Worth Clark , the junior Senator from Idaho . There is nothing in the reference to Senator Clark in your March 13 issue that called for any such adjective . . . . <P> A pretty woman is one thing , a pretty man is the opposite . . . . <P> I 've known Senator Clark for nearly 20 years and lived with him a year at Notre Dame . I still regard him as having the best mind , memory and fund of general knowledge of anyone I 've ever known . He turned down a chance to take the exams for a Rhodes Scholarship in order to go to Harvard Law School . He was a much better scholar than the man who won . . . . <P> FRANCIS NEITZEL Boise , Idaho <P> &gt; Let readers judge the features of Idaho 's junior Senator for themselves ( see cut ) . TIME disparages neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco <P> Sirs : <P> . . . In studying the map of San Francisco which accompanied your article ( TIME , Feb. 27 ) , I was shocked to note the district bounded by Larkin , Mason , Turk and Ellis Streets described as the " toughest part of town , " and I am roused to protest . . . . The word " tough " conjures gangsters and gunmen-a district where decent citizens would hesitate to find themselves after dark and where unescorted women would be unsafe . <P> No one knows better than I that this impression of that particular district is entirely in error and I can say in all truth that there is no district in San Francisco which can be described as being " tough . " The San Francisco Police Department has worked hard and takes great pride in the fact that ours is one of the most crimeless cities among metropolitan cities of the world . We have never had racketeers or gangsters here ; we have not had a kidnaping for ransom since the turn of the century ; sex crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of comparable size in the U. S. ; bunco-men and pickpockets fight shy of San Francisco ; robberies and burglaries are constantly decreasing ; in short , no less an authority than Director J. Edgar Hoover has described San Francisco as the " white spot of the nation , " so far as crime is concerned . . . . <P> Since the opening of the Golden Gate International Exposition there has been . . . a noticeable absence of the type of crimes one might reasonably expect . This record can be attributed only to police vigilance and efficiency , plus the fact that San Francisco has no district where abound people who can be described as " tough " and who would protect law-violators in their operations . . . . <P> WM . J. QUINN Chief of Police San Francisco , Calif . <P> Sirs : <P> Perhaps you are right in considering the area bounded by Larkin , Ellis , Mason and Turk Streets as the " toughest " section of San Francisco . Some might consider North Beach or the South of Market area bounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tougher , but , as a professional social worker who has carried a case load in both areas , I do not think so .
