Singly , then like leaves in a gusty rustle of thousands , the letters came down . Some indignant , some pleading-all asking repeal of a once-minor piece of legislation : the law covering the renegotiation of war contracts . Last week the crackling corporate stationery and the yellow telegrams-2.000 in two days-fell on the Senate Finance Committee . Said Chairman Walter F. George : " As the law now operates it is definitely slowing up production . " <P> Slapped through last April to quench public indignation at the scandalous profits in the Jack &; Heintz case ( TIME , April 6 ) and others , the present law provides that on all war contracts in excess of $100,000 the Army , Navy and Maritime Commission may investigate manufacturers ' costs and scale down excessive profits . <P> Simple as this sounds it is full of jokers . There is no definition of " excessive " profits . The services can march in at any time to examine the books . They can come as often as they like , taking up any amount of company executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called for any time until three years after war 's end , which means that no company can be sure of its profits ( or losses ) until that date . And a company not sure of its profits can not satisfy bankers of its ability to repay loans needed to get the work done . <P> When the directors of Big Steel journeyed to Chicago for a meeting ( their first outside New York ) last week , Chairman Irving S. Olds pointed to the renegotiation law , remarked wryly : " We are in the peculiar position of doing the greatest business in our history and selling our goods without knowing the price we are getting . . . . Any quarterly or six-month financial report of a large corporation engaged in war production is nothing more than a forecast . " <P> The little law struck other big sparks . Ernest R. Breech , president of Bendix Aviation said , " It is the greatest deterrent to increased war production that could possibly be thought of . " President Roger D. Edward of Atlas Tack dolefully wired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management personnel in industry are just about ready to throw up the sponge and join the Army as buck privates . " Appointed last week , a Senate subcommittee is working out an answer to the problem of giving business some end to uncertainty , some limit to the number of times a renegotiation board can reopen a contract .
