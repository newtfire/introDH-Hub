He did n't take drugs , would n't take drugs , never took drugs . Never , never .... " // After both deaths , nearly the same second response came from people who never knew either man , medical examiners a continent apart : " Cocaine poisoning , cocaine in a lethal dose .... " // And after both deaths , the next response that came from just about everybody else was also the same  --  shock , anger , grief , a sense of resignation .
