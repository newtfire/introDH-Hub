else 's blood and someone else 's treasure , and the Transcript is ready to fight this war of civilization from the side-lines . It talks as Frenchmen whose country is invaded have a right to talk , and it talks as the Belgians who have paid the price have every justification for talking . And what does it propose to do ? To crush German militarism with British and French lives , contribute a little money to the Red Cross , send a few ambulance units to the Allied fronts , and publish articles about the wickedness of the Germans . The ignominy of it is fathomless . And anyone who does not imitate the Transcript is pro-German . Now we happen to have a different conception of America 's duty in this war , a concep ? tion which seems to us more useful and more honor ? able . The American people do not intend to take part in this war . They had no share in the diplo ? macy which led up to it , and their long habit of isola ? tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues involved . They might have been dragged in over the Lusitania , but it would have been a coup de force , not by a democratic decision . Since we do not intend to become a belligerent , we ought to have the decency not to talk and think like a belligerent . With a whole world at war there are plenty of other activities open to a powerful neutral . There is first of all the relief of suffering ? in which we have done miserably little . Our per capita contribution to Belgium , for example , is a great deal less than that of Australia . But more im ? portant than that is the task of keeping alive in the world the light of reason . We should be at the mo ? ment a clearing-house of fact and opinion , a trustee of all the sanctions which bind men together . It is not for us to egg Europe on to hate and more hate . It is for us to he insisting at all times that whatever wrong the Germans have done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the use ? lessness of hate , against the insanity which pro ? poses to atone for a crime by committing more crimes . Then we should be in a position to serve Europe . Then we should he able to contribute to the terms of peace . It is for us to hold fast the idea that the principle of the settlement must not be Punishment but the firm organization of Europe . Just because it is hard to forgive the Germans , we as neutrals ought to be insisting on it . It is not that Germany does n't deserve moral condemnation . It is that too great things are at stake for any such trivial attitude . Our hearts and minds must he set on the future , and that future is desperate unless there is everywhere a willingness to forget and a readiness to make adjustments . It is a difficult attitude to hold , Perhaps an impossible one for a people at war . But the moment we decided not to spend our lives on the battlefields of Europe it became the only course which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been sharply criti- cized for an article in its last issue entitled " War at Any Price , " in which it was urged that the facts of the military situation had come to make the terms of a possible treaty of peace a remunerative subject of discussion . We have been accused of play ? ing Germany 's game . The strategy of the German general staff , it is said , has become almost exclusively political . The German army is being used not as in the beginning , for the purpose of breaking down the armed resistance of its enemies , but for the acquisi ? tion of territory to be used in bargaining for peace . By negotiating in the Balkans with a force of 300 , ? 000 men instead of with diplomatic agents , the Germans have gained a political advantage over their enemies far more important than the military success . They have become , for the time being , the dominant power in the Balkans , and if this position can be secured to them in the treaty of peace they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to gain by bringing on the war . Having accomplished their political object , they naturally wish to stop a war from which they can gain no further substantial benefits ; and to this end they are appealing to the strong sentiment in favor of peace among the neutral nations . No opponent of German aggression should connive at the successful use of these tactics . Their political victory has not changed the underlying facts of the military situa ? tion . They have over-extended their military lines in the effort to secure a political advantage , and it only remains for the Allies to seize the opportunity offered by this subordination of military to political strategy . This they can certainly accomplish by continuing the campaign throughout another sum ? mer . Until the armies of the Allies have proved that the military position of the Germans is far weaker than their political position , the friends of the Allies should neither talk nor think of negotiations for peace . The foregoing criticism evades the real edge of our contention . We do not argue that the Allies should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation by the Germans of Allied territory . We only argue for the recognition of one all-important truth ? the truth that the treaty of peace , whenever and however it comes , will be the result of inconclusive military operations , and must be wrought by a process of bargaining and mutual adjustment . To insist upon the discussion of the terms of a possible treaty does not mean that the discussion is expected to produce an immediately successful result . Probably no statement of terms could be obtained from Germany under present conditions sufficiently favorable to become the basis of a tentative conference . For the time being any discussion of a treaty of peace in the Allied countries must still be subordinated to the necessity of a staunch and relentless prosecution of the war . But admitting the improbability of an early agreement , and not only admitting but insisting on the virtue of continuing to fight rather than of permitting Ger ? many to get away with her booty , the time has none the less come for candid discussion of a satisfactory basis of peace negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the war began , the Allies need to consult the Germans as to the best way of running their business . When the Germans brought on the war they expected to win a decisive victory and to be in a position within a year to impose their own terms , at least upon France and Russia . They have failed , and ever since Russia refused last summer to accept a sepa ? rate treaty they have realized their failure . Hence their strategy has become political rather than mili ? tary . They are fighting at the present time not with the expectation of dictating terms of peace , but with that of making the best possible bargain with their adversaries . The lesson that the Germans have learned the Allies must also learn . Although the Al ? lies will in the future have the advantage possessed in the past by the Germans of a preponderance of munitions and men , the task of crushing their enemies will be beyond their power as it was beyond Germany 's . They can improve their military posi ? tion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodshed which will disintegrate the very fibre of their national lives . They must continue to fight , but must not neglect to count the cost . They must follow Germany 's example and subordinate military operations to practicable political purposes . But just as soon as their strategy is determined by poli ? tical rather than exclusively military purposes , the treaty of peace which may result from their partial or complete success becomes a reasonable and a profitable subject of discussion . Unless we are much mistaken , the military policy of the Allies is already being determined by the in ? tention of occupying territory to be used in the negotiations for peace , rather than by the expecta ? tion of breaking down the armed resistance of their opponents . Can any other meaning be attached to the news that they have decided to dispatch a large army to the Balkans ? After the Russian defeats of last summer the only region in which a decisive victory can be won is the western front ; and the only effective method of winning on that front is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Great Britain on the stupendous task of wearing down German resistance . If they have decided to send a large army to the Balkans , where they fight under enormous disadvantages as com ? pared with northern France , only one inference is possible . It is an acknowledgment that after the disappointments of last September they no longer expect to do more than exercise a more or less severe pressure on the German army in the west . Once again they have been obliged to accept the German initiative and allow their adversaries to dictate the grand strategy of the war . They will certainly attempt to push the Germans back in northern France , and they may meet with some measure of success ; but the dominant issue which is now being fought out is whether Russian or German influence shall predominate in the Balkans , and the immediate prize is the accession to the Allied cause of Greece and Rumania . Thus the strategy of the Allies is actually beginning to be determined not by the ex ? pectation of breaking down German resistance but by specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself a preliminary discussion to a treaty of peace . Those who insist that the belligerent govern ? ments declare specifically what they expect to gain by continuing the war are thus supported by the logic of the military situation . The strategy of both groups of belligerents is no longer adapted to the object of subjugating their enemies . The Germans have revealed their consciousness of the change by ceasing to pretend that their army is the advance agent of a beneficent German Kultur . But Englishmen and Frenchmen still talk as if they represented a form of civilization which could be promoted by the opportunity of imposing their own terms on Germany . They are deceiving themselves . The best that an army can do for civilization is to defend it . German militarism has been a danger to Europe because German civilians permitted the political policy of the country to be determined by the amount and the efficiency of its armaments . They allowed the ruling class to seek the conversion of military efficiency into political supremacy . This was a baleful ambition , made palatable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations would be improved by having a dose of German civilization forced down their throats . Influential Frenchmen and Englishmen are now in serious danger of repeating Germany 's error , of playing Germany 's game , not for her but after her . In so far as they insist on continuing the war at any price they are allowing their policy to be controlled by the supposed supremacy of their armaments . They are proposing to crush Germany chiefly be ? cause , as they believe , they have the power to do so , and they are wrapping up an ambition almost as inimical as that of the Germans to the peace of Europe , in pretensions and meaningless phrases about the future of civilization . The increasing demand for specific terms of peace is not more than an obvious inference from the rule that even nations at war should subordinate the use of armaments to an explicit and attainable public policy . It implies a reassertion of the controlling influence of public opinion on the policy of nations , and unless such an influence is vehemently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the war may avail nothing to fertilize the growth of a better community of nations . I N an exalted moment Tennyson once exclaimed that kind hearts are more than coronets and simple faith than Norman blood . This was a fine thing to say and it would be a poor task to impeach it , but there are times when another plank would seem to be needed in the human platform . If a man has kindness and sincerity , the poet seems to imply , what more can you ask ? Anything else does seem like painting the lily . But the case of the kind and sincere is not so simple . It is a sad fact that in dealing with errant human beings it is an immense inconvenience if they happen to be kind and sincere . Men who are wanton and evil are comparatively easy to deal with . Once establish their base motives and it is a pleasure to lock them up and chop off their heads . But the minute it ap ? pears that a misguided person is sincere and worthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimable miscreant . A good man gone astray is the most troublesome man alive . With most people it is assumed that if a man is kind and sincere he can not be misguided , and if he is misguided he can not be kind and sincere . But neither assumption is sound . It is not only true that People go astray who are good . It is equally true that people are good who go astray . It may disgust the ordinary man to have it said that cannibals are simply religious , like blue-nose Presbyterians . He can not endure the moral dis ? comfort of such a paradox . He insists on regarding cannibals as bloodthirsty knaves . You may know any number of cannibals personally . You may as ? sure him that , in spite of their dietetic peculiarity , they are positively ideal in their home life , paragons of religious conviction . He will not tolerate you . He will suspect that you are making a plea for your secret cannibalistic inclinations . But the real difficulty is not that people can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go astray Who are good . This difficulty is created by the fact that it is necessary to fight them . Believing them kind of heart and completely sincere , the natural thing is to veil or condone their error . It takes considerable imagination to remember they are good and yet attack them for going astray . If a man hasnever lived among cannibals it is easy enough to denounce them . The same is true of the man who has never lived among Presbyterians , or Douk ? hobors , or single-taxers , or Tammany men , or high-tariff men . But the difficult thing is , having lived among them , having got to like them personally , to realize their point of view , their kind heart and complete sincerity , still to believe them deeply and shockingly wrong . Spanking one 's own child is a pleasant pastime compared to opposing a really fine man who is whole-heartedly in error . As was said before , a good man gone astray , whether cannibal or verslibrist , is the most troublesome man alive . This reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Edward Bok of the Ladies ' Home Journal , a book entitled " Why I Believe in Poverty . " To those who hate poverty as they hate deformity or disease , this title will at once be ar ? resting . It will sound about as attractive as a title saying , " Why I Favor Whooping Cough " or " Why I Advocate Glass Eyes . " It will probably lead them to remember their misgivings about the Ladies ' Home Journal , to recall with pleasure what one observer said of such journals : " excellent in workmanship and deficient in intelligence and sub ? stantial originality . What is encouraged and cul ? tivated is adroitness of style and a piquant presenta ? tion of commonplaces . Harmlessness , not to say pointlessness , and an edifying , gossipy optimism are the substantial characteristics . " The first impulse on reading " Why I Believe in Poverty " will un ? doubtedly be a desire to demolish Mr. Bok . But if one has charity for the kind heart and simple faith of a cannibal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bok ? In our opinion he is an excellent example of the good man gone astray , not to be maligned on that account , and equally not to be condoned . In this little book , published in the Riverside Uplift Series ( " uplift " is now a catchpenny word ) , Mr. Bok tells us of his own hard climb out of poverty . He speaks unaffectedly of his stern early experience , of daytime work as an office-boy , evening work as a reporter , and stenography studied into the night . " It meant effort , of course , un ? tiring , ceaseless , and unsparing , and it meant work , hard as nails . " But having climbed up and out , Mr. Bok exults in his adventure , " the greatest blessing in the way of the deepest and fullest experience that can come to a boy . " For think of what Mr. Bok believes he can as ? cribe to poverty ? he ascribes himself , and more than this can no man . " Out of the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience ; the up-building ; the development ; the capacity to under ? stand and sympathize ; the greatest heritage that can come to a boy .
