Continuing our detailed analysis of the Civil Rights Bill as it now stands before the Senate , we examine today Titles 5 and 6 . Title 5 provides merely for extending the life of the Civil Rights Commission for another four years , almost a routine matter . But Title 6 deals with a much more difficult and complex question : discrimination by state and local officials in the use of Federal aid funds . This is a particularly troubling problem that has agitated Congress for years . An elaborate mechanism to deal with it is set up in the pending bill . First it repeals all inconsistent provisions of Federal statutes and declares that no person shall be subjected to discrimination " under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . " Then it directs agencies handling certain programs , not including Federal insurance activities , to take definite steps to carry out this purpose  --  including , if necessary , termination of aid to any institution that continues to discriminate . Actual withholding of funds can come only after a series of protective steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President before taking effect . Before funds are withheld for violation of agency rules , there must be an effort to obtain voluntary compliance , a hearing and 30 days ' notice to the appropriate Congressional committees . Any final decision to stop funds is made subject to judicial review . The title does not require suspension of an aid program to an entire state if one county or institution discriminates . The action would be directed only at that place or facility . The title has nothing to do with Federal installations such as Army camps . Its exception to mandatory action for insurance programs was written in to make clear that the individual farmer 's crop insurance , the citizen 's bank deposit insurance or the homeowner 's mortgage guarantee could not be cut off . Even with all the safeguards written into the title , we admit to some disquiet at the idea of cutting off Federal funds . But it is important to keep some considerations in mind . One is the unfairness of excluding some citizens from the benefits of Government funds . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , it is outrageous that Negroes should not be allowed to swim in it . A second point is that any Southern community can escape the threat of losing Federal support simply by ending its racial discrimination and complying with the Constitution . There is , third , the practical consideration that the administrator of any Federal program will believe in it and will do anything he can to keep it going . The likelihood is that in almost every case the Government would sue to end discrimination in a state facility ? as Titles 3 and 4 of the pending legislation would allow it to do ? rather than cut off aid . The Administration originally proposed to end the matter there , by authorizing suits . But the House felt that action to end discriminatory use of Federal money should be mandatory , not discretionary . We have come to the conclusion that if the issue is not faced now , it will have to be later . We think , on balance , that Congress should make its decision now and declare that in the rare case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid to one race only .
