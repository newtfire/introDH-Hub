WASHINGTON ' S FAREWELL ADDRESS ART . YIII. -1 . An Inquiry into the Formation of Washington 's Farewell Address . Philadelphia : Parry and McMillan . 1859 . Svo. pp. 250. 2 . The Leaders of the Old Bar of Philadelphia . Philadelphia . 1859. 8vo. pp. 120 . IN the Triennial Catalogue of Harvard University , the Class of 1797 presents a rare assemblage of venerated names . Of those no longer living , it may suffice to specify IRev . Dr. Church , one of the profoundest theologians and most efficient Christian ministers of his generation ; William Merchant Richardson , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire , distinguished equally for quick and keen intuition and for large attainments in professional and general learning ; Asahel Stearns , for many years the head of the Cambridge Law School , whom none knew without bearing in life-long remembrance his meekness of wisdom , his gentleness of spirit , and his abounding charity in word and deed ; and John Collins Warren , who in the department of anatomy and surgery occupied for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has left his equals or superiors , contributed largely toward making them so , alike by the prestige of his own sucQess , and by the facilities for professional study and practice furnished more or less directly through his agency or influence . Among the surviving members of this class are Rev. Dr. Jenks , whose rich and varied scholarship might have won for him a world-wide reputation , had not all else been held secondary to his higher calling as a Christian man and minister ; and Hon. Daniel Appleton White , than whom liberal culture has no more efficient friend and patron , and virtue and religion no exemplar more worthy of reverence . Equally loved and honored with his classmates whom we have named , the peer of the foremost of them in ability , learning , and personal excellence , is Horace 3inney , the author of the works whose titles we have placed at the head of this article . For many years Mr. Binney was the acknowledged leader of the Bar of Philadelphia , while as an advocate in the Supreme Court of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of the most important cases before that tribunal . It is believed that the legal literature of the country contains no more luminous or cogent argument than his defence of the City of Philadelphia in the celebrated Girard College case , in which Webster was leading counsel for the heirs at law . The preservation of the magnificent endowment devised under Girard 's will , and its ultimate appropriation to its beneficent purpose , are chiefly due to the skill and doquence with which Mr. Binney maintained the competency of the municipal corporation to the trust , and rebutted the objections grounded on certain singular restrictions enjoined by the testator . During General Jackson 's administration , Mr. Binney held a seat in Congress , and was recognized as secoiid in talent and influence to no member of the Opposition in the House of Representatives . His speech on the Removal of the Deposits from the United States Bank was regarded as the ablest speech delivered in the House against that measure . His rank at the Bar led to his frequent appointment as the eulogist of distinguished jurists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen to the memory of Chief Justice Marshall , Chief Justice Tilghman of Pennsylvania , Judge Bushirod Washington , Charles C bauncey , and John Sargeant . His style in these biographical sketches is clear , classical , and vigorous ; his portraiture of character vivid and discrirninating ; his eulogy calm , but glowing , attaching itself uniformly to the highest traits of character , and , where most fervent , judicially impartial . His integrity , benevolence , and patriotism have secured for him the undivided respect and honor of his fellow-citizens ; while the Christian virtues that gave grace and strength to his active years make his old age beautiful and venerable . His political principles were formed in the school of Washington ; to these he has adhered with the tenacity of sincere conviction through all the conflicts of opinion and mutations of party ; and we trust that he is not alone in the belief that it is only by a return to them that our national honor is to be retrieved , and the continued existence of our Federal Union to be assured against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration and among the antagonistic sections of the republic . // Jan . WASHINGTON ' S FAREWELL ADDRESS The Works Which we ROW propose to examine display no token of octogenarian authorship except ripened wisdom . The author 's powers are manifestly in their full vigor . In precision , conciseness , and strength , his statements and arguments are faultless specimens of their kind , He constantly reminds us of one , his senior by several years , the venerable Josiah Quincy , whose ability and fame have been culminating during the period of life which we are prone to associate with decline and decay . Such instances , connected as they always are with rigid obedience to the Creator 's laws of temperance , self-control , diligence , and benevolence , go far toward warranting the belief that the painful liabilities of declining years are ( no doubt with exceptional cases ) to be ascribed rather to the faults , errors , or negligences of their subjects than to the inevitable course of nature . We can not believe it the will of Providence that large numbers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the conviction has often been forced upon us , that men who have filled well and nobly their part in active life are prone to sink into imbecility and dotage , simply because they imagine that the due time for repose and inactivity has arrived . The faculties of mind are kept bright and true by continuous use ; unemployed , they fail and vanish . The composition of Washington 's Farewell Address has become of late , as our readers are aware , a subject of even heated controversy . The public in general till recently regarded the venerated first President as its sole author ; while those more conversant with the history of the times knew that it was at least submitted to Alexander Hamilton for his friendly suggestions , without supposing that he bore any important part in giving it the form in which it was placed before the country . Evidence has meanwhile transpired , which renders it certain that , so far as authorship in the literary sense is concerned , that document is Hamilton 's rather than Washington 's ; while its conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not one whit the less to be ascribed to him whose name it bears . Yet in many minds there is a reluctance to yield assent in this matter even to documentary proof hardly less than de // monstrative . It is felt that Washington 's reputation and honor are involved in the intimation that he could have put his name to an Address not strictly his own , or that , if indebted to his friend in whole or in part for the composition of the Address , he should have suppressed the fact . We would reply , that , if Washington valued this document on the score of its literary merit , or expected by means of it to establish his fame as an author , then his integrity is impeached by the theory which ascribes its authorship to another hand . But if Washington 's sole aim was to place before the people of the United States his views of the past , present , and future of the Federal Union , his parting counsels , and his paternal admonitions , in the most efficient form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was conscious that his own pen was less adequate to the task than that of a more practised writer , then it was not only his right , but his duty , to avail himself of the best services at his command ; nor was he under the slightest obligation to impair the force and interest of his solemn valedictory by connecting the name of the r*dacteur with his own , any more than he was bound to designate the relative proportions of his own and another 's phraseology in each of the very numerous official documents which , during his military and civil career , were compiled from his minutes by his various secretaries . Where the question is not as to words , but as to sentiments , the maxim of the law , Qui facit per aliumfacit per Se , holds good in authorship . No man knew himself more thoroughly than Washington , and it is impossible that lie could ever have regarded himself as skilled in literary composition , or have looked forward to eminence as a writer among the claims which he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters and documents known to be his , his style is simple , direct , and explicit , but bald and fragmentary . Successive ideas were arranged by no rhetorical plan , in no logical order , and with no continuous flow of diction , but jotted down abruptly , and without connective clauses , as they occurred spontaneously to his mind , or were called up by casual associations . His military training , and his incessantly busy life through the entire period in which the graces of diction might have been cultivated , pre-18* // WASHINGTON 'S FAREWELL ADDRESS eluded the abundant leisure and the careful practice by which alone he could have become a master of sentences , as he was of noble deeds . It is well known , that , from an early period of his military life to the day of his death , he was never without a secretary of competent literary ability , and that it was his wont to commit to others the composition in whole or in part of important documents . This is what public men in our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it not well understood , and a fact that carries no reproach with it , that the Messages of the chief magistrates of our nation and of our several States are often compiled from contributions sent in by those specially conversant with particular departments of the administration ? And is it not much more creditable to the head of a government , that he should employ in communications which deserve such careful elaboration the best skilled pens in each several branch of the public service , than that he should sacrifice accuracy and thoroughness to the mere pride of authorship ? Even Reports of Committees of Congress , bearing the names of distinguished statesmen , have often owed their ultimate form to extra-Congressional pens , and have been only the more valuable because they were prepared by persons remote from the harassing labors and distracting complications which fall to the lot of legislators worthy of their name and office . What then could have been more obviously the dictate of sound discretion and patriotism , than that our first President - an unpractised writer - should have sought , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai , d of one whose skill as a writer he had tested by long and frequent use , and whose sympathy with himself in political opinions was a sufficient guaranty for his faithfulness in the execution of this trust ? And if Washington himself furnished the first draft , gave his assent to the modifications proposed , and revised the finished document , was he not for all practical purposes as truly its author as if he had written it with his own hand , without consultation or aid ? Then , as to the matter of concealment , this charge could rest against Washington only under circumstances which would leave it without proof . If he had burned all evidences of authorship in his own keeping , and enjoined it upon Hamilton // to destroy all letters and papers relating to the Farewell Address , there would be ground for this imputation . But if all the papers relating to the Farewell Address ( as is the case , with a single by uo means important exception ) were left on file by both Washington and Hamilton , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their documents on file the property of the public , then was the transaction as fair and open as in the nature of the case it could have been ; for oral communication on the subject would have involved a sacrifice of self-respect and personal dignity on the one side , and an equal sacrifice of modesty and delicacy on the other . But we are not left to conjecture as to what Washington would have deemed worthy of himself on such an occasion . We have his own precedent . When , near the close of his first Presidential term , he resolved in no case to be a candidate for re-election , he applied to Mr. Madison to prepare for him a suitable farewell address . In the letter conveying this request , which bears date the 20th of May , 1T92 , he refers to a previous conversation on the subject : " Permit me to reiterate the request II made to you at our last meeting , namely , to think of the proper time and best mode of announcing the intention of withdrawal from public office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this letter Washington specifies the topics that rest immediately on his mind as necessary to be adverted to , but evidently means to allow Mr. Madison a still wider range of remark , subject of course to his own approval . There certainly could not be from a principal to his agent in such a work a wider carte blanche than is implied in the following sentence : " To enumerate the various subjects which might be introduced into such an address would require thought , and to mention them to you would be unnecessary , as your own judgment will comprehend all that will be proper . " Mr. Madison prepared the desired valedictory ; but the President was meanwhile persuaded to give his reluctant assent to his own re-election , it being made evident to him that in no other way could partisan animosity be held in check , and prevented from developing an activity and bitterness which might prove fatal to our still infant republic . // This transaction appropriately holds the first place in the series of incidents Which form the basis of Mr. Binney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we beg leave to say a few Words as to the intent , tone , and spirit of this work . It is written With the purpose , not of prolonging , but of allaying controversy . It is designed not to honor either of the illustrious men , the memory of whose scarcely interrupted friendship is obscured by this posthumous rivalry , at the expense of the other ; but to vindicate for each a reputation , not impaired , but exalted by their mutual aid in the production of that enduring memorial of their common patriotism . Mr. Binney was moved to his undertaking equally by a " profound veneration for the whole character of the Father of his Country , " and " an exalted respect for the intellectual and personal qualities of Hamilton " ; and his " Inquiry " can not fail to deepen both sentiments alike in the minds of his readers . He has brought together all the attainable facts and documents which form a part of the case at issue , and their statement and collocation constitute a body of evidence which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supersedes the necessity of argument . We rejoice that this service has been rendered by one who retains in clear remembrance the publication of the Farewell Address , who read it as soon as it reached the University of which he was then a member , and who still glows with the reverent enthusiasm with which it was received through the whole land . We propose now to pass in rapid review the history of the Address . Washington , in the first place , prepared a sketch of a valedictory address , which he had shown to Hamilton before the 10th of May , 1196 , at which date Hamilton wrote to him as follows - " When last in Philadelphia , you mentioned to me your wish , that 1 should redress a certain paper which you had prepared . As it is imthat thing of this kind should he done with great c portant a * are , and much at leisure touched and retouched , I suhmit a wish , that , as soon as you have given it the body you mean it to have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // with a letter containing the following passage , which evidently contemplated the entire recasting of the original draft . " Even if you should think it best to throw the whole into a different form , let me request , notwithstanding , that my draught may be returned to me ( along with yours ) with such amendments and corrections as to render it as perfect as the formation is susceptible of ; curtailed if too verbose ; and relieved of all tautology not necessary to enforce the ideas in the original or quoted part . My wish is that the whole may appear in a plain style , and be handed to the public in an honest , unaffected , simple garb . " - p. 45 . The paper thus transmitted consists of four parts . First , there is a brief preamble , reciting the occasion and purpose which gave rise and form to the Address . Then follows Madison 's draft prepared in 1792 . Then there is a series of " Hints , or Heads of Topics , " embracing the various subjects which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A review of the principles and motives of his administration forms an appropriate close . The original portioii of this sketch bears the peculiar marks of Washington 's style , was manifestly written with no attempt at elaborate composition , and could have been designed only as a series of suggestions for a more recondite paper , which should express the same sentiments in a form adapted to popular effect , and worthy to be preserved as the patriot 's legacy to his countrymen . It must have been subsequently to the receipt of this draft , that Hamilton prepared a brief found among his papers after death , and published in the seventh volume of his Works , with the indorsement in his own hand , - " Abstract of Points to form an Address . " This abstract contains twenty-three heads , with numerous subdivisions . The next document in order is the form of an address in Hamilton 's handwriting , in which the points concisely stated in the " Abstract " are developed in exactly the same order ; which bears little verbal or literary resemblance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical with the Farewell Address as given to the public . This is indorsed , " Copy of the original draft , considerably amended . " The indorsement is ambiguous . Its more obvious sense would indicate the document as itself a copy . But it is on rough paper , with many interlineations , and bears the // marks of having been itself the original draft ; and the necessary inference is , that the indorsement refers to an amended copy , and implies , - " The copy Which I have made of this original draft is considerably amended . " The amended copy Was sent to Washington on the 30th of July , and on the 10th of August Hamilton sent him another draft , suggesting the incorporation With the former of such materials as it might seem expedient to embody therewith . The subsequent correspondence shows that the corrected and amended copy of Hamilton 's original draft Was sent back with revisions and suggestions , and returned again to Washington . This paper is lost , and it is the only document of any importance relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Farewell Address Which are of doubtful authorship are those in which it varies from Hamilton 's original draft . These are very considerable in number ; but for the most part slight and merely verbal , only in a few , and those secondary , particulars involving the sentiments expressed , and but in a single instance indicating the transposition of the order of thought . In fine , the Address as it appeared bears just the relation of identity and discrepancy with Hamilton 's original draft , which would naturally result from the studious , careful , and reiterated revision of the two sagacious , wise , and foreseeing statesmen connected with its authorship . The missing paper , could it be discovered , would doubtless show the respective parts borne by Hamilton and Washington in the process by which the original draft became the published Address . As the case now stands , internal evidence alone can furnish grounds of conjecture . So far as the published Address surpasses in verbal finish the first draft , the modifications were probably due to Hamilton 's superior pencraft . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance of the document were undoubtedly made at the suggestion , or by the hand , of him in whose name and under whose sole responsibility it was given to the public . We have omitted in our r*'sum* many interesting details , for which we must refer our readers to Mr. Binney 's lucid exposition of them . We transcribe the following paragraphs from his closing summary of results - // " Washington was undoubtedly the original designer of the Farewell Address ; and not merely by general or indefinite intimation , but by the suggestion of perfectly definite subjects , of an end or object , and of a general outline , the same which the paper now exhibits . His outline did not appear so distinctly in his own plan , because the subjects were not so arranged in it as to show that they were all comprchendcd within a regular and proportional figure ; but when they came to be so arranged in the present Address , the scope of the whole design is seen to be contained within the limits he intended , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate precision , though without due connection , with little expansion , and with little declared bearing of the parts upon each other , or towards a common centre ; but they may now be followed with ease in their proper relations and bearing in the finished paper , such only excepted as he gave his final consent and approbation to exclude . " In the most common and prevalent sense of the word among literary men , this may not , perhaps , be called authorship ; but in the primary etymological sense , - the quality of imparting growth or increase , - there can be no doubt that it is so . By derivation from himself , the Farewell Address speaks the very mind of Washington . The fundamental thoughts and principles were his ; but he was not the composer or writer of the paper . " Hamilton was , in the prevalent literary sense , the composer and writer of the paper . The occasional adoption of Washington 's language does not materially take from the justice of this attribution . The new plan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of it . He put together the thoughts of Washington in a new order , and with a new bearing ; and while , as often as he could , he used the words of Washington , his own language was the general vehicle , both of his own thoughts , and for the expansion and combination of Washington 's thoughts . Hamilton developed the thoughts of * and corroborated them - included several cognate subjects , and added many effective thoughts from his own mind , and united all into one chain by the links of his masculine logic . " The main trunk was Washington 's ; the branches were stimulated by Hamilton ; and the foliage , which was not exuberant , was altogether his ; and he , more than Washington , pruned and nipped ofl with severe discrimination , whatever was excessive , - that the tree might bear the fruits which Washington desired , and become his full and fit representative . " - pp. 169 , 170. // 216 WASHINGTON 'S FAREWELL ADDRESS biographical sketches of the three members of the Philadelphia Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period when Mr. Binney first entered on the practice of his profession . Of these three William Lewis was the oldest , and though in local reputation not without rivals , he had a more extended fame as a lawyer than any one of his associates , - having enjoyed very much the same kind of national distinction with Theophilus Parsons of Massachusetts and Luther Martin of Baltimore . He came to the Bar just before the adoption of the State Constitution of 1776 . His attainments in classical and general literature were slight , though he was a purist in language , and seems , with some faults of taste , to have been far from deficient in the graces of forensic eloquence . We infer , from hints by no means unambiguous , that in manners , habits , and morals he had no very elevated standard , and , while not grossly reprehensible , was far from being exemplary . He was profound in his knowledge of the common law , and especially in the law of treason , under which there were many prosecutions in Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was counsel for John Fries in his first trial before Mr. Justice Iredell , and on his second trial , before Mr. Justice Chase of Maryland , threw up his brief and declined going on with the case , on account of the unprecedented procedure of the Court in preparing copies of their opinion on the questions of law involved , to be given to the jury when impanelled , - a transaction which was subsequently made one of the articles of impeachment against the presiding judge . The opinion of the Court was acknowledged as sound ; but it was contended that in criminal cases the jury were judges both of the law and the facts , and that by imperative instructions preceding the trial their right of free deliberation was invaded . The trial proceeded , the judge pledging himself in the absence of counsel that the accused should be fairly dealt with ; a verdict of guilty was the result ; but the executive pardon that ensued was probably due in great part to this judicial usurpation . Mr. Lewis possessed consummate skill and enjoyed unrivalled reputation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and conflicts of law incident to the unsettled condition of the country 's // infancy and the incipient working of the national and state constitutions . He was greatly interested in the abolition of slavery in Pennsylvania , and was the draftsman and earnest advocate of the Act of the Legislature of fl80 , by which provision was made for gradual emancipation . We quote the following passage , both as indicating the distinguished regard in which Mr. Lewis 's legal acumen was held by the first statesman of his age and country , and as exhibiting the strength and tenacity of the author 's political opinions , formed at that early day and in its school of equally profound wisdom and uncorrupt integrity . " During the two administrations of Washington , and continuously during life , Mr. Lewis was a thorough Federalist , amusingly antiGallican , and entirely anti-Jeffersonian ; and upon law questions of difficulty that arose in the Executive Department , though he was not an official adviser , he was familiarly consulted by General Hamilton , the Secretary of the Treasury , with whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton 's life . The memorable argument of Hamilton , in 1791 , upon the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States , or rather of the Bill to incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank , was read to Mr. Lewis before it was sent to the President , as I have beard from Mr. Lewis himself as well as from one of General Hamilton 's sons ; but I have never heard a surmise that it was in any respect altered in consequence of this . Its great principles were discussed between the two , sitting in Mr. Lewis 's office , or walking in his garden , until all the reasons of the Secretary of the Treasury , and the answers to the objections of the Secretary of State , and of the Attorney-General , were scrupulously examined and weighed . No lawyer could have been better in such a consultation than Mr. Lewis , who was fertile in the suggestion of doubts , and quick in the solution of them , and had an admirable coup d'eil to discern the strong and weak points of assault and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be remembered , first enunciated the great rules of interpretation by which the powers delegated by the people of the United States to Congress were to be construed ; and they were afterwards tested by the Supreme Tribunal of Federal law , and stood the test then and for sixty years from the adoption of the Constitution . I hope to be excused for thinking that no juridical argument , before or since , has shaken , or ever will shake , those rules of interpretation ; and that none other can maintain the constitutional relations of the States and the United States , the one to // the other , and give superiority to each in its proper sphere . How much the battle-axe of party may make the lighter scale in some measures the heavier in all , remains for future history . None but a parricidal arm would cast it in ; nor can it remain there very long without deranging the orbit of each system , and generating a new centre of gravitation , when both systems may be folded up as a vesture . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument , they mean that the United States shall not be administered by a fair construction of the Constitution , but by the platforms of party . " - pp. 26 - 28 . The next biography in order is that of Edward Tilghman . He received his legal education in the Middle Temple , and for two or three years was an assiduous attendant upon the Courts in Westminster Hall , taking copious notes of the arguments in Chancery before Lord Apsley , and at the King 's Bench before Lord Mansfield and his associate Judges . He was profoundly learned in his profession , and in the obscure chapter of contingent remainders and executory devises is believed to have had no superior . He was at once acute and eloquent as an advocate , and was distinguished for the conciseness , directness , and simplicity of his arguments . " When he began , he generally meant to say all that he afterwards said , rarely or never leaving his path ; and when his argument was at an end , he did not utter a word to round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no supplemental answers to objections , - all had been noticed and disposed of in due order as he advanced . " His discernment of the points of a ease had the quickness of intuition ; but for this he was indebted , not only to his native sagacity , but at least equally to the thoroughness of his Transatlantic training , and to his unremitting diligence as a student . His acquirements in classical and general literature were large and various , and they at once gave grace to his oratory and zest to his social intercourse . Of genial temper , conciliating address , and fine conversational powers , constant in his friendships , true to all the relations of home and society , pure , upright , and generous , he won by his virtues an esteem and reverence corresponding with his brilliant professional reputation . Near the close of his life , he incurred pecuniary losses involving almost the whole of his fortune , and obliging him to part with his carriage and his city residence . This // reverse he sustained with undisturbed fortitude , serenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixty-fifth year of his age . The remaining portrait is that of Jared Ingersoll , Mr. Binney 's own legal instructor . He was born in New Haven in 1750 . His father , of the same name , an eminent lawyer , was one of the agents of the Colony of Connecticut in England at the time of the passage of the Stamp Act , and returned to his native Colony with the commission of Stamp-master , which the popular indignation compelled him to resign . The son was sent to London in 1774 , to complete his legal education . He established himself in Philadelphia in 1778 , continued for many years in the active practice of his profession , and died in 1822 . Mr. Binney regards him as " without comparison the most efficient manager of an important jury trial among all the able men who were then at the Bar of Philadelphia . " In the ence and tactics of his profession he was unsurpassed . He was far from uniform in his mental activity , and in the passive state of his faculties his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little confidence in his own judgment ; but , when fairly aroused , " he saw and heard everything that concerned his cause , both that which promoted and that which impaired his chance of success ; and every needful principle of law , with its qualifications , was present to him ; all the strength and weakness of his position , all the concessions of his adversaries , however unemphatic or slight , and the minutest facts that were in evidence on either side . " He was a man of singular personal dignity , rigid honor , conscientious fidelity , immaculate virtue , and high religious principle . In Mr. Binney 's closing remarks he animadverts with just severity on the change in the tenure of judicial office in his own and other States . It is a change , we believe , fraught with evil and danger . Yet we are not sure that it is more worthy of reprehension than the method which one of our smaller New England States may claim the doubtful honor of having originated , and which seems to be inaugurated as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nominally that of good behavior , - the method , we mean , by which a Court is abolished by the Legislature , not // because its organization is to be superseded by a better , nor even because its members are believed to be unworthy of the public confidence , but solely because the judgeships are held by the party in the minority , and are wanted as rewards for the adherents of the party in power . Far better is it , as it seems to us , that the judges should know at the outset the brief term of years for which , if unimpeached , they are sure of office , than that the rod of party should be shaken over their heads at every annual election . Under the system by which the tenure of judicial office is actually that of good behavior , the tendency of the office is to withdraw its incumbent entirely from the arena of party politics , and to generate the independent , impartial habits of mind which alone can render our courts of justice worthy of reliance . Instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - instances in which violent partisans have lost at once on their appointment all vestiges of their former prejudices and animosities , and from arrant demagogues have become the firm and equal ministers of right , law , and equity , without fear or favor , - are not infrequent in our judicial history . Eminent cases in point on the Bench of the Supreme Court of the United States will occur , we think , to many of our readers . But where the election to , or continuance in , judicial office is dependent on the popular suffrage , the judge has every inducement of interest to adapt his official course to the wishes of the dominant party ; or if he be too upright to bend to their dictation , the very ground of his competency will be made the reason for superseding him at the next election . A judge in a neighboring State , eminent equally for learning , ability , and integrity , who has since paid the forfeit of his independence by failure in a popular election , but who had held his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , by election , told us that in his own consciousness the former was the only safe tenure , - that every interested motive was under the old r*g'ime on the side of fairness and impartiality ; while with the contingencies of a re-election in view , he found interest and conscience at fearful antagonism . While we are writing , we learn from the New York press , that Judge Harris of Albany , one of the most able // and competent members of the highest tribunal in New York , a man whom to know is to honor , has lost his election becanse he had given offence to the Anti-Rent faction . If a party which exists in defiance of law , and whose policy is riot and murder , can thus avenge itself on the Judiciary of the Empire State , what security for vested rights can the constituted tribunals of that Commonwealth proffer ? On this subject , however , in lieu of any further comments of our own , we prefer copying the strong and well-considered remarks of Mr. Binney . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compels our judges to enter the arena of a popular election for their offices , and for a term of years so short , as to keep the source of their elevation to the Beach continually before their eyes . At least once again in the life of every judge , we may suppose he will be compelled by a necessity , much stronger than at first , to enter the same field ; and the greater the necessity , the less will his eyes ever close upon the fact . It is this fact , re-eligibility to office , with the hope of re-election , that puts a cord around the neck of every one of them , during the whole term of his office . It is transcendently worse than the principle of original election at the polls . Doubtless there is more than one of the judges who had rather be strangled by the cord , than do a thing unworthy of his place ; but the personal characteristics of a few , are no oToun ( ls of inference as to the many ; nor are even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischiefs that are in reserve . We must confess that a system is perilous which holds out to the best judge , if he displeases a powerful party , nothing better than the poorhouse , which a late eminent Chief Just.ice saw before him , and committed the great fault of his life by confessing and avoiding it . The mind of the public , of all parties , is becoming apprehensive upon the subject ; and well may it be so , even among party men , for parties change suddenly , and once in every five or ten years , we may be sure that the chalice will come round to the lips of those who have drugged it . No man can be too apprehensive of the evil who thinks the law worth preservin* as a security for what he possesses , and no lawyer who regards it as a security for his honor and reputation . For what can it give of either , if the wheels of the instrument receive a twist or bias through party fear or favor , or are so ignorantly and presumptuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other until they work falsely or uncertainly ? 19* // " At the formation of the Federal Constitution in 1787 , the tenure of the judicial department was thought by our forefathers to be not only the guaranty of that department , but the best guaranty of all the departments of government . What guaranty is there for the Constitution itself , if you emasculate the judicial department , the only one that is a smooth , practical , wakeful , and efficient defence against invasions of the Constitution by the Legislature , - the only one that can he efficient in a republican representative government , whose people will not bear a blow , and therefore require a guaranty whose blow is a word ? A leasehold elective tenure by the judiciary , is a frightful solecism in such a government . It enfeebles the guaranty of other guaranties , - the trial by jury , the writ of habeas corpus , the freedom and purity of elections by the people , and the true liberty and responsibility of the press . It takes strength from the only arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives it to those who have no general intelligence to this end , in the use of it , and therefore no ability to use it for their own protection . The certainty and permanence of the law depend in great degree upon the judges ; and all experience misleads us , and the very demonstrations of reason are fallacies , if the certainty and permanence of the judicial office by the tenure of good behavior are not inseparably connected with a righteous , as well as with a scientific administration of the law . What can experience or foresight predict for the result of a system , by which a body of men , set apart to enforce the whole law at all times , whatever may be the opposition to it , and whose duty is never so important and essential as when it does so against the passions of a present majority of the polls , is made to depend for office upon the fluctuating temper of a majority , and not upon the virtue of their own conduct ?
