REMINISCENCES OF JULIA WARD HOWE . VI . JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE ; IN WAR TIME ; BOSTON RADICAL CLUB . I MUST here ask leave to turn back a little in the order of my reminiscences , my narrative having led me to pass by certain points that I wish to mention . The great comfort which I had in Parker 's preaching caine to an end when my children attained an age at which it appeared desirable that they should attend public worship . Concerning this my husband argued as follows - " The children our two eldest girls are now of an age at which they should receive impressions of reverence . They should , therefore , see nothing at the Sun . day service which would militate against that feeling . At Parker 's meeting , mdi. viduals read the newspapers before the exercises begin . A good many persons come in after the prayer , and some go out before the conclusion of the sermon . These irregularities offend my sense of decorum , and appear to me inadmissible in the religious education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to comply with my husband 's wishes in this matter . I said of it to his friend , Horace Mann , that to give up Parker 's ministry for any other would be like going to the synagogue when Paul was preaching near at hand . Parker was soon made aware of Dr. Howe 's views , but no estrangement ensued between the two friends . He did , indeed , write my husband a letter , in which he laid great stress upon the depth and strength of his own concern in religion . My husband cherished an old predilection for King 's Chapel , and would have been pleased if I had chosen to attend service there . My mind , however , was otherwise disposed . Having heard Parker , at the close of one of his discourses , speak in warm commendation of James Freeman Clarke , announcing at the same time that Mr. Clarke was about to begin a new series of services at Williams Hall , I determined that I would hear him . With Mr. Clarke I had already some slight acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and having met him on divers occasions . It is well known that , during his first pastorate in Boston , he once invited Theodore Parker to occupy his pulpit . The feeling against the latter was then so strong as to cause an influential part of the congregation to withdraw from the society , which thereafter threatened to decline for want of funds . Some years later Mr. Clarke resigned his charge , and went abroad for a prolonged stay , possibly with indefinite ideas as to the future employment of his life . He was possessed of much literary and artistic taste , and might easily have added one to the number of those who , like George Bancroft , Jared Sparks , and others , had entered the Unitarian ministry , to leave it , after a few years , for fields of labor in which they were destined to achieve greater success . Fortunately , the suggestion of such a course , if entertained by him at all , did not prevail . Mr. Clarke 's interest in the Christian ministry was too deeply grounded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sojourn in Europe , he sought to gather again those of his flock who had held to him and to one another . He found them ready to welcome him back with unabated love and trust . It was at this juncture that I heard Theodore Parker make the mention of him which brought him to my remembrance ; bringing me also , very reluctantly , to his new place of worship . // The hall itself was unattractive , and the aspect of its occupants decidedly unfashionable . Indeed , a witty friend of mine once said to me that the bonnets seen there were of so singular a description as constantly to distract her attention from the minister 's sermon . This absence of fashion rather commended the place to me ; for I had had in my life enough and too much of that churchgoing in which the bonnets , the pews , and the doctrine appear to rest on one dead level of conventionalism . Mr. Clarke 's preaching was as unlike as possible to that of Theodore Parker . While his ministrations were not wanting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of the questions which at that time were foremost in the mind of the community , there ran through their whole course an exquisite tone of charity and good will . He had not the philosophic and militant genius of Parker , but he had a genius of his own , poetical , harmonizing . In after years I esteemed myself fortunate in having passed from the drastic discipline of the one to the tender and reconciling ministi'y of the other . The members of the congregation were mostly strangers to me , yet I felt from the first a respect for them . In process of time I came to know something of their antecedents , and to make friends among them . With John Albion Andrew - afterward our great war governor - I was already well acquainted . He had grown to be a dear familiar in our household before he became known to the world at large as governor of Massachusetts . He was , indeed , a typical American of the best sort . Most happy in temperament , with great vitality and enjoyment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick perception and calm deliberation . His judgments were broad , sound , and charitable , his tastes at once simple and comprehensive . He was at home in high society , and not less so among the lowly . He was very genial , and much " given to hospitality , " but without show or pretense . He had been one of the original members of the Church of the Disciples , and had certainly been drawn toward Mr. Clarke by a deep and genuine religious sympathy . After some years of attendance at Williams Hall , our society , somewhat increased in numbers , removed to Indiana Place Chapel , where we remained until we were able to erect for ourselves the commodious and homelike building which we occupy to-day . Our minister was a man of much impulse , but of more judgment . In his character were blended the best traits of the conservative and of the liberal . His ardent temperament and sanguine disposition bred in him that natural hopefulness which is so important an element in all attempted reform . His sound mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures of society , while a fortunate power of apprehending principles rendered him very steadfast , both in advance and in reserve . In the agitated period which preceded the civil war , and in that which followed it , he , in his modest pulpit , became one of the leaders , not of his own flock alone , but of the community to which he belonged . I. can imagine few things more instructive and desirable than was his preaching in those troublous times , so full of unanswered question and unreconciled discord . His church was like an organ , with deep undertones and lofty , aspiring treble , - the master hand pressing the keys , the heart of the congregation responding with a full melody . Festivals of sorrow were held in Indiana Place Chapel , and many of them , - James Buchanan 's hollow fast , a day of mourning for John Brown , and , saddest and greatest of all , a solemn service following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . We were led through these shadows of death by the radiant light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held before us . Among the many who // stood by him in his labors of love was a lady possessed of rare taste in the arrangement of floral and other decorations . We came at last to confer on her the title of the flower saint . On the occasion last mentioned , when we entered the building , full of hopeless sorrow , we saw pulpit and altar adorned with a rich violet pall , on which , at intervals , hung wreaths of white lilies . So something of the pomp of victory was mingled with our bitter sense of loss . The nation 's chief was gone , but with the noble army of martyrs we now beheld him , crowned with the unfading glory of his work . Mr. Clarke 's life possesses an especial interest from the fact of its having been one of those rare lives which start in youth with an ideal , and follow it through manhood to old age ; parting from it only at the last breath , and bequeathing it to posterity in its full growth and beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free church , whose pews should not be sold , whose seats should be open to all , with no cumbrous encounter of crossinterests , a church of true worship and earnest interpretation , which should be held together by the bond of veritable sympathy . This living church he built out of his own devout and tender heart . A dream at first , he saw it take shape and grow , and when he flitted from its sphere he felt that it would stand and endure . Let me here record my belief that society rarely attains anywhere a higher level than that which all must recognize in the Boston of the last forty years . The religious philosophy of the Unitarian pulpit ; the intercourse with the learned men of Harvard College , more frequent formerly than at present ; the inheritance of solid and earnest character , most precious of estates ; the nobility of thought developed in Margaret Fuller 's pupils ; the cordial piety of such leaders as Phillips Brooks , James Freeman Clarke , and Edward Everett Hale ; the presence of leading authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - all these circumstances combined have given to Massachusetts a halo of glory which time should not soon have power to dim . The decade preceding the civil war was indeed a period of much agitation . The anomalous position of a slave system in a democratic republic was beginning to make itself keenly felt . The extension of the slave system to the new territories , soon to constitute new states , became the avowed purpose of Southern politicians . The conscience of the North , lulled by financial prosperity , awoke but slowly to an understanding of the situation . To enlighten this conscience was evidently the most important task of public-spirited mew Among other devices to this end , a newspaper was established in Boston with the name of The Commonwealth . Its immediate object was to reach and convince that important portion of the body politic which distrusts rhetoric and oratory , but which sooner or later gives heed to dispassionate argument and the advocacy of plain issues . My husband took an active interest in the management of this paper , and indeed assumed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had great pleasure in assisting him . We began our work together every morning , - he supervising and supplying the political department of the paper , I doing what I could in the way of social and literary criticism . Among my contributions to the work were a series of notices of Dr. Holmes 's Lowell lectures on the English poets , and a paper on Mrs. Stowe and George Sand . The Commonwealth , which still exists , though in a different form , did good service in the battle of opinion which unexpectedly proved a prelude to the most important event in our history as a nation . S*metime in the fifties , my husband spoke to me of a very remarkable man , // of whom I should be sure to hear sooner or later . This man , Dr. Howe said , seemed to intend to devote his life to the redemption of the colored race from slavery , even as Christ had willingly offered his life for the salvation of mankind . It was enjoined upon me that I should not mention to any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not , I allowed the whole matter to pass out of my thoughts . It may have been a year or more later that Dr. Howe questioned me thus : " Do you remember that man of whom I spoke to you , - the one who wished to be a savior for the negro race ? " I replied in the affirmative . " That man , " said the doctor , " will call here this afternoon . You will receive him . His name is John Brown . " Thus admonished , I watched for the visitor , and prepared to admit him myself when he should ring at the door . This took place at our house in South Boston , where it was not at all undignified for me to open my own door . At the expected time I heard the bell ring , and , on answering it , beheld a middle-aged , middle-sized man , with hair and beard of amber color streaked with white . He looked a Puritan of the Puritans , forceful , concentrated , and selfcontained . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my great gratification at meeting one of whom I had heard so good an account . I saw him once again at Dr. Howe 's office , and then heard no more of him for some time . I can not tell how long after this it was that I took up the Transcript , one evening , and read of an attack made by a small body of men on the arsenal at Harper 's Ferry . Dr. Howe presently came in , and I told him what I had just read . " Brown has got to work , " he said . I had already arrived at the same conclusion . The rest of the story is matter of history : the failure of the slaves to support the movement initiated for their emancipation , the brief contest , the inevitable defeat and sur render , the death of the rash , brave man upon the scaffold . All this is known , and need not be repeated here . In speaking of it , my husband assured me that John Brown 's plan had not been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its failure . Brown had been led to hope that , upon a certain signal , the slaves from many plantations would come to him in such numbers that he and they would become masters of the situation with little or no bloodshed . Neither he nor those who were concerned with him had it at all in mind to stir up the slaves to acts of cruelty and revenge . The plan was simply to combine a considerable body of them in a position so strong that the question of their freedom would be decided then and there , possibly without even a battle . I confess that the whole scheme am peared to me wild and chimerical . Of its details I knew nothing . None of us could exactly approve an act so revolutionary in its character , yet the greathearted attempt enlisted our sympathies strongly . The weeks of John Brown 's imprisonment were very sad ones , and the day of his death was one of general mourning in New England . Even there , however , people were not all of the same mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig-headed old fool . The record of John Brown 's life has been fully written , and by a friendly hand . I will only mention here that he had much to do with the successful contest which kept slavery out of the territory of Kansas . He was a leading chief in the border warfare which swept back the pro-slavery immigration attempted by some of the wild spirits of Missouri . In this struggle , he one day saw two of his own sons shot by the Border Ruffians ( as the Missourians of the border were then called ) , without trial or mercy . Some people thought that this dreadful sight had maddened his brain , as well it might . // I remember of him one humorous anecdote related to me by my husband . At one time , during the border war , he had taken several prisoners , and among them a certain judge . Brown was always a man of prayer . On this occasion , feeling quite uncertain as to whether he ought to spare the lives of the prisoners , he retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord long and fervently to inspire him with the right determination . The judge , overhearing this petition , was so much amused at it that , in spite of the gravity of his own situation , he laughed aloud . " Judge , " cried John Brown , " if you mock at my prayers , I shall know what to do with you without asking the Almighty ! " This brings me to the period of the civil war . What can I say of it that has not already been said ? Its cruel fangs fastened upon the very heart of Boston , and took from us our best and bravest . From many a stately mansion father or son went forth , followed by weeping , to be brought back for bitterer sorrow . The work of the women in providing comforts for the soldiers was unremitting . In organizing* and conducting the great bazaars which were held in furtherance of this object , many of these women found a new scope for their activities , and developed abilities hitherto unsuspected by themselves . Prominent among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor , John Albion Andrew . He would sometimes seek a refuge with us , when overpowered with the stress of official duties . He was a man in whom great geniality of temperament was united with an unwavering faith in principles , and a determination to abide by them . He was frequently called to the Capitol , and had mucl*m intercourse with President Lincoln . Soon after the close of the war he fell a victim to its long-continued fatigues and anxieties , and died of apoplexy , greatly mourned and honored . During the war Washington was naturally the centre of interest . Politicians of every grade , adventurers of either sex , inventors of all sorts of military appliances , and simple citizens , good and bad , flocked thither in large numbers . My own first visit to it was in the late autumn of 1861 , and was made in company with James Freeman Clarke , Governor Andrew , and my husband . Dr. Howe had already passed beyond the age of military service , but was enabled to render valuable aid as an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had in charge the condition and interests of the newly freed slaves . Although Dr. Howe had won his spurs , many years before this time , in the guerrilla contest of the Greek struggle for national life , his understanding of military operations continued to be remarkable . I do not remember that , throughout the course of the war , he was ever deceived by an illusory report of victory . He would carefully consider the plan of the battle , and when he said , " This looks to me like a defeat , " the later reports were sure to justify his surmise . As we approached the city , I saw , from time to time , small groups of armed men seated on the ground , near a fire . Dr. Howe explained to me that these were the pickets detailed to guard the railroad . The main body of the enemy 's troops was then stationed in the near neighborhood of Washington , and the capture of the national capital would have been of great strategic advantage to their cause . To render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encamped around the city , with General McClellan in command . Within the city limits mounted officers and orderlies galloped to and fro . Ambulances , drawn by four horses , were driven through the streets , stopping sometimes before Willard 's Hotel , where we had all found quarters . From my window I // saw the office of the New York Herald , and near it the ghastly advertisement of an agency for embalming and forwarding the bodies of those who had fallen in the fight or who had perished by fever . William Henry Channing , nephew of the great Channing , and heir to his spiritual distinction , had left his Liverpool pulpit , deeply stirred by love of his country and enthusiasm in a noble cause . On Sundays , his voice rang out , clear and musical as a bell , within the walls of the Unitarian church . I went more than once with him and Mr. Clarke to visit camps and hospitals . It was on the occasion of one of these visits that I made my first attempt at public speaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconnoitring expedition , the last stage of which was the headquarters of Colonel William Greene , of the 1st Massachusetts heavy artillery . Our friend received us with a warm welcome , and presently said to me , " Mrs. Howe , you must speak to my men . " Feeling my utter inability to do this , I ran away and tried to hide myself in one of the hospital tents . Colonel Greene twice found me and brought me back to his piazza , where at last I stood , and told , as well as I could , how glad I was to meet the brave defenders of our cause , and how constantly they were in my thoughts . Among my recollections of this period I especially cherish that of our interview with President Abraham Lincoln , arranged for us by our kind friend , Governor Andrew . The President was laboring at this time under a terrible pressure of doubt and anxiety . He received us in one of the drawing rooms of the White House , where we were invited to take seats , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation took place mostly between the President and Governor Andrew . I remember well the sad expression of Mr. Lincoln 's deep blue eyes , the only feature of his face which could be called other than plain . Mrs. Andrew , being of the company , inquired when we could have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Lincoln , and Mr. Lincoln named to us the day of her reception . He said to Governor Andrew , apropos of I know not what , " I once heerd George Sumner tell a story . " rhe unusual pronunciation fixed in my memory this one unimportant sentence . The talk , indeed , ran mostly on indifferent topics . When we had taken leave , and were out of hearing , Mr. Clarke said of Mr. Lincoln , " We have seen it in his face , hopeless honesty ; that is all . " He spoke as if he felt that it was far from enough . None of us knew then - how could we have known ? - how deeply God 's wisdom had touched and inspired that devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trusted him . Why did he not do this , or that , or the other ? He a President , indeed ! Look at this war , dragging on so slowly ! Look at our many defeats and rare victories ! Such was the talk that one constantly heard regarding him . The most charitable held that he meant well . Governor Andrew was one of the few whose faitl* in him never wavered . Meanwhile , through evil and good report , he was listening for the mandate which comes to one alone , bringing with it the decision of a mind convinced and of a conscience resolved . When the right moment came , he issued the proclamation of emancipation to the slaves . He sent his generals into the enemy 's country . He lived to welcome them as victors , to electrify the civilized world with his simple , sincere speech , to fall by the hand of an assassin , to bequeath to his country the most tragical and sacred of her memories . It would be impossible for me to say how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which I wrote the Battle Hymn of the Republic . I have also had occasion // more than once to state the simple story in writing . As this oft-told tale has no unimportant part in the story of my life , I will briefly add it to these records . I distinctly remember that a feeling of discouragement came over me , as I drew near the city of Washington , at the time already mentioned . I thought of the women of my acquaintance whose sons or husbands were fighting our great battle ; the women themselves serving in the hospitals , or busying themselves with the work of the Sanitary Commission . My husband was beyond the age of military service , my eldest son but a stripling ; my youngest was a child of not more than two years . I could not leave my nursery to follow the march of our armies , neither had I the practical deftness which the preparing and packing of sanitary stores demanded . Yet , because of my sincere desire , a word was given me to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field and of those who languished in the prisons . We were invited , one day , to attend a review of troops at some distance from the town . While we were engaged in watching the maneuvres , a sudden movement of the enemy necessitated immediate action . The review was discontinued , and we saw a detachment of soldiers gallop to the assistance of a small body of our men who were in imminent danger of being surrounded and cut off from retreat . The regiments remaining on the field were ordered to march to their cantonments . We returned to the city very slowly , of necessity , for the troops nearly filled the road . Mr. Clarke was in the carriage with me , as were several other friends . To beguile the rather tedious drive , we sang , from time to time , snatches of army songs ; concluding , I think , with " John Brown 's body lies a-mouldering in the ground ; His soul is marching on . " The soldiers seemed to like this , and answered back , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Howe , why do you not write some good words for that stirring tune ? " I replied that I had often wished to do this , but had not as yet found in my mind any leading toward it . I went to bed that night as usual , and slept quite soundly , according to my wont . I awoke in the gray of the morning twilight ; and as I lay waiting for the dawn , the long lines of the desired poem began to twine themselves in my mind . Having thought out all the stanzas , I said to myself , " I must get up and write these verses down , lest I fall asleep again and forget them . " So , with a sudden effort , I sprang out of bed , and found in the dimness an old stump of a pen , which I remembered to have used the day before . I scrawled the verses almost without looking at the paper . I had learned to do this when , on previous occasions , attacks of versification had visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recourse to a light lest I should wake the baby , who slept near me . I was always obliged to decipher my scrawl before another night intervened , as it was legible only while the matter was fresh in my mind . At this time , having completed my writing , I returned to bed and fell asleep , with the reflection , " I like this better than most things that I have written . " The poem , which was soon after published in The Atlantic Monthly , was somewhat praised on its appearance , but the vicissitudes of the war so engrossed public attention that small heed was taken of literary matters . I knew , and was content to know , that the poem soon found its way to the camps , as I heard now and these of its being sung in chorus by the soldiers . As the war went on , it came to pass that Chaplain McCabe , newly released from Libby Prison , gave a public lecture in Washington , and recounted some of his recent experiences . Among them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners occupied one large , comfortless room , in which the floor was their only bed . The official in charge of their quarters told them , one evening , that the Union army had just been terribly defeated . While they sat together in great sorrow , the negro who waited upon them whispered to one man that the officer had given them false information , and that , on the contrary , the Union soldiers had achieved an important victory . At this good news they all rejoiced , and presently made the walls ring with my Battle Hymn , which they sang in chorus , Chaplain McCabe leading . The lecturer recited the poem with such effect that those present began to inquire , " Who wrote this Battle Hymn ? " It became one of the leading lyrics of the war . In view of its success , one of my good friends said , " Mrs. Howe ought to die now , for she has done the best that she will ever do . " I was not of this opinion , feeling myself still " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guess at the new experiences which then lay before me . While the war was still at its height , I received a kind letter from Hon. George Bancroft , conveying an invitation to attend a celebration of the poet Bryant 's seventieth birthday , to be given by the New York Century Club , of which Mr. Bancroft was the newly elected president . He also expressed the hope that I would bring with me something in verse or in prose , to add to the tributes of the occasion . Having accepted the invitation and made ready my tribute , I repaired to the station on the day appointed , to take the train for New York . Dr. Holmes presently appeared , bound on the same errand . As we seated ourselves in the car , he said to me , " Mrs. Howe , I will sit beside you , but you must not expect me to talk , as I must spare my voice for this evening , when I am to read a poem at the Bryant celebration . " " By all means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also have a poem to read at the Bryant celebration . " The good doctor had overestimated his powers of abstinence from the iimterchange of thought which was so congenial to him . He at once launched forth in his ever brilliant vein , and we were within a few miles of our destination when we suddenly remembered that we had not taken time to eat our luncheon . I find in my diary of the time this record : " Dr. Holmes was my companion . His ethereal talk made the journey short and brilliant . " The journal further says : " Arriving in New York , Mr. Bancroft met us at the station , intent upon escorting Dr. Holmes , who was to be his guest . He was good enough to *vait upon me , also ; carried my trunk , which was a small one , himself , and lent me his carriage . He inquired about my poem , and informed me as to when it would be expected , in the order of exercises . . " At 8.15 drove to the Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Was conducted to the reception room , where I waited with those who were to take part in the performances of the evening . " I will add here that I saw , among others , N. P. Willis , already infirm in health , and looking like the ghost of his former self . There also was Dr. Francis Lieber , who said to me in a low voice , " Nur verwegen " ( Only be audacious ) . " Presently , a double line was formed to pass into the hall . Mr. Bancroft , Mr. Bryant , and I brought up the rear , Mr. Bryant giving me his arm . On the platform were three armchairs , which were taken by the two gentlemen and myself . " The assemblage was indeed a notable one . The fashion of New York was well represented , and the foremost artists , publicists , and literary men of the city were present . Mr. Emerson had come on from Concord . Christopher Cranch // united with other artists in presenting to the venerable poet a portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of his own . I afterward learned that T. Buchanan Read had arrived from Washington , having in his pocket his newly composed poem on Sheridan 's Ride , which he would gladly have read aloud , had the committee found room for it on their programme . A letter was received from the elder R. H. Dana , in which he excused his absence on account of his seventy-seven years and consequent inability to travel . Dr. Holmes read his verses very effectively . Mr. Emerson spoke rather vaguely . For my part in the evening 's proceedings , I will once more quote from the diary : - " Mr. Bryant , in his graceful reply to Mr. Bancroft 's address of congratulation , named me as she who has written the most stirring lyric of the war . ' " After Mr. Emerson 's remarks my poem was announced . I stepped to the middle of the platform , and read it well , I think , as every one heard me , and the large room was crammed . The last two verses were applauded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Holmes followed him . This was , I suppose , the greatest public honor of my life . I was requested to leave my poem in the hands of the committee for publication in a volume which would contain the other tributes of the evening . Dr. Holmes told me that he had declined to do this , and said in explanation , " I want my honorarium from The Atlantic Monthly . " We returned to Boston twenty-four hours later , by night train . Eschewing the indulgence of the sleeper , we talked through the dark hours . The doctor gave me the nickname of " Madame Comment " ( Madam How ) , and I told him that he was the most perfect of traveling companions . The Boston Radical Club appears to me one of the social developments most worthy of remembrance in the third quarter of the nineteenth century . Its meetings were held on the first Monday of every month , and the proceedings were limited to the reading and discussion of a paper , which rarely occupied more than an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it includes the most eminent thinkers of the day , in so far as Massachusetts is concerned . Among the speakers mentioned are Ralph Waldo Emerson , Dr. Hedge , David A. Wasson , 0 . B. Frothingham , John Weiss , Colonel Higginson , Benjamin Peirce , William Henry Chauning , C. C. Everett , and James Freeman Clarke . I remember , at one of these meetings , a rather sharp passage at arms between Mr. Weiss and James Freeman Clarke . Mr. Weiss had been declaiming against the insincerity of the pulpit , which he recognized in ministers who continue to use formulas of faith which have ceased to correspond to any real conviction . The speaker confessed his own shortcoming in this respect . " All of us , " he said , - " yes , I myself have prayed in the name of Christ , when my own feeling did not sanction its use . On hearing this , Mr. Clarke broke in . " Let Mr. Weiss answer for himself , " he said , with some vehemence of manner . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did not believe in what he said , it was John Weiss that lied , and not one of us . " He afterward asked me whether he had shown any heat when he spoke . I replied , " Yes , there was heat , but it was good heat . " Another memorable day at the club was that on which the eminent Protestant divine , Athanase Coquerel , spoke of religion and art in their relation to each other . After a brief but interesting review of classic , Byzantine , and mnedkeval art , M. Coquerel expressed his dissent from the generally received opinion that the Church of Rome had always been fore . // most in the promotion and patronage of the fine arts . The greatest of the Italian masters , he averred , while standing in formal relations with that Church , had often shown opposition to its spirit . Michael Angelo 's sonnets revealed a state of mind intolerant of ecclesiastical as of other tyranny . Raphael , in the execution of a papal order , had represented true religion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowed Protestants . He considei*ed the individuality fostered by Protestantism as most favorable to the development of originality in art . With these views Colonel Higginson did not agree . He held that Christianity had reached its highest point under the dispensation of the Catholic faith , and that the progress of Protestantisrn marked its decline . This assertion called forth a most energetic denial from Dr. Hedge , Mr. Clarke , and myself . I must mention a day on which , under the title of an essay on Jonathan Edwards , Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes favored the club with a very graphic exposition of old-time New England Calvinism . The brilliant doctor 's treatment of this difficult topic was appreciative and friendly , though by no means acquiescent in the doctrines presented . Nevertheless , Wendell Phillips thought the paper , on the whole , unjust to Edwards , and felt that there must have been in his doctrine another side not fully brought forward by the essayist . These and other speakers were heard with much interest , and the meeting was one of the best on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's orthodoxy was greatly valued among the anti-slavery workers , especially as the orthodox pulpits of the time gave them little support or comfort . I was told that Edmund Quincy , one day , saw Parker and Phillips walking arm in arm , and cried out : " Parker , do n't dare to pervert that man ! We want him as he is . " I was thrice invited to read before the Radical Club . The titles of my three papers were , Doubt and Belief , Limitations , Representation and How to Secure it . I must mention one more occasion at the Radical Club . I can remember neither the topic nor the reader of the essay , but the discussion drifted , as it often did , in the direction of Woman Suffrage , and John Weiss delivered himself of the following sentence : " When man and woman shall meet at the polls , and he shall hold out his hand and say to her , Give me your quick intuition , and accept in return my ratiocination " - A ringing laugh here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Emerson had a brief connection with the Radical Club ; and this may be a suitable place in which to give my personal impressions of the Prophet of New England . In recalling Mr. Emerson , we should analyze his works sufficiently to be able to distinguish the things in which he really was a leader and a teacher from other traits peculiar to himself , and interesting as elements of his historic character , but not as features of the ideal which we are to follow . Mr. Emerson objected strongly to newspaper reports of the sittings of the Radical Club . The reports sent to the New York Tribune by Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton were eagerly sought and read in very distant parts of the country . I rejoiced in this . It seemed to me that the uses of the club were thus greatly multiplied and extended . It became an agercy in the church universal . Mr. Emerson 's principal objection to the reports was that they interfered with the freedom of the occasion .

I remember hearing Mr. Emerson , in his discourse on Henry Thoreau , relate that the latter had once determined to . // manufacture the best lead pencil that could possibly be made . When he attained his end , parties interested at once besought him to place this excellent article on the market . He said : " Why should I do this ? I have shown that I am able to produce the best pencil that can be made . This was all that I cared to do . " The selfishness and egotism of this point of view did not appear to have entered into Mr. Emerson 's thoughts . Upon this principle , which of the great discoverers or inventors would have become a benefactor to the human race ? Theodore Parker once said to me , " I do not consider Emerson a philosopher , but a poet lacking the accomplishment of rhyme . " This may not be altogether true , but at least it is worth remembering . There is something of the seer in Mr. Emerson . The deep intuitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of his illustrations , - all these belong rather to the domain of poetry than to that of philosophy . The high level of thought upon which hc lived and moved and the wonderful harmony of his sympathies are his great lesson to the world at large . In spite of his rather defective sense of rhythm , his poems are divine snatches of melody . I think that , in the popular affection , they may outlast his prose . I was once surprised , in hearing Mr. Emerson talk , to find how extensively read he was in what we may term secondary literature . Although a graduate of Harvard , his reading of foreign literatures , ancient and modern , was mostly in translations . I should say that his intellectual pasture ground had been largely within the domain of belles-lettres proper . He was a man of angelic nature , pure , exquisite , just , refined , and human .

In the great victory of his day , the triumph of freedom over slavery , he has a record not to be outdone and never to be forgotten . A lesser light of this time was the Rev. Samuel Longfellow . I remember him first as of a somewhat vague and vanishing personality , not much noticed when his admired brother was of the company . This was before the beginning of his professional career . A little later , I heard of his ordination as aUnita*. nan minister from Rev. Edward Everett Hale , who had attended , and possibly taken part in , the services . The poet Longfellow had written a lovely hymn for the occasion . Mr. Hale spoke of " Sam Longfellow " as a valued friend , and remarked upon the modesty and sweetness of his disposition . " I saw him the other day , " said Mr. Hale . " He showed me a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which he had just purchased .

After the service , I invited him to take a Sunday dinner with Pr . Howe and me . He consented , and I remember that , in the course of our conversation , he said : " Theodore Parker has made things easier for us young ministers . He has demolished so much which it was necessary to remove . " The collection entitled Hymns of the Spirit , and published under the joint names of Samuel Longfellow and Samuel Johnson , is a valuable one , and the hymns which Mr. Longfellow himself contributed to the repertoire of the denomination are deeply religious in tone ; and yet I must think that among Unitarians of thirty or more years ago he was held to be something of a skeptic .
