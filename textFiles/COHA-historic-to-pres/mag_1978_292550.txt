" Death is something I look forward to " <P> The Rev. Jim Jones exhorted his followers over a loudspeaker in July to write him letters analyzing their attitudes toward elitism , anarchy , capitalism , socialism and their feelings about sex , authority and death . More than 200 of the letters-including one written on a scrap of cardboard from a milk carton-were found last week in a box on the porch of his cabin at Jonestown . They offer moving insights into the adherents ' obsessive loyalty to their leader , whom they addressed as " Dad , " and reveal minds bent upon self-abasement and sometimes self-destruction . The excerpts that follow use the spelling and punctuation of the original letters : <P> <P> I have to children now . They both mean so much to me . I want to give them security , but I also know I need them to be a security for me . I know I needed someone to share my life with because it seemed to be so lonely at times . Its the fault of too selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be a most honorable death because dying for Peace Justice , Freedom for all is worth the struggle . <P> C. Wilhite <P> <P> I do n't respect Dad the way I should . I respect Dad out of fear of getting in trouble . Rather than respecting him for what he is , a Marxist Lenist . When I 'm in a follower role and not in a supervisoral role , I feel threatened that people are against me which is n't true and comes back to my elitetism . <P> Eugene Smith <P> One of my biggest problems I feel is my inability to cope with rejection . I wanted to make it in society so I could completely make myself over so that some guy would want to marry and I would get the love and attention I felt needed . This type of sick attitude makes me dangerous to socialism because I could be too easily used by any male I felt attracted to . <P> Evelyn Thomas <P> <P> I fell gillty becuase i had money in the state and i did not turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think i am a eleist elitist . <P> Kecia Daisy , age 11 <P> <P> I waisted money buying cars and trucks , and I waisted money buying candy and soda pop , hamburgers , clothing that I did n't need . And I waist money buying gasoline and oil , waist money paying telephone bills , now Dad after hearing your teaching about how the tax off these above itms help to keep our sisters and brothers in slavement I feel very guilty . Oh yes , I bought beear , whisky , cigars , cigarettes by the carton and I feel guilt . <P> Gabriel Thomas <P> <P> I know I still follow you because you have the gift to protect me . I like to look strong but I know I 'm weak . <P> Shirley Smith <P> <P> It seems like when ever I have a good thought on my mind it usually boils down to having sex . Im attracked to brothers , sisters and even some children . Sexually , I feel this is very bad . Dad all I can say is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very humble and innocent persons , and the other one is a crull and insinceitive person that goes around with bad thoughts on his mind . <P> Preston Wade
