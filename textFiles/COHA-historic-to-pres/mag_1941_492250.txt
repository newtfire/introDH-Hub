. tire back at the Italian ships , as it were , from my own back yard . 1 fancy that the senior admiral who was at the head of the delegation though ( this levity misplaced , for he interrupted to say that I was well known to be a friend of France , that France and Great Britain were united in an indissoluble alliance , and that it was inconceivable to him that I should seek to hinder a plan which was of urgent necessity for the safety of the state . I broke in to say that any discussion was entirely unnecessary , because I was only too glad to let the state have whatever piece of land was required and in whatever situation . A murmur of approval issued from those six throats and both the senior admiral and the first spokesman , who was a gunnery expert , expressed their appreciation of my patriotism . To this they added a few well-chosen words about the public spirit so invariably shown by my compatriots . The demeanor of my visitors , which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not help hearing one bearded officer tell another what a . fine fellow I was , and how much it was to be wished that the French were so pleasant to deal with in matters of this sort . Then we went hack to business . An ollieer who had not yet spoken now made me a longish speech in the well-turned phrases which come so easily to a cultivated Frenchman 's lips . He pointed out that the value of land on the Riviera had diminished in recent years , and in case of war it would fall still more , that the piece of land they wanted was of no value to me , that they needed only so many meters by so many meters , and when the work was completed , I should n't even know it was there . Meanwhile six pairs of eyes watched me closely . At last the speaker asked me outright what I wanted for this worthless , insignificant , useless bit of property . " Nothing , " I said . I never saw such consternation blanch the faces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no objection to our putting a gun emplacement on your property . " " I have no objection . I shall he very glad to let you have the piece of land you want for nothing . " " We are quite prepared to pay a reasonablA price . " " I 'm sure you are , " I answered , " but I have lived many years in this country and have received many favors from the French people ; I could n't think of // asking you to pay for a little strip of land that you need for the defense of the country . " There was a silence . Though their eyes were fixed on me , I caught a surreptitious glance passing from one to the other , The atmosphere , which had been genial , quite noticeably grew chilly . Then someone said , " Of course we greatly appreciate your generosity . " The admiral hesitated a moment and then rose to his feet . " I will certainly inform the minister of your public-spirited offer , We will let you know in due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me very politely and filed out . Two days later I received from Toulon a stiff official letter thanking me for the courtesy with which I had received the delegation and stating that on mature consideration it had been decided not to place a gun on my property . I had been spending a few weeks in London and did not get back home till the middle of July , 1939 . I brought my nephew down with me ; my daughter and my son-in-law were to arrive in a fortnight . Friends of theirs and friends of mine were coming to stay and I expected the house to be filled with a succession of visitors till late in September . Then I $ intended to go back to London for a month before starting for India , where I meant to spend the winter . I had spent a winter there two years before and had found in that wonderful country much to Excite my imagination , and I was eager to go back . I think we all enjoyed ourselves . The life we led was simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an early riser and have my breakfast at eight , but the rest of the party sauntered downstairs at all hours in their pajamas and dressing gowns . At about eleven we drove down to Villefranche , where the yacht was moored , and went round to a little bay where we bathed and lay in the sun till we were as hungry as wolves . We had brought some food with us , but Costanzo , the Italian sailor , cooked us a great dish of macaroni to take the edge off our appetite . We drank the light red wine called tin rose , which I got by the barrel from a place away back in the hills . Then we dawdled and slept till we could bathe again , and after tea went back to the house to play tennis . We dined on the terrace among the orange trees , and when the moon was full over the sea , sowing her brilliance on the calm water in a great highway of white light , the scene was so lovely it took your breath away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the laughter , you heard the vociferous croaking of hundreds of little green frogs in the lily ponds down in the garden . After dinner , Liza and Vincent and their friends touk the car and drove in to Monte Carlo to dance . Of course , we talked a good deal about the possibility of war ; it seemed remote . A French friend of mine came down from Paris for a few days : he was a banker ; he had business dealings with Germany and he was in close touch with the Quai d'Orsay . He told us that the businessmen in Germany were strongly in favor of peace , war would be ruinous to them . After all , there had been a scare in September , 193E ; France had mobilized and war had n't come . There had been another scare in March , 1939 ; France had again mobilized and war had been averted . He assured us that the same thing would happen this time , and we were only too ready to believe him . By this time , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want war ; if we had been firmer at Munich , he would have yielded ; if the British and French governments had made a stand when he marched into Prague , he would have retreated . He had bluffed us twice , but now we were going to call his bluff . And when he saw that we were resolute , he would give way as he would have given way before . As a proof of his confidence . my friend told us that he had just bought a large block of shares in a Polish oil company . He went away ; another guest came to occupy his room . We continued to bathe and play tennis : the weather remained fine ; the new moon appeared one evening when it was hardly yet dark , a pale sickle of light in a pale sky , and we bowed to it three times and three times turned the money in our pockets . The moon waxed . The peaceful days passed one after the other , and then they were over . I once saw a waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the plates crushed noisily to the floor ; things went wrong with just that unexpected and startling effect . It looked as though Hitler was going to carry his bluff through , and there was no doubt about it . we had got to call it . The radio brought us disquieting news ; the Paris Daily Mail , a day old , described the situation as critical , and the local paper , which was pro-Italian , was frantic . Then the mayor of my village of St. Jean called up to say that the order of mobilization would be posted next day . I came down to breakfast on the following morning , and the cook came into the dining room and told me that the kitchen maid , an Italian girl , had disappeared during the night with her belongings . My son-in-law , Vincent , was playing in the tennis tournament at Monte Carlo , and he went in to have an hour 's practice with the professional . Francesco , the footman , came in with a white face and said he wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AGREED that he and his wife should go . Then I Vincent came back from Monte Carlo . He told me that everyone was packing up to get out as quickly as possible . There was n't a place to be got on the Blue Train . The road was already crowded with cars packed with luggage ; I had told my guests that there was no immediate danger until the Senegalese , the black troops . appeared on the roads ; Vincent said he had seen them guarding the railway bridge at the entrance to Cap Ferrat . They must have been brought in trucks during the night . We decided that he and Liza had better go , and he went up to pack . I went down to the garage to have his car lilted with gas , and my chauffeur told me that his class teas called up and he had to leave to rejoin his regiment next day . It was noon by now and the gardeners were trooping in for their midday meal . Francois , the head gardener , was a middle-aged man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not affected by the mobilizationi but one of the under gardeners  --  the three others were Italians had lo go . He was worried because he did riot know how his wife was to live on the eight francs a day which was all the government gave to soldiers ' wives . I told him I would give the girl enough to carry on with , and sent him away happy to cal his bread and sausage . When I got back to the house I found that Gerald , my friend and secretary , was come hack from Villefranche . He said there was great activity at the port . The Chasseurs Alpina , those brave , sturdy little men who can march , in their sloppy , rapid way , forty miles a day , had set out at dawn for the frontier , and a regiment of Senegalese had taken their place . The harbor master had told him that an order had come through from Toulon that all private yachts were to leave the harbor within twenty-four hours . We decided to take the Sara to Cassia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which we could lie in safety . In the agitation of the morning it had slipped my memory that I had asked some people to luncheon  --  a young English writer and his wife who were staying at a hotel at St. Jean . They suddenly arrived , very gay and debonair ; they were enjoying their holiday and had not read ( Continued on Page 1251 // meanin ' of that wagon yonder under the biR oak , jam against our front room ?

It was his wife 's collie . He mov-ing Mary off of someliody eke ' - propa paper for days . They had seen the Senegalese on the road and thought they looked very picturesque . When I told them that war might break out any minute , they would not believe me . It was just a scare , like the two preceding ones , and what fools they would ' feel if they went back to London , losing the rest of that lovely bathing , and nothing happened . I pointed out , somewhat tartly , that they would feel far bigger fools if their car was requisitioned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves unable to leave for weeks . An hour later , my house , which had been so lively . was deserted . Gerald and I went into Nice to stock up with provisions . There had been a run on the shop and there was not much lift . but we were able to get a dozen tins of sardines and a sufficient supply of canned soup , corned beef , tongue and sliced ham to last at least a couple of weeks . We bought several packets of macaroni and rice and a sack of potatoes . All this we stowed away on the boat . When we got back to the house we found that Ernest , my butler , a Swiss , had been to Nice on his motor bicycle to see his consul , who had told him that Switzerland was mobilizing and he would receive , shortly , his instructions to return . The chauffeur was leaving the following morning , after taking us down to Villefranche to embark . The cook and my remaining maid were in tears . They were both Italians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . They had been with me for many years and had nowhere to go , so they preferred to stay , but they were frightened , for my head gardener was very anti-Italian and had announced that he was going to cut the throat of every Italian on the place as won as my back was turned . I seem to have mentioned a great many servants , but the house was a large one and servants in France work ess nerd than servants in America , ind they do things which , in England , - ley would never consent to do .

The wagon wheels creaked a little as they turned slowly in the deep ruts , echoing in the stillness of the night . Tom Jeff walked along by Dolly for a while , to lighten the old gal 's load . When he finally climbed over the front wheel to the wagon seat , the Bantie Woman stirred in the foot of the wagon where she was crouched . lie made her ride on the wagon sea t with him .

Wages are moderate . I think I paid higher wages than any of my neighbors , and I paid my butler at the ordinary rate of exchange- twenty-five dollars a month , and the footman twenty . I had discovered long ago that the only way to live in a foreign country with comfort is to resign yourself to paying a little more for everything than a native and to submit to a reasonable degree of robbery with a shrug of the shoulders . in France , your cook has a tacit right to charge you 5 per cent more for everything she buys in the market than she has paid fur it , and if she does no more than double that , you must consider yourself the happy employer of an honest woman .

I could not discharge them or they would starve . have talked rather grandly of the yacht , but she was n't grand at all . The Sara was an old fishing boat of forty-five tons , with two masts , into which we had , a little time before , put a Diesel auxiliary . The crew consisted of Costanza , a sailor from Capri , a friend of his , named Giuseppe. from the same island , and a French cabin boy who had been one of my gardeners , but who had been discharged because he would never do any work . He did n't do any work on the Sara either , but he was civil , obliging and picturesque . I do n't know if you have noticed that the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be 250,000 of them between Ventimiglia , the Italian frontier , and Marseille . The French did not like them and resented their presence . But they were better workers than the French . People who employed them found them loyal , easy to get on with , and industrious . They flocked into France because work was hard to get in Italy , and badly paid . One thing the totalitarian states have never done , notwithstanding their high-flown promises , is to increase the welfare of the workingman . It was a lovely day with very little wind , and sunny , when we started off , so , as soon as we got out of the harbor , I put on my bathing trunks and lay in the sun . I was enjoying the quiet after those harassing days . I did n't quite know what would happen to my house . I had no fear that the Italians would succeed in breaking through the French fortifications ; they were very strong and on our way down to Villefranrhe that morning we had passed truckloads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the French army was invincible , and Jean , my chauffeur , had remarked that they would he to Rome in six weeks . The Toll of Mars I presumed that the French would bring down a good many troops as the mobilization proceeded . and it was quite possible that they would requisition my house . I knew from the lust war that when the military , officers or men , occupy a house , a lot of damage is done . Not only do they take anything that catches their fancy , Jut they are apt to do wanton harm . One of their favorite amusements is to fire their revolvers at the pictures . An acquaintance of mine who had a chateau sixty miles from I %vie had it destroyed during the last war , and when he rebuilt it he placed over the entrance a plaque on which was inscribed ; ' ' This chit eau was bombarded by the Germans , looted by the French and burnt by the English . " But I was disinclined for gloomy thoughts , and as 80011 : LS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had a swim in deep water . We were in no great hurry , vivre we did not propose to go farther that day than Ste. Maxime , where I had friends , and with whom , if they were still f here , we hoped to dine . I read and slept and smoked . There was a feeling of gentle excitement at the notion of taking the boat out of the danger zone . The Stars and Stripes floating from her stern insured her safety . We reached Ste. Maxime toward evening and dropped anchor just opposite my friend 's house , got into the dinghy and rowed to the landing stage . My friend was the proprietor and editor of a weekly paper with a great circulation , and we expected to get from him reliable and late news of the crisis . We only just caught him  --  the car was already at the door for he and his wife were starting for Paris and they were finishing their packing . But when we arrived , they decided to give us dinner and set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man with a bald head , a fat , round , clean-shaven face , in which his fine dark eyes flashed intelligently , and a fat , goodhumored , cynical laugh . He never took any exercise except to shoot at a bottle in the water with his revolver , and he had a flabby , fat body . He had been a deputy , but his election had cost him so much-3,000,000 francs , well over $100,000 ? that when the next elections came , he did not stand . An attempt had been made to unseat him for bribery and corruption , but by the wit and humor with which he met the charges brought against him he bad jockeyed the house into confirming his election . He had married a woman with a large fortune , and on her money had started this paper , which , in a very short time , achieved a huge success , He was an unscrupulous but brilliant editor . The literary and artistic sec-teals were very well written . He published excellent translations of my novels and stories . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was due to his intemperate , savage and personal attacks on Freemasons , Jews , Communists , Socialists and radicals . He had a violence that was truly Corsican ; he never forgave an enemy , hut , on the other hand , he was a loyal and devoted friend . I have known him intimately for twenty years and have never known him hesitate to do his best if I wanted help either for myself or anyone else . He was generous , and if ever 1 had been in need of money I am convinced that he would have put almost any sum at my disposal , and his hospitality was lavish . He had a cynical effrontery which I could not but find fascinating . At the time of the sanctions he adopted a policy which was violently pro-Italian ; his enemies said that he was receiving large sums for this from the Italian government , and I have now little doubt that it was true . I hesitated at that time to believe it , be cause his paper was making so much money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe now I was wrong , I am still inclined to think that he accepted Italian subsidies  --  and probably insisted that they should be large  --  to support a policy he honestly believed in . It would have appealed to his sense of humor to be well paid for doing what he would have done for nothing . In the course of his campaign he attacked England ferociously  --  so ferociously that my government thought fit to protest to the French government . It occurred to him  --  quite rightly  --  that I might take offense at these articles , so he sent me a message to the effect that I was not to be disgruntled . it was only politics , and as soon as things calmed down he would have another article written saying that Great Britain was grand and the English the finest fellows in the world . On one occasion a minister of the government was driven to commit suicide by his vitriolic attacks . This caused a reaction on the part of the public and there was general indignation against my friend 's conduct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with characteristic coolness . " It 's not playing the game to commit suicide , " he told me with his fat , infectious laugh . " It 's taking an unfair advantage in a political controversy . " " Has it affected your circulation ? " I asked . " Just for a week or two , " he answered , with a shrug of his shoulders ; then , with a twinkle in his tine eyes , " I 'm starting a first-rate serial next week , and that 'll put us up again . " He was a gangster who had the gangster 's code of honor and the gangster 's courage . In the last war he was an airman . When he was in the Chamber of Deputies he had fought a duel and , being the good shot he was , had wounded his adversary in the arm , as he had said beforehand he meant to do . He was very funny at the expense of his fellow deputies , who from then on overwhelmed him with their timorous , deference . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister of the Interior ordered his arrest , whereupon he called him up and told him where he was to be found , adding that he had twelve of his Corsican friends with him , all armed , and he would resist arrest . No one came . I should add , to complete my description of this strange man , that he was a faithful churchman , an affectionate and intelligent father , a considerate husband and a dutiful son . I think he looked upon all standards of virtue as flummery , which made it easier for a clever man to deal with fools . He had so identified himself with his wretched paper that its success was his personal success , too ; his one aim was to get on , and to do this he was prepared to stick/ at nothing . He liked the power his paper gave him and he got a malicious pleasure out of the flatteries people paid him to his face , when he knew that behind his back they had n't a good word to say for him . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raconteur of droll , bitter stories . I expect to live to see the day when he will he put against a prison wall one cold morning and shot by a firing squad . I ask myself whether , if he appealed to me to save him in such a case , I would do so . I am convinced that if I were in a similar position , he would move heaven and earth to get the out of it . Scraps of Paper The thought of war exasperated him , and that Great Britain and France should resort to it on account of Poland seemed to him perfectly absurd . " Why should we care about Poland ? " he asked . " The Poles have always been worthless people , and the Russians would have beaten them years ago if the French had not had the idiotic notion of sending Weygand tee get them out of the mess they had got themselves into . " I reminded him that we had contracted to help them . " What is a contract ? " he asked . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to affirm that , at the time of signing , it is to their mutual interest , so long as the conditions are the same , to adhere to certain clauses . " We left early because the wind was freshening and we wanted to take the boat to a safer anchorage than the open roadstead in which site lay . We spent the night in the little harbor of Ste. Maxime and next day at dawn set out again on our journey . At intervals I went on deck to have a smoke and a chat with Costanzo , who was at the tiller . He was between thirty-five and forty , a little man , but very wiry , with a flat , deeply wrinkled face , a large mouth and shrewd , twinkling eyes . He had sailed the Mediterranean all his life and knew all its fickle moods and all its guile . He was a man of few words , but of a wonderful eloquence of gesture ; with a bend of the head , a twitch of the shoulder , a turn of the elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conversation , lucid , sensibl4 and humorous , which was as plain as any that most men express with words . asked him what he was proposing to do if Italy entered the war . ( Condnurd on Parr 128 ) ( Continued from Page 126 ) " Nothing , " he said silently . " But if she does , you 'll be interned . " " What then ? " he motioned . He spoke , " I 'd rather be interned in France than fight in Italy . " " You do n't want to fight ? " " Who wants to fight ? Not the Italians . " " You do n't much like the Germans , do you ? " I asked . " Pigs , " he answered . The dawn brought no abatement in the wind . Even the captain of an Atlantic liner , who wo n't acknowledge that it 's more than half a gale when his huge vessel is bobbing about like a cork , would have been obliged to admit that it was dirty weather ; green seas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was movable was being tossed about . One was safe enough . but no one could say it was comfortable , and we decided to run for shelter . We examined the chart and found what looked like a little bay in the lee of the wind . We plowed through the angry sea for three or four hours more and then , turning a rugged , rocky cape , found ourselves in water as flat as a pond . The cove was surrounded by-green hills , on the top of one of which was a small fortress which was part of the defenses of Toulon . It would have been hard to find a more beautiful and a more sequestered spot . It was enchanting to lounge away the day there , sleeping- for we had none of us had much sleep the night before- bathing . playing patience and reading . Our meals had been scrappy while we were battling with the storm , and it was very good to have a great plate of spaghetti for luncheon and a plate of soup and fresh fish for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers might have fled who wanted to hide their love from the world . No one would have thought of looking for them there . Peace . I never knew a place in which it seemed so much a part of the air you breathed . At night the silence was so intense that , except for the restless searchlight of the fort , you might have conceived yourself alone in the immaterial world of abstract thought . Before the Storm But we had to pass by Toulon , and if war was declared before we got by , it was possible that we should be turned back , so , early on the third morning , we set off again . We came in sight of Toulon , keeping well out for fear of mines , and a boat hurried out to have a look at us , but apparently the Stars and Stripes reassured them and they chugged away without a hail . We knew that the secluded creeks we were looking for were beyond Cassis , but that was all we knew , and the chart showed several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer safe anchorage . We could see them through the glasses , little seaside resorts that looked gay and friendly , and the Mediterranean Pilot , indispensable to all people who have n't the sense to stay on dry land , stated that Bandol had a good harbor . The yacht would be as safe as in any creek beyond Cassis , and when we came abreast of it I proposed that we should make for it . My companion and Costanzo gave me to understand that seamen like themselves liked to bump about in a stormy sea , and they repeated that the good old boat could stand far worse than that . Had n't she twice crossed the Atlantic ? If she had , it must have been a hell of a journey , but though I had often told visitors the same thing myself , I never quite believed it . But they accepted my suggestion with more alacrity than I had anticipated . In the harbor we found so many sailing boats and motorboats anchored that we had difficulty in finding a vacant berth . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort , but not a smart one like Cannes or Antibes , nor a gay one like St. Tropez , where the artistic young-and the not so young-English and American , go in summer to dress themselves in gay colors , wear enormous hats and sit about to all hours in stuffy night clubs under the harmless delusion that they are being Bohemian . Bandol is neither fashionable nor artistic , and so far as I could hear , the only person of notoriety that lived there was Mistinguette . The barber told me. with pride , that her legs were insured for a million francs . Here , then , we settled down to await events . The papers , the radio , described the situation as perilous . Before leaving England I had spoken with one or two influential persons about the possibility of my making myself useful if war broke out . During the last one I had been in the Intelligence Service until the tuberculosis I had contracted in Switzerland from exposure had been so aggravated by want of nourishment in Russia that I was no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanatorium in the north of Scotland . I had had a good deal of experience and hoped that use might be made of it . As a second string , I had put myself in touch with the Ministry of Information . I made up my mind to get hack to England as soon as it was possible to travel ; for the moment , all trains were being used to move troops and the ordinary services were suspended . The days passed . I got up early in the morning and went ashore , across the esplanade , to buy the paper ; the cabin boy , whose name was Jo , brought a fresh loaf of bread from the baker 's and I had my cafe as ' ail ; then I smoked my pipe and shaved and washed , after which it was time to go to market . We had made up our minds to hoard our canned goods , and so bought all the fresh provisions we could . The market was held in a square . The farmers ' wives stood behind the stands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheeses , which they had brought in that morning . The display of fruit-grapes , peaches , melons , figs , greengages , apricots and pears- was a sight so gay and rich that it made you happy to look at it . The summer visitors had fled with a rush and prices had fallen sharply , but you still had to keep your wits about you . When one good woman assured me that she would never sell a cheese to an Englishman and an ally , and therefore entitled to the best , which she could n't guarantee on her word of honor was a perfect cheese , and I discovered it was moldy ; when another good woman sold me a melon which was as hard as a rock , after vowing on the head of her mother that I should come hack next day and tell her I had never eaten a better one in my life , my faith in human nature was shaken . But I learned . Fresh eggs were scarce , and you had to buy two or three here and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his shop was crowded so that you had to wait your turn . There was little beef - that , it appeared , was reserved for the military , for they could eat nothing else-but there was plenty of mutton and pork . Costanzo would not eat mutton , which he described as offal , so that when I I bought that because it was all I could get , he would put on a martyred expression and say that bread and cheese was quite good enough for the likes of him . I bought chickens with trepidation , because I could never tell if that dead , featherless creature was young and tender or old and tough ; I tried to pretend I knew what I was doing by poking a timid finger into its breast , but the cold and clammy skin gave me gooseflesh . The English papers were four or five days old , but I read them anxiously . Great Britain was getting ready to fight . At noon the Marseille station gave the latest news . Things were looking black , but the Germans had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was cocktail time . The Sara 's refrigerator had never worked very well , and we should have been in a predicament if there had n't been an iceman who came round every morning and provided us with a big lump of ice . After that , lunch on deck under the awning and then a nap . When I woke I took the dinghy and rowed out to the mouth of the harbor to have a bathe in clean water . The Curtain Rises I was ready for a cup of tea when I came back , and then I strolled about watching the men play honk . There were ten or a dozen matches being played on the esplanade , and the players of reputation would be surrounded by a group of spectators . The stakes were generally a round of drinks . They played with grim concentration , freely giving one another advice , and it would never have occurred to you that the country was on the verge of a terrible disaster . Presently someone would he seen with a paper , and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet from Marseille before all copies were sold . The radio news came at seven . Dinner on deck in the balmy night was delicious . On the boats moored on either side of the Sara people were dining , too , and the light that hung from the boom cut a charming little intimate picture out of the darkness . After dinner I played patience , then took a detective story to bed and finished it before I went to sleep . I think we must have been in Bandol nearly a week when Gerald , who had been ashore on some errand , came on hoard and told me that the Germans had marched into Poland . I was sunbathing on deck while I read the Daily Telegraph . " Good , " I said . " No , bad , " he answered . " It means war . " " I know . " It was a relief , after those anxious days of waiting , to have the matter decided . Of course I knew that the war would be terrible . I knew that cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the countries engaged would be ruined , but I believed in the French army and the British fleet . I thought the Allies would in all probability win , but , in any case , could not be beaten . I went to the post office to send a telegram to remind the person to whom I had spoken that I was ready to do anything , however modest , that could be found for me . I was told that tel . grams must be censored by the mayo and that , in any case , private messag were subject to unspecified delay .
