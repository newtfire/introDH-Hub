 | " You 're late , " she said . " I know , I 'm sorry , we 'll have to find a new place . " " Why ? " He nodded toward MacLoon 's table . " Certain politicians have a way of casting a pall over even the best restaurants . " A waiter delivered a bottle of New York champagne in a bucket , opened it and poured some into each of their glasses . Clarence sniffed his , took a sip , and launched into a change of pace . " Lydia , my advice to you is never offer a cup of coffee to a policeman when he 's questioning you about a murder , and especially when his nine-year-old daughter is taking piano lessons . When he found out about me he insisted on discussing music and whether his daughter 's teacher is taking the right approach . " " Did he ever get around to asking you about the murder ? " " Eventually . Wanted to know whether I had any animosity toward Caldwell , whether we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friends . As though I 'd admit to any of that if I 'd killed him . " " Did he tell you anything ? " " No , except that his daughter wo n't practice her scales . Well , what did you think of Hughes 's interview with Veron-ica ? " " Mixed feelings . How about you ? " " I only saw bits of it because he would n't stop talking . From what I heard I 'd say the lady is n't wasting much of her widowhood . " " Which , I think , is to be admired . You did hear about her appointment to fill out Cale 's term in the Senate ? " " Yes , and about the foundation in his name . Let me ask you something , Lydia , and promise you wo n't have my head for it ? " " I promise nothing .

" See , no temper . The answer , of course , is no . " " Well , I do n't think it 's so far-out . After all , there were those who speculated that Lyndon Johnson might have had something to do with Kennedy 's death in order to become Presi-dent ? " " Some people  --  I 'm not one of them . " " What are you having ? " he asked , changing gears again . " Eggs Benedict and a rasher of bacon . You ? " " Venison , fried egg on the side , over easy . " He gave their order , then recounted for Lydia the details of his interrogation by the MPD detective . When he was finished and their food had been served , Lydia brought up Veronica 's suggestion that she accept a post as special counsel to a Senate committee to investigate Cale Caldwell 's murder . Clarence listened , commenting only by raising his salt-and-pepper eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer and the circumstances surrounding it at the Caldwell house , he cleared his throat and said , " It depends entirely if you want to make a name for yourself . If so , by all means do it . If you value your sanity , for God 's sake turn it down  --  and do it fast and mean it . Lydia said nothing for a minute , then , " I have no interest in making a name for myself as special counsel to a committee to investigate the murder of a friend . But what do you do when his widow  --  who is also a friend  --  asks ? Just walk away ? " " Exactly . Besides , what would you do with your private practice if you took it ? " " Leave it up to my associates , try to keep a handle on things from a distance . What 's wrong with that ? " " Everything . As Louis Armstrong said when someone asked him what was wrong with a friend who 'd suddenly died , When you 're dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting cold . " " They already are . " She placed her fork on her plate . " I love you dearly , Clarence , and have always had a big fat respect for your opinions , but there are times when I find you to be a trying ass . "  | He sat back , grinned . " And this obviously is one of those times . Sorry . It 's my way of concealing unacceptable levels of anxiety about you . I can understand how you feel and why you 're seriously considering Veronica 's proposal . Personally I think it would be a mistake and that you 'll end up regretting it . On the other hand if you do n't do it you 'll probably spend the rest of your days wondering if you should have . So take it if it 's really offered . " " If I do , will you stand by me ? " He laughed . " Of course not . After all , I 'm a prime suspect , and how would it look for the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , shut up . . " He did , but her mind would n't . Without quite meaning to , she was already beginning to think as though she 'd taken the job .  | THE GOOD weather of fall had given way to the harsher climate of early winter . It had rained heavily over the weekend . Now , at ten o'clock on Monday morning Lydia sat in a green vinyl armchair in the drab office of deputy chief of police of Washington 's Metropolitan Police Department , Horace Jenkins . She 'd been told to wait ; Chief Jenkins had been called away from his desk for a few minutes . " Hello , Lydia , " he said as he came through the door . " Nature called . " His voice startled her and she turned abruptly . He walked past her , fell heavily into his green vinyl chair behind the desk and grinned . " How are you ? " she asked . " Terrific , " he said , yawning . " I woke up alive this morning , still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within striking distance . How are you ? " " Fair . " " Special counsel , huh ? " " Yes . . . I was flattered to be asked . " " Sure you were . " He rubbed his baggy eyes , yawned again . Lydia had once commented to a friend that Jenkins looked like Walter Matthau after a bad night . Sitting across from him she realized how apt her description had been . He was in shirtsleeves , suit jacket a rumpled heap on top of a file cabinet . He had a full head of black hair that had n't receded even in his latter stages of middle age . Flesh hung in folds from his jawbone , cheeks and neck . His eyes were ' large and watery , evoking all the pathos of a hound that had n't been fed in days . He was a big man who tended to excessive weight , although his large frame carried poundage rather well . " So tell me , Lydia , what 's a nice girl like you doing in a place like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope . Besides , I 'm not so nice , and you know it . I 'm also no longer a girl . " " By me you 're still a girl , and I wo n't forget how you stood up there in court and defended those bananas . And , damn it , you are nice , if not easy . . . anyway , how 's the radio and TV business-4 " " Okay , Horace , let 's cool the chitchat . Here I am as scheduled . I assume your invitation has something to do with the Caldwell murder . " " Yeah , well , I figured I 'd spare you going through this routine with some of the idiots who work for me , or over me . " He leaned forward , which caused his chair to let out a shrill squeak , leaned on his elbows . " I 'm sure you realize this is awkward . . . here I am interrogating you about the senator 's murder while you act as special counsel to a committee investigating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides I was at the party and so theoretically I could be a suspect  --  but you and I are going to have to work very closely , Horace . After all , we 're after the same thing . " He grunted and answered his intercom . " No , damn it , that 's not what I said I wanted . " A pause . " Then do it over . Do n't bother me , I 'm wrapping up the Caldwell murder . " There was a hint of mirth in his eyes as he looked across the desk at her . " You were saying ? " " That I assume we 'll be working closely together on the Caldwell case . " " No , we wo n't . The last thing I need is to have a Senate committee getting in my way . Caldwell 's murder , senator or not , is an MPD matter and it 's going to stay that way . " " I did n't realize you controlled the Senate . " " I 'm a cop , Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . I do n't know what the hell you people think you 're going to accomplish over there with another damn committee at taxpayer expense . This case is simple . Caldwell has a party thrown for him by his wife . She invites a coupla hundred snowflakes and one of them gets carried away and sticks an ice pick into the guest of honor . . . Let me ask you a question . "  | " Go ahead . " " Did you kill him ? " " No . " " Right . Interrogation over . Take my advice , Lydia , go back to getting licenses for radio stations and tell your Senate chums to get back to the business of running the country , not running over it . " " I 'll be sure to carry back your sentiments , especially to the committee that funds the District of Columbia . I 'll also remind you , chief , that the committee is a fact of life . It exists , it 's real , and it 's been created to investigate Cale Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as necessary as a hind tit . Pardon me . " " You 're pardoned . I 'm no longer a little girl , like I told you ... well , if you 're through , I 'll be going . " " Sure . . . look , Lydia , believe it or not , I wish you well with this . I always admired you when you were doing criminal work . I just hate to see you get messed up in a no-win situa-tion ? " " I appreciate that . " She stood and extended her hand over the desk . He took it , clicked his tongue against his cheek . " If I was younger , Lydia , I 'd make a pass . " " Thank you , I 'm woman enough to like to hear that , even from an old party like you . " " Yeah , old party , well , good seeing you . By the way , do you know how I figure it ? " She stopped at the door . " How ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Have you interviewed him ? " " Sure . We told him to stay around town but he went back to his cult . I sent somebody down there to bring him up here and he starts screaming about freedom of religion and separation of church and state . " " And ? " " We left him there " " You must have felt he was n't that much of a suspect . " " As good as any , better than most . At this point , anyway . The way I figured it he 's less likely to skip out on his fellow freaks than from the city . "  | " Can I see the transcripts of the people you 've inter-viewed ? " Jenkins shook his head . " We 'll subpoena them , Horace . " " We 'll play the game an inning at a time , Lydia . . . You are looking good . Like I said , if I was younger I 'd ? " " Have a nice day , like they say . " " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her irritation until reaching the street , then drew a series of deep breaths and began muttering to herself . Years ago , when she 'd worked as a public defender , she 'd enjoyed the daily battle with the MPD . The truth was she 'd lost as often as she 'd won , but the challenge was always a highly exhilarating one . Now , instead of feeling challenged , she felt a deep , abrupt frustration . She 'd been out of that arena for a long time , comfortable , secure behind her desk from which she navigated the tricky waters of the FCC on behalf of clients who paid handsome fees for her knowledge and expertise . Any infighting was accomplished with padded gloves . In criminal matters there were no gloves . She 'd nearly forgotten that , and the realization sent a chill through her that a gusty north wind whipping up the street could not match . She pulled her coat collar tighter around her neck and walked briskly across town to her office , where she returned phone calls , dictated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Senator Wilfred MacLoon , who 'd been chosen to chair the Caldwell committee . The choice of MacLoon to chair the committee had disheartened Lydia , but she decided not to allow her feelings to interfere with her performance . She had , however , raised the question with Veronica Caldwell about whether it was a wise idea to have an avowed political enemy of her husband 's heading up a committee to investigate his murder . Veronica 's answer made sense . Because MacLoon and Caldwell were known to dislike each other , it could only add to the public 's confidence in the committee 's integrity . MacLoon would be under the gun to disprove any personal grudge , would be doubly aggressive in the investigation . At least that was the theory .  | Lydia was kept waiting in MacLoon 's outer office for fifteen minutes before an aide ushered her inside , where the senator was giving an interview to a young newspaper reporter . " With you in a minute , " he told Lydia , waving his hand . He said to the reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure the American public that the murder of Senator Caldwell was in no way connected with any government institution , nor did it have overtones or implications that in any way reflect on this nation 's governing bodies or those of its allies . Got that ? " " Yes , I think so . Thank you , senator . " MacLoon grinned broadly , stood and shook the reporter 's hand . " Anytime , my dear . The door is always open to you . " The reporter nodded at Lydia as she left the office . " Sorry to keep you waiting , " MacLoon said . " Sit down . " Lydia sat in an armchair next to his desk . " Is n't it a little premature to be giving interviews about the committee 's work ? " she asked . " I do n't think so . No sense in trying to play games with the press . I 'd like to see this committee be an open one that the press and public can have faith in . No stonewalling . Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . within reason . " She observed MacLoon as he swiveled his chair and began rummaging through a file drawer . She could hear his heavy breathing , the result of a lifetime of cigars and cigarettes and a paunch that threatened to burst through his belt . MacLoon was almost totally bald , and had a full face that was made to appear even more so because of a tight shirt collar that pressed into the flesh of his neck . He found what he was looking for , turned back to his desk and suppressed a belch as he opened a file folder and thumbed through its pages . " Senator MacLoon , I know you 're busy but so am I. I wonder if we could discuss the committee and my role on it . I assumed that was your purpose in asking me here . " " Yes , sure . Just give me a minute . " He frowned as he read a page from the folder , then called through the open door , " Margaret , in here . " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entered and MacLoon handed the  | page to her . " Copy it and get it out to Markovich right away . " Lydia fought down her impatience , cleared her throat . " I 'll come back when you have more time . " MacLoon looked up , appearing to be surprised . " Relax , we 'll get to it in a moment . How about lunch ? I 'll have it sent up ? " " No , thank you . Senator MacLoon , I accepted this committee post at the request of Veronica Caldwell . I have mixed feelings about it . On the one hand I 'm pleased to be able to contribute something to solving this tragedy . On the other , I have a pretty successful law practice that will suffer during my absence . I want to get on with my work on the committee . I want you to understand that . " He looked at her as though she were an errant daughter . " Miss James , let 's not get off on the wrong foot . Frankly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . As far as I was concerned , what we needed was an attorney with a clean sheet who 's used to working behind the scenes and fitting into a team that has a clear-cut game plan ? " " Why do men always use a sports metaphor ? " And in this case a mixed one . Before he could answer she added , " I just left Horace Jenkins at the MPD and he talked about playing an inning at a time . You talk about teams and game plans . I 'm sorry , but I do n't see this as a game . " " He squinted through the heavy , mottled flesh of his face . " No need to get testy , Miss James . We 're in this together , after all . " " Over your objections . " " That 's right . After Veronica did some talking I decided that having you on the team might not be such a bad idea after all . Your reputation is solid , no obvious skeletons in your closet , you 're close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts nonsense he was involved with . " Lydia shifted in her chair . " You might as well know , senator , that I do n't consider it nonsense . I 've been involved myself , which is how I got to be friends with Veronica Caldwell . " " Senator Veronica Caldwell , " he said . " That 's right . I also became friendly with your wife through the arts . "  | " The difference there , Miss James , is that my wife 's dabbling never influenced my Senate duties . " " Are you saying that Veronica Caldwell 's activities influenced her husband 's ? " " You know it . You might also be interested to hear that Senator Caldwell was about to get in some hot water over it . The arts section of the last Interior bill upset a lot of people around here . The same thing happened when he worked behind the scenes to kill a committee bill to investigate these damn cults and the brainwashing they use . That was one of the things that drove Jimmye McNab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure whether to admit her ignorance of what he was saying or to pretend some knowledge of it in the hope that it would encourage him to say more . She decided to say nothing . It did n't work . MacLoon looked at his watch . " Tell you what , Miss James , I have some things to do . I 'll have one of my people show you to the office we 've found for you . It 's not much but it 'll have to do . We 're cramped for space all over the building . " " I 'm sure it will be fine . What about staffing ? " " It 's in the budget . I 'll have someone fill you in completely . I 'd like to get started on this immediately so that we can get it over with . " " I 'll do all I can to see that it 's a thorough and efficient investigation . I 'm concerned about leaks to the press of the committee 's activities . I feel it 's vital we be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about those things later . " MacLoon unwrapped a cigar and chewed off its tip . " Hope you do n't mind working with a cigar smoker . " " Not at all . " He held a lit match close to the cigar 's blunt end and slowly , carefully inhaled . As his first exhalation of blue smoke curled easily toward the ceiling he said , without looking at her , " Let 's understand one thing right from the top , Miss James . This investigation in the Senate has nothing to do with solving Cale Caldwell 's murder . " " Pardon ? "  | He drew on the cigar again , stood and came to the edge of his desk , and leaned on it , his face close to hers . " Solving murders is for the MPD . This committee 's function is to assure the American people that the murder had nothing to do with their government . " She leaned away from him as she said , " I gathered that was your position from what I heard you tell the reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee 's functions . Now I take it you view public assurance as our only function . " " That 's right . " He perched on the edge of the desk . " I 'm afraid I do n't agree . " " " You will as it progresses . " She stood . " Thank you for your time , senator . I 'd like to see my office . " He told a young man who 'd been reading a newspaper in the outer office to escort Lydia and see that she had access to any supplies , furniture and staff help she needed . The young man , who introduced himself as Rick Petrone , and who told her he 'd been working for Senator MacLoon for over a year , led her down a long corridor and up a flight of stairs to an office which , Lydia instantly decided , had once been a large storage closet that had recently been cleaned out . A battered metal desk occupied the center of the room . Rings of dirt on the buff walls outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two small windows were caked with dirt , and what light they did allow to pass through had a yellowish-gray cast to it . " Just name it and it 's yours , " Petrone said . Lydia had taken an instant liking to him . He was tall and undeniably handsome , with a mop of brown hair that was appealingly unkempt . His smile was warm , genuine . He wore a brown plaid vested suit and tan knit tie . " I can think of a lot of things , " she said lightly , surprised and a little annoyed at her tone . He took a note pad and pen from his pocket . " Let 's make a list right now . " Twenty minutes later the list was completed . She thanked  | him for his courtesy and said she had to go back to her own offices for an appointment . " Just call on me anytime , Miss James , " he said . " I guess I 'd be less than candid with you if I did n't admit that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I graduated from law school last year and took this job with Senator MacLoon as a way to get a look at how government works . Do n't get me wrong . I 've enjoyed it , and it 's been interesting . But I 'd like to get back to something that 's a little closer to the law . I do n't want to be a pest but ? " " Maybe I can have you assigned to me for the duration of the investigation . I 'll suggest it to the senator , if you 'd like . " " I 'd really appreciate that , Miss James . I really would . " " All right , then consider it done . " They walked down the hall together . Lydia 's gait was considerably faster than it had been earlier in the day , and Petrone had to move quickly to keep up with her . It had occurred to her as she stood in the small , temporary office that she deserved to be treated exactly as she had been since becoming involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in awe of male authority . She 'd been suffering from an unjustifiable fear of leaving the genteel comfort and security of her law practice to once again enter the more combative arena of Congress and criminal law , and was ashamed of how wishy-washy it had made her . Her dead father had had a favorite saying ? " Drive it like you owned it , " and the warm memory of him and his insistence that she work for excellence in every phase of life filled her , at once , with guilt , and with determination to jump into this new and challenging role with all the vigor and dedication she could manage . " Remember what I said . " Petrone shook her hand . " You can call on me for anything . I just want to help in any way I can . " " Thank you , I appreciate it . " Very much , she added silently to herself . Petrone went back to MacLoon 's office , where he resumed reading his newspaper until the senator returned . " She squared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . We made a list of what she needs . " " What she really needs is a man , " MacLoon said . " You up to it ? " Petrone smiled . " I 'm always up for that . She intends to ask you to assign me to her for the duration of the investigation . " " I 'll put up a good argument against it but she can have you . Just make sure you stay close to her and keep me filled in on whatever the hell she 's up to . " " No problem there , senator . I just want to help in any way I can . "  | THE NEXT two weeks passed quickly for Lydia . Rick Petrone proved to be a most helpful and efficient young man , and Lydia 's office was transformed into a workable , comfortable one . Besides providing all the necessary furniture and supplies , Petrone ordered extra touches  --  fresh flowers , prints on the walls , a radio and a love seat on which Lydia spent more and more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she had had any illusions about being able to split her time between committee business and her own law practice , they were soon put down by the demands of her committee responsibilities . There was a daily meeting of the full committee ? six senators , aides from their offices and the staff Lydia had brought together , five people in all including Rick Petrone , one of Lydia 's associates from her law office and three people assigned by MacLoon , two secretaries and a researcher named Ginger Johnson . Lydia 's first reaction to Ginger had been less than enthusiastic . She seemed too young and flighty to provide the research Lydia was counting on . Short , tending to chubbiness , with long red hair that seemed always to be in search of a comb , Ginger had been introduced to Lydia by MacLoon as a former Time researcher , a graduate of the University of Missouri Journalism School and more recently employed by HUD in research . She did n't appear to be old enough to have gotten such experience and background , and Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ginger 's answers , plus an informal background check , verified everything MacLoon and Ginger had claimed . And as the second week wound down and Ginger 's efforts started to pile up , Lydia began to see her as a good tough questioner , at home with detail and not afraid to  | roll up her sleeves and make order out of the piles of material that soon took over nearly half the office . The Friday meeting at the end of the second week ran until six in the evening . It dealt mostly with routine matters until Lydia told of her decision to examine all the circumstances surrounding the unsolved murder of TV journalist Jimmye McNab . " Why ? " she was asked . " I think it 's applicable , " she answered . " And even if it proves not to be , we 'd be derelict not to at least look at it and evaluate its potential relevance to the Caldwell murder . . . " She did n't mention that her renewed interest in the McNab murder had been aroused by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voyeur . Ginger Johnson had routinely included the article in her research files and had mentioned it to Lydia , more as a joke , a light moment , than as a matter seriously to be considered . Lydia had laughed along with her researcher , but late the previous night she 'd settled down on the love seat in her office and read it , along with other materials Ginger had marked for her attention . The writer of the piece had , of course , sensationalized every aspect of both the McNab and Caldwell murders to suit the style of the publication , but as Lydia made her way through the florid prose and shaky cause-and-effect scenario concocted by the writer between the McNab and Caldwell murders , she realized , in spite of herself , that it was a reasonable proposition ... Two people had been murdered . Jimmye McNab , a TV journalist , had been raised by the other , Senator Caldwell , since infancy . Lydia had honestly agonized over suggesting that the McNab murder be included in the scope of the committee 's investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very personal wounds in the Caldwell family . But after a sleepless night she 'd come to the conclusion that at least a possible link between the deaths had to be acknowledged . Her suggestion caused some of the senators around the oval table to shift in their seats and look to Wilfred MacLoon . As chairman his chair had a higher back , and was at the table 's  | head . A cigar clenched between his teeth had gone out , and a heavy shadow of beard gave him a particularly dour look . He fixed Lydia in a hard stare . " I do n't see any need to extend the scope of this committee beyond Senator Caldwell 's death . " " I 'm not suggesting that either , " Lydia said . " Our charter charges us with investigating the circumstances surrounding Senator Caldwell 's murder . If there 's even a remote possibility that Jimmye McNab 's murder might , in some way , put some light on that effort , I do n't see how we can ignore it . " MacLoon leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , the McNab murder has nothing to do with us . " Lydia glanced at the others . Had MacLoon at least opened the issue for discussion , she would n't have been so upset . But his arbitrary dismissal of it . . . She pulled out of a file folder a copy of Public Law 66-Io7 under which the committee had been formed and funded . " I do n't want to belabor this , but our charter says that we are to ... " She read directly from the charter . " . . . examine every detail and aspect of the death of Senator Cale G. Caldwell , using all available resources , agencies and individuals who might have bearing upon said death , and to prepare and deliver a full , impartial and accurate report to the Congress of the United States and to the American people . " MacLoon abruptly sat up and rolled his stubby fingers on the table . " We 're all aware of what the charter says , Miss James . The fact is , which is not included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder is not Senate business . What you 're suggesting is to open up a whole can of worms that represents nothing but a waste of taxpayer money and , I might add , of our time . You do that , and when we start calling witnesses to testify , we 'll need the Kennedy Center to hold them . Forget about anything except what directly bears on the senator 's death . Is that clear enough ? " Lydia looked at Senator Jack Markowski , the youngest on the committee and the one she felt the most rapport with . A trace of a grin appeared on his lips , and he narrowed his eyes as though to tell her that she should press ahead with her idea . She looked at MacLoon . " As special counsel to this commit-  | tee , Senator MacLoon , I ca n't in conscience ignore an area of investigation that might bear on the outcome of our work . Maybe I 've prematurely introduced this line of inquiry . If so , I 'll develop more compelling reasons for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , a vote whether to include it in the full investigation would , it seems to me , be appropriate . " MacLoon looked as though he might explode . His face turned red and his breathing deepened , his massive stomach rising and falling as though steam were churning beneath it . " All right , " he said , " come in next week with reasons for including McNab 's murder and I 'll listen to them . Anything else ? " He surveyed those at the table . No one spoke , so he adjourned the meeting until three o'clock on Monday . Ginger Johnson and Rick Petrone were in Lydia 's office when she returned . Lydia sat on the love seat . " I 'll be damned if I 'll be railroaded into doing a half-baked job ? " " Hey , " Petrone said , " what happened in there ? " Lydia told them . When she finished , Ginger said , " I kind of figured this would happen . I 'll work on the McNab files over the weekend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much ? " " Quite a bit . I 've picked up a lot of it from newspaper morgues and have a list of magazine pieces . I 'll start Xeroxing tomorrow at the library . " " Is he giving you a hard time ? " Petrone asked Lydia . " Senator MacLoon ? Yes , although I suppose he 's only doing what he feels is right . I guess I should give him that . I realize this is n't the only committee in Congress , and the Caldwell murder is n't the only thing on his mind . " " What can I do ? " Petrone asked . " Go home and have a good weekend , " Lydia said . " I think we all need a day or two to think about something else . Anything else . " " Thanks , troops , " Ginger said . " While you two play I 'll be grinding away . " " Let it go until Monday ? " " No , I 'm too interested , and besides my man and I are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . . . oh , Lydia , a Mr. Foster-Sims . . . very fancy ! . . . called while you were in the meeting , " Ginger said . " Did he leave a message ? " " Yes . He said he 's tired of hearing that you 're busy and insists on taking you to dinner tonight . " Lydia laughed . " I 'm so tired ? " " Go ahead , " Ginger said . " It 'll do you good . " " Well , we 'll see . Why do n't you two take off . I 'll return his call and see you on Monday . " They left Lydia alone in the office . She made a mental note to ask someone on Monday to seal up the windows . A brisk , steady stream of cold air seemed to pass right through the glass and kept the office in a constant chill . She dialed out and reached Clarence . " I wo n't take no for an answer , " he said the moment he recognized her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm not up to it ? " " I 'll do all I can to prop you up . Emlyn Edwards is performing Rachmaninoff at the Caldwell Center , including , I understand , the C-sharp minor prelude and two of the four concertos . And after that . . . I 'm leering , ca n't you tell ? " " Clarence , I ? " " No arguments . At the rate you 're going you 'll be old and gray by the end of the year . I want you while there 's still something left . . . I 'll pick you up at seven . We 'll go to the concert , have dinner afterward and . . " All right , " she said . " Maybe Rachmaninoff is what I need . " Though she knew it was something considerably less lofty , and that he was offering that too . They drove directly to the Caldwell Center . The audience was sparse as Lydia looked around for familiar faces , saw a few . Jason DeFlaunce eleganted out from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heated dialogue with a stage manager , then disappeared as quickly as he 'd appeared . " So how are things in the halls of Congress ? " Clarence asked after he 'd examined the program .  | " Hectic , also frustrating if interesting . " " You 'll tell me about it over dinner . " The concert was short . When it was over they went to the lobby , put on their coats and prepared to leave the theater . " Lydia ! " She turned to see Jason crossing the lobby . " So glad you could come , " he said . " Hello , Clarence . Lydia , could you and I find a quiet moment to talk ? " " I suppose so . . . " " I mean now . It will only take a moment . " Clarence shrugged , nodded to her to go ahead and get it over with . She followed Jason to a coatroom just off the lobby , and now empty . He looked back at the lobby . " Yes , Jason ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said in a stage whisper , " and neither does Veronica . " " About what ? " She too whispered , which struck her as silly . " About wanting to drag poor Jimmye 's death into the Senate investigation . " " Jason , I . . . " She paused as the realization of news having traveled so fast hit her . " Jason , how did you hear about it ? " " That 's really not important , " he said . " What 's important is that you would even consider doing it . " Lydia looked through the wide opening of the coatroom . Clarence was leaning against the wall , his coat on his arm , his face showing impatience . " I do n't want to be rude , Jason , but the committee 's workings are n't your business ? " " What about Veronica ? Are you going to tell me that she should n't be concerned ? God , Lydia , the poor woman 's gone through enough without having a trusted friend drag out old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you capable of that sort of ? " " Jason , Veronica asked me to take this job . I thought a lot about it before I agreed . Now that I 've taken it on I 've got to try to do it to the best of my ability , no matter what ? " " Even if it hurts Veronica ? " " I 'm sure that Veronica knows that the last thing I 'd ever want to do is hurt her . But if Jimmye 's death has any bearing  | on Cale 's death , then it must be included . I 'm sorry , Jason , but if Veronica wants to discuss it with me , I 'll certainly be available at any time . Well , good night . " As she started to leave the coatroom he said in a distinctly unpleasant voice , " Do n't disappoint us , Lydia . " It made her stop , turn and look hard at him . She started to say something , changed her mind and went on into the lobby , where she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked once they were in his car . " Nothing , really . Or more accurately , I 'm not sure . Well , I 've never liked Jason and I guess that colors my reaction to what he says or does . " " What did he say to you ? You 're obviously upset " She shook her head and forced herself to brighten the mood . " Where are we eating ? " " Well , I originally was going to make a reservation at Le Lion d'Or , but it 'll be too noisy . I want to hear all about your first two weeks with the committee , so I made a reservation at Aux Beaux Champs . I 'm in a beef mood . " " That 'll be crowded too . " " Nothing like the other , " he said as he turned down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the new Four Seasons Hotel in which the restaurant was located . " Besides , Doug McNeill will see to it that two fellow-Scotsmen are given a quiet table in a corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do , at least for the record . " For most of the meal  --  a fillet for Clarence that had been dry-hung to age for four weeks , according to the restaurant owner Douglas McNeill , and a terrine of baby coho salmon with truffles and pistachios for her  --  they avoided discussing Lydia 's committee work . They talked about music , the season 's concert activity in Washington and considered going to New York later in the year , if Lydia could free up the time , to catch some Broadway theater and just be together . It was over dessert that Lydia finally brought up what had  | happened over the past two weeks . Clarence listened patiently , and noted that there was a firmness in her voice that had been conspicuously absent two weeks earlier . She 'd been full of obvious doubt about her ability to handle the assignment . On the one hand Clarence had found her lack of confidence to be refreshing , this beautiful and bright forty-year-old woman demonstrating humility . It was a scarce commodity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her performance on a special Senate committee called to investigate the murder of a powerful man would not be helped by taking a humble-pie , toe-in-the-sand position , any more than a concert performance would be . Two weeks into the job , the change in her was welcome . Fact was , he was damned proud of her . She told him about her confrontations with Wilfred MacLoon , of the prevailing atmosphere on the committee that seemed to make it nothing more than a cursory public relations charade , and about Jason 's comments to her in the coatroom and the implication that Veronica Caldwell was upset by her decision to go into the Jimmye McNab case . " What a strange way to put it , " Foster-Sims said after she 'd repeated what Jason had said to her that evening . " ' Do n't disappoint us . ' That 's pretty damn presumptuous of him . " " I know this , Clarence , which may also be presumptuous , but if any real headway is going to be made by the committee it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'll bring it about . The senators see the committee as something to handle , not get too involved with . I suppose I ca n't blame them , they 've got other things to worry about , but damn it , I 've been given the responsibility to see that a full , fair investigation happens . That 's what I understood Veronica to say she wanted when she pushed for a committee in the first place , and insisted that I be special counsel . " " Maybe she 's changed her mind . Now that she 's a senator , maybe her priorities have shifted ? " " I 'd better have a talk with Veronica and see what her feelings are . " " That would make sense . What about your friends at the MPD ? "  | She sighed . " I 'm afraid my so-called friends have been pretty uncooperative . They refuse to release anything about the murder . I have to draw subpoenas this week . Clarence , can we leave ? I 'm suddenly very damn tired . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you call it a night . " " Oh . . . I ca n't . . . " She gripped his forearm , hoping he 'd understand . " I brought you a special present , Lydia , in honor of your new responsibilities . It 's at home ? " " Tomorrow ? " " No . I promise I wo n't keep you long . " Well , he always had been a liar , he told himself . This gift was a handsome , sleek , cassette tape deck with two extension speakers . " For your office , " he said . " And these go with it . " The package he handed her had cassette tapes of many of her favorite jazz artists  --  Ellington , Bill Evans , the Modern Jazz Quartet . " I hope they help you cope with all that congressional jazz . Sorry . . . bad pun . . . " " Clarence , thank you so much , not for the gifts , but for you .. . " " Listen , you happen to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did flunk as a piano student . " She wrapped her arms around him , and without another word they walked to the bedroom . " I want to stay with you tonight , " she told him . The words confirmed the obvious , but somehow she felt good saying them . The bed became a center of warmth and caring , their caresses tender and giving , the silence broken only by the sounds of their fulfillment . There were , she told herself as she lingered on the edge of sleep , some things that were just too important to be interfered with , even by the Senate of the United States . Outside , a heavyset man wearing a dark suit sat in a dirty , gunmetal gray sedan . He looked down at a steno pad on his lap on which he 'd noted the time they 'd arrived at the apartment and the time Lydia had said , " I want to stay with you to-  | night . " He adjusted a knob on a powerful receiver slung beneath the automobile 's dashboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny microphone concealed in Foster-Sims 's bedroom . Silence . The man stretched , scratched at his belly . He looked at his watch . It would be a long night , and he hoped they would wake up and say something else , anything else , before it ended , if only to break the monotony . That was what he disliked most about these assignments , the monotony , and the strain on his hemorrhoids from sitting all night .  | QUENTIN HUGHES walked briskly through the terminal at Chicago 's O'Hare Airport . His flight from Des Moines had been delayed , and he had only twenty minutes to make his connection to Washington . He stopped at a wall phone , gave the operator his credit card number and waited for his call to go through . Christa , his producer , picked up the page at WCAP . " I 've only a minute , anything I should know about ? Any calls ? " " Lots of them . A Ginger Johnson called . . . she 's from the Senate committee investigating the Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researcher . She 'd like to talk to you . " " Anybody else ? " " Nothing that ca n't wait . " " I have to go . I 'll probably be there just in time for the show . " " He picked up a small leather overnight bag from the floor . An eight-by-eight-inch package wrapped in plain brown paper had never left its secure spot beneath his arm . He hugged it even closer as he headed for the departure gate . " I can put that package in the overhead rack , " a flight attendant said once they were aloft . Hughes shook his head . " No , thanks , I 'll keep it with me . " She looked at him more closely . " Are you Quentin Hughes ? " " Yu " p ? " I 've seen you on TV . " " You live in Washington ? " " Uh-huh . I 've heard you on the radio too . " " Ears and eyes check out . How about the rest of you ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . " Excuse me , I have other passengers . " She provocatively ignored him throughout the flight , which had its desired effect . He liked her looks  --  medium height with dark brown hair and ultra-white , as the ads said , teeth that she frequently displayed , a little full in the hips but years away from that becoming a problem . As they prepared to land at National Airport she stood next to him . " Two whole days off . I think I 'll celebrate . " " With anybody in particular ? " " Not yet . " Discuss it at dinner ? " " A girl has to eat . " Moments later she returned and handed him a slip of paper on which she 'd written her address and phone number ... . " I 'll drive you home , " he said . " Time 's a problem for me , I 'm afraid . I 've got a show to do tonight . " He arrived at the studio at 11:45 . He and the flight attendant . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . had ordered in Chinese food and had lingered in her small apartment until he 'd had to leave . He told her he 'd call the next day but knew he would n't . He lingered for a few minutes after the show with the departing guest , a professor of geology at George Washington University . Out of the corner of his eye he saw Christa scooping up paraphernalia from the table , including the package he 'd carried with him from Des Moines , and that had sat next to the microphone throughout the program . " Do n't touch that , " he said from across the studio . " Pardon me . What 's in it , a bomb ? " He excused himself from the professor , grabbed up the package and went to his office . Christa followed . " I was cleaning up , that 's all , " she said . " What 's so important about that package , Quentin ? " " Nothing . . . something personal . " He glanced down at a slip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Am I supposed to call her back ? " " Yes , as soon as possible . "  | He put the paper in his jacket pocket . " What are you doing now ? " he asked . " Home to bed , like any good little girl about Washington . " " I 'll come with you . " She felt a distinct twinge of displeasure . . . anger , even ... at being so taken for granted , but a rush of expectation , willy-nilly , went with it . And in a way she was flattered . Obviously he was n't in the mood for the mindless young woman he 'd been living with ... . She fixed him eggs the way he liked , loosely scrambled , no butter , while he took a shower . She noticed that the package was n't in the bedroom . He came out of the bathroom wearing a robe he 'd kept there for years , and carrying the package beneath his arm . He sprawled out on the bed and waited for her to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuggled in beside him . " Why the hurry-up trip to Des Moines , Quentin ? " He talked between bites . " To see my mother , she has n't been feeling so hot . . " " Oh ? And she sounded so strong last week when she called ? " " Forget it , Christa . . . It was a good show tonight , huh ? " She punched him on the arm lightly . " It always is , and you know it . " " Yeah , right ... Hey , I 'm really beat , Christa , okay ? Wake me at eleven . Big day tomorrow ... " She reached for him beneath the folds of his robe , but he turned his back . She could wait . She removed the tray and watched television in the living room until eleven , then woke him . He rubbed his eyes , yawned and pulled her down on top of him . Damn him , it was worth waiting for ... . An hour later , Ginger Johnson received a call from Quentin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , then went on to tell him about her role with the committee and her need to talk with him about what he 'd observed at the Caldwell party , and to see whether his long association with the family might provide some insight into the murder . " I 've been through all this with the MPD ? "  | " I know that , but Ms. James thought " How is she ? " " Fine , just fine . Really , Mr. Hughes , I 'd only need an hour of your time . " " All right . How about dinner ? " " I was thinking of ? " " That 's the only time I 'm free for the next six months . " " Well , if that 's the case , I suppose I 'll have to work overtime . Any preference in restaurants ? " " Is the committee buying ? " " I suppose . " " " Good , make it Petitto 's , on Connecticut , Northwest . See you there at seven . " Ginger reported her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your flanks , he 's a dedicated womanizer . " " By me that 's not all bad , Lydia . The way things are going ... or not going . . . with Harold . " " Forewarned is . . . Did you ask him about getting the videotape of his last interview with Senator Caldwell ? " " I did n't have a chance but I 'll bring it up at dinner . You said you wanted to discuss the Jimmye McNab murder before I interviewed Hughes . " Lydia nodded . " The rumor is that Jimmye and Hughes had an affair . That would n't be so unusual , but some people say she represented one of the few real , two-way relationships he 's ever had . I 'll tell you what I know at lunch . Come on , my treat . " As Lydia and Ginger left the office to go to lunch , Quentin Hughes entered his apartment in the Watergate , placed the brown package in a fireproof , locked chest in the bottom of a closet and returned the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lay back on the couch , kicked off his shoes and thought about the last twenty-four hours . After a while he got up and called his mother in Des Moines . " I was worried about you , " she said . " You said you 'd call when you got home safe . You know I hate airplanes. "  | " Yeah , I know , momma , but I got busy . It was good seeing you . " You do n't visit enough . " " Yeah , well , maybe I 'll have more time in a couple of months . Thanks for keeping the package safe . " " I did just like you told me . I kept it under all the blankets in the closet and never told nobody it was here . I do n't even ask any more what 's in it . That 's your business , I guess . Thanks for the money . It costs so much to heat the house these days . I called the furnace man but he said ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll call soon . " " You say that but you never do , son , except when you need somethin ' . " " " Goodbye , momma . " Now he slept until Christa called him at five . He showered , shaved and left for his dinner engagement with Ginger Johnson , wondering as he drove to the restaurant what she looked like . All right , so he was a rat . . . but at least he liked women , which was more than you could say about most of the men in Washington .  | ALTHOUGH LYDIA had the power to issue subpoenas , she chose to make one final effort to obtain Horace Jenkins 's voluntary cooperation at the Washington MPD . She called and asked to see him . Evidently she caught him in a good mood because he immediately invited her to visit his office at her convenience . .. . " What can I do for you , Lydia ? " Jenkins asked after she 'd settled in the green vinyl chair and was served coffee by a clerk . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell me what sort of progress you 're making in the Caldwell case . " She sipped the coffee . " Happy to oblige . Let 's see , we 've finally interviewed everybody who was at the party . " " And ? " " And we 've ruled out about half . " " On what basis ? " " Instinct , connection or lack of it to the deceased , known attitudes about him , proximity to where he got it , witnesses who said somebody was with them when it happened , that sort of thing . How 's the coffee ? " " Delicious . " " " Well , we public servants aim to please . . . I suppose you want to know who 's still on the list . " " I suppose . " He called out to a clerk to bring him the latest Caldwell file , looked across the desk and smiled . " That 's a nice dress you 're wearing . I wish my ever-loving wife had one like it . . . " He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle , if you know what I mean . Happens , I guess , to women . " " Men , too , " Lydia said . He glanced down at his waist and nodded . " Well , it 's  | different too . I saw a play once where somebody says that men get better looking as they get older , and that women get to look more like the men . " What was the name of the play ? " He shrugged . " I never can keep them straight . " The clerk brought in the file , and Jenkins handed Lydia six typewritten pages from it . " Mind if I read it now ? " she asked . " When else ? It 's not leaving here . " She dropped the papers on the desk and leaned forward . " Why do we have to go through this all the time ? I do n't want to use the committee 's subpoena powers , but you keep forcing the issue . " " Department policy , Lydia , and you know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He winced , placed his hand over his heart . " What do you want to do , Lydia , blow my pension ? " She said nothing , just sat there and stared . He removed his hand from his chest . " All right , all right , I 'll give you a copy . " He opened the file folder and handed her a Xerox of the original she held in her hands . It was obvious that he 'd intended all along to give it to her but was going to drag out the process . No easy victories with Jenkins . " I 'd still like to look at it here , " she said . " Be my guest . " She quickly scanned the list , and recognized many of the names , including both Caldwell sons ; Veronica Caldwell ; Jason DeFlaunce ; Quentin Hughes ; Caldwell 's aide , Richard Marvis ; Boris Slevokian ; Charles , the assistant Senate restaurant manager ; various members of the Caldwell Performing Arts Center 's board of directors ; Senator Wilfred MacLoon and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence Foster-Sims . " Some of these names are ridiculous , " she said . He puffed up one cheek and ran a finger around the perimeter of his ear . " Tell me why ? " " Clarence Foster-Sims , Boris Slevokian , the piano player ? "  | " What 's the matter , Lydia , you got a thing for overaged mu-sicians ? " " I wo n't say what I 'm thinking , " she said . " Veronica Caldwell ? Now , why would she kill her husband ? " " I did n't say everybody on that list necessarily had a reason to do him in . All I said was that this list narrows down the possibilities . Everybody on it was unaccounted for at the time he was killed . . . Okay , so you 've got the list . What next ? " " The transcripts of the interviews you did with everyone at the party . " " Why everybody ? We already cut the list in half . " " That 's right , you did . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's not my problem , Lydia . What you want is for the MPD to do your work . You want interviews ? Then grow your own . " She sighed and pulled the hem of her dress down a little lower over her knees . He took his eyes from them and focused on something behind her . " Look , chief , " she said , " I do n't understand why you 're viewing me and the committee as adversaries . It seems to me that a lot of money and time could be saved by sharing what we have . Does n't that make sense ? " " Sure , if you had something to share . Have you ? " " I hope to soon . We 're beginning to follow up leads and ideas . I have a small staff . We 'll do all we can , but your help would make things much easier . Why wo n't you cooperate ? " " Because it 's one-sided , Lydia . More than that , this department is under the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. and we 're supposed to solve the crime . If we do n't , people say we 're bums . Nobody likes to be called a bum , never mind being one . Add on that the victim is a senator and everything gets magnified a hundred times . You remember the McNab case ? Two years and nothing , not a damn lead . Did you read the column in the paper a couple of days ago ? The hotshot who wrote it all of a sudden is Sherlock Holmes , and he claims there must be a connection between Caldwell and McNab . " She was glad he 'd brought up the subject of Jimmye  | McNab . " Well , is n't there a possible connection ? " she asked . " After all , Senator Caldwell raised Jimmye McNab from in-fancy ? " " Yeah , I know that , but that does n't mean their murders had anything to do with each other . " " But maybe they did . Anyway , that 's one line of inquiry we 're following ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Caldwell .. . pardon me , Senator Caldwell . . . she 's not what you 'd call happy that the McNab and Caldwell murders are being linked . She wants the McNab thing put to rest as much as her husband did . " Lydia thought for a moment , then asked with genuine puzzlement , " Are you suggesting that Senator Caldwell wanted Jimmye McNab 's murder investigation stopped ? " " I did n't say that , Lydia . All I meant was that neither of them , the senator or his wife , were happy about what developed . Can you blame them ? It 's bad enough your daughter gets killed by some nut in a park without having it dragged on and on , in the papers , on TV , all of that . It makes us look pretty foolish , huh ? " " Like bums . " " " That 's right . Hey , McNab was a popular TV reporter . Even though the family did n't push to have the murder solved , lots of other people did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an inference that Senator and Mrs. Caldwell did n't cooperate in the investigation . " " Well , she was n't really their daughter . " " I know that , but she might as well have been . " Jenkins checked a wall clock behind her . " Sorry , but I 've got to move on . The commissioner wants to see me in a half hour . " " About the Caldwell case ? " " Who knows ? Satisfied ? " " No . " " What 'll make you happy ? " " The transcripts of the interviews you did , and a chance to look at the McNab file . " " He shook his head .  | " Back to square one , a subpoena . " " You want me to level with you , Lydia ? " " That would be refreshing . " " Come on , Lydia , I got a job to do , just like you , only for me the stakes are bigger . You and the committee will go through the motions and then announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any government official in Caldwell 's murder . Me , I 'm still left with everybody looking over my shoulder and demanding that we solve the crime . " Lydia knew that much of what he said was true , and she felt some sympathy for him . She and the committee were dabbling in crime , dilettantes in a grimy game that he lived with every day and would continue to live with until he either retired or dropped dead . Still , she knew she could n't allow sympathy to get in the way of the job she 'd taken on . She slipped her copy of the list into a slim leather briefcase . Jenkins saw the look of disappointment on her face and extended his hands across the desk , palms up , as though to say , Do n't be mad at me . " Thanks for your time , " she said coolly . " You want the transcripts ? " " I 'll have them one way or the other . " " Just sit a minute . " He swiveled in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaned back so that Lydia could see past him and said , " There 's all the copies . They 're too heavy for you to carry . Send somebody over for them . " She smiled . " Thanks , I really appreciate it . " His face hardened , and he pointed his index finger at her . " But I warn you , Lydia , that committee you 're working for , like every other damn committee , has enough leaks to sink a destroyer . One leak on what I give you and you can go whistle for anything else . Now and forevermore . " " I 'll remember that , " she said , meaning it . His concerns were justified , and she determined to do everything in her power to keep the materials private and within the confines of the committee . " I 'll have somebody over here this afternoon . " " Okay . " " What about the McNab files ? Can I see them ? "  | " Yeah , but here . No copies . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He suddenly grimaced with pain . " Damn arthritis . I must have slept funny . " " Take an aspirin . " " Thanks , doc . Hey , do you know what I read in one of those flaky magazines my wife buys ? " " No , what ? " " That sex is the best medicine for arthritis . " " I would n't know about that . " " A pretty gal like you ? " " I do n't have arthritis . " Lydia returned to her office in the Senate Building and arranged for a messenger to accompany her to MPD headquarters later that afternoon to transfer copies of the transcripts back to her apartment . She 'd originally intended to ask Rick Petrone to handle the chore and bring the transcripts to the office , but Jenkins 's warning about leaks weighed heavy on her mind . Until she 'd personally had a chance to go through the transcripts there was no sense in having them in an office where staff members would have access to them . She realized that Ginger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about her . At one o'clock the researcher called and said she 'd been tied up at the library and would be in by three . Lydia asked about her dinner meeting with Quentin Hughes and was assured that she 'd be given all the details when Ginger returned . Lydia had lunch sent up from the Senate Dining Room . She 'd been reluctant to do that but finally decided to take advantage of such services in the interest of saving time . She tipped the waiter , who delivered quiche Lorraine , a salad and black coffee . She was n't sure whether tipping was proper in the Senate , but the quickness with which he accepted it settled the question . Ginger arrived at four , just as Lydia was about to leave to meet the messenger service at Horace Jenkins 's office . " Sorry I 'm late , " she said breathlessly , her red hair hanging in limp  | strands over her face . " I got engrossed in what I was doing and lost track of time . Where are you going ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rundown on the Hughes meeting . " I ca n't go over it that quickly , " Ginger said . " I 've got a zillion notes I made after I got home . But this is why I was late . " She handed Lydia a copy of a newspaper article on which she 'd circled in red a paragraph near the bottom . Lydia skipped down to the circled portion . Chief Jenkins was asked whether an autopsy on the victim 's body had been performed . He said that it had n't , and went on to explain that the cause of death was so obvious that there was no MPD need for an autopsy . " I do n't believe it , " Lydia muttered . " An autopsy is routine in murder cases . " " Not in the Jimmye McNab murder evidently , " said Ginger . " It struck me as odd . That 's why I circled it . " " I 'm glad you did . I 've got to go . " " Need any help ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the office . He picked it up , held it out for Lydia . " It 's Senator Veronica Caldwell . " Lydia took the phone . " Hello , Veronica . " She was n't sure whether she should say " senator " despite their friendship , but her first name just naturally came out . " Hello , Lydia , how are things going ? " " Getting there . How are you ? " " All right . I was wondering whether we could get together tonight ? " Lydia knew she had little choice but to agree , although she 'd had her heart set on spending the evening in her apartment reading through the transcripts . " All right , " she said . " Would you come to the house ? " " Yes , of course . What time ? " " I wo n't be able to get away from here until six . Make it seven-thirty . We 'll have dinner together . "  | " Fine , I 'll see you then . " " Anything I can do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " No , thank you , Rick . I 'm having dinner with Mrs. Caldwell . " " What happened today ? I got caught up with Senator MacLoon 's schedule and never got a chance to get over here . " " I thought you belonged to me . " " That 's what I thought too , but he said you would n't mind losing me for a day . We had the vote on the Wyoming dam project and all hell broke loose . What did I miss ? " " Well , I think the MPD is about to start cooperating . " His face showed how impressed he was . " What did they give you ? " " Oh , not much , just enough to keep me reading for the next few nights . " She started to leave . " You and Ginger will lock up ? " " Sure . Have a nice night . " It was n't until she was in her Buick and about to join the flow of traffic that she realized she 'd already told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she 'd specifically mentioned that she 'd been given the transcripts , then decided she had n't and felt better about it . Besides , she had considerable faith in the people she was working with . She headed directly for the MPD , where two young men from the messenger service were waiting . Forty-five minutes later they 'd deposited the boxes of transcripts in her living room and left . She looked at the boxes , fought the urge to open one and headed for the shower . At seven-thirty on the nose , dressed in a gray cashmere sweater and pleated green and blue tartan skirt , her face free of makeup , her hair pulled back , she arrived at the Caldwell house in Mount Vernon .  | IT WAS N'T until after dinner that Veronica drifted into a monologue about having taken Cale 's place in the Senate . There was nothing maudlin about it , and she even spiced it with humorous asides about her Senate colleagues . " How about some more coffee in the den ? " she asked . " Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and Veronica tossed two small logs into it , saying , " Cale made such wonderful fires . I suppose it was because he kept an eye on it , never allowed it to dwindle too low . " Lydia settled in a club chair and watched as Veronica arranged the coffee service on a rolling cart . It struck her then , as it had many times before , how smoothly and easily Veronica moved in a social situation . She had , of course , been born into a milieu in which social grace was expected . A good hostess never betrayed any hints of nervousness or lack of ease , and Veronica had learned the lesson well . Aside from the pull of fatigue around her eyes , Veronica looked as lovely as ever . She wore a full plum skirt and frilly white blouse that buttoned high about her neck . Her auburn hair swooped softly over her temples and glistened in the flickering glow of the fire , like brandy picking up a candle 's light . Her figure , always on the lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely discernible thickening through the middle was evident if one bothered to look . " Would you like something in your coffee ? " Veronica asked . " No , I do n't think so . " " I think I will . Cale taught me the pleasure in that . " She uncorked a bottle of cognac and added a few drops to her cup . Veronica sat on the couch , sniffed the contents of her cup , then took a long , slow sip . " Well , where were we ? "  | " You were telling stories out of school , " Lydia said . " I suppose I was . Cale used to come home and we 'd sit up late while he told me about what had happened during the day . God , Lydia , the Senate is an amazing mix of individuals , each with his own point of view . How anything ever gets done is a wonder of the world . " " I know what you mean . It 's a maze . " Veronica sipped her coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cale always said that negotiation was the key , negotiation and compromise . I used to argue with him sometimes for compromising his beliefs in order to get a bill through or to bring about harmony on a committee . I wish I had n't . . . " For a moment , she thought her hostess might burst into tears . " Yes , compromise , Lydia , is the key to everything , including your work with the committee . " " Of course , " said Lydia . " I 'm well aware of that . I really have n't to do much of it yet , but I 'm certain my time will come " Maybe it already has , Lydia . " " How so ? " " Suggesting that Jimmye 's death be brought into Cale 's investigation . " " Well . . . Jason mentioned to me that you were upset about that , Veronica . I 'm glad you brought it up . I think we should discuss it . " Veronica placed her cup on the cart . " Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about when it comes to this matter . Frankly , personal feelings aside , I can not for the life of me see anything of value to be gained by going into the old investigation of Jimmye 's murder . It 's a totally unrelated matter that coincidentally happened to a family that has just suffered a second tragedy . Jimmye was bludgeoned to death by a madman , probably a drug addict or former mental patient . At least that 's what the police have decided . Cale was murdered by someone who obviously had some political or financial gain as a motive , or thought he had . " Her laugh was forced . " I simply would n't have thought that someone with your usual clear  | view of things would even suggest lowering an entire Senate committee 's role to something like this . This family is not a continuing soap opera , Lydia . " Lydia was taken aback at the tone of the comment . She said , rather reluctantly , " I 'd hardly characterize my work with the committee as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Veronica sat forward and held up her hands . " Please , Lydia , forgive me . I did n't mean it the way it sounded . It 's been a long , hard day and my tongue evidently is n't connected to my brain at this point . " " Lydia nodded . " We all suffer that malady now and then . Let 's forget it was even said . " " Yes . " " But I would like to discuss Jimmye 's death and how it might relate to the committee 's investigation . I suggested to Senator MacLoon and to the full committee that we do it , and I still feel that way . Naturally , I 'm willing to ? " " Compromiser ' " Well , to change my mind if there 's some good reason that rve missed . " " Is n't the fact that her death is obviously not connected reason enough to drop it ? The committee has a definite , narrow charter , Lydia  --  to investigate Cale 's murder and to establish that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , to identify that link , resolve it and allow the Senate to get on with its business with a satisfied American public behind it and not riddled with the sort of doubts that have plagued the Kennedy assassination for all these years . " " I understand that , Veronica , I really do . But what harm is there in at least looking at how Jimmye 's death might shed some light on Cale 's murder ? I 'm not suggesting a long drawnout investigation , just a reasonable , limited examination of facts . " Veronica stiffened , although her voice did not reflect it . She said softly , " If you do n't see the wisdom in what I say , Lydia , perhaps a more personal approach would be more acceptable .  | Frankly , I 'm not sure I could stand up to another public hanging-out of Jimmye 's wash . Can you understand that ? " " Yes , of course . You 've been through far more than most people should ever be asked to take on . I recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you know . The thought of opening up Jimmye 's case through the committee must be abhorrent to you . But I have to remind you , Veronica , that you were the one who pushed for a Senate committee in the first instance , and who asked me to serve as its special counsel . " " I 'm aware of that . To be perfectly candid , one of the reasons for wanting you was the faith I had in your sense of decency and taste . I 've always known you to be an extremely sensitive woman , Lydia , a compassionate one too . I 'm asking for a demonstration of that now . " " Even if it means not doing my job ? " " We all bend at times , Lydia , in the name of decency , out of respect for our friends and their feelings . " Lydia was confused . What Veronica had said made sense , and yet something inside her rebelled against dropping the Jimmye McNab matter . " I 'm having trouble sorting out how I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . If I promise to carefully reconsider introducing Jimmye into the investigation , will that do it , at least for this evening ? " " It will have to , wo n't it ? " There was frost in her voice . " Lydia . . . there 's more to this than I 've indicated . " " I wondered . . . I 'd like to know . " " I 'd hoped I would n't have to be this direct , but perhaps the direct approach is , as they say , the kindest . Senator MacLoon is extremely unhappy over you as special counsel . He feels that you have n't the experience in government to fully understand the meaning of such a committee and its role in Congress . As you know , he 's dead set against expanding the investigation to include Jimmye 's death . If you insist on going ahead , even though there is n't a shred of evidence to support it , I 'm afraid your position with the committee might be in jeopardy . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia said tightly . " I 'm involved because I was asked to be by people for  | whom I care a great deal . I accepted the job because I think it 's important . Also because it 's a challenge . Naturally , I 'd not like to be fired , but " ? she shrugged and forced a smile ? " if that 's what comes from trying to do what I think is right , well , so be it .. Veronica closed her eyes and slumped back into the cushions of the couch . " Of course , you 're right , " she said so softly that Lydia had to lean forward and ask her to repeat it . " I said you 're right . ' You must forgive me , Lydia , perhaps I 've handled all this all wrong . That happens to people , I 'm told , who try to act too brave in the face of personal tragedy and never allow the impact of it to be felt , to come out . " She began to cry now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . " I 'm sorry , " Veronica said . " Do n't be . You 're right . There 's a time to let down and perhaps this is it . Cry , cry until it 's all out . " Which she did . Fifteen minutes later the two women stood together in the foyer . " Thank you , Veronica . . . for a good evening . " " Thank you for being here when I needed you . I have to ask one thing , Lydia , about Jimmye . " " Yes ? " " Whatever you do , please do it gently , and discreetly . " " You can count on that . " " I knew I could . . . be careful driving . " " I will . " She kissed her cheek and left . She arrived back at her brownstone in Washington without any memory of the trip , her thoughts totally on what had happened with Veronica . She 'd driven as though on automatic pilot , making her turns by rote , unaware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she aware that a gunmetal gray sedan had followed her ever since she turned onto the highway outside the Caldwell estate . Its driver parked a block away from the brownstone and waited until she had reached her bedroom and turned on the lights . He pushed a button on a cheap digital watch ; its face lit up . He noted her time of arrival on a pad , lit a cigar and  | drummed his fingers on the steering wheel . He would be here for the rest of the night . An assignment was an assignment . As he often told his wife when she complained about his being out all night , " It 's a living . You do n't complain when you cash the checks . "  | IT TooK Lydia two nights to read through the transcripts given to her by Chief Horace Jenkins , and she found little of overriding significance in them . Mark Adam Caldwell 's statements were the most provocative . Although he 'd said nothing overtly hostile toward his father , Lydia read between the lines a festering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing . It occurred to her to check whether the interviews had been recorded . She assumed they had been . Certainly a great deal more could be found out by actually listening to the comments than from reading them on a typed page . She called Clarence and asked whether his interrogator had used tape . " Yes , he did . Why do you ask ? " " No reason , Clarence . " She almost told him she had the transcripts but thought better of it . The fewer people who knew about it the better . As it stood , only she and Jenkins knew that they were in her possession . At some point , of course , she 'd have to share them with the committee , but for now , there was something comforting about having sole possession . She had n't decided yet about whether to press the McNab matter . She knew that if she did , she 'd have to make a good case with the committee , and she could n't even begin to build it until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MPD . " Time , " she muttered to herself as she sat behind her desk in the committee office and reviewed a preliminary list of potential witnesses to call before the committee once it shifted into that phase of the investigation . She had to do everything herself at this stage , though of course she 'd created that situa-  | lion by keeping the transcripts away from her office and staff , and by agreeing to personally review the McNab files . She called Horace Jenkins at the MPD . He was grumpy , and when she said she 'd like to spend Thursday reviewing the McNab files , he mumbled , " Just stay out of the way . " Ginger returned from lunch , hung up her pea jacket and closed the door . " Can I talk to you for a minute ? " " Sure . " The researcher , wearing beige corduroy pants tucked into tan cowboy boots , a heavy purple turtleneck sweater and a massive , noisy necklace made of random pieces of silver and copper , sat in a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The older I get , the weirder people get . " 11 Lydia could n't help but laugh . " How old are you , Ginger , twenty-eight ? " " An old twenty-eight . Anyway , just before I went out to lunch I got a call from Quentin Hughes . " " What did he want ? " " Dinner . " " And . . . ? " " And this time he 's invited me to his apartment at Watergate . " " Are you going ? " " Only because I 'm a dedicated employee of the committee . " Lydia smiled , but Ginger shook her finger . " I 'm serious . Quentin Hughes is not my type . Well , I was n't doing anything anyway . Harold still says he needs more space to get his act together about us . So , I accepted . The point is I 'd like to know just how Lydia looked down at the mass of papers on her desk , sighed and said , " I do n't know . You told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit anything about a relationship with her . Right ? " " Right . But the way he avoided it makes me feel that there was something between them , maybe even more than the rumors indicated . " " The problem , Ginger , is that while it all might have some  | bearing on the Caldwell murder , I ca n't justify having you pursue it . To be honest , I 'd have to say that at this point it does n't seem to matter . If Hughes did have an affair with her , it ca n't tangibly be linked to what we 're doing here . I wish I could encourage you because frankly I 'm fascinated with it and have this nagging feeling that there is a connection between the two deaths . But I 've been put on notice that to drag the McNab case into it might cost me my job and if I ca n't ? " " Well , maybe you 're not so far wrong . This is what I really wanted to talk to you about . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice guy who 's recently divorced . He 's really not my type , but what 's a girl to do ? I wo n't tell you his name because I would n't want to betray his trust . Understand ? " " I 'm not sure . . . go on . " " Okay . Jack is an FBI man . I thought that was pretty heavy stuff until I got to know what he really does . He audits books , for God 's sake , handles records , things like that . I mean , it was a real letdown when I realized he was n't the one who shot Dillinger . Anyway , I told him that I was working on the Caldwell committee . . . I hope that 's okay ... I told him , and he asked me questions about it . I did n't answer all of them because I did n't want to be talking out of turn . But when I mentioned Jimmye McNab , he gave me one of those wry smiles and said , get this , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ? " Lydia raised her hand to stop what was too offensive to hear . " I 'm not joking , " Ginger said . " How would this man know such a thing , even if it were true , which I 'm sure it is n't . " " The pipeline . " " From the MPD to the FBI ? " She nodded . " He was n't sure of the source and the circumstances , but he remembered talk about Senator Caldwell having been . . . how did he put it ? . . . having been intimately involved ' with Jimmye McNab . " " Nonsense . Caldwell was her father , or like her father . She was his wife 's niece . They 'd raised her like a daughter ? "  | " Not legally a daughter . " " It does n't matter . I knew the man and his family . It 's too farfetched even to speculate on such a thing . " Or was it ? she was forced to ask herself . She 'd had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P Ginger fiddled with a broken fingernail and gave Lydia one of those " think what you want " looks . " All I 'm doing is passing on what I was told . And he is with the FBI ? " " Did he say anything else that might substantiate it ? " " No . " " It 's all too= " Too what ? " " Too soap opera . " And Lydia immediately regretted saying it , remembering it was how Veronica had characterized her interest in the McNab murder . " Some people say that 's what Washington is , one long-running soap opera . " " Not to me , and not to you either . You 're too young to be a ? 99 cynic . " Well , the point is that maybe there was a link between the murders ... want my advice ? " Of course . " " Follow it up . Ask around . Caldwell 's sons , his wife . I think it 's true . " " I do n't . " But of course she half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so long that she could n't express . " Let 's go back to Quentin Hughes . You said he agreed to send over the videotape of the interview he did with Senator Caldwell . " " That 's right . I 'll ask him about it again tonight . " " Ginger , be careful tonight . " " Careful ? Why ? " Lydia was sorry her motherly instincts had come out . She said in a deliberately light voice , Well , you know , he 's a lech . " " Old lecher like him are never a problem . " Like hell , Lydia thought but did n't say . After Ginger left the office , she thought about their conversation , especially what Ginger had said about Cale Caldwell and Jimmye McNab.  | " Absurd , " she said to no one , not really believing her own disbelief . Senator MacLoon 's call broke in . He skipped the amenities . " Do we have a witness list yet ? " " I 'm working on it , senator . It depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring it up at tomorrow 's meeting . " " I 'd like to have the list finalized by Friday and release it at a press conference . " " Press conference ? " " I think it 's time to report on what progress we 've made . Do you object ? " " I think it might be premature . The question of the McNab murder should be resolved first . " " You said you 'd be presenting your reasons on that for the committee to consider . We 're waiting . " " I 'll try to do that on Friday . I think any press conference should be postponed until the middle of next week . " He made a show of patronizing indulgence . " All right , but let 's wrap up things on Friday . . . a witness list , the McNab thing put to rest , all of it . Is that agreeable ? " " It will have to be , senator . " He hung up , and Lydia returned her attention to the list of potential witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , members of the Caldwell family , personal friends of the deceased and unspecified members of the Washington MPD . She flipped through a Rolodex until coming to Cale Caldwell , Jr . ' s office number , dialed it and told the woman who answered that she wanted to speak to Mr. Caldwell . " Oh , hello , Miss James , this is Joanne Marshall . We met at Mrs. Caldwell 's house . Hold on just a moment . " Cale came on the line . " Hello , Lydia , sorry to keep you waiting . " " That 's all right . I was wondering whether we could get together today . " " Today 's almost gone . " " I know , but there 's been a shift in schedules that 's pushed  | up my timetable . I 'd really appreciate a chance to talk , even a half hour . " " Well , I ca n't get out of here this afternoon , but I could have a drink after work . " " That would be fine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before you hang up , I was wondering whether you could put me in touch with your brother . " " Well , I . . . you could call him . " " I know , but I 'd rather have you arrange a meeting between us , preferably before Friday . " " That might not be easy , Lydia . He 's . . . you know how he is , very secluded down there with his friends , very much keeping to himself . " " Let me be honest with you , Cale . I 'm making up the witness list for the committee . Naturally you and Mark will have to be on it . I thought it might be helpful for me at least to be able to preinterview your brother before he 's subjected to the full committee 's questions . I 'm suggesting it for his sake , nothing else . I want to be helpful . " " I appreciate that , Lydia . Tell you what I 'll do , I 'll get ahold of him and suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do . I really do n't have any control over my brother 's life . " " I realize that , Cale . Anything you could do would be appreciated . " " I 'll let you know when I see you how I made out . See you then . " An hour later she received a call from a man who introduced himself as Francis Jewel , executive director of the Center for Inner Faith , the cult Mark Adam Caldwell belonged to . " I understand you wish to speak with one of our brothers , Mark Adam . " " Yes , that 's right . Did his brother call you ? " " Yes . It is our policy to shield our brothers and sisters from the secular life as much as possible . Naturally , since we are a law-abiding church , we are always willing to cooperate in legitimate matters . .  | " That 's to be admired , Mr. Jewel . Are you calling to arrange for the meeting I asked for ? " " Reluctantly . Obviously , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was counseled against it but went against the wishes of his brothers and sisters , and his God . I recognize that there are certain obligations he now must meet regarding the investigation into his father 's death . One must always pay for one 's transgressions . His brother told me that you would be subpoenaing him to appear before your Senate committee but wished to speak informally with him first . " " That 's right " " You do realize that there is no binding reason for him to agree to this . " " Of course " His tone had begun to grate on her . " He 's free , is n't he , to make his own decision in such a matter ? " " Apparently you 're one of those who believe what you read about how we exert control over our members . " " " I 've heard things , Mr. Jewel . I do n't prejudge . May I see Mark Adam Caldwell ? " " Under certain conditions . What happens to him reflects , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview with him , but I insist on being present . If that is acceptable to you , we can set a day and time . " " " Why must you be there ? " " To protect his interests . " " His or yours ? " " Perhaps both . When would you like to see him ? " " Tomorrow morning ? " " Ten ? " " Fine . " " You know how to find us ? " " I 'll manage . " Brother ! Cale Caldwell , Jr. , was waiting at Hogate 's bar when Lydia arrived . He was especially cordial as he greeted her , then placed their order with a busy bartender.  | " Thank you for calling your brother 's church for me . " " They got back to you ? " " Yes , a Mr. Jewel . I did n't like him , do n't like anything about the arrangements that have been made , but I guess I have no choice . In order to see your brother , Mr. Jewel insists on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree with you , of course , but I suppose I 've gotten used to it . Ever since Mark joined the Center for Inner Faith everyone in the family has been subjected to that sort of thing . I 'm afraid there 's nothing can be done about it . That 's the way they work , and if you want something from them you play by their rules . " Lydia sipped her drink and stared at the highly polished bar . " It 's bad , Cale . These cults and their hold over their followers . They 're a real threat . There should be more investiga-tions ? " " It 's touchy , " Cale said . " Start messing with religion , or what purports to be a religious group and you run the risk of being called intolerant , messing with constitutional rights .. . hey , you 're a lawyer , you know all about it . " She nodded . " Still , after Jonestown . . . Anyway , what attracted your brother to it , do you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to allow a man behind him to reach for his drinks . " Mark is . . . well , Mark has always been different , Lydia . He has an intensity about him that , once upon a time , was appealing to mom and dad . He 'd get into something and it became the only thing in the world . It did n't matter whether intellectually he knew it was dangerous . It was as though he went into a trance , all judgment was suspended . Still , it was n't something that you could take serious exception to . After all , he excelled at whatever he did . He became the best wrestler in high school , the best weight lifter , the most knowledgeable astronomer . Nothing halfway with Mark . He could blot out the world once he dove into something . Frankly , I often envied him that singleminded dedication until , of course , it led him into something like this damn cult . " Lydia glanced around . The bar was filled with attractive  | people , animated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone recognized her and waved . She returned the greeting , then turned back to Cale . " Cale , do you think your brother was . . . capable of murdering his father ? Do you think he had a reason to ? " For a moment she thought he might actually strike her . He gripped his empty glass , his mouth tensed . Then , abruptly , he seemed to relax . " Yes . " Now it was her turn to react . " You do understand that I 'm not suggesting that he did . " " You said capable ' . . . yes . My brother , as much as I love him , is a disturbed person . It 's gotten worse over the years . Naturally , everyone in the family has denied it . After all , what 's a family for ? . . . Do I actually think Mark killed his father ? Of course not . . . " " Any ideas ? " she asked , noting that his last words sounded more a demurrer than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I bet the police will never come up with a good answer , and the same goes for your committee . It will be another unsolved murder , more important than most because of dad 's position , but unsolved . . . which of course will be the ultimate blow to mother , not having an answer to it . I hope it wo n't happen , but I bet it will . " " I 'd like another drink , Cale . " " So would I. " After they were served Lydia decided to press him more on his brother as a good suspect . He drew himself up straight , smiled pleasantly . " If you would n't mind , Lydia , I 'd just as soon not talk about this any more . " " I 'm sorry . . . well , how are things going with you ? " " Personally or professionally ? " " Either , both . " " Professionally , first-rate . Personally , up and down . Which makes me part of the human race , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems easier to get professional things in line than personal ones . "  | " Ah , yes . " He wiggled , Groucho Marx fashion , an imaginary cigar between his fingers . " Nothing is as unsolvable as the man-woman thing , right ? ' " Right . " " Are you seeing Clarence ? " he asked . " We 're old and good friends . " He shrugged , took a drink . " I thought there might have been more to it than that . " She said nothing . Then . . . " I had dinner with your mother . " " She told me , said it was a nice evening . " " Yes . . . she 's an amazing woman , Cale , so strong , able to rise above the worst . . . I saw it when Jimmye died , and now again with your father . " The mention of Jimmye made him grimace . She decided to follow through on it . " Cale , can you think of anything that might link Jimmye 's murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye , said very firmly , " No . " " Neither , it seems , can most people , including your mother . She 's quite upset that I 've suggested it as an area of inquiry for the committee . " He nodded . " She told me . " " How do you feel about it ? " " The way she does . We 'd all rather see Jimmye 's death stay a thing of the past . It 's too painful to bring it up , and it serves no useful purpose . " Lydia cocked her head . " Still , I 'd think the family of a murdered daughter would n't . . . could n't stop pressing until her killer was brought to justice ? " " Jimmye 's a different matter ? " " Why ? " " Well , she was n't , after all , a Caldwell ? " " Legally , no , in every other way , yes . " " Drop it , Lydia , for mother 's sake . For all our sakes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to reconsider , but ... " She thought about Ginger 's news from her FBI friend , but of  | course made no mention of it . . . " Are you aware , by the way , that an autopsy was never performed on Jimmye ? " " I would n't know about that . " He shifted position at the bar . " Do you know why ? " He turned . " I said I would n't know about that . " " All right , Cale , I did n't mean to bring up a tender sub-ject ? " " It 's not a tender subject , it 's just that . . She waited for him to finish . " Look , there were problems with Jimmye that no one outside the family knew about , and that 's the way it should stay . " " I agree that family matters belong within a family , unless they have to do with a murder . " She waited for a response . He glanced at others at the bar , peered into his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " Jimmye and my brother had a problem between them that damn near tore us all apart . " " What sort of problem ? " " A very personal one . It does n't matter what it was . The point is that to drag her life up now accomplishes nothing but opens all the sores . That 's not fair , Lydia , it 's not right . " " Cale , you have to believe me when I say that I have no interest in meddling in your family 's affairs . Just the opposite . I hear what you say and I sympathize , I do . . . But I ask you again , is there anything to your knowledge that would support examining Jimmye 's murder in light of your father 's death ? If there is , anything at all , it 's not , to use your words , fair or right not to say so . " " No , nothing . " " This personal problem you mention between Jimmye and your brother . Are you inferring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her death ? " " Of course not . " He shook his head . " For God 's sake , Lydia , how could you twist it around like that ? " " Cale , no matter what your feelings are , please at least take into account that I am special counsel , at your mother 's suggestion , to a committee whose job it is to get to the bottom of ? "  | " I know , I know . . . one more for the road ? " " No , thank you . I appreciate your taking time to see me like this , and for arranging an interview with your brother . I 'm sorry if I 've upset you ? " " I want to help , Lydia . We all . do . About Mark , just remember that you 're dealing with a disturbed young man . Do n't be shocked at anything he says or does . Do n't take him too literally . " Lydia went to her brownstone , where she showered , slipped into a robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled in again to review some of the transcripts , particularly those of Mark Adam Caldwell , Cale Caldwell , Jr. , and Quentin Hughes . Perhaps it was the fact that Ginger Johnson was , at that moment , having dinner with Hughes that prompted her to dig his transcript out of the pile and read it again .. . Later she put Mark Adam 's transcript in her briefcase , took a map of Virginia from her desk and studied routes to her destination in the morning . The Center for Inner Faith . It was located on the Prince William County side of Occaquan Creek , a little over a mile from a small airstrip known as Woodbridge Airport . She could n't deny her nervousness about making the trip and confronting Mark Adam within the grounds of the cult . She even considered calling in the morning and canceling the meeting . After all , nobody said she had to conduct private interviews with anyone on the suspects  --  just the opposite . MacLoon would be happy if she 'd play the game , conduct a tidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in official Washington had been responsible for or connected with the murder of the Senate Majority Leader . Get it over with , operate within the framework of MacLoon 's dictates , enjoy the limelight and get back to private practice which would , undoubtedly , grow at an even faster rate because of the notoriety . A whole cadre of prospective clients had already approached her firm inquiring about representation . They 'd read the articles about her in the papers and seen frequent mentions of her and of her role with the commit-  | tee on the nightly news . People had called and wanted to do a feature about her . The advertising agency for a leading Scotch wondered whether she would be interested in being part of its ad campaign featuring bright , attractive and successful young women , for God 's sake . She 'd become a celebrity in a town crawling with celebrities . She forced the question from her mind , rolled a pillow beneath her head and virtually willed herself to sleep . Ginger Johnson was using some willpower of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quentin Hughes had turned nasty after she 'd made it clear for the tenth  --  or was it fiftieth  --  time that she would not spend the night with him . He 'd started slow , had been a charming and entertaining host . He 'd told her that the woman he 'd been living with had recently taken off and that he was looking for a new " meaningful and permanent relationship . " He 'd actually said that . He 'd served a pleasant white wine before dinner , then uncorked a bottle of red to serve with bacon-wrapped filet mignons he 'd grilled on his Jenn-Air stove , complete with spinach salad , hot buttered French bread and for dessert , chilled slices of fresh pineapple . Throughout dinner Ginger had asked questions about the Caldwell investigation . Hughes seemed disinterested in the subject . When she again brought up the videotape of his interview with Cale Caldwell , he told her that he 'd changed his mind and that if anyone wanted to screen it they 'd have to come to the studio . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , showing an interview with a dead man . " Ginger knew Hughes had shown interviews with dead people before , and asked him why the Caldwell interview was different . He dismissed the question by coming around the table , putting his hands on her shoulders and kissing her on the neck . She squirmed free and they moved to the living room . From that point on the evening turned into an increasingly hectic seduction scene that ended with Ginger saying , " I  | do n't really like men who come on too strong , " and Hughes snapping , " And I do n't like broads who tease . " There was no debate when the evening would end . Hughes had to leave to do his all-night show . Slumped in a chair , he asked Ginger to stay until he came back . She said she guessed not . " You had your shot , you know , " he said as she took her sweater-coat from the closet . " At what ? " " At me . " " I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Well , thanks for the dinner , and do n't bother to get up . I can find the way . " She rode the elevator to the lobby , nodded to the doorman and went out to the street . She 'd been lucky enough to find a parking space only two blocks away and started to walk to it , in the direction of the Potomac and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts . . . She sensed that someone was walking behind her , looked over her shoulder and saw the figure of a man shrouded in shadow moving quickly toward her . She increased her pace with each step until she was about to break into a run . " Ginger . " The voice stopped her in her tracks . She turned .. . " Harold ? " " What were you doing in the Watergate ? " " I was . . . it 's none of your damn business . What are you doing , following me ? " " Of course not . I just wanted to see what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me ? You were the one who said you needed space to get your head together about us . I do n't believe this . You were actually following me . " " You 're crazy . I just happened to see your car and ? " . . and just knew that I was at the Watergate . " " I was around and ? " " Get lost , Harold . " " Please , Ginger , let 's talk . There are things I want to say to you . "  | " Being followed , at my age . " " I told you I was n't following you . " " Look , I do n't want to see you again . Do you understand ? " He grabbed her arm , tried to pull her back in the direction they 'd come from . " Leave me alone , damn it . " " Just an hour . I 've thought things out and ? " She wrenched free of his grip and stormed off toward where she 'd parked her car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her . " Who 'd you see ? " " The Washington Redskins , all of them , " she said without looking back . By the time she reached her car she 'd softened some about Harold . Obviously he was jealous , which , after all , meant he cared a good deal . She 'd think about that , and meanwhile decided she 'd been too flip and mean with him about the Redskins . It was , though , a pretty good if nasty line .. . She was half-smiling as she unlocked the car door , slid behind the wheel , started the engine and checked her mirror to see if it were clear for her to pull away from the curb . It was . She stepped on the accelerator and eased into the street . She had n't gone ten feet when she realized that something was wrong . She got out and looked at the rear of the car . The tire on the driver 's side was completely flat . " Damn , " she muttered , looking around for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to open it when she noticed that the other rear tire was also flat . This time her utterances were not as gentle . She realized she could n't leave the car in the middle of the street but did n't want to drive on the flat tires . There was no choice . . A few cars had already made wide circles around her , and one of the drivers had yelled something about women drivers who block traffic . Well , he knew what he could do . She was about to get back into the car and go back to the space she 'd just vacated when a man who 'd been watching from the shadows of a building suddenly stepped out into the street , came up behind her and brought his fist down sharply  | across the back of her head . She fell to the pavement . He stepped over her , opened the car door , grabbed her oversized purse from the seat and ran up the street . A woman who 'd witnessed the attack ran to Ginger 's side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginger struggled to sit up . " My head , " she said . " My God . . . " " I saw it all , " the woman said as she helped her to her feet . " Who did it ? " Ginger asked . " I could n't see his face , it all happened so fast . " Ginger suddenly swayed and grabbed the woman for support . " My head , " she moaned . The woman lowered her to the ground and told a small crowd that had gathered to call for an ambulance . It arrived twenty minutes later .  | THE CENTER for Inner Faith consisted of a large main house and four outbuildings on sixteen acres of gently rolling farmland that sloped down to the banks of the Occaquan Creek . The land around the house was overrun with weeds and thickets . Bent , bare trees formed bizarre sculptures against a pewter sky . A skinny yellow dog that had been asleep on the front porch raised its head and looked in the direction of Lydia 's car as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The road was pitted and scarred , and she had to be careful to avoid some of the larger holes . A young man with a shaved head , wearing a soiled , long white tunic , had been sitting by a front window . He too saw her car , sat up and shifted a . zz caliber rifle from his lap to a more ready position . Lydia stopped twenty yards from the house , turned off the ignition and took in her immediate surroundings . She was overwhelmed by the bleakness and desolation of it all . If the Center for Inner Faith were , indeed , a church , it was not exactly advertising it . There were no signs , no crosses , no nothing but an old farm , its buildings weather-beaten , its land scarred by years of exposure and neglect . As she got out of the car Lydia noticed the young man in the window . She clutched her briefcase beneath her arm and went to the porch . The dog did not growl , nor did it get up to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head raised . It had a sad face , or was that her imagination ? " Hello there , " Lydia said as she climbed a decaying set of wooden steps . " Good boy . " Calm down , she told herself . She needed it more than the dog . . . wrong , he needed it too .  | A low , guttural growl made her stiffen . " Easy boy , easy .. . me Lydia , you friend ? " The front door suddenly opened and the young man who 'd been observing her stood just inside , the rifle hanging loosely from one hand . " Miss James ? " he asked in a high-pitched voice . " Yes . He stepped back to allow her to pass . She cast a quick , final glance at the dog and stepped inside . Immediately to the right was a large room furnished like an office . Logs burned brightly in a fireplace . A man sat behind an elaborately carved desk . He too bad a clean-shaven head . He was considerably older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The massive desk dwarfed him even when he stood . " I 'm Francis Jewel , Miss James . Please come in and warm yourself by the fire . " She entered the room . Jewel extended his hand and she took it . The touch of him was not pleasant . His hand was small and cold ; it felt like wax . " Thank you for allowing me to come . " " There seemed little choice , " he replied , pointing to a ladder-back chair next to the desk . " Would you care for coffee or tea ? I 'd recommend the tea . We make it with cinnamon , herbs and honey . " " The tea sounds fine . " Jewel motioned to the young man at the door , then resumed his seat behind the desk . He leaned back , his tiny hands crossed on his chest , a weak smile on his lips . " Well , now , I suppose you 'd like to see Mark Adam . " Lydia nodded . " I 'll have him summoned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must ask whether your interest in him is solely because of his father 's death or because you have a parallel interest in our church . " Lydia was n't sure what he meant and told him so . " It 's a reasonable question , Miss James . After all , when you 've tried to serve God for years despite vicious attacks by those who do not share your faith and who feel threatened by it , you tend to become . . . how shall I say it , you become gunshy. "  | Lydia crossed her legs . " I 'm not threatened by your beliefs , Mr. Jewel . I 'm here because of my work with a Senate committee charged with the investigation of Senator Caldwell 's murder . Any personal interest in your church , if there were any , would be based on curiosity . " " You 've read the untrue things said about us , I presume , heard them on television . " " Some , yes . " " Arid ? " " And how have I responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the practices I 've heard about , the means of raising funds , the alleged control exerted over church members . " She almost said cult instead of church and was glad she had n't . She was also disappointed in herself that she 'd so quickly been drawn into a discussion about the cult in the first place . " I really would rather not discuss your church , if it 's all right with you . That 's not my purpose here . " " " But you will take away with you certain impressions of us . I think it only fair that I have an opportunity as the executive director to present a more balanced picture . . . Oh , here 's our tea . " It was poured from an elegant silver teapot into antique china cups . Lydia tasted the tea , nodded her approval . " I 'm glad you like it , Miss James . That will be all , Richard . " The young man left the room , closing a set of sliding doors behind him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fire , allow me to tell you a little about the Center for Inner Faith . I will tell you the truth . I hope you are ready to hear it . " " I 'm not sure it matters whether I am or not . " Twenty minutes later he 'd gone through what Lydia was certain was a canned speech , filled with positive images of The Center and its goals . He pointed out that cult members were in no way restricted in their movements . As long as they were faithful to the cult 's beliefs , he told Lydia , they were free , actually encouraged to mingle with the outside world and to carry their faith to others . Lydia realized that he was at least technically correct . . . members of the cult were often seen in town , handing out  | leaflets , stopping passers-by to tell their story and , of course , to solicit funds . Physically , at least some of them seemed free . The extent of mental control was another matter , which she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was only the administrative head of the church , and that its spiritual leader , the Reverend Sylvan Quarles , was the pivot point around which everything revolved . Lydia knew about Quarles from what she 'd read in the papers . He was in his late sixties , tall and charismatic , with a stentorian voice and flowery vocabulary , an impeccable dresser whose eyes , they said , blazed when he spoke . It was also said that he could mesmerize his audiences , although a psychiatrist friend had once explained to Lydia that the real power was within the listener . This psychiatrist used hypnosis in his practice for behavior modification , for smoking and obesity , and told Lydia that each person had an inborn capacity to enter a hypnotic trance . The ones with a high capacity were most easily persuaded . They tended to suspend critical judgment , sur- ill render it , when confronted with an authority figure . 11 Throughout his lecture she nodded when appropriate , asked a few questions to clarify points even though she was n't inter-ested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish so that she could get to Mark Adam Caldwell . " Any questions , Miss James ? " Jewel asked as he finished his spiel . " Nom " This administrative center is one of four sanctuaries in Virginia . We have centers in eleven other states , and have recently opened them in Germany and France . " " That 's very impressive , and I might like to discuss it further 1 with you at some later date , but I do have a time problem today . Could I please see Mark Adam Caldwell now ? " Jewel went to the door , said something to the young man , who 'd kept a vigil in the hallway . Jewel returned to the desk and , moments later , Mark Adam entered the room . He wore the same sort of robe worn by the other young man , except that his was freshly laundered and ironed .  | " Hello , Mark , " Lydia said , standing . His face was blank as he took two steps toward her , extended his hand and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , Mark , " Jewel said . The boy took a chair on the opposite side of the desk and stared straight ahead , past jewel and out a window . " I told you that Miss James wanted to speak to you , " Jewel said , " and I agreed that she could . I 'll be here with you all the time . " It appeared to Lydia that Mark Adam was either drugged or in some unexplained state of altered consciousness . She felt as though she 'd entered a mental institution and was visiting a patient . " How are you ? " she asked Mark . Slowly he turned his head and looked at her , as though to get a fix on her identity , then said in a near-monotone , " I 'm very well , thank you . I 'm very happy . How are you ? " " I 'm fine , Mark . It 's good to see you again . " He returned his attention to the window . " Mark , are you feeling well ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jewel said . " He 's found an increasingly close relationship with God and serves him with all his spirit . Is n't that right , Mark ? " " Yes . God gives me the day and night , and I use them for his glory . " Lydia cleared her throat , opened her briefcase and pulled out a yellow ruled legal pad on which she 'd written the questions she wanted to ask . " Mark , as you may know , I 've been appointed special counsel to a Senate committee to investigate your father 's murder . That 's why I 'm here . You 'll be called to testify before the committee sometime in the near future , but I wanted to have a chance to talk with you first . You do n't have to , you know . If you 'd like , you can ask for a lawyer to be with you whenever you say anything about your father 's death . " " I know that . " " He said it with more animation than before ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jewel said , " and he realizes his rights . We have his best interests at heart here . We 're all one large and loving family . "  | Lydia ignored Jewel . " Mark , do you know anyone who might have wanted to kill your father ? " He shook his head . She hesitated , then asked matter-of-factly , " Did you want to see him dead ? " His face again took on a hint of animation . He looked directly at her . " No . " " You said things to the police , Mark , that might be construed as being . . . well , as being hostile toward your father . Would you agree that you felt anger toward him ? " " Of course he did , " Jewel said . " Mark Adam 's father was hardly what you would call a decent God-fearing man . " " Mr. Jewel , I 'd appreciate it if you would allow Mark to answer the questions himself . Having you here is one thing , answering for him is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small nose to an even finer line . One finger stroked his cheek as he prepared to speak . Lydia did n't wait . She went back to Mark and asked , " Do you understand why I 'm asking these things , Mark ? I 've been a friend of your family for years and I want to help in any way I can . I also have a duty to attempt to get to the truth . I 'd like to find that truth without hurting those people I care about , and you 're one of them . " " No one cared about him until he came here , " Jewel said . Again she ignored him . " Mark , some people think that Jimmye 's murder might , in some way , shed some light on your father 's death . What do you think about that ? " Jewel raised up in his chair . " Really , Miss James , is it necessary for such cruelty ? The boy has lost his father as well as a sister . . . to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Mark , I ask you again , do you think that Jimmye 's ? " " Jimmye was a harlot , a Messalina hetaera . " " What ? " " She sinned and was punished . It 's as it should be . " " She was like a sister , Mark . " " She was a sister of the Devil , " he said in his near-singsong voice . " She gave her body to the Devil . " He shifted in his seat  | and placed his large hands flat on the desk . The thick , muscular body beneath the robe began to tremble . " Those who sin against the Father must be punished . " Or with the father ? she could n't help think to herself .. . " I think this has gone far enough , " Jewel said . He patted Mark 's forearm . " I do n't think Miss James has any further questions for you , my son . You can return to your duties . " " No , I 'm not finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he attended his father 's party after so many years of estrangement . I 'd like to know about Jimmye and his relationship with her . I 'd ? " But Mark Adam had already stood up , turned and left the room . " I resent the way this has been handled , " Lydia told Jewel . " The boy seems in another world . What have you done to him ? " " We have given him peace and hope , something you probably would n't understand , Miss James . He came from a family of sinners , rich and powerful people who abused their position here on earth , who defied their God every day of their lives . Here Mark Adam is with those who shun the secular , the materialistic , the sins of society . Here , Miss James , he can fulfill his Father 's wishes for him . " " His father is dead . His father has been murdered . " " Good day , Miss James . " She placed her materials in her briefcase , zippered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrutiny of the armed young cult member . She drove back to Washington as quickly as possible , stopped in at her private offices , where she was filled in on developments during her absence , dictated a sheaf of letters into a recorder while she munched halfheartedly on a chicken salad sandwich delivered from a local luncheonette , called Clarence but did n't find him at home , then finally called her committee office in the Senate . Rick Petrone answered . " How 's everything ? " she asked , her mouth half-filled with chicken salad . " Where have you been ? "  | " I 've spent the morning with crazies , I 'm sorry to say . " " Looks like Ginger spent an evening with one . " " What do you mean ? " " She was mugged and robbed last night ? " " What ? My God ... is she all right ? " " A concussion . She 's at Doctors Hospital . They say she 'll be okay . The guy hit her over the head and stole her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her car . " " Good Lord , I 'll be there in an hour . Will you be there ? " " I 'll hang around . " " Any calls ? " " A dozen or so . Where were you this morning ? " She briefly told him of her trip to the cult headquarters . " You ought to stay away from places like that . " " I 'm sure you 're right . See you . " Twenty minutes later Senator Wilfred MacLoon walked into Veronica Caldwell 's Senate office , closed the door behind him . " This whole situation with Lydia James is getting out of hand . She thinks she 's Sam Spade and Sherlock Holmes rolled into one . " Why do you say that ? " MacLoon , briefed by Rick Petrone , told her about Lydia 's trip to cult headquarters and her interview with Mark Adam . Veronica 's lips tightened . " All I can say , Will , is that if I 've made a mistake in pushing for Lydia James to be special counsel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather thought I 'd gotten through to her that ? " " What did you tell her ? " " Oh . . . just that the committee has a limited function and that all other aspects of Cale 's death are the business of the MPD . " " Evidently she does n't listen too well . " " I 'll speak with her again . " " Please do . I want this committee to be out of business within a month , and it never will be if I have to put up with her nonsense . By the way , did you hear about that researcher on her staff , Ginger Johnson ? "  | " No " MacLoon told her what Rick Petrone had reported . " Well . . . I certainly hope she 's all right . " " Oh , they say she will be . . . I have n't had lunch yet . Today 's Oregon Day . They flew in salmon steaks . Join me ? " " I 'd love to . Thank you , Will . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The doctors told her she 'd suffered a concussion and was to spend a few days in bed . She protested but Harold insisted that she follow their orders . Reluctantly she crawled into bed while he went to the kitchen to heat up a can of tomato soup . When he came back to the tiny bedroom , she was on the phone with Lydia . " You 're not supposed to talk , " he said in a loud voice . She held up a finger to silence him , then said to Lydia , " I 'm feeling okay , I guess . I just called to see what was going on . " " Nothing that ca n't wait . The important thing is for you to get some rest and come back to work fit as a fiddle . One thing , though , before I hang up . What about screening Quentin Hughes 's videotape of the Cale Caldwell interview ? " " Oh , right . He says we can come to the studio to see it . " " Okay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what Harold says , and if you need anything , just yell . " " I will , Lydia , and thanks . " Lydia 's call to WCAP-TV was taken by Hughes 's producer , Christa . Lydia explained what she wanted and Christa told her she 'd check with Hughes and get back to her . An hour later she did and suggested that Lydia come to the station at five that afternoon ... . After waiting ten minutes in WCAP 's reception area , Lydia was escorted by Christa to a small editing room in the building 's basement . Waiting there were Quentin Hughes and a young woman who , although not introduced , was obviously a tape editor familiar with the room 's dazzling array of electronic equipment . Hughes barely acknowledged Lydia . " Ready ? " " Yes . "  | " Go ahead , " he told the editor . She pressed some buttons and two TV monitors came to life . A half hour later the videotape came to an end with Hughes saying goodbye to his viewers and thanking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " Hughes asked Lydia as the lights came on and the monitors went to black . " Yes , thank you . It was so . . . sad seeing him there on the screen , so vibrant and alive ? " " Yeah , well he is n't that now . " " No , he 's not . I may want to see it again . That will be possible , I assume . " " Yeah , I guess so , give a call . " She got up and Christa returned her to the reception area on the main floor . " If there 's anything else I can do to help you and the committee , Ms. James , please let me know , " Christa said . " I mean that . " As they said goodbye Lydia asked , " Were you there during the taping ? " " Yes , of course . Why ? " " Oh , nothing . There were some things about Senator Caldwell 's actions , his appearance , that seemed . . . well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't recall anything unusual , " Christa said . " Probably just my imagination . Well , thanks again . I appreciate it . " " Anytime . " She drove directly to her Senate committee office , flicked on a tape machine and was about to dictate her thoughts about the interview she 'd just seen when Veronica Caldwell knocked , opened the door and stepped inside . Lydia placed the microphone in its cradle . " Hello , Veronica . What a nice surprise . " " I was just getting ready to leave and thought I 'd stop in and see how your researcher was doing . I heard about it and was shocked . How is she ? " " Doing well , I spoke with her today . She 's home and resting . "  | " Thank God . And how are you ? " " Busy . . . I 'm just back from WCAP . I saw the interview Cale did with Quentin Hughes . " " Oh ? Why ? " " Curiosity , in part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . . . This will sound foolish , I guess , but one thing that struck me ... it was the first time I 'd ever seen Cale less than impeccable .... " " What do you mean ? " " Well , he fiddled the whole interview at a nonexistent button on his shirt collar . Not like Cale to show up anywhere , let alone a TV show , like that ... " " Really ? " " Yes . . . for him to go to a TV taping with a button missing on a button-down shirt " Oh , but he did n't . " " What ? " Veronica laughed . " Of course not . I remember that day very well . He 'd just received a new shipment from Wendley in New York . He always ordered his shirts from them , they kept his measurements on file . He was so fond of their shirts , especially the button-down ones . He said he liked the slightly higher collar they had . Anyway , the day he went to tape Quentin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I distinctly remember because he was showing it off to me . As they say , he had all his buttons . " Lydia laughed too . " Well , he lost one of them before the taping . So much for that . . " I understand you paid Mark Adam a visit ... " " Yes . " " How was he ? " " Fine , he . . . oh , why am I saying fine ' ? I was shocked at what I saw . He seemed to be drugged , or under some other sort of control . Frankly , I was appalled . " Veronica 's face hardened , she fidgeted with her purse . " I know it must be dreadful for you to know the situation he 's put himself in . I 'm so sorry . . . " She forced a smile . " You can never tell about children , Lydia . You bring them up , give them  | all you can and do your best . Then they become adults , and , well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own way . . . Fortunately Cale , Jr. , took a different direction . He made his father very proud . " " He must have . . . I 'm hesitant to bring this up , Veronica , but I might as well take advantage of your being here ? " She held up a gloved hand . " From the way you said that , I think I 'd rather not be here . " Lydia stifled an urge to ignore what was on her mind , but she pushed on . . . " I understand there was a personal problem of some sort between Jimmye and Mark Adam . " Veronica seemed to ignore her . " What was the problem , Veronica ? " " Lydia , I have no idea what you 're talking about . " " I ca n't believe that , not after what Mark himself said about her . Please , Veronica , it might put some light on what happened to Jimmye and to Cale . I 'm not just prying , have never meant to . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood . " I 've made a great mistake in trusting you , Lydia . I resent the inference in what you just asked me . " Lydia 's early embarrassment was evaporated in her own rising anger , not just at Veronica but at the whole frustrating experience since she 'd joined the committee . They gave her a responsibility , then the same people who 'd given it seemed hell-bent on keeping her from carrying it out . Now , as Veronica got to the door and was about to open it , she decided to go all the way . . . " And what about Cale and Jimmye ? " Veronica stopped , turned slowly . " I 've had enough , you 've really gone too far . For reasons best known to yourself , you 've twisted everything decent about my family to satisfy some extraordinary need that I never dreamed existed in you . You 've taken a public trust and betrayed it , made a scandal sheet assignment of it . I assure you you will no longer be in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Lydia sat there , stunned . She dug her fingernails into the palm of her hand . How could you ? Never before in her life had she acted so impetuously , spoken with such disregard for an-  | other person 's feelings . She 'd been totally out of line . Veronica 's reaction was right and to be expected . She considered going after her to try to apologize but did n't . She 'd wait a day , then call .. . Sleep did not come easily that night , and she woke up the next morning feeling groggy and very out of sorts . She was due at the MPD to review the Jimmye McNab file and now was tempted to cancel the whole thing . After last night .. . She wrapped a robe around herself , put on the teakettle and went to the front door , where the Post would be waiting . She tossed it on the kitchen table and took a shower , finishing off with very cold water to clear her head . She removed the whistling kettle from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she sat at the table and opened the folded paper to its first page , her eyes focused on the top , heavy headlines . But then she noticed a small box at the bottom of the page , with a headline that read : BREAK REPORTED IN CALDWELL MURDER . The article jumped to an interior page , but the paragraph and a half on page 1 gave the essence of the story . A major break in the unresolved ice pick murder of Senate Majority Leader Cale Caldwell was reported last night by Deputy Chief of Police of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department , Horace Jenkins . Jenkins made the statement during an informal press conference in his office . When pressed by reporters , Jenkins refused to elaborate , except to say , " The Caldwell murder has resulted in the most intensive investigation in this department 's history , and it looks like it 's about to pay off . " Chief Jenkins went on to discuss certain elements . cont. on page 22 The rest of the article simply recounted the events of Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the MPD . Surrounding Jenkins 's office were media people clamoring to talk with him . Lydia  | told one of the officers in the bullpen that Jenkins was expecting her . Moments later he came back to say , " He wonders whether you could come back this afternoon . " " No . " Some of the reporters came over to Lydia and asked her about the reported break in the case . " I know what I read this morning in the paper , that 's all , " she said . " Come on , Miss James , why are you here if you 're not in on it ? " " Believe me , I was as surprised as . . . " The young officer came out of Jenkins 's office for a second time and motioned for Lydia to go in . " Good morning , " she said . " Nothing good about this morning , kid . " " From what I read in the paper you should be celebrating . " " That 'll happen when the time comes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You said I could . " " Things change , you 're wasting your time . " Lydia sighed and sat up straight . " You know , chief , I 'm really getting very tired of people telling me that I 'm wasting my time . " " In a few days it wo n't matter anyway . " " Why ? " " Nothing . Look , this Caldwell thing is going to be over very soon . You can make book on that . There 's not going to be a need for any Senate committee because there wo n't be anything left to investigate . " " What is this so-called major break in the case ? " " I would n't tell you if my life depended on it . In fact , my life does depend on it . " He leaned across his desk , said conspiratorially , " Do you really think I 'd tell you , or anybody else , what we 've got ? Hey , Lydia , I may not be a genius but that dumb I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sharing credit for breaking it does n't hit me as very intelligent . " " You know who did it ? " " No comment . "  | " I 'm not with the media , I'm- " " Got to go , Lydia . " " When do you expect an arrest ? " " Soon , have a nice life . " " I 'm not leaving until I can see the McNab files . " " I told you to forget it . " " If you want , I 'll go outside and tell the press how the MPD has refused to cooperate with the Senate . I 'll tell them ? " " Do n't threaten me . I prefer to remember you as you were . Sorry , but that 's all the time I have . " Lydia picked up her purse and briefcase , and went downstairs and left the building . As she reached the end of the street , a car carrying four men turned the corner , just missing her . She stood at the curb and watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third to exit through an open rear door . A couple of reporters who 'd been hanging around the side entrance to the MPD approached the car . The driver jumped out and intercepted them . Moments later , the fourth man in the car slowly came through the door . He was handcuffed . The other two men grabbed his arms and led him toward the entrance . He turned and looked down the street to where Lydia stood , then looked up at the sky . The flesh at the rear of his shaved head and neck folded over the loose collar of his white robe . Before Lydia had time to mutter the name Mark Adam , he was whisked away from advancing newsmen and shoved through the door .  | LYDIA AND Clarence , sitting on a couch in his apartment , stared at the television screen as the anchorman came on and said , " The top story tonight is a confession in the Senator Caldwell murder . Back with details after this " Rousing , dissonant march music , the newscast 's title and subtitle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then : " Good evening , I 'm Richard Bourne . A confession today in the ice pick murder of Senate Majority Leader Cale Caldwell . In an announcement at MPD headquarters this morning , Deputy Chief of Police Horace Jenkins had this to say ... " Jenkins was seen seated behind his desk , surrounded by reporters , reading from a piece of paper in front of him : " Mark Adam Caldwell , the older son of slain Senate Majority Leader Cale Caldwell , has confessed to his father 's murder . He is in custody here ... " A rush of questions . Jenkins held up his hand . " There 's nothing more I can say at this moment , ladies and gentlemen . The resolution of this murder has resulted from a painstaking and thorough investigation by this department . It 's a sensitive case , and everyone concerned with it is determined to protect the integrity of the investigation and the rights of the accused . " The anchorman took over . " Sources close to the investigation have informed us that the younger Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive for having murdered his father derived from a long-standing personal problem within the Caldwell family . " Followed by a commercial . " Clarence , it just ca n't be ? " " Why not ? " " It 's too . . . it 's just too simple , too pat . And if Mark Adam  | did kill his father , why confess to it ? Or why wait until now ? No , I ca n't buy it . " " Well , I do . Murder will out , it 's over , and now you can go back to making more time for me . . . for us . As you know , I 'm a very selfish person . " She managed a smile , put her arms around him  --  and the phone rang . Clarence answered , shrugged and held out the receiver for Lydia . " Hello , " she said . " What about Jimmye McNab ? " A female voice . " Who is this ? " " Do n't believe what you hear . " The line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't recognize her voice ? " " No . But it sounded like she was trying to disguise it , make it sound deeper . " Clarence gave her a sidewise look and put on a recording of harpsichordist Wanda Landowska playing Bach 's dance suites . " Landowska to the rescue . Stop thinking and listen . " Lydia sighed , leaned back and closed her eyes as the slightly twangy , mandolin quality of the harpsichord filled her ears and touched down to her soul . After a while she said , " Clarence , I 'm exhausted , drained , like somebody pulled a plug . I want to go home , hit the old sack . I 'm sorry ... " She did n't immediately move to leave the comfort of the couch , and he reached over and stroked her hair , her forehead . " Such deep , dark thoughts , " he said softly . " Your forehead is a mess of furrows . " " I suspect it will be for quite a long time . " She turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder , Clarence , when we talked about crime in terms of the cycle of fifths ? " " Sure . Like a piece of music , murder has resolved itself too . It started in the key of C and has returned there , to the tonic chord . "  | She smiled and stood up . " Unless we 've reached a Cseventh . " " Do n't get smart . " " A C-seventh , instead of just C. Once you add the seventh to a chord , it stays up in the air , suspended , looking for its own tonic . He stood up to and put his hands on her shoulders . " If it is a C-seventh instead of the tonic C , that means it goes into another key . " " Exactly . It could resolve to F and the piece will be over . Then again the C-seventh might only be the second chord in a new key we 're playing in . " " And if that 's true , the Caldwell Sonata ' could have a long way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what frightens me , Clarence . I was listening to one of the cassettes you bought me . The tune was Mack the Knife , ' and the group took twelve choruses on it , playing each one in a different key . They started in C , went up a half step each time until they eventually returned to C. " " And ? " " And I think Mark Adam 's confession is only one half step toward a long series of key changes . " " I wo n't argue with you , " he said as he helped her on with her coat . " I 'd rather make love , but you do look exhausted . Sure you do n't want to stay ? " " Thanks , yes . . . but also no . I 'll call you in the morning . " All the way home she thought of the phone call and the unidentified woman 's reference to Jimmye McNab . The thoughts stayed with her as she sat in the tub and enjoyed the warm , sensuous feeling of muscles relaxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown monk 's robe that reached the floor and turned on the television . She fell asleep , waking as the eleven o'clock news came on . She rubbed her eyes and tried to focus on the screen . The first words out of the anchorman 's mouth jolted her upright and to the edge of the couch . " Extraordinary developments this day , ladies and gentlemen , in the Cale Caldwell ice pick murder . Not only has the  | deceased senator 's elder son , Mark Adam Caldwell , confessed to his father 's death , but we have just been informed that he has also confessed to the murder of journalist Jimmye McNab . McNab , you might recall , was not only one of Washington 's most respected television reporters , she had also been brought up by the Caldwell family from infancy . I 'll be back with more details in a moment . " The phone rang . It was Rick Petrone , aide to Senator Wilfred MacLoon . " You 've heard ? " " Yes . I 'm shocked . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like a meeting of the Caldwell committee at nine . Can you make it ? " " Yes , of course . By the way , have you heard from Ginger ? " " She called , says she 's feeling fine . She 'll be in in the morning . " " I think she should take more time to rest . " " There 'll be plenty of time for that now . " " What do you mean ? " " The Caldwell murder has been solved by the MPD , there 's no need for a committee . " " I 'm not so sure . " Okay , Lady Hawkshaw , have it your way . See you at nine . " The meeting was held in a large committee room a few doors down from Wilfred MacLoon 's offices . Lydia was surprised that in addition to the regular members of the committee and selected staff members , Veronica Caldwell and Deputy Chief of Police Horace Jenkins were there . She told Veronica that she had n't expected to see her . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . It seems you were right , that there was a connection between Cale 's and Jimmye 's . . . " And then she turned away , to hide her upset , Lydia assumed , at this awful news about her firstborn son . Lydia hesitated , then caught up with her just inside the committee room door . " Look , Veronica , I apologize for some  | of the things I 've said and thought , but I 'd like to say something else that you may welcome hearing ? " " Then for God 's sake say it . Say it and go back to your comfortable little law practice and leave me and my family alone . " " I do n't believe Mark Adam did what he 's confessed to . " " I wish it were true ? " " I know you do . " She touched Veronica 's arm . " Do n't just accept this , Veronica , for your sake and for your sons . You demanded a committee to get to the bottom of things . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might not be true . He 's not a well person , Veronica , not responsible . At least you could . . . " " That 's enough , Lydia . On top of everything I do n't need your amateur analysis of my son . " She turned and walked off to where some committee members stood , leaving Lydia feeling very much alone . When she returned to the site of the meeting , Wilfred MacLoon had just arrived and had taken his place at the head of the conference table . Others settled into chairs . Lydia sat at the far end of the table , between Senator Jack Markowski and Horace Jenkins . MacLoon lit a fresh cigar , opened a file folder , glanced around the table . " Glad everyone could make it this morning . I 'd especially like to welcome Senator Caldwell and Deputy Chief Jenkins . I 'm sure we all share the grief our colleague , Senator Caldwell , has suffered . The only bright spot is that finally the pain of all this will be alleviated by putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a media circus . " He looked down the length of the table at Lydia . " Now , let 's get down to business and do what we all agree must be done . Because the MPD has done its job , two murders have been solved . I congratulate the MPD and you personally , Chief Jenkins , for an exemplary piece of law enforcement . " " Thank you , " Jenkins said . Nuts to you , Lydia thought . MacLoon continued . " Chief Jenkins and I conferred last night , and the upshot is we 're convinced  --  I know how this  | must pain you , Veronica  --  that the confessions will hold up . Is that correct , chief ? " Jenkins cleared his throat , rubbed his eyes . " That 's correct , senator . " He looked unhappily at Veronica Caldwell . " I hate to even talk about this thing with Mrs. Caldwell sitting here , but I suppose the fact that she is here shows what kind of woman carries the Caldwell name . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , his voice faltering as he wondered whether he was putting it in the right words . " Thank you , " Veronica said . " You are right , this is very painful and distasteful , but I 've assured Senator MacLoon that it is my job not to let personal feelings interfere with . . . justice . I 'll overcome the personal impact of it in the interest of seeing that I do my job . . . I love my son very deeply and I tell you now I will do all I can to help him , defend him .. . He 's a troubled young man , and regardless of what he has done . . . my love for him remains . I 'm sure you understand that . " Jenkins cleared his throat . " Like I said , this woman is incredible . " He turned to MacLoon . " The young man 's confession is complete for both homicides , and his rights were protected every inch of the way , so there 's no chance of ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Her question caused everyone to turn and to look at her . Jenkins answered her question in a voice that unmistakably reflected his annoyance . " Of course , " he said . " Who ? " " His brother . " " Cale , Jr. ? " " That 's right . He plans to retain other counsel for his brother in due time , but he was there the minute we went down to the cult and picked up his brother . Like I said , the accused 's rights were protected every inch of the way , not only by a qualified attorney but by his own brother . " Jenkins concluded his statement with an assurance that not only had Mark Adam confessed , he 'd given every detail of both murders that had not , in any way , conflicted with known facts . Rather , they 'd confirmed them .  | MacLoon said , " It 's my suggestion that we immediately conclude this committee 's business and issue a public statement to that effect . " Silence , until Senator Markowski put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will ? After all , the suspect has n't even been indicted yet , let alone tried and convicted . " He looked at Chief Jenkins . " With all due respect , chief , simply having someone from the MPD proclaim that the murder we 've been charged with investigating is solved is n't , it seems to me , sufficient reason for a Senate committee to fold up and go home . " " I disagree , this is n't a court of law ? " " Senator MacLoon , " Markowski pressed on , " the Dallas police solved the murder of Jack Kennedy , did n't they ? But that has n't precluded Congress from conducting continuing investigations into it . " MacLoon chewed on his cigar , glared at his younger colleague . " If somebody else wants to come along later and make up another committee , that 's their business . As far as I 'm concerned , this committee 's business is finished . " " As special counsel to this committee I must agree with Senator Markowski , " Lydia said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for the American people we 're supposed to represent is to continue our work until there is a conviction . At that time , after listening to the complete report of the MPD and examining the trial record , we can determine that no branch of government was involved , nor any member of government . " " Miss James , it should make you feel better to know that your insistence that there was a connection between Senator Caldwell 's murder and Jimmye McNab 's has been proven right . With that victory in your portfolio , perhaps we can all get on with more pressing matters . " " I resent that , senator . Not your manner , which is irrelevant , but your implication that I 've been after victories , personal vindication . That is inaccurate and I think you know it . So , as you say , let 's get on with more pressing matters than sarcasm and cheap shots . " " " A pretty speech , Miss James . Too bad there 's no jury . " He shifted his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad-  | vice of counsel aside , I advise that we begin to close down this committee 's activities . Naturally , a report must be written to satisfy the charter under which we 've been operating . That report can be written in conjunction with Chief Jenkins and his people . " " I do think , " Jack Markowski said , " that we at least should move slowly enough to keep pace with the MPD 's and the court 's prosecution of the case . I agree with you that there seems little value in having the entire committee continue to function , but the staff , under Lydia 's direction , should stay in place for a while . " Another senator who 'd remained impartial throughout the countless internal debates within the committee said , " I think Jack is right . I 'm all for folding up , but if we do it too quickly we 'll end up with the same second-guessing and sniping as happened with the Kennedy assassination . Let Miss James and her staff begin to prepare a report based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cooperate with her . " His comment took Jenkins by surprise . He looked around , checked Lydia for a reaction , then said , " That 's right . Always happy to cooperate with the Congress . " Lydia raised her eyebrows and slipped her notes into her briefcase . Jenkins intercepted her outside the conference room and offered to buy her a cuppa . " Thanks , no , " she said , looking at her watch . " Come on , I 've got something I want to talk to you about . " He drove to a nearby coffee shop and they settled into a booth . " All right , chief , what ? " " I meant what I said in the meeting . " " Okay . And . . . ? " Jenkins shrugged , drank his coffee and said into the cup , " I just wanted you to know , Lydia , that there are no hard feelings . Now that I 've cleaned this thing up , you 're free to do the job you were supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a report to the American people . " A tinge of sarcasm in his voice ? " Which is what I intend to do . "  | Jenkins finished the contents of his cup , sat back . " There 's going to be things come out of the indictment that probably should stay between friends , if you get my drift . I 'm talking about personal things , family matters . The point is that you 'll hear about some of them and be tempted to put them in your report . " " And you 're telling me that I should n't ? " " Suggesting it . I do n't think anything is to be gained by dragging out family dirt , even for the American people . " Lydia dabbed at her mouth with a paper napkin and grabbed the handle of her briefcase . " Calm down , " Jenkins said as she slid to the edge of the booth , reached across the table and took her wrist . " What are you so sore at ? You act as though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad at the world it did n't come out like you wanted . . . " He glanced around the coffee shop , then leaned over the table . " If you want some juicy gossip , Lydia , I 'll give it to you . Frankly , I did n't figure you got off on that kind of thing . " Do n't , she told herself , rise to the bait . Stay in the game . She took a breath , affected a smile and returned to the center of her seat . " All right , I 've calmed down . " She expanded the smile , which brought one from him . " This , " he said , " has nothing to do with your report , although I suppose it would n't hurt anybody to add it . Caldwell was going to die anyway . " She cocked her head . " What do you mean ? " " Well , you know that the autopsy on him was sealed at the family 's request . He had cancer . " " How bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured he had maybe six months . " " Did Senator Caldwell know he had cancer ? " she asked , not so much of Jenkins but of herself . He shrugged . " Could be . It really does n't matter , does it ? " " I suppose not . " She spent a few moments lost in her own thoughts . Finally , she said , " It 's interesting how the Caldwell family tends to pull strings where autopsies are concerned . "  | " Why say that ? I do n't blame the family for not wanting details played out in the scandal sheets . " " I was n't referring to the senator 's autopsy , Horace . I was talking about the Jimmye McNab autopsy that never was . " She glanced up . He did n't respond , so she pushed further . " Why was n't an autopsy done on Jimmye ? " Jenkins motioned for a waitress to bring their check . " Why did Cale Caldwell prevent an autopsy on Jimmye McNab ? " " Who says he did ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do , and so do some other people . Why ? " He shook his head . " Yeah , Caldwell brought some pressure on the department to skip an autopsy . Why , you ask ? The way the story goes , the esteemed Senator Caldwell was , as they say , having his way with Miss McNab for quite a while . Who knows , maybe he even made her pregnant . But so what ? They 're both dead . If which elected officials were cheating on the side was important after he died or left office , there would n't be space in the newspapers for much of anything else . . . . " He dropped her off in front of the Senate Building . " Forget the McNab thing , Lydia . That 's really over now . Do your report nice and neat , take the bows and get back to making money . If there 's anything I can do , give me a call . As I said , I 'm always happy to cooperate with the U.S. Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Quentin Hughes show was in progress . Christa Jones noted that her boss was edgier than usual in his interview with his guest . It had been a trying day , although no worse than many other days of the recent past . She 'd been staying with Hughes in his Watergate apartment for a week , returning home during the day only to feed her cats and to get a change of clothing . The beginning of the week with Hughes had started smoothly enough ; in fact , the first few days found Hughes in as good a mood as she could remember . Of course , in the early phase of their relationship he was often relaxed and pleasant to be with . Those early days in Des Moines provided Christa with one of the most pleasant memories of her life .. . Her father had deserted the family when Christa was an infant . Her mother , an industrious , uneducated woman , had done what she could to provide a home for Christa and her two younger sisters , but the woman eventually buckled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd returned home , packed a few belongings and left Des Moines with a truck driver she 'd met only days earlier . Because there were no relatives , the three Jones girls were placed in a state home . Memory of life in that home could reduce Christa to immediate tears and terror . She 'd found a job and taken courses at night at a local community college ; she 'd always been an avid reader and found herself immersed in her classes , particularly those dealing with communications . Hughes , who 'd become the most successful and well-known broadcaster in Des Moines , lectured one evening at the college . It was , as they say , love at first sight for the orphaned Christa . She was enthralled with his sureness , his ability to  | spellbind anyone within listening distance , his tall good looks . When they 'd talked after class , his slate gray eyes seemed to bum right through her . He was power and authority . Until Quentin Hughes , Christa had never been particularly interested in how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at the college she found herself making a conscious effort to look better . She knew even then that she was attractive , tall and fair-skinned , with a figure full enough to encourage appreciative stares from men on the street . Now she did what she could to enhance her attributes , then went to the radio station where Hughes was employed , asked to see him , and to her surprise was immediately ushered into his office . He hired her on the spot to replace a young woman who 'd been his producer and was leaving to marry someone from another city . The pay was n't much , but that did n't matter to Christa . The job created many perks for her , to say nothing of the pride she felt at being inside the exciting world of radio and television . And , of course , there was the fringe benefit of being close to Quentin Hughes on a daily basis . She was a virgin when she took the job with Hughes in Des Moines . That lasted two days . Soon they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate apartment for , what he termed , " appearances ' sake . " She had n't argued , simply looked forward to when they would be together in a house he rented on the outskirts of the city , six blocks from the home in which he was born and where his mother still lived . Christa had assumed  --  presumed , Hughes would say  --  that one day they would be married . Hughes had been married before meeting her , and had gotten his divorce during the time they were together . Christa understood that to push him would be a mistake , and so she said little , dropping only occasional hints and hoping that he would respond to them . He did n't . He also occasionally saw other women and , to Christa 's shock , one day announced that he was marrying one of them . That time she stayed away from the station for a week , mostly in bed in her apartment . Eventually Hughes came to visit her ,  | and told her he needed a producer and if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't easy , but she went back to the station . Hughes treated her well , gave her substantial raises and seemed understanding of her occasional flip-outs that made her stay away from the job for a few days at a time . Of course , she was paying her dues to him for such minor indulgences . And so it had gone for all these years , Christa always there even as he went through his succession of women , marrying some of them , only sleeping with most of them , all during his rise in the broadcasting business to his present position in Washington . Not that Christa was monastic when he was n't available . She dated a variety of men , but always found something lacking in them  --  or in her .. . She knew it was a failing , but . . . the only close female friend she 'd ever had told her that she was throwing away her life by staying with Hughes , dancing attendance on him . Christa had to agree , but divorcing her emotions from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason , she had the notion that one day Quentin Hughes would realize the mistake he 'd made in not committing himself to her and would do something about it . She was too much like too many women  --  even in the socalled age of liberation . . . . She snapped out of her reverie and glanced at her reflection in the glass separating the studio from the control room . She knew she 'd been reverting back to her younger years when she 'd done so little to improve her appearance . Especially over the past year . At the moment her hair was disheveled . Her powder blue turtleneck sweater had a coffee stain over one breast . A black felt skirt was rumpled and covered with cat hair . She wore no makeup and noticed that a streak of black ink from a Flair pen was still on her hand after she 'd inadvertently picked up the pen by the wrong end almost two days ago . My God , Christa , you 're a mess . . . She considered taking a Valium from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills had become too much a part of her life . They were so easy to get . Always on hand were amphetamines and the depressants , Desoxyn and Plexonal , always something to pick  | her up from the depths or to bring her down from the heights . There had been other drugs , too , that Hughes occasionally enjoyed using recreationally , particularly to enhance his sexual pleasure . They 'd done nothing to Christa , although she never argued with him when he insisted that she share his use of them . And there was alcohol . As much as she knew how dangerous it was to combine drugs and alcohol , she 'd been drinking more heavily than ever . In fact , she 'd gotten quite drunk two days ago and had gone through a shaky , painful day-after . A recorded commercial , then Hughes 's voice through the intercom : " How about some coffee ? " Christa went to a small room , drew two cups and delivered them to the studio . " Thanks , babe , " Hughes said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for the rest of the show . " I have to feed my cats , " she told him as they stood together in the office and prepared to leave the station . " They 'll live . " " Just drop me off . It will take ten minutes and I 'll feel better . " " All right , " he said , tossing letters as fast as he could open them into an already overflowing wastebasket . They arrived at the Watergate , parked his car in the underground garage and rode the elevator to his floor . " Can I get you something ? " she asked after they were in the apartment . " No , thanks , " he said , kicking off his shoes and sprawling on the couch . " I think I 'll make myself a drink , " she said . " You drink too damn much , " he said . " No , I do n't . " ( Yes , I do . ) " Sure you do n't want one ? " He did n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gin over ice , returned to the living room and sat next to hint on the couch , drawing her feet up beneath her as she did . Hughes looked straight ahead across the large room . " What are you thinking about ? " " About you . "  | His comment pleased her . She touched his arm . " That 's nice to hear . Good thoughts , I hope . " He continued to stare straight ahead . Then : " I think it 's time for you to move on , Christa . " For a moment his words did n't penetrate . He turned , looked into her eyes . " Did you hear me ? I said , it 's time for you to move on . " Her laugh was purely nervous . She quickly took another drink of the gin . " Move on ? . . . what do you mean ? From my apartment ? . . . From here ? . . . " She knew damn well what he meant , was too terrified to acknowledge it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard as she tried to avoid his look she found herself drawn back to them like metal shavings to a magnet . " I mean really move on , " he said . " We 've been together too long , Christa . I think you ought to get out of the station , out of Washington . You 'll have no trouble getting another job in the business . I can arrange that with a phone call . " Her stomach knotted , she had difficulty swallowing the remaining gin in her glass . Often when they would fight she would be overcome with the same grip of inertia , nerve ends all activated at once and trying to propel her in a dozen different directions . She wanted to cry , to scream , to physically hurt him , to wrap her arms around his neck . She could do none of them . She went to the kitchen , where she filled her glass to the brim . She gripped the edge of the Formica counter and tried to stop herself from trembling . She drank , grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you doing ? " Hughes called from the living room . She came around behind him as he sat on the couch and used the back of it as a brace for her trembling hands . " Sit down , damn it , " he said , turning so that he could look up at her . She took a chair across a coffee table from him . He squinted . " We 've had a good long run , Christa . Everybody moves on at some point in their lives . " He moved to the edge of the couch and reached for her hand . She pulled it  | away . She knew what she looked like at that moment . She remembered her mother looking that way .. " Calm down , " Hughes said . I 'll see that you 're set up with one hell of a good job . I 'll also make sure that you leave here with plenty of money in your pocket ? " " You are a terrible person , " she said softly . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , do n't you know that ? " He placed his arm on the back of the couch , crossed his legs and jiggled his stockinged foot . " Love . That 's for kids , Christa . Grow up . " " I was a kid when I fell in love with you . " A large , immovable lump was in her throat . " I 've stayed all these years because of that love ? " " That 's your problem . I never told you to do it . I never promised you anything . It was your choice . I say it again , grow up , Christa . " She stood up and threw the contents of her glass in his face . " All right , damn you , I just have . " It took him a moment to recover from the shock . He shook his head , quickly got to his feet , pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his face . He was across the room in a moment , took her by the throat with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought the back of his hand sharply against the side of her face . He stood over her , forced her face up so that she was looking directly at him . " You 're sick , Christa . I 've been telling you that for a long time . You 're sick and need help . Do you want help from me , Christa ? Do you want me to see that you 're put someplace where they can help you ? " He , of course , knew all about what had happened to her mother . Nothing in her now except terror . She broke down , begged him to forgive her , not to tell her she was sick . He finally let go of her hair . She fell back on the carpet and stayed there , motionless , while he disappeared into the bedroom . He came back wearing fresh clothes . " I 'll be out for a while . I want you gone when I come back . Go home , get drunk , pop some of your damn pills and sleep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to the station I 'll have it all worked out for you , a new job , a new city , a new life . That 's the trouble with people like you , Christa , you ca n't tell the black hats from the white hats . I 'm doing this in your best interests , but you 're either too stupid or too sick to understand that . " He left the apartment , slamming the door behind him ... . Fifteen minutes later Christa Jones stood at the wide expanse of window overlooking the city of Washington , D.C. She 'd been standing there all that time , her mind a jumble , her breath coming in short spasms , her chest filled with the ache that had been there for so many years . She left the window and entered the bedroom , where she went directly to one of the closets that held Hughes 's extensive wardrobe . She got down on her knees and found what she was looking for on the floor of the closet , his fireproof storage vault . Quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator , removed a key from a nail , returned to the bedroom and opened the vault with the key . It was filled with papers , some cash , jewelry . None was of interest to her . She removed a package wrapped in brown paper , closed the lid , locked the box and returned the key to its hiding place behind the refrigerator . She put on her coat , looked about the apartment , then left . She hailed a cab outside and rode in it to her own small apartment , the package cradled on her lap as though it might have been a living thing . She locked the door behind her , took off her coat and flipped on the overhead lights . She was terrified . She drew a glass of water from the kitchen tap and used it to wash down another tranquilizer . An empty gin bottle stood in the sink along with dirty dishes . She found an almost empty bottle of cognac in a kitchen cupboard and poured what was left of it into a glass , then returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her telephone . She found a slip of paper on which a phone number was written , picked up the phone and dialed the number . She let it ring fifteen times before hanging up . Lydia James had just left her apartment on her way to an  | appointment with Cale Caldwell , Jr . She heard her phone ringing and debated going back to answer it . She did n't . " They 'll call back if it 's important , " she muttered to herself as she continued toward where she 'd parked her car . Christa Jones hung up the telephone . One of her two cats jumped up on her lap and meowed . The animal pressed against her and rubbed back and forth . From its throat came rumblings of contentment . Christa looked down and smiled . " There , there , babe , " she said as she petted the cat 's head . " There , there , now . Mommy loves you . Love ... "  | CALE CALDWELL , Jr. , had called Lydia earlier that morning and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . She had n't spoken with him since the night they 'd had drinks together at Hogate 's . Joanne Marshall , Cale 's secretary , was behind a receptionist 's desk when Lydia now entered the outer office . She stood . " Cale will be free in a moment , Miss James . Please take a seat . " Lydia sat on an antique church pew that was covered with red corduroy cushions . She took in the office and realized what an influence Veronica Caldwell had on her son 's tastes . The reception area had the look of an old schoolhouse . The wood on the walls was dark , and the floor was covered in a green carpeting in which scenes of early America were woven . There was a genteel calm to the room . Moments later Cale came through a door , smiled . " Come in , Lydia . I 'm glad you could make it . " Cale 's office looked much the same as the outside area , except that it was four times as large . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round conference table with four ladder-back chairs . Cale 's desk was massive and old . Burns along its edge testified to a previous owner 's habit of leaving lit cigarettes or cigars on it . Cale went to a window and looked outside . He turned , propped himself against the sill . " Lydia , I know you 're busy . I 've debated asking you to meet with me for quite a while now . What I want to talk to you about is n't pleasant , at least for me , but the more I thought about it , the more I realized that you were entitled to know what 's on my mind . " " That 's a turn of events , Cale . I was getting the feeling that  | the one thing I was not to have was information . From anyone . " " I can understand why you feel that way . It must have been rough . " He pushed away from the window and leaned against his desk . " It is n't all past tense , " Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm still involved . I suppose you know I 'm to write a report based on what the MPD comes up with . " " Yes . I 'm still his official counsel . I expect to have another attorney brought in within a few days . It 's a decision the family must make , Mark Adam 's defense . Some of the best legal minds in the nation would probably prove counterproductive . I think of the Patty Hearst case . F. Lee Bailey , brilliant as he is , was wrong for her , I feel . I think when an attorney becomes famous , juries often want to see him lose even before the trial begins . " Lydia agreed . His defense would apparently be based on legal insanity , and there were certain attorneys who could better present that plea to a jury than others . An awkward silence , broken by Caldwell . " One of the things I insist on with any counsel chosen for Mark Adam is that the entire matter of Jimmye 's murder be excluded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few people I 'll talk to about this , part of the arrangement made with the MPD had to do with that issue . It was the only consideration given us , but it was an important one . Mark Adam confessed to both murders in exchange for an understanding that Jimmye 's case would be closed without further examination . Actually it was n't much of a concession from , the police . Mark Adam is being charged with and tried for the murder of my father only . Solving Jimmye 's murder provides a bonus to the MPD . Lord knows , they solve few enough cases , and when they can close the door on one this easily , they 're damn pleased . " Lydia took a moment to digest what he 'd said . True , there was nothing so unusual about the arrangement . In multiple murders the accused was usually brought to trial for only one  | of them . Why then , she wondered , was she reacting with skepticism , even anger ? Perhaps because they 'd tried to dissuade her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . Caldwell continued : " I 've heard through the grapevine that you 're still interested in looking into Jimmye 's case . I honestly do n't know why you would want to do that , Lydia . It does n't make much sense . From what I can understand , the committee formed to investigate dad 's death is virtually out of business . The only thing left is for you to prepare a report . If you had any questions before about whether Jimmye 's death links up with my father 's , they should be truly a thing of the past now that Mark Adam has come forward . " She decided to be direct . " Cale , I ca n't come up with concrete evidence , but I simply ca n't accept Mark Adam 's confession . " Cale shook his head . " You 're an amazing person , Lydia . You wo n't let go of some notions , no matter what facts stare you in the face . Look , we 're family . Yes , we all wish that Mark Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish that he was a normal , rational human being . But that 's not the case . He 's seriously disturbed . It does n't take a psychiatric genius to come to that conclusion . The fact is , he killed our father out of a long-standing hatred for him . A lot of young men dislike their fathers . A lot go through life coping with it one way or another . Mark Adam , sad to say , was n't able to do that . When he came to dad 's party and again had a chance to see the man he 'd built such a dislike for from his early teens , well . . . it was just too damn much for him . " Lydia started to say something , but he cut her off . " Lydia , think of how mother and I feel about forcing Mark Adam to attend the party . It had been a long time since dad and my brother had had any contact . We should have known better . But that 's Monday-morning quarterbacking , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drinks together if I knew why an autopsy had not been performed on Jimmye . " Lydia looked intently at him . " Yes , I remember that .. . Why do you bring it up again ? "  | " Because I know you will , Lydia , unless I give you enough reason not to . The only thing I feel will accomplish that is the truth . Fact is , I admire people who demand the truth , even if they are annoying . " He picked up a pencil and doodled on a fresh , clean lined yellow legal pad . " It 's true that the family brought pressure on the MPD to avoid an autopsy on Jimmye . Dad , because of his position in the Senate , was successful in that effort . " " Why ? What were you trying to hide ? " He pressed down hard on the pencil and drew a long slash across the page . The pencil 's point broke when it went off the edge of the pad and hit the desk . " Because . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant when she was killed ? " " My God . . . how awful ? " " For whom ? " He looked up at her . " She was carrying my brother 's child . " Mark Adam 's child ? Yes . . . not as Chief Jenkins had sordidly implied  --  but there was a Caldwell in Jimmye 's picture . She 'd concocted scenarios based on the few facts that had surfaced during the investigation , but mostly on hints and rumors . Never once , though , had she sexually linked Mark Adam Caldwell to Jimmye McNab . " But . . . he was in the cult long before Jimmye was killed , " she said . " How ? . . . " There was a pause as he played with the broken pencil , slapped it down on the desk , took out his pocket watch and looked at it , not as someone checking the time but almost as though it were an object in which he could hide . The watch still in his hand , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well go all the way . You 'll remember when we had drinks that I mentioned there had been a problem in the family that developed from my brother 's relationship with Jimmye . I suppose relationship ' is the appropriate word . Jimmye and Mark Adam had become involved long before he joined the cult . It was the sort of thing any family would try to sweep under the rug . Imagine the reaction inside a family like ours . Here 's a United States senator , and a wife who is one of the leading patrons of the arts in America . They take in an infant girl who 's related to the wife and bring her up as a daughter ,  | giving her every advantage , treating her as an equal to their two natural sons . What does she end up doing ? She ends up climbing into one of the son 's beds , not just once but on a regular basis . Lydia felt very sorry for Cale at that moment . His eyes asked for understanding , not only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having in putting it into words . He then moved into a long monologue , a sort of stream-ofconsciousness recall of the events in the Caldwell household that centered around the discovery that Jimmye and Mark Adam had been intimate . " You 've got to understand that Mark Adam is a very intense person . Sure , especially a young woman , might feel this was a dynamic quality , be drawn to it . And , sad to say , along with the pleasure of it , our Jimmye 's ambitions were not unreasonably keyed to the older , first-born Caldwell .. . " . . . I 'll never forget for the rest of my days that moment when mother walked into Jimmye 's room and saw them together in bed . God , Lydia , it was the beginning of a nightmare in our family ? " " What did your parents do ? Surely they must have tried to put an end to it . " " Of course . They counseled , pleaded , threatened  --  the works . There would be long stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family almost seemed to return to the normalcy it once had . But then it would surface again and all hell would break loose . " Lydia slumped in the chair . She could n't escape the mental images of the stocky , brooding Mark Adam Caldwell with Jimmye McNab . . . She 'd really not known Jimmye very well , though the occasions when they had been together had been pleasant , and Lydia recalled that each time she was quite impressed with the young journalist . No question , Jimmye had been an extremely beautiful girl  --  tall , slender and lithe . Her hair was more a mane , and she wore it loose , which gave her a hedonistic quality to men . Lydia also recalled that Jimmye 's ambitions were nearly as different as her appearance  --  not necessarily a bad quality ; in  | fact , it made her seem sort of disarmingly frank , honest . Veronica had wryly observed on occasion that Jimmye would undoubtedly become whatever it was she wanted  --  the top network anchorwoman in America , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talented and , above all , goaldirected .. . " It must have been an awful thing to live with , " Lydia said , and meant it . " It tore us apart , " Cale said . " I suppose every family is tested . Well , this was our supreme test . In a way , it showed that the Caldwell stock is a strong one . Lots of people I know would have folded under the pressure . " " What happened when Mark Adam joined the cult ? One would think that would have put an end to it . " " No . It seemed to have ended before that . Jimmye had left the house and was involved with other men . We still suspected that Mark Adam was seeing her on occasion , but nothing was ever said about it . Usually , brothers are close enough to share those kinds of secrets , but there was never any of that between Mark Adam and me . It was as though we were from two different worlds . Two very different people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in wondrously different ways in us . . . Of course , we could only speculate that the experience with Jimmye had , in some way , helped provoke the psychic break that led my brother to go for a life in a religious cult . Who knows what guilt he carried with him ? Whatever it was , it was enough to drive him to kill Jimmye  --  who I guess he came to see as some evil force he had to exorcise , or whatever their damn jargon is . " " What about Jimmye ? " Lydia asked . " Did n't she feel guilty about what had happened ? It would seem to me that a young woman in her position , having been taken into a loving family and treated as an equal to that family 's natural children , would have some sense of honor , some commitment to that family . " " I 'm afraid Jimmye was n't bothered by such restraints . We all loved her very much , and in her own way I suppose she loved us . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , but  | Jimmye 's ambition had crossed the line into ruthlessness . I do n't know whether you were aware of that . " " No , I was n't . Not to that extent . I knew that she was harddriving and determined to succeed , but . . . frankly , Cale , all of this comes as a shock . I 'm not sure I 'm able to absorb it all at this moment , put it into perspective . " " You may never be able to , Lydia . I have n't . " As Lydia prepared to leave his office , she asked him why he had decided to take her into his confidence this way . " As I said when you first came in , Lydia , the Caldwell family has been embarrassed and hurt enough by Jimmye 's actions . Mark Adam did obviously manage to see her again after joining the cult  --  or she managed it . He 's also told me that Jimmye threatened to go to our mother and father and demand cooperation ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Jimmye had crossed over the line to ruthlessness . Of course , my brother . . . not exactly stable .. . tragically overreacted . We 'd dealt with so many problems with Jimmye that this would not have been as monumentally important as he felt . I 've no doubt that that cult and its mysticism helped push him to the act too . Who knows , he may have seen himself not as the family savior but some kind of avenging angel . That cult helps them think in those terms , it seems .. . The point is , Jimmye is dead and my brother , God help him , killed her . There are very few people I 'd have shared all this with . . . I know it will stay with you . " His expression made the point that to violate his faith would not be taken lightly . She asked , " Does your mother know you planned to tell me this ? " He hesitated , then said , " Yes . And she approved . " " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had had an intimate relationship with Jimmye too ? I 'm sorry to ask but since we 're getting everything out ? " He threw his hands up into the air . " It 's nonsense , Lydia . It 's cruel gossip . I 'm not going to protest too much , because that will only add to it . No , the only Caldwell  --  and one is too many  --  who got involved was my brother . "  | Lydia stood , picked up her briefcase and took a few steps toward the door . She stopped , turned . " Thank you , Cale . I 'm pleased that you think enough of me to trust me with this . " He came around the desk and shook her hand . " Mother and I both felt that you deserved to know . And we have the ulterior motive of hoping , by this full disclosure , that you 'll agree there 's no need for any of this to become part of any further investigation or any report by your committee . " Lydia nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do . But she also did no more , quickly departing . After Lydia had left , Cale Caldwell picked up a private telephone and dialed his mother 's office number . " How did it go ? " " Just fine , mother . I think Lydia finally understands that there 's no need to expose our family secrets . She 's a friend , mother , and I believe a good one . " " Yes , I 've always known that , " Veronica Caldwell said . " I would never have considered her for the special counsel 's spot unless I at least had been confident of that . Well , thank you , Cale . I feel a little better . Maybe all of this will finally be over . " " It will , mother . You know , as I talked to Lydia , I felt a renewed pride in being a Caldwell . Something I caught . You . . . " His mother sighed . " That is , at bottom , all anyone has , Cale , pride in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , after Lydia had returned to her apartment , taken a long , leisurely hot bath and finally settled in to watch the late news on television , that she was able even to begin to sort out her reactions to what Cale Caldwell had told her . She did feel a sympathy for everyone involved , with the exception of Jimmye McNab . But now there was another reaction . She was about to give it equal time when the phone rang . " How are you ? " Clarence asked . " Confused . You ? "  | " Okay . I hope I did n't wake you . " " No , I was just thinking , which is n't recommended recreational exercise . " " Right . Well , I spent the afternoon at the health club . " " Sounds a lot better than the way I spent mine . " " Join up , Lydia ? Yoga , exercise , dance classes . . . tones up the muscles where they count , and so forth . " Lydia could n't stop her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " Hey , are you there ? " " Yes , I 'm sorry . I was just thinking of what you said about your club having dance classes . . . you know , I think it 's possible I 've been dancing all day . " He laughed , and she cut him off . " I mean it , Clarence . It just penetrated that I just might have been choreographed into a Caldwell ballet . Then again , all this unaccustomed life-and-death action may be making me into a paranoid . Maybe I should get me to a cult too . . " You do , sweetheart , and I 'll kill you . With love , of course . " " Good night , Clarence . I think you 've finally given me something to dream on . "  | " GET up , " John Conegli 's wife thundered from another room in their small tract house in Rockville , Maryland . He got up in stages , knowing he needed to be on time for his client this morning . Marie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said through a long yawn . " Out all night again ? " " Do n't start now , Marie . It was no different when I was on the force . " " When you were on the force you had days off . When you were on the force we got a steady check . So you had to get yourself kicked off the force and be a big-shot private detective . " He started to argue with her , then thought better of it . When he 'd finished dressing he asked , " How do I look ? " She turned from the sink where she 'd been scrubbing the baked-on remains of lasagna from a pan , narrowed her eyes and took him in . " You look tired . " " I am . If I did n't have this client meeting I would n't get up this morning . " She wiped her hands , came up to him and kissed him on the cheek . " You 'll kill yourself with no sleep . " " Yeah , I know , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss and felt much better now that he knew he would leave the house on a pleasant note . He had a lot of time to think during the long ride from Rockville to his destination in Virginia . He 'd only met the client once , and that was when he 'd initially been hired . At first Conegli had debated turning down the assignment . Ever since starting his own detective agency he 'd tried to operate under a  | set of principles . In fact , he 'd turned down the first case ever offered him  --  a wife who wanted him to bulldog her errant husband . " No matrimonials , " Conegli had told her . He took the next case that came through his door , however , a husband who wanted his wife followed . Somehow that was different , Conegli told himself . A guy had a right to a little on the side , but not a married woman . Besides , the rent was due on his tiny office , he needed the money . Soon he took most anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was doing what to whom . This case was different . He 'd wanted to turn it down , but again money talked . He 'd asked for a fee far in excess of what he usually charged per day , and the client had n't batted an eye . He thought about his client and what he represented , and some of his initial misgivings returned as he continued south . As a cop , he 'd followed the basic rules : it was okay to take from prostitution , gambling and other pursuits that did nothing more than prey on man 's natural need for diversion . Who gets hurt ? was the way it was always put . Drugs were another matter , however . Every cop had kids of his own , and Conegli was proud that he 'd never taken a cent from a pusher . That 's why he considered his dismissal from the Washingtion MPD to have been so unfair . He 'd taken " clean " graft , which was more than some of those judging him could claim . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife did enough of that for both of them .. . He followed a narrow road through gently rolling farmland , then proceeded along Occaquan Creek until reaching a narrow entrance to the Center for Inner Faith . Some of the bald , white-robed members stood in front of the main house . " Bunch of weirdos , " Conegli mumbled to himself as he stopped his gunmetal gray sedan in front of the house . He struggled from behind the wheel , slammed the door and lumbered toward the house . He was intercepted by two young men who asked the purpose of his visit . " I 'm supposed to meet Mr. Jewel , " Conegli said , angry that he had to explain himself . He felt the heft of the .38 caliber  | police special he carried on his right hip and wished , for a moment , that he could use it . He was kept waiting in the foyer for ten minutes . Finally , a young man cane through the doors immediately to Cone gli 's right , quickly closed the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . Mr. Jewel will be detained for a few minutes . " He was led to a small , sparsely furnished office at the rear of the house , with one metal desk , three folding metal chairs and a row of battered file cabinets . The young man closed the door , leaving Conegli alone to take in his new surroundings . He went to the window . One pane was cracked and held in place with Scotch tape . An elaborate spiderweb spanned a set of dirty drapes . Conegli looked outside . There was considerable property in the rear . He saw members of the cult performing chores around the outbuildings . After some fifteen minutes , he angrily placed one of the chairs in front of the window and plumped himself down on it . He patted his suit jacket pocket , reached inside and pulled out a cigar , lit it , put his feet up on the desk and wished he were back home in bed , even with Marie . While Conegli waited in the rear office , Francis Jewel , executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult conversation with the cult 's founder and spiritual leader , the Reverend Sylvan Quarles . Quarles had arrived the previous evening and had stayed overnight . The discussion had begun immediately after the guru 's arrival and had lasted into the early hours until Jewel , exhausted , suggested they get some sleep and pick it up in the morning , which is what they did . ... he 's here now , " Jewel said to Quarles . " And I ask you again , Mr. Jewel , what he has accomplished besides taking our money ? " Jewel squirmed in his chair . The reverend stood larger than life in the center of the study . " We 're doing all we can , sir , " he said . " It 's imperative that we proceed slowly and carefully so as not to arouse suspicion ? " " Perhaps you 've been too careful and slow , Mr. Jewel , " Quarles said . " I sometimes wonder whether you truly under-  | stand the importance of this matter . You do understand , do you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape it would have severe and lasting consequences for our mission . " " Reverend Quarles , we 're investigating every avenue to recover the tape . I 've even gone so far as to send people to Iowa , where Quentin Hughes 's family lives . I expect a report within a day or two . We 've kept close tabs on everyone leaving or entering Hughes 's apartment . And , of course , we 've maintained a constant contact within the Caldwell family , as well as within Congress itself . You know that we have friends in high places , thanks , if I may say so , to my efforts . That , of course , was one of the reasons I encouraged the young Caldwell boy to join us in the first place . " " And look where that has gotten us , " Quarles said . He crossed the study , reached up to the top shelf of a bookcase and pulled down a copy of Jimmye McNab 's book on brainwashing and mind control . He returned to the desk , slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , Mr. Jewel . You should have anticipated the problems the Caldwell boy would bring with him , having a sister or whatever she was who is a journalist , having a father who is a member of the Senate . " " But that was the point , was n't it ? You told each of us years ago that for the church to survive in a hostile America we were to do everything possible to bring to our midsts those men and women who were in a position to help advance our goals . Certainly the Caldwell boy fit that critieria , did n't he ? " " It does n't matter now , does it , Mr. Jewel ? What you thought fit the criteria proved to be wrong . " Jewel winced . " Actually , we 've made strides toward solving this problem , have we not ? The boy is gone from here and has confessed to two murders , including the sister you spoke of who caused us so much grief . I 've no doubt that he will be found . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his days in an institution . No matter what he might say in the future , no one would give credence to it . " Quarles shook his head . " I 'm disappointed in you , Francis . You seem to spend your life making mistakes and then trying to find a bright side for them . It certainly has not helped our  | image to have one of our members confess to murdering his sister and his own father , who also happened to be Majority Leader of the United States Senate . " His voice , which had lowered , now rose . " Please , Reverend Quarles , I did n't mean that ? " " I am tired of having my mission on earth thwarted by incompetence . I must leave now to attend to other matters , Mr. Jewel . I will leave you with a message that I trust will not be misunderstood . I suggest you listen very closely to me . " He came to the desk , leaned on it and thrust his face close to Jewel . " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand that word , Mr. Jewel , but I understand it , and so does our God . Our God is a forgiving one , but he does not suffer incompetence easily . I assure you that if the tape is not found and in our possession by the time I return , you will be subject to the divine punishment you will have earned . " Jewel watched the self-chosen divine take up his cashmere overcoat from a coat tree , pick up his briefcase . He turned and asked , " Any questions ? ' " No , sir . " " Mr. Jewel . Good day . " It took Francis Jewel several minutes to recover . Finally he summoned one of the cult members and told him to bring Mr. Conegli to the study . After a proper blasting of Conegli , Jewel demanded : " Well , Mr. Conegli , where is the tape ? " Conegli crossed his legs , exposing a large expanse of white calf between where his pants leg ended and the top of an ankle-length black silk sock began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been doing everything I could , have followed up every lead you 've given me . I 've kept tabs on who comes and goes at Hughes 's apartment . You told me that you figured that redhead who works for the committee might have been given the tape so I took a shot with her , but that did n't work out ? " " And I was very displeased that you used violence with her , Mr. Conegli . You were told no violence unless absolutely necessary .  | " Violence ? That was n't violence . So I tapped her on the head , so what ? The kid is all right from what I hear , back to work and feelin ' fine . The point is that I 've followed up every lead you 've given me . I had the bug put in the piano teacher 's place like you said so we could get a handle on the James woman , but that has n't turned up anything yet . I might bug her place , too , but it 'll be tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let me know . " " Have you searched Hughes 's apartment ? " " That 's on my list . I figured I 'd take a look where the girl who works for him lives , and maybe even bug into James 's place . But I can only do so much . I 'm one man . If you want things to move faster , well , you 'd better up the budget so I can hire some help . " Jewel nodded grimly . " Yes , do what you must , spend what you must , but get the job done fast . " He thought of what Quarles had said . " Immediately . " " Okay , Mr. Jewel , but I 'm not about to lay extra money out of my own pocket . Besides , you owe me for last week . " Jewel wearily left the study , returning minutes later with an envelope containing two thousand dollars in cash . Conegli counted it , nodded his approval and put it in his inside jacket pocket . Conegli went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape that 's so damned important ? " " Mr. Conegli , I told you when you first asked that question that ? " Conegli held up his hands . " Okay , you do n't have to explain again . It 's just that in my business , you 've got to have ethics . I do n't like working on a case where I do n't know what the case is all about , if you follow what I mean . " " I follow , Mr. Conegli . And spare me your ethics . I want a call from you at least twice a day from this point forward . " " Sure thing , Mr. Jewel . " Conegli spent much of the drive back to Rockville speculating on what could possibly be on the videotape . As he pulled into his driveway it occurred to him that the tape might  | be pornographic , scenes of cult people frolicking in the buff . It brought a smile to his face as he pictured Francis jewel with a porn star . " How did your meeting go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay . " He remembered the envelope . " I got a bonus . " She opened the envelope he gave her and counted the cash . " We can use it . " " Not so fast . I need some of that to operate on . " " And we need a new refrigerator . How come the bonus ? " " Because I do such a good job . " " Who 's this client ? " " Makes no difference , Marie . . . now I want another bonus , " and he slapped her rear playfully . True love had its way . Francis Jewel dictated into a tape machine on his desk his recollection of what had occurred that day and the previous evening . He tried to recall in some detail the conversation with Sylvan Quarles , and also made comments into the microphone about what he had told Conegli . He flicked off the switch on the microphone . One name stuck in his mind . It was the name he 'd scribbled during the meeting with Conegli . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person now or to let it go until he 'd had further time to think . He picked up the phone and dialed . After three rings a voice answered , " Caldwell Performing Arts Center . May I help you ? " " Mr. Jason DeFlaunce , please . " Later that day , jewel received a call from one of two young cult members he 'd dispatched to Des Moines , Iowa . " It was n't there . " " You 're sure ? " " Yes . We went to the old lady 's house like you told us . No tape . "  | Jewel took off his glasses , rubbed his eyes . Then into the phone : " Come back immediately . " He placed the phone in its cradle , opened the bottom left drawer of his desk , reached beneath some papers and withdrew a Colt .32 caliber automatic pistol . He looked at it , hefted it , checked that it was loaded . He went to where his topcoat hung near the door and slipped the weapon into a pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The morning had dawned bright and clear , the temperature having moderated overnight , which caused Lydia to wonder whether spring was within striking distance . She considered the day to be a good omen for her return to a jogging regimen that had been important to her but that had slipped on her priority list since she joined the Caldwell committee . She was n't the only person who 'd headed for the Reflecting Pool that morning . There were at least twenty other joggers , men and women , old and young , their outfits a contrast in style and personal preference . Some wore garish shiny jogging suits . Others were dressed in drab sweat pants and sweaters . Lydia wore one of two jogging suits she owned , this one a royal blue outfit with a hood on the jacket , which she wore up that morning . She 'd finished four laps around the pool , decided to do an extra . She was halfway through it when another runner came up beside her . " Hi , Lydia , where have you been ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychiatrist she 'd been friendly with for some years . In fact , they 'd dated for a short time until he went the vocational route to matrimony and fell in love with a psychiatric resident . " What 's new in the shrink world ? " Lydia asked as they settled into a comfortable pace . " Nothing that Freud would approve of , " Sandy said . " Couches are being thrown out by the hundreds . Short-term is in . And you ? Do n't tell me , I read the papers . You 're a regular eeleb . " They ran in silence for a quarter of a lap before he asked , " Do you really think the boy did it ? " " Not sure , " she said . " You ? " He shrugged . " Seems unlikely , though I hear he had his  | strong motives . Still , to take seriously a confession from an acknowledged cultist . . They completed the lap and Sandy asked if he could give her a lift . " No , thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something before about not putting much faith in a confession from someone like Mark Adam Caldwell . Could you develop that a bit for me ? " " I 'll try . . . We 've been doing research for years now at Georgetown on mind control and brainwashing . Naturally the cults and the hold they seem to have over certain people have been a part of that research . In fact Jimmye McNab spent time with us when she was researching her book on the subject . There 's been a lot written about it ever since Korea but no one really has an answer yet . We 've been trying to correlate all the available research into one data center but it 's been a long , tough job . All the leading thinkers in the field have different ideas about what causes one person to fall easily under another person 's control while the next person is capable of resisting it . London and Spiegel in New York have one theory , Borne in Pennsylvania another . Researchers at Stanford have been looking at it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bottom line is that there are individuals who by virtue of their genes or upbringing or psychological set , or maybe all three , have a frighteningly enhanced capacity to be brainwashed . " " Do you think that Mark Adam Caldwell is one of those people ? " " The fact that he could so thoroughly commit himself to something as questionable as that cult would naturally lead me to believe that he 's a highly suggestible individual . Someone in a trance , an altered state , might confess to anything . . . You look skeptical . " " I guess I am , a little , " she said . " I can understand someone being suggestible and doing another 's bidding in certain situations , but to confess to a murder he has n't committed . . . God , that 's pretty extreme , is n't it ? "  | Sandy shrugged . " Do you remember the Reilly case in Con-necticut ? " She shook her head . " He was a young man accused of murdering his mother . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a full confession , which was the basis for his conviction . Arthur Miller , the playwright , got interested in the case and started a campaign to reopen it . He brought in psychiatric experts . After examining the kid and the circumstances of the confession , they came to the conclusion that he 'd literally been brainwashed , in this instance by the police . I 'm not suggesting that it was done deliberately , nor were they . The point is that if you take a highly suggestible person , and I 'm talking about someone who is at the extreme end of the scale , and place him in a pressure situation in which he 's faced with very imposing authority figures , he 's capable of slipping into a trance state as a defense against the pressure . Once he 's done that , he 's likely to go along with almost anything , including a suggestion that he did , in fact , murder someone . By the way , Reilly had a new trial and was acquitted . " " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who knows ? All I 'm saying is that I would n't be too quick to jump on the MPD bandwagon just because someone with the Caldwell boy 's known capacity to be controlled has admitted to a double crim ' " Would the psychiatrists brought in to examine him come to the same conclusion ? " He smiled . " Probably not . It 's nearly a dice roll . There are many psychiatrists who still hang onto the old analytic model , which does n't leave much room for this kind of testing and theorizing . They 're more apt to come up with a psychiatric evaluation based on Freudian principles , unresolved Oedipal conflicts , sibling rivalry , thwarted drives , id and superego clashes . Like I always say , Lydia , anybody looking for a therapist is involved in a real crap shoot . You ca n't tell the therapies without a scorecard . . . . " Home again , Lydia felt annoyingly confused as she sat in the kitchen and gazed out the window . Mark Adam Caldwell  | seemed to fit closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked to see Mark Adam examined by someone like Sandy , but she knew she did n't have the authority or influence for that . The family , the police , the public seemed to accept it ? not to mention the congressional committee . She moved to the living room . If it were true that Mark Adam had been brainwashed to confess to the murder of his father and Jimmye McNab , the question was , who 'd done it ? The MPD ? Horace Jenkins had certainly been under the gun to solve the murders . It would n't be the first time that a highranking police officer had forced a confession . No matter how she explored it , there was still the nagging fact that a young man , disturbed as he might be , was sitting in a jail and was about to be tried for two murders that he maybe did n't commit .  | Tim Loom , politician on whose behalf Senator Wilfred MacLoon had flown to Utah was sincerely appreciative of the senator 's support in his campaign for reelection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through MacLoon 's office whether he would make the trip and deliver a speech . The decision had been made at the last minute , which sent the local campaign staff into a flurry of activity to get the word out that MacLoon himself would make an appearance . " It means a great deal to me , senator , that you came back here to help me out , " the local man told MacLoon following the fund-raising dinner held in his honor . MacLoon slapped him on the back . " Hell , if we do n't help each other there wo n't be any of us left pretty soon . " Which brought a laugh from people who 'd gathered around him at the rear of the catering-house dining room . " Another drink , senator ? " someone asked . " Do n't mind if I do . " He 'd had a great deal to drink on his flight from Washington , and had continued imbibing throughout the dinner and a succession of preliminary speeches . The food , he 'd decided after a stab at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to have you back to the house for a nightcap , Will , " the local politician said . " Thanks , but I have some meetings scheduled at the hotel . " " Do n't know how you do it , senator , " an overly sincere middle-aged woman said . " I try , " MacLoon replied as he inched toward the door . He held up his hands to silence those still left in the dining room and took the opportunity to say in a loud voice , " One thing I promise every citizen of Utah  --  the missile system will be in this state . " Cheers trailed him as he left the room and went to where a  | driver stood outside a rented car . He got into the rear seat with some difficulty and drove off toward the comfort of his suite at the Little America Hotel on South Main Street . As he settled back and took in the passing sights of Salt Lake City he could n't help but think how two-faced some of his Mormon constituents were when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of Utah , which meant that all public restaurants and bars were prohibited from serving anything stronger than 3.2 beer . Things had loosened up recently , and certain restaurants were allowed to serve twoounce mini-bottles of cocktails , but only if the patron also ordered food . The fact was that there were probably as many heavy drinkers in Utah as in any other single state in the union . Only difference was that the drinking was done in private clubs and , like this evening , at political dinners held in such clubs . MacLoon also knew that there would be an ample stock of his favorite whiskey in his suite at the hotel . Ah , it paid to represent , no question .. . One of MacLoon 's Senate aides who had accompanied him to Utah had stayed at the Little America . He greeted his boss and immediately asked whether he could pour him a drink . " I need some food , " MacLoon said gruffly as he went to the suite 's bedroom to strip off his jacket and shirt and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweater that barely managed to button over the girth of the waist it had to span . " I 'll have something sent up , senator , " his aide said . " What 's your pleasure ? " " Whatever you can get fast at this hour , " MacLoon said . " Have you heard from Morgan and his people ? " " Yes , sir , " the aide said as he went to call in the order . " They called an hour ago and said they 'd be a half hour late . " " Figures , " MacLoon said as he settled in a chair and picked up a newspaper . " When they get here you 'll have to disappear . " The aide 's face reflected his disappointment in not being invited into the meeting . He 'd often been dismissed from rooms when the senator conferred with important people . He and an-  | other aide , Rick Petrone , frequently joked about what went on in meetings they were forbidden to attend , and they 'd come to the conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? came through a back door to attend to the distinguished lawmakers . MacLoon ate heartily and was almost finished when the desk called to announce his visitors . " Anything else you need before I leave ? " his aide asked . " Nope , but check in with me in a couple of hours . " " Yes , sir . " The aide had been trying to think of something to do with his time during the meeting and could n't come up with anything especially exciting . He decided to simply go to the bar , nurse a 3.2 beer and hope that some appropriate action came along ... . The two men who arrived at MacLoon 's suite were a study in physical contrast . The first through the door , Jedediah Smith , was tall and handsome . In his early sixties , although he could easily have passed for fifty , he had steel gray hair closecropped to a square head , face rugged , tanned and lined , like a veteran pilot who 's spent too many hours squinting into the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight swell of a middle-aged belly testified to his age . He was dressed in expensive western clothing , including a highly polished pair of alligator boots and the largest Stetson available from any shop . His belt buckle was massive and made of solid silver . An eagle dominated the buckle , and the initials J.S. flanked the metallic bird . Jedediah Smith was one of the richest industrialists in Utah . He was given his name because his mother claimed to be a direct descendant of the legendary mountain man , Jedediah Smith , who in 1826 explored what would become the state of Utah from north to south . No one had ever proved the genealogical link between the industrialist and the mountain man , but no one had ever disputed it either . Smith warmly shook MacLoon 's hand , then went immediately to a bar that had been set up by the senator 's aide and poured himself a stacked tumbler of bourbon . The other man ,  | Ted Proust , was considerably shorter and thinner than Smith . He wore an expensive gray three-piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger frame . Although not yet forty , he 'd lost much of his black hair and what was left was pasted along his temples and over a bald spot . He had a pinched face , a large aquiline nose and dark eyes that were in constant motion , like ball bearings . " Hello , Ted , " MacLoon said to Proust . " Put your bag down and have a drink . " The three men sat in a tight circle and exchanged pleasantries until Smith shifted in his chair , which allowed his jacket to fall open and reveal a .45 caliber semiautomatic revolver on his hip . " How did the speech go ? " he asked MacLoon . " You 're not interested in that , Jed . You told me on the phone when you encouraged me to come out here that you were getting nervous about where the missile system debate was going . I told you not to worry , but you never did listen to me . " Smith laughed , exposing a remarkably even and white set of teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Will ? " All laughed . The point is , Will , myself and some of the other people have been reading troublesome reports about the missile system . I 'm not talking about where in hell it 's put , I 'm talking about whether the damn thing will ever get built in the first place . " " It will if I have something to say about it , " MacLoon said . He wished he had n't . It was a weak comment , which he chalked up to having had too much to drink . He told himself to forgo what was in his glass , which he placed on the carpeted floor . Smith 's face reflected his displeasure at what MacLoon had said . He looked at Ted Proust , then back at the senator . " It 's our feeling that we 've got too much invested in this thing now to sit back and let it take its own sweet way . The way we figure it , Will , is that it needs a final push to get it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of  | Utah . What the hell . . . its biggest opposition died when the late , beloved Senator Caldwell checked out . ' MacLoon was growing increasingly uncomfortable with the conversation . He wished he 'd stayed in Washington to work on the missile project without interference by Smith . But he also knew that it was an unreasonable wish . Smith had spearheaded an anonymous , private committee of leading citizens to insure that the missile system would be placed in Utah . The group had attacked the problem on many levels and from many directions . A sophisticated propaganda campaign had been launched directed at lawmakers who held the decision in their hands . Committees were formed in Utah to sell its citizens on the virtues of having the system located there . There were a significant number of Utah residents who were firmly opposed to it on many grounds , including ecological , but their efforts had paled in the face of the massive amount of money pumped into the other side 's campaign . " What 's the problem , Jed ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem , Will , is that things do n't seem to be working as they should . To repeat myself , we all assumed , as you 'll recall , that once Caldwell was out of the way the opposition to the system itself , and to having it put in Utah , would fade away . In fact , you told us that right after Caldwell was .. . well , anyway , it does n't look as though it 's really moving in that direction . At least not quickly enough . " MacLoon ignored his previous private pledge , picked up his glass and took a hefty swig of the whiskey . " Well , " he said , " the opposition did seem to splinter once Caldwell was dead . That was a reasonable assumption , and it happened like we expected . The problem is that out of the woodwork have come a couple of others who 've picked up where Caldwell left off . I 'm not particularly worried about them . I think when the chips are down they 'll come around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to their home states , and I pull strings where those bills are concerned . " " He drank again , shook his head . " No , Jed , I still say that things are going pretty much the way we wanted them to . "  | Smith took a long , thin black cigar from his pocket and lit it with deliberate flourish , then asked MacLoon , " Want one , Will ? " " No , thanks . " " Your problem , " Smith said , tilting back his head and enjoying the feel of smoke slowly being exhaled through his nostrils . " Cuban . " He took another satisfying drag on the cigar , flicked an ash into an ashtray , leaned forward and said to MacLoon , " I think you said before , Will , that things were going pretty much the way we want them . That 's not good enough . There 's no sense in building seven-eighths of a house and then not moving in because you do n't want to pay to put doors on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than seven million dollars to make sure the system comes home to roost , and I 'm not about to lose it for the sake of another million or so . " MacLoon looked at Proust and extended his hands in a helpless gesture . " What good would a couple of million more do ? " he asked . Proust looked away from him , forcing MacLoon to return his attention to Smith . " We 've distributed the money to those people who count , at least those we knew would take it and be appreciative . Giving them more wo n't help . They 're already in line . " Smith fiddled with the turquoise clasp on his string tie , pursed his lips . " What about these newcomers you men-tioned ? " MacLoon shook his head . " It would be a mistake to even approach them . " " Why ? " " I just do n't think they 'd be receptive . After all , I 've been in the Senate for a long time , Jed . I can size up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they ? " Smith asked . " Markowski , for one . Jennings is another , so is Hannigan . " " What about other considerations ? " Smith asked . " Who 's got what on them ? " MacLoon laughed nervously . " I do n't really know . " " They 're not virgins , are they ? " Smith said . Ted Proust laughed appreciatively.  | MacLoon hesitated . " I can do some checking with the MPD , but I would n't count on it turning up very much . This new breed we 've been getting in Congress is pretty straight-arrow . They 'll trade for things they believe in , but  --  " " Bull , " Smith said . " Like they say , every man has his price . Even a distinguished senior senator from the great state of Utah . " MacLoon stiffened against the back of his chair . He tried to ignore the comment and assured Smith that he would do whatever he could to push things along . Smith said to MacLoon , " Ted brought some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to go back to Washington and come up with some more people who like candy , Will . Look outside Congress , as we 've done before . This decision involves every agency in government , and most people have a sweet tooth . I do . So do you . " MacLoon wanted them to leave , wanted the evening to be over . " Do n't worry , Jed , I 'll go back and make a final push that will make sure this thing is wrapped up . You can count on me , and you can tell the others that . " Smith stubbed out the cigar , stood and placed a hand on each of MacLoon 's arms . " Will , it 's a pleasure and a privilege having you represent the state of Utah in the United States Senate . Believe me , when this matter is satisfactorily resolved , the people of Utah will be behind you as they never have been before . " " I appreciate that , Jed . Shall I call you tomorrow ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll fly to Washington and distribute the candy to the kids you think deserve it . By the way , Will , we arranged for an old friend of yours to be here tonight . " " Who 's that ? " " Come see , " Smith said . The three men left the suite and went down the hall to a room two doors away . Smith knocked . The door was opened by a tall , statuesque girl in a transparent negligee . " Hello , senator . "  | " I 'll be damned , ' MacLoon said , stepping through the door . " Kitty .. " I would n't be surprised , senator , " Smith said as he and Proust walked up the hall .  | LYDIA HAD wanted to contact Senator Caldwell 's physician ever since Horace Jenkins told her that Caldwell had cancer at the time of his murder . Obviously the doctor , whose name was George Clemow , would be bound by the restrictions of the doctor-patient relationship . Still , the notion stuck in Lydia 's mind and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call . Clemow 's receptionist told Lydia that the doctor was with a patient but would get back to her . Thirty minutes later he did . Lydia had met George Clemow some years before . He 'd been Cale Caldwell 's personal physician for years and had been present at social gatherings in the Caldwell home . Clemow was a New Zealander who despite many years in the United States had not lost his native accent . " I 'm hoping you remember me , Dr. Clemow , " she said . " Oh , yes , I certainly do . And if I did n't , Miss James , I certainly know you now . You 've gotten quite a bit of attention from the media . . . How are you ? " " Just fine . . . I appreciate your returning my call , doctor . Naturally , I 'm calling about Senator Caldwell . " A moment of silence . Then : " A terrible thing . Bad enough that the man was murdered , but to have his own son guilty ... well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Clemow , I realize you ca n't talk in detail about Senator Caldwell 's health , that certain matters are confidential , like they are between a lawyer and client , but I was told by what I consider a very reliable source that Senator Caldwell 's autopsy revealed cancer ? " " Miss James , as you said , I 'm still not able to discuss that ? " " Yes , I understand , doctor , but perhaps you could tell me something that would n't compromise your situation . Any-  | thing . . . " She realized she sounded almost desperate , but what was there to lose ? She was fishing , of course , but in the face of the situation , with Mark Adam , now indicted and facing trial and the committee preparing a report . . . well , anything went . Besides , how do you catch a fish if you never go fishing ? .. . " It sounds as though you 're not particularly pleased with matters ? " " Doctor , I 'll be indiscreet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's confession . You said it was mindboggling yourself . So if there 's anything at all that might help to " Well . . . there is one thing that I might mention , and I do n't think it violates the confidentiality of my relationship with the senator ? " " What 's that , doctor ? " " Senator Caldwell was . . . distraught over the results of some tests . He told me he thought he should tie up some loose ends in his life . He did n't tell me what they were . . . and I 'm not telling you what the tests showed . . . " Lydia allowed herself to feel a tingle of excitement .. were the fish finally biting ? . . . " Of course not , doctor . Anything else ? " " Well , the senator told me that he was writing a letter in which he would set some things straight , and that the letter was to be opened on his death . " Lydia , holding her breath , said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told me that he intended to give the letter to me to hold until he died . He never did . " " Maybe he never finished it , doctor ? He died sooner than he 'd anticipated ? " " No , Miss James , he did finish the letter . At least he told me he had . . . he was angry at himself for forgetting to bring it to me and said he would on the next visit . I 'm afraid there never was a next visit . " " Who has the letter , do you suppose ? " " I do n't know . . . his family , I think . . . In any case , it  | distresses me that his wishes were n't carried out . I 'd suggested that he leave the letter with his attorney or with Veronica , but he said neither was possible . Strange ... " Lydia forced herself to make a few moments of small talk about the senator , then thanked the doctor for his time and hung up . Ginger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her face , breathing heavily , as though she 'd been running . " I 'm really not late , Lydia , " she said , taking off her coat and tossing it on a chair . " I was here at seven . " " Why ? " " I could n't sleep . What a night . Harold and I sat up all night and talked about us . He 's so crazy , Lydia , but so nice . He wants to marry me ? " " That 's wonderful ? " " No , it really is n't . He told me he wants an old-fashioned woman who 'll be a mother to his children and run a nice , neat house from which he can go forth to build his career and so forth . Imagine me housebound , wearing an apron , doing dishes , washing diapers . " Lydia smiled . " Nobody washes diapers any more , Ginger . They 're disposable .

" She directed a stream of air from her lips up to the hair on her forehead . " What 's a girl to do ? I 'm exhausted from being up all night , which is how come I came in here early . . . Did you get the message ? " " What message ? " " A call from Christa Jones . Right after I arrived this morning . There , it 's on your desk . " She pointed to a mass of paper that virtually covered the desk 's surface .  | Lydia shu 1 ; ed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name had been scrawled . " What did she want ? " " She would n't say . She sounded off-the-wall , though . Panicky . When I told her you were n't here , she said she would call you again when she could . " " I 'll try her now , " Lydia said , picking up the phone and dialing the number for WCAP . She asked the operator to be connected with Christa Jones 's office . " I 'm sorry , but Miss Jones is no longer with the station . " " Oh . . . where can I reach her ? " " I have no idea . Sorry , ma'am . " " Did you know Christa Jones is n't working for Quentin Hughes any more ? " Lydia asked Ginger after she 'd hung up . " No . " " Do you have a home phone number for her ? " " It 's unlisted . " " I hope she calls back . There was something about her that stayed with me . " " What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I had the feeling she wanted to tell me something but could n't bring herself to do it . " As Ginger left the office Lydia called Cale Caldwell , Jr. , and was put through to him by Joanne Marshall . " I 'm glad you called , Lydia . Frankly , after all the things I told you the other day , I worried about how you might have taken it . I hope you know it was n't so easy to tell you those things about Mark and Jimmye . But mother and I respect you . We trust you . End of speech . " " Cale , I appreciate it . . . But here I am , the investigator again . . . sorry . . . Cale , do you know anything about a letter your father wrote that was to be opened on his death ? " " A letter ? No . . .

Believe me , I 've an idea of what you all have been going through . I 've said it before , but I 'll say it again . You come from a ... a remarkable family . " It was a warm , appreciative laugh . " Yes , I do , Lydia . I damn well do . No matter what 's happened , I 'll always be grateful for that . . . . " Her next call was to Quentin Hughes 's apartment in the Watergate . The line was busy . She tried again five minutes later and again the annoying busy signal buzz . She 'd wanted to ask Hughes how she might reach his former producer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy signal , she gave up . Probably Christa had left because of her problems with Hughes , and it was unlikely he 'd give a damn whether anybody contacted her or not . She 'd just have to wait for her to call again . Quentin Hughes listened as his mother told him on the phone about what had happened to her in Des Moines . Two men had forced their way into her house , ransacked it and terrified her . She was still shaken , and a family physician had come to the house and sedated her . The police had been called , but when it became evident that nothing had been taken from the house , they seemed to have lost interest in going after the two young men who 'd forced their way inside . ... and you have no idea what they were looking for , momma ?

I told you what they were , a couple of nuts . Rest and take care of yourself . Have the locks changed on the door . I 'll pay for it . " " I do n't like being here alone . " " We 'll talk about it soon . Goodbye , momma . " He hung up and quickly went to the kitchen , took the key from the nail behind the refrigerator and went to his bedroom . He pulled the fireproof chest out into the middle of the room and nervously opened it . The brown package was missing . He went to the living room , took a violent swipe at a lamp on the desk , sending it flying across the room . He clenched his fists .

John Conegli pulled up in front of Christa Jones 's apartment building just as she was turning the corner in search of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parking spot . He walked to the front of her building , looked up and down the street , entered the foyer . He removed a set of master keys from his pocket and tried several before one worked . He opened the locked door separating the foyer from the interior of the building , closed it behind him , listened for sounds . The mailbox said that Christa 's apartment was number 4 . He looked for an elevator . There was n't any . He cursed silently as he began the long trek up four flights of stairs . By the time he reached the top he was breathing heavily , and his right leg that had been treated for phlebitis two years before had started to ache . He stood in front of Christa 's apartment door and again listened for sounds . This time the first key on the ring opened the door . One of Christa 's cats looked at him from where it had been asleep on a windowsill , yawned , then put its head back on its paws . The other cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gently brought his shoe up under its belly and pushed it away . " Get lost , cat . " He 'd never liked cats . Sneaky creatures . He looked in the bathroom , the kitchen . A large bag of dry cat food had been emptied onto a succession of paper plates . Next to the plates were two animal feeding bowls that were filled to the brim with water . An eight-quart pot had also been filled with water and sat on the floor . " Looks like she took off for a while , " he mumbled to himself . " Looks like she 's planning to come back , too . "  | He systematically searched every corner of the apartment . He could have worked faster , but he did n't want to leave evidence that someone had been there , which meant carefully replacing each thing he moved . Two hours later , his search completed , he sat on the couch , put his feet up on a coffee table and closed his eyes . Five minutes later he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of Clarence Foster-Sims 's apartment . He 'd listened in on a conversation the other night between FosterSims and Lydia James . Because it had taken place on the phone , he 'd only heard Foster-Sims 's side of the conversation , but it was enough to learn that they were having dinner that night at Foster-Sims 's apartment . He stopped at a tobacco shop and stocked up on cigars . Chances were , it would be a long night . The phone started ringing as Lydia fumbled in her purse for the key to her brownstone . She hurried opening the door , ran into the living room and grabbed up the phone . " Hello . " A pause . " Miss James ? " " Yes . Who is this ? " Silence . Then , " This is Christa Jones , Quentin Hughes 's producer . . . " " Oh , yes ? " Lydia cradled the phone to her ear with her shoulder as she quickly sorted through the mail . Along with bills and junk mail was a brown envelope just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed to her by hand , and the upper lefthand corner read : " C. Jones . " " It 's nice to hear from you , " Lydia said . " I was just looking at my mail and see that I have something from you ? " " Miss James , I ? " She started to cry . " Miss Jones , are you all right ? " " Yes . . . no , I 'm not all right . I hate to bother you , and I know this is n't your problem , but I have to talk to someone ... " " I 'm happy to talk to you . What 's wrong ? Has it anything to do with the envelope I just received from you ? "  | " Yes , that and more . Could we meet tonight ? " Lydia was due at Clarence 's apartment in an hour . She 'd been very much looking forward to it . Still , how to ignore the lh urgency in Christa 's voice ... she 'd call Clarence , tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asked Christa whether what she had to say had anything to do with the Caldwell case . A hesitation , no immediate response . Only background noise Ij that indicated a public booth . When Christa still did n't answer , Lydia repeated the question . " Yes . . . in a way it does . " " Where are you ? " " In the bus station , downtown . " I , 1I " All right , it will have to be quick , though . Can I meet you now ? " 11 ' " Yes , please . I 'm leaving very shortly . " Lydia placed a quick call to Clarence , calmed him as best 11 she could , slipped into her shoes , ran a brush through her hair and headed into the center of Washington . ill The bus depot was teeming , complete with the usual assortment of derelicts and prostitutes mingling with a wide variety of citizens about to catch buses . She walked through the terminal , trying to spot Christa Jones . After one complete tour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Should she try again , she wondered ? Which was when she did spot Christa coming out of a rest room , carrying a piece of molded Samsonite luggage . She was wearing a long , quilted , apricot down coat . Her hair was in disarray , her face reflected II ' the upset that had been in her voice over the phone . " I was about to give up , " Lydia said as Christa came up to her . " I 'm sorry . I was in there . " She half turned and pointed toward the rest room . I " Well , here we are . Where can we talk ? " They surveyed the main passenger area . Most seats were taken , and those that were n't were singles or next to other people . " How was the ladies ' room ? " Lydia asked . " Almost empty . " ' ' '  | " Let 's go , " Lydia said . Two women were in the rest room but soon left . Lydia and Christa were alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been inside the larger envelope Christa had sent her . The flap had been sealed and covered with Scotch tape . Written on the front was " To be opened 3 days from receipt . " " What 's this ? " Lydia asked . " Something I want you to have in case anything happens to me . Lydia frowned and ran her fingertips over the envelope . There appeared to be papers in it , and a hard object .. . maybe a key ? " Christa , why do you think something might happen to you ? " " I ca n't go into it now . " She looked at her watch . " I have to catch my bus soon . Please do n't open it for three days . I need time . I hope I 'll be back by then . If I am , we 'll open it together . If not . . . well , open it , and the rest is up to you . .. " " Why me , Christa ? " " Because I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and Lydia and Christa put their conversation on hold . Other women arrived , and Lydia suggested they leave the room and continue the conversation outside . They stood next to a row of vending machines . When Lydia was certain no one was within earshot she asked again , " Why do you think something might happen to you ? Who would want to hurt you ? " Christa , who 'd appeared to have calmed down in the rest room , was now visibly anxious . She fiddled with the buttons on her coat , pushed a discarded cigarette butt around the floor with her foot and glanced nervously at everything except Lydia . " Christa , " Lydia said , placing her hand on her arm , " you 've chosen to include me in whatever is happening to you . It is n't fair , it does n't make sense to drop hints and then cut me off . " " I know , I know . I did n't mean to include you . . . Let me have the envelope back . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm not thinking too clearly ? "  | " Christa , I 'm not suggesting that I do n't want to be involved . What I 'm saying is that if I am I 'd like you to be honest with me . I asked you when you called whether this had to do with the Caldwell murder . You said it did . What ? " Christa slumped against the side of one of the machines . " Oh , my God , why did this have to happen ? " " Why did what happen ? " " The whole thing . . . Jimmye McNab , Quentin . . . it was all so unnecessary . I told him that he was making a terrible mistake , that she was no good for him ? " " Quentin Hughes and Jimmye McNab ? " " Yes . " Her face hardened now . " Yes , them . He said he loved her more than any other woman . . . he did that to me , talked about other women . . . God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you loved him , did n't you ? " She closed her eyes . " Yes , and the disgusting thing is , I still do . " She opened her eyes . There was fear in them . " She was the worst , Miss James . " " Who ? " " Jimmye McNab . She was so cruel , but he could n't see it , or did n't care . Or maybe he liked it ... She used people like nobody I 've ever met , and I 've met some in my day , believe me . Ironic , Quentin is a user too . Maybe it 's like what they say about salesmen . . . They 're the easiest to sell . Anyway , I knew what she was up to , what she was doing to him . " Lydia knew she was running out of time , Christa had said she was catching a bus . How much stock to put in what she 'd been told . . . Christa Jones was obviously a very disturbed woman . No time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quentin Hughes kill Senator Caldwell ? Or Jimmye ? ? " It was as though her question had covered Christa in a sheet of ice . She seemed to freeze , her mouth set . " Is that what you want to tell me ? " Lydia pressed . " Are you telling me that Quentin Hughes killed out of jealousy ? ? " " No . " " Then what ? " " She deserved to die , Miss James . I hated her with every cell in my body ? "  | ' You ? " Christa seemed confused . " Did you . . . kill Jimmye McNab ? " " I would have loved to . " Before Lydia could ask any more questions , Christa said she had to go to her bus . " I 'll come with you , " Lydia said . She really wanted to escape the bus terminal , escape to the quiet and comfort of Foster-Sims 's apartment . But she was also afraid to lose Christa , to lose the lead she represented . . . disturbed or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed increasingly genuine as she talked . " No , I want to go alone . I 'll be back in three days . If I 'm not , open the envelope . Please , Miss James , not before then . I need these three days to think , to figure out whether I 'm doing the right thing . I have a good friend I can stay with . " She squeezed Lydia 's hand and was suddenly swallowed by a crowd . Lydia pushed through that same crowd and watched the back of the apricot coat go up to a waiting bus that said New York . Christa never looked back , simply handed her ticket to the driver standing at the open door and disappeared inside . In her car Lydia tried to sort out her jumbled thoughts . She was annoyed to have been enticed by Christa to the bus terminal on the promise of learning something of importance to the Caldwell case . That had n't , so far as she could tell , happened . Of course she was sorry for Christa Jones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the frustrations were getting to her . She started the engine , about to head for Clarence 's apartment , when she happened to look down at the seat next to her and saw Christa 's envelope . She touched it , felt the hard object inside , shut off the ignition , tore open the envelope and removed a locker key . There was a long letter she did n't read all of because what seemed to matter most were the words : " You 'll find a videotape in a locker at the bus station . The key is to that locker . It explains so much ... " Well , she 'd gone this far . . . She went back to the terminal ,  | found and opened the locker . Inside was a package wrapped in brown paper that she removed , tucked under her coat , then went to her car and drove too fast to Clarence 's apartment . " What do you make of it , " Clarence said as they sat at the dining room table , about to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , string beans and a tomato-and-onion salad with Italian dressing . Clarence , Lydia thought  --  and warmly  --  the complete man . " She seemed to want to tell me that she or Hughes killed Jimmye McNab . When she called me she said she had something to say about the Caldwell murder , but then she never mentioned Caldwell . . . Well , she 's obviously been crazy ? and I use the term advisedly  --  in love with Quentin Hughes for years , apparently since she first met him . I know it 's hard to understand , Clarence , especially for a man  --  but there are women , unfortunately , who fall in love with a man and stay with him no matter what happens , no matter how much abuse he heaps on them . That 's even part of the attraction , I 'm afraid . Think of the battered wives who keep coming back for more . And I could n't help but think of the Jean Harris case in New York . The doctor she killed was a Quentin Hughes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs under her nose . Still , she hung in with him . I hate to admit it but it seems a female failing at times , this need to love a man no matter what he is or what he does . " " Could be ... by the way , do you know where Christa was going ? " " Yes , to New York , to stay with some friends . " " And she claims the videotape has the answers to this mess ... or some of them ... Let 's see the letter again . . . All right , so she accuses Quentin Hughes of murdering Jimmye McNab and Senator Caldwell , with no evidence . " " She says the tape will explain things , although like you I 'm Ill not sure exactly what . " She hesitated , knowing what he was thinking and not wanting to face the next step . . . " Clarence , I felt I had to betray a confidence to the extent of opening the letter , but the tape . . . ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it tonight . And to see the tape you 'd need special equipment . Let 's leave it alone for now . " " It was , of course , what she wanted to hear . " You know , Lydia , I can accept the fact that she stayed with Hughes despite , or even because of , the s.o.b . he is . But it 's also logical to assume that Christa Jones killed Jimmye McNab out of jealousy " But what about Hughes ? " " Why , if he was so crazy about her ? " " Remember , Christa also said that Jimmye was as bad as Hughes , a user . . . she could have provoked him to murder ... except how does all this relate to Senator Caldwell 's murder ? " " Eat before it gets cold . We 'll solve this over coffee and dessert . " He smiled when he said it . But when they were finished he had a better idea . " You know , murder will out but it can also wait . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " Best offer I 've had all day . " John Conegli sat in his car outside Clarence 's apartment building and leaned close to the speaker that picked up some of the dialogue between Lydia and Clarence . He 'd heard Lydia say that Christa had gone to New York , and he 'd picked up the reference to the tape . From what he heard he assumed Christa had taken the tape with her , but of course he could n't be sure . He also heard that Lydia had opened some letter from Christa , and was n't feeling too good about it .. . The sound of the television set and the rustle of the bedclothes now took center stage . He sat back and bit his lip . He wanted to stay and keep listening , but knew he had a much more pressing obligation . He got out of the car and went to a phone booth on the corner , pulled out a little black book from his pocket and thumbed through it until finding the name he was looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a number . To his relief , it was answered by the person he wanted to reach .  | " Johnny , how the hell are you ? " the voice from New York said . " Not so good , Hal . Look , I do n't have much time . I 'm working on a big case down here and I need your help . " ? I 'm busy. ? " Just tonight , Hal . There 's a woman arriving on a bus from Washington any minute now . I do n't know exactly how long it takes buses to get up there but I figure it should be pulling in about now . Her name is Christa Jones . She 's kind of a wackylooking broad , tall , lots of gray streaks in black hair , does n't wear makeup , as I remember . The point is she 's getting off the bus and visiting a friend . All I want you to do is meet the bus , if it 's not too late , follow her and find out where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hey , Johnny , I got a date and ? " " This client of mine pays good , Hal . I 'll take care of you . Besides , you owe me a couple . " Hal yawned . " All right , all right , I 'll do it . I wish I had a better description . " " Just do your best and let me know . " Conegli went back to his car and took up his listening again . He heard sounds , which he matched to his fantasies . Eventually , no sound from the bedroom . The television set was turned off . Conegli looked at his pad , reviewed what he 'd written . Obviously the most important piece of information was the mention of an envelope that Lydia James had been given , and that she was to open if this Christa Jones did n't come back to Washington . Home and a few hours sleep , but first he needed to stop at a luncheonette in Maryland , where he met with a young man with long black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-and-blue cowboy shirt , dungarees and cowboy boots . " I got a job for you , Billy , " Conegli told him as they had coffee at the counter . " Can use some work . " " This one 's important . " " They all are , ai n't they ? Lay it on me. "  | BORIS SLEVOKIAN , noted violinist , had spent the afternoon at Foster-Sims 's rehearsing pieces he 'd perform on a tour of the Far East . It had taken considerable arm-twisting to convince Clarence to work with him , and Clarence was even more surprised than Boris that he 'd agreed to do it . It had been the first time he 'd touched a piano in so many years , the Steinway seemed a formidable enemy . He interrupted the rehearsal with Boris  --  less painful than he 'd thought  --  to phone Lydia and tell her he 'd gone back to the of debbil piano . She 'd like that . " Lydia ? " " Hi , " she said as she continued stripping off her clothes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " I 've been worried all day about you . " " Why ? " " Because of the letter Christa Jones gave you . You must realize that certain people might do just about anything to get it away from you ? " " Clarence , no one knows about the letter or the tape except you , me and Christa . I sealed the letter in a committee envelope and gave it to Ginger to put in the office safe , along with lots of other documents . I did n't tell her what it was , and she did n't ask . I 'm always giving her bundles of documents to secure ? " " You gave it to Ginger ? Do you think that was smart ? " " Smart , safe  --  pardon the pun  --  and sound . Ginger may talk like a flake but she 's far from it . I also put the videotape in the safe , me myself . I checked with the Senate television studio and they told me it can only handle three-quarter-inch tape , the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | from the locker is two inches . I guess the only place to see it is at a television studio that has two-inch equipment . " " I have a friend who has his own recorder at home ? " " No good . Those are too small too . Willy-nilly , it looks like I 'll come close to honoring Christa 's request . Which , matter of fact , I 'm kind of thankful for . " And now I 'm off for dinner with the fair Ginger . I like her a lot . She 's full of beans . . . " " Not my style , lady , but . . . Hey , guess what . . . I 've been playing the old piano all afternoon . " " That 's terrific . What brought it on ? " " The people 's choice . . . Boris Slevokian . I 've been working on a new piece he 's going to incorporate in his next tour . The fingers are pretty stiff , Lydia . " She smiled , allowing herself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence , darling , I 've got to go . . . I 'll call you if I do n't get home too late ... " " Please do , I 'll be up late . " John Conegli , who 'd arrived in front of Foster-Sims 's apartment an hour earlier , had heard Clarence 's side of the telephone conversation with Lydia , heard him echo Lydia saying that Ginger Johnson had been given the envelope , which meant that Conegli needed to change some plans he 'd made for the evening . He pulled quickly away from the curb and drove to Ginger 's address , checked the mailboxes to note that she lived in 14-F , then left the building and went to a phone booth . His call was answered on the first ring by a woman . " Let me speak to Billy . " " He ai n't here . " " Who 's this ? " " His mother . Who 's this ? " " A friend . Did he say where he was going ? " " He said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped outside the booth . He considered trying to head Billy off himself but was reluctant to leave . Given what Foster-Sims had said , the best shot he had at the envelope was Ginger Johnson . Besides , he reasoned , nothing  | would really be lost by having Billy go through with the job he 'd assigned him to . Sort of an insurance job . Lydia sat in a booth in Martin 's Tavern on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown . Martin 's had been a landmark since it opened in 1933 . To Lydia it somehow represented the quintessential Georgetown hangout  --  dark wooden booths , veteran waiters in green jackets , a long oak bar behind which an extensive collection of steins stood proudly on shelves . Martin 's attracted the athletic set , which was not surprising considering the fact that it had been opened by a former baseball player with the Boston Braves , Bill Martin . A small back room was known as the Dugout . Lydia was not worried by Ginger 's lateness . She was never on time . As she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory about people who were chronically late . It was a way to insure attention . . . people were either waiting for their entrance or helping them make an exit for an appointment . It did n't really matter , she decided , unless it was deliberate . She took another sip and waited for Ginger to come through the front door in her usual state of high energy , plus a little high anxiety . When another twenty minutes had passed , Lydia put aside philosophy and began to worry . She was sure this was the night they 'd planned to meet . . . she considered calling Ginger 's home , told herself she 's probably on her way right now ... Fifteen minutes later Lydia made the call to Ginger 's apartment . Harold answered . " This is Lydia James , Harold . I was supposed to meet Ginger for dinner but she has n't shown up yet . I was getting worried ? " " You were right . . . " He sounded out of breath and in a hurry . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again . " " What ? My God . . . is she all right ? " " I think so . They were taking her to the hospital when they  | called . I heard her yelling in the background that she did n't want to go to any hospital , I 'm glad they insisted . . Lydia told the waiter that her plans had been changed , paid for the kir and left Martin 's . She was annoyed at herself that she 'd been so upset she had n't asked what hospital Ginger had been taken to . She 'd go home , wait for a call . She pulled her Buick into a tiny alley to the rear of her brownstone , got out and walked quickly around the side of the building and toward the front door . In the darkness she stumbled over a loose red brick in the narrow sidewalk . She 'd noticed it before and had meant to fix it . She continued along the path " Do n't move . " A man stepped out from behind bushes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forearm around her neck and pushed the point of a knife into her back . Lydia felt paralyzed . " Walk nice and easy to the front door . " She did . When they got to the front door she said , " I do n't have any money in the house , it 's in my purse , take it and please leave me alone ? " " Shut up and open the door . " Her only thought was that she was about to be raped . If he did n't want money , what else ? As she fumbled for her keys , she actually tried to remember what she 'd read or seen on television about how to handle a rapist . It had all seemed so clear and sensible before . Now , faced with the reality , it was anything but . . . was it better to put up a struggle , or go along and try to talk him out of it ? She opened the door and they stumbled inside , his arm still around her neck . He kicked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face hit the wall and she felt a dull ache in her cheekbone . " Do n't turn around , lady . " She did n't , but caught her first sight of him in a mirror ? young , long black hair . She was surprised to have enough composure to take stock of him . She also noticed he wore a buff , fringed suede jacket over a dark shirt .  | He looked around the entrance hallway . She saw the knife for the first time . It looked like what she thought of as a hunting knife , and large . " Come on , let 's go in , " he said motioning his head toward the living room . Lydia turned to face him . " Who are you ? " Not , she told herself , a particularly sensible question under the circumstances . Come on , Lydia .. . He smiled . " Do n't be silly , lady . Now take it easy , I ai n't going to hurt you unless I have to . " He was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a fight , he 'd have to use his knife to He grabbed her arm and whirled her into the living room . " You can save me a lot of time , lady . Just give me the envelope that 's so important . " ( Conegli , a real sweetheart , had n't bothered to call off his dogs . ) His demand shocked her . Why would he want Christa Jones 's envelope ? How did he even know about it ? Did he know its contents , or , more likely , was he acting on someone else 's orders ? " I do n't know what you 're talking about ? " " Lady , I do n't mind tying you up and tearing this place apart if I have to . Be a smart lady and give me the envelope and save us both time and trouble . " She decided to tell the truth , which as any lawyer could tell you , was often the least convincing in a court of law . Well , this was no court of law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ... She said , " I do n't have the envelope you 're looking for . I gave it to someone on my staff , it 's in my office ... " Of course , he did n't believe her ... " It could be so easy , lady , but you do n't seem to care . " He stepped closer . The knife in his right hand was pointed at her stomach . He grabbed her right shoulder and spun her around . She stumbled across the room , fell onto the couch . He was on her , twisting her left arm behind her back and forcing it up with increasing pressure toward her shoulders . She called out in pain , furious to give him that much satisfaction . " Shut up and tell me where that envelope is or I 'll break your arm off ? "  | I do n't have it . . . let go of me and I 'll tell you how we can get it . " He slowly released her wrist , stood , propped one scuffed cowboy boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled herself up , turned and sat on the arm of the couch . " Okay , lady . I 'm all ears . " She closed her eyes against the pain in her arm , tried to collect her thoughts . " I told you the letter is in my office . We can go there now and get it , I promise you I 'll give it to you there ? " " How far is your office ? " " Senate Building ? " " You a Senator . A woman ? " " I work there , for a committee . " More truth , which she gambled he 'd never believe . He seemed to think for a moment , and as he did she felt a rising , pulsating anger . No question now , if she 'd had a gun she 'd have used it on him , would have taken pleasure in doing it . She 'd stood in court many times and defended people like the man threatening her right now . She 'd pleaded for their rights , pointed to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to combat the prosecution and , often as not , was successful . She 'd believed in what she was doing , genuinely felt for most of her clients . Not now . What attorney . . . possibly herself ? . . . had set this man free so he could put a knife to her .. . He 'd made up his mind . " Get up . " " What are you going to do ? " He slapped her . She was surprised how little it hurt . " Where 's your bedroom ? " She stood and slowly led him from the living room to the bedroom . He flicked on an overhead light . " Nice , " he said . " Nice big bed . " She said nothing , just stood there and waited for his next move . He was directly behind her , she felt the knife was poised for action . " Let 's see , where would a classy lady like you hide an important letter ? Hard to say . Have you got a safe here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I 'm sure , just as I 'm sure the letter you want is " ? and then she glanced at the night table next to her bed on which a lamp , a clock and small box of Kleenex sat . The table had one drawer . She drew a deep breath . " All right , I do have the letter here . If I give it to you will you promise to leave me alone ? " " Now that you got smart and stopped lying , I 'll take it into consideration . " " I 'll get it for you . " She went to the night table . She could n't see him but knew he was following closely behind . In the drawer were envelopes containing legal documents from her law practice , to be reviewed at home before returning to the office . She paused , then bent over and slowly opened the drawer . Her left hand reached inside and found a long , white envelope stuffed with legal carbons . She quickly turned and thrust the envelope at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your envelope . " In the moment it took him to receive the envelope her left hand fell back into the drawer , her fingers clutched a four-inch black cylinder of CS tear gas  --  more commonly known in its packaged state as Mace . She 'd been given it a year ago by an attorney friend , who 'd told her she needed it , given the city she lived in and the people she represented . He 'd actually wanted her to apply for a gun permit , but she 'd always been against keeping firearms in a house . More to appease him than anything else , she 'd accepted the Mace , had put it in the night table drawer and pretty well forgotten about it . She had no real idea what effect it had on a person . Her thumb went to a white trigger on top of the cylinder . Her friend had showed her that all that was necessary to activate the cylinder was to swing the white trigger a quarter-turn , which took it from a lock position . She did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked if she was sure this was the letter , she brought her left hand up so that it was less than a foot from his face and squeezed down with all her might on the trigger . The **30;1254;TOOLONG  | gushed from the cylinder with a hiss . It covered his face . His mouth opened ; Lydia directed the stream of gas into it . He fell to the floor , writhing . The knife dropped to his side , and the envelope and its contents went out of his hands . Lydia could n't stop herself , leaned over and went on pressing the trigger until the twenty-two grams of Mace had been fully discharged , directly into his eyes and mouth . Now , a kind of revulsion set in . She was appalled at what she saw . He clawed at his eyes , and a long , agonizing cry came from him . She ran to the kitchen , grabbed the receiver from a wall phone and dialed the MPD . An officer answered on the first ring . " This is Lydia James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruder was in the house . He asked why she was able to get to a phone . " It does n't matter , send someone immediately . " She dropped the phone , leaving it dangling on its cord , and ran out of the house and across the street , where she leaned against a lamppost , put her cheek against its cool metal and waited for the police to arrive . . . . The first officer out of the car was Horace Jenkins , deputy chief of police . He saw Lydia and ran across the street to her . " What happened ? " She tried to speak and could n't . And then she buried her face in her hands and , like any other human being , broke down into deep , heaving sobs . Ten minutes later a police ambulance arrived and Lydia 's attacker was taken away . She was taken back to the house and now was in a small study , where she sat on a window bench and stared out the window . Jenkins came in . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a punk named Billy Baulkis . He 's got a long sheet on him . What did he try . . . rape ? " Lydia shook her head . " Money ? " " No , " she said so softly that it was barely audible . It does n't matter , does it . " " We 'll go into that later . Probably not . . . no harm , no foul ,  | is the way these damn things work out . . . By the way , where did you get the Mace ? " " It was a gift . If you want to arrest me for possession , feel free . " Jenkins patted the pocket of his raincoat . " No , I 'll toss it when I get back to headquarters . Good thing you had it , but do n't quote me . Will you be all right now ? " " Yes , I will , thank you . " " Maybe you should n't stay alone here tonight . " She assured him she would leave immediately to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Horace , for coming . I 'll be all right . " " Glad I came on the call myself , " he said . " Well , good night , Lydia . Do n't let it get to you . Punks like him are all over this city these days . " After he was gone Lydia called Clarence . She quickly told him what had happened and said flat-out she wanted to spend the night . He told her not to drive . Ten minutes later he was at her front door and had a cab waiting at the curb . Much later that night Clarence provided the medicine she most needed . Only then did she manage to sleep ... . When she awoke in the early morning it occurred to her that her attack had coincided with the one on Ginger . She called Ginger 's apartment . " How are you ? " Lydia asked . " Disgusted . I 'm sorry I stood you up last night , but it was due to circumstances beyond my control . " " Well , kiddo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How so ? " " I 'll tell you when I see you . How are you feeling ? " " Not so bad , actually . At least I got a look at the guy and his car . I ended up with a bump on the head again and one more lost purse , but , like they say , it could be worse . I 'll be in this afternoon . " " So will I , " Lydia said . " I think we have some debriefing to do . "  | SENATOR WILFRED MacLoon was nearing the end of his press briefing . He 'd set a routine of weekly meetings with selected members of the press a number of years before , and had found it to be a useful way to help keep his name in front of the public and help deflect press and other criticism before it could develop to a serious degree . He 'd covered a variety of weighty-sounding subjects in the briefing , including whether or not the new missile system would get through the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and added , for rather obvious home consumption , that every strategic study made it increasingly clear that Utah provided the best possible site for its deployment . His final item had to do with a proposed Senate investigation into the practices of religious cults . He 'd been instrumental , indeed , pivotal , in having such investigations shelved for at least a year . That vote had taken place the day before , and one of the reporters asked MacLoon to explain why he 'd taken such a stand in favor of religious cults . " That 's the trouble with you people , " MacLoon said . His cigar had gone out . He lit it again . " I did it because I 'm against the Congress of the United States poking its nose into organized religion , and because I respect the Constitution upon which this nation was built . It does n't mean I 'm in favor of cults . In fact , I 'm not , and many of the things I hear about them disturb me . But the bottom , line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy is the separation of church and state . For the government to investigate religion would be to disregard what our founding fathers , in their wisdom , bequeathed us . No , I am not in favor of cults , ladies and gentlemen , but I am in favor of church and state going their own separate ways . "
