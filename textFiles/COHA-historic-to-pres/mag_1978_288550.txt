In the glory days of Empire , English art buyers plundered the riches of Italy , France and Greece . But since World War II , the down-at-heel British lion has been unable to compete with Americans , Japanese , and assorted European collectors in the all too open international art market . As a result they have begun to concentrate on simply hanging onto whatever treasures they already have . They rallied round to raise $4 million , thus saving a Titian . But another masterpiece - Velsquez 's portrait of his assistant Juan de Pareja , for example , was snatched from them in 1970 by a $5.5 million offer from New York 's Metropolitan Museum . This Christmas , though , Britons had an art-treasure story with a happy ending that was almost Dickensian . <P> The unlikely painter in question was George Stubbs . The son of a Liverpool tanner , Stubbs began drawing human bones when he was only eight years old . Later in life he sequestered himself on a Lincolnshire farm with his " niece , " lugged the carcasses of horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could study their anatomy . Local folk complained that Stubbs made the country round smell like a battlefield . But in 1766 , when Stubbs finally published his scrupulous horse drawings , they were recognized as masterly . His paintings , however , were admired mainly by horse lovers , many of them titled . Only in the past two decades have modern critics begun to value him highly , because he had a fine eye for English landscape and deceptively simple pastoral scenes of farmers at work . <P> Six months ago , it suddenly appeared that two of his very best works , The Haymakers and The Reapers painted in 1785 , were about to be bought away from England . Their owner , Major John Lycett Wills , found that he had to sell off the pair . As recently as 1933 they had brought only 10 apiece ; this year their worth was estimated at $1.8 million . Generously the owner offered them to London 's Tate Gallery for a bargain price of $1.4 million , giving Director Sir Norman Reid till Christmas to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STUBBS posters , the Tate managed to collect $900,000 . By November they were still short , when aid came from an unexpected source . Philanthropist Paul Mellon , who recently gave much of his priceless collection of 18th and 19th century British paintings to Yale , had been considered the most likely foreign buyer if the Tate fell short . But Mellon , a self-styled " galloping Anglophile , " felt the paintings should stay in England . He contributed four paintings from his private collection , two Vuillards , a Bonnard and a Giacometti , to a benefit auction . They went for about $90,000 , and soon , with more than a little help from the British government , the two Stubbs found themselves safely ensconced in the Tate . British art lovers could breathe easy-for a while at least .
