MR . HOOVER QUALIFIES . Constitutional Provision Is for Fourteen Years ' Residence In All . To the Editor of The New York Times : The assertion has been made in at least two ne*spapers that Mr. Hoover is not an available candidate for the Presidency because he does not satisfy the requirements which , are contained in Article II. , Section 1 , of the Constitution of the United States , which are as follows : " No person except a natural-born citizen , or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the office of President ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of 35 y.ears , and been fourteen years a resident within the United States . " The particular requirement which it is asserted that Mr. Hoover does not satisfy is the one which has been italicized . Light is thrown upon the purpose and meaning of the qualification of a President in respect of residence by an examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volume 5 of Elliot 's Debates , Pages 363 , 447 , 462 , 503 , 507 , 521 , 530 and 562 . The same material is contained in Farrand 's Records of the Federal Convention . On July 24 , 1787 , a committee of five was elected " to report a Constitution conformable to the resolutions passed by the convention . " On Aug. 20 it was moved " that the committee be instructed to report proper qualifications for the President . " On Aug. 22 the committee reported a proposal that the qualifications be that " he shall be of the age of 35 years and a citizen of the United States , and shall have been an inhabitant thereof for twenty-one years . " This provision was not debated , and on Aug .. 31 this and other proposals which had not been acted upon were referred to a committee of eleven , one member from each State . On Sept. 4 this committee submitted the following provisions : " No person except a natural-born citizen , or a citizen of the United States at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligible to the office of President ; nor shall any person be elected to that office who shall be under the age of 35 years , and who has not been , in the whole , at least fourteen years a resident within the United States . " On Sept. 7 these provisions were agreed to without debate or dissent . On Sept. 8 " a committee was * * * appointed by ballot to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to ? * * . " This committee reported the Constitution substantially as it was finally adopted . A residence qualification for eligibility to the office of President was first suggested when the only other qualifications proposed were as to age and citizenship . It was reasonable to provide against the possibility of a person 's being elected to the high office of President who had but recently become a citizen and a resident and who would therefore not be familiar with our institutions and traditions . The committee of eleven radically modified the original proposal of the committee of five by requiring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be a " native-born citizen , or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution . " If these provisions had stood alone , it would still have been possible for a person who had become a citizen of one of the States just prior to the adoption of the Constitution to have been elected at any time thereafter to the Presidency . It would also have been possible for one who was a native-born citizen , but who had lived practically all his life outside of the United States , to become a candidate for the Presidency . To meet these possibilities It was further proposed by the committee of eleven that a. person shall not be elected " who has not been , in the whole , at least fourteen years a resident within the United States . " This was agreed to by the convention without alteration , discussion , or dissent . The committee which put the Constitution into final form was not authorized to make any changes in the substance of the provisions which had been adopted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the articles which have been agreed to . " The conclusion would seem , therefore , to be obvious . There is nothing in the wording of the Constitution which requires that a President shall have been a resident within the United States for the fourteen years next preceding his election . The Constitution simply requires that he shall have been " fourteen years a resident within the United States . " Clearly any fourteen years of his life will satisfy the requirement . This conclusion is made doubly clear when we find that the committee on style used the words which we now find in the Constitution as synonymous with the provision proposed by the committee of eleven , and adopted by the convention , that the President must have been " in the whole , at least fourteen years a resident within the United States .
