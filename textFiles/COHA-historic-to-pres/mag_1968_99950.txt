It was 32 minutes and 11 seconds past 3 o'clock in the afternoon , give or take a few fractions of a second . A big brown gelding named Devon Loch , running easily , took the lead at the third from the last fence at Aintree , pulled away steadily from a hard-toiling horse in second place and led on the flat toward the finish line by six lengths or more . No one was remotely threatening . The third horse was 16 lengths back , and the next was 26 lengths behind Devon Loch . // A little more than a hundred feet from the finish line Devon Loch made a sort of lunge into the air , came down on his belly and slid seven feet on the grass . His hind legs were stretched out flat behind him . His front legs extended in a widening V as he slid forward . But what seemed strangest was that he appeared undistressed . His head was up , his ears pricked with an expression  --  however unrealistic it seems to say it  --  of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran named Dick Francis , pitched forward between Devon Loch 's ears , until the visor of his cap was almost touching the horse 's nose . He held on and straightened up , but with such gyrating arm and body movements that he looked as if he were fighting off a swarm of bees . Devon Loch tried to rise , front legs drawn in , hind legs still extended out behind , flat as a seal 's flippers . While Francis was struggling for balance , Devon Loch drew in his left hind leg with a momentary writhing motion , a slight half-pivot , and regained his balance . He stood motionless . // The subsequent winner came by , a good , well-backed horse named E.S.B. , whose time was only a second off the best in the 117-year history of the Grand National . But forget him . The 1956 Grand National will always be Devon Loch 's . If he had taken a few more strides he would not only have won  --  the first royal horse to do so since Ambush II won for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have smashed all records in doing it . And as it was , he provided THE MOST DRAMATIC GRAND NATIONAL OF ALL , as The Sporting Life headlined it , with characteristic British restraint , or , in the words of the Liverpool Daily Post , " the greatest tragedy in the history of sport . " // While 250,000 people looked on in awed silence , Devon Loch 's girths were loosened . For seven or eight minutes the horse seemed unable to move . The official racing notebook of the Queen Mother reads , " He was all at sea and seemed temporarily to have lost the use of his hind legs .... The cause will forever remain a mystery . " Mrs. Mirabel Topham , the owner of Aintree , said she considered it " one of the most astounding spectacles in the history of worldwide racing . " So did millions of watchers of the newsreels . When Devon Loch finally was taken to his stall , the veterinarians could find nothing whatsoever wrong with him . " I do n't think it will ever be explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's an absolute mystery . " // What happens if you find yourself and a horse the central characters in an impenetrable mystery ? Lately there has been one unexpected consequence ; Dick Francis has come back into public attention as the author of horse-racing mysteries himself . He has now published six of these novels , four of them in the past three years , and authorities in this branch of letters say they are the best books of their kind ever written . Literary critics have not paid much attention to them , but they have been translated into Italian , German , Finnish , Danish , Spanish , Dutch , Swedish and Japanese , and Francis has acquired an enthusiastic following , headed by that eminent baritone and horse owner , Bing Crosby . The reviews they get are generally those capsule comments on this week 's mysteries that appear in the back pages of book-review sections . There the exacting specialists on detective stories usually give them high marks . One said recently that it was time to stop asking how it came about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask how it came about that such a good writer became a jockey . Last fall , when Francis ' Blood Sport was published in England , the London Times reviewed it at some length , suggesting that Francis was really a literary rather than a racing figure and concluded : " Blood Sport is a first-class novel , never mind the horses . " // The lesson would seem to be that if you become mixed up in a mystery you can not solve , write one yourself . Dick Francis writes his books in a comfortable , compact little house on the outskirts of the village of Blewbury , about an hour 's train ride from London . He is a forthright , energetic individual , with a narrow , tapering jockey 's frame , broad shoulders , an abundant thatch of thick black hair and lean , triangular features on which you can see faint crisscrossed scars where skilled surgeons have sewed up the wounds left from falls on many fine Thoroughbreds . He tends to sit well forward in a chair , his back straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting in a saddle , whenever he plunges into a literary discussion . The great question about his books , of course , is : what light do they throw on the Devon Loch mystery ? The answer is a complex one , except in the sense that his bafflement with Devon Loch generated them all . // " A horseman can tell  --  as soon as he picks up a book or a newspaper , he can tell  --  whether the person writing knows about horses , " Francis said . His English readers know that he knows what he is talking about . Francis was the Queen Mother 's jockey , the jockey of the late Lord Bicester , whose horses were the best in the kingdom , and the champion jockey in the 1953-54 season , when he rode 76 winners in 331 races . He began racing as an amateur in 1946 , and when he retired 10 years later he had ridden in 2,305 races , with 345 wins , 285 seconds and 240 thirds , impressive totals for anyone 's steeplechasing career . Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . // During that decade Francis was a part of what the turf historian Ivor Herbert described as " a small busy itinerant circus of professionals and amateurs whizzing around the 50 tracks of Britain in a sort of mobile club . " The steeplechasing season extends from August to June , but flat racing commands public attention during the summer months , and steeplechasing is thought of as a winter sport , horses and riders hopping from Newton Abbot to Market Rasen to Stratford-on-Avon to Newcastle , Fontwell , Wolverhampton , Kempton , Taunton , Doncaster , Newbury and so on around , until the season reaches its climax in the classics of the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Grand National in the spring . Flat racers often stay a bit longer at one track than steeplechasers , who race a day or two at one place , move on to another and explore the British Isles , from Ayr in Scotland to Bangor-on-Dee in Wales with side trips to Ireland . // This is Dick Francis ' world , and while he may not know what happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other horses and riders at many other places . His novels evoke innumerable wintery racecourse scenes : the weighing rooms , with the cold , half-dressed jockeys gathered around a red-hot , potbellied stove ; a race in the rain at Bristol , when soaked and muddied jerseys and " a cold , steady , unrelenting wetness took most of the pleasure out of racing " ; a race in a February fog , one fence scarcely visible from the next , horses and riders moving in a lonely , private limbo , " an eerie , severed world in which anything might happen " ; a great day at Cheltenham , with bright sunlight , a holiday mood in the crowd and excitement almost crackling in the air . The events he writes about may be imaginary , but he knows precisely where they happened . // There is an inexplicable accident or a sinister racecourse conspiracy to begin with in each of the books  --  a wire stretched across a jump to bring down the horse that seemed certain to win , in Dead Cert ; the unaccountable suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , in Nerve ; the machinations of a gang moving in on a racecourse , in Odds Against ; the murder of a journalist investigating a doping scandal , in For Kicks ; graft and espionage intermingled with the shipment of racehorses to Europe , in Flying Finish ; the substitution of an inferior , look-alike horse for a $1.5 million stallion shipped to the U.S. , in Blood Sport . Racegoers are knowledgeable people , and such happenings in Francis ' books are subjected to a careful scrutiny by readers looking for flaws . That wire across the fence in Dead Cert , for example . " I wondered about that , too , " I said to Francis recently . " Would n't it have left a deep cut that would have given away the plot ? " // He looked surprised . " No , it would n't be as high as that , " he said . " It would catch his legs . But it would n't have to be all that absolutely dead tight , because it would catch his legs and would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midair altogether . " // In For Kicks a young Australian horseman is persuaded to come to England to masquerade as a stable lad where he listens in on discussions of dirty work at the tracks , such as waterlogging a horse with a bucket of water just before a race , nobbling him with a squirt of acid as he goes to the post , pouring half a bottle of whiskey down his throat or feeding him an apple stuffed with sleeping pills . From For Kicks there emerges such a picture of intoxicated , dazed , tranquilized , drowsy , stupefied and waterlogged horses stumbling around the track  --  though opponents of steeplechasing insist the races are like that even if the horses have not been tampered with  --  that the job of cleaning the stables appears to be too much for a Hercules , let alone young Dan Roke. // But Dan gives himself away because he rides too well to be the inexperienced stable lad he is pretending to be . // " How would that show itself ? " I asked Francis . // He appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads came in front of me , I 'd know which could ride , " he said . " It 's just how they get up , and how they sit there after they get up . " // Mrs. Francis , a pretty , relaxed and youthful-appearing woman , asked , " But how do you know a good rider from a bad rider , if you just see them riding out ? " // Well , it 's difficult to explain , " he said . " There are horses who have rather queer mouths . If you put a chap on them who has heavy hands , or rough hands , the horse turns his head about every which way . But if you put someone on him who 's got good hands , you 'll see that horse go away sweetly and behave himself and do what the chap on top wants , without any effort . You see someone with bad hands , he 'll take a long , long time to make that horse do what he wants him to . And then he probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roke did n't remember to make it look as if he could n't ride , and grab at everything , and say , ' Oh , come here ! ' A lot of horses are difficult to control or have been broken badly , but as soon as you see a good rider on the horse , the horse goes sweetly for him , or more sweetly than it does for a lot of other people . He passes the signals through his hands , and the horse thinks , ' That fellow on my back now is all right , and I 'm happy . ' " // Before writing Blood Sport , which is laid in part in the U.S. , Francis rode horses in the mountains near Jackson Hole , Wyo . " When Mary and I were on a vacation in the States , we had to change our plans because of the airplane strike , " he said , " and we traveled 7,000 miles by Greyhound bus . We stayed at a dude ranch , and I rode out with the men when they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at 5 o'clock to do it . " At the climax of the novel the stolen Thoroughbred is led along a path with a rock wall on one side and a 300-foot drop on the other . " I could n't have written that if I had n't been there . " he said . // Before writing Flying Finish Francis hired out as a groom to fly with a shipment of horses to Milan . " I know the people in the British Bloodstock Agency in London , " he said . " That 's where being in the horse world is a help . I asked them , ' Can I fly to Europe with some load of horses you 're sending over ? ' ' Oh , yes , ' they said , ' that will be all right . ' We flew to Milan one morning with eight horses , and then flew back with eight . The manager of the agency told me about the bonuses that are paid for exports  --  not only horses but all sorts of business . If you export to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the government . I thought , ' How about this ? This is a good idea . Suppose they just send the same animals back and forth , change their names and collect the bonus every time . ' I ca n't just write about anything , like someone walking down the street . I could n't have written Flying Finish if I had n't flown with the horses . " // Not that Francis considers his novels to be literary contributions . No one from The Paris Review has appeared at Penny Chase to interview him about his creative processes . This may be just as well , for when Dick Francis talks about his literary background , he seems to find it remarkable not that he wound up writing novels but that he learned to read and write at all . // He was born in 1920 into a family of horsemen living near Tenby , a coast town in Wales in a region known as " the little England beyond Wales " because English-speaking immigrants who settled there in the Middle Ages never mastered the Welsh language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By ingenuity and by keeping busy around his father 's stables , Dick contrived to go to school only two or three days a week until he was 15 , at which age he quit forever . // " How did you get away with it ? " I asked . " Were n't there any truant officers in Wales ? " // " My father thought it was better for a boy to learn about riding than to learn about arithmetic , " he said . " He thought it was more beneficial . The big hunting days were Mondays and Fridays . The school week was Monday through Friday . I used to get up early on Monday and Friday mornings . I 'd see Father and ask if I could go hunting . ' Yes , boy , you can go hunting . ' Mother used to get annoyed , but Father thought it was more beneficial to me . I think probably he was right . " // His father was the manager of a famous hunting stable at Holyport . He bought young horses , trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were eight or nine nagsmen in the stable training hunters , and Dick and his brother Douglas ( later a noted trainer himself ) were allowed to school the young ponies that were too small for the heavier men to ride . Neither boy ever had a riding lesson . The senior Francis ' educational theories extended to horsemanship , and he believed in learning by trial and error alone . // When Dick was 12 years old and in the hospital  --  a pony named Tulip fell backward on him , breaking two teeth , his palate , jaw and nose  --  his convalescence was speeded by a chance to ride for a circus owner . Bertram Mills persuaded Dick 's father to let the boy ride his show ponies . Mills was a former undertaker who improvised a circus one year when postwar shipping difficulties prevented Ringling Brothers from reaching London . His circus became an institution , but as he grew wealthy his main interest turned to his show horses and the prizes they collected at fashionable shows . Dick 's job was to travel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then ride them in one show after another . For several years , also , he worked at showing hunters to prospective buyers , transporting the horses to the estates of customers and riding with the hounds to show what they could do . // It was a pleasant existence , and  --  aside from his disappointment that no one answered when he wrote to all the trainers he knew asking to become a jockey  --  Dick had no complaints . During the war , however , he began to regret his foreshortened education . He joined the Royal Air Force , expecting to become a pilot , and found himself an airframe fitter , cleaning , greasing , dismantling and reassembling airplanes . Eventually , after service as a mechanic in North Africa , he qualified for pilot training and says he tried to figure out latitude and longitude problems by counting on his fingers . He also trained as a pilot of troop-carrying gliders and wound up his war service piloting a bomber on diversionary raids over Germany and patrol duty over the North Sea . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amateur  --  at Woore , on October 17 , 1946 on a horse named Russian Hero that won the Grand National three years later . He finished fourth . On May 3 , 1947 , after he had ridden in 39 races and taken seven falls , he won his first race , at Bangor-on-Dee on a horse named Wrenbury Tiger . He had 62 races that season and won nine . Many of the people for whom he rode were farmers owning only a horse or two , for whom a professional jockey 's fee ( 10 for the winner , 7 for the others ) represented a sizable addition to their racing budget . During his second season Francis rode in 142 races , and the stewards of the National Hunt Committee , which runs British steeplechasing ( as well as the British Empire , according to legend ) , called him in and pointed out that he was taking rides away from jockeys who depended on their fees for their livelihood . He had to decide to become a professional or limit his racing to the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // He became a professional . That meant he no longer appeared on the programs as Mr. R. Francis but as plain R. Francis . Also , amateur riders can moonlight as racing writers , and professionals can not , but in those days nothing was further from Francis ' mind than writing about racing or anything else . The change was academic for some time in any event , for at Cheltenham during the transition period a promising brown gelding named Clare Dragoon fell at the fourth fence , with the result that neither Mr. Francis nor R. Francis , suffering a broken collarbone , did any riding for a while . // The next season he rode 23 winners in 117 races . He also got his first ride on a really fine horse  --  Silver Fame , a big pale chestnut , winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the best horse Lord Bicester ever owned . It was at Worcester on a fine October afternoon , and Francis was substituting for Lord Bicester 's regular jockey , who had a conflicting engagement in Ireland . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal of Silver Fame was announced after the race . " Francis found the occasion a good deal more troubling than the record indicates . As he cantered to the start , he noticed a trickle of blood on Silver Fame 's nose . It was slight , and the opportunity to ride was so important to him that he hated to do anything . But Silver Fame was so valuable that he asked the starter 's permission to withdraw and it was granted . // No damage was done , either to his reputation or to Silver Fame . That same afternoon he won on Lord Bicester 's Roimond , and two weeks later he won on Silver Fame at Stratford-on-Avon . Thereafter he rode regularly on the outstanding horses of Lord Bicester and other prominent owners . Among these was Finnure , on which in one season he won five of seven races . In Dead Cert the hero explains why he likes to ride any horse in any race : " The gripping happiness I always felt when cantering down to the starting gate . " And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts explains the sensation of riding a good one : " He was smooth and steely , and his rocketing spring over the first fence had me gasping . He landed yards out on the far side , collected himself without faltering , and surged ahead towards the winning post .... The utter joy of riding lay in the feeling of immense power which he generated . There was no need to make the best of things on his back , to fiddle and scramble and hope for others to blunder . " // That was Francis riding Finnure , his favorite of all he rode , or Lochroe , Silver Fame , Crudwell and Devon Loch . Roimond , another famous horse , was more complex , he says . Roimond was a magnificent animal ( a photograph of him and Francis leaping Becher 's Brook in the Grand National was plastered all over England , advertising Player 's cigarettes ) but moody and temperamental , so much so that Francis could scarcely believe he had a chance to win when he rode Roimond in the 1949 Grand National shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 starters that year , of which 11 completed the course ( including two that were remounted after falls ) . One ran out , one refused to jump Becher 's Brook the second time around , and 32 fell , one being killed . To Francis ' surprise , Roimond ran with enthusiasm , took the lead and in the last mile seemed on the way to winning . Just before the finish a horse passed him , going so fast that Francis knew he could not overtake him . The horse was Russian Hero , the winner , the first horse Francis had ridden in a race . Roimond finished second , eight lengths back . // Francis moved into big-time racing at an ideal moment . The 1949-50 season was accounted one of the best in steeplechase history , and the next was even better . For the first time crowds on cold winter afternoons began to equal the summer crowds at flat races . Credit for the revival of the sport went to Lord Mildmay , who , with Peter Cazalet , interested the royal family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest continued to grow as the royal horses , Monaveen , M'as-tu-vu and especially Devon Loch , began to win . // Lord Mildmay was a tall , lanky , quizzical individual , dedicated to riding the winner in the Grand National . He nearly won one year , but a recurring neck cramp , the consequence of a broken neck in a fall , left him almost paralyzed as his horse approached the finish . During the steeplechasing season Lord Mildmay hurried from race to race , as busy as the hardest-working professional jockey . He usually headed the list of amateur riders and piled up a lifetime total of 197 wins in 1,037 races . In 1932 he visited Peter Cazalet , who had a fine stable of his own , and remained with Cazalet 18 years . He rode out every morning at 6:30 , ate a boiled egg and drove off for the train to London , where he worked at his job in Barings bank . // Melodrama more sensational than anything in Francis ' mysteries broke on the horse world on May 12 , 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and had just finished his most successful year in the season then ending . It was believed he had suffered a neck cramp while going for a morning swim at his estate on the Devon coast , but his body was never recovered . // Lord Mildmay left his horses to Cazalet , who asked Francis to ride Statecraft for him in the Cheltenham Gold Cup . His regular jockey had been injured . Statecraft pulled a tendon halfway through the race , but the occasion led to Francis ' riding regularly for Cazalet and ultimately for the Queen Mother . He never rode Monaveen , the first horse owned by a Queen of England in 235 years , but he won on M'as-tu-vu in his first race at Kempton Park . Still , it was Devon Loch with which he was irrevocably associated in the public mind , partly on the strength of two splendid races in which he rode the horse to successive victories before the Grand National , partly because Francis reached the peak of his racing career just as Devon Loch was coming into his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far back as 1952 , when he formed a working partnership with Crudwell , a former flat racer , a lightly framed , delicate animal . Francis won nine of Crudwell 's first 10 races after Crudwell became a chaser . In all , Francis won 15 races on the horse , who finished his career with 43 victories , more than any other chaser had since the beginning of this century . During the season of 1953-54 ( when Francis became champion jockey ) another small , lightly built racer named Lochroe added some impressive totals to those of Crudwell . Francis , who began the season with seven wins and two seconds in six days , coaxed Lochroe to a victory in his first race , a novice hurdle , at Fontwell Park . Two weeks later he rode Lochroe at Stratford-on-Avon and won again . Two weeks after that , at Nottingham , he rode Lochroe to his third successive victory , beginning a record streak that did not end until Lochroe was finally retired with 30 victories in 58 races . By Christmas , halfway through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Lochroe graduated to steeplechasing the following October , Francis rode him to three more successive triumphs . // But winning was not always that easy . As champion jockey , Francis rode Rose Park , one of the two English horses invited to an International Steeplechase at Belmont in 1954 . It was an English debacle : the horses had not recovered after a disastrous 32-hour flight , and American fences added a finishing touch . The birch sticks that top English fences must be cleared , but in the U.S. they are loose and horses can brush through them without injury . " We were wasting time going up in the air over each obstacle , " Francis said , " and the American horses were shooting by below us. " // There were setbacks of other kinds . Francis fell with Roimond , the co-favorite , in his second Grand National ( in which only seven of 49 starters finished the course ) , and in the Grand National the following year he fell with the surefooted Finnure in an 11-horse pileup at the first fence . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broke his arm , his wrist , his collarbone ( 10 times ) and numerous ribs and dislocated both shoulders , which are still prone to pop out of place painfully with any violent arm movement . And the year after he was champion jockey , his record of wins dropped to only 33 in 283 rides from the previous year 's total of 76 in 331. // But the next season  --  that is , the year of his 1956 ride on Devon Loch in the Grand National  --  began brilliantly : by Christmas he had won 27 races . Francis first rode Devon Loch when the horse returned to racing after a two-year layoff . It was a novice hurdle at Newbury , and they finished sixth , but Francis was so impressed by Devon Loch 's speed and endurance  --  and by his alert intelligence  --  that he thought Devon Loch could become a Grand National winner . Devon Loch 's next race was at Hurst Park , where he beat 12 good horses , including Lochroe , which Francis was riding . In preparation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devon Loch to his peak . Francis rode him in the first of these , a hurdle at Sandown , in which he finished fourth . A week later Francis rode Devon Loch again at Lingfield , in Devon Loch 's first three-mile steeplechase , and he won by four lengths . Three weeks later , with Francis riding him again , Devon Loch won a big race at Sandown from a field that included some famous horses : Cottage Lace , Mariner 's Log , Armorial III , Hipparchus and Domata. // Francis did not ride Devon in the next two races of his buildup . In one , the King George VI at Kempton Park , he was again on Lochroe , who fell . Devon Loch , after faltering midway , was no better than fifth . Francis was recuperating from a series of falls when the next big race , the Mildmay Memorial at Sandown , came along , and in this Devon Loch was third . But the first four horses went over the finish line less than two lengths apart , a neck separating Devon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exciting as these would probably have made Devon Loch a popular hero even if he had not been owned by the Queen Mother . As it was , each of his races was a sensation . Francis rode Devon Loch once again , his last race before the Grand National , a relatively quiet one in which Devon Loch was third to Kerstin . This was no disgrace , for Kerstin had three wins and two seconds in five races . // And so Devon Loch went into the Grand National . Every hotel in Liverpool had been sold out for weeks . Twenty-six special trains carried crowds to the city , not counting the royal train of 10 claret-colored cars bearing Queen Elizabeth , the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret . A party of Russian dignitaries , headed by Malenkov , watched from Mrs. Topham 's box . The 250,000 spectators in the huge , homely , weather-beaten stands at Aintree , consuming 500,000 bottles of beer during the day , made Devon Loch one of the favorites , after Must and Sundew . The weather was perfect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says there is never any relief from the tension of the Grand National , no matter how often you ride in it : " You have a last private word with your trainer , who looks as strained as you feel . Then you sit in the changing room and wait .... Rows of silent jockeys sit on the benches , with their elbows on their knees , and stare at their boots . Half an hour passes interminably .... " // There were 29 starters . Francis found Devon Loch taking the formidable Aintree fences as if they were merely hurdles . He had one anxious moment when Domata fell and rolled to where Devon Loch would normally have landed , but Devon Loch changed directions on his own , sidestepped and raced on without losing momentum . Armorial III , leading much of the way , fell at the 26th fence , and at the next fence Devon Loch took a commanding lead . Twenty yards from the last fence Francis could see that Devon Loch was going to meet it perfectly and he thought the race was won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fence as easily as if it were the first instead of the 30th . Francis was conscious of the waves of cheering rolling from the stands and of the finish line a few yards ahead . And then Devon Loch suddenly stopped . // I had intended to go to the King George VI at Kempton with Francis . It is the last big race of the year , and he has had all sorts of associations in both his novels and his career with this track outside London . There he won for the first time riding M'as-tu-vu for the Queen Mother . It was the first time she saw the horse win . Francis was startled by the tremendous roar from the crowd , so much louder than the usual cheering for a winner that he thought something extraordinary must have happened in the field behind him . There , too , he rode Devon Loch in a thriller when he was barely beaten by Rose Park . And Kempton was the scene of wins on horses he remembered and liked to talk about : Finnure , Lochroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hoof-and-mouth epidemic , but Francis decided to drive the 30 miles or so across undulating farm country to Kempton ; it had been one of the tracks that was the model for the imaginary course he pictured in Odds Against . This deals with the fiendish tricks of a gang trying to take over a racecourse so they can start a housing project on the grounds . They plug up the drains , softening the ground behind a jump , so a horse 's forefeet sink 18 inches into the ground and break . They sabotage the safety valves of the boiler , hoping to blow up the place on a cold winter race day . The climax is a movie chase with the hero , a private investigator , dodging shots through labyrinthine passages under the stands . // The old steepletop Edwardian building , flanked by gleaming new glass-and-metal stands , fronting a broad , parklike expanse of uneven grass that was shining in the hazy sunlight , looked like a good setting for a mystery . Deserted and windblown on a day that should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to symbolize steeplechasing as a threatened sport that is in some danger of being crowded off the map . Francis led the way into the weighing room , an expanse of worn wooden floor and wooden benches , at the side of which stood a huge scale with an armchair mounted on it , suggesting some sort of crude throne to be used in the rituals of a bankrupt fraternal order . Steeplechase jockeys sit down to be weighed . " They used to have balance scales , " Francis said . " You sat in the chair and they piled weights on the other arm until they balanced . " // Francis ' imagination is strictly literal ; when he describes a scene he duplicates some place he knows . He writes his books in pencil , trying to write something every day , but often working at night , or waking early and writing until 7:30 , when he rides at a neighbor 's farm to clear the cobwebs out of his head . Mystery stories require a lot of rearrangement , so the margins of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be transferred , like hand-drawn maps giving directions for reaching some place over country roads . In the boiler room beneath the stands he demonstrated where he had imagined his hero to be hiding while gangsters raced down a passage looking for him . " There is n't any passage here , of course , " he said apologetically , " but there is at Doncaster . The course in Odds Against is really a combination of the two . When you leave the weighing room at Doncaster you walk through a long tunnel to the saddling ring , and that 's where they were waiting for him . " // We went outside and walked the course . The fences looked enormous , with the dried gorse that had withered on their sides and the spiky woven thick sticks of blackened birch branches that formed their wide , wall-like tops . // " The ideal takeoff point would be about here , " Francis said , standing eight feet in front of one . " A horse can get as close as half this distance and still get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close as that , because he 's bound to hit some part with his legs and lose his spring and momentum . The more experienced a horse is and the more experienced the jockey , the better chance there is of getting the horse going  --  working  --  so he meets the fence in his stride . You 'll find an experienced horse putting himself right for this fence as far as 150 feet back there . You can feel him getting his stride right , and just as you take off you squeeze him and say "  --  here he crouched down and uttered a deep growl  --  " ' Go on ! ' And you 'll find he has gained a length on the other ones on the jump . " // Horses and mysteries have been associated in the literary imagination ever since the fall of Troy . There appears to be a limitless supply of mystery-story plots in the stories of dubious bets , crafty frauds , ringers , thefts , ingenious swindles , conspiracies , doping and other misdoings that bubble up spontaneously wherever lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Francis ' novels I had gotten an impression of jockeys going through one too many frustrations , falling once too often , racing too many times on cold winter days  --  and returning to the dressing room and calling it quits . " No , it is n't like that at all , " he said . " You always want to ride . But 40 is old age for a jockey . You get fewer and fewer rides , and the horses are not as good , and you have perhaps one ride where you used to have three or four a day , and finally you have to stop . But you always want to ride . " // Francis himself continued to ride after Devon Loch 's inexplicable stop . In fact , he won a race three days later on a horse he was previously committed to ride . He rode in a few more races before the season ended , winning eight , including the Welsh Grand National on Crudwell . But there were not nearly so many as he would have ridden in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started out as usual . He had a fair number of races , won 22 and was the leading jockey for a time . But he had a number of bad falls , and at 36 he found that he did not come back from them as quickly as he had in the past . His two sons were growing up ( the older rode in his first race as an amateur last August , finishing third ) and after a fall at Newbury , when a gifted jumper named Prince Stephen fell with him , kicked him in the stomach and broke his wrist , pressure was brought on him to stop while he was still alive . // " I spent an evening with Lord Abergavenny , who 's one of the powers in racing , " he said . " He 's a man of great authority . He told me I had only a few more years at best , and strongly urged me to retire while I was ahead . I knew he was right , but I did n't want to believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ; I did n't want to face it . After I retired I kept going to the races and just standing around . " // A short time later , Clive Graham , the racing writer for the London Daily Express , asked him to write a weekly column for the Sunday Express . After a few columns appeared , a literary agent , John Johnson , asked him to write his autobiography . Johnson 's mother knew Francis ' mother . That seems to be a precondition of English literary life  --  that somebody knows someone 's family . " A chap came here , a ghostwriter , " Francis said . " He told me what to do , and what he would do , and prepared to move in . Well , I could n't have that . The upshot was I had to write it myself . " // When the first chapters arrived , Johnson was surprised at their quality . He had expected a major rewriting job would be necessary and instead found a good book . He was right ; Francis ' autobiography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unadorned story , especially in the early chapters of recollections of a boyhood among horses , though later technical descriptions of courses are likely only to interest people who want to jump . // Some impression had persisted that when Francis visited the royal box after Devon Loch 's abrupt stop the atmosphere was chill . The book says that was not true at all . When Devon Loch stopped , the stands grew silent . An observant journalist reported that Malenkov rose from his chair in Mrs. Topham 's box , but the array of Russian bodyguards around him remained impassive . Francis ' first thought was that Devon Loch 's hind leg was broken . He dreaded the long walk to the dressing room under the eyes of the crowd . Even after a routine fall in a small race he hated that ordeal . Ambulance drivers had a tendency to drive away if they saw a fallen rider get up , and he had told Mary not to worry if he lay still after a fall : he would just be waiting for a ride . So as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was relieved when the ambulance attendant offered to help him into the car . He was not crying  --  not then . " I was very grateful to him , " he said . " He drove me down through the people in the paddock , and in the dressing room I got about half undressed . I got off my silks . I think . Then I could n't do any more . I sat down on the bench . I was there for 10 minutes or so . Peter Cazalet came in when I was finally finishing dressing . He commiserated with me , and said , ' Dick , come along with me ; they want to see you . ' We went upstairs . They were all very kind and friendly . We commiserated , and talked for 15 minutes or so . Then Cazalet said , ' Let 's take a look at that horse . ' We went down to Devon Loch 's stall . There was nothing whatever wrong with him . " // In the evening after the race Francis and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time . To get away from the telephone , he and Mary walked down a country road beside the River Dee . // " Do you feel like jumping in ? " Mary says she asked . // " It looks a bit cold and wet , " he said , and that  --  except for sleepless nights , innumerable hours spent studying movies of Devon Loch 's slide , and a lifelong perplexed interest in everything having to do with the event  --  ended the psychological impact of the disaster . // The theories as to what caused Devon Loch to stop are innumerable . Long after the race , elderly colonels from India were still writing to Cazalet explaining what must have happened . The Queen Mother 's private secretary , Sir Martin Gilliat , said most theories " were products of imaginations more highly developed than Devon Loch 's . " One favorite was the ghost jump , a half lunge over a nonexistent obstacle . The run-in to the finish at Aintree is directly opposite the water jump on the inside track , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and dropped in confusion when he saw the jump was not there . Francis says this was impossible  --  the water jump is really a long distance from where Devon Loch stopped , and the horse was too intelligent and alert to have made such a shattering mistake . Other theories are that the horse had a heart attack or suffered a sudden cramp from some traumatic exhaustion . Cazalet says he is sure there was no cramp ; Devon Loch 's ears were up , he gave no sign of distress and his legs showed no heat or swelling or other abnormality . // Francis ' own theory is that Devon Loch ran into a kind of sound barrier . When they came over the last fence and the crowd saw that Devon Loch was going to win , the roar from the stands was a physical blast of sound . Near the finish it rose with such intensity that it may have made Devon Loch jump in the way a human being jumps involuntarily at any loud noise . // But Francis does not advance the theory very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference book , Chase-form , merely reads : // " Devon Loch , 7th wy ; 2nd 2nd C.T. ; led 3 out ; gng on whn slippd &amp; stoppd cl hme , " meaning Devon Loch was seventh at the halfway point , second at the second Canal Turn , took the lead at the third fence from the finish and was going on when he slipped and stopped . If you watch the films of the race in the BBC film library it seems as practical an explanation as any . Those two powerful hind legs gathered for a stride would wreak havoc if they slipped behind him . When you see the pictures of Francis groping around in the grass for his whip , you find yourself thinking of invisible barriers , rays , stuff out of science fiction , just the sort of thing to turn an imaginative person to writing mystery stories . // But walking around a racecourse with Dick Francis gives a different impression . His books are workmanlike mystery stories and make no pretense of being anything more . But they are rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every fence , hurdle and water jump occupies a concrete place in his mind . There is a latent poetry in them , compounded of love of racing , his feeling for it as an imperiled and misunderstood sport , his knowledge of horses and his own elemental kindliness and integrity . His literary ability is strictly controlled , but you can sense it , beneath the mechanics of the plot , like a horse being held back from going too fast at the wrong time . If Francis could still be riding , literature would never get more than a glimpse of him jumping a fence far in the distance . But on the other hand , if he keeps on writing and improving from book to book  --  and if he ever gives his imagination its head  --  Devon Loch may have made a greater contribution to sporting literature by stopping where he did than he could ever have made by winning .
