In a remote village in the west of Ireland , a light mist rose from the lake behind Hennessy Castle . The afternoon was becoming increasingly gray and brooding as clouds gathered and the skies turned threatening . Inside the castle the fireplaces were lit , providing a cheery warmth for the guests who were already anticipating a wonderful evening meal in the elegant eighteenth-century dining room . The massive front doors of the castle opened slowly , and newlyweds Regan and Jack Reilly stepped out onto the driveway in their jogging clothes . They 'd arrived on an overnight flight from New York , slept for several hours , and decided a quick jog might help alleviate the inevitable jet lag . Jack looked at his thirty-one-year-old bride , touched her hair , and smiled . " We 're in our native land , Mrs. Reilly . Our Irish roots lie before us . " Anyone who saw the handsome couple would n't have questioned those roots . Jack was six foot two , with sandy hair , hazel eyes , a firm jaw , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dark hair  --  she was one of the black Irish . " Well , it certainly is green around here , " Regan observed as she glanced around at the lush gardens , wooded trails , and rolling lawn . " Everything is so still and quiet . " " After last week , still andquiet sounds good to me , " Jack said . " Let 's go . " Together they broke into a jog and crossed a pedestrian bridge that traversed a stream in front of the castle . They turned left and headed down an isolated country road that the concierge told them led right into the village . The only sound was their sneakers hitting the pavement . At a curve in the road they passed an old stone church that looked deserted . Regan pointed toward the steepled building . " I 'd love to take a look in there tomorrow . " Jack nodded . " We will . " He glanced up at the sky . " I think that rain is coming in faster than we expected . This jog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ended at the tiny village , a graveyard with darkened gravestones proved irresistible to Regan . A set of stone steps to their left led up to a courtyard where a broken stone wall surrounded the cemetery . " Jack , let 's take a quick look . " " The funeral director 's daughter , " Jack said affectionately . " You never met a graveyard you did n't like . " Regan smiled . " Those tombstones must be centuries old . " They hurried up the steps , turned right , and stopped in their tracks . The first tombstone they spotted said reilly . " This is a good omen , " Jack muttered . Regan leaned forward . " May Reilly . Born in 1760 and died in 1822 . There do n't seem to be any other Reillys here with her . " " Just as long as there are n't any named Regan or Jack . " Regan was deep in thought . " You know that joke my father always tells ? The one about how an Irishman proposes ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the one . It looks like poor May did n't have anyone , not even a mother-in-law . " " Some people would consider that a good thing . " Jack grabbed Regan 's hand as large drops of rain started to come down . " Tomorrow we 'll spend as much time as you want here figuring out what went wrong in these people 's lives . Come on . " Regan smiled . " I ca n't help it . I 'm an investigator . " " So am I. " They did n't encounter a single soul as they ran through the tiny village , which consisted of a pharmacy , two pubs , a souvenir shop , and a butcher . They wound around and jogged back to the castle where they showered and changed . At 7:30 they went down to dinner and were seated at a table by a large window overlooking the garden . The rain had stopped , and the night was peaceful . Their waiter greeted them warmly . " Welcome to Hennessy Castle . I trust you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Regan answered . " But we stopped by the graveyard in town , and the first tombstone we saw had our name on it . " " Reilly ? " " Yes . " The waiter whistled softly . " You were looking at old May Reilly 's grave . She was a talented lacemaker who supposedly haunts the castle , but we have n't heard from her for a while . " " She haunts this place ? " Regan asked . " Apparently May was always complaining that she was n't appreciated . One of her lace tablecloths is in a display case upstairs in the memorabilia room . She made it for a special banquet of dignitaries who were visiting the Hennessy family , but May got sick and died before they paid her . Legend is that she keeps coming back for her money . " " Sounds like one of my cousins , " Jack said . " I do n't blame her , " Regan protested . " She should have been paid . " At 4:00 a.m . Regan woke with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain had started up again and sounded as if it was coming down harder than before . Regan slipped out of bed and crossed the spacious room to close the window . As she pulled back the curtain , a flash of lightning streaked across the sky . Regan looked down and in the distance saw the figure of a woman dressed in a long black coat , standing on the back lawn in front of the lake . She was staring up at Regan and shaking her fists . One hand was clenching a piece of white material . Could that be lace ? Regan wondered . " Regan , are you all right ? " Jack asked . Regan quickly turned her head away from the window , then just as quickly turned it back . Another bolt of lightning lit up the sky . The woman was gone . Jack flicked on the light . " Regan , you look as if you just spotted a ghost . " Before she could answer , the smell of smoke filled their nostrils . A moment later the fire alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jack said quickly . " Let 's throw on some clothes and get out of here ! "
