Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin is considered one of history 's great gastronomes . The 18th century Frenchman , however , spent years as a lawyer before openly pursuing his epicurean calling . It 's a trajectory scores of Americans have traveled in recent years as they abandoned the corporate world and sought greater happiness at cooking academies . But if Brillat-Savarin were around today , he would probably skip the law and head straight to the kitchen . The fastest-growing population in the nation 's cooking schools is young people who refuse to do time as lawyers , orthopedists or even traditional college students but instead proceed directly from high school into culinary academies . In 1997 , only 22% of applicants to the Culinary Institute of America ( CIA ) in Hyde Park , N.Y. , were recent high school graduates . Today that number is 38% . At the California Culinary Academy ( CCA ) in San Francisco , nearly 20% of the 1,910 students in last year 's incoming class matriculated straight from high school  --  a marked increase from 2000 , when that number was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , R.I. , the most common age of culinary students has hovered in recent years between 17 and 19 , and Meredith Moore , school spokeswoman , boasts that these applicants are coming in with high SAT scores and extracurricular activities that could easily earn them admission to top colleges . <P> The publicity generated by the Food Network and chefs with their own books , frozen-food lines and cookware helps explain why many young people view cooking not just as a way to make a living but also to make their name . And while for centuries chefs learned their craft apprenticing in the kitchens of great restaurants , some members of the new generation believe that a degree from a top school will boost their credibility in the profession  --  and give them instant access to a wide network of alumni . " Being a chef now is like being a rock star , " says Nancy Seryfert , vice president of admissions at the California Culinary Academy . Says Tim Ryan , president of the CIA , the nation 's most esteemed culinary school : " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested in the profession . And perhaps more interesting  --  and important  --  so are their parents . " <P> Even the most establishment-minded parents would be gratified to see how intensely students pursue their cooking classwork . While sophomores at traditional four-year universities skillfully avoid scheduling classes before 10 a.m. , students at culinary schools willingly rise before dawn to laminate pastry dough . On their own time , they cheerfully practice the sauteing , flambeing and knife-wielding skills they have learned in class .
