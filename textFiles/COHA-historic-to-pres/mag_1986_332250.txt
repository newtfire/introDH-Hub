Geese toting M-16s ? Well , not quite , but after a successful trial run , gaggles of geese will soon begin guard duty at American military installations in West Germany . Eventually , 900 of the squawking waterfowl , in platoons of six to 40 , will take up posts at 30 sites run by the U.S. Army 's 32nd Air Defense Command . The idea is not as ludicrous as it may seem . With their acute sense of hearing , geese when startled sound the alarm by hissing , honking loudly and flapping their wings . Indeed , the ancient Romans used geese as guards . The web-footed sentinels are said to have saved Rome by raising a noisy commotion as the Gauls approached the city walls in 390 B.C. What is more , the entire goose patrol will cost the Army about half the annual tab for a single trained guard dog .
