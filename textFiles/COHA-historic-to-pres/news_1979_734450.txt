WASHINGTON ? After , 30 months as director of the Office of Civil Rights for the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , David Tatel is resigning to return to private law practice . Tatel was the driving force behind the federal government 's push to desegregate Chicago 's schools . For more than a decade , Tatel has been a civic rights activist , including a brief stint in Chicago as director of the lawyers Committee for Civil Rights . His wife taught at a black school on the South Side , and today his six-year-old son is bused to school in Silver Spring , Md . In an Interview , Tatel discussed a wide range of topics involving the Chicago school desegregation case , which HEW recently referred to the Justice Department , Q ? President Carter is facing an election year . Some expect political clout to take priority over enforcing school desegregation . This happened In 1965 when Chicago officials convinced HEW to restore some funds that had been cut off . This happened again in 1969 when Atty . Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Department . Do you think there will be a repeat of this ? A ? No , I do n't think so . There are some big differences between what happened before and what is happening now . In the first situation ? 1965 ? HEW 's case was based purely on numbers which showed what we know to be the case , that is , the schools in Chicago are segregated . The department had not collected any evidence we now have which shows that segregation is intentional . So the legal basis for HEW 's action then was very different and not as secure as it is now . The second case you . referred to was when the attorney general refused to move . I believe that was a teacher desegregation issue .. . . Here you have an administration that is committed to enforcing the laws which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race . And it is doing so in this case with a factual record that is one of the best that has been developed anywhere in the country . Q ? You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HUD , and the VA , and make a case that the government has aided and abetted school segregation . Would n't you say that the federal government then is as much a party to the current school problem in Chicago as the city school officials ? A ? No . I agree that certain housing and other practices of the federal government have contributed to the creation of racially segregated housing . But it is certainly not the case that the federal government is as responsible as the board of education . It was the board of education that built schools and located them to be sure that some would open up all black and others all white , not the federal government , It was the board that gerrymandered its attendance areas , not the federal government . And it certainly was n't the federal government that bused black children out of overcrowded black schools , past white schools with classrooms , to other black schools . ( 1 ? The Chicago school system is 19 per cent white , and some argue it is impossible to desegregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desegregate the system , why did n't HEW show how this could be accomplished instead of sending Chicago a feasibility plan that left 232 elementary schools still segregated ? A ? First , it is possible and practical to // Election will not stall busing fight : expert // desegregate a majority black school district for exactly the same reasons it is possible to desegregate a majority white school district . There are , true , only 19 per cent white enrollment in the district but that is almost 100,000 students . That is more white students in the Chicago school system than there are students in , say , Columbus Ohio , which the Supreme Court just ordered desegregated . The difficulty a court or an agency or a school district faces with declining white enrollment is not that desegregation can not be accomplished ? because it can ? but that the amount of desegregation you accomplish is limited , and that is why the feasibility study we developed showed that you could only desegregate 60 per cent of the schools and 55 per cent of the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncorrected for so many years , the number of whites remaining in the system is not sufficiently high to desegregate the whole system . Q ? So you are saying you can not desegregate the whole system ? A ? That is right , but you can certainly desegregate a major part of it . Q ? Ilow do you answer the argument that court-ordered busing will result in more white flight from the school system std make desegregation counterproductive ? A ? I think that one can fashion a desegregation plan that minimizes the white flight , and the way to do that is to be conscious of the racial characteristics of the desegregated schools , which were in our feasibility study , to avoid long-distance busing , which we did . But more important , to be sure that the board of education , community leaders , and other people who affect public opinion are supporting desegregation and not frightening the community with fears of what might happen . Q ? Government critics in Chicago have said that HEW officials who have been working on the school case really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Harris and yourself , and this is one reason there has been so much Insensitivity . How do you respond to this ? A ? School officials all over the country , when they disagree with us , first say that we are ignorant of their school system . That is always their first defense . In fact , this case was put togethQ. &A.; er by our Chicago regional office , which consists of people who live and work in Chicago . Second , I spent quite a few years in Chicago and know the public school system . The secretary went to school in Chicago and has a good sense of the Chicago public school system . But more important than all of those , you do n't need to be a Chicagoan to read and understand the implications of HEW 's findings . Discrimination is discrimination , and you do n't need to be a Chicagoan to be able to identify it , The Supreme Court is able to approve desegregation orders ? from Topeka . Kan. , is 1954 , to Columbus , , Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the justices are from either of those cities . . . . The question is , what are the facts ? Do they amount to any legally segregated system , and if so , what kind of remedy is required ? You do n't need to be from Chicago to answer any of those questions . Q ? Is there really a remedy when busing , such as In Boston , can generate violence ? A ? For every Boston , there are many more instances of nonviolence . . Columbus and Dayton are desegregated schools . We have not heard of any instances of violence there . . . . What we do know is : If the school district resists , if the school district and officials responsible for it and the newspapers tell the public that if we desegregate , whites will flee ; if we desegregate , there will be violence in the schools , it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . Most of those things will happen if public officials say they will . Q ? Looking back over tills lung dispute , what could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a court battle ? A ? The reason we were not able to solve the problem is that the board of education is not witting to desegregate to any significant degree the large number of predominantly white schools on the Northwest and Southwest Sides . And without desegregating those schools , v e r y little - desegregation can be achieved in the system . You simply can not , in a district that is 19 per cent white , consider a school that is 90 per cent white to be desegregated.
