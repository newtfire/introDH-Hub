By normal standards of public relations , the brochure of the projected school was certainly strange . It advertised no buildings , laboratories or equipment , frankly admitted that the school had virtually none of these things to offer . Instead , it said , prospective students would have to count on building most of the plant themselves . Nonetheless , last week nine sturdy teen-aged students were already out in Colorado paying $350 for the privilege of creating-practically from scratch-the Colorado Rocky Mountain School . <P> To Founders John and Anne Holden , both 42 , all this was not meant to be just an easy way of getting themselves a campus . Both former teachers at Vermont 's Putney School , they had long since come to the conclusion that a little creative manual labor is just what modern education needs . This year , after months of planning , they pooled their slim savings , bundled their two children and furniture onto a truck , set out to transplant the Putney idea in the West . The place they picked was a log ranch house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fork Valley , 30 miles northwest of Aspen . <P> Busy Students . When they first sent out their brochures , they quickly learned that they would be free from at least one problem : 35 teachers applied for free jobs , and nine camp counselors liked the idea so much that some of them offered to come out free for the summer , just to get things started . The Holdens accepted the counselors , hired four of the teachers , later added a nurse and a general secretary . By the end of June , they were all set for their first students to arrive to help put the campus in order . <P> Though the school does not actually open until fall ( full year 's fee : $1,550 ) , the students and counselors have already done a good deal more than a term 's work . They have planted a flourishing acre and a half garden and started storing up its vegetables in a neighbor 's home freezer . They have rebuilt the two chicken houses , converting one into a girls ' dormitory and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have built benches , desks , bunks and tables , have lined the ranch-house walls with book cases , installed cupboards , coat racks and window screens . They have cut and hauled several cords of wood , started clearing a ski trail , piled , loaded and sold 4,000 bales of hay to help fill up the school 's near-empty coffers . Meanwhile , they have also done their housework-cooking , cleaning and making beds . <P> When fall comes , the students will go right on with such chores . Though they will study the usual prep-school courses and get their share of skiing , riding and playing , they will also plant , sew , dig irrigation ditches , scrub floors , haul wood , tend horses , clear paths , pound nails , rake leaves , paint walls , and do any other manual labor the Holdens can think of . <P> Is all this too much to ask of students ? Not at all , says John Holden . " Work is nothing new . Coeducation is nothing new . Making your own entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition between home and college that provides students with some of the inner resources of which many people have been robbed by easy modern living .
