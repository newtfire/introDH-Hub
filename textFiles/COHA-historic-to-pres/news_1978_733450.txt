TRIM AND COMPACT , Hugo Zacchini , the Human Cannonball , vaults deftly onto the cab of his 1946 Diamond T truck and then to the top of the 22-foot , silver cannon mounted howitzer style on the truck 's back . He bounces ' slightly when he lands as if wearing springs on his feet . It is an old circus flourish . He acknowledges the crowd below . They are straining against the ropes , waiting to see a man impersonate Quaker Puffed Rice cereal . Zacchini is wearing a white horsehide jump suit and red shoes , and with a wave to his fans he pulls a red leather mask down tightly over his face . It resembles a World War I gas mask . Now he walks resolutely along the barrel to the mouth of the cannon and signals his assistant . The cannon 's barrel begins rising , and Zacchini disappears down inside its maw . The barrel rises until it stands at 45 degrees and seems tensed like a naval gun about to shell some far-off shore battery . " Ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the announcer commands the spectators , who are assembled within the vast enclosed Close-up With Jeff Lyon amusement park at Old Chicago in Bolingbrook . THERE IS A DEAFENING blast , and Zacchini bursts from the cannon muzzle amid a cloud of theatrical smoke . Traveling at , near 90 M.p.h. he sails upwards with his arms extem.td Superman style , narrowly missing the yellow vimfl banners and acoustical cubes slung from the lofty ceiling . Now he begins his descent , over the potted dwarf trees and Victorian benches , landing finally in the middle of a broad nylon net . The net sags like an old flophouse bed , nearly swallowing up Zacchini , then it espels hini like a watermelon seed and he goes up again , bouncing twice before his momentum stops . He has trained 170 feet .. It is a terrific act , and cheers fill Zacchini 's ears as he dismounts from the net with a wave and runs off to the dressing room . Someone notices he has rubbers on his feet as he unlocks the door . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked . " Huh ? " he says , looking down . He laughs . " Naw , I just now put ' em on . To keep my shoes clean . In the circus , you got ta think of things like that . " HE SITS DOWN HEAVILY in a green and white captain 's chair . " Whew , there 's got to be an easier way to make a living , " he says in a drawl  --  the product of a lifetime in Tampa . Someone dares to mention that he seemed to be a little shaken up this afternoon , right after he landed in the net . He snorts . " It was n't from being fired out of // Cannonball 's act no longer a blast // the cannon , " he says . He creases his eyes with his thumb and forefinger , and his voice grows rueful : " I 'll tell you what I 'm shaken up from . I stayed out too late and drank too Much last night . This morning I was sick . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . But I 'm OK now . " Ever since he was 20 years old , Hugo Zacchini has been sliding into a cannon barrel and getting hurtled out again by a force of compressed air equal to 250 pounds per square inch . He wo n't say how old he is now , but the gray has a beachhead in his dark Italian hair and his forehead is etched with wrinkles . HE 'LL BE QUITTING soon , he says . " I have 10-year-old aches that I still have n't gotten rid of , " he says . " What I 'll do is get some young guy to go up , and I 'll fire the cannon , like my dad did after he broke his leg . " His dad is Edmondo Zacchini. today 84. some 55 years ago staged what was the world 's first Human Cannonball act . The idea for the act is even older . It was the brainchild of " Papa " Ildebrando Zacchini , patriarch of the Zacchini clan and himself a noted circus performer in the family 's native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two daughters , all of whom he had trained in the circus arts , that he had a wonderful idea for a thrilling new act , in which a human being would be fired out of a cannon . Son Edmondo took it so seriously he went to night school at the ? University of Turin and gained an engineering degree , and with his new knowledge he developed a cannon to do the job . In 1922 , in Egypt . Edmondo unveiled the act for the first time , firing off his brother . The act has since made the Zucchinis world famous . They joined Ringling Bros. in the United States , settling in Tampa . For many years the entire family toured with their cannons . But age and mishaps have taken their toll , and today Hugo is the only Zacchini left performing . HUGO GOT SOME UNUSUAL publicity last summer when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in his favor in a lawsuit he filed against an Ohio television station which ran footage of his whole act during a newscast . He contended this damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is if you run five seconds of film , you 've shown Hugo 's entire act . It is brief . But it is also spectacular , even if , as he says , it 's not that dangerous . He has been injured only once , he says , breaking an ankle and crushing a disc in 1965 when the Let collapsed . " The net 's the dangerous part , " he says . " If the cannon 's working well , it should n't hurt you , but then you 've built up this great speed and , when you hit the net , it can hurt . Try diving into a net from 50 feet up ? which is the top of my arc . " One reason his act is n't all that perilous , Hugo says , is that it is controlled . It follows strict physical laws . His body describes a parabola in the air , and Hugo , who has an engineering degree from the University of Florida , can calculate where he will land by the angle of the cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air friction generated . The cannon works entirely on compressed air , like a popgun . Black power is exploded at the same time , but only for dramatic effect . " We 've never used it to actually fire the cannon . " Hugo says . " The acceleration 's too fast . It would break your bones . " HUGO RISES PAINFULLY out of the captain 's chair , muttering something about needing some BenGay . He follows some of the Old Chicago people to the beer garden where they are staging a buffet to celebrate the amusement park 's new season . He loads up on roast beef , ham , potato salad , and celery and has just sat down and dug in when a child 's balloon goes off at the next table with a sharp bang . Hugo leaps out of his chair with a startled expression .
