ALBANY , March 26 ? Governor Dewey signed into law today ten bills embodying his program for solving New York City 's financial crisis by setting up an authority to take over the deficit-plagued municipal transit system and authorizing a new $60,000,000 payroll tax and a $50,000,000 increase in real estate imposts . The increase in taxing powers and the other financial relief measures for the city are contingent upon the city 's acceptance of the transit authority proposal . Unless the transit system is transferred to the authority by June 1 , the city 's right to impose the payroll tax will lapse , and an increase in the real estate tax will be prohibited . But before the Governor placed his signature to the bills today , the city , by an 11-to-5 vote in the Board of Estimate , had indicated a reluctant acceptance of this condition even though it probably means a politically unpopular rise lin fares to overcome next year 's prospective transit operating defi1cit of $50,000,000 . Under the provisions of the main authority law , any fare change this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thereafter , fare changes could be made only between Jan. 1 and June 30 of any year . The authority itself would have full control over the fare . At present the Board of Transportation , which now operates the lines , can propose a change of fare , but the change can not become effective until it is approved by the Mayor . I Fare changes , while the lines remain in city control , can take effect only on July 1 of any year . In a memorandum accompanying his action on the ten measures , Governor Dewey again accused the city administration of failing to submit any " workable " program of its own to meet an anticipated // deficit of $200,000,000 ? that is his figure ; the city has been using $173,000,000 . The memorandum declared the authority plan would put the city 's transportation system on a business-like basis . It emphasized that authority operation first had l been proposed by the city , although in a different form , Likewise , the memorandum : stressed that the idea for a payroll tax was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan Borough President Robert F. Wag- , ner Jr . As proposed by Mr. Wag- , I ner last December , it was noted , ) the tax would have been larger and would have fallen entirely onl employes . Referring to the city 's decision to avoid the payroll tax , Mr. Dewey said he would be happy if economies should make it unnecessary , but he declared it was an honest tax . " The difference between the city administration and the state government on this issue , " he went on , " is that the city would advocate hidden taxes and living on borrowed money , and I consider such a program deeply damaging to the city , both financially and morally . The people are entitled to good government , and they are entitled to know its cost right out in public . " Rebukes ' Glib Solutions ' The Governor 's memorandum contained an obvious rebuke for City . Council President Rudolph Halley and Mr. Wagner . the two members of the Board of Estimate who voted against using the transit authority legislation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solvency through glittering generalities and glib solutions make no contributions to the welfare of the people of the city , " Mr. Dewey declared . One of the bills that became law today requires Governor Dewey and Mayor Impellitteri to appoint two members each to the new transit authority by April 20 . If these four should fail to agree by May 1 on the selection of a fifth person to complete the authority 's membership , Howard S. Cul/man , chairman of the Port of New York Authority , automatically will become the fifth member . In addition to the power to impose a .5 per cent payroll tax , divided equally between employer and employe  --  a power the city administration has announced it will not use  --  and authority to increase real estate taxes  --  which it is planning to use  --  the city receives the right to fund $39,000,000 in accumulated pension liabilities of the transit system . When the authority takes over the transit lines it will be responsible for meeting all pension costs out of operating revenues . The $50.000.000 increase in city real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's legislation that authorized the funding of the $45,000.000 transit operating deficit anticipated in the fiscal year ending June could ' raise next year 's real estate tax rate by 45 cents for each 0100 of assessed valuation . In accordance with a schedule worked out last year , the city 's debt-service budget next year must provide 140,000,000 to redeem bonds issued to liquidate this year 's transit operating deficit and $2 , - 100,000 , plus interest , to liquidate transit operating deficits of past years . These amounts can be taxed against real estate outside the limitation on real estate taxes for general operating expenses . One of the new measures approved on Mr. Dewey 's recommendation is a constitutional amendment increasing the limit on real estate taxes for operating expenses from 2 to 21 per cent of averaged assessed valuations . This must receive approval of the voters this fall before it can become operative . However , one of the bills that Mr. Dewey approved today authorizes the city to impose a $50,000,000 county real estate levy should the amendment be defeated . Taxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided in the amendment would amount to $49 , - 000.000 in the fiscal year beginning July 1 , and $100,000,000 a year thereafter . But under another of the bills approved today the city would never be able to use more than $50,000,000 of this amount without further action by the Legislature . Bonds that the city could issue Under the pension-funding bill would not begin to fall due until the fiscal year that begins July 1 , 1954 . They would become additional charges against real estate , outside the tax limit , as they matured . Another restriction on city borrowing imposed by legislation approved today bars the issuance after June 30 of any budget notes for the payment of a transit-operating deficit , and limits the total amount'of budget notes that can be issued in any one year to $15 , - . 000,000 , except with the approval of the State Controller , Budget notes are temporary loans redeemable entirely from the succeeding year 's tax levy and , unlike serial bonds , are a charge against the tax limit . The only bill in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today provides for the appointment by the Governor of a state commission of five members to study New York City finances , with particular attention to economies and improvements in efficiency that might result from the institution of some form of city manager government . Mr. Dewey 's approval of this measure is expected to be announced shortly . The ten measures approved today do these things : ( Authorize the imposition of a county real estate tax if the constitutional amendment should fail . ( Provide for the creation of a transit authority , with a mandate to balance operating costs and revenues . ( Modify the transit authorit ? bill to change the procedure for picking the fifth member , and require the city to make a minimum annual appropriation for new transit equipment or extensions . IlAuthorize the imposition of the payroll tax . ( Bar the use of the payroll tax unless the transit system is turned over to the authority . ( Limit the amount that can be taxed against real estate for oper11 ating expenses if the.constitutional amendment is approved . ( Bar the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit system is turned over to the authority . ( Impose restrictions on the use of budget notes . ( Prohibit borrowing for judgments , claims and repaving. ( authorize an issuance of serial bonds to fund accumulated city liabilities on account of transit pensions .
