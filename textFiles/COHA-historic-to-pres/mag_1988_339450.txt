Mainstream America has no fixed address , but Toledo provides as good a vantage point as any to watch the couch-potato campaign of 1988 . This slowly reviving industrial city of 338,000 has more than its share of card-carrying Reagan Democrats  --  and all of Michael Dukakis ' victory scenarios depend on wooing these blue-collar defectors back to the fold . But the struggle for their hearts and minds is oddly disembodied . Even a Dukakis visit to Toledo last week was merely a cameo for the cameras . Here , as elsewhere , the election has become largely reduced to the impressions created by the 300,000 tiny points of light on a television screen . <P> This living-room war last week produced a titanic battle  --  Wednesday night 's Donnybrook between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle  --  that might be called The Revenge of the Second Bananas . Bentsen was solid , senatorial and soothingly statesmanlike . Quayle , who often seemed as lost as an actor missing half the pages of his script , struggled to overcome his own Throttlebottom image  --  and lost . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favoring George Bush , but it did appear to have kept the race open as the two presidential contenders head toward their final face-off in Los Angeles this week . Wavering voters on the verge of committing to Bush may now pause , reflect and wait for the next act in the TV docudrama . <P> That certainly was the impression formed in one west Toledo household , where Betty and Raymond Heitger invited about a dozen of their friends and neighbors over to watch the heartbeat-away sweepstakes . Betty , a registered nurse , and Raymond , a high school math teacher , were Bush backers . Many of their guests were the kind of blue-collar voters and nominal Democrats who may swing the election . Typical was Greg Kretz , a 30-year-old carpenter , who said before the debate , " I like the job Reagan has done , but I do n't think that Bush has the same kind of leadership . " Yet Kretz was not committed to Dukakis either . " I 'm concerned about what he 's done as Governor , " he explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of Quayle 's failure to answer the opening question , the 15 voters in the Heitger living room provided play-by-play commentary . As soon as Quayle mentioned the pollution in Boston Harbor , Donna McManus , the wife of a policeman , exclaimed , " That 's the same as the campaign ad . " After an artful Bentsen attack on Bush 's ties to Panamanian General Manuel Noriega , Betty Heitger whispered to her husband , " You 've got to admit , this guy is very skilled . " Halfway through the debate , even the strong Bush partisans were dismayed as Quayle seemed to derail . Die-hard Republican Mike McManus said mournfully , " He 's screwing up . " <P> Bentsen dominated the postdebate sound bites with his attack on Quayle : " You 're no Jack Kennedy . " But these angry words triggered an audible intake of breath in front of the Heitger TV set . " That 's really low , " said Betty . Her neighbors agreed . Bush stalwarts like Mike McManus and Ray Heitger saw in Bentsen 's remark evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This allowed them to reconcile their discomfort over Quayle with their backing of Bush .
