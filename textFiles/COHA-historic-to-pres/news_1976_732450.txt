FOR 41 DAYS Vincent , Miraglia had a rubber balloon inflating and deflating in the big artery near his heart . Thanks to the balloon he has more lives than a cat . During his hospitalization at St. Francis Hospital in Evanston , Miraglia suffered at least 10 episodes of a runaway heart , all of which were bad enough to have killed him . But hospital doctors credit the balloon device for pulling him through . " After seeing it work I sure would like to have it handy in case I need lt , " one surgeon said . Miraglia , 53 , of 403 Hilton St. , Addison , suffered a massive heart attack early in February . He was taken to St. Francis when he went into cardiac shock . THIS TYPE of shock kills 00 per cent of its victims . Because of a massive heart attack , the heart muscle is badly damaged and is unable to pump a sufficient amount of blood to sustain life . The balloon , called an intra-aortic balloon assist device , Is designed to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tip of a long plastic tube into the femoral artery in Miraglia 's left leg . , The balloon carefully was pushed through the artery until it was abut ( 7 inches from the heart . The ballocn seas inflated each time Miraglia 's heart rgsted between beats . Every time his heart beat , the balloon was deflated to allow blood to pass . When the balloon is blown up , it pushes blood back toward the heart and into the coronary arteries feeding the heart muscle . AN ABUNDANT blood supply for the damaged heart is important to healing . The second job of the balloon is to push blood forward throughout the body . While he was on the balloon device , Miraglia suffered at least 10 episodes of fibrillation , a condition in which the heart flutters rapidly but does n't pump blood . An electric shock is applied to the chest to restart the heart . " Without the balloon assistance , his heart would not have been strong enough to survive the fibrillations . It 's amazing how well he did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt the balloon in his chest bue knew it was helping him . " It 's marveltius . It sure saved me. "
