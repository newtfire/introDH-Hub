WASHINGTON , July 22 ? There has been such a roll of drums from the Pentagon this week that it has overwhelmed what is really happening tem on Berlin . What is developing in the capital is not a dramatic crash program to fight a conventional war for Berlin but an orderly series of limited political , economic , and military moves to strengthen the alliance for a much wider test of will with the Communist bloc . Berlin is regarded here for the moment not as a military emergency but as a political opportunity . It may develop into a military crisis around , of all times , Thanksgtviiig Day , but for the time being it is being used to get a lot of things done that President Kennedy wanted to do , anyway , but could not get done without the lash of Khrushchev 's threats . Kennedy 's Goals Long before Khrushchev began tossing out his thunderbolt the majority of President Kennedy 's advisers estimated that the ground forces of the United States should be increased to around 1,000,000 men and reorganized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars . They wanted a minimum of thirty divisions facing the Russians on the German front instead of the eighteen they have there now . They wanted more missiles , larger atomic weapons in Europe , more strategic Air Force bombers in the air twentyfour hours a day , faster development of the West German Army , more French divisions transferred from Algeria to Europe , more financial aid from Germany to bring other British divisions into Europe . Khrushchev 's belligerent moves toward Berlin have now made all these things politically possible . They have even led de Gaulle and Adenauer to take another important step toward the political unity of Western Europe this week . President Kennedy can now go before the country , as he proposes to do Tuesday , with a bolder political and military program . He can even talk of raising taxes to pay for the new proposals . This does not mean that he is using the Berlin alarm in a deceptive way . It is true that most top officials here do not believe Khrushchev will risk a nuclear war for Berlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not risk the security of the nation on an optimistic hunch that Khrushchev is bluffing . Since 1896 , the world has scarcely known a year without wars , armed revolts , massacres or other and lesser forms of slaughter . Since then there have been two World Wars , the Spanish American War , the Boer War of 1899-1902 , the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 ; the two bloody Balkan wars of 1912-13 ; the Korean war ; and all the innumerable clashes and interventions in Finland , the Caucasus , the Ukraine , Poland , Hungary , Manchuria , Siberia , Spain , China , Algeria , Formosa , French Indo China , Laos , and even Cuba . No Panic Buttons This capital is not spoiling for a fight . More appropriations are coming up , so everybody is yelling for more than his share , but essentially the President is working on a political strategy at home and abroad , with some military components , rather than on a military strategy with political components . He has always believed that Eisenhower should have done this after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready for new exertions . He regarded Eisenhower 's failure to do so as a fundamental mistake and he does not propose to repeat it now . Meanwhile , he is prepared to negotiate with Khrushchev , and is even eager to carry his arguments for self-determination , disarmament and nuclear testing to the United Nations . Thus , within six months , the Soviet leaders have transformed Kennedy 's open-handed offers to talk and accommodate into a more serious test of will and strength . What started in January as a discussion of disarmament is now turning into a more serious arms race . This is clearly not what Khrushchev wanted , but once more , like Stalin , he is creating all the things he fears the most ; greater military power in Germany , a stronger America with more arms and less unemployment , a faster pace toward the unification of Western Europe . It is an odd record for a man who is supposed to be so clever . He is turning out to be Kennedy 's political whip on Capitol Hill , and before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education bill , though that is probably expecting too much .
