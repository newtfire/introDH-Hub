Come behind the scenes at Walt Disney World near Orlando , Fla. , where , at various locales , machines are mixing batter for those yummy Mickey-shaped waffles , a Minnie head is getting a last-minute application of eye liner and " mouse-care ? and Michael Eisner , the chairman and CEO of the whole company , is checking out a part of the park that will be hidden from public view until May 1 . " You know what would look great over there ? " says the surprisingly tall ( for those who 've seen him introduce the Disney Sunday-night TV show ) , still boyishly affable 47-year-old executive . As he speaks , he is pointing to a space on the back lot of the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park , a dazzling 135-acre high-tech playground that will combine rides , shows and exhibits ? all " themed , " as the Disney folks say , to the world of movies and TV ? with a tour of an actual film-production facility . ... an aircraft carrier ! " Eisner says . " You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior earned $40 million last year , largely because Eisner seems , like no entertainment executive since Walt Disney himself , to have located the pulse of the American public ? " you mean , next to the replica of a subway car ? " " Sure , why not ? " Eisner says . " Call some naval bases and see if you can get an aircraft carrier and put it right there . " " Sixty miles from the nearest ocean ? " " Yeah , it 'll be fun to look at , do n't you think ? " Others may deal in weightier matters than this always energetic , family-oriented fellow who worked his way up through the programming department at ABC Television , and then moved over to Paramount  | Pictures , where he was the driving force behind such smashes as " Terms of Endearment " and " Saturday Night Fever . " But no one in America has a neater job than Michael Eisner . Besides making the movies he wants for Walt Disney Studios and its somewhat more mature subdivision , Touchstone Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mickey Mouse watches and lord it over the company 's theme parks . These include Disneyland , the southern California original , and Disney World ? which may have started out to be the East Coast version of the above , but has become , over its 17-year history , something much more : a kind of warp zone of warmth and family values , similar to the Thanksgiving-dinner table , where people congregate to assure themselves that the world 's a fine place after all . Tropical sun : Americans patronize the 28,000-acre plot of central Florida bogland ( all but 5,000 acres of which remains in its **32;1223;TOOLONG natural state ) with a passion that can not be analyzed in terms of warm weather , Mickey Mouse-worship or humankind 's intrinsic need to play . Even flaming type-A personalities are content to stand on line there in the tropical sunshine , straps from the family Nikon and camcorder crisscrossing their chests like twin bandoleers , with one spouse and 2.3 children sucking on semihealthy juice pops in the shape of adorable Disney characters . The last slow day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it opened to the public and only 10,000 pioneering souls arrived . Now 25 million people pour through annually NEWSWEEK : APRIL 3 , 1989 49  | and leave behind close to $2 billion . Each year , in defiance of all logic , the lines get longer ? and the " satisfaction rate " of the customers ( as measured by exit polls ) gets higher than ever before . People love Disney World so much they voluntarily change their money into " Disney Dollars , " which are good only on the grounds and offer no advantages except the dubious thrill of owning expensive counterfeit currency . People even love the sight of the overwhelmingly white , middle-class multitudes in plaid shorts who clog Main Street USA , and spill out of the giant golf ball at Epcot called Spaceship Earth . It 's a good thing , too . For many more visitors are on the way , lured by the promise of mindboggling new things to see and do . Indeed , Disney World , which is already the world 's leading consumer of fireworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience the biggest boom in its history . Fun machines : Forget the mouse ears , Disney heads , and consider wearing a hard hat . At Eisner 's urging , more than $1 billion worth of fun machines , multimedia pavilions , fairy-tale hotels and ersatz volcanoes are rising rapidly at a park that was , for goodness ' sake , already impossible to explore fully in the course of one human-size vacation . By the time this spasm of construction subsides , in early 1990 , Disney World will have grown by 25 percent , and the standard three-day admission pass ( $78 for adults ; $63 for kids ) will have been replaced by a four-day version ? that still will leave folks feeling that they are n't seeing things as fast as Disney is throwing them up . Which is fine with Eisner . The sense that Disney World is overwhelming , too rich to consume , a lily gilded beyond all hope of appreciation ? this is the effect that he strives for . " Subtlety , " says Eisner , " is not one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's very high expectations . " Thus has it always been . When Walt himself purchased the land for Disney World in the early ' 60s ( for the more-thanreasonable price of about $200 an acre ) , he was frustrated by the lack of space at Disneyland , then already filled to overflowing . He envisioned a park that stretched out from Cinderella Castle toward the Orlando city limits and fairly bristled with fun stuff . It was the dream of a hardscrabble Midwestern farmboy . Now , under Eisner , a well-to-do lawyer 's son who grew up in New York City , it 's finally coming true . The first new silhouette on the Florida landscape this spring will be that of DisneyMGM Studios . Despite its name , this is not a partnership between rival moviemakers but the result of Disney 's obtaining rights from MGM so that , as Eisner says , " we can go beyond the Disney library and build attractions around other classics . " Elaborate scenes from MGM 's " Tarzan " and " The Wizard of Oz " as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park 's Great Movie Ride using a new generation of computerized " audio-animatronic " figures . When their cheek muscles twitch and their eyes blink , these A.A. figures ( to use the company vernacular ) look as lifelike as some of the real celebrities ( some of them A.A. figures in their own right ) who 'll be making films at the studio just next door . Tour wars : Disney is n't the first company to offer this kind of attraction . Universal Studios has operated a tour of its California production facility since 1964 ? and announced that it will open a similar enterprise , about three miles from Disney World , in 1990 . Eisner resents any implication , however , that Disney is n't the leader in this @#  | field . " Walt 's original idea , back in the ' 40s , was that Disneyland should be a tour of our studio , " he says . " Burbank did n't want the traffic coming in . But he never gave up on the idea , and neither did we . " Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCA , is hopping mad about the new park . Walt 's " little mouse , " he says , could become " one large , ravenous rat . " Eisner , in any case , has a lot more on his mind than just movies . About two months after the Disney-MGM Studios open with a prime-time NBC special on April30 , he 'll be cutting a ribbon for an attraction meant to entice Disney 's toughest audience : teenagers . Typhoon Lagoon will be an elaborate , epic novel of a water slide with eight different flumes , a snorkeling area and a surf-making machine capable of sending out waves of up to seven feet . For those who still have energy to burn after the mechanical tide ebbs , Disney will be opening Pleasure Island , a cluster of " themed " nightclubs for teens and adults . For those who , like most visitors , can barely drag themselves back to their rented Cutlass Cieras each evening , the property will include the elegant and handy ) Swan and Dolphin hotels , both the work of postmodernist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a striking representation of its namesake . The rush to see all the new stuff , and revisit old favorites such as the Magic Kingdom 's Haunted Mansion and Big Thunder Mountain , is already under way . Each day , several hundred headset-wearing " cast members " ( as Disney World 's 26,000 employees are called ) sit in long rows and take reservations for " on property " hotels , ranging from the ( also new ) Caribbean Beach , where rooms start at $69 , to the $205-a-night Grand Floridian . The vast majority of callers are repeat customers planning to travel a great distance , and their voices suggest a giddy anticipation of that morning when they pull into a space marked Goofy 23 or Minnie 4 and then wait ( ah , that first line , like that first scent of salt water on those seaside vacations of yore ) for the parking-lot tram . Some say it 's all for the kids , the roughly $500-per-person they 're spending to see Disney World in style for a week , the perhaps $800 more for hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 at what has become , as Niagara weeps , the world 's leading honeymoon destination . Big squid : Why ? Disney has taken a lush tropical wilderness , paved it over and added flying elephants ( Dumbo ; average waiting time 20 minutes ) and submarine-size squid ( " 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea " ; usually a 30-minute wait ) . The Thoreau in all of us is appalled . And the John Tower in us is n't doing much better . Booze and tobacco are hard to come by on the property , and night life is virtually nonexistent , at least until Pleasure Island is completed . " I 'd like to say that our show is entirely responsible for our success , " says Tom Elrod , Disney World 's senior vice president for marketing . But he ca n't ; it 's not that simple . Over the years research has shown that the formal " attractions " such as Space Mountain , Pirates of the Caribbean and Journey Into Imagination , beloved as they are for their lavish high-techness and ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in the hearts of the customers . What folks like even more , they say , is the friendliness of the employees and ? this is invariably the first thing cited ? the cleanliness with which Disney World constantly shines . For all the ostensible hubbub and swirl , the audio assault that accompanies Michael Jackson 's 3-D " Captain Eo " movie and the designed-in need to take a boat and a monorail to get from , say , Mickey 's Birthdayland to the Chinese restaurant at Epcot , Disney World is a zone of almost perfect efficiency and order . In a place of queues curling and winding and switchbacking into Tomorrowland , line jumping becomes the crime that dares not speak its name . Anything worse is not even imaginable . Line management : Egad , your high-school principal was right : courtesy is contagious . Not that the management believes it can sit back and let harmony happen . " There 's a real art to line management , " says Dick Nunis , head of Walt Disney Attractions . For example , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted by each attraction are generously overestimated , so that one comes away mysteriouslygra teful for having hung around 20 minutes for a 58-second twirl in the Alice in Wonderland teacups . ( " I used the same trick when I was trying to sell sitcoms to the networks , " says Eisner . " I showed them a 23-minute ' Happy Days ' pilot and told them it was a half hour . They thought it was the fastest-paced show they 'd ever seen . " ) The lines , moreover , are always moving , even if what looks like the end is actually the start of a second set of switchbacks leading to ? oh , nol ? a pre-ride waiting area . Those little tricks of the theme-park trade mean a lot . Even during the peak periods of Christmas and Easter weeks ? when the parking fields sometimes close at midmorning , causing Winnebagos to sadly turn away like bull elephants rejected by their mates ? there are few complaints . Nor is there much negative press coverage . This is partly due , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by providing free passes to almost any reporter , photographer or TV technician who phones or writes ahead and asks . For some special events , the freebies are laid on even more lavishly . To help publicize the opening of the Disney-MGM Studios , several thousand media memberare being offered free plane tickets an : hotel rooms . " Exploiting the Disney mystique , " it. - called . When an accident occurs on one c the rides or in a restaurant , or if someone gets mowed down by one of the clean-cui zealots constantly vacuuming up invisible litter on Main Street USA , Disney representatives have been known to rush to the scene with offers of free tickets and air fare home in exchange for an on-the-spot settlement . Only a few of the injured elect to file suits . And , according to a 1983 article in The American Lawyer , almost none o : those succeeds , owing to , among other things , " the company 's skill at gatherhw favorable witnesses at accident sites . . and the pro-Disney bias of Orlando jurors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney 's moviemaking division , provides the company 's official self-portrait . " Think of Disney World , " he says , " as a medium-size city with a crime rate of zero . " Just do not imagine that this all happened by accident . What we are seeing , in the ever-smiling faces of the snack-stand employees , and smelling , in the **36;1257;TOOLONG rest rooms , are the ripple effects of a disastrous visit Walt Disney made to some long-forgotten California amusement park in the early ' 50s . " Walt was so disgusted by the carelessness he and his children experienced there , " says theme-park chief Dick Nunis , " that he made this almost fanatical attention to detail a top priority when he opened Disneyland in 1955 . " Indeed , virtually no mosquitoes make it in from the surrounding swampland , thanks to continuous nocturnal spraying . Disney died in 1966 , two years before construction on his World started . He lives on , though , partly through Disney University , a training center where cast members take courses designed , says director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of helping other people have fun . " Employees , most of whom come from outside the area ( Disney , the largest nongovernment employer in Florida , exhausted the local manpower supply long ago ) , take three days of motivational courses at the start of their careers , and refresher courses later . At least once during his or her career , every Disney World management employee must spend a day prancing around the property in an 80- to 100-pound character costume . Because it looks on its employees as playing showbiz " roles , " Disney does n't hesitate to tell them that they are too over52 NEWSWEEK : APRIL 3 , 1989  | weight , too short , or in some other way not in sync with the theme of a particular attraction . ( Those who do n't make the grade because of physical characteristics are offered behind-the-scenes jobs . ) And a grooming code , even for those deep within the wool and wire of Pluto or Scrooge McDuck , is strictly enforced . Men can not sport facial hair ; women ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founder , Oberle admits , could not have worked at his own World . Nor would he recognize Epcot in its current state . After Walt died , his less bold and , increasingly , less prosperous successors revised the plans for his first proposed expansion beyond the Magic Kingdom . Instead of a utopian Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow with residential areas and schools , Epcot had evolved , by its opening in 1982 , into a World 's Fair-ish series of corporate-sponsored salutes to the Land , the Sea and Energy , bordered by an array of international eateries . It was , and is , good clean fun . But it was not Walt . The Disney-MGM Studios park most definitely is . The company 's legendary team of designers , the Imagineers , has created a main street that is a fanciful , palm-treelined homage to Hollywood Boulevard circa 1940 . Immediately beyond the entrance ? inspired by art deco architecture of the now condemned Los Angeles Civic Auditorium ? sits the mythical Sid Cahuenga 's tumbledown bungalow , where the eccentric owner supposedly scrapes by selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixing the almost real with the really phony ( " Watch out ! " says the Jungle Cruise guide , as he fires a starter 's pistol at an audio-animatronic hippo ) , but never with such abandon as here . When visitors to the new park wander past the Mickey 's of Hollywood clothing store and a re-creation of the Brown Derby restaurant , they 'll be pestered for their signatures by actors playing " autograph hounds " ? and urged to take screen tests ( available later on cassette for $24.95 ) by real live " producers . " Movie ride : The street ends in an opium dream of an opulent Chinese Theater . The artful blending of the actual and the artificial , however , continues . For inside the theater 's ornate lobby , the curious will find ... well , a line ? but one that inches toward The Great Movie Ride , a 42-minute meander through Hollywood history that should impress the most jaded amusement-park aficionados . Look , Mother , there 's an audio-animatronic Gene Kelly singin ' in the goll-darned rain ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this here " Alien " spaceship ! Omigod , Martha , the tram with the kids has disappeared ! And ours is being hijacked by some greasylooking extra from an old James Cagney flick ! But never fear . After a trip through Munchkinland and the Temple of Doom , the experience concludes happily enough , with the riders deposited , in keeping with sacred Disney tradition , directly in front of a food counter and souvenir shop . Visitors who make their way past those amenities , and into the staggering brightness of the Florida sunlight , will find themselves a few steps away from the start of the movie-studio tour . This two- to three-hour trip through a full-scale production facility is more a matter of fact than fantasy , and thus a somewhat unpredictable experience . All visitors will get to see sound stages , scenery shops and an animation building where Disney cartoonists will churn out shorts for theatrical release . Everyone also will visit Catastrophe Canyon , where large-scale special effects such as earthquakes and floods will be created , and cleaned up , every 3.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary folks to experience the thrill of being interviewed by Howard Cosell or doing a guest shot on " Cheers . " The content of the tour , though , will depend largely on what , if anything , is being shot there on any given day . Not that there 's been much downtime ; thanks to Florida 's status as a right-to-work state , Disney , along with several outside production companies , has rushed to take advantage of the lower labor costs and kept the place humming with films such as " Ernest Saves Christmas " and " The Mickey Mouse Club " TV series . Still , in showbiz , you never know what might cause a delay . Consider what happened recently , when Bette Midler was down at the Disney-MGM Studios shooting a film called " Stella . " The  | script called for a rubbish-strewn New York street . But before Midler could get out of her trailer to shoot the scene , the unstoppable Disney World sanitation crew had zoomed in and cleaned up the mess . When Michael Eisner told that story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , held at the Florida playground , it was greeted with giggles from an audience that was obviously enraptured with its huggable CEO . And no wonder . Earlier in his presentation , Eisner , in summarizing Disney 's growth in the four years since he and company president Frank Wells assumed leadership , had described one of the all-time great corporate comebacks . Before that duo came aboard ? at the urging of Walt 's nephew Roy Jr. ? Disney ranked far down on the list of Hollywood studios . It had barely escaped one takeover bid ? and eventually , it seemed , the Texasbased Bass Brothers ( who own 15 percent of the stock ) or some corporate raider would be dismantling Walt 's empire and selling off the pieces . ' Pixie dust ' : But , thanks to hits such as " Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? " , " Beaches " and " Oliver &; Company , " Disney led all the studios in box-office receipts in 1988 . The demand for video cassettes of " Cinderella " and " Lady and the Tramp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Pluto T shirts and Goofy night lights are zip-adee-doo-dahing off the shelves . During the four-year Eisner era , in fact , annual revenues have increased 150 percent , to $3.4 billion in 1988 , while profits have more than quintupled , to $522 million in 1988 . " My husband and I love Disney so much that we sprinkle pixie dust on each other before we leave for work in the morning , " one stockholder told a sheepish Eisner during the question-and-answer portion of the meeting . At the end , as the audience filed out , the PA system played " Do n't Worry , Be Happy " ? which , apart from its pertinent message , happens to be a Grammy-winning song on the best-selling soundtrack from yet another Disney-produced smash , " Cocktail . " So it 's no secret where the money is coming from for Disney World 's growth and expansion . But Eisner is n't just more successful than Walt ever was . He is , by consensus , more Walt than Walt . " He 's a genuine idea man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , one so unprima donna-ish that Eisner often roams the streets of Disney World at dawn , picking up the occasional gum wrapper and chatting with the cast members who work , as costume cleaners or cooks , in the labyrinth of tunnels below the Magic Kingdom . His " secret goal in life " is to someday phase out hamburgers at Disney World and replace them with healthier turkey burgers . About the only thing that upsets him visibly is hearing someone use the term " Mickey Mouse " to mean small-time or chintzy . He 's not too good to be true , he insists ? just your ordinary movie mogul of the ' 80s . " We 're not a bunch of drug-taking womanizers out here in Burbank , the site of Disney 's corporate headquarters , " Eisner says . " We 're basically hardworking family people . " The Disney top executives certainly fit that description . Eisner often takes his wife of 21 years , Jane , and their three sons , Breck , Eric and Anders , on business trips ? and constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Disney annual report , where he recently discussed company earnings in the span since " Breck started high school . " Eisner knows so much about amusement parks , he says , " because it 's basically the same business as making movies . An attraction in one of our parks is like a film , in that it has to have a theme and tell a story . And I know a good story always has a beginning , middle and end . " At Disney World , the plot seems to have barely begun to unfold . At times it 's difficult to fathom its direction . " Occasionally I take my kids on canoe trips , down in the south end of the property , where there are still alligators around every turn , " says Eisner . " And I say , Let 's figure out a way to get people down here so they can see things in this natural state ' . " Meanwhile , things could n't be more civilized on a 433-acre plot , where Disney is building the two Michael Graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream ? Since the park is , basically , a reflection of our desires , perhaps we should all watch carefully as it continues to take shape . Is it headed toward turkey burgers and unspoiled scenery ? or fast food and the fake thrills of Catastrophe Canyon ? Secret designs : Because this is Disney World , though , the only response can be : keep your arms and legs inside the car and refrain from flash photography . That , in any case , was what Eisner was doing . more or less , one recent morning , deep within a southern California warehouse where Disney tests the top-secret designs for its theme-park rides . The sense of an impending deadline was just as palpable there as it was during his tour of the Disney-MGM Studios a few days earlier . But the problem now was the Wonders of Life Pavilion , yet another multimilliondollar addition to the Florida park , this one scheduled to open at Epcot this fall . What 's wrong ? Nothing , really , other than that this exhibit will feature a film that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child all the way into the delivery room ? where tourists bedecked in duck-billed gim me caps and mouse-motif leisure wear will witness the actual birth of a baby . It is a " super idea , " says Eisner . Still , certain representatives of Metropolitan Life Insurance , the company spending several million dollars to sponsor the attraction , need further convincing . What if the woman selected for their film requires an episiotomy ? Suppose it 's a breech birth ? We 've come a long way from the tilt-a-whirl , baby . But smack dab in a " destination resort " chock-full of clockwork crocodiles and cement palm trees , wo n't the real drama of labor contractions be a tad jarring ? Eisner assures them no ? that with the average American 's quest for truth , and discreet camera angles , all things are possible . Then , in case they 're still doubting , he bestows the theme-park magnate 's ultimate compliment . When sex finally rears its head at Disney World , he says , his voice dropping to a triumphant whisper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
