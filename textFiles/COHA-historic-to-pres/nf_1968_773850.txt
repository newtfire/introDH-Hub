 space is often left open though sometimes filled in with chicken netting to reduce wind velocity and encroachment of rain or snow . Pitched roofs are ideal , and a pitch of 18 ? 20 ? is optimal . On no account should the ridge be closed ; a 6 in. gap running the full length of the building is preferable . Slatted floors will find favour more in the west where straw is expensive or unavailable . Slats are usually made in panels of 8 x 4 ft. and are supported on joists about 24 ? 36 in. above the ground . The slat dimension is critical 1* in. wide , II in. deep ands in. gap between each . Too wide a slat and too narrow a gap lead to fouling of the pens . Slats are best fitted horizontal to the feed troughs . Sheep pens are usually arranged on either side of the feed passage . Troughs are increasingly catered for by a copy of the Norwegian hay box ' 2 ft. 2 in. wide , 111 in. high with rails above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is placed in the box , on top of which is a ladder ' or weldmesh 3 x 3 in. strip , through which the sheep feeds but avoids wastage . Such a box into which concentrates can also be fed has the virtue of also forming the pen front . Water must be in continuous supply , but water bowls are not favoured due to expense and therefore are rarely present in sufficient numbers and easily fouled . A water tank(s) is preferred , or alternatively a continuous half-glazed pipe running the full length of the building , from a header tank which flows continuously . Even temporary restriction of water can be dangerous ? in ewes as well as fattening lambs . Management Factors . Adequate artificial lighting must be provided for lambing , and in an enclosed house care should be taken to avoid frightening ewes when the lights are turned on . Sheep , like other animals , can become accustomed to new environments such as confined buildings , but undue excitement and disturbance , particularly by strangers , should be avoided . There is no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle better than others , but no breed is unadaptable as far as is known . At lambing time individual penning arrangements are necessary either within the ewe pens or elsewhere . After lambing has taken place segregate the ewe and her litter for at least 24 hours . She can then be joined with another ewe and lambs and after 72 hours reunited with the lambed flock . Failure to do this may result in trodden lambs , mismothering and even hysteria in ewes . Soon after lambing , a creep should be provided where lambs may have access to a special feed and water ad libitum . Easy entry and exit from the creep is necessary with two distinct sets of openings . If competition occurs , uneven growth of lambs will result . There should be no problem with the lambs ' feet if the slats dimensions described earlier are used . Artificial Rearing , Early Weaning and Intensive Fattening of Lambs . This subject is considered briefly under four headings : // Orphan lamb rearing . Early weaning of lambs at or near birth from large litters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Intensive fattening of early weaned lambs and of store lambs . Orphan Lamb Rearing . Bottle feeding of orphan lambs has been practised with mixed success for generations when an emergency occurs . It is invariably a labour of love and the economies of the exercise are rarely questioned . Such lambs have quite often never suckled a ewe and in the absence of colostrum their chances of survival are limited . Various home concoctions , nearly all based on cow 's milk ( a poor substitute for that of a ewe ) have been used : During the past three years properly designed milk replacers have been developed , which when reconstituted with water , closely approxi mate ewes ' milk . The milk powder is usually mixed with water at 11 ? 2+ lb. per gallon . Techniques in feeding these milks ' differ from centre to centre and from farm to farm . Hurley , for example , choose to feed the liquid cold ad libitum , and in this way minimise souring of milk and also labour input . Furthermore lambs suck the milk through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pen . Several lambs draw from one bucket . At Cambridge , on the other hand , the liquid is fed warm in set feeds ? four times daily for the first 10 days , thereafter twice daily ? and in bowls such that the liquid is drunk and not sucked . ( Queen and Davies 1966 ) . A lamb creep ration is offered ad libitum after 1 week and the lambs are weaned off the liquid at 25 lb. liveweight , i.e. at about 4 to 5 weeks of age . Good hay and water should be avail-able from 1 week of age . Both systems work well but management and close observation in the early stages clearly have a major influence on success . Using this feeding system large litters of lambs are now a manageable proposition , since any in excess of two per ewe may be artificially reared . Such a development opens new horizons in breeding for pro lificacy , linked with a feeding programme at time of mating and through pregnancy to cater for large litters . Furthermore frequency of lambing can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ewes having to suckle lambs to 12 ? 16 weeks of age . It is interest ing to note that the total litter weight of , say , three lambs at 6 weeks of age will be considerably greater if one or two lambs are artificially reared , rather than the entire litter left on the ewe . Lambs grow well and at Hurley a lb. liveweight gain per day has been experienced and like all young animals lambs convert food efficiently . Up to 5 weeks of age the conversion ratio will be less than 2:1 , and thereafter to 12 weeks about // 3 or 4:1 . Food cost to 5 weeks will be 25 ? 30s. , the cost mainly relating to the milk substitute . Early Weaning . Not all farmers consider the risks from disease and good management necessary with liquid feeding justifiable , and therefore prefer to plan their future sheep development on a system of later weaning at 4 ? 6 weeks of age at a time when liquid feeding is no longer necessary . In this context large litters of lambs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two functional teats , three lambs is probably the maximum they will care for and nourish , even to 5 weeks of age . But increasing the frequency of lambing is still a feasible proposition . Surprisingly lambs can be weaned from the ewe at that age with no ill effect on the udder . Investigations have been made to even reduce the load ' on the ewe at that stage by removing a triplet and/or a twin again with no ill effect . The removal of a twin is of course a possible development under hill conditions where in many flocks management and feeding is not geared to the production of twins because they are considered worthless . For lambs to be weaned at 5 weeks , they need to have been accustomed to creep feeding beforehand . After weaning they may be housed , and continue on a mainly all-concentrate diet ; or be at grass with or without concentrate supplementation . In the latter case grassland management must be of the highest order to ensure a constant supply of young fresh grass and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be necessary . One further application of early weaning concerns aged ewes which if culled at the traditional time in the late summer usually make little return . If , however , they are early weaned they may be sold fat on a more favourable market , thus , offsetting ( if this is necessary ) the additional feed cost to the lambs . Intensive Fattening Programmes . Intensive fattening of lambs is a natural follow-on to artificial rearing or early weaning . Since liveweight gains are of paramount importance the diet will be largely grain with a protein , mineral and vitamin supplement . Such a mixture will have a crude protein of 11 ? 12 per cent and an S.E. of 65 ? 70 . Barley is the usual cereal ; oats tend to be fibrous and should not exceed 20 per cent ; sugar beet pulp increases palatability , but if in excess of 15 per cent may cause looseness ; maize is satisfactory but often too expensive . The ration should not be dusty and thus not ground or rolled too fine . Hay and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will put on 3 ? 4 lb. per week and will convert the food at 4 to 5:1 ratio with acceptable carcasses . Although it never became general practice , work by Burgess and Lamming demonstrated that stilboestrol implants in such lambs gave 33 per cent increase in liveweight gain , though some diminution in carcass quality was noted . More recent work by Lodge ( 1966 ) at Sutton Bonington concerned complete diets which included ground // straw in partial replacement of maize . It was apparent that 10 ? 20 per cent of straw was satisfactory but such feeding is still not a general practical proposition . It is necessary to draw a comparison between intensive fattening methods and that of buying in store lambs , particularly lambs of hill breeds which are available September to November and are usually very cheap . They do not , unfortunately , grow quickly and 1 ? 2 lb. per week is their expected performance regardless of size and quality . On grain rations they convert food badly at least 6 : I. Nevertheless there is often a profit in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say not more than Is. 2d. per lb. liveweight . They should be carried through on a grain feeding system , at a maximum daily intake of 21 lb. , until the market price rises in December to March . It is the market prices at purchase and sale times which govern the economics of such a venture . Breeds and Breeding There are some forty recognised breeds and crosses in Great Britain . Each tends to be confined to a particular locality and one wonders whether such a wide range of genetical material is necessary . Breeds and crosses and sires of fat Iamb tend to have their fashionable periods , but the justification for such trends is difficult to see . Records are very slowly becoming available , and it is clear that the variation within breeds or recognised crosses are as great as those between them . The likelihood is that the majority of sheep have yet to be extended to their full genetic potential . Increasing intensification is beginning to identify the strengths and weaknesses of sheep and this has led to the development of new breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has resulted from the most extensive use of progeny and performance testing , fully backed by the skilled application of genetic techniques and computer calculations . The Cadzow Ltd . Improver ' is another example , and more recently the Cobb Breeding Co. of broiler fame is becoming established in this new field . These breeding developments have taken full advantage of the Finnish Landrace for prolificacy , the Westphalia for milk production and the Romanov for growth rate and carcass quality . The successful application of these ventures has yet to be proved , but as with the Charolais in the cattle world , they are undoubtedly acting as a spur to all sheep breeders and associated organisations . In addition to work at the Animal Breeding Research Organisation , Edinburgh , there have been advances in out-of-season lambing and in the synchronisation of oestrus . This avenue will be particularly beneficial to the flock-master , since litter size has probably still some way to go . Furthermore , work by Rowson ( 1966 ) at Cambridge indicates that foetal mortality may well be considerably greater than realised and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may shortly be much better understood . Ewes , and also rams , vary in the period of sexual activity according to breed . Lowland ewes will commence in August through to October whereas hill ewes are active during October-December . Nevertheless in both cases activity coincides with declining daylight . Williams ( 1965 ) has carried out researches into this subject ( See chapter 7 ) . This treatment conducted in February-March resulted in ewes coming on heat 6 weeks earlier than usual . There are obvious management difficulties with darkened houses for ewes , but simplification of the technique is being pursued . Such a system could allow one additional lambing in 2 years , i.e. three and not two . One of the problems of shepherding is the spread of lambing over at least one cycle of 16-17 days . Concentration of lambing has many advantages , not the least of which is an even bunch of lambs . This objective has for some time been partly achieved by the use of vasectomised rams which were able to stimulate ewes to ovulate during the first heat when fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of hormones ? Progesterone and P.M.S. These have been used experimentally by injection , but such a system has as yet no farm application . G. D. Searle &; Co . Ltd. ( 1966 ) introduced a vaginal sponge impregnated with progesterone . If the sponge is removed from the ewe after 12-17 days , she will come on heat within 48-72 hours ( Wishart 1966 ) . Invariably the first heat is not very fertile and it is often recommended that the rams are withheld until the second heat 17 days later . If , in addition to synchronisation , an attempt is made to gain a few weeks out of season , P.M.S. may have to be used by injection . The technique is only in its infancy but if successful would make a valuable and worthwhile contribution to the planning of more intensive shepherding . Hill Sheep Farming Hill farming by virtue of its land , climate and altitude is a most inflexible farming system . Cattle and sheep are its only products discounting , of course , forestry . Indeed there are some who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But hill farming land constitutes one-third of the agricultural land ; half the sheep population is carried on it and the other two-thirds depend on it for store lambs and cattle . There are many social problems and partly because of this fact government subsidies are provided without which hill farming would founder . Yet profitability is at a very low ebb and capital is desperately needed . The system is fraught with traditional practices and beliefs , and unless some of these are set on one side the future is even more difficult to project . Perhaps the major problem is monetary output on each farm . // Although the litter size of ewes may reach 100 per cent , in many flocks it is nearer 50 per cent . Weather has such a major influence . Mortality is high ? 20 ? 25 per cent of lambs born . This low output of numbers must therefore be corrected and in time , it is hoped , better quality will also command a better price per lamb . Nutrition is the principal controlling factor in output per ewe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater numbers of ewes will in themselves result in better pastures , or will encourage greater use of fencing , fertilisers and land regeneration . They will also help to reduce labour costs per ewe , and at the same time provide remuneration and facilities to lessen the sociological problems of the hills . Housing of hill sheep in winter may well play a part for the prime purpose of increasing stocking density in the summer when herbage is plentiful . Winter housing would lessen the effect of climate on the ewes and careful feeding with more interdependence with lowland farms for supplies could overcome the hungry gap ' of winter . An interesting experiment at the East of Scotland College farm is investigating just this philosophy and already on one section of the hill , the stocking rate has been increased by 50 per cent without any loss of individual performance ( Cunningham 1964 ? 65 ) . It is in fact climate and nutrition which are the stumbling blocks in hill sheep farming . Ewes culled from the hill to low ground conditions quickly show that their potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent more lambs and 1 ? 2 lb. more wool are immediate rewards under such conditions . However hill farms have a value which must not be lost sight of , in attempts to intensify for profit motives . Artificialdom without some of the proven practices will surely falter . It is a case of blending the strengths of all new developments with the natural facilities of the hill environment . SUMMARY In 1967 the British Sheep Industry is in the dilemma of change . The emergence of farm management techniques through which financial data is becoming more readily available , have revealed the weakness of traditional sheep husbandry ? extensive , low output and high costs . Furthermore sheep compare unfavorably with other livestock and cash crops , in contributing to total farm income . The marketing of sheep products is confused to say the least and yet the future market gives cause for confidence . The complexity of breeds , the paucity of factual data and the intrusion of foreign breeds are warnings of the susceptibility of the whole business . Reorganisation on a planned basis is so vitally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development background , new ideas are appearing . There is an awareness of the untapped potential of sheep and their unexpected adaptability to new techniques . Far from being merely a scavenger or at best a side-line , // sheep can respond and be as relatively productive as a high-yielding dairy cow . Much of the intensification and increased output of sheep will come from continually increasing knowledge of their behaviour , nutrition and physiology . Greater and better food input for larger and more viable litters , followed by the new realisation that milk secretion must be constantly encouraged if lambs are to grow at their maximum live-weight gain . Physiological development will enable greater output per ewe in her lifetime , through perhaps earlier lambing , out-of-season lambing and synchronised lambing . But whatever technique or combination of systems is applied there will be the need to be conscious of increasing risk and therefore greater awareness of nutritional deficiencies , disease barriers and preventive medicine if the roundabouts are not to catch up with the swings . Chapter 7 THE ONSET AND THE MODIFICATION OF THE BREEDING SEASON OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low gross margin per acre achieved from the more conventional sheep management systems has not compared favourably with other forms of livestock production . Since there is no particular reason for keeping sheep under lowland conditions the cri terion of their suitability , as an alternative to other enterprises , should be based largely on productivity . Animal production is a complex operation and intensification may be achieved in a variety of ways involving one or more of the three major factors of production land , labour and capital . In so far as the animal itself is concerned , intensi fication is interpreted as the adoption of a method or methods of production , which not only make heavier demands on one or more of the basic processes , namely reproduction , lactation , growth and deve lopment , but may also involve more control over the environment thus creating new ecological situations . In most of the more intensive methods of production the choice of livestock is unrelated to their ability to survive and to produce under local conditions , which may well be severe , but is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency and a high level of performance . It is well recognised that a very important aspect of the production potential of sheep is their reproductive potential . It is their reproductive potential that delineates the future role of sheep in some intensive systems of production . Two important basic components of reproductive potential are lambing interval and ovulation rate . The first is to a great extent governed by the breeding season and the second closely associated with the breed , age and condition of the ewe and also the stage of the breeding season . The level of ovulatory activity sets the upper limit to the level of fertility attainable in any flock ( Averill 1965 ) . The Breeding Season ' The restricted breeding season of most breeds of sheep kept in the higher latitudes is well recognised ( Asdell 1946 ; Hafez 1952 ) . The 87 // establishment of a clearly defined breeding season is generally attributed to natural selection having taken place in an environment with distinct annual fluctuations . The correct timing of the season of birth resulted from a capacity to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year variation . Response to such fluctuations resulted in a fairly clear division of the calendar year into an anoestrous season and a breeding season . Although this rhythmic activity has long been known the study of the relative importance of the various factors contributing to its maintenance has largely taken place during the last 30 years . The effects of the ecological factors on fertility have been reviewed by Hafez ( 1965 ) ; in this discussion particular attention is given to the onset of the breeding season of the breeds and crosses of sheep found in Great Britain and to methods of modifying the seasonal pattern of breeding activity . The Onset of the Breeding Season In spite of the fact that the onset of the breeding season has such a profound influence on the flexibility with which flock-masters can time the lambing season there is only limited published information on the onset of the breeding season ( Hafez 1952 , Lees 1966 , Williams 1966 ) . This information is important in relation to the choice of method of advancing or synchronising the onset of activity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent study ( Williams 1966 ) serves to illustrate some of the more important features connected with the onset of the season . The histograms represent the distribution of the first oestrus in groups of ewes , of three breeds , which had been given every opportunity from late spring of exhibiting oestrus . The mean date of onset given as day of year , for each year shows only slight variation between years . This is in agreement with the findings of Averill ( 1965 ) who found that the mean date of onset of ovulatory activity in Romney ewes in New Zealand was closely related to a calendar date . // The investigation of the effect of nutrition on the early stages of the breeding season in adult ewes has been directed at the improvement of fertility . There is no evidence to suggest that flushing can have a marked effect on the onset of the season ( Coop 1966 ) . Ewes transferred from high to low altitudes and showing a 10 per cent increase in bodyweight between two successive autumns did not show an appreciable advancement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Variability due to age applies more to the ewe lamb than to other age groups . In the case of ewe lambs the development of sexual activity is primarily a function of age but there seems to be a threshold of liveweight below which lambs do not exhibit oestrus ( Hammond Mr. 1944 , Hafez 1952 , Allen and Lamming 1961 ) . The interval from the spring lambing is unlikely to affect the onset of the breeding season . Techniques such as artificial rearing and early weaning of lambs may nevertheless have an important role in systems based on short lambing intervals . The date of the onset of the breeding season is of considerable importance in relation to post-lambing breeding activity . Lees ( 1964 ) has reported that , in a group of Clun ewes lambing up to December , conceptions took place about 6 weeks after lambing . In many breeds and types , pregnancy is as long or longer than the breeding season . It follows that the unfavourable seasonal changes in the photoperiod , which occur at the end of December , coincide with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate the suppressive effect of the light environment from any delaying effect parturition , lactation and presence of the lamb might have . Where seasonal effects are eliminated the role of all the factors contributing to the umbrella ' term lactation anoestrum , are of considerable importance and require greater definition . There is some evidence to suggest that the suppressive effect of lactation per se has been overestimated ( Mauleon and Dauzier 1965 ) . In general terms it seems unnecessary to separate lambs from the ewes prior to the fifth week and can not be recommended as a practice simply to ensure uniform return to breeding activity . Although it is generally acknowledged that rams are not as seasonal in their sexual behaviour as ewes , seasonal variations and breed differences have been reported ( Hewlet 1966 , Thibault et al . 1966 ) . An adequate safeguard against a period of sexual rest in the ram is usually achieved by using more than one breed and by using a much higher percentage of rams relative to ewes compared with the accepted ratio for autumn tupping flocks . Marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the onset of the breeding season . This can be seen clearly in Fig. 6 ( a ) ; the breeds shown represent types which feature in the stratified pattern of production found in our sheep industry . The Down type has a mean date early in August , the crossbred in mid-September and the mountain breed in the last week of October . Although there is little overlap // between the breeds illustrated , a more important aspect is the distribution of the onset within a group . It is this distribution that presents the problem of organising matings on a flock basis early in the season . It also suggests that members of a flock are not at the same hormonal status during the approach of the breeding season . The attainment of earlier lambing can , to some extent , be achieved by choice of breed , but is of limited commercial significance . A very high percentage of our breeding ewes are crossbred and as long as the present stratified system of sheep production remains , the restrictive influence of the seasonality of breeding will continue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of initiating activity out of season will have to be relied on to achieve greater flexibility in the timing of lambing and of attaining short lambing intervals consistently . The modification of the breeding season The ecological factors involved in the maintenance of periodicity fall into two main groups , those which are a part of the physical environment and those which are described as being a part of the social environment . In the former , the photoperiod and fluctuations in temperature and humidity are important ; in the latter unaccustomed presence of the males and transportation have been shown to affect sexual activity . The climatic fluctuations experienced in Great Britain are such as to make them relatively unimportant . The importance of the social factors have not been adequately assessed . It is well established that they are of considerable importance during the transition from anoestrum to the cyclic phase ; it is sometimes overlooked in the assessment of treatments applied during the approach of the breeding season . These factors , however , can only be considered where relatively slight advancement is required . The limitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Zealand ( Edgar and Bilkey 1963 ) . Marshall ( 1936 , 1937 , 1942 ) placed the role of exteroceptive factors in the maintenance of reproductive periodicity on a firm foundation . Marshall assembled a wide range of evidence in these notable contributions to emphasise the dependence of the breeding season on environmental factors . He described the response to seasonal change as an outstanding fact ' and that light must be regarded as the principal stimulus ' . In so far as the modification of the breeding season is concerned , it is generally acknowledged that cyclic activity can only be achieved by the application of treatments simulating the exteroceptive stimuli and principally by the manipulation of the photic environment . Marshall presented data on the breeding behaviour of ewes subjected to transequatorial transfer ( which is essentially subjection to a contrasting light regime ) to support the concept that photostimulation results in the activation of the higher centres regulating reproductive // phenomena . Since most of the evidence is of a presumptive nature , investigations involving photostimulation have been of an empirical nature but , nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a stimulus and also permit an assessment to be made of their role in systems of intensive production ( Yeats 1949 , Hart 1950 , Hafez 1952 , Mauleon and Rougeot 1962 , Thwaites 1965 , Williams 1966 , Wodzicka-Tomaskewska et al . 1967 ) . The more important information on the response of ewes , whose reproductive seasons are known to be under photoperiodic domination , may be summarised as follows : Gradual increases and decreases which simulate natural changes , are effective but not essential . A similar response can be achieved by using abrupt changes in the ratio of light to darkness . In the case of the former , the rate of change should exceed 15 minutes per week with a maximum of 18 hours of daylight at the point of change over . Where abrupt changes are applied the contrast between levels should be approximately 6 hours , with the lower level not exceeding 10 ? 12 hours of light per day . The period of decrease or low level ' required is governed by the reaction interval of the breed concerned . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is the same for light treatments as it is under natural conditions ( measured from 21st June ) . Breed differences exist under natural conditions and remain so for light treatments . The mean reaction intervals of most breeds originating in the higher latitudes fall in the range 60 ? 120 days . The fairly lengthy period of treatment limits the number of sequences which can be applied in a given period of time . Although it has been shown that a bi-annual rhythm based on sequences of 90 days results in two distinct breeding seasons in cyclic ewes , the duration of pregnancy , coupled with an allowance of 6 weeks between lambing and resumption of breeding activity , would curtail the number of sequences and also govern the period of favourable light phase . It is suggested that treatment should end by the sixth week after lambing . In designing effective light treatments , it should be borne in mind that ewes treated on accentuated reversed seasonal light show almost complete reversal in their breeding season . Prolonged exposure to a particular level of light per day will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ewes maintained at 6 , 9 , 12 , 13 and 24 hours of light per day , the pattern of seasonal activity became aberrant . Poor fertility , low intensity and irregular pattern of breeding have been reported in British breeds transferred to the equatorial regions . This has been attributed to the lack of photoperiodic stimulation . Adaptation to improved light rhythms is also influenced by the fact that adjustment to a new light regime is only gradual and may in some circumstances be affected by a refractory period . Since the application of light treatments usually involve a windowless house their contribution to commercial systems must await the results of investigations , // now in progress using supplementary light only . These treatments are applied during the winter period when there are other reasons for con-fining ewes . There is little information on the effect on the ewe of successive lambing intervals of less than 200 days and on the capacity of the breeding ewe to respond to a recurring rhythm based on sequences considerably less than the normal 180 day pattern . A full assessment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the study of reproductive efficiency together with the economic implications of concomitant changes in flock management . The use of hormones in the control of breeding activity is perhaps more widely known . Such treatments are designed to correct the quantitative and/or qualitative insufficiencies which exist during an oestrum . A variety of progestagens and/or gonadotrophic substances have been used to sensitise the tract and other centres and to stimulate the ovaries . The subject of hormonal control of reproductive pheno mena has been exhaustively reviewed in two recent symposia in Nebraska and in Oregon , U.S.A. The responses recorded during intensive investigation of hormone treatments under field conditions have varied both in terms of percentage exhibiting oestrus and also effective con ceptions , according to the method of treatment , the materials used , the state of the ewe and stage of anoestrurn . Observers have found that dry ewes are more responsive than lactating ewes and that treatment is usually more effective when administered near to the onset of the breed ing season . It appears that such treatments do not activate the centre controlling the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycles is initiated only when applied during the approach of the breeding season . The work of Gordon ( 1963 ) , Crowley ( 1964 ) and Cullen and Shearer ( 1964 ) should be consulted on field studies , and of Robinson ( 1965 ) and Roberts and Edgar ( 1966 ) on the more recent types of progestagens and method of administration . Chapter 8 A DEVELOPMENT IN MODERN SHEEP BREEDING E.T . CANTLE Not since the Agricultural Revolution ' in the time of Jethro Tull , Coke of Norfolk and the ' father ' of the Leicester ' Robert Bakewell ( 1725 ? 95 ) have there been real changes in the pattern of sheep production . The balance between grass , mixed and arable flocks has swung with the economics of cereal production , but no fundamental study of genetics , management and nutrition has taken place . There has , however , been steady progress in the veterinary field , and of course the use of fertilisers has done much to increase the productivity of extensive sheep farming . In the last decade two new approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which Cobb is one . Whilst each appear to be making a different approach to the subject there are two factors they have in common . Firstly they are interested in productivity and secondly each , in various degrees , in applying scientific knowledge , not only of genetics but of other disciplines . Both poultry breeders concerned have interests and experience in other forms of animal breeding and especially chicken breeding . It is common knowledge how the standard bred chicken and its commercial first cross have been replaced by the hybrids in egg production birds , and the application of population genetics in the meat production birds . Let us look closely at the approach being taken by the Cobb Breeding Company . Whilst it is not possible to publish details of their programme , if the philosophy behind the programme is analysed it will give some idea of the possible changes that the scientists from this Company hope to bring about . As early as 1960 work was in progress on a pure bred flock of Dorset Horn sheep . This breed has a prolonged breeding season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb crops in two years . This flock was being selected for its consistent twinning factor and long breeding season . Two facts emerged from this early work firstly the tremendous variation of breed type within a breed and the consequent necessity to select on an individual rather than flock basis , even though the flock is a closed one . Secondly , that environment asserted such an influence on the animal that it became impossible 94 // under outdoor conditions to make a factual evaluation of the sheep and their progress . Even when large numbers are used the same problem exists , because although the geneticist has a large statistical sample , the fact that these animals , of necessity , are spread over several farms means that the environmental influence is increased . These relate to different grass , different management and even different disease spectrums . Thus the larger sampling factor is negated by the increase of unknown factors . Therefore it was decided that the only way to carry out a scientific research programme on these sheep was to house them intensively all the year round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now housed under strictly controlled conditions . Management , nutrition , lighting programmes , ventilation are equal for each set of animals , thus enabling data to be accurately assessed . The programme , however , had to be enlarged to undertake studies on management factors under intensive conditions . Other breeds and individual animals have been added to the programme , notably a large import of Finnish Landrace sheep ; again these sheep were selected animals within the breed . One of the breed characteristics is the ability to produce large litters of Iambs , up to nine lambs have been recorded and five lambs are common ; however many Finnish Landrace only produce single lambs or twins . // It is obvious from the breeds being selected that fecundity is high on the list of improvements aimed for . Equally it must be remembered that fecundity is a trait with a low heritability , therefore it is necessary to have the highest possible reproducing factor in the basic stock . Cobb workers have produced a drawing-board version of the type of sheep it is desirable to produce ? embodying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less than two lambs consistently , and preferably four . 2 . Ability to breed all the year round at least under intensive conditions . 3 . The progeny to have fast meat growth , with good feed conversion and conformation. 4 . The progeny to have a good meat to bone ratio , and to carry little fat . It is certainly feasible that such a breed , or synthetic crossbreed , can be produced . However , not all these factors are going to be evolved in a short time . It is most likely that a process of evolution will take place , with increased reproduction taking priority . The second stage will be to increase the growth rate , and thirdly the redistribution of fat over the carcass . Phase one is now well advanced and it is possible to breed ewes that produce two litters of lambs ( utilising controlled environment and lighting patterns ) . Together with artificial rearing of lambs it is possible to produce two crops per annum . However , what is possible under a research programme may not be economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be that three crops every 2 years under semi-extensive conditions are more profitable than four crops under intensive conditions . The need to know the answers to such questions is important , and the use of an economist to evaluate these factors is essential . Phase two is involved to some extent with phase one , because the basic genotype for growth rate must be built into the breeding stock . However improvements in growth rate will continue for some time to come , so too will carcass conformation . Phase three is considered by many experts to be the most ambitious , this is to develop the meat and reduce the fat distribution over the carcass . Perhaps we are enthusiastic about this third phase because of the successful work which has been carried out on chicken relating to evisceration yield and meat-to-bone ratios . However , new techniques are being developed to analyse the body composition of live animals , and by making use of these tools it should be possible to influence a breeding programme . One method of evaluating the meat content of a live animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioactive isotope potassium-40 . It is also possible to estimate the meat to fat ratio by further variations on this principle . // Nutrition will play a large part in the success of these highly developed new breed types , therefore research into the animals ' basic requirements has to be carried on at the same time as the genetic programmes . Interest at the moment is on the complete cubed diet , which obviates the need for feeding hay and other roughage which is often wasteful . By feeding a completely cubed diet it is more certain that the animal receives its correct nutrition , especially the pregnant ewe . The ewe producing a litter will have to be fed according to the number of foetuses she is carrying . This information can be obtained by analysing a small sample of blood from each ewe . It will be obvious to the reader that many new techniques are being studied ? some will without question be utilised , but others will not be necessary for commercial sheep farmers . Whilst these research workers have deviated a long way from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two successive Sundays from the same field ' , they are still very concerned with details of management . When these new types of sheep are sold then the management advice will be sold with them . Because it is visualised that eventually the farmer will require a package deal involving both ewes and rams ( which will produce the market lamb but will not reproduce breeding stock ) , a close liaison will develop between the basic breeder , the flock multiplier and the farmer customer on all aspects of management . Perhaps two of the findings from the work so far carried out will be of most interest to the conventional shepherd . First , that even under a research programme the workers have to admit that the problems of interference from varying management problems under outdoor conditions confuse a breeding programme . How many farm projects have had cyclic breeding results  --  one year showing an improvement and the next year just the reverse . The second factor is that strains within breeds are more important than the breeds themselves . An argument has been carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sheep . It is just possible that the Cobb ' ewe may be useful under many differing types of management , and both scientific and market research will be directed to this end . The conservative farmer may be dismayed by these changes of breeds , systems and techniques which will certainly help to change a farming system which is more a way of life rather than that of a profitable business . However , if our work is successful , the many farmers that take advantage of modern farming methods will find new outlets for meat production becoming available . Once lambs can be produced on a regular quota system all the year round , then the Supermarket and chain store outlets for meat will become interested . It should be possible to market lamb via processing stations in a similar way to pig meat . One thing for sure is these workers envisage a new-look sheep // industry and a system will be offered , rather than just an improved breed . Time and effort is being put into management research , which would make even the conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of continuous lamb production ( attracting new market outlets ) , could change the sheep unit on a farm into a highly profitable enterprise . PIGS Chapter 9 THE HUSBANDRY OF PIGS HOUSED INTENSIVELY IAN MILLER Economic Factors Pig production in the future is bound to see an increase in large-scale fattening units , particularly in the cereal-growing areas of the eastern counties of the British Isles . Considerable capital investment in housing , mechanical handling of food and manure and complicated milling and mixing machinery will all be required . Automation will relieve the stockman of the drudgery and tedium of routine chores . The stockman himself will be a well-paid , qualified man who will be able to devote much of his time to management in the true sense of the word . The rations used will be based on a protein concentrate fortified with the necessary vitamins and minerals . With an increasing world demand for animal proteins concentrate manufacturers are , and will be , devoting considerable research facilities to the economic use of new forms of protein both natural and synthetic . The rations fed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most three , home-produced cereals . Costings and forward budgeting will be on a very accurate basis , with the majority of the external requirements being bought on a contract basis . Possibly the most important item to be bought will be the pigs to be fattened . The unit manager will require to insist upon weaners of good health and capable of high performance . Weaner Groups Weaners will largely come from the west of the country where , in relatively small units , pigs will be produced by breeding specialists whose greatest asset lies in traditional inbred stock sense . Their output will be sold on an agreed price per lb. basis , with possible additional financial incentives to improve his weaners ' economic potential . In order to achieve the smooth movement of quality pigs , the pig weaner group will have an important role to play . For a group to achieve the necessary high standard of weaner required there must be strict control and guidance from the organising body . To remain viable in the future a group must embark on a stock improvement plan which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a step ahead of its competitors . Breeders will be required to submit litters or individual pigs for both progeny and performance tests and any replacement stock will come only from approved tested sources . The fattener will return performance details to the organising body so that improvement and its implementation will be dependent on both parties . In partnership the fattener and the group will go forward to meet and beat competition . The group movement as operated in certain areas today will remain the basic framework for any improvement to take place . The breeder will be required to provide certain minimum conditions . These will include an agreed minimum number of sows which will make the ownership of a boar feasible , and also allow for the economic collection of weaners . It would appear that this number should be around twenty . Correct feeding of the sows and litters will be under constant review to ensure optimum production . Farrowing accommodation will also have to meet certain minimum standards although a weaner producer will be judged in the end by the quality of pig he produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present there are certain factors which mitigate against an economic service ' . Undoubtedly these current problems will be overcome and A.I. will have an immediate effect on improvement , but only if top ' boars are used at stud . One of the farmer 's difficulties has been the inability to recognise a sow on heat , as well as the fact that semen can not be stored satisfactorily for more than 72 hours . A well-organised group with a sow total of 6000 could be maintained by an A.I. service with only ten or twelve top-rated boars , and therefore livestock improvement could be vastly speeded up by the intelligent use of A.I. In order to supply large-scale fatteners with the numbers required it is possible that groups will insist on batch farrowing on certain units . The future well-being of groups is going to depend increasingly on members accepting discipline since their future long-term security is dependent upon it . Some authorities believe that the future is likely to lie more with self-contained breeder-feeder than with weaner groups . The basis for this thought being ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit margins making it unlikely that the pig can stand two people 's profit . If this long-term thought is borne out in practice , many of the principles of stock improvement undertaken by groups can be equally beneficially utilised by a breeder-feeder . The purchase of tested boars , genetic recording and home gilt testing are avenues which can be followed to advantage . Indeed , many of the larger progressive units are embarking on these lines already . // Factors affecting Indoor and Outdoor Management Systems The major factors governing one 's choice of husbandry will be the best deployment of capital and labour . Building costs and the price of land are bound to rise which will lead to large-scale investigations of methods and systems to reduce costs . In areas of low annual rainfall large-scale extensive systems will have an important place to fill . The Roadnight ' system for outdoor farrowing and rearing is gaining in popularity , particularly in view of its low capital requirements , as far as housing is concerned . The outdoor early weaning technique has proved to be a useful economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production for the fresh ' meat market , i.e. pork , cutters and manufacturing , can be carried out reasonably cheaply out of doors in certain areas . An increasing number of pig producers are using outdoor systems during the more favourable summer months in order to rest and thoroughly clean both fattening and farrowing quarters . Apart from its low cost , the major advantage of any outdoor system is the health aspect , since disease build-up or spread is not usually a serious problem . Another attraction is that there are no dung-disposal headaches which frequently present difficult and costly problems . Among objections raised are labour difficulties in adverse weather // conditions , as well as the provision and maintenance of water , particularly during frosty weather . It is , however , today 's economics which make it necessary to examine completely outdoor systems . The whole question of the ultimate profitability of a breeding enterprise revolves around the annual output of litters or piglets . Three-week Weaning Reducing the suckling period by earlier weaning enables sow output to be increased . On commercial farms it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although weaning at any age between 3 and 8 weeks will be advantageous . The following table illustrates the comparative output of normal versus 3-week weaning programmes : The figure of 15.3 piglets per sow quoted for traditional weaning is somewhat higher than the national average . Although increased output is clearly demonstrated with the early-weaning system , it can not succeed if it is output at any cost . The following table compared fixed costs for teh two systems and is based on experience from various costing schemes : The major reduction in the fixed costs of an early-weaned sow is due to its lower food consumption . This arises from the fact that in early weaning she only requires 18.2 cwt. of food per year , compared with // 25 cwt. for a sow that suckles her litter for the full 8 weeks . Whilst it is true that 6- and 7-week weaning is more widely practised today than hitherto , the economic argument for earlier weaning still holds good . When comparing the systems on the ultimate profit basis a clear picture emerges . This table shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8-week weaning only just betters the figure attained by the average early-weaning producer . Early weaning can be practised throughout the year , either entirely as an outdoor exercise or an outdoor/concrete ( winter ) method . The most important points of management are these : Wean when the piglets weigh 12 lb. ( 3 weeks ) . Provide warm , dry , draught-free huts , arks or other cheap housing // Straw-bale housing is widely used where rainfall is not heavy , using twenty-two bales to form the walls and a few corrugated sheets for the roof . A really good depth of straw bedding is essential . ( See exploded diagram for details . ) After use the straw can be burnt on site . 3 . Allows acre paddock for twenty piglets. 4 . Fresh food and clean water should always be available . 5 . Use the correct specially formulated food for the purpose . 6 . Introduce the piglets to solid food prior to weaning . 7 . Castration , etc. , should be performed before weaning . Many veterinary surgeons nowadays castrate piglets at 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock , and also a smaller incision . 8 . Rest the paddocks every 12 months . The following figures illustrate the average winter and summer results obtained from a carefully recorded group of farms during the period October 1961 ? October 1963 : One development of this system that is taking place is the rearing of piglets from 3 weeks in huts raised off the ground , with an outdoor slatted veranda . This may become very popular as pigmen are not always keen to tend an outdoor system in inclement weather . Indoor Systems Turning to indoor systems we are likely to see fully mechanised units in blocks of up to 400 pigs with a common air space . The writer has seen as many as 2000 pigs in one unit in Sweden , but this is not recommended as the disease risk would appear to be higher in this country . Indoor systems emphasise that management techniques and disease control have to be very carefully studied before embarking on any factory-scale exercise . It is feasible that with a well-organised layout a 300-sow unit ( taking the progeny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two men and a boy . In such a unit sludge handling and automated feeding systems must be employed to the full . Sow and Litter Management The importance of providing adequate farrowing conditions is fully discussed in the section dealing with housing , but the stock themselves must be correctly managed . // A good practice is to thoroughly wash the sow with soapy water followed by a gammexane treatment to eliminate parasites such as lice and also mange prior to going into her farrowing quarters . It is advisable to give the sow which is close to farrowing at least 5 days in which to become acclimatised to her farrowing quarters . This settling-in period is both for physical and bacterial considerations . The infra-red lamps should be switched on 2 days before the event ' to ensure that the pen is dry and warm . The feeding of a bran mash incorporated in the sow food during this stage and for 3 days after farrowing has taken place is to be commended . The question relating to the advisability of the presence of the pigman at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of cases it is unnecessary to aid either the sow or piglets , although many pigs do owe their life to the attendant being on hand . It is wise to observe a gilt farrowing as it is a new experience for her and their reactions vary . With an aggressive or restless sow it pays to be near at hand . A bottle of beer an hour or so before farrowing can have a most soothing effect on a sow which might be troublesome . It is wise for the pigman to remove the afterbirth from the pen before the sow has a chance to eat it . Many stockmen clip the eye teeth of piglets to prevent damage to the udder , and also wounds to the face and ears of piglets fighting for teats . I n many cases more harm than good is done by damage to the piglet 's mouth and gums ? although there are cases where it is necessary . When the young piglets are 3 days of age it is essential to give them iron to prevent anaemia either as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The injection probably has most to commend it as only one administration is required , and there is also no doubt that the piglet has received the full dose . Care must be taken to use clean needles otherwise one may encounter abscesses . The other methods mentioned have to be repeated , but are cheaper . Creep feeds , which should be introduced at 10 ? 14 days of age , normally contain iron , and therefore the danger period is over when feeding on solid food commences . The art of creep feeding is to encourage the piglets to eat the maximum quantity as this not only results in heavier 8-week weights , but also reduces the strain on the sow . The introduction of solid food should take advantage of the piglet 's natural curiosity , and initially a small quantity should be sprinkled on the floor or shallow dish . It is a mistake to place a hopper or large container holding food and then expect the piglets to start eating it readily . In the early stages food given daily is the wisest policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption of 25 ? 30 lb. per piglet to 8 weeks of age . The food conversion of pigs under 8 weeks of age is approximately 1.5:1 and therefore it is economically sound to take advantage of this and to produce maximum weights at weaning . In the past there have been arguments against heavy weaning weights // claiming adverse effects on carcass grading . The following table taken from a P.LD.A. survey demonstrates the effect of weaning weight on grading and age at slaughter . From these figures it is abundantly plain that care taken over the management of creep feeding pays handsome dividends . The correct age for the castration of male piglets varies between one pigman and another . It has been the practice on our own farms to carry out this operation between 3 and 7 days . Apart from the pig breeder , there is no reason why the commercial pig farmer should not have the task performed by the time the piglets are 3 weeks old . At an early age the young pigs are no bother to catch and hold and the wound heals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fattening is rarely seen today as any advantage is slight . Traditionally weaning has taken place at 8 weeks because in theory it is possible to produce two litters from each sow in 12 months . In practice this is rarely achieved and has led to widespread weaning at 6-7 weeks of age . Whichever age is chosen it is sound husbandry to take the sow from the litter to reduce any check which weaning itself may cause . Leaving the newly weaned litter in its accustomed surroundings for just 2 days can considerably reduce stress . Irrespective of the weaning age oestrus will occur in sows some 3-8 days later , and in today 's economic climate no commercial pig producer can afford to miss this period . Service should be supervised to ensure that the sow is ready and also that the boar performs satisfactorily . The practice of running a boar with a bunch of sows or gilts is not to be recommended . This latter method makes recording difficult as service is not always observed and the farrowing date is then unknown . Too often if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boar will only serve the one which stands most readily . With controlled service one is able to limit the amount of work each boar does and thus ensure that the quality of semen at each service is of a high standard . Boars should not have much more than 3-4 services per week when mature and fewer for younger males introduced into the herd . With young boars the first sow should be fully on heat and stand as steady // as a rock . Nothing puts a youngster off quicker than the frustration of chasing a sow or gilt not fully on heat . Housing . When considering housing it is fundamentally important to deal with the requirements of the pig , rather than build it around what mechanical devices or labour dictate . Mechanical aids to feeding , cleaning and ventilation are bound to become of far greater economic importance in the future , but not at the expense of pig comfort . Insulation . Heat loss must be kept to a minimum for efficient pro duction ? hence if pigs are cold a large percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can easily amount to half a pound of food per pig per day . The insulation required is as follows : Table For calculation of U ' values , see page 189 . Roof . It is usually necessary to insulate piggeries irrespective of their basic construction , but the cost when measured by improved perfor mance is usually economical since 50 per cent of the heat loss is from the roof . // The usual construction encountered today is corrugated asbestos although aluminium is becoming increasingly popular and it has the advantage of easy erection due to its light weight and also lengths of 25 ft. are quite common . The conventional materials such as asbestos , galvanised iron , tiles , etc. , are poor insulators and therefore require greater insulation . The method of insulation will depend upon the height and pitch of the roof . In the case of high roofs a false ceiling is advocated . Glass wool ( 2 in. ) or polystyrene ( 1 ? 2 in. ) are excellent insulating materials , but a vapour seal to prevent warm moist air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheeting is adequate for this purpose , and should be placed on the stock side ' of the insu-lation , directly above the inner lining , normally a flat asbestos sheet . Thus : This type of roof construction gives a U ' value of 0.1 . In a new building the easiest method is to buy or build this type of sandwich construction in one unit . Walls . The most common materials used are concrete blocks and brick , but these have poor insulating qualities . In the modern package deal ' houses , the outer shell may consist of exterior grade resin-bonded plywood . By the simple expedient of providing a cavity between the outer and inner shell the U ' value will be reduced by approximately 50 per cent . For ease of cleansing and disinfection it is advisable to render the surface of the wall in contact with the stock . Floors . With concrete floors insulation is advisable in the sleeping areas . A concrete floor without insulation has a U ' value of only 0.7 . By using straw bedding this factor is considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air space or other insulant must be incorporated in its construction . The materials suggested for this purpose are hollow tiles or insulation blocks , egg trays , polystyrene , etc . It is also important to lay a damp-proof course ( to prevent moisture rising ) consisting of polythene sheeting , roofing felt or a sealing liquid . The build up of the floor is therefore : // It is advisable to plan the fall of the piggery floor from the concrete stage ; all too often tradesmen do not allow sufficient fall ( 1:36-72 ) . Ventilation . Much of the value of good insulation is lost if it is not coupled with efficient ventilation , and if this has led to any reduction in air space , this will mean warmer air with an increase in humidity . This may result in respiratory disorders , and only carefully thought out ventilation can overcome the problem . It is better to calculate ventilation requirements by cubic feet per minute per 100 lb. liveweight than air changes per hour . The aim with pigs should be 20 ? 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250 cu . ft. per minute for a sow and litter . The natural method using chimney extractors has several disadvantages such as lack of control , need for frequent manual adjustments , siting of the building to ensure free external flow of air around the building and also height above the ground-level of the top of the chimney ' . The ideal height above the ground being 25 ft . Mechanical ventilation using correctly sited thermostats ( as near pig level as possible ) is more easily controlled and more reliable . Hand in hand with the extractors must be well-spaced inlets , positioned as high as possible to avoid draughts , allowing 5 sq . ft. of inlet area to each 1000 cu . ft. extracted . For fan capacities see page 193 . Roof Ventilation . There are several variations on the standard ' ridge ventilation method . In intensive units with a large concentration of pigs in a given area , it is often more satisfactory to extract from the dunging passage , which can either be sited centrally or along the outer walls . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of extraction coincides with the highest point in the house . With the more traditional passages along the outer walls air can be brought in at the ridge by chimneys or central ducting . The ducting can be constructed of wood , light alloys , insulation board , polythene or calico-type material . It is essential that all ducts or extraction chimneys are well insulated to avoid condensation . Pressurised Systems . Another method gaining in popularity is the fully pressurised system where air is pulled ' into the piggery by a fan or fans placed in the centre of the gable end or normal chimneys . Where the gable-end method is adopted care must be taken to have good con1 ml to prevent draughts from the ducting , which is overcome by the use of calico ducting . Houses with outdoor runs are generally easier to ventilate but it is often difficult to maintain an even temperature . humidity . The adverse effect of high humidity with poor ventilation has been mentioned previously . Little is known about the exact requirements for pigs but performance is usually satisfactory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurement can be taken // quite easily by means of a whirling hygrometer . From present know-ledge it would appear therefore that provided the pigs are housed in a well-insulated and ventilated atmosphere humidity is not of great importance . However , Irish sweat boxes ' seem to contradict this statement ! Room Temperatures . The relevant temperatures are : Although the temperatures quoted are considered to be ideal , the most important factor is to avoid serious condensation . This is where efficient insulation and ventilation play their part . Farrowing Crates . According to P.I.D.A. figures , about 25 per cent of all live pigs born today are lost in the first week or so of life . In the majority of cases the losses are not due to disease , but to overlying by the sow , etc . It is also well known that piglet mortality is dramatically reduced as the birthweight is increased ; this can be brought about by correct feeding , breeding and the avoidance of bullying . Increased birthweights can not overcome the fact that the sow weighs about 350 ? 400 lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore necessary to provide condi tions which are comfortable for the sow and also capable of protecting the piglets . The wider acceptance of the farrowing crate or its modifications has greatly helped this problem . The normal crate is constructed of tubular steel , wood or concrete and is generally 2 ft. 6 in. wide where the sow lies . The space between the floor and the lower rail or partition should be 9 ? 10 in . It is an advantage to have this lower rail adjustable so as to accommodate the varying sizes of sow . The crate need only be about 3 ft. high and the usual width between the top rails is I ft. 9 in. to 2 ft . The length of the crate should be governed by an adjustable gate at the rear which allows the length to be varied between 7 and 8 ft . A creep area is provided along both sides of the crate which should be I ft. 6 in. to 2 ft. wide and of similar length to the crate . The total area required by each crate unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is helpful to have a narrow passage along the front for ease of feeding the sow and a wider passage at the back for cleaning out , etc . A feed trough and water bowl are provided at the front of the crate . The divid ing partition between each unit need only be 1 ft. 6 in. to 2 ft. high , constructed of wood , hardboard or some other light removable material . This ensures that the crate area can be thoroughly cleaned between farrowings . As such crates are rarely used for periods of more than 3 weeks by the sow and litter , it is not necessary to remove the sow for exercise . If the crate is to be occupied for a longer time the creep area should be of at least the maximum width suggested . Infra-red lamps // ( 250 ? 150 watts ) should be placed over the creep area to attract the piglets away from the sow . If artificial heat is provided in the farrowing unit the lower wattage infra-red bulb ( 150 watts ) is sufficient . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and then the sow and piglets are transferred to a more open ' rearing pen . The basic crate layout as described can be modified , adapted or improved upon . For example , the creep area can be covered with a plywood roof ' ; the chore of cleaning out can be reduced by use of slats ; sloping sides can be installed so that the sow gradually eases her way to a lying position , etc . Under-floor heating by electric cables is also being investigated at the present time . There are many efficient systems just utilising farrowing rails , gates , rings , voluntary farrowing nests or frames the primary aim in all cases is the protection of the young piglets . The follow-on rearing pen is generally of open design with 15 ? 20 sq . ft. of creep area and about 60 ? 70 sq . ft. for the sow . This accommodation should be maintained at a temperature of around 70 ? F. Fattening Accommodation . This aspect of housing today is taking two basic forms either totally enclosed controlled environment ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most commonly found both in new constructions and in modernised existing piggeries . There are four basic designs in use today : the Danish piggery with dunging passages along the outer walls and a central feeding passage ; the central dunging passage type with two narrow feeding passages beside the outside walls ; the long narrow pen with a cat-walk between each row of pens : and finally the type which is virtually an outer shell with slatted dunging passages along the outside wall and with pen divisions of tubular steel or wood . The Danish-type house which was introduced between the wars has been too readily decried , for so long as the ventilation and insulation are adequate , pigs usually thrive well in this type of house . It has two features which we are tending to overlook today trough feeding , and a restriction to about ten pigs per pen . There is increasing evidence which shows that as the number of pigs per pen is increased the performance tends to be poorer . The normal Danish house has pens which are 10 ft. long , 6 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a 4 ft. feeding passage . The dunging area can be slatted to bring it into line with modern thinking . The central dunging passage type piggery has the advantage of easier ventilation . Another point in its favour is that the outer walls need not he pig proof ' , as the stock never come into contact with them . On the question of cost ? one wide slatted dunging passage is considerably heaper than two . The requirement for the dunging area should be 3 sq . ft. per pig . The long narrow pen is basically similar to the McGuckian style , // but the division between the sleeping and dunging area is not always provided , as it may have a slatted dunging passage . There are factorybuilt houses of this type on the market divided into rooms with two pens per room . The cat-walk which has the trough down the centre is usually I ft. wide . This is wide enough for the stockman as the pen fronts slope inwards towards the pen , usually about 16 ft. long and 6 ft. wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consideration it is quite simple to restrict floor space by the use of a hurdle across the narrow pen . The final type of house which the writer thinks could have an important place to fill in the years ahead is one with no permanent internal fittings . Slatted dunging passages with water bowls placed along the outer walls and tubular or wooden divisions give the flexibility for varying pen size . This has the great advantage of being totally dismantled for cleaning when fattening is based on a batch system . In nearly all new constructions slatted dunging passages are installed . The materials used for slats are mostly made of concrete , weldmesh ' or metal T-bars . Wooden slats do not appear to be very practical . The gap allowed is either a in. or a in. , depending upon the material chosen and the age of the pigs . There have been few piggeries constructed in this country with the whole floor area slatted , so that little information of value about this practice is known . Slatted dunging passages will continue to gain in popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought must be given to the handling of the dung itself from the pit or channel . Low-cost prefabricated package deal ' houses make a great appeal , but are dependent on a high stocking density in conjunction with floor feeding . If the recommendations of the Brambell Committee are accepted much rethinking will be required . Their suggested sleeping area per pig will tend to increase the menace of pigs fouling the bed . There is much to be learned in the management of intensive floor-feeding units and the incidence of vices such as tail biting . One common factor in nearly every case of tail biting is that the pigs have no bedding , i.e. straw , but straw is not conducive to the efficient use of slats . Sweat Boxes . Although opinions differ Irish sweat boxes ' appear to have overcome many of the health problems previously encountered by this system 's pioneer , Mr. J. Jordan . In essence the house is an uninsulated shell 8 ft. wide and 16 ft. deep ; ventilation is by means of a stable-door and a window on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls or floor . A slatted dunging passage is provided at the front of the pens and floor-feeding water bowls supplying either whey , skim milk or water . Both the temperature and humidity are constantly at a high level and the walls are generally wet from condensation . Management must be of a high order and it is generally true to say that many of those who have tried to copy Mr. // Jordan have failed to provide the optimum requirements . As labour is the all-important consideration today it is unlikely that there will be any widespread use of this system , which may have popularity in Ulster where unemployment is above average and odours less important . Interesting developments into other forms of intensive housing are i ; tking place at present , such as the ' Swedish ' radial house . This is laid out like a wheel , the hub being a slatted dung area and pen divisions being gates . Experience of this system in Britain is as yet very limited , but the B. S. &; B. ' Bacon Bin ' offers many very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air systems , these are // likely to make the greatest appeal in grain-growing areas or where straw is freely available . Whenever the pig has access to fresh air one has to be careful not to reduce the internal temperature of the house unduly . One development which overcomes this problem is the house devised by Philip Solari . In essence it is a low wooden kennel under a Dutch barn roof . The temperature in the kennel is manually adjusted by means of the hinged lids . The kennels are normally 3 ft. high and the enclosed area 10 ft. by 7 ft . In the original design the dunging area was 10 ft. by 6 ft. with a 1 ft. 6 in. drop from the pen . The reason for the size and depth of the dunging area being such that the dung can build up through the liberal use of straw . A feeding passage is provided in the centre and feeding troughs placed along the passage wall . There are several variations on this theme such as no troughs for floor or ad-lib . feeding ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . This type of housing has the advantages of low cost , pig health , less disease spread risk and fewer ventilation problems . The major disadvantage is that it is difficult for the stockman to inspect the pigs . From a health and cost angle this method has much to commend it . Where large numbers of pigs are kept under cover deep straw yards can provide the answer under skilled management . Dry Sow Housing . The importance of individual feeding has been recognised for several years and most of the better types of sow yard have feeding stalls incorporated . A recent development has been the introduction of the sow stall . The idea originated in Scandinavia and was taken up by enthusiasts particularly in the north-east of Scotland . The stalls allow the sow sufficient room to stand up or lie down but not enough to turn round . The stalls are generally constructed of tubular steel , concrete , brick or wood . The normal size is 2 ft. 6 in. wide , 7 ft. long and 3 ft. high . A rear gate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water bowl are provided . Some provide a slatted area at the rear , others rely on daily manual cleaning . Many pig farmers today who are convinced that the system is correct are awaiting the outcome of possible legislation following the Brambell recommendations . The Committee 's major objection was that there was no provision for exercise . From experience to date there has been no reduction in sow output and no greater incidence of leg or arthritic conditions . In fact it is fair to say that the national sow herd loss through bullying would probably be reduced by the widescale use of such stalls , but in our experience it appears to be essential that the stalls are housed in a warm insulated building . In larger units the writer believes that mechanised feeding and cleaning will be worth the high costs involved . Future Housing Trends . As skilled stockmen are getting fewer there must be greater developments to make their task easier . We are already // seeing the increased use of slatted floor dunging passages , mechanical scrapers , etc. , and this trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into food handling , both from the food store and into the trough . We are seeing an increasing use of the electrical time switch to govern the pigs ' meal times . Systems such as ( i ) the dispenser which will drop a predetermined quantity of food on to the floor or into a trough , ( ii ) large mobile hoppers which are tripped to allow the food to fall in the correct quantities , and ( iii ) the wet pipeline , are all due to be tested on a large scale . Any development which is not to the detriment of the pig and allows the stockman to use his managerial skills to the full is to be welcomed . Chapter 10 NUTRITION OF THE INTENSIVELY MANAGED PIG D. G. FILMER Introduction The last decade has seen a considerable advancement in pig housing , husbandry and disease control . At the same time improved methods of genetic selection have led to superior strains of pig now capable of faster and more efficient performance . It is felt that the pace of progress will increase during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems of production including controlled environment conditions . Big changes in the structure of the industry are likely to take place with an increasing proportion of the pig population in fewer and fewer hands . Under such systems of intensive husbandry where high performances are expected and the risk of additional stress is increased , the nature of the diet fed at all the various stages of production becomes critical . Under less intensive systems with sows and weaners on grass with plenty of sunlight , fresh air and exercise , ally nutritional deficiencies in the diet offered were often able to be made good by rooting . In this way pigs would ingest many essential minerals , vegetation and small animal and insect life as well as waste organic matter discarded or excreted by other classes of farm stock . Grazing itself can supply a good quantity of protein which in the spring is of high quality and which also contains relatively high levels of riboflavin ( vitamin B2 ) and carotene ( the precursor of vitamin A ) . The action of sunlight on the skin in providing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances the pig exercises its natural role as a scavenger and the diet fed is simply a supplement supplying extra energy and protein and balancing the mineral intake . There is no doubt that such extensive systems , providing temperatures are reasonable , are very healthy particularly for breeding stock , but pressure of cost and availability both of land and labour are more frequently forcing a much less natural , if not unnatural , lifetime existence for the pig . Modern pig nutrition aims to supply in each diet the relevant quantities and balance of all nutrients necessary for the most economic performance of the pig for each stage of the productive cycle . Available Nutrients It is now universally accepted in technical circles that apart from the obvious facts that a diet must be palatable and non-toxic , the features 116 // which determine the suitability of the diet to the type and class of pig under consideration , are its content of available nutrients . Instead of regarding a diet as a mixture of raw materials such as barley , wheat offals , fish meal , yeast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the available nutrient content of the diet . This may be described in terms of digestible and/or metabolisable energy ( kcal. /kg. ) , available amino acid contents ( percentage of diet ) , and mineral and vitamin content ( mg. /kg. or p.p.m . ) . With regard to the last units it should be noted that milligrams per kilogram ( mg. /kg. ) equals parts per million ( p.p.m. ) , and that grams per U.K. ton ( 2240 lb. ) is a close approximation to this since 1 U.K. ton contains just over l million grams ( actually 1,016,047 grams ) . Thus expressing vitamins and mineral levels in the diet as p.p.m. or mg. /kg. , immediately gives the number of grams of the nutrient that must be contained in each U.K. ton . The mixed term mg. /lb. should be avoided in this country for it is neither scientific nor does it help the formulator in translating requirements into practical diets . In the United States where the ton contains 2000 lb. , the term may be of assistance to the practical nutritionist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more common . The description of diets in terms of their nutrient content rather than their percentage raw material make-up has many advantages . In the first place it takes into account the variability in available nutrient content that frequently takes place between batches of the same named raw material . For example the available lysine content of fish meal can vary from 3.5 to 4.8 per cent and that of meat and bone meal from 1.6 to 2.5 per cent . Obviously one formula , made up with the better quality fish meal and meat and bone meal , would be much more valuable to the animal than the same mixture of raw materials but from the poorer source . To obtain consistent performance it is more important to vary the percentages of raw materials in the diet whilst retaining the same levels of available nutrients , rather than stick slavishly to a formula when the nutrient values of raw materials are known to be variable . Formulating to an available nutrient standard allows for variability of raw materials ; formulating to a fixed level of raw materials ignores it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and palatability considerations are taken into account and that no toxins are present , then all formulations containing the same levels of available nutrients but from differing raw materials will give the same performances when fed to pigs . Since this is so , it is important to the farmer that he supplies his pigs with the correct balance of nutrients in the most economic way . Using a fixed formula does not take account of this . Formulating to a nutrient standard allows flexibility to accommodate changes in analysis and market prices of raw materials , so as to provide a diet of constant nutrient content which shall always be least cost ' to the user . // In addition it is apparent that progress in pig nutrition has advanced considerably since the basic amino acids have been considered , rather than the nitrogen or crude protein content of the diet . It is now known that some specific amino acids such as lysine have a considerable effect on the growth , efficiency and carcass quality of pigs , and this has led to the decreased use of low lysine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The construction of experimental diets differing only in levels of one nutrient has led to a much clearer understanding of the relationship between nutrient levels in the diet and resultant performance of pigs when fed these diets . Lastly , having regard to available nutrients has led to a different approach to the economic assessment of diets . Normally of course , the cost of a diet is regarded as the sum of the costs of all raw materials in the formula plus milling and other charges . However since it is nutrients that stock need to perform on , it is relevant to see if the costs of a diet may be related to the nutrient content of that diet . Once a least cost ' diet has been calculated it is indeed possible to break down the total on-farm costs into the cost of energy , amino acids including lysine , methionine , etc. , minerals such as calcium and phosphorus , vitamins , fatty acids , etc . The total of the costs of all nutrients taken into account in formulating the diet then adds up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy for example is the quantity of energy in one ton of food times the unit cost of energy , this being deduced in the calculation . Examination of these costs of nutrients , and more specifically the unit costs of nutrients , can be very helpful in planning research work , devising new diets etc . For example one can often find that the specified level of one nutrient may be very expensive to attain , whereas the specified level of another important nutrient may contribute very little to the total cost of the diet . A further important nutrient may cost nothing to include in the diet for , in satisfying the other nutrient levels , the required level of this further nutrient may automatically be satisfied . These cost/nutrient level relationships will be discussed in more detail later . Nutrient Requirements Having regarded a diet as a vehicle for the provision of available nutrients to stock , it behoves us to decide what levels of nutrients are appropriate to each class of stock . As far as pigs are concerned there is less published information available in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due first to the fact that research with poultry is cheaper to carry out due to the individual cost of a hen and its housing being considerably less than a pig and its housing . Secondly , due to hybridisation , variation within a strain of hens is less than within a strain of pigs . Then there are management differences which often make it // simpler for research on hens to fit in easier at a University or other research establishments rather than pigs . Again it is easy to arrange for several hundred ( or thousand ) day-olds to come onto an experiment together , whereas the organisation of even 50 ? 100 weaners to start an experiment together is full of practical problems . In this country there is no recognised publication which has summarised data on the nutrient requirements of pigs although a committee has been set up by the Agricultural Research Council to examine this subject and report . ( This report is now available ; The Nutrient Requirements of Farm Livestock , No 3 , Pigs ) . However considerable data have become available from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture is much clearer now than even a few years ago . Nevertheless much work remains to be done . In the United States , the National Research Council have produced tables in Publication No. 1192 Nutrient Requirements of Swine . This booklet summarises research to 1964 and had been used by many as a guide both inside and outside the United States . It is important to realise that nutrient requirements relate to the pig and not the diet , and although this point may seem obvious , it is quite common to hear well-known figures in the pig industry talk of the requirement of the bacon pigs for lysine , say , as 0.75 per cent . What matters of course is the daily intake of nutrients per pig . These should be specified as calories of energy and weights of each amino acid , mineral and vitamin per pig per day . It is quite possible of course to provide the daily requirements of say a fattening pig in either a larger or smaller parcel of food . For example , a normal diet may provide sufficient nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5. + lb. of food per day , whereas by using higher energy raw materials and better quality proteins , including perhaps synthetic amino acids , the same quantity of nutrients may be packed into say 5 lb. or even 44 lb. of food . This would of course require a greater concentration of nutrients by some 10 or 20 per cent respectively but it is important to realise that all three diets would provide the daily requirements of nutrients when fed at the appropriate levels per day . ( Further one could dilute a diet by the addition of a non-nutritional filler such as cellulose , and , to obtain the equivalent daily nutrient intake , 6 or 7 lb. per day may be required . ) Nutrient Density Thus it is impossible to dissociate nutrient levels in the diet with levels of feeding in order to arrive at the critical daily nutrient intake . The differences in concentration of nutrients within the above various diets is referred to as Nutrient Density and it is of interest to study the effects of increasing nutrient density of the diet , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Reference to Fig. 12 indicates that unit costs of the diet increase as nutrient density increases . However it will be noted that whereas unit costs increase slowly at first , they increase rapidly at very high nutrient densities . The nutrient density which provides the daily nutrient requirement at least cost is found by constructing a tangent to the curve passing through the cost origin . As this origin will be affected by milling and other costs which may be variable from one part of the country to another , as well as price differentials between raw materials which often vary , the nutrient density supplying the daily nutrient intake cheapest ( optimum nutrient density ) is subject to variation . However , for a given product , variation is not normally great but could soon be radically changed if for example fats become economic sources of energy and synthetic amino acids become much less expensive . This would quickly alter the optimum nutrient density and the restricted use of a high fat diet , suitably supplemented by synthetic amino acids , could then become a very economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons why energy levels of commercial diets for similar classes of pig in the U.S.A. differ from those in the U.K. Apart from a difference in end product requirement ( which may be more a result than a cause ) , commercial U.S. diets cost least per calorie when based on cheap maize and are thus high-energy diets resulting in fatter carcasses , but often quicker growth and certainly better conversions . Maize is less often economic on a calorie basis in this country than home grown materials , and // optimum nutrient densities are likely always to be less in the U.K. than the U.S.A. For this reason one must be careful in translating the N.R.C. recommendations into British or Continental feeding and economic conditions Table 1 has been extracted from a table in the N.R.C. booklet and includes the levels of energy taken in when ad-lib . systems of feeding are practised . They mention that under such a system pigs will eat less of a high than a moderate energy diet and this has also been noted in this country . However with our present strains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcass with resultant downgrading , and restriction of energy intake is necessary . In this case the N.R.C. point out that the same daily levels of nutrients other than energy should be fed . Simple calculation shows that if the level of feeding is restricted to 6 lb. per day then a 16 per cent protein diet is needed to 175 lb. liveweight . Using a high-energy , more efficient diet and restricting to 51 lb. would require 17 per cent protein to obtain the 0.94 lb per day crude protein suggested to 175 lb. liveweight . More important than total protein intake , of course , is the amino acid make-up of that protein , and much research remains to be done before a complete understanding of amino acid interrelationships and energy interactions are properly established . The N.R.C. quote figures which they suggest are minimum practical levels for normal growth and performance ' . It will be seen from Table 2 that the summary of American findings shows incomplete data for some classes of pig whilst no data at // all are presented for sows , or growing pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement ' as minimum practical levels for normal growth and performance ' raises the question of what normal ' growth is , and whether performance means just food conversion or includes some aspects of carcass quality . One wonders whether these standards apply to fast and slow growing strains , lean as well as fatter strains , and to both sexes . Nutrient Responses ? Response Curves More recently important British work has been identifying and measur ing , as precisely as possible , the effects of graded daily intakes of individual amino acids on specific production parameters , such as rate of growth , food conversion and percentage lean in carcass . This has been carried out at various universities and commercial research centres and the pattern that has emerged is quite clear-cut . The method has been to select one amino acid in the diet which may be thought to be most limiting performance , and to construct a series of diets all containing the same levels of all nutrients other than the // amino acid under examination . This amino acid is then included at a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same feeding scale . By means of carefully designed and replicated experimental work , the effects of these various levels are detected as they affect all aspects of production , and the results used to construct graphically the relation between daily intake of the amino acid and each measure of production . These input ? output relationships or response curves , can then be interpreted in the light of what measure of performance one wishes to maximise or optimise . It will be seen that maximum liveweight gain is achieved before lowest food conversion is reached and that lean meat content of the carcass continues to increase even at very high lysine intakes well above those necessary for lowest food conversion . Moreover the responses to increased lysine are greatest at the lowest end of the scale , but the law of diminishing returns applies as levels of lysine are in-creased further . There is thus no absolute fixed minimum requirement ' for lysine for bacon pigs : different levels simply alter the performance of the pigs . Interpretation of the above information is likely to vary dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The farmer presumably would like to obtain improved growth and conversion but would care little about extra lean meat provided his payment grading was good anyway . However the housewife and the meat processer would both be very keen to go to very high lysine intakes to obtain a higher quality end product . The attitude of the compounder could well // vary dependent on whether he had a fixed or expanding market and whether he felt the extra performance at high lysine intakes could be readily demonstrated to his customers , for he would have to face the fact that the extra lysine would increase the cost of his compound . Lysine Economics ? Marginal Returns A rational approach to the situation would be to refer to the unit costs of including lysine in the diet at the various levels , when it would be found that increasing lysine by a given small amount at the lower end of the lysine scale costs very little per ton of food ( at this stage the return in animal performance is at its greatest ) . However at the higher end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs of increasing lysine by the same given small amount becomes very high , as very concentrated expensive sources of nutrients have to be used . There is thus a level of lysine where the marginal cost of increasing the level by a small increment , is just balanced by the value of the marginal increment of animal response obtained ( marginal return ) . This then sets an upper limit to the level of lysine which is economic and it should be noted that this level is going to depend on two factors : ( a ) The unit cost of lysine . This can vary dependent on the relative price structure of the high lysine and low lysine raw materials , and can be subject to quite large changes . ( b ) The value of the end product . If the average value of the finished pig rises , it will obviously pay to go further up the lysine response curve , to obtain a greater profit . The converse applies if the value of the pig reduces . Because of these two variable factors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will either be necessary for the nutritionist to keep the level under constant review , or to build an automatic device into the diet specification in respect of lysine , which ensures that , taking the response curve into account , the right ECONOMIC level of lysine is included at all times . Nutrient Responses ? Response Surfaces If one examines the lysine response curves in Fig. 13 , it may be considered that the reason for the law of diminishing returns having effectively produced a maximum growth rate above which no further increase in lysine led to further improvement , is probably because at that stage a second nutrient became limiting upon performance . It is of interest from a research point of view to establish what is the second limiting nutrient and to consider how best to investigate it . It is well known that amino acid auto analysers are now widely used in universities and commercial research centres for establishing amino acid contents of raw materials and finished diets for pigs and poultry . However it is less widely known that techniques are being developed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The object of this // is to identify which amino acids are in excess in the diet ( shown by high peak levels in the blood serum of animals fed this diet ) , and those which are deficient , or limiting to performance ( shown by very low peak levels in the blood serum ) . The ideal diet would of course lead to blood serum which had a very low level of all amino acids indicating that the end products of digestion were being produced in exactly the right proportions for the productive process . The above method may be tried as a short cut to the determination of the second limiting amino acid(s) , or more frequently the amino acid content of the diet may be determined ( either by analysis or calculation from tables ) , and compared with estimated minimum requirements ' obtained from the rather sparse literature . The sulphur containing amino acids , methionine and cystine together with tryptophane and isoleucine , are most likely to be second limiting amino acids in practical pig fattening diets . There are two methods of investigating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basal diet at the same level of lysine as produced a high performance previously , and to formulate a diet series varying only in the second amino acid . This can then yield a response curve ( provided a sufficient range is chosen ) : or secondly one can take say four levels of the first limiting amino acid at equal intervals , two either side of the performance peaks , and at each level include say four levels of the second amino acid . This produces a sort of grid of sixteen experimental diets , and with sufficient replication four response curves to both amino acids , one at each of the four levels of the other , will be produced . When cut out and fitted together , these then produce a response surface , and it then becomes clear whether the response to one amino acid depends on the level of the other . If so , valuable information as to the relationship or interaction results . Lysine/Energy Interactions The effect of increased energy in the diet of finishing pigs is well known in that it improves rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal daily food intakes ; but decreases carcass lean and consequent grading . However when the diet is restricted so as to equate daily energy intake , then provided daily intake of other nutrients is similar , work has shown no increase in carcass fatness . In order to obtain the benefits of normal level feeding of high energy finishing diets , many workers have examined the effects of increased protein or more specifically increased amino acid contents of the diet . Results have been somewhat variable , in part no doubt due to different basal diets and partly to different strains and breeds of pig involved . Work which we have done with 212 Large Whites taken to bacon weight , indicated that as energy in the diet is increased , the ratio of lysine to energy must be increased if normal rates of feeding are to be followed without prejudicing carcass quality . // Further work has confirmed that different lysine response curves exist when using a high energy diet than when using a more conventional energy level ( both at equal daily food intakes ) ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmful effect on carcass quality results . The adoption of such high nutrient density diets with suitable stock and management is a matter of economics . Strain/Diet Interactions There is no doubt that response curves yielded by fast-growing strains of lean pigs differ from those of more conventional stock . This is not surprising , for intensive selection over many generations has produced individuals and strains with greatly enhanced growth potential and capacity for very lean carcasses . However , these extra potentials can not be fulfilled if the diet fed does not contain the wherewithal for extra tissue growth to proceed at an advanced rate . High nutrient density diets are readily utilised by such stock , in fact they can not exhibit their true potential unless such diets are fed . One of the advantages of hybrid pigs is likely to be that they will be able to utilise high nutrient diets fed at higher daily intakes that would result in over-fatness and down-grading of more conventional stock . In time the ideal bacon pig may in fact be able to grow at a very fast rate and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such diets . There is also evidence that the two sexes respond differently to differences in energy and in nutrient density . Castrates respond more to high energy and higher nutrient density diets in general than do gilts . There is the probability that uncastrated male pigs , which may well become viewed with more favour for fattening purposes as time goes by , will also exhibit different responses . It is conceivable that different diets or feeding programmes could be devised for the sexes kept separately , which would be nutritionally sound and economically justified . In the meantime it will become important for those engaged in the // genetic selection of the advancing new strains of pig to ensure that they carry out their selection under a nutritional environment which gives the maximum chance for superior strains to exhibit themselves . No poultry breeder with a new light hybrid hen would today carry out his selection using a moderate energy diet , as the strain x diet interaction in laying stock is now firmly established . However 5 years ago similar comments with regard to the commercial as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deaf ear . Trace Nutrient Requirements Since currently much of the research into pig nutrition is concerned with energy and amino acid metabolism , the very important mineral and vitamin function has had less emphasis . It is also probably true that fewer symptoms of straight , nutrient deficiencies are seen now than formerly , due to a better application of available information . However , the nutritional disorders that occur may often be the result of a simultaneous lack of several nutrients resulting in a complex deficiency disease which can be detected only by carefully reviewing diets along with clinical symptoms . It should be noted that actual nutritional deficiency or insufficiency may exist without the appearance of definite symptoms other than lowered appetite and subnormal rate of gain . It is more helpful , perhaps , to envisage a dose-response curve relating level of a mineral or vitamin to rate of growth . Traditional symptoms are unlikely to occur unless a severe deficiency occurs , but a sub-optimal level could have a marked effect on growth , and additional levels could then result in increased economic performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stress can increase the requirement for both minerals and vitamins . The N.R.C. publication 1192 states Furthermore one should recognise that if a deficiency occurs it may be due to differences in nutrient requirements of individual animals , caused by genetic differences usually found in the average swine population . Thus the uncertainty of diagnosis of ration inadequacy must be recognised . A positive diagnosis should seldom be made on the basis of the observation of only one of the clinical effects expected to follow the deficiency in question . ' Mineral Requirements Calcium levels in pig diets have been reduced over the past few years as it has been found that excessive calcium increases the levels of other minerals required in the diet , a level of 0.6 per cent is quite adequate for adult stock including breeding stock . Higher levels increase the requirements for zinc in the diet or risk of parakeratosis occurs . In addition phosphorus present as phytate phosphorus in grain , soya bean meal , etc. , is rendered unavailable in the presence of excess calcium , but if the levels mentioned are adhered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 0.4 per cent of the diet are satisfactory . A calcium to // phosphorus ratio ( Ca : P ) of 1.5:1 is now thought to be correct . Adequate vitamin D should also be present in the diet . Cobalt is in chelated form in vitamin B , , and should be present either as the element or preferably in the form of the vitamin . Elemental cobalt is not required if sufficient vitamin B , , ( cyanocobalamin ) is present . Iodine is an essential element in the diet of growing and breeding pigs and must be included in intensive diets or thyroid and fertility upsets will occur . Excess levels can adversely influence the growth of baby piglets . Adequate iron and copper levels are important for haemoglobin formation , and shortages give rise to nutritional anaemia in suckling pigs . It is impossible to supply adequate iron via the sow 's milk , as iron supplements to the sow 's diet have little effect on the iron content of her milk . Ferrous fumarate has been shown to have the biggest effect so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about I mg. of iron per litre of milk whereas young pigs each require about 7 mg. daily ! Iron fed to the pregnant pig however can build up reserves in the livers of the developing embryos . Iron in the diet of the lactating sow can nevertheless be associated with increased iron uptake of the young piglets due to their picking up iron-containing faeces . Injection of young piglets with 150 ? 200 mg. of any of the soluble iron preparations on the market at 1 ? 3 days of age will prevent piglet anaemia . In the absence of this , housed piglets that become chilled , frequently exhibit symptoms of anaemia . This may be due to the chilling upsetting liver function such as when laying on , say , cold concrete , the livers become affected rapidly . Added iron is unnecessary in adult pig diets as the natural supply in feeding-stuffs is adequate , but iron can sometimes have an astringent effect on the dung . British work has indicated that higher levels of copper in the diet of the pig can lead to improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response is similar to that obtained by the use of low levels of antibiotic in the diet ( i.e. 10 ? 20 p.p.m. or grams per ton of diet ) . It is not likely that a high level of copper ( 125 ? 250 p.p.m . Cu added ) gives a growth stimulant effect by nature of there being a nutritional response . Rather is it likely that in some way and under some conditions , the copper may have a beneficial effect on the gut flora , or perhaps assist absorption in some way . It is interesting to speculate why American research , in the main , has failed to substantiate British work . It is quite possible that with intensive management using S.P.F. pigs kept under hygienic conditions , both high copper levels and low level antibiotics will be ineffective . Certainly both of these additives seem to have less effect under field conditions now , than when they were first introduced . Magnesium , manganese , selenium and molybdenum are all essential for efficient performance although the levels required of the last two // are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basal diet . There is growing evidence of complex interactions which exist between groups of two , sometimes three elements , and factors which determine their availability to the animal and function in the body are being elucidated . This is an important field of study which could lead to significant improvements in economic performance of pigs . // For growing stock the rates of feeding associated with the above dietary levels are : Table For breeding stock the rates of feeding associated with the above dietary levels are : Table It is of course important that if lower than these rates of feeding are practised , then the concentration of vitamins in the diet must be adjusted upwards appropriately . Vitamin A is extremely critical for brood sows . Deficiency can have serious effects particularly if a deficient diet is fed over 2 ? 3 successive pregnancies , when a severe drop in pig numbers and the production of piglets with deformed or atrophied eyes result . It is also likely that sub-optimal levels can affect the health of developing embryos and subsequent piglets . However it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vitamin , and provided they have access to grass for even a limited part of the year , they can buffer very effectively the effects of a vitamin A-deficient diet . However where sows do not have access to grass at all ( as is increasingly becoming the case ) , the vitamin A content of the diet is critical . High levels will provide the young piglets with a reserve of the vitamin in their livers , which may act as a safeguard against future disease hazards . The role of vitamin D in stabilising the effects of adverse calcium and phosphorus ratios has been mentioned . The absence of vitamin D leads to rickets and unless pigs have free access daily to the ultraviolet rays of the sun , the diet must contain an adequate level . It should be remembered that pigs are able to utilise both vitamins Dz and D3 whereas poultry utilise only D3 . In commercial rations it is now usual however to use only D3 in diets for all species . Cod liver oil is a rich source of both vitamins A and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stabilised vitamins which retain their potency in a mixed diet for a considerably longer period than does cod liver oil . Vitamin E has long been thought to be associated with fertility in both males and females but the evidence for this is extremely slight . // However feeding a deficient diet can cause increased embryonic mortality and muscular inco-ordination in suckling pigs . Vitamin E is a natural antioxidant , and its action in the body is probably to protect some metabolites and body fats from oxidation . Vitamin C is a further antioxidant but this vitamin is synthesised by the animal in sufficient quantities to meet requirements . However it is possible that with all these vitamins , sub-optimal levels may cause economic losses . The B vitamins collectively are of great importance and low levels can cause the birth of pigs showing malformation of the appendages and nervous disorders characterised by trembling which may be so severe as to prevent suckling . Of most practical importance are Bz ( riboflavin ) , B , , ( cyanocobalamin ) , pantothenic acid and niacin . Vitamin Bz enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins . The dietary requirements increase at low temperatures and also when fat replaces some of the carbohydrate as an energy source in high performance diets . Additional riboflavin is normally added to pig diets either as the pure vitamin or by the addition of dried yeast or liver meal . Vitamin B , , occurs in animal proteins but not in vegetable proteins and is now considered to be the vitamin involved in the so called animal protein factor ' . It contains about 4 per cent of cobalt , is a complex molecule and is concerned in the build-up of nucleic acids involved in protein synthesis . The importance of this vitamin is thus obvious even though minute quantities are required , the unit of measurement for B , 2 , namely microgram , being one thousandth of the measurement of the other vitamins which are assessed as milligrams . The recognition of the value of supplementary sources of pantothenic acid in pig diets has been relatively recent . Pantothenic acid is found in the body as a constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbohydrates and fats , and a deficiency exhibits itself in trembling in newborn pigs , and by locomotor inco-ordination in adults . This can often be recognised by typical goose-stepping of the hind legs . Maize ? soya diets contain little natural pantothenic acid and many British type diets also need supplementation . Niacin or nicotinic acid may be deficient in high cereal-containing diets , for although cereal grains contain this vitamin , it is in a bound form which is not readily available to the animal . The amino acid tryptophane is capable of conversion to this vitamin which is involved in energy metabolism . Thus the tryptophane status of the diet is important when assessing niacin levels . Niacin requirements vary according to protein and fat contents of the diet and the amount and nature of the carbohydrate metabolised . Pyridoxine , choline , biotin , inositol , vitamin K and folic acid are all essential but are unlikely to be deficient in normal diets . However // early weaning and orphan pig diets often need supplementation with these vitamins . The Intensively Kept Sow There are two main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may conveniently be discussed separately . The first function is to produce the maximum number of viable piglets per annum , in order to defray annual depreciation and food costs of the breeding stock as much as possible . Secondly , the sow is expected to provide adequate supplies of milk to enable her litters to thrive and grow strongly so that they may become independent of her at an early age . The two functions are inter-related , for it will be apparent that number of piglets per annum is the product of the average number of piglets born per litter , and the number of litters born per year . The second function of the sow , if well achieved , may enable earlier weaning to take place and so afford the opportunity of reduction in farrowing index and an increase in litters per year . The Pregnant Sow and Gilt It is common for breeding stock to be selected on the basis of their growth and conversion to bacon weight . They are then selected and often placed on a restricted diet . It has been shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full feeding , no adverse effects on subsequent breeding performance results . However the practice of flushing gilts , i.e. increasing their daily food intake 7 ? 14 days before first mating , can give rise to an increased ovulation which may result in one or two more pigs per litter . This flushing ' is likely to have its greatest effect on ovulation following a period of restricted feeding . Puberty in the pig is primarily a function of age not weight and only extreme restriction of intake causes delay in first oestrus . There is some indication that protein deficiency which markedly restricts growth rate , delays onset of oestrus . Deficiences of specific fatty acids , vitamins A or 13,2 may also retard sexual development but within the limits of feeding practices and diets at present normally used , puberty is not likely to be affected . Failure to hold to service is more likely to be due to managemental control of timing etc. , rather than to nutritional problems , but complete embryo mortality at an early stage from nutritional inadequacy can take place . Experimentally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 28 days of pregnancy resulted in 25 per cent being non-pregnant at 28 days , whereas feeding which led to a gain of 6 lb. over the same period resulted in 100 per cent of pigs remaining pregnant . However , provided gilts and sows are kept to a steady increase in weight from conception there would seem to be little advantage from the point of view of embryo mortality of inducing heavy weight-gains . Nevertheless // it has been shown that rate of feeding during pregnancy can influence litter weights , and 3-week weights . Experimentally , sows given supplementary feeding in early pregnancy whilst at pasture showed larger litters , but this may have been due to the correction of a mineral or vitamin deficiency rather than an energy or protein effect . More recently , experiments in which either 3 or 6 lb. of a ration were fed throughout pregnancy , or 3 lb. for the first two-thirds of pregnancy followed by 6 lb. for the last one-third , showed that the higher level of feeding in the final stages improved litter weights . Of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in pregnancy , but in the last one-third , demand becomes heavy and 3 lb. of a normal energy diet is not sufficient to allow of proper development . It is of interest to see that the N.R.C. publication No. 1192 states that sows during gestation consume more energy than required for maintenance and development of pigs during foetal life if fed ad lib. on high or medium energy rations . Energy intake must therefore be restricted and 8200 kcal. digestible energy per day for gilts and 9800 kcal. digestible energy per day for sows is suggested . This is equivalent to 5 lb. and 6 ' -z lb. respectively of a moderate energy diet . One of the difficulties in carrying out experimental work with sows as to the effects of daily intake of nutrients upon size and weight of the litter , apart from large variability from sow to sow , is that the sow is such a very good buffer between the diet and her developing embryos . Deficiencies in the diet may not show up during the first or even after several pregnancies and thus one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation of energy and protein during pregnancy . However one thing is quite clear and that is that excessive feeding during this stage leads to large body-weight increases in the sow of which a good deal is fatty tissue , and that this weight is subsequently lost rapidly during the following lactation . Over-feeding can also result in embryonic losses . Pregnant sows utilise their food much more efficiently than non-pregnant animals of the same weight and age but under-feeding can lead not only to lighter litters and 3-week weights , but can seriously prejudice the growth of a well developed mammary gland upon which the following lactation depends . In this respect it has been shown that mammary development is dependent on good nutrition from the early stages of gestation . It is generally accepted that a minimum of 4 lb. of a normal energy food per sow per day is necessary for normal reproduction , though many prefer to recommend slightly more than this in view of the limited evidence so far on long-term effects . However when considering weights of food per day , one should be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on high energy cereals will provide similar levels of energy to 41-5 lb. of a lower energy diet based on more moderate energy cereal offals . Such a diet may have the advantage of supplying bulk materials , so giving the // animal a feeling of satisfaction on a relatively low nutrient intake and keeping the muscle tone of the gut in good order ready for the heavy demand made during lactation . The Lactating Sow It is well known that the colostrum produced by the sow after parturition is rich in albumin , globulin and also lecithin , vitamins , enzymes , phosphorus , calcium and magnesium . Colostral protein is also rich in leucine , valine and threonine which are constituents of the immune proteins or antibodies . The composition of colostrum changes rapidly soon after parturition and it is essential that each piglet obtains a reasonable quantity within a few hours . The nutrition of the sow appears to have little direct effect upon either the volume or composition of colostrum apart from the vitamin status . The importance of the vitamin make-up of the sow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sow lasts for some 5 days during which time the milk composition changes rapidly to normal milk . The composition of sow 's milk is much richer than cow 's milk containing on average about 20 per cent total solids of which about 8.5 per cent is fat . It is of interest to note that the composition of this fat more closely resembles pig body fat than the milk fat of the cow and other species . There are also some indications that the metabolism of the pig is better geared to the utilisation of fat rather than carbohydrates . It is recognised that the fat content of the diet influences the fat content of sow 's milk but little application of this fact seems yet to have been made . The composition of sow 's milk varies throughout lactation , the protein and ash contents rising steadily while lactose and fat reach a peak at 2 ? 3 weeks and then normally fall . The yield of milk is greatly affected by protein and energy intake of the sow during lactation . Almost linear responses in milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the range 250 ? 750 g. per day , have been recorded although few workers seem to have paid attention to the amino acid intakes . Increased energy intakes have also been shown to increase yield . High plane feeding increases peak yield at 2 ? 3 weeks which is then maintained at a high level , whereas moderate plane feeding leads to relatively low peak yields which decline steadily from the third week . Twenty per cent increases in yield can be obtained by high daily energy intakes at this stage . On the basis of this type of work it has become more usual for high levels of feeding of high energy diets of good protein quality to be recommended during lactation , compared with moderate levels of moderate energy diets of lower protein level and quality for pregnant pigs . There is some evidence that lower levels of feeding whilst in-pig , increase the appetite of such animals , so they are able to consume more readily the higher quantities during lactation when the demand on their resources is greatest . Such a system avoids the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body tissue and thus prevents the wasteful process of successive gain and loss of weight in and out of pregnancy . This enables the young piglet to grow ahead rapidly , for sow 's milk is very efficiently utilised , only 0.8 lb. of milk dry matter being required per lb. of gain . The combination of a high birthweight and a plentiful supply of milk of high quality enables the young piglet to thrive rapidly and with good management , freedom from disease and a highly palatable good quality creep food , weaning should be able to take place around 30 lb. liveweight . However pigs should be eating about 11 ? 11 lb. of creep food per day before they are weaned if no setback is to take place . The complete transference onto solid food at an early age is to be aimed at , for although sow 's milk is very effective in producing growth once the pigs are large enough , it is about twice as efficient to pass energy into the piglets direct rather than via the sow . The sow can then be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in litters per sow per year . Earlier weaning systems than that suggested above , whilst having attractive features in reducing still further sow food and depreciation costs per weaner , have fallen down in practice due to disease incidence in all except outdoor early weaning . This latter system however does not lend itself easily to intensive systems of pig-keeping on a large scale . Nevertheless if the veterinary problems associated with very early weaning can be overcome , the importance of the lactation side of the reproductive cycle could become diminished , and complete diets produced suitable for the purpose . Although this is perhaps a distinct possibility , it is felt that systems of weaning similar to that outlined above are likely to replace traditional 8-week weaning , long beforehand . Chapter 11 SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF IMPROVED PIG BREEDING METHODS R. W. WIDDOWSON History In the United Kingdom the pig , unlike other large farm animals , did not come under the influence of the eighteenth-century cattle improvers , the breeds forming localised populations ; each population and type taking its name from the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wessex , Gloucester Old Spot , Cumberland , Lincoln Curly Coat , Oxford and Sandy Black , Dorset Gold Tip , Welsh , Yorkshire ( later Large White ) . Because of the lack of communications there seems to have been very little breeding between the populations , and cross-breeding as known today was unknown . The pigs had little national economic value , and were mainly kept to provide food for their owners , the cottagers and town dwellers of the new industrial areas . The development , in the later part of the nineteenth century , of the breed societies made the breeds more national in outlook , but the societies seem to have done little for breed improvement . The starting of herd books was really no more than a method of giving the genealogy of any animal . At this time the show societies still do not seem to have acknowledged the existence of the individual breeds for as recently as 1872 the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland at their Dalkeith Show awarded a silver medal to William Ford of Harden Green for boar ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement was carried out until the late 1920s and early 1930s when Price and Stubbs , Davidson and Duckham ( 1929 ) started the Buckinghamshire and East Anglian Pig Recording Scheme . This was the first recording scheme in this country and was designed to measure the fecundity of the sows as well as the 3-week and 8-week weight of the piglets . The 3-week weight was considered to be an estimate of the sow 's milking ability , whilst the 8-week weight gave an indication of the farmer 's management of his small piglets . During this same period British bacon factories , concerned at the poorness of the quality of the pigs for the Wiltshire bacon trade , and fearing the increasing competition from the Danish industry ( which incidentally had as long ago as 1897 been progeny-testing animals ) , started to pay detailed attention to carcass requirements . 136 // They laid down standards , and animals attaining these standards were paid for at higher rates . Some factories , such as Harris of Caine , actually advised on the breed of pigs most suitable for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pig became a direct competitor with humans for food and in the early months of the war the pig indus-try in this country virtually disappeared . The few remaining animals which were left were fed on swill and other products which were unfit for human consumption . At the end of the war when meat was scarce the Government , realising the prolificacy and speed of growth of the pig , induced farmers to go into pig production , and any animal of a heavy weight was highly profitable . Pig Litter Testing In 1950 the British Oil &; Cake Mills , realising that the quality of pigs would have to be improved eventually , started the first testing station of any type in the United Kingdom at Stoke Mandeville . Half litters of pigs were sent in to this station and their bodyweights and food con-version determined , as well as the carcass quality of some of them measured . The feeding of these pigs was ad lib. which allowed full expression of the genetic potential of the animals . Boar Progeny Tests In 1953 Stoke Mandeville began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national scale . The method of testing was similar to the Danish testing system , the main difference being the ad-lib . feeding programme . Under this test , a breeder sent in four teams of pigs , each team consisting of two hogs and two gilts , and the pigs were fed under an identical management system . The dams of the teams were unrelated but all pigs in a team had a common sire , and under this method it was possible to prove the sire . This work continued until 1958 when the Pig Industry Development Authority undertook to carry out boar progeny testing on a national scale . Boar Performance Tests At this stage the British Oil &; Cake Mills turned their attention to the development of ultrasonics and the launching of boar performance testing . It was with this type of test , again the first in this country , that pig improvement was stepped up as sires were able to be tested before being used for breeding purposes . Theoretically no bad boar would ever be used in the National Herd . These tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are now arranging under the Accredited and Elite schemes , to test about 7000 boars per annum . Swedish Landrace The tightening economic conditions which occurred in pig farming in the late 1950s had an influence on the use of genetic techniques in pig // improvement , but undoubtedly the greatest impetus to the improvement of the native British Breeds was the importation in 1956 of pigs of the Swedish Landrace breed . A new herd book was started for these pigs , and the Society , unlike other herd book societies , ran its own boar progeny testing station . The success of the station , together with that of the Landrace breed in the show ring , and also in carcass competitions , caused the breeders of our native pig breeds , in self defence , to improve their animals genetically . However , when one considers the effort which has been given to the development of genetic testing in this country , it is disappointing to note the poor results which have been attained and it is worth while considering the factors which have influenced this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . Scientific Aids in a Modern Breeding Programme 1 . Mathematics . A basic knowledge of the mathematics governing genetics gives an ability to understand and to make more certain that correct animals are selected as future breeding stock . It is important to realise that all biological characters , for example height in man or food conversion in pigs , are controlled by many genes , each having an additive effect so that the animal with its inherited gene background if put into the right environment , can express itself to the maximum of its genetic make-up . It is quite obvious that the different genes which any animal inherits at conception will give it a different potential for various traits , e.g. height , length , or food conversion . If data are taken of the weight , height or for that matter chest measurements of a large number of men , and then set out in graph form it will be found that the curve obtained is relatively uniform . This normal frequency curve ' , showing the distribution characteristic of data of this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistical methods . The example ( Fig. 15 ) by Brookes and Dick ( 1961 ) relates to the frequency distribution of the weights of adult males born in the U.K. ( 1883 ) . If the population is large enough the curve is then completely symmetrical about the mean . By mathematical techniques , the distribution about the mean can be calculated , and this is known as the standard deviation for that population . It is calculated by ascertaining the mean for the population , calculating the difference of each observation from the mean , and squaring this difference , summing all the squared differences ( known as the sum of squares ) and taking the square root of the sum of squares divided by one less than the number of observations . Example : Calculation of standard deviation of shoulder fat thickness in six pigs . The standard deviation gives a measure of the distribution of the // population and it is important because it is mathematically proved that about two-thirds of the total population which were investigated lie under the area of the curve given by ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 per cent ) of animals is better than two standard deviations . Therefore , given the food conversions of a population of pigs fattened in a standard environment , it is possible to calculate ( after
