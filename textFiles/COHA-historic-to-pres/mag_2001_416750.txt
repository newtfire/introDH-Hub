William H. Hastie set new standard by resigning top-level post to protest racism // WHEN , in 1943 , in the midst of the second war " to make the world safe for democracy , " William Henry Hastie took the unprecedented step of resigning as civilian aide to the secretary of war to protest racism , he created consternation in official Washington and set a new standard , the Spingarn Committee said , of character , conduct and courage . Nothing quite like this had ever happened before . Never before  --  or since  --  had an African-American resigned a post on this level to protest racism , and the " bewilderment " behind the scenes in Washington , NAACP Secretary Walter White wrote , was " widespread at a Negro giving up a fat salary and the prestige which goes with a high War Department post solely as a matter of principle . " Echoing the Spingarn citation , White added : " Judge Hastie 's resignation ... sets a new yardstick for courage and integrity whose repercussions will be felt for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders was that Hastie was not a wild  --  eyed radical . The grandson of slaves and the son of a government bureaucrat , he was , in fact , the epitome of the Black Establishment . A graduate of Washington 's elite Dunbar High School and Amherst and Harvard , he had held a number of pioneering posts , including assistant solicitor of the Interior Department and federal district judge in the Virgin Islands , a Black first . Somewhat to the surprise of his major sponsor , Interior Secretary Harold Ickes , Hastie  --  who voluntarily gave up more major federal posts than any other Black  --  resigned from the federal bench in 1939 to return to Howard University as dean of the law school . Photograph " It is a unique art and special skill , this business of being a Negro in America . "  --  Wiliam H. Hastie // It was largely because of these impressive credentials that he was named civilian aide to the secretary of war . What the War Department wanted was a quiet , ceremonial Black to quiet the unprecedented militancy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest segregation and Jim Crow in the armed services and defense industries . What the War Department got was a quiet , brilliant , tenacious infighter who drove his superiors crazy with one of the most skillfully conducted memo wars in the history of federal bureaucracy . That war began soon after the 35-year-old Hastie assumed his new position on November 1 , 1940 . A Black operating at the highest levels of the War Department was a new phenomenon to the generals and bureaucrats , who believed generally , according to numerous internal memos , that Blacks were emotionally and intellectually incapable of leading troops or operating complicated machinery . When the generals continued to turn out Jim Crow orders , blithely ignoring Hastie and his all-Black office , the civilian aide went to the secretary of war and won a major bureaucratic victory . On December 18 , 1940 , an order went out to the chiefs of arms and services and the General Staff that " matters of policy which pertain to Negroes , or important questions arising thereunder , will be referred to Judge William H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for comment or concurrence before final action . " Pressing this advantage , Hastie and his aides , Chicago Attorney Truman K. Gibson Jr . and Louis R. Lautier , inundated the bureaucracy with memorandums and letters demanding desegregation and new opportunities for Black officers and specialists . All this , as can be imagined , alarmed War Department officials . As early as March 1941 , a G-1 officer told his superiors that it was necessary to check Hastie or " the whole program may get out of hand . " In a later memorandum , a hostile White officer complained about the effectiveness of the Hastie effort . " The War Department , " he wrote , " is confronted ... with a condition that bids fair to be insidious , even cancerous . Judge Hastie makes no bones about it that the time for minorities to make their gains is the time of national emergency . With utmost frankness , then , it is the purpose of Judge Hastie and his backers to advance the colored people as a race at the expense of the Army . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he intends to go from one disputed point to another . When the War Department recedes from an announced position he is prepared to submit some equally debatable issue . While many of these issues are small in themselves , the cumulative effect is being felt throughout the War Department among those who deal with Negro problems . Incident after incident could be recounted wherein he has demonstrated willful persistence in breaking down the Department 's long considered policies . " Going from one disputed point to another , adapting the language and bureaucratic techniques of his adversaries for his own purposes , Hastie made it impossible for the War Department to evade the implications of its " long-considered " Jim Crow policies . On September 22 , 1941 , after ten months of " observation , discussion , and action in the War Department and in the field , " he issued the Hastie Survey , which was an " overall description of what is happening to the Negro in the Army . " What was happening , he said , was blatant racism reminiscent of the Nazi creed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , William H. Hastie ( far left ) , civilian aide to the secretary of war confers with Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson . War Department bureaucracy was hostile to the new appointee , who resigned in 1943 with a public blast against racism in the Air Forces , which assigned Blacks to segregated units and discriminated against Black pilots and technicians . // " The traditional mores of the South , " he wrote , " have been widely accepted and adopted by the Army as the basis of policy and practice affecting the Negro soldiers ... In tactical organization , in physical location , in human contacts , the Negro soldier is separated from the white soldier as completely as possible . " This , he said , was inefficient , expensive and a violation of the stated war aims . " Insistence upon an inflexible policy of separating white and black soldiers , " he added , " is probably the most dramatic evidence of hypocrisy in our profession that we are girding ourselves for the preservation of democracy . " To change this situation , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive integration " of Black soldiers . " All of this , " he concluded , " will not be changed overnight . The disturbing thing , however , is that there is no apparent disposition to make a beginning or a trial of any different plan . " The disturbing thing to the War Department was that there was a man in the War Department who dared to speak with such frankness and eloquence . Charging that Hastie was promoting a social revolution , War Department leaders said the Army was not " a sociological laboratory . " Thus , in the fall and winter of 1941 , Judge Hastie and the War Department came to a point of stalemate . A further complication was introduced by Army and Air Force officials who began organizing a flanking movement which was designated to isolate Hastie and his White supporters . Throughout this period and on into 1942 , memorandums were circulated in the War Department with notations that said , in effect , " Not To Be Shown to Judge Hastie . " This campaign climaxed with the organization , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Negro Troop Policies . When Hastie learned through the grapevine that a committee had been formed to coordinate all matters relating to the use of Negro troops , he exploded and offered his resignation to Undersecretary Robert P. Patterson . Patterson persuaded Hastie to remain and arranged a meeting with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson . The two men met in October 1942 , and organized a truce , but it was clear to both of them that they were approaching a point of no return . The business came to a head in the last months of 1942 over the policy of the U.S. Army Air Forces , which had persistently and insultingly violated the Hastie mandate . In the fall of 1942 , Hastie repeatedly questioned the Air Forces about these violations , citing segregation of dining and toilet facilities at Tuskegee Army Air Field and discriminatory Air Forces policies on officer candidates , flight surgeons and meteorologists . When , in late November , he learned from St. Louis newspapers that the Air Force was planning a segregated officer candidate school at Jefferson Barracks , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied evasively that there were no " present ... plans " for a Jim Crow post at Jefferson Barracks . This reply was dated December 17 . Fifteen days later , on January 1 , 1943 , an Army press release informed Hastie and the world that a Black officer candidate school would open at Jefferson Barracks on January 15 . On Tuesday , January 5  --  without prior consultation with either friends or advisors  --  Hastie told Secretary Stimson and Undersecretary Patterson that " further retrogression is now so apparent in the Air Force and recent occurrences are so objectionable and inexcusable that I have no alternative but to resign in protest and to give public expression to my views . " He was particularly critical of Air Force policies . Photograph Three years after resignation , in 1946 , Hastie became the first Black governor of the Virgin Islands . Appointment surprised observers who believed that he had wrecked his personal career by his resignation from the War Department . He received Spingarn Medal for his act of courage . // " In establishing a separate Officer Candidate School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejecting the general practice of unsegregated Officer Candidate Schools which has proved so eminently successful throughout the Army and which has been so hopeful an augury . I did not know that such a school was contemplated until the matter appeared a few days ago in an Army press release . Worse , still , I was given misleading information by the Air Forces at a time when the plan must have been well advanced ... In such circumstances the failure of the Air Forces , after written request , to advise this office candidly and fully of a plan so soon to be publicly announced can not be considered an excusable inadvertence . " When the resignation became effective on January 31 , Hastie went public with a series of articles that denounced the " reactionary policies and discriminatory practices " of the Air Force . A headline in the Chicago Defender said : " HASTIE RIPS LILY-WHITE " AIR CORPS IN FIERY EXIT . " Hastie 's detailed charges against the Air Force were collected and published in a famous 1943 pamphlet , " On Clipped Wings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucius Harper , writing in the Chicago Defender , expressed the general view , saying : " We need more resignations in high places to move forward . " The same view , in different words , was expressed by the NAACP , which gave Hastie the Spingarn Medal for " the most outstanding contribution " by a Black American in 1943 . Praises and awards apart , the resignation had immediate and tangible results . The Air Force began belatedly to face racial reality , modifying racial segregation at Tuskegee Army Air Field and canceling plans for a separate officer candidate school . General George E. Stratemeyer , chief of the Air Staff , went further , telling subordinates : " I do n't want any colored school any place to be conducted as a segregated school . With reference to colored Officer Candidates at Miami Beach , I want them treated just like white Officer Candidates . They will go to the same classes , to the same drills , and eat in mess halls the same as the whites ... " There were also changes in the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner honoring Judge Hastie , Secretary of War Patterson said that the Army 's success in mobilizing Black man  --  power in World War II was due largely to the work of the former civilian aide . After the shouting and cheering died down , Hastie returned to the Howard University Law School , where he played a major role in designing the successful NAACP legal campaign . Asked once if it required a great deal of courage to give up his government post , Hastie said no , because his university job was waiting for him and " because I was n't faced with hunger . " Although almost everyone praised his courage , most informed observers said privately that he had advanced the cause and destroyed his career . The general feeling , even among his friends , was that he would never again hold a major government position . But later events proved that it is risky business to doubt the dynamizing power of an act of conscience . Three years later , in 1946 , Hastie , sponsored again by his old friend Harold Ickes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three years later , he was named the first Black on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . When , on April 14 , 1976 , he died , full of years and honors , and with a clear conscience , commentators recalled his spectacular act of defiance and quoted the verse he used at the time to explain his act and to summon others to the same height : He either fears his fate too much Or his deserts are small That dares not put it to the touch To win or lose it all . Photograph Despite militant stand . Hastie was named first Black judge on the U.S. Circuit of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit . He became chief judge of the court in 1968 and retired in 1971 . He died of a heat attack in 1976. // <p>
