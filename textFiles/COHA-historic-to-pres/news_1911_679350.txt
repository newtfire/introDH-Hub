Charles H. Hyde , New York City 's missing Chamberlain , boarded a train in this city for home this evening . He has decided to return and straighten out matters . Just as he was leaving town Mr. Hyde made a statement to THE TIMES correspondent . It is the first he has made since his disappearance . Regarding his absence from New York during the recent bank failures and the hearings before the Legislative Committee , which was investigating the race track gambling fund , and which wanted him as a witness , Mr. Hyde said : " I have not been well for some time , and was advised to take a complete rest . There was not the slighcst indication of bank troubles when I left New York , and I had not heard of recent occurrences until Dan Smith , my secretary 's brother , overtook me on my houseboat en route to Palm Beach . As soon as I learned of the failures I left the boat at the head of the Halifax River , near Daytona , and am now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything now , as I understand that charges have Veen preferred against me , and I must deal with them officially . " Mr. Hyde remarked he supposed that , anyway , there would be little profit In entering into a controversy with " people who always rise to attack me when my back is turned . " Asked about the race track fund allegations , he said : " Oh , that was so utterly false and unfounded that I never bothered about it . I did n't even know the people with whom I was supposed to have dined . I did not subscribe to any such fund for a client or any one else , and every newspaper man at Albany knew the rest of it was untrue . 1 am quite sure that Senator Gardner never told such a falsehood . " Dan Smith , brother of the Chamberlain 's secretary , who is accompanying the Chamberlain , to New York , said : " I left New York this week at the request of my brother in an effort to locate Me . Hyde to inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no address . and it was with great difficulty that I succeeded in locating him after a week 's ? search . Finally I found his houseboat . on the canal leading into the Halifax River just above Ormond . " Mr. Hyde was greatly surprised to hear of all that had been going on , and It was not until I mentioned the bank failures that he permitted me to show him a newspaper . He said that reporters and detectives had followed him everywhere he had been since the Mayoralty campaign , even trailing him all over Europe , and that he wanted to be free of mind and body . " many times he had thought of resigning his public office , and had told his friends that this continual shadowing had been a nuisance to his family . as well as to himself . He said they had even entered his law office and rummaged through his papers , taking letters and other documents  --  just what for he did not know . " When - the situation was fully explained : Mr. 111-de decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laughingly remarked : " ' I do n't suppose I could have prevented the failures or that I can reopen the banks Those who have their own ends to serve and the financial power must decide these questions ,
