Executives in the information-services business are in a tizzy about a proposal by the Federal Communications Commission that would make it much more expensive to send and receive electronic data over telephone lines . More than 1.7 million household and business customers with computers subscribe to about 3,000 electronic-informati on services , which furnish everything from stock- price quotes to job listings . The information passes from the phone line to the computer through a connective device called a modem . These services are carried by data networks , which under the FCC plan would have to pay $4 to $5 an hour per user to local phone companies for the right to transmit and receive material over their lines . The fees would be passed on to customers and could roughly double current usage charges . <P> Executives say the access fee would be a heavy blow to a still young industry . Customers are not happy either . Last week computer buffs were already flashing electronic messages to one another in an effort to organize a " modem march " on Washington .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
