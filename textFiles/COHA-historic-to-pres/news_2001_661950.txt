Text of President Bush 's speech at Notre Dame University 's commencement ceremony Sunday , as transcribed by eMediaMillWorks , Inc . <p> BUSH : Thank you all . Thank you very much . Thank you . Please be seated . <p> Thank you , Father Malloy ( ph ) , and thank you all for that warm welcome , Chairman McArtin ( ph ) , Father Scully ( ph ) , Dr. Hatch ( ph ) , Notre Dame trustees , members of the class of 2001 . <p> It is a high privilege to receive this degree . I 'm particularly pleased that it bears the great name of Notre Dame . My brother , Jed , may be the Catholic in the family , but between us , I 'm the only Domer . <p> I have spoken on this campus before . It was in 1980 , the year my dad ran for vice president with Ronald Reagan . I think I really won over the crowd that day . <p> In fact , I 'm sure of it because all six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back when Father Hesburg ( ph ) was the president of this university during a tenure that in many ways defined the reputation and values of Notre Dame . And it 's a real honor to be here with Father Hesburg ( ph ) and with Father Joyce ( ph ) . Between them , these two good priests have given nearly a century of service to Notre Dame . I 'm told that Father Hesburg ( ph ) now holds 146 honorary degrees . <p> That 's pretty darn impressive , Father , but I 'm gaining on you . <p> As of today , I 'm only a 140 behind . <p> Let me congratulate all the members of the class of 2001 . <p> You made it , and we 're all proud of you on this big day . <p> I also congratulate the parents who after these years are happy , proud and broke . <p> I commend this fine faculty for the years of work and instruction that produced this outstanding class . <p> And I 'm pleased to join my fellow honorees as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives , educators , church officials and eminent scientists . <p> We 're sharing a memorable day and a great honor , and I congratulate you all . <p> Notre Dame , as a Catholic university , carries forward a great tradition of social teaching . It calls on all of us , Catholic and non-Catholic , to honor family , to protect life in all its stages , to serve and uplift the poor . <p> This university is more than a community of scholars . It is a community of conscience and an ideal place to report on our nation 's commitment to the poor and how we 're keeping it . <p> In 1964 , the year I started college , another president from Texas delivered a commencement address talking about this national commitment . In that speech , President Lyndon Johnson issued a challenge . He said : This is a time for decision . You are the generation which must decide . Will you decide to leave the future a society where a man is condemned to hopelessness because he was born poor ? Or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In that speech , Lyndon Johnson advocated a war on poverty which had noble intentions and some enduring successes . Poor families got basic health care . Disadvantaged children were given a head start in life . <p> Yet , there were also some consequences that no one wanted or intended . The welfare entitlement became an enemy of personal effort and responsibility , turning many recipients into dependents . <p> The war on poverty also turned too many citizens into bystanders convinced that compassion had become the work of government alone . <p> In 1996 , welfare reform confronted the first of these problems with a five-year time limit on benefits and a work requirement to receive them . Instead of a way of life , welfare became an offer of temporary help , not an entitlement but a transition . Thanks in large part to this change , welfare rolls have been cut in half . Work and self respect have been returned to many lives . This is a tribute to Democrats and Republicans who agreed on reform and to the president who signed it , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but our work is only half done . Now we must confront the second problem  --  to revive the spirit of citizenship , to marshal the compassion of our people to meet the continuing needs of our nation . This is a challenge to my administration and each one of you . <p> We must meet that challenge because it is right and because it is urgent . <p> Welfare as we knew it has ended but poverty has not . When over 12 million children live below the poverty line , we are not a post-poverty America . Most states are seeing the first wave of welfare recipients who have reached the law 's five-year time limit . The easy cases have already left the welfare roles . <p> The hardest problems remain : People with far fewer skills and greater barriers to work . People with complex human problems like illiteracy and addiction , abuse and mental illness . We do not yet know what will happen to these men and women or to their children . But we can not sit and watch , leaving them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great deal at stake . In our attitudes and our actions we are determining the character of our country . When poverty is considered hopeless , America is condemned to permanent social division , becoming a nation of caste and class , divided by fences and gates and guards . <p> Our task is clear , and it 's difficult . We must build our country 's unity by extending our country 's blessings . We make that commitment because we 're Americans . Aspiration is the essence of our country . We believe in social mobility , not social Darwinism . We are the country of the second chance where failure is never final . And that dream has sometimes been deferred . It must never be abandoned . <p> BUSH : The hope we seek is found in safe havens for battered women and children in homeless shelters and crisis pregnancy centers , in programs that tutor and conduct job training and help young people who may happen to be on parole . <p> All these efforts provide not just the benefit but attention and kindness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mother Teresa said that what the poor often need , even more than shelter and food , though these are desperately needed as well , is to be wanted . And that sense of belonging is within the power of each of us to provide . <p> Many in this community have shown what compassion can accomplish . Notre Dame 's own Lou Nanny ( ph ) is the former director of South Bend Center for the Homeless , an institution founded by two Notre Dame professors . It provides guests with everything from drug treatment to mental health services to classes in the great books to pre-school for young children . <p> Discipline is tough . Faith is encouraged , not required . Student volunteers are committed and consistent and central to its mission . <p> Lou Nanny ( ph ) describes its mission as repairing the fabric of society by letting people see the inherent worth and dignity and God-given potential of every human being . <p> Compassion often works best on a small and human scale . It is generally better when a call for help is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've heard that call and responded . It is part of what makes Notre Dame a great university . <p> This is my message today . There is no great society which is not a caring society , and any effective war on poverty must deploy what Dorothy Day called the weapons of spirit . There 's only one problem with groups like South Bend Center for the Homeless : They 're are n't enough of them . <p> It 's not sufficient to praise charities and community groups . We must support them , and this is both a public obligation and a personal responsibility . <p> The war on poverty established a federal commitment to the poor . The welfare reform legislation of 1996 made that commitment more effective . For the task ahead , we must move to the third stage of combating poverty in America . Our society must enlist , equip and empower idealistic Americans in the works of compassion that only they can provide . <p> Government has an important role . We will never be replaced by charities . My administration increases funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet government must also do more to take the side of charities and community healers and support their work . <p> We 've had enough of the stale debate between big government and indifferent government . <p> Government must be active enough to fund services for the poor and humble enough to let good people in local communities provide those services . <p> So , I 've created a White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives . <p> Through that office we are working to ensure that local community helpers and healers receive more federal dollars , greater private support and face fewer bureaucratic barriers . We have proposed a compassion capital fund that will match private giving with federal dollars . <p> We have proposed allowing all taxpayers to deduct their charitable contributions , including non-itemizers . <p> This could encourage almost $ 15 billion a year in new charitable giving . <p> My attitude is , everyone in America , whether they are well off or not , should have the same incentive and reward for giving . <p> And we 're in the process of implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal law that faith-based organizations should not suffer discrimination when they compete for contracts to provide social services . <p> Government should never fund the teaching of faith , but it should support the good works of the faithful . <p> Some critics of this approach object to the idea of government funding going to any group motivated by faith . But they should take a look around them . Public money already goes to groups like The Center for the Homeless and , on a larger scale , to Catholic Charities . Do the critics really want to cut them off ? Medicaid and Medicare money currently goes to religious hospitals . Should this practice be ended ? Child care vouchers for low-income families are redeemed every day at houses of worship across America . Should this be prevented ? Government loans send countless students to religious colleges . Should this be banned ? Of course not . <p> America has a long tradition of accommodating and encouraging religious institutions when they pursue public goals . <p> My administration did not create that tradition , but we will expand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding two initiates to our agenda in the areas of housing and drug treatment . Owning a home is a source of dignity for families and stability for communities . And organizations like Habitat for Humanity make that dream possible for many low-income Americans . <p> Groups of this type currently receive some funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development . The budget I submit to Congress next year will propose a three-fold increase in this funding , which will expand home ownership and the hope and pride that come with it . <p> And nothing is more likely to perpetuate poverty than a life enslaved to drugs . So we propose $ 1.6 billion in new funds to close what I call the treatment gap  --  the gap between the 5 million Americans who need drug treatment and the 2 million who currently receive it . <p> We will also propose that all these funds , all of them , be open to equal competition from faith-based and community groups . <p> BUSH : The federal government should do all these things , but others have responsibilities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do good work and good causes , but if we hope to substantially reduce poverty and suffering in our country , corporate America needs to give more and to give better . <p> Faith-based organizations receive only a tiny percentage of overall corporate giving . Currently six of the 10 largest corporate givers in America explicitly rule out or restrict donations to faith-based groups regardless of their effectiveness . <p> The federal government will not discriminate against faith-based organizations and neither should corporate America . <p> In the same spirit , I hope America 's foundations consider ways they may devote more of their money to our nation 's neighborhood and their helpers and their healers . I will convene a summit this fall asking corporate and philanthropic leaders throughout America to join me at the White House to discuss ways they can provide more support to community organizations , both secular and religious . <p> Ultimately , your country is counting on each of you . Knute Rockne once said , " I have found that prayers work best when you have big players . " <p> We can pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big players we need to achieve it . Government can promote compassion . Corporations and foundations can fund it , but the citizens - it 's the citizens who provide it . <p> A determined assault on poverty will require both an active government and active citizens . There 's more to citizenship than voting , though I urge you to do it . There 's more to citizenship than paying your taxes , though I 'd strongly advise you pay them . <p> Citizenship is empty without concern for our fellow citizens , without the ties that bind us to one another and build a common good . If you already realize this and you 're acting on it , I thank you . <p> If you have n't thought about it , I leave you with this challenge : Serve a neighbor in need , because a life of service is a life of significance . <p> Because materialism ultimately is boring , and consumerism can build a prison of loss . Because a person who is not responsible for others is a person who is truly alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for America than to care for other Americans . And because the same God who endows us with individual rights also calls us to social obligations . <p> So let me return to Lyndon Johnson 's charge : You 're the generation that must decide . Will you ratify poverty and division with your apathy ? Or will you build a common good with your idealism ? Will you be a spectator in the renewal of your country , or a citizen ? <p> The methods of the past may have been flawed , but the idealism of the past was not an illusion . Your calling is not easy , because you must do the acting and the caring . But there is fulfillment in that sacrifice which creates hope for the rest of us . Every life you help proves that every life might be helped . The actual proves the possible , and hope is always the beginning of change . <p> Thank you for having me , and God bless .
