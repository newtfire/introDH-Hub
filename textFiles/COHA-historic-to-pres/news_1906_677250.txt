What was Universally agreed among Senators of both sides to be one of the greatest speeches delivered in the Senate for many years was made to-day by Mr. Bailey Of Texas . Not even the Senators who disagreed with it in principle failed to pay tribute to its greatness as a speech and a legal argument . Practically the whole House of Representatives deserted their own chamber and came over to stand up in the Senate . General admission to the Senate galleries was virtually suspended , and admission was by card . While Bailey was still speaking , and about half an hour before the conclusion , Senator Hale of Maine rose on the Republican side and expressed his admiration for the character of the argument to which the Senate was listening . He declared that Bailey had proved his case as to the power of Congress to control all Federal courts except the Supreme Court He predicted that the Senate was about to agree on a Rate bill , and declared that Bailey 's speech nad " largely contributed to that near and beneficent result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for he declared in favor of having the Inter-State Commerce Commission 's decision stand until it was overturned by the Supreme Court . Aldrich , who was the picture of clisn.ay , pulled his coattail and hissed ! " You mean the Circuit Court . " " I mean the . Supreme Court , " replied Hale , taming to Aldrich and raising his voice . Bailey 's argument was a strictly legal one designed to show that Congress had full power to abridge the right of the courts to ist is restraining orders . The first part cf tile sceech was in answer to the speeches delivered by Messrs . Kncx and ** Ile took the authorities el:0d by both and dissected thorn . He produced the Supreme Court reports and read to the afnate the langul.je which convicted both of having misled the Senate as to the law . From these decisions he convicted Senator Spooner of having read dissenting opinions as if they were opinions of the court , of having read an obiter dictum , or " essay " as Bailey called it , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court ; of shppress ! ng parts of decisions V:h ! ch contradicted or qualified the parts he read ; c- saying that t ere was no dissent from a decision when it was specifKelly dissented from in opinions which Dailey read ; of reading a dissenting opin ; an by Story as if it were the actual deesion , which was made by Marshall ; of reading dissenting opinions as such and not reading the part in which the dissenting Justice conceded the essential correctness of the majority opinion on the point at issue . He spent an hour on this pulverization of Spooner and then turned to Knox , un whom he spent another hour . He proved that Knox had taken his authorities from textbooks wherein the writers bared what they said on the law as it was and not on what Congress could do with it . Spooner sat throughout this speech looking thoroughly unhappy . Usually he is lively and alert with interruptions , and smiles at every good point . He never took his eyes from Bailey 's face , never spoke . and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knox was able to conceal any chagrin he may have felt . He laughed at Bailey 's witticisms . Spooner never smiled . At the close of Bailey 's speech the galleries , in utter defiance of the rules , broke into prolonged applause . The Vice President , as in duty bound , tapped mildly with his gavel , but did not indulge in the usual resounding bang and warning that the outrage must not be repeated under pain of clearing the galleries . There was a rush from all parts of the Chamber to congratulate Mr. Bailey . The Democratic Senators pressed around . Senator Teller stood in tears until the rush had subsided somewhat so he could offer his covg-ratulations . The Republican Senators came over in a long line , Foraker ' heading the procession . Senator Spooner remained in his seat , but Senator Knox was among the first to tender his congratulations . POWER OF THE JUDICIARY . ? " The time was never so unfortunate as now for the revival of the doctrine of arbitrary Hower on the part of the courts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pooner 's speech . He spoke of the division of authority among the various branches of the Government , but said that he could not follow those tztieringt of recant years which seem to paceeed on the theory that there shoeld be no restrictions upon the judiciary . " This , ' he said , " Is the first Government that ever conferred upon the iadiciary the power to annul legislation . ( Iod knows that ought to be enough power to confer upon any nine men ; we are ninety ; they are nine . I would not trench upon their power : I would hold myself unworthy if I permitted them to encroach upon mine . " Ref erring to Mr. Knox 's quotations from the textbooks on jurisprudence , he said that " The Senator forgets that they were discussing the law as it is , and that it is as it is because Congress wills it so , " the point being that the legislative branch of the Government is supreme in the law-making and courts-regulating function . " Happily , the Senator from Penney ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says Congress can say when , but not how , the judicial power shall speak , " Mr. Bailey continued , and then said he was willing to accept that view . He did not want the courts to de &de; a question until they were able to decide it right . " Does the Senator agree to that1 " he asked , and he replied to the question himself by saying that Mr. // BAILEY ROUTS SPOONER AND KNOX ON RATE BILL // Znox 's own speech gave sufficient evidence of his position . He declared that both Mr. Knox - and Mr. Spooner had misconceived the theory under which Congress establishes the inferior courts , saying that if so disposed Congress could to-day disestablish every one of the inferior courts . He did not agree with Mr. Spooner that such a course would be anarchy , because the State courts would- be left . Congress might , he argued , declare war against every nation of the globe , and while there was no doubt that the people would scourge the Congress that wquld do so , still there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So it was with the right of Congress regarding the courts . THE POWER . TO LIMIT . " The power to create and'the power to destroy must include  --  the ? power to limit . The Senator from South Carolina has been pressing this point as a cornfield lawyer , " he said , and the constitutional lawyers have never yet been able to satisfactorily answer his contention . " In support of the plea that the legislative authority is not curtailed he called attention to the fact that with reference to the inferior courts no limitation is put upon Congress as to their , ribmber , their jurisdiction , or their power . Along with decisions by the courts . he quoted the text writer ConklIng as saying that " the Circuit Courts possess no power not conferred by Congress , " and when Mr. Spooner evinced an interest in the book , Mr. Bailey remarked : " He wrote and lived before the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Pennsylvania delivered their remarkable speeches . " He quoted a case decided by Chief Justice Marshall , involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he said that the courts can not issue a writ of habeas corpus except upon the authority of a written law . ' And yet , " he said , " the Senators tell us that Congress has no power to put a limitation on the in , junction power of the courts . " As a matter of practical convenience , a railroad company could better afford to sue 10,000 shippers for the difference in rate in case of a final decree favorable to it than 10,000 shippers could afford to sue the company . He asserted that in more than ? one decision the Supreme Court had held that the inferior courts have no " inherent function , " as contended by Mr. Knox . Ile quoted an opinion in which was made the statement that Congress had withheld Jurisdiction . " How , in the name of common sense , can Congress withhold from a court jurisdiction of a subject and not withhold judicial power ? " he asked , to further support his contention that the phrase " judicial power " and the word " jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONGRESS . " If , " he said , " the President is commanded by a statute to perform a certain duty he does not consider the authority is given directly by the Constitution . The Constitution is the-source of all power , but it is a dead letter unless Congress breathes into it the breath of life . He declared that even the courts have no power to execute their own judgments without specific authority from Con-ress , g and quoted the case of Fink vs . O'Neil in support of the contention . Mr. Bailey disavowed that he had any intention of attacking the courts , but he said that he had himself known some courts that were guilty of abuses ; . hence it was necessary to place limitations upon all of them . Moreover , the manifold duties of the Judges . would prevent their giving the careful attention necessary to railroad questions . He ' contended that commissioners could be found as competent as the Judges of the courts . " And , " he added , " if we can not get commissioners equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic ! Coming then to the consideration of Mr. Hale 's question relative to the final decision of railroad cases by the Supreme Court of the United States , Mr. Bailey said that he did not believe ? that the courts were the best tribunal for the settlement of those questions , but that under the Constitution he did not believe that the right to such adjudication could be denied the carrier . " If , " he went on , " a railroad can take my property upon paying me what the court says is right , why ca n't you permit me to take the property of the railroad company and hold it until it is finally decided ? " This , he added . may be regarded as elementary in the Senate ; it will be so accepted by the plain people , Who have a ' right to demand their voice shall have respectful consideration . ? ' He expressed his regret that he had not been . able to agree with Messrs . Knox and Spooner . " They have , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or announced in the courts in their effort to draw a distinction between jurisdiction and judicial power . They could get a patent on it for its novelty , but it would be denied for its lack of value . " He had no apprehension concerning the effect of the-proposed legislation . Instead of undesirable results he was of opinion that the railroads would be forced by it to do justice . " Then , " he said , ' we would hear no more of railroad Senators and railroad influence in politics , and I for one would be delighted to have the railroads entirely eliminated from the public affairs of the country .
