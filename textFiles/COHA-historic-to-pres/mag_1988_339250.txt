Confiscated in a drug raid on Maui , Hawaii , three years ago , the handmade map with hieroglyphic scrawls looked like something out of Treasure Island . Once Drug Enforcement Administration agents deciphered it , however , the map and subsequent tips led to treasures beyond the dreams of Long John Silver . Investigators turned up 982 rare gold coins buried in hard-to-reach holes from Hawaii to Colorado . Officials expect the coins to bring $2 million or more in auctions that begin next week in Long Beach , Calif . <P> The most valuable discovery : a 1933 $10 eagle gold piece now worth $80,000 or more . The map , said the DEA last week , turned up in the home of a wind- surfing drug merchant known as " Colorado Bill " and " King Midas . " Bill ( the DEA is withholding his full name ) can follow the auction from his cell in Lompoc , Calif. , where he is doing 17 years for drug trafficking .               @ @ @ @ @ @
