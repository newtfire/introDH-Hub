Like many another U.S. businessman , Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. ' s Chairman Paul W. Litchfield was eager to start producing in Europe 's prized hard-currency markets . The Netherlands was out of the question , since Litchfield 's arch rival , Goodrich , already had a plant there . So was Belgium , which has two tire plants of its own . With the doleful expression of a jilted suitor , Rubberman Litchfield turned his eyes to the tiny ( pop . 300,000 ) Grand Duchy of Luxembourg . <P> Since liberation , Luxembourg 's sturdy little economy-closely linked with Belgium and The Netherlands-had bounced back faster than many of its bigger neighbors . Its man-hour productivity was one of the highest on the continent ( citizens could hardly remember the last bad strike ) ; its currency , like Belgium 's , was freely convertible into dollars . Because trade barriers in the Benelux nations are being broken down , Goodyear could produce in Luxembourg and still sell in Belgium and The Netherlands . The job was to convince Luxembourg that it needed a U.S.-owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments . Goodyear , they said , was after no new markets ; it simply wanted to sell tires in Europe for local currencies instead of dollars-and thus help conserve scarce continental dollars . Furthermore , they argued , a Goodyear plant would be healthy for the Benelux economy , giving a new source of employment . And local revenues would increase still further when Goodyear 's plant started buying such Benelux raw materials as rubber from the Belgian Congo and the former Netherlands East Indies , and rayon and cotton cord from Belgium and The Netherlands . Another potent argument was the undisclosed sum Goodyear offered for a 45-acre site 18 miles north of Luxembourg City , the duchy 's capital . The land belonged to Grand Duchess Charlotte herself . Last fall she agreed to sell . <P> In Akron last week , Chairman Litchfield announced that work had begun on a $5,000,000 tire factory on the duchess ' old land . When finished , it will turn out some 600 tires a day , provide jobs for 500 Luxembourg workers .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
