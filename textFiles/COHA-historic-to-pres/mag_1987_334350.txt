Even by the tongue-twisting standards of the Star Wars lexicon , the newcomer is something of a mouthful : space-based kinetic kill vehicles , or SBKKVs for short . Some scientists refer to them as " smart rocks , " since they are basically just projectiles designed to smack into enemy missiles . But they also have the potential of smacking into and perhaps even destroying the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty . It is the alleged " stunning success " of smart-rock experiments , rather than any progress on the laser and particle- beam zappers usually associated with Star Wars , that has prompted Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to argue that " we are closer to being able to recommend deployment decisions . " <P> The problem is that the ABM treaty , as currently applied , prohibits testing or deploying antimissile systems in space . Weinberger has been leading the fight within the Administration for a " broader " interpretation of the treaty , which emphasizes an appendage that may allow the development of systems based on " physical principles " that were unknown when the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " legally correct , " but Secretary of State George Shultz has so far been able to prevent the Administration from abandoning the more restrictive reading that has been in force for 15 years . <P> Reagan last week agreed to hold off making any changes in applying the treaty until he has consulted with Congress and NATO allies , a process that could take months . Meanwhile , the debate raises scientific questions that may turn out to be more important than nuances of treaty interpretations . Among the most critical : How feasible is the type of system that Weinberger says will soon be ready for testing and deployment ? <P> According to advocates of an SDI speedup , it might be possible in the mid- 1990s to orbit a space-based system of hundreds of satellites , called " garages , " each capable of launching a dozen or so smart rocks that could strike Soviet missiles as they are launched . The system would also include ground-based smart rocks capable of striking warheads as they re-enter the atmosphere . Gerold Yonas , until recently the chief SDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort would run over $100 billion . " By contrast , a full-fledged Star Wars system involving lasers and other futuristic technology could cost $1 trillion or more and would not be ready until early in the next century . <P> Supporters of what has come to be called " phased deployment "  --  meaning putting in place a simple system of smart rocks as a prelude to a more advanced system  --  base their optimism on the success of last year 's Delta 180 demonstration ; in this experiment , a space vehicle launched on a Delta rocket tracked and targeted another rocket and then maneuvered to collide with a satellite . The demonstration , however , was somewhat rigged : the rocket orbits were preprogrammed , and a reflector on the target rocket magnified its image 1,000 times . Nevertheless , Air Force Lieut . General James Abrahamson , SDI 's director , argues that the $150 million demonstration proved it is feasible for a smart rock to locate a missile shrouded in its own exhaust plume and track other objects in space . Although he says Delta 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the broad interpretation is necessary to conduct the next such test , known as Delta 181.
