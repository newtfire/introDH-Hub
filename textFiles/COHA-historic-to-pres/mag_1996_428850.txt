RADIO TELESCOPES for the microwave region have been largely beyond the reach of amateurs and teachers , owing to the high cost of a large collecting area . Now , however , some interesting astronomy can be done with the widely available dishes designed for satellite TV reception . Our Small Radio Telescope ( SRT ) here at Haystack Observatory grew from a suggestion by Irwin Shapiro , director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics . It takes advantage of the very sensitive electronics mounted at the focus of today 's satellite dishes . When combined with the processing ability of a personal computer , our 9-foot dish can serve as a simple but effective radio telescope . NOISE TEMPERATURE The terms used by radio astronomers are a little different from the jargon of satellite TV . What we call the " front end " - the electronics mounted on the dish itself - is the same as the LNB ( low-noise block ) converter that you can buy from Radio Shack or a TV shopping service . Similarly , the satellite receiver when used for astronomy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio emission , normally expressed in Kelvin units A Kelvin value is equal to degrees Celsius plus 273 , so that absolute zero , or 0deg K , is the same as - 273deg C. The LNB is connected through a waveguide to the antenna feed , and both are mounted at the focus of the dish . If you detach these components and point the feed toward the ground on a summer day , a signal-power detector will show an equivalent temperature of about 325deg K. Typically 25deg is due to noise within the LNB , assuming it is a modern one , and 300deg is from the ground itself ( 300deg K being 27deg C , or 81deg Fahrenheit ) . Put your hand in front of the feed , and the power will increase again . Your hand and the ground both radiate radio waves with an equivalent temperature that is roughly equal to their absolute physical temperature . Photograph Alan E. E.

Of this 25deg still comes from the LNB , but 5deg is from the Earth 's atmosphere , and 3deg is from the cosmic background remnant of the Big Bang . The remainder is a stray contribution from the ground , because the " sidelobes " of the feed 's response still fall on the ground even though you point the feed straight up . When the feed is remounted at the focus of the dish , the ground contribution goes down and the input signal becomes much more directional . Extracting scientific data , after accounting for all the contributions to the signal , is what radio astronomy is all about . SATELLITE TV BANDS Satellite TV is broadcast from geosynchronously orbiting satellites , and they appear stationary in the sky . As such they are handy reference points for checking the aim of a radio telescope . The frequency ranges used by satellite TV are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequencies from 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz , corresponding to wavelengths between 8.1 and 7.1 centimeters . When a satellite dish is used in the C band , the angular resolution or beam-width is approximately 2deg on the celestial sphere . By going to the Ku band , which has a frequency of about 12 GHz and a wavelength of 2.5 cm , we can improve the resolution by a factor of three . But there are serious tradeoffs . The LNBs sold for the Ku band are less sensitive , and this combined with the finer resolution makes the dish harder to point . A better choice for a satellite-dish radio telescope is the L band , with the receiver centered on the 1420.4-megahertz frequency of hydrogen emission ( wavelength 21 cm ) . The beam at this frequency is about 5deg wide , so pointing requirements are relaxed . This hydrogen emission is widespread around the sky and relatively strong , as shown in the map below . Later in this article I 'll explain further how it was prepared . All three of these frequency bands are above 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ionosphere has very little effect on microwaves , day or night , they are well suited for both line-ofsight satellite transmissions and radio astronomy . THE MICROWAVE SKY At 4 GHz the Sun is by far the strongest radio emitter in the sky . Its emission is largely thermal , and if the Sun were large enough to completely fill the beam of the 9-foot dish the noise output from the receiver would increase by more than 6,000deg K. However , since the Sun fills only about 1/60 of this beam area , we might expect to receive only about 100deg K. In fact , the signal received from the Sun is more than 100deg and somewhat variable , owing to nonthermal emission associated with sunspots or active regions . // The author 's all-sky radio map ( left ) , compiled at a wavelength of 21 centimeters , offers a perspective on our galaxy 's dynamics that the human eye ca n't perceive directly .

Compare it to the visiblelight map ( below ) created at Lund Observatory , Sweden , in 1957 . Both are equal-area projections using galactic coordinates . The radio map lacks data in the south-circumpolar sky inaccessible from Massachusetts ; note the Magellanic Clouds in this part of the Lund chart . // So here is our first surprise  --  sunspots are actually brighter than the surrounding disk at microwave frequencies , even though they are darker in visible light . The Sun sends a strong enough signal that it can spoil TV reception of a football game for a short period each day when it lines up with the satellite being used by your own dish or the local cable company . In the Boston area , this happens when the Sun 's declination is close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of October , and again in early March . The Sun adds " snow " to the signal , because the radio noise from the Sun is random . So the Sun is a good source on which to check out the system , measure the beam size , and practice pointing . To prepare for the drift scan of the Sun illustrated at right , we moved the antenna until the feed 's shadow coincided with the dish center and then advanced the dish to anticipate the Sun 's motion across the sky . Such a scan can also be done on a cloudy day . Simply manipulate the dish to find the Sun as a spike in the receiver output , and then nudge the antenna a few degrees to the west . Next to the Sun , the Moon is the strongest radio emitter . In this case the emission is entirely thermal . The brightness temperature is about 200deg K , which is close to the physical temperature of the Moon 's surface about one wavelength deep in the lunar dust . Without a good , stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is only a fraction of the system temperature ( the combined noise from the LNB and the dish ) . But with proper electronics the Moon provides a healthy signal that is excellent for calibration purposes . For example , if you wish to monitor the Sun 's variability , you will need an independent calibrator like the Moon at least once to determine your dish 's efficiency . This is defined as the fraction of radio energy intercepted by the dish that actually enters the LNB . Our satellite dish has a measured efficiency of about 50 percent . Other thermal radio sources , like the planets and stars , are extremely weak owing to severe dilution by the large beam . A small dish is apt to be more successful observing the extended emission from the plane of the Milky Way and large nebulae . Other potential targets are the strongest nonthermal radio sources , most of which are remnants of old supernovae like Cassiopeia A and the Crab Nebula . But all these sources are much weaker than the Moon . They require an interference-free environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enhance the sensitivity of the detector . For example , such a technique was used for our drift scan of the emission nebula M17 in Sagittarius . We made our Dicke switch by attaching a small rotating Yagi antenna in front of the feed , as shown above . The calculated difference between focused and defocused power is known as the switched power . It provides a much more stable radiometer than if we measured only the total power , which varies with drifts in the receiver electronics . OBSERVING HYDROGEN The individual hydrogen atoms in the interstellar medium radiate energy at precisely 1420.405 MHz . But these atoms are constantly in motion , and their frequencies are shifted by the Doppler effect . By measuring this shift at any given point in the sky , we can learn whether the interstellar gas in that direction is receding or approaching the Sun , and at what rate . The relative amount of hydrogen may also be calculated from the signal strength . As a result , much of what astronomers have deduced about the spiral arms and motions within our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With its cover removed , the author identifies components of the C-band feed for Roger Sinnott , including the auxiliary L-band probe .

The telescope itself is not driven ; the Earth 's rotation brings each object across the focus of the satellite dish , so the times at bottom can be converted later to angles on the sky . The approximate signal strengths are given in Kelvin units , after all extraneous contributions have been removed . // To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected a low-noise amplifier for the 21-cm wavelength to a probe in the outer cavity of our C-band feed pictured on page 77 . Then , using a tunable receiver , we swept the frequencies from 1419.7 to 1421.1 MHz to trace out the broadened profile of the 21-cm hydrogen emission line - in effect acquiring a spectrum by scanning the receiver . About 4,000 individual spectra of this type , obtained in the course of about one month , allowed us to create the allsky radio map on page 76 . Each day we parked the antenna at a different declination from - 30deg to +85deg in 5deg steps . That involved using the satellite-TV receiver to move the dish to a satellite at a known altitude and azimuth , then swiveling the dish manually ( with the help of a homemade setting circle ) to another azimuth corresponding to the desired declination . Every 24 hours the Earth 's rotation caused the beam to sweep a 5deg swath through the entire right-ascension range . The map was produced by saving all the spectra as disk files along with the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-processing step , the computer converted these coordinates to galactic latitude and longitude and found the frequency shift of each scanned bin . Finally it determined the velocity relative to the " local standard of rest " by removing the effects of the Earth 's rotational and orbital velocity as well as the Sun 's motion relative to other stars in the immediate solar neighborhood . Our map clearly shows the differential rotation of our galaxy . At galactic longitude 120deg , hydrogen gas that is mainly in the Perseus arm appears blue-shifted , indicating it is moving toward us . But at 240deg the gas is red-shifted , hence moving away . Most of the hydrogen is concentrated in the plane of the galaxy , just like the visible light of the Milky Way . Yet there is a spur of gas extending north of the plane at a galactic longitude of about 100 . Known as the North Polar Spur , this feature is thought to be a shell of gas from an ancient supernova explosion . Other extensions may also be seen , even though the hydrogen gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin layer . Away from the galactic center this layer becomes thicker and even warps above and below the galactic plane . The best example of this warp is the red-shifted emission near longitude 240deg , where it dips below the plane into southern latitudes . And all this from a backyard satellite dish ! For anyone interested in pursuing such experiments , Radio Shack sells a 9foot dish for about $1,300 , including an LNB converter and a feed horn . A lownoise amplifier for the 21-cm hydrogen line may be built or purchased for about $100 . These costs are not hard to justify if you are also interested in satellite TV . Most any personal computer can also be used , aided by a data acquisition card ( about $150 ) that plugs into an empty slot on the motherboard . For creating plots , histograms , and maps of the radio sky , commercial graphics software may also be used . That leaves just a single component that you must make yourself : the radiometer or " back end " of the telescope . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any serious enthusiast familiar with electronics and soldering techniques . We anticipate finding a company that can supply the back end , assembled or in kit form , for under $1,000 . We also plan to make the circuit diagram and instructions available through the Wide World Web ( http : **27;27;TOOLONG haystack.html ) . Alternatively , a power detector could be added to a commercial scanner receiver . Scanners that cover 1420 MHz and have the computer interface needed for data acquisition are now available for under $2,000 .
