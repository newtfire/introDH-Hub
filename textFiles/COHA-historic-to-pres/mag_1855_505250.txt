THE DOG , DESCRIBED AND ILLUSTRATED . IT would seem to be the beneficent order of Providence , that man should be surrounded with inferior animals under his control , which , by their capacities , make up for the defects of his physical power . He has the horse , and can command his strength ; and , more than all , he has the dog  --  the most intelligent of animals  --  to become his servant and friend . In order that the dog should belong wholly to man , he has been formed eminently for friendship and devotion , even at the sacrifice of much of the instinctive passions all animals have for their own kind ; for the dog cares more for the society of his human friends than he does for that of his own species . Abel , the second son of Adam , is mentioned as a keeper of sheep ; the dog , therefore , was probably the second animal tamed by man , for , as the companion of the shepherd , he has been known in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wolf and the jackal ; and even now , when circumstances have occurred to cause the dog to live in a wild state , he assumes more or less the wolfish form and expression . In fact , dogs belonging to our Indian tribes and those which so infest the suburbs of Oriental cities , appear to be but little removed in physical form from the supposed original type . It has been suggested , with apparent truth , that the do* being coeval with man in the East , must have aided in a very gi eat degree in the superior early civilization of Asia . Having the dog , the indigenous races had time to spare from the TilE JAcKAL . OiGNiTY AND IMPUDENcE. // painful labors of the chase to create the blessings of industry . Hence the origin of the arts and trades , and a key to the difference in the civilization between the old and new continents for the dog was unknown to America before it was introduced by European discoverers. 1/ k*&gt;* K&lt;. * K Although there exists a strange animosity between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and circumstances occur in which they form friendly relations and live in brotherhood . The wild dog-or , rather , the dog by . accident returned to a wild state-will unite with the wolf to attack a beast , when the combination is necessary to insure victory . The dog and the wolf pursue the same system in hunting ; while some are in ambuscade , others lead and give voice on the trail , to indicate to their accomplices the direction of the aninial pursued . The half-savage hunters of the wilds of the Cape of Good Hope and of the forests of America , hold in high estimation the dogs which are iunaways from civilization , and try by every art in their power to get possession of their leaders . The wolf cub can be trained to the service of man , and evidence exists that they are capable of the strongest attachment , and highly susceptible of cultivation . The first dog that hunted in company with man , following the mighty Nimrod , was unquestionably a species of tawny greyhound , still to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strangle the wild boar . All nations of classic antiquity have in turn claimed the honor of the birth-place of the hunting-dog . The Greek mythology has many legends , the most striking of which is , that the twins of Leda first followed game , and we have Castor and Pollux among the stars still engaged in their favorite pursuits . The type of the primitive animal is best preserved , among those familiar to us , in the European shepherd dog . It is a light animal , cut for the course , with eyes piercing , ears fine and straight , air alert and spiritual . Its coat of hair is rough , and its tail sweeps the ground . All hunting-dogs that we now possess proceed from this breed . In the ear of the dog we most discover the effects of domestication . The finer , more hanging and tremulous is this organ , the more the animal departs from the original type . ( See how truly artificial are the dogs given in the illustration on the preceding page , copied from Landseer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purest shepherd dog , the ears are erect and pointed as a cat 's ; in fact , no wild animal of p**y has pendent ears . The butcher-boy , with the instinct of a savage nature , trims up the ears of his bull-dog , and destroys with the knife the evidences of long slavery and civilization , thus restoring the head of his favorite to the truly ferocious expression , originally impressed by the Creator himself . The dog is nowhere spoken of with kindness in the Old Testament or the New ; and the Jews in the Eastern countries retain their dislike to the animal even to this day . Their example has not been lost upon the Turks ; for with them the dog has no owner , and is simply permitted to exist as the scavenger of the streets . The consequence is , that the dog of the East has degenerated below the standard of the true savage ; for , in his questionable position , like the half-civilized Indian , he retains none of the virtues of his original state , and acquires all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says a distinguished traveler , " the dog loses all his good qualities ; he is no longer the faithful animal , attached to his master , and ready to defend him even at the expense of his life ; on the contrary , he is cruel and blood-thirsty-n gloomy egotist , cut off from all human intercourse , but not the less a slave . " homer has used the faithfulness of the dog to give point to one of his most beautiful episodes . Ulysses , for many years a wanderer , returns to his home so altered in his appearance that the most beloved of human friends did not recognize him . " The faithful dog alone his rightful master knew ; him when he saw , lie rose and crawl 'd to meetTwas all he could  --  and fawad , and kissed liii feet . " In the great church at Delft , in Holland , is a magnificent mausoleum , erected in 1609 , to William , first Prince of Orange ; at the feet of the statue reclines a dog , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief at the murder of his master . Lord Byron had the rare experience , he writes , of having a once faithful dog forget him after a long separation . We doubt the fact , and ascribe the incident to that morbid misanthropy that discolored every thing in the poet 's mind . It is ps*bable , that returning to Newstead Abbey , his face darkened by passion and his disposition soured , he , unconsciously to himself ; repulsed the first advances of his canine friend , and afterward magnified the incident , and used it to close a couplet written in the darklings of his saddest muse . We are confirmed in this opinion , because later in life he says : " The poor dog ! in life the firmest fijend , The first to welcome , foremost to defend : Whose honest heart is still isis master 's own ; Who labors , fights , lives , breathes for him alone . " TILE WOLF . // In treating of dogs , and in giving anecdotes of their sagacity , the question is powerfully forced upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct ends and reason hegins . The great difference between animals and plants is the presence of the mental system ; for we think that whenever a dog , or any other animated creature , sees , hears , or remembers , he evinces the possession of mind , which is another term for the action of the brain and nervous system . The term instinct is va*ue and unsatisfactory ; it is the dark hiding-place of all who do not , or care not to think ; for it is almost as difficult to separate the acts of instinct from the acts of the mind in human beings as it is in the lower orders of animals . Every created thing that has a brain , has a memory , has a past , and applies its experience for the benefit of its future happiness . An old dog in a bear-hunt is as cautious of Bruin 's teeth as an old broker is of suspicious stocks ; and both act on the same principle  --  the recollection of being bitten " in a previous transaction . " Insects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hive and its inhabitants-obliterate every vesti1 , e of its having been , and the few stra*gling bees that escape the general destruction , will for days hover over the very spot in which they were accustomed to deposit their honey , and be indefatigable in trying to hunt up their old home . Ants have friendships and antipathies ; and is it therefore strange that the dog , formed for the companion of man , should have a correspondingly high development of mind ? He is therefore indeed intelligent , and appears only to lack voice to give evidence of having a soul . The dog is grateful , chivalrous , patient under adversity , and the truest of friends . He is subject to seasons of joyous exhilaration and fits of despondency . He appreciates refined society , and will often die rather than accept the company inferior to his caste . Upon comprehending the value of having a broken limb set hy a surgeon , he can impart his knowledge to his fellow dogs , and bring the unfortunate of his race limping to the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting into his flesh to remove a tumor , and , amidst his pain , give forth the most affecting signs of gratitude . He does a thousand things which often display even more capacity than is manifested by some of the unfortunate sons of the human race . Where , therefore , we repeat , does reason begin and instinct end ? What is the intrinsic difference between Carlo and Newton ? Man , and man alone , understands the properties of matter , and from induction as well as experience , provides for the necessaries of life . In all things which most display the sagacity of animals , man is his superior . In endurance , he can tire down and kill the horse ; on the trail he is more sagacious than the hound ; by knowisig all the laws of nature , he swims with the fish , flies with the bird ; by delicate instruments , he rivals the insects in the knowledge of the changes in the atmosphere ; and by arms , he overcomes the fiercest beasts of prey . The reason of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enli* , htened by experience-yet we may well repeat " Remembrance and reflection how allied , What thin partitions sense from tisought divide . " The intelligence of man , on the contrary , has no limits  --  the past and the present conduct him into the future ; and herein he so immeasurably surpasses the brute creation . The quality of mind is the same , it differs only in the extent . John Randolph , who was the acutcst of metaphysicians , said he knew a dog once that , in pursuit of his master , came to a place where three roads branched off  --  the dog ran down one road and carefully scented the earth , then ran down the second road and carefully scented it , without furtlser hesitation he rapidly took the third road and accomplished his purpose . Randolph said the argument in the dog 's mind was as follows : " My master , I perceive , when he came to these forks , did not take either of the two roads I examined ; therefore lie must have taken the third " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of the reasoning power . In giving portraits and histories of dogs , we shall commence with the lowest grade of the race , and proceed to those justly remarkable for their reasoning powers . The Bull Dog is the most brutal and the least intelligent of its species ; its depressed forehead , its underhanging jaw , and bloodshot eyes , unite in forming the very personification of the savage . Although capable of some attachment , it can not be relied upon ns a friend . So utterly without intellect is the courage of the bull dog , that it will attack any thing that gives offense . This dog has never been a pet in the United States ; but in England , among a large class df citizens , it is carefully raised , and employed in bull-baits-exhibitions that find no parallel for brutality in any other country , savage or refined . In these bull-baits the dog , while fastened to the nose of some unfortunate bull , has had one leg after another cut off with a knife , to test its courage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " rural population , " and by the TILE auaa noo. // qwq hopeless task of springing at every person who passed along , either on pleasure or business . The owner , first mate of the vessel , would sit for hours and detail the wonderful deeds of this mighty dog . Crowds of idlers daily collected , and there stood the hero , or rather , there raved the insane creature at the multitude , each individual indulging the vague hope , that he would presently break loose and pitch into somebody , and thus show his prowess . Among the idlers was an Indian who occasionally visited the city , and made a few pence by shooting an arrow at pennies stuck in the end of a stick . Upon the very appearance of the Indian , the bull dog was particularly violent , greatly to the amusement of the fellow , who took a malicious pleasure in irritating the animal . THE MASTIFF . The mate finally interfered , and told the Indian to go away , lest the dog might break as the popular watch-dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Terriers seem to have been designed especially to kill rats , for they are indefatigable in their pursuit , and will do an incredible amount of hard labor to unearth the vermin . Their courage is wonderful ; they attack the fox and the otter in their holes , and generally come off victors . On one occasion we were en*a*ed in a hear hunt , and among the pack of stout hounds was a little terrier , that ran off from the plantation , and , apparently out of pure mischief , kept up with the running dogs . Bruin was finally brought to hay , and when the hunters came up they found him on his hind-legs , the hounds forming a circle at a respectful distance from him , while the ridiculous little terrier was inside of the ring , snarling and growling , and occasionally rendering the bear perfectly insane with fury , by attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying rats is illustrated by exhibitions , where a dog is matched to kill a certain number of rats in a given time . A ring is prepared , the vermin are brought in bags , and , to the amount of a hundred , put into it . The dog is then set over the railing . The rats-most ferocious animals when cornered-finding escape impossible , will turn en masse on the dog , and seize hold of him , and hang on , until the terrier 's head and shoulders scorca TEREIER. are absolutely concealed from view . Meanwhile the courageous little creature , with immense rapidity and certainty , selects his victims , and , giving them a single bite in the loins , continues his work until all the rats are dead , finishing the hundred in seven or eight minutes . The Scotch Terrier is similar in habits to the one already noticed , but very different in personal appearance . His hair is long and wiry , concealing his eyes and symmetry of form . The principal beauty of some of these coarse-haired terriers consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can appeal to every one for sympathy , on the poetical principle , that " handsome is who handsome does . " The Greyhound is the fleetest of all dogs ; his form indicates his power of speed , being more light and airy than even the deer . He is principally used in " coursing , " when he chases , by sight , the hare over the open country . The speed of the greyhound is very little inferior to the best horses , and in a broken country would *nobably outstrip the fleetest of them . Although this graceful animal hunts by sight only , his scent is very exquisite , as will be seen in the following anecdote : A hound , quite celebrated , was brought from Glasgow to Edinburgh in the hoot of a coach , a distance of forty-two miles . A few days afterward she made her escape , and returned to her kennel . This hound must have followed the track she scented in the air in her journey to Edinburgh . The greyhound was the favorite of the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was the inmate of their houses , and fed from the family table . The beauty of the form of the greyhound is wonderfully harmonious with the delicate sentiment so peculiar to all Grecian art , and under the training of that wonderful people their qualities were more fully developed than in modern times . The group of dogs claiming the most attention is the one known as Spaniels , including specimens of the race most remarkable for their docility and affectionate disposition . These good qualities are eminently combined with such unexceptionable beauty , that they are al TuE TEauIEa . THE GREYIIOUKD. // qwq he , with an inflexible purpose , that makes him appear for the time as if carved in stone . In this attitude he continues until the gun is discharged , reloaded , and the sportsman has reached the place whence the bird " sprung .

He is the game was thus secured . the ahle assistant of sportsmen in hunting the wild duck . It is supposed he was originally from Spain , and is probably descended from the large water-dog and English setter . From the moment he attaches himself to his owner , the intensity of his affection is scarcely conceivable ; and he is apparently never happy unless near his master 's person , resting his head upon his foot , lying upon some portion of his apparel , with his eye intently fixed upon his master , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supposed to be the spaniel , improved in size and beauty , and by many is preferred to the pointer , in pursuit of small game .

" The setter has in his favor elegance of form , vigor of muscles , and power of thought ; but he is not faithful , as has been too often asserted . The setter allows himself to be beloved by greenhorns , but he never loves any other than the accomplished hunter . We remember in our youth of having often suffered from the contempt of a setter named Ajax , whom we courted every day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattered us in return by every expression of his good-will while at the teble , but in the field he no longer knew us .

" The speed of the fox-hound is quite equal to that of the best horses , which shows how perfectly it is adapted to the chase . In England the fox-hound is so much a favorite , that it is no figurative expression to say that more books have been written upon its training , and more attention has been paid to its proper development , than ever was lavished upon the poor people of the same country . The man who has charge of a gentleman 's dogs , is of more importance than the teacher of the gentleman 's sons ; the poor curate may be a very brute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman who has charge of the dogs , Mr. Beckford says , " must be young , strong , active , bold , and enterprising . He should be sensible , good-tempered , sober , exact , and cleanly  --  a good groom , and an excellent horseman . His voice should be clear and strong , with an eye so quick as to perceive which of his hounds carries the scent when all are running , and an ear so excellent as to distinguish the leading hounds when he does not see them . lie should be quiet , patient , and without conceit . Such are the qualities which constitute perfection he the man who takes care of the dogs . He should not , " continues Mr. Beckford , " be too fond of displaying them until called forth by necessity , it being a peculiar and distinguishing trait in his character , to let his hounds alone while they hunt , and have genius to assist them when they can not . " Here are qualities that sum up all human perfection , requisites demanded that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne , but which are positively essential , to get a fox-hound fairly up to its Cambridge and Eton degree . Our space will not permit us to particularize the residences of the English fox hound . They are really as splendid as art and human ingenuity , brought down to the level of a dog 's wants , can make them-even the most ordinary specimens having the corners of the doorways rounded , lest they should injure the dog as he passes in and out . We have seen plans and directions for building kennels that provide for palaces , lawns , and all the " modern improvements " in house warming and ventilation , and which sink into sublime nothingness the much-cherished American work dedicated to the protection of human beings , and known as " Do'vning 's Landscape Gardening . " The Beagle , although ( as we have already observed ) similar in its habits to the fox hound , vet is very diminutive , being scarcely ten inches high , and a running pack is much admired , because they keep close together  --  a trait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is sometimes followed by hunters on foot , and its THE BLOODHOUND. principal game is the hare .

" This diminutive little creature has roceived much of its celebrity from the fact that it was a great favorite with the merry monarch , Charles II. , and frequently appears upon the pictures of the court beauties painted by Kneller and Lely .

The deserted monks have moved their hostelry down the side of the mountains , to administer to the luxurious tastes rather than to the terrible necessities of travelers . We very much fear that they will degenerate from the stern virtues so long their heritage in the inhospitable regions of the upper air , and that their noble race of dogs , now no longer necessary to save life , will also he conquered by effeminate habits ; and , losing the admirable qualities of their ancestors , sink into ig * noble obscurity . The favorite dog  --  the Newfoundland-is one of the largest of his qwq sea . A large portrait of a Newfoundland dog is quite popular even in this country . The dog is represented with a medal round his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the humane society . " Illustrative of his usefulness in saving life , is the well-authenticated anecdote of a vessel that was driven on the beach of Lydd , in Kent . The surf was rolling furiously . Eight poor fellows were crying for help , but no boat could live in endeavoring to go to their assistance . At length is gentleman came on the beach aecompanied by a Newfoundland dog . He directed the attention of the animal to the vessel , and put a short stick in his mouth . The intelligent and courngeous fellow at once understood his meaning ; springing into the sea , he fought his way through the waves . He could not , however , get close enough to the vessel to deliver that with which he was charged ; hut the crew understood what was meant , and they made fast a rope to another piece of wood , and threw it toward him . The noble creature dropped the one in his mouth , and seized that which had been cast to him , and then , with a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again lost under the waves-he dragged it through the surge , and delivered it to his master ; a line of communication was thus formed with the boat , and all on board were saved . But the most interesting and useful of all the class of dogs we have been describing , and of all dogs whatever , is the companion of the shepherd . As a guardian of sheep he is more perfect than in any other pursuit , for the shepherd dog frequently acts independently of his master , and takes at times entire control of his helpless charge . Sheep are the favorite food of all wild dogs and of wolves ; and it is also a fact , that the shepherd dog is nearer the original type of his race than any other . With this knowledge we can form some idea of the immense power the shepherd dog 's education has over his original nature , to make him not only forego destroying the tender Jamb , but also sacrifice his entire life to its protection . In Scotland and Spain , the shepherd dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated as one of the greatest blessings of a beneficent Providence . In Scotia , Hogg and Burns both commenced life upon their native bleak hills , watching their flocks , with no other constant companion than the faithful dog ; it is not only truly interesting , but really affecting to read the passionate outpourings of these two sons of song in his praise . With all their imagination and heartiness , they never found language sufficiently strong to do justice to their feelings of admiration . Hogg acknowledges that he " never felt so grateful to any creatare under the sun as he did to his honest Sirrah ! " Burns , in equally passionate language , writes , " that the master is the soul of the dog ; all the powers and faculties of its nature are devoted to his master 's service ; and these powers and faculties are ennobled hy the intercourse . " He concludes , " Divines tell us that it ought just to be so with the Christian ; but the dog puts the Christian to shame . " That the shepherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is devoted , is powerfully suggested in the singular trait of its history ; that more than any other of its species it retains , in spite of every circumstance , its peculiar character . While other dogs degenerate or improve , or have their radical qualities obliterated , the shepherd dog seems to have innate energy enough to overcome every other blood , and ever remain the same , confirming the opinion , that the shepherd dog stock is the most perfect of the whole species . It is safe to say that commerce is indebted for the wool which appears in so many costly fabrics to the watchful care of the shepherd dog , for the master could not raise the staple , so as to supply it at reasonable prices , / K ! /**z - - , /&gt;Th r ' /- " 1/ THE NEWFOTTNDLANI ) Doe .

The shepherd dogs of Spain and Mexico are the finest in the world , and , armed with an iron collar covered with points , are a match for the most savage wolf . One thousand sheep require the attention of two men and two dogs . The manner of training them in the countries alluded to is interesting : the puppies , at their birth , are taken from their mother and suckled by a ewe previously deprived of her lambs . The consequence is , that the dogs associate at once with the sheep , become attached to particular flocks , and seem to feel a degree of affection that would naturally spring up in generous minds toward those to whose fostering care they were so much indebted . Landseer-who devotes his great genius to painting the few domestic animals of England - has produced portraits of hounds , pointers , and shepherd dogs that vie favorably , in good looks and intelligence , with many of the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His great triumph has been a picture of two shepherd dogs , lying on a rock , just beneath which is sheltered an ewe aud twin lambs . These dogs are , indeed , the protectors of the flocks-one is gazing in the distance for his master , the other looks down , with silken eyelash and beaming eye , upon the helpless charge beneath , expressing a tenderness and concern that has rarely been surpassed in the thousand Madonnas which have been the pride of art , and considered the acme of human maternity . Having completed our list of dogs , illustrative of the best known varieties , we add two by way of ornament : one , the envy of certain beaux ; the other , famous for its intelligence . " The ladies ' pet " is the modern King Charles spaniel ; but so degenerate from the original breed as to retain little else of its excellences than TUE LAmEs ' PET . the soft coating of fur and silken ears . The short muzzle and round vulgar forehead of the bull-dog makes it decidedly repulsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a deformity , and its stupid expression corresponds with the mental development of this happy creature . Such are the dogs that noble dukes and duchesses make companions of , and humble people imitate the example . They can he seen in England , and occasionally in our own country , lolling their unmeaning heads out of a carriagewindow , and casting looks of apparent contempt upon the poor passers-by . What is the charm about them to ladies is past our comprehension . The example attending the devotion of the sex to such pets injures society ; for bipeds , anxious to gain a smile from lips so often buried in the lap-dog 's fur , descend themselves into imitations of the veriest puppies , making it questionable which is most degraded  --  the ambition , or the taste that demands such qualities in the conventional lords of the creation . We can not admire too much the lady , who congratulated herself that her lap-dog escaped any serious injury from biting the extremities of her accepted lover . Juno was a dog in which were mingled the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a family remarkable for intelligence ; for with dogs , even more than with men , talents are hereditary . This *dayful , intelligent creature , without any instruction , performed so many feats that she won a wide celebrity . So fond was she of her reasoning playmates , that she would at any time abandon her puppies to have a romp with the children . As a nurse , she took care of " the baby , " and would follow it about , pick up its l ) laytllings , rock its cradle , and carefully restore to its hands the " chicken bone , " for the moment dropped on the floor . Having once accompanied her master on a fishing excursion , she afterward would dig angleworms , draw the fishing-rod from its hooks , and insist in the stable that the horse should be saddled , and then lead the animal by the bridle up to the door . Her kind care extended to the chickens and ducks , and if any of the little ones were lamed or died , she at nightfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thrust them under the maternal wings . When the garden was made Juno seemed to admire the nicely-arranged beds , and throughout the whole summer , looked through the palings with indignation at what she supposed to he the intruding plants in the nicely-prepared ground . Juno never would allow the servants to possess in peace any property once belonging to her master , mistress , or their children , which was not formallygiven awayin herpresence ; in that case , she never noticed the articles at all . In New Orleans this dog attracted a great deal of attention , because she would not touch the poisoned sausages thrown into the sfreets . She did not confine her useful labors exclusively to those who owned her , but would restore lost property , when she met with it , that belonged to any of the neighbors . She appeared to understand the meaning of words , and would instantly show by her manner how peifectly she comprehended the passing conversation . If any subject was alluded to in which she took an interest , she would bark and caper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things alluded to . She would remain perfectly quiet , with an affectionate eye alone upon her master , through long discussions on politics or philosophy ; but let any thing be said ahout angling or hunting , about the poultry in the yard , or kindred subjects , and she would go almost crazy with delight . This dog , combining within herself the qualities of the two most intelligent hreeds of her kind , seemed but little removed from a reasoning , intelligent being ; there were , at times , expressions in her eye , of affection , of thought , of sorrow , of joy , so very human that it was painful , and startled the imagination for the moment with the idea that Pythagoras was indeed correct , and that the souls of former men were imprisoned in the bodies of animals ; for it was easy , in contemplating this remarkable dog , to suppose that she was possessed of a hidden intelligence not properly belonging to brute life . And yet Juno was only one of the many intelligent beings so frequently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their humble sphere , teach us lessons of devotion , disinterestedness , and friendship . India is remarkable for wild dogs , among which is the poor Pariah , an inhabitant of the confines of civilization , and yet is never fairly adopted into human society . This dog , naturally gentle , a British officer relates , was caught by the natives in great numbers , and used to feed a tiger , kept in the garrison for the amusement of visitors . On one occasion , a pariah , instead of yielding to fear , stood on the defensive , and as the tiger approached he seized him by the upper lip . This continued to be done several days , when the tiger not only ceased his attacks but divided his food with the poor dog , and became his friend , and the two animals occupied the same cage for many years . An old lion , in the Tower of London , conceived a liking for a little dog that accidentally got into his care , and the two animqls became inseparable . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little puppy , who would bark at visitors while the old lion would look dignifiedly on , seemingly determined to assist his little friend out of any difficulties his presumption might lead to . At the battle of Palo Alto there were two dogs belonging to the officers of Ringold 's battery , which amused themselves in the battle by watching at the mouths of the pieces for the discharge of the balls , and then chased them across the plain as long as they were in sight . Things got a little too hot finally for one of them , and he retreated back to Point Isabel . The soldiers in that intrenchment saw Carlo coming across the prairie , and indulged the idea that he had brought a letter of " how fared the day . " A French officer , engaged in the war of Algiers , owned a dog who conceived a great taste for the carnage of battle , and watched his m* ster 's gun , and ran among the enemy to find " the victim , " the same as if the wounded man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of holding on the " game " with a determined tooth when found , cost the dog his life . An Arab chief happened only to be " winged " by his master 's weapon , and when the dog seized the son of the desert , be was instantly stabbed to the heart . Some years ago , it was not uncommon in Connecticut to employ dogs as motive-power to light machinery . A Mr. Brill had a pair of dogs which he employed together on a sort of tread-mill . After a while the motion of the machinery was noticed from time to time to be considerably retarded , when the tender would go to the mill to see if the dogs were doing their duty , and every thing appeared to be right . Another and another interruption would occur , and so continued , until the owner began to suspect that his dogs were playing some trick upon him . Accordingly he I ) laced an observer where all the movements of the animals could be seen , and the mystery was thus explained . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them was seen to step off the tread-mill and seat himself where he could catch the first warning of any approaching footstep . After he had rested awhile he took his place at the wheel again , and allowed his associate to rest : thus these sagacious creatures continued to bear each other 's burdens . A Miss Cliilds , a keeper of a tavern in London , quite recently possessed a black and white spaniel which performed tricks almost surpassing belief . This dog could play at games of whist , cribbage , and dominoes . In playing these games the dog was placed behind a screen , and had the cards all arranged before him ; over this screen he watched his antagonist , and reached with his mouth the suite required . Out of a pack of cards he would instantly select the best cribbage and whist . On the names of any city , county , or town being placed by printed cards before him , the dog would , without hesitation , fetch the one requested , and at the bidding of // any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could , by the aid of printed cards , tell how many persons might be in the room , how many hats , or the number of coins any one might throw on the floor . After being taken out of the room , if any one present touched a card , the dog on his return would designate it . So numerous , indeed , were the evidences of intelligence exhibited by this dog , that it was impossible to resist the impression that he was possessed of reason . An unfortunate dog , in order to make sport for some fools , had a pan tied to his tail , and was sent off on his travels to a neighboring town . He reached his place of destination perfectly exhausted , and lay down before the steps of a tavern , eying most anxiously the horrid annoyance fastened behind him , but unable to move a step farther to rid himself of the torment . Another dog , a Scotch shepherd , laid himself down beside him , and , by a few caresses , gaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string by which the noisy appendage was attached to his friend 's tail , and with about a quarter of an hour 's exertion , severed the cord , and started to his legs , with the pan hanging from the string in his mouth , and after a few joyful capers , departed on his travels in the highest glee at his success . Dogs are superstitious , and easily alarmed by any thing that is strange or wonderfully incomprehensible to their experience . We knew a very fine mastiff once to issue out upon a little negro . The child , in its alarm , stepped back and fell into a hole at the root of a tree . The dog perceiving the sudden disappearance of its object of hatred , became alarmed , and finally , with the utmost terror depicted in its actions , retreated back to its hiding-place . Some years ago , while traveling up the Mississippi river , in common with other passengers on the steamer we were attracted by the docility and intelligence of a pointer dog . This excellent animal would voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners , and seemed to desire to render himself popular by doing such kindly offices . The trick he performed , however , which created most surprise , was taking notes from gentlemen to their wives in the ladies ' cabin . This he would do whenever called upon . The person sending the note , would simply call the dog , and his master would give him the directions what to do , and we believe he never made a mistake . The dog would take the paper in his mouth , go among the lady **sengers and hunt around , and finally put the note in the lap of the person for whom it was intended . This apparently extraordinary mark of intelligence , created a great deal of amusement , yet it was the most simple exhibition of the dog 's power that could he given , for it will be found on examination that it is still more strange that a pointer should perceive the vicinity of partridges at many yards distance , than that he should discover a gentleman 's wife sitting within touching distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions of the half-civilized dog is witnessed in polar countries , where he performs the office of the horse , and draws heavy sledges over the wastes of snow . The faithful pack flee over the hard ribbed ice , and , by their speed , make the cutting wind of the north sting as if broken glass were entes4ing the eyes . The storm sighs along the expansive waste , and the snow-clouds , like winding-sheets , seem closing in on the weary travelers . No star is seen aloft to give a ray of hopeman , immortal , powerful man , is at the mercy of his canine friends . God save us ! ' exclaim the alarmed voyagers . The prayer had been answered in the beginning , ' for they were in the charge of the faithful dog , who could find his way where there were no roads , no trace of vegetation to mark the path . Suddenly the pack appears at fault  --  the leader questions the air , asserts his full voice , and dashes on . Urged by his encouraging example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours wear away . At last , as the night is closing in , a thin pennon of dark smoke detaches itself upon the distant horizon : the sign betrays the dwelling of man , the journey is accomplished . The four-footed gnides ask for no wages-an oral expression of satisfaction , and they are content ; yet humaji guides over the less dangerous passes of the Alps and Pyrenees would have , for similar services , demanded exaggerated sums . " An artist who had had a great deal of trouble to please a rather captious duchess , finally consented that the truthfulness of the picture should be left to the decision of the lady 's pet spaniel . The picture was sent home , the aristocratic lady hid herself away hehind the window curtains , and the little dog-critic was ushered into the room . Without much hesitation the animal approached the picture , wagged its tail as if in joy , and fell to licking the face . The duchess was delighted , complimented the artist on his skill , and paid him a high price for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portrait had beeuu covered over with lard , and that the dog 's nose was sharper than the critic 's eyes . When some of our troops , taken prisoners by Santa Anna , were passing from Buena Vista to the city of Mexico , they were , in common with all travelers in Mexico , astonished at the number of dogs they met in the streets of the villages . At Saltillo , on one occasion , the American prisoners were detained in the highway by their guards stopping to look at a dog fight . The spectators were very numerous , brought together by the rare show of the " captured North Americans " and the canine battle . The dogs seemed to be unequally matched ; one was a large brindle , of ferocious aspect and braggadocio appearance ; the other was a little compact animal , of undistinguished personality , but which attended to his fighting with steady pertinacity . The " greasers " named the big dog " Santa Anna ; " and the Americans the little one " Old Zack . " After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled in the mud , and pretty severely handled , he got his competitor down , and seizing him by the throat , held on until " Santa Anna " roared with pain . A general shout of exultation ensued among the Mexicans . The chivalrous conduct of the little dog even won upon their sympathies , and they joined , much to the mortification of the " regular troops , " in giving three cheers for Generni Zachariah Taylor Innumerable anecdotes might be given of dogs which not only saved hum*an beings from death , but have anticipated approaching evil , and thus guarded their master in advance . Travelers , dreaming of no evil , have gone to bed at night at hotels , when their dogs have discovered among the people of the inn suspicious circumstances , and given the alarm . The son of Dr. Dwight relates , that his father , the greatest theological writer our country has ever produced , was indebted to a dog for his life , the faithful animal obtruding iu his pathway , and compelling his horse to turn out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor discovered that if he had pursued his journey according to his intent , he would have been dashed down a precipice , where to escape with his life would have been an impossibility . It is no uncommon circumstance for certain persons to keep dogs and guns for hire . So intelligent are some pointers , that they will go with any stranger who has a fowling-piece they are familiar with . It is not uncommon for persons to hire these necessaries of hunting , who know nothing of the use of either . In such cases the dog wilt often flush the game , and discovering that " the gentleman " does not know how to shoot , will abandon the hunt altogether , and go home in disgust . In man , the brain forms one-thirtieth part of his whole body-in the Newfoundland dog one seventieth-in the bull-dog one three-hundredth part . An English gentleman discovered , one morning , that some miscreant had cut off the ears and tail of a favorite horse . A blood-hound was brought to the stable , which at once detected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty miles . The hound then stopped at a door , whence no power could move him . Being at length admitted , he ran to the top of the house , and , bursting open the door of a garret room , found the object he sought in bed , and would have torn hha to pieces , had not the hnntsman , who had followed the dog on a fleet horse , rushed to the rescue . Some extraordinary data exist of the fleetness of fox-hounds . A match race was once run over the Beacon Course , Newmarket , England-a distance of four miles , one furlong , and one hundred and thirty-two yards . The winnin* dog performed the distance in eight minutes and a few seconds ; but of the sixty horses that started with the hounds , only twelve were able to run in with them . A gentleman was missed in London , and it was supposed he had met with some foul play . No clew could be obtained to the mystery , when his dog was discovered sitting before an attractive shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal to leave the place . It was finally suggested that he might be waiting for his master . The house , always above suspicion of wrong , was searched , and there was not only discovered the body of the missing gentleman , but also other bodies of people who had been murdered in the same house . The guilty parties were arrested , and acknowledged their crimes  --  and one of the most terrible of all the dens of London was broken up by the " police knowledge " of the dog . Dogs are extensively used on the Belgian frontiers for smuggling . The animals trained to these " dishonest habits , " are conducted in packs to the foreign frontier , where they are kept without food for many hours ; they are then beaten and laden , and at the beginning of the night started on their travels . They reach the abode of their masters , which is generally two or three leagues from the frontiers , as speedily as they can , where they are sure to be well treated and provided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of large size , and do much mischief to property , inasmuch as , in going to their place of destination , they take the most direct course across the country . A Western gentleman being very much annoyed all night on a steamer by a barking dog , in the morning hunted up its owner , and proposed to purchase a half or quarter interest in the animal . The owner seemed surprised , and asked the gentleman " what he would do with a partnership of that kind . " " I think , " said the " hoosier , " with great solemnity , " that if I did own an interest in that dog , I should kill my share immediately . " Dogs sometimes join a fire-company , and run regularly with the engines . Several of this kind have been known in New York . There was a famous fire-dog in London , which lived indiscriminately with the firemen-sometimes choosing to live with one , sometimes with another . He was a regular attendant at every fire ; and was always seen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day a magistrate happened to hear of the dog , and expressed a wish to see him . A messenger was accordingly dispatched , and Tyke made his appearance borne in the arms of a policeman . He was not easily persuaded to leave his house , and the only way was to make a fireman run in a hurry up the street . Tyke immediately set out after him ; hut on seeing the man slacken his pace , he knew there was no fire , and turned indignantly hack . The messenger found that he could be induced to go no farther ; so he was obliged to pick him up and carry him . Tyke lived for many years , following the engines to the fires , and was always fed and kindly cared for by the firemen . He was of the terrier breed , of rather a grim , tattered appearance , no doubt resulting from his manner of life . // A French merchant having some money due him , set out on horseback , accompanied by his dog , to receive it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and began his journey home . The merchant , after riding some miles , alighted to repose himself , and taking the bag of money in his hand , laid it down by his side under a hedge , and , on remounting , forgot it . The dog perceived this error , and , wishing to rectify it , ran to fetch the bag ; but it was too heavy for him to drag along . He then ran to his master , and by crying , barking , and howling , seemed to be determined to remind his master of his loss . The merchant , absorbed in some reverie , wholly overlooked the real object of his affectionate attendant 's importunity , and conceived the alarming apprehension that the dog had gone mad . Deeply lamenting the necessity of parting with his dog , and constantly more and more impressed that he was really rabid , he drew a pistol from his pocket , and , turning his head away , fired . The aim was but too true  --  the faithful animal fell wounded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , involuntarily reaching out his hand , he discovered his loss . In an instant he comprehended his rashness and folly , and turning his horse , galloped back to the place where he stopped . He discovered the traces of blood , but he lpoked in vain for the dog-he had crawled , wounded as he was , to the forgotten bag , and lay down beside it as a guard . When he saw his master , he testified his joy by wagging his tail ; and in attempting to caress his master , he cast his last look of affection in his face , and fell back , and died . A writer in a London paper mentions that he saw a blind man look with much apparent interest at the prints in Dolnaghi 's window . " Why , my friend , " said he , " it seems you are not blind ? " " Blind ! no , thank God , your honor , " replied the man ; " I have my blessed sight as well as another . " " Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string ? " asked the gentleman . " Why , because I hedicates dogs for the blind , " was the satisfactory reply . To show that this education is effective , mention is made by a traveler in Europe , who saw a good-looking poodle-dog , which came to the coach-door and sat upon his hind legs with the air of one begging for something . " Giv*him . a cent , " said the carriage-driver , " and you will see what he will do with it . " The money was thrown ; the dog picked it up , ran to a baker 's and brought back a piece of bread , which he ate . The dog had belonged to a blind man lately dead , and having no master , begged alms on his own account . There are dogs in Rome who can distinguish between charitably-disposed persons and others not so inclined , and who will lead their masters up to houses where they feel assured something will be given , and avoid those at which the rude repulse will be met with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog that belonged to a shoe-black in Paris . The animal , in his desire to serve his master , would roil in the gutters , and then manage to throw some mud on the shoes of the passers-by . A gentleman having had his feet soiled two or three times the same morning , taxed the shoeblack with the imposition . The man acknowledged that he had taught the dog the trick , and that it was the chief means of obtaining him a livelihood . Hammond , of the Albany Register , describes a dog who might be termed one of the bhoy 's . He was a shaggy , crop-eared , wiry , keen-eyed cur ; an animal that might be bet on , as being ever ready for a fight , or for any sort of canine devilment , at the shortest possible notice , and probably did run " wid de machine , " and cultivate a " soap-lock " over the left " blinker . " The owner of this dog wore a jaunty cap that one might safely swear had been acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sort of shaggy cross between a monkey-jacket and a frock-coat , in making up of which a large allowance had been made for at least two years ' growth . His pants were of the same material , and at the bottom were rolled half-way up to his knees , through which his lean shanks protruded , the extremitiel of which were incased in a pair of stogy shoes , that seemed to have been made with special reference to the creation of corns . The dog and his owner , having quietly ensconced themselves on top of a pier-post , the two took a dignified survey of the people round . " Speak to the gentlemen , " ordered the master ; whereupon Pomp opened his mouth and gave forth three or four distinct bow-wows . " Gentlemen , " said the occupant of the post , " this is one of the dogs you 've beam tell of . He 's a great dog , wonderful dog , a dog that should n't belong all to one individual . He 's too valuable a property for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 made a stock-dog of-to be divided into shares , and owned by a company-he should . A corporation as owned that dog would make a noise in the world . There would be a big dividend on the stock , you may bet high on that . There 'd be no bust up about it . T would be a safe investment , and sure pay . " The dog seemed to understand the compliment of his master ; and the two , at the conclusion of the speech , formed a couple of as independent and impudent specimens of " city life " as could be found this side of any where .
