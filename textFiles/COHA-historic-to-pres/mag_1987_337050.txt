They look like the scrawny camp followers of a medieval army as they gather under a huge bluff called Dongordo . The earth is boiled beige , with hardly a blade of green . There are nearly 7,000 of them , and they began assembling here long before dawn . Dressed in ragged homespun cotton and wrapped in long shawls called netela , they come in entire families , grandfathers and grandchildren . The men hold herding sticks ; the women carry babies bound to their backs with cloth . And then there are the youngsters , some of them naked and with their heads shaved except for a single tuft in front . They are strangely silent . <P> The multitude comes from two Ethiopian villages , Asbi and Habes , in the dusty , barren hills to the north . Some walked all day and all night across 31 miles of craggy terrain to reach this scorched patch just outside Wukro , a district capital in the province of Tigre . Once again a drought has cursed Tigre , and once again the hungry have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves past the rough wood table to register for the donations . Each supplicant dips a finger in purple dye to ensure that there is no cheating for seconds . " It is worse this year than it was in 1984 and 1985 , " laments Chief Elder Muboulle Osman , a tall , worried-looking man of about 50 . " There are 72,000 people in this area , and we have no food , not even grazing for our animals . Without this , " he gestures toward a long , green tarpaulin piled high with wheat flour , beans and grain , " we would starve and die . " <P> Before the families receive their ration of food , the children are examined by health workers . Their eyes are peered at ; their skin is checked . The aides take measurements of each child . If he or she is too small , it can be a sign of chronic malnourishment . Danish Nutritionist Birthe Pedersen , who works for the International Committee of the Red Cross , is measuring an eight-year-old boy . The upper part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal child 's arm is about 15 cm . After the boy walks away , Pedersen looks grim . " He will not live very long , " she says . <P> Three years ago , a famine began to strike Ethiopia with apocalyptic force . Westerners watched in horror as the images of death filled their TV screens : the rows of fly-haunted corpses , the skeletal orphans crouched in pain , the villagers desperately scrambling for bags of grain dropped from the sky . What started out as a trickle of aid turned into a billion-dollar flood . The U.S. , the largest donor , sent $500 million , and that does not include millions in private contributions . Irish Rocker Bob Geldof enlisted the help of his fellow musicians , dubbed his crusade Band Aid and raised $140 million . The rescue effort was plagued by delays and controversy , and some 1 million Ethiopians eventually died . But more would have perished if the world had not responded so generously .                 @ @ @ @
