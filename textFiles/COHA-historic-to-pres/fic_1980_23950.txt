PAPA TAKES A BRIDE A short story by Noriko Sawada HEN PAPA , mustachioed and fierce , like Pancho Villa , sent Mama his picture and commenced an exchange of letters , object matrimony , he never thought to mention that he had had four wives already and that she would be his fifth . And when Mama responded with a studio portrait of herself , her pale face framed by a pompadour and big puffs covering her ears , she forgot to tell him that she was the unwed mother of a seventeenyear-old son . Papa was married first when he was twenty-four . Matsu was seventeen . When he closed his eyes , her face blurred into the features of his subsequent wives , whose photographs he had more recently held in his hand . More vividly he remembered the drought , the sun daily searing his stunted crops of barley , rice , and sweet potatoes . He saw his widowed mother 's bent figure praying for rain , and heard at sunset the drone of her sutras and the tinkle of her bell skimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough ; only Matsu 's face eluded him . He had parted her clothes when the growl of his stomach had caused him to cough and her to giggle . He had rejoiced in his maleness that breathless night , the sweat from his body viscous against hers , the broken tatanti scratching his knees . When languor dulled his hunger pangs , he had fallen asleep to the metallic hum of the cicadas . And when hunger broke his slumber , he had had the strength to gather Matsu in his arms once more . The clouds were stingy the following year , too . Papa 's farm yielded less than it had the summer before . His first-born took sick and whimpered at Matsu 's dry breast , for there was no relative to wet-nurse him . Matsu boiled barley and fed him the broth . After seven days he ceased his relentless wailing and died . Papa was enraged by Matsu 's dejection , the accusation of failure in her eyes . Hungry himself and numb with grief , he let her know that nothing she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , " he shouted . " I ca n't control the weather . Do you think I deliberately let our son die ? " Next year , when most of the men had gone to the city to seek work and the girls had been sold to geisha houses , a recruiter had come and told Papa about California , a land rich in gold and opportunity . Papa agreed to go , promising Matsu that he would work hard there for three years  --  five at the most save his money , and come home a wealthy man . He would bring honor to the name of Kato , and no one in his family would ever want for rice . Matsu wept when Papa climbed into the horsecart for the trip through the mountains to the railhead , Kumamoto City . He carried his lunch and clothing tied in two cloth bundles . Matsu 's cry , " We 'll meet again , " more a plea than a prophecy , followed him during his train ride to Yokohama and three weeks in steerage to San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first he sent Matsu $5 monthly , then with diminishing frequency , dribbling away to nothing by the end of the year . T HEY NEVER DID meet again . Almost all of Papa 's first two months ' wages went to the recruiter who had advanced his fare . With picks , sledge hammers , shovels , and often with dynamite , he and his gang hacked and bludgeoned a bed to lay the ties and rails of the feeder lines that crisscrossed western America . Papa bore the long hours of hard labor stoically while enjoying an easy comradeship with his fellow laborers . They talked of home , of the five-day New Year 's holiday for which they mashed steamed rice into mochi , a heavy , sticky mass . They tasted their sweat from the exertion of lifting and pounding , lifting and pounding the wooden mallet in cadence to the chanting of the children . They longed for a bite of the fresh rice cake , smooth and yielding like flesh , with its sweet azuki-bean center , for the crunch of salty herring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company of friendly neighbors . Before the drought Papa 's mother had cooked all night on New Year 's Eve , her specialty the sea-bream broiled to look as if it were moving , with its tail lifted and displayed on a bed of slippery seaweed . The men yearned most for a hot bath to wash away the dirt and stickiness in summer and to dispel their soreness in winter . They slept in a boxcar fitted with bunks . It smelled of urine and vomit . They teased one another about the frumpy blonde they straddled on payday . They disparaged their diet of pork and beans and joked about their flatulence . They played " Flowers , " slapping down the worn cards with decisive yelps of " Ya-re ! " Do it ! and shoving coins and bills across the table . Each morning they bet one of their group that he could not escape the eye of the foreman for the entire day and thus avoid work altogether . They particularly admired the scholar among them who quadrupled his income by signing up under four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance each time by borrowing another 's coat , hat , or muffler . Twice a month for six years Papa gambled , drank , and whored away his pay in towns between San Francisco and Denver , Cheyenne , and Seattle , and in tents where there were no towns . Before his contract expired , the contractor arrived to sign him to another . Penniless , Papa complied . Ashamed that he could send no money , he did not write to Matsu . Then Papa dropped a pickax on his foot and it became infected . His severance pay was a one-way ticket to San Francisco . He hobbled from the station to the Kumamoto Hotel , where he stayed until he was well enough to work again . During his idleness Papa thought about how his usually solicitous hotelkeeper had turned snippy , had served him neither rice nor tea , and had ignored his entreaties for a doctor . Papa realized that he might have died there , with no one to care , no one to mourn him . Humiliated that he had had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave his gold watch as security , Papa vowed never to be destitute again . Papa gave up his wicked ways and saved his money , working harvests along the Central Valley down into southern California . When he returned to the hotel four years later to settle his bill and retrieve his watch , he met a member of his gang who had quit the railroad after two years and had taken up farming in Santa Barbara . He suggested that Papa might want to settle there too . That is how Papa came to live alone in a frame shack alongside a bathhouse and toolshed that he had built himself . The olive orchard and vegetable farm that he leased were productive , but he ached for companionship . He wanted a wife . W MI $50 HE opened a savings account at the First National Bank and added to it regularly . In four years Papa 's abundant crops , hard work , and frugal living enabled him to save $1,000. the sum the Immigration Service required of a man wishing to summon a bride from Japan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least to give her a few dollars after he had sent neither word nor money for so long . For Papa , who could read at only a second-grade level , could barely sign his name and do sums , producing a letter was a two-day undertaking . On Saturday , as soon as it grew light , Papa watered and fed his horse and threw a double measure of cracked corn at his unpenned chickens . He washed himself at the pump , rinsed his mouth , and filled the kettle . While the tea steeped , Papa stropped his razor , steamed his face , lathered , and shaved . He cooked a pot of rice and had some with his tea . He wet and salted his palms , made four rice balls , placed them in a saucer , and covered them with a damp cloth . He strode to the toolshed and , holding his breath , opened the door and stepped in . The stench flattened him against the wall . Squar-ing his shoulders , he plunged his hand into a wooden tub and withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ran it through the " 0 " of his forefinger and thumb and wiped off the excess miso . He rinsed his hands and the radish at the pump . Returning to the house , he sliced eight even daikon rounds and added them to the rice balls . His lunch was ready . He harnessed his horse and hitched up the wagon . Under the seat he placed his lunch and the Gladstone bag holding his shaving gear and underwear . For his horse he carried oats and a half bale of hay . Changing into his black covert cloth suit , Papa knotted his string tie , laced up his shiny black shoes , and clapped a grey fedora on the back of his head . He drove two hours over tar-paved roads to the City of Santa Barbara , stopping once in the shade of a pepper tree to eat his lunch . After he watered his horse at the public trough and secured him at the rail , Papa clumped up the stairs to the Japanese Hotel above a Chinese laundry . The odor of soy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not speak to Mr. Nakamura , the professional letter writer , who was murmuring to a man seated opposite him . Papa greeted the innkeeper , who handed him a key . Papa left his bag and hat in his room , locked the door , and returned to the lobby . He said , " Y a , shibaraku , " It 's been a while with a jerky bow and joined two farmers like himself occupying chairs along the wall . Mr. Nakamura looked up , nodded , and resumed writing . Papa sat back and waited . In time Mr. Nakamura motioned for him to move to the patron 's chair . Papa explained that he wanted Matsu to come to America , said her address out loud , and Mr. Nakamura wrote for ten minutes . He read the letter to Papa , who nodded and gave him $3 . Mr. Nakamura thanked him and told Papa that a reply would come to his RFD mailbox . He filled out a form and handed it to Papa with the unsealed , stamped letter . Papa drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line and gave the application and $25 to the clerk , who handed him back change and the money order . Papa placed it inside the envelope , sealed and posted it . Twenty dollars , or Y40 , a fair sum for 1910 , half of which was for his mother , was on its way to Matsu . Papa fed his horse and had dinner alone at the chop suey house on the corner . At eight o'clock he ended his small talk with the innkeeper , bathed in the tub down the hall , and went right to sleep . In the morning he saw to his animal , ate rice and miso soup , and checked out . He reached his farm at mid-afternoon , changed his clothes , and unhitched and unharnessed his horse . He ate his lunch in three gulps with a swallow of cold tea and hurried to join his field hands . HREE MONTHS later he visited Mr. Nakamura with Matsu 's reply . Papa 's letter had been a big shock to her . Believing him to be dead after six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had had her name removed from the Kato family registry and married a neighboring farmer , a widower with four young children . Matsu thanked Papa for the money . She had not delivered the sum designated for his mother because she had died two years ago . What should she do with it ? Papa chose not to answer . He figured she would keep it , and that was all right with him . Insulated by distance , he was scarcely touched by happenings in Japan . He felt no stab of loss , no bitterness that the woman he had counted on to quell his loneliness was now someone else 's wife . But he mourned the loss of his mother . He wished he could have sent her money and made her comfortable the last years of her life . She would have been proud of him . Papa told Mr. Nakamura that he did not blame Matsu for what she had done . After all , he had abandoned her . Now that she was not available , Papa still wanted a bride from Kumamoto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Papa paid him $10 . When three months had nearly expired , Papa occasionally went to his mailbox before the noontime delivery . A letter from Japan finally arrived . Papa put on his glasses , slit the envelope , and scrutinized the picture of Kimi , a slim , almost skinny , winsome woman . Although he could puzzle out a phrase here and there , he needed Mr. Nakamura to read her letter in its entirety . She wrote : Most revered Mr. Kato , The cherry petals that lie like snow on the surface of rain puddles are bruised by the clogs of children on their way to school . Until your proposal , my own petals also floated in the mud . I felt as though destiny had passed me by as the last of ray classmates was spoken for five years ago . My parents are relieved and agreeable , so I gratefully accept your offer of marriage . I swear that the enclosed photograph , taken on the occasion of my twenty-second birthday , is a picture of me and not of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of Kyoko , my beautiful sixteen-year-old sister , and sent it as her own to her husband-to-be . He replied that he never dreamed he would wed such a gorgeous woman . She departed for Sacramento last month . If it is not too far , I would like to visit Wakako when I come to America to be your wife . Please take care of your health . Respectfully yours , Uyeno Kimi Papa approved of Kimi and asked that her name be added to his family roster . That constituted a binding marriage . Ordinarily Kimi would have moved in with Papa 's parents for six months before applying for a passport . But because they were no longer alive , she lived at home . Kimi wrote that she would book passage on the next vessel . Papa sent her $100 for trousseau and steerage . Her next letter was apologetic and sorrowful . In Yokohama she had tested positive for trachoma and had been refused entry . Papa was disappointed and replied that she should keep as consolation whatever funds she had remaining . Immediately Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That constituted divorce and cost Papa $10 . Later he paid Mr. Nakamura $10 more when he sent off another request for a bride . Toyo charmed Papa with sprightly letters but did not agree right away to marry him . Papa sat for a new photograph to change his luck . After two exchanges Mr. Nakamura 's literary talents were taxed , for Papa had run out of things to tell Toyo . H ow COULD he describe his farm and the work it involved when he could hardly explain them to Mr. Nakamura ? There was the plowing , the planting . the weeding and spraying , the fertilizing , the irrigating , and the harvesting  --  the feverish harvesting when it looked like rain . How could he tell her about broadcasting mustard seeds for a cover crop which shimmered golden before he plowed it under in May ? About gathering and washing olives and curing them in barrels of brine that took up all the floor space in his tiny shack and filled it with a repugnant smell ? What words could express his satisfaction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement when he picked the season 's first shiny red strawberry , cool and half-hidden under dark green leaves ? Or his rage at the chartreuse hornworms four inches long and as thick as his thumb that , unintimidated by his presence , continued to audibly munch on his tomato vines and blossoms ? Or the passion with which he flung them on the ground and squashed them with his heel ? He wondered how Toyo , a city girl , would adapt to farm life with just him for company , their isolation broken only by an occasional trip to town . Except for infrequent weddings and after-funeral get-togethers at the Chinese restaurant . he could offer no festivals , no theater , no social life . All he could guarantee was hard work , food , and shelter . He did not raise any of these concerns with her . Personality was important , but Papa wanted of Toyo a wife , not a pen pal . He told her so in his third letter , whereupon she consented to wed Papa : thus hers became the latest name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the customary $100 for new clothes and passage . Toyo responded with an anguished account of her father 's gall bladder attack , his enormous doctors ' and hospital bills , which Papa 's generosity had barely covered . Papa sent her another $100 by return mail . Toyo replied that she must have been born under an unlucky sign . Her mother had been felled by a mysterious illness and Papa 's remittance had again been timely . She enclosed a note of extravagant thanks from her parents in which they addressed him as Son . Papa wondered whether Toyo had ever intended to come . Perhaps she was just leading him on . Mr. Nakamura could not advise him . Papa then decided to test her by sending her only $20 . " I myself underwent an emergency appendectomy , " Toyo wrote , and your meager money order covered only the cost of my medicines . Please send $50 for the doctor and $100 more for clothes and passage . " She sent a new photograph showing her profile and the nape of her neck . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa for bringing adventure into her dull life and promised to take the next boat . Papa was torn . He had already invested almost two years and $300 in Toyo , not counting the cost of his own photograph . He took a deep breath and sent $150 with an ultimatum . Her response took five months and crossed with Papa 's demand that she at least acknowledge receipt of the money . She did not name a departure date . She mentioned female disorders which she said she needed to attend to before she left Japan . Papa understood , because for those problems she should have a doctor who spoke her language . She was Papa 's wife and her place was with him , Toyo declared , but fate was against her . For the first time she did not ask for money . Papa felt discouraged . No closer to America than she had been at the outset , Toyo might never get there . Or worse , Papa shuddered , she might arrive and , in view of her ailments and fragile constitution , fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Nakamura to have her name stricken . Mr. Nagamura jotted down Papa 's instructions . He then read aloud from the local Japanese newspaper , dated January 19 , 1918 , that Congress would soon pass the Japanese Exclusion Act , which would stop the flow of immigrants in 1920 . Papa then swore that he would overlook any imperfections that marred his next bride , if only she would come on the first possible vessel . " After all , " he reasoned , " I am middle-aged now and not without faults myself . " ANA WAS twenty and comely . Papa 's morale rose . He accordingly signed all the papers and mailed the money . However , her reply caused Mr. Nakamura alternately to cough and clear his throat for three minutes . Pausing twice to compose himself , lie read Hana 's conjecture about the number of times she and Papa would unite their first night together and about the size and length of Papa 's member . " I squirm nightly in anticipation of surrender , " Mr. Nakamura squeaked . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My pliant body awaits your touch . " Papa blushed and Mr. Nakamura studied his Waterman pen . Papa glanced up several times before their eyes met and held . Their faces began to twitch . They gritted their teeth . It was no use . They exploded . They laughed so loud the innkeeper came to see what was happening , but they could not stop long enough to tell him . Limp and tearful , intermittently convulsed by aftershocks , the men returned to the business at hand . Without discussion they knew that Papa would have to forgo the pleasure of rousing Hana , for once ignited he would surely lose her to one of the many single men who constituted the majority of the Japanese population  --  men too poor to send for brides themselves . Papa , now forty-five , saw himself , club in hand , standing guard over Hana and rejected that image . Besides , single-minded lust was not among the traits Papa believed essential for a wife . Despite his vow to summon his next wife uncritically and his awareness that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed Mr. Nakamura to have Hana 's name erased . And this time he asked for a mature woman of at least thirty-five . Mama , who met Papa 's age requirement all right , did not hesitate when he proposed . She accepted at once . Mama wrote that even though she had been raised a merchant 's daughter , she was willing to toil on Papa 's farm . She liked the idea of tending and watching things grow . Papa confessed that he had had only two years of schooling . Since he did not mention Mr. Nakamura and his letters belied his assertion , Mama smiled at Papa 's modesty and fell in love with her self-educated husband . Mama 's father , happy to be rid of her , urged that she wait to tell Papa in person about her past . He argued that if he knew , he would divorce her . That was why she did not take up her brush to tell him . But her deceit clawed at her conscience . Mama was past the age when women first marry because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as miserable a plight for a woman to have endured in 1901 rural Japan as anywhere , anytime in history . She had been sixteen when her silhouette trumpeted her blunder . From then on she had no haven from the snickering of schoolgirls , from chattering housewives falling silent at her approach to the market , from the lewd suggestions of men beneath her class who thrust themselves upon her in narrow lanes . She had expected to live out her life as the town pariah , her guilt a glowing excrescence on her brow . Now , like magic , catcalls no longer defiled the air she breathed . Her hangdog expression changed to one of defiance . At long last Mama indulged in all the delicious daydreams of tender love and domesticity up to then denied her . In a community ignorant of her folly she would attain respectability as the wife of a wealthy farmer . Afterward , identifying him as her brother , she would send for her son , a lad of seventeen who was terrified of people . Mama imagined that America and Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T WO DAYS before Mama 's ship was due , Papa drove to Santa Barbara to take the train to San Francisco . He called on Mr. Nakamura and gave him two quarts of black olives . They recalled that their letter writing had spanned ten years and relived their see-saw experiences with Matsu . Kirni , and Toyo . The name Hana drew a smile . Mr. Nakamura praised Papa for his perseverance and congratulated him on his success . They shook hands . When Papa started down the stairs , Mr. Nakamura cried . Papa got to the cavernous pier at six in the morning and joined other Japanese men who were smoking and shuffling about . Through the fog the ship became distinct . It groaned twice . The last to disembark , the women in steerage crowded the rails . Since Papa could not make out which one was Mama , he waved exuberantly at all of them . At one end of the dock the officers of the Japanese Association , wearing white arm bands , hurried the women through the immigration and customs procedures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section for detention at Angel Island , huddled together , anxious and fearful . their sleeves damp with tears . An hour expired before the president called out the name of the first bride from the list in his hands and her husband came up to claim her . Presently , Papa heard " Kato , Michiko , wife of Kato , Kamejiro . " Papa stepped forward , removed his hat , and bowed , arms stiff at his sides . Mama bowed lower . They spoke at the same time , " Hajime mashite yoroshiku " Our first meeting , I beseech your good will , except Mama added feminine flourishes and took longer to finish . While inquiring about her trip , Papa studied Mama curiously . Clear-skinned and handsome , she stood two inches shorter than his own five feet . When she walked . he saw her white socks , her black velvet thongs and the crimson flicker of her under-kimono . He approved of her outer garment of plum crepe cinched with an obi of silvery brocade . Mama answered that she had been seasick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she had seen that Papa was bald . But what puzzled her most was his speech . It was coarse and vulgar , unlike the language he had used in his eloquent letters , letters she had brought with her in a black lacquer box wrapped in aubergine silk . She would figure it out later . When Papa started toward the baggage , Mama hung back . " Come , show me which of these pieces is yours , " said Papa . " Please , before I take another step , I must speak to you and tell you everything . " S O , LEANING against a steamer trunk , Mama delivered the speech she had worked on for nearly a year . It all came out in a rush . She had been the third child , the third girl . Her father had loved his sons and ignored his five daughters , who nonetheless had competed for his attention . Only she had succeeded , by becoming pregnant by the boy next door . Mama spoke of her shame and of her humiliation by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Papa wondered how long it took her to arrange her hair . He wanted to watch her comb and puff it out . He wanted to touch it . Papa listened and thought of his years of loneliness . He counted the times he had opened his mail box , the visits and fees he had paid Mr. Nakamura , and the money he had mailed to his brides . One by one he ticked them off , his inaccessible or unsuitable wives . He would tell Mama about them later . But now , miraculously , Mama was really here ! Right here in San Francisco , California , U.S.A. ! Papa wanted joyously to strut the length of the pier crowing , " Look , everybody , she is here ! My wife , Michi , is here ! " Instead he said , " You have no idea how long I have waited . " " Yes , it was a long voyage , " acknowledged Mama and pressed on with her confession . " I beg your forgiveness for having lied to you . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have no excuse  --  only that I was desperate to get away and begin a new life . Now you know . Not only am I blemished , I am encumbered with a son I hope to summon . " Mama stopped . She had - xpected him to erupt in indignation , accuse her of trickery , and spurn her . Accustomed to rejection , she steeled herself for an icy " in view of your deception , I must ask you to go home . " Instead , Papa was grinning like a fool . Maybe he was simpleminded , she thought . More likely drunk . No , he had written that he was a teetotaler . She continued with her speech : " If you will allow me to stay , I promise to work hard and be faithful . The decision of course is yours . But if you do not want me , I will bear you no rancor and take the next ship back . " Papa suppressed a scream . " What spunk , " he thought . Just as Mama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a future of some promise , she was risking it all by confessing to something that had happened eighteen years ago . He wished she were n't so intense about her guilt . It mattered so little . He was happy . No matter what she had done in the past , Papa wanted to keep Mama and make the best of it . He was even willing to send for her son , a grown man . He wanted to give her a chance . He wanted a chance himself . Papa leaned forward . " Michi , " he said , " it 's all right . You can stay . I want you to stay . " She stared at him . He spoke her name again , warmly , affectionately , this time the diminutive " Michchan . " Papa reached out but did not touch her . Mama lost her apprehensions and bravado at the same time . She crumpled and bowed her head . She kept it lowered while she fought for composure . When she looked up , Papa was struggling to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
