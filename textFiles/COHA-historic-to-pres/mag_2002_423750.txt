/Jan 2002 Mercury is scarcely visible until the last several days of December , when it creeps above the southwestern horizon about half an hour after sunset . During the first half of January , the planet shows up there more clearly near the end of evening twilight . Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation from the Sun ( 19 ) on January 11 , shining at a moderately favorable magnitude of - 0.6 but fading rapidly to magnitude +0.3 by the 17th and to +1.3 by the 20th . It then swings down in front of the Sun , reaching inferior conjunction on the 27th . Venus briefly appears very low in the east-southeast just before sunrise during the first few days of December . It then moves behind the Sun , reaching superior conjunction on January 14 , and wo n't be readily visible again after sunset until at least late February . Mars moves from Capricornus into Aquarius on December 4 , crossing the meridian at about sunset . Look for it in the southwestern sky during the late evening hours . On the 20th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a month later , on the evening of January 18 , it returns to a similar position . Throughout January , Mars crosses the meridian about an hour before sunset and is visible low in the southwestern sky until about 10:00 PM. local time . Indeed , the red planet sets at nearly this hour until the end of May . As of mid-January , Mars is 149 million miles from Earth and thus presents a rather tiny telescopic disk ( last June , when it was unusually close to Earth , the planet looked four times as large ) . Mars gradually fades from magnitude +0.4 on December 1 to +0.8 on January 1 and finally to +1.0 on January 31 . Jupiter , in Gemini , arrives at opposition to the Sun on New Year 's Day , shining at a dazzling - 2.7 magnitude . In December it rises during evening twilight and remains in the sky all night . By January the planet is already shining in the east when darkness falls ; passing overhead before midnight , it sets before sunup . Jupiter is the silvery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of the Moon on the evening of December 2 . The planet is roughly the same distance above and to the right of the Moon on December 30 but appears much closer by January 26 . Saturn , at opposition , is above the horizon from sunset to sunrise on the night of December 3 , passing north of the bright orange star Aldebaran . Over the course of the month , it appears to move westward several degrees . Approaching perihelion ( on July 26 , 2003 ) with its rings tipped 260 to our line of sight , Saturn shines at magnitude - 0.5 , the brightest it has been in nearly three decades . During January , Saturn is well up in the eastnortheast at dusk ; by month 's end , it sets in the west-northwest at about 3:00 A.M. local time . Observers in the continental United States and parts of southern Canada get to see a nearly full Moon occult Saturn on December 28 at about 4:05 A.M. in the East and at roughly 12:15 A.M. local time on the West Coast . For Hawaii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The Moon is at last quarter on December 7 at 2:52 P.M. and new on the 14th at 3:47 PM . First-quarter Moon falls on the 22nd at 3:56 P.M. On December 30 the Moon is full at 5:41 A.M. ; a few minutes earlier , the Moon is partially eclipsed , resulting in a brief , slight darkening of its lower rim at 5:29 A.M. In January , last  --  quarter Moon comes on the 5th at 10:54 PM. , new Moon on the 13th at 8:29 A.M. , first quarter on the 21st at 12:46 PM. , and full Moon on the 28th at 5:50 PM . On January 14 the sliver of a very young Moon hovers less than 60 below Mercury in the west-southwest . The following evening , it is well to the east of Mercury and much easier to spot . The Geminid meteor shower promises a fine display , at least for those willing to brave the chill . These meteors can be seen all night long for a week or so , with no Moon to spoil the view with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through morning , when a Geminid meteor should burst across the sky about every minute , especially in the predawn hours . Past displays have featured a richness of both fireballs and faint meteors but have included fewer objects of medium brightness . The meteors appear to originate near the bright star Castor , in Gemini . The Sun will undergo an annular , or ring-shaped , eclipse on December 14 . The eclipse path first strikes Earth over the middle of the Pacific Ocean . Heading east , it passes 300 miles south of the Hawaiian Islands , producing an 84 percent eclipse over Honolulu at 9:27 A.M. Hawaiian time . Veering northeast , the path goes over parts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica , where the Sun will mimic a dazzling ring of fire near sunset . Over most of the United States-except for upstate New York , portions of New England , and Alaska-a partial solar eclipse will be visible . Depending on your location , between 1 and 40 percent of the Sun 's diameter may be covered , with the greater coverage visible toward the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eclipse is finished , but the western half of the country has an uninterrupted view . Earth reaches perihelion-at 91,402,515 miles , the point on its orbit nearest the Sun-at 9:00 A.M. on January 2 . Unless othenise noted , all times are given in Eastern Standard Time . <p>
