LONDON , Dec. ** questions raised in Communist China 's economic and political relations with Russia indicate that although the Chinese-Soviet alliance is the basis of China 's foreign policy , it is at times a somewhat wobbly one . Reports reaching Government and other interested agencies in this capital do not tell of any decisive division between the two Communist colossi . Nor do they see now , or in the future any indications that Titoist independence of Moscow is endemic among the Chinese Communist chieftans . However , there are numerous questions that seem to irritate both . sides , and a smaller number of issues that apparently strike either Moscow or Peiping as infringements of the national interests of Russia and China . For despite the propaganda , the alliance is viewed as a pact between two great sovereign states with common goals and enemies , rather than a fraternal association of Communist nations .

The emphatic warnings in the Communist press that China must , rely on her own resources , experts say , are an admission that the eco-I nomic aid promised by the Soviet ' Union is not reaching China in sufficient quantities or soon enough . Both China and the Soviet Union are . large and ambitious empires . Their geographical ? ambitions clashed when China announced her , intention of establishing Chinese " military colonies " populated by veterans in Sinkiang and Manchuria . Similarly , the Russians were not impressed with Chinese , hints of condominium in some parts of Turkestan . Not all the problems are on the Chinese side of the alliance .

But the Russians also are firm believers in the truth of Lenin 's dictum that an alliance of China . India and Russia will be of decisive importance in the world struggle between communism and capitalism . Since the Communist triumph in China , millions of young Chinese have been sent to the Soviet Union for technical , political and military training . Grim as life is in the working quarters of those cities , one dispatch says , it is a great deal brighter than life in the villages of interior Chink . The conclusion is that the program is doing a good deal to balance some of the differences that have arisen between the two Governments . The influence of the program is shown by the almost slavish manner in which the Chinese industrial proletariat welcomes the propagandist trappings of Russian industrialization , such as the Stakhanovite system of individual over-production and the contests in " Socialist output " between factory and factory . Yet none of this eases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Governments over the Korean war . Here again the investigator in Peiping or Moscow enters uncharted territory . There are few factual proofs of this issue . But the tendency of experts in these matters is to believe that late in 1952 the Soviet Union began to reduce the amount of material aid it was sending to the Chinese armies in Korea . This reduction may have been a result of any one of several reasons : the need to retool Russian arms factories , particularly those making the T-34 tank , whose first model appeared in 1938 ; the Soviet hesitation to throw more materiel into what the Soviet high command judged a drawn battle , and Russia 's increased preoccupation with her own western defenses as a result of the steady growth of Western strength in Europe . Another reason for the Soviet reduction may have been a suspi-a cion that all the arms sent to China were not being supplied to the armies in Korea , but some was being diverted to build up the over-all military strength of China .
