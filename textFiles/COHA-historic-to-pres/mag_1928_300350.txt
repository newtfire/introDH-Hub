The youngest member of Congress is George Hamilton Combs Jr. , a minister 's son from Missouri . Now aged 29 , he represents the 367,846 inhabitants of Jackson County . He is a Democrat . Last week he arose in the House to make one of his infrequent speeches . It was a speech addressed to his fellow Democrats , whom he flayed roundly for their post-election faultfinding with National Democratic Chairman John J. Raskob . <P> Youngest Democrat Combs had this much to say : " For eight years we Democrats have been wobbling along without leadership and without clearly visioned policy . For the first time in eight years the Democratic party has had vitality , it has had aggressiveness , it has had that which makes for an intelligent and for an aggressive campaign leadership . I do not believe that any of us feel that the business man has any monopoly on virtue , or that a man taken from the ranks of business is necessarily holier or more pious than the man who comes from the ranks of politics , yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous disservice if we penalize every man who seeks to render an honorable and disinterested service by criticizing him for those acts which he undertakes in the public weal . "
