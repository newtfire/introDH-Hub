Mothers ' Day is not in France an occasion for bestowing bonbons , greeting cards or bouquets upon any and every mother . With Latin thrift and logic only especially meritorious mothers are honored-by the State . <P> Last week the celebration of French Mothers ' Day climaxed at Paris when the City Council bestowed 80 medals upon ladies from whom ten or more offspring have been begotten . French Royalists pointed pridefully to three titled medal winners : the Countesses Caruyer de Beauvais , Fremy-Elphege and Le Lasseur . <P> In the rural French departments Mothers ' Day was also Orphans ' Day and kindly bakers observed it by giving one sugar cake each to children whom they positively knew to be orphans .
