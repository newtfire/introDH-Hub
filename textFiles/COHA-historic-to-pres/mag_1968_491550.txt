Saturday POST Evening HOW BOBBY PLANS TO WIN IT I f we come roaring out of California , nothing will stop us in Chicago . " The speaker , a top Kennedy campaign strategist , was wolfing his **30;3046;TOOLONG in the motel coffee shop in San Jose . He was eating very fast because Robert F. Kennedy campaigns for President of the United States very fast , and the motorcade was about to leave for the airport . What the Kennedy man was talking about was California 's June 4 primary and its big . winnertake-all package of 174 delegate votes : If Kennedy could win an impressive percentage of the California vote , according to the strategy , he would get the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August . " What we 're doing is changing the rules , " he explained to me . " We take the position that the old rules do n't apply . America is in flux , everything is changing . The old way of delegate-hunting does n't apply . We 're going to the people . And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that simple , and the Kennedy organization was not about to neglect the delegates ( indeed it has elaborate machinery at its downtown Washington headquarters , eight blocks from the White House , to keep track of them ) . But what the Kennedy man was saying had a good deal of truth in it too . From the beginning Senator Kennedy and his high command knew that they had to change the rules if there was to be any chance of victory in Chicago . Bobby had to stir the people , to touch them and be touched by them , to lose his cufflinks , his shoes and his voice , to make the adrenaline flow , to draw enormous , excited crowds . to run a campaign so exhilarating , so electric and so powerful that its message would be clear to even the dullest state political leader : Bobby is a winner ; if you do n't take Bobby in Chicago , your local ticket will be hurt in November ; hop aboard before it 's too late . California , the last of the big primaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Henry Cabot Lodge in New Hampshire four years ago , and to Nelson Rockefeller in Oregon . But he narrowly edged Rockefeller in California and won the nomination . Last March , 10 days before Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota won his big vote in New Hampshire , Jesse M. ( Big Daddy ) Unruh , the most powerful Democrat in California , received the results of a political poll of the Golden State taken by John Kraft . It showed Robert Kennedy defeating both President Johnson and Senator McCarthy . Fred Dutton , former aide to California 's Governor Pat Brown , and Kenneth P. O'Donnell , Bobby 's long-time friend and political adviser , flew to Washington to urge Kennedy to run for President . Both had previously been opposed to it . And Jesse Unruh became the first big national Democratic figure publicly to repudiate Lyndon Johnson . " WHAT MAKES BOBBY RUN ? " The sign in Republican Monterey , Calif. , was hostile , so Kennedy disarmed them with the Teddy button story : " I had asked my younger brother , Edward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . But when he put them on the plane , they all had his picture on them . ( Laughter . A pause . ) I told him it was to late for him to gel into the campaign . ( Another pause . ) And anyway that people would say he was ruthless . " More laughter . ) Jesse Unruh stood next to Bobby , clinically watching the crowd reaction . He is the speaker of the State Assembly , a lough wheeler-dealer who came to California from West Texas . " Big Daddy " has lost weight but not clout . He has a rubber face , a normally downturned mouth that makes him look like the tragedy mask in a Greek drama . Back aboard the jet , Unruh was sweating profusely . He mopped his forei " .

Kennedy over the top on the first ballot. , the pandemonium that broke loose on the floor of the Sports Arena was a great television event . But the nomination had been locked up weeks before , in the back rooms , and in the hills of West Virginia , by the smoothly running campaign machine managed by Robert F. Kennedy . By contrast , in 1968 Bobby did not plunge into the race until March 16 , a full two-and-a-half months later than his brother bad declared in 1960 . Instead of running a single-minded and highly organized machine , Bobby was surrounded by advisers sharply divided over the wisdom of his making the race at all . Unlike his brother . Robert Kennedy at the outset was seeking to wrest the nomination from an incumbent President , something that had not been accomplished for 84 years . Robert Kennedy had to launch a revolution from a jet plane . He had to organize a staff , campaign in the primaries and map his grand strategy , all at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . Even as he was attempting to assemble an organization , events moved so rapidly as to threaten his ability to deal with them . But they came , flocking to Bobby 's banner with amazing speed , converging on Washington , fanning out over the nation , answering the call of the Kennedy mystique , the Kennedy glamour , sensing the chance of power regained . From the carpeted law offices of lower Manhattan and Washington . from obscure corners of New York and Massachusetts . they came . Bobby was even able to reach into Lyndon Johnson 's cabinetafter-L.B.J. had announced he would not run again  --  and pluck out Postmaster General Lawrence F. O'Brien , whom President Kennedy once called " the best election man in the business . " They gathered , crammed together at first in Bobby 's offices in the Senate . then , briefly , in the Dodge House , a hotel in the shadow of the Capitol . and finally they moved into 2000 L Street , a new downtown office building . They had come in the hope of picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Restoration . They clasped each other 's hands , men who had not seen each other in five or even eight years , and said . " It 's like old times . " But it wasn't. really , and deep inside they knew that . They had come to remake the dream , but dreams are fragile . " We 'll laugh again , " Pat Moynihan had said after President Kennedy was murdered , " but we 'll never be young again . " The contrast with 1960 showed in little ways too . " Day one . " 1 had scribbled in my notebook . " Skirts are higher . Tuck 's waistline has expanded . " Dick Tuck was a fairly good example . Nobody knew where he had materialized from , but he was back . For Tuck , irreverence is a way of life and politics a sport . He had worked for John Kennedy in 1960 , mostly traveling with Richard Nixon for the explicit purpose of bedeviling the Republican candidate . Later , when Nixon ran for governor of California and visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the banner in the background to read , in Chinese . " WHAT ABOTTT THE HUGHES Toot . LOAN ? " Four years ago he smuggled a girl spy aboard the Goldwater campaign train . Now he was hack , riding the press buses , bustling about on improbable errands , dreaming of ways to slip Kennedy propaganda into Hubert Humphrey 's fortune cookies . They moved into L Street during the last week in March . Money has never been in short supply around the Kennedys , and the space rented on the fifth , sixth and seventh floors is big enough for three simultaneous games- of touch football . The heart of the Kennedy drive for the White House is on the sixth floor . Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has the big corner office . Just as Bobby ran John Kennedy 's campaign eight years ago , Teddy is first among equals in the Bobby campaign . " Teddy is the overall director , but he has no title , " one member of the Bobby team explained . In a clan as closely knit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Kennedy once explained that he had gone into politics because his older brother Joe , who had been killed in World War II . had planned to do so : " And if anything happens to me , Bobby will take over , and if anything happens to him , it will be Teddy . " Physically , and in temperament . Teddy more closely resembles President Kennedy than does Bobby . But as Bobby Kennedy gently points out in his campaign-button story , it is not Teddy 's turn . While Bobby is stirring up the crowds , someone must be wooing the delegates , and that is a significant part of Teddy 's job . He is spending a lot of time moving around the country . talking quietly to local leaders , just as he did in 1960 . And Teddy is his brother 's outrider on Capitol Hill , lining up support among key congressmen and senators . Down the hall from Teddy 's office , in a back room , half a dozen girls sit at desks , working on black loose-leaf notebooks under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bobby 's . This is the political-intelligence center of the Kennedy headquarters . Information from state coordinators flows in hourly to he recorded in the black notebooks . Pressuring and merely keeping track of delegates will be harder for Bobby in 1968 than it was for John F. Kennedy in 1960 . Not only did Bobby get a late start , but the number of votes at the Democratic National Convention has nearly doubled , to 2,6227Certain that the convention would simply be a big party to renominate L.B.J. , Democrats let the number of delegates grow so that as many of the party faithful as possible could go to Chicago to whoop it up . Because some states permit half votes , there may be as many as 5,611 delegates and alternates for the Kennedy machine to keep track of . To win the nomination . Bobby needs 1,312 votes . In the 35 states where presidential primaries are not being held this year . delegates to the national convention are selected by state conventions and state committees . The machinery for choosing the delegates is often enormously complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , would-be delegates must survive an elimination process at meetings at the precinct , county and congressional-district level to make it to Chicago . In many states delegates will not be chosen until next month , making them all the more difficult to corral . But as Teno Roncalio , a Kennedy man in the Rocky Mountain states puts it . " the hunt is on . " Twenty feet from Hackett 's intelligence center is a room equally impenetrable to outsiders . It is commanded by Joseph Gargan , a bespectacled , soft-spoken. 38-year-old lawyer from Milton , Mass . Gargan is in charge of all campaign advancing . When a political candidate goes to , say , Pocatello , Idaho , he does not just show up unannounced . An advance man precedes him by one or several days . The local Democratic organization , if it is favorable to Kennedy . must be contacted . The motorcade route must he selected , the police notified , cars must be arranged , and above all , the time and place of the candidate 's appearance must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the crowds , Gargan 's role obviously takes on extra importance . An advance man for John Kennedy in 1960 , he has one other special qualification for the job . " Joey " Gargan 's mother was Agnes Fitzgerald , sister of Rose Kennedy , Robert Kennedy 's mother , both daughters of John F. Fitzgerald , " Honey Fitz , " Boston 's colorful mayor of half a century ago . Near Gargan 's command post is Theodore C. Sorensen . who put aside a lucrative law practice to come to work for Bobby , just as he had served President Kennedy in the Senate and the White House . Sorensen works closely with Kennedy on delicate questions of high policy and overall strategy . A few doors down is the office of Stephen Smith , who is married to Bobby 's sister Jean . Although Smith shares major overall responsibilities for the organization and direction of the campaign , his chief responsibility is to raise money . Kenny O'Donnell , Harvard teammate of Robert Kennedy and one of the chiefs of the " Irish Mafia , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignments that are seldom publicized . Larry O'Brien . caught between his cabinet post and his deep loyalty to the Kennedys , was liberated by L.B.J. 's withdrawal and plunged into the Indiana primary campaign . quickly taking his place in the top hierarchy of the Bobby organization . Richard Goodwin , White House aide to both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson . jumped over from Gene McCarthy 's staff and joined Bobby early in April . In the seventh floor " think tank " at L Street headquarters are the offices of Milton Gwirtzman , Washington attorney and backstage adviser to Teddy Kennedy , and Peter Edelman , Bobby 's young legislative assistant . In the think tank as well are offices . seldom occupied . for Adam Walinsky , Bobby 's 31-year-old speech writer and adviser . Where Bobby goes , Walinsky and Jeff Greenfield , who is only 24 , fly with him , sparking ideas and pounding out thousands of words that Kennedy stimetimes uses and often does not . They are the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of the Kennedy campaign , and somehow a symbol of it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and witty . Walinsky is so seldom home that recently , while gulping breakfast somewhere on the campaign trail , Greenfield turned to him and announced : " Adam , you 've been declared legally dead , and your wife has remarried , , is seldom there . Mankiewicz , 43 , attempts unsuccessfully to mask a strong streak of idealism behind a show-biz facade , His father , the late Herman Mankiewicz , was co-author of the original screenplay of Citizen Kane. and his uncle is Joseph L. Mankiewicz , the writer and director . Mankiewicz left his Beverly Hills law practice in 1961 to become a Peace Corps official under Sargent Shriven , then joined Bobby two years ago . Next door , also working with the news media , is the indomitable Pierre Salinger , who was press secretary for President Kennedy , and , briefly , for President Johnson . Apparently acting on the sound theory that one controversial hair style is enough for any campaign , Salinger is phasing out his Mississippi riverboat-gambler sideburns . They are sonic of the smartest , toughest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped elect President Kennedy and worked for him in the White House . But Bobby 's organization , because it had to be assembled so hurriedly . is something less than the well-oiled , super-efficient juggernaut that it is often assumed to be . Mistakes have been made , some of them costly . When former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara made television tapes praising Bobby 's coolness during the Cuban missile crisis . the ploy backfired badly . Newspaper editorial writers across the country agreed that the new World Bank president should n't make partisan political statements . Last month one of Gargan 's ace operatives , Donald L. Dell , a Washington attorney and captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team , was accused by an aide to the governor of West Virginia of arm-twisting to arrange a state-police escort for the Kennedy motorcade . Dell was told that an escort was to be provided for Hubert H. Humphrey because he was the incumbent Vice President . but not for Bobby . Allegedly Dell replied : " Well . maybe he 's not going to be an incumbent very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these people down in West Virginia are n't going to be too happy with how you are treated then . " Pierre Salinger was rushed in to issue a half denial of the story and calm everyone . It was not the first complaint from a local politician who has found himself bucking the Kennedy organization . Gordon St. Angelo. state chairman who managed Gov . Roger D. Branigin 's primary campaign in Indiana last month , has declared : " No Kennedy in this family ever lost a race for anything . They do n't run to lose . " The fog was everywhere , clinging to the ground . the buildings . the planes , blanketing John F. Kennedy International Airport and casting doubt on Robert Kennedy 's scheduled 9 A.M. departure on Flight 59 for San Francisco . Bobby was heading west for his first big campaign test . In the week since he had announced his candidacy , he haddrawn enthusiastic college crowds in Kansas , Alabama and Tennessee ; suddenly the Kennedy legend seemed to have come alive again . But this trip to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , where he must win on June 4 . By 10 A.M. the fog lifted enough for the jetliner to take off . It was an odd cargo ; a candidate for President of the United States , reporters . photographers , TV men with their heavy gear . and a few bewildered tourists and businessmen who happened to book seats on the same flight . Over the snow-capped Rockies the sun was glinting off the engine cowls as Flight 59 thundered toward the Golden Gate . The sky was a bright blue , the chill of New York far behind . A fluttery girl passenger approached Mankiewicz at the door of the first-class section to ask if she could get a look at the senator . He had to explain that it was not possible just at that moment . Sen. Robert F. Kennedy , candidate for President of the United States , was sleeping on the floor of the plane At San Francisco , Bobby transferred to a chartered jet and flew into Stockton , in California 's Central Valley . He stood there on a little platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd at the airport , said . " I know God is on your side . " Bobby smiled and answered : " I hope I have some delegates to go with Him . " " I come here to ask for your help , " he began in a voice eerily like his brother 's . " I think we can do better ... and that 's why I 'm running for President of the United States . You give me your help in the next three months , and we 'll win the primary , and we 'll win the election in November , and we 'll have a new day for mankind . " In the town square at Stockton many of the faces in the crowd were Mexican and Filipino  --  fruit pickers and farm laborers . " Decency is the heart of the matter , " he said . " The death and maiming of young men in the swamps of Asia is indecent . For a man to work with his hands in the valley of California with no hope of sending his son to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking here today about putting this country together again . I think we can do better . " Harvard . Boston , Irish and Kennedy . The words , the accent , the pointing motion of the hand , all evoke President Kennedy . In part , at least , this is deliberate . It is weird to hear that voice again , booming out over a sun-drenched town square in the middle of California , on a day that began in the fog at John F A-crzed ) , airport , a continent away . They mobbed him at the shopping center in Sacramento , and for a time it seemed that they might shatter the glass counters in J.C . Penney 's . " Here while the sun shines , men are dying on the other side of the earth . Which of them would have written a symphony ? Which of them would have cured cancer ? Which of them would have played in the World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage ? Those young men in the rice paddies are our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our American life . and that is why I run for President of the United States . " " Sock it to ' em . Bobby ! " someone yelled . Just before sunset the chartered jet swept into San Jose for a buoyant . swinging reception . The air was cool , the mountains green . " ARRIBA KENNEDY ! " read one sign , " ARRIBA ROBERTO , " said another . A mariachi band played Ciellto Linda as Bobby worked his way along the chain link fence . shaking hands . A beaming little Mexican boy was boosted over the crowd to touch him . Stockton had been subdued , Sacramento frenzied , but San Jose was different . The crowd was . and there was no other word for it , happy . The cops could barely restrain the screaming throng in the airport terminal at Los Angeles . It looked a little like a Beatles arrival ; Bobby clearly has star quality . At Griffith Park they tore the place apart . Thousands ran after Bobby 's open car , pummeling him , rocking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on the back of the car , and Bill Barry was gripping him tightly around the knees to keep him from being pulled into the crowd . Barry , a cool ex-FBI man and friend of the senator , never left his side . He had been working as a security official of a Manhattan bank until Robert Kennedy announced he was running . If they mule it to the White I linise , there would be swarms of Secret Service men around Kennedy . But candidates rate no security . In the strange ritual of American presidential is ii tics , there was , for the moment , only Bill Barry . In the mob . a baby , bleeding from the nose , was thrust into the photographers car ; only a miracle saved other people from serious injury . Bobby Kennedy was playing his dangerous game with the crowds , dangerous to his own safety and that of others . To be nominated , he must create a winner psychology . He was going over the heads of the delegates , to the people . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceded . But he added grimly : " It 's going to be done . " At Watts , Bobby spoke at the corner of Graham Avenue and 103d Street . The crowd was mostly for him , but there were some skeptical and hostile black faces too . " I want hatred and prejudice to disappear from this country , " he said . " I pledge to you that when a young man goes to Vietnam to light , when he comes back to the United States he will be treated with justice . " ( Cheers . ) Chris Bryant Sr. , a retired cleaner and presser from Watts , his face lined with the burdens of 71 years . squinted up in the sunlight at Kennedy . " Yeah . I 'm votin ' for him . " " Because he 'll do something for Watts ? " " Not just for It " alls . I 'm not just puffin ' for Walls , I 'm pouf ' for the whole country . I 'd like to see somebody pull the country out . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the political people I talked to . Kenny O'Donnell , my brother , Ted Sorensen . Fred Dutton , all said ' do n't do it . ' But my sisters and the people who were not in politics at all said to go ahead and do it . " We were ( lying from Los Angeles to Portland , and the candidate was cutting into a bland airline steak . I noticed that the blond hair , so thrilling to teen-agers and so irritating to their elders , is now flecked with gray . " I really had three choices , " he said . " Stay neutral , support Lyndon Johnson . which I could n't do , or support Gene McCarthy for President of the United States , which I did not want to do . " To be sitting on the sidelines , he said , seemed " unreal . " " If I had n't gone in , I would have had to make speeches for McCarthy and get in deeper and deeper doing things I did n't believe in . " Senator McCarthy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race for the nomination . feel that he is an opportunist  --  that he came in only after McCarthy , in New Hampshire , had demonstrated Johnson 's weakness . The Kennedy version is different : " I had more or less decided before New Hampshire to run , " Bobby said . " I asked my brother to tell McCarthy . My brother decided , on his own , that he did n't want to tell him in the last days of the primary campaign . So we both talked to Dick Goodwin , who was working for Gene McCarthy , and asked him to tell McCarthy , and he did , on the day before the primary . " ( The message was somewhat diluted by the time it was delivered . however . Teddy Kennedy says his brother spoke to him on Capitol Hill on Thursday , March 7 , five days before New Hampshire . " I was supposed to tell Gene that Bob was very much considering running . There was some question of whether I would be the best one to tell him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Teddy said he telephoned Goodwin in New Hampshire , and that on either Sunday or Monday . March 10 or 11 . Goodwin reported back that he had relayed the message to McCarthy ; Goodwin had passed along the word- that R.F.K. was considering running  --  during a private talk with McCarthy at the senator 's cottage on the grounds of the Wayfarer Motor Inn in Manchester . ) Could Kennedy overcome resentment among the McCarthy supporters ? " I think so , " he said . " Not all of it . There will be pockets of resentment we wo n't overcome . " Suppose President Johnson brought off a peace settlement in Vietnam ? would n't that neutralize Kennedy 's anti-war stand ? The senator agreed that it might . ' ' One of the things that kept me out one reason I did n't go in was I did n't want to get in a race in which events were controlled by Lyndon Johnson and Ho Chi Minh . " Did he expect to win the nomination ? " Yes . But it will be damn hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Robert Kennedy learned the astounding news nine minutes after the rest of the country . American Airlines Flight 164 from Phoenix . with Bobby and Ethel aboard , was over New York on its final approach to J.F.K. Airport when President Johnson finished speaking at 9:41 P.m. , E.S.T. , March 31 . Bobby was coming home from his nine-day swing through the West . At 9:50 P.M. , the plane taxied to a halt , the door opened , and John Burns , the New York State Democratic chairman , burst in . Bobby was sitting in the front row , by the window on the right . " The President 's not going to run ? " Burns shouted . Kennedy stared at him . " The President 's not going to run ! " Burns yelled again . Bums , a big husky man with horn-rimmed glasses . came up and stood in front of Bobby and tried to repeat what he had just heard President Johnson say on TV . Ethel was wide-eyed . Bobby decided to say nothing publicly until he could find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal building , and as Bobby pushed his way through , a woman screamed , over and over : " You 're our next President . You 're our next President . " There were halos around the lights on the East River Drive in the soft mist of the warm spring night . The black passenger car was moving south toward Robert Kennedy 's apartment at 870 United Nations Plaza . This was to have been the beginning of a monumental effort to deny renomination to an incumbent President . Now , this night at least , it seemed to he all over before it had ever really started . Kennedy was silent on the ride in from the airport . Just once he put his thoughts into words : " I wonder if he would have done it if I had n't come in . " At U.N . Plaza , Bobby , Ethel and Dutton took the elevator to apartment 14F . Sorensen and Walinsky were already there , waiting . The apartment was rapidly tilling : Greenfield , Mankiewicz . Gwirtzman , Arthur Schlesinger Jr. , Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ethel , in a short black-and-white dress , got out a bottle of Scotch and sonic ice and put them on the coffee table . Sorensen began writing out a statement in longhand on a yellow legal pad . Bobby ducked into a bedroom to take a telephone call from Teddy . In room 920 of the ancient Marott Hotel in Indianapolis . Teddy had been watching the President 's speech with David Burke and other aides . I later asked him what his reaction had been that night . " Disbelief , " he said . " I wanted to watch the instant replay . " At the apartment in New York a telegram to the President was being composed 1 n it , Bobby praised Johnson 's decision as " truly inagnan inn a is " and asked for a meeting in the interest of " national unity . " By now it was almost 1 A.M. Through the large windows of the meirtment , overlooking the U.N . and the East River , a few lights still shone hazily through the spring mist . Someone said heartily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " There 's a long way to go , " Bobby answered . Robert Kennedy had not wanted Lyndon Johnson as his brother 's running male at Los Angeles in 1960 . Although Bobby 's role remains a matter of dispute , he had warned Johnson that his selection might touch off a nasty floor . fight . After Jolm F. Kennedy confirmed his choice of Johnson . Bobby is said to have leaned his head against a wall and uttered the controversial line : " lily God , this would n't have happened except that we were all too tired last night . " Later , because Ns brother was President . Bobby enjoyed far more power as Attorney-General than Lyndon Johnson did as Vice President of the United Slates . And Johnson , a proud , sensitive man , had not forgotten Los Angeles . Eight months after Dallas , President Johnson had summoned Bobby to the White House to turn the tables . That meeting on July 29. 1964 , could not have been very far from the minds of the two men when they met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.B.J. had called in three Washington correspondents , and over sherry and lobster , regaled them with his version of how he had broken the news to Bobby : " I told him , ' Bobby . 1 appreciate the fact that you want to perform public service , and 1 think you 've got a great future ahead of you . Bed 1 hare derided that it is Inadvisable el me , to recommend your name to the convention as Vice President . ' And when t said that , he swallowed , " The message from Hanoi came in minutes after Robert Kennedy sat down and faced President Johnson across the polished table in the Cabinet room of the White House . It was 10 A.M. , Wednesday , April 3 , 1968 . That these rivals were meeting at all was nearly as incredible as the contents and the timing of the message that had come from Ho Chi Minh . As Robert Kennedy watched , President Johnson scanned the four-page Teletype text of the Hanoi broadcast . After showing it to Walt W. Rostow , his national-security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message was a long , polemical attack on the United States . But buried near the end was Hanoi 's offer , for the first time , to talk about peace . " Well . it 's a first step , " Bobby commented . Bobby had brought along Ted Sorensen . The President had with him Rostow and White House political aide Charles S. Murphy . For much of the hour-and-a-half meeting the President talked about Vietnam and the partial halt of the bombing . As Bobby sipped tea , and the President nursed an iced soft drink in a tumbler , the talk turned to politics . They admitted they had had their differences . They agreed , politely , that these had perhaps been magnified and hardened by aides and by the press . Kennedy again praised Johnson for his " courageous " decision to pull out . The President said he did not intend to get into the campaign on behalf of any candidate . That did not mean he would remain neutral forever , if he felt it would be for the good of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role for one candidate , he would have run himself . Hubert Humphrey had been a very good Vice President . It was a difficult job , he knew . But the President had no preferences . Harry Truman had made " a spectacle of himself " trying to get Averell Harriman elected President in 1956 , and he was not going to do any such thing . As for his own plans , he would not and could not reconsider and get back in the race . He had always looked at the years since 1960 as a Kennedy-Johnson partnership . He had tried to carry on that partnership . Of President Kennedy , Johnson declared : " I hope he 'll look down and say I did the right thing and fulfilled what he would have wanted me to do for the stockholders . " Kennedy himself maintains that his personal reaction to Johnson 's announced withdrawal was one of " great surprise . " I asked him about it as he was riding out to Washington National Airport one morning last month . Jammed into the back seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . Freckles , a spaniel , Brumus , an enormous black Newfoundland built along the lines of Tony Galento , and Fred Dutton , who regards Brumus with deep suspicion bordering on distaste . " I suppose I was stunned , really , " Kennedy said of L.B.J. 's announcement . Did he think it was a maneuver ? " I thought he meant it . " Kennedy replied . How would the President 's action affect his own strategy ? " It partially changes the nature of the effort , but the only way I 'm going to do it is to go to the people . " Was his first reaction a feeling that the President 's announcement cleared the way for his own nomination ? " No , " he answered . " When Johnson withdrew , I did n't think that it meant anything was certain . because in political life , as in personal life , things change . There are too many variables . No one can predict what will happen next . " Four years ago Robert Kennedy stood before the wildly cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spoke of his brother : When he shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars . And he will make the face of heaven so fine . That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun . In the poignant emotion of that moment , the delegates , had they not already chosen Lyndon Johnson , might have stampeded to Bobby . In 1968 he may fail in his attempt at a Kennedy Restoration and destroy himself in the process . But there will come a moment in Chicago this August when the convention will once again explode in tumult and shouting as it chooses the nominee . This time Robert Kennedy aims to grasp that moment and , like the burden and the glory of the Presidency . make it his .
