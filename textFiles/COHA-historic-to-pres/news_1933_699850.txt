The ? question of a strong official protest to Germany against the decision to declare a moratorium on foreign debts Is being seriously considered at Downing Street , the Monitor learns . There is to be a meeting of bankers here on Tuesday to discuss the situation , when the French are expected to demand modification of the moratorium so as to allow payment of interest on the Dawes and Young loans . There is also the Kospect of a British demarche on the same lines . According to the calculations of a well-Informed authority here , Germany normally needs 80,000,000 Reichsmarks of export surplus monthly In order to secure enough foreign currency to meet the service on foreign indebtedness . The figure was reduced considerably when America went off gold . Moreover , an appreciable part of the Dawes and Young loans , though technically foreign indebtedness , is actually held In Germany , so there is no need to remit currency abroad , thus reducing German 's requirements of foreign exchange still lower . Figures for April show a foreign trade surplus in Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be about the same . It is held , therefore , that Germany ought to be able to meet nearly all its governmental obligations and that a " blanket " moratorium covering all classes of securities is completely unjustifiable . The Times says that " there can be no justification for meting out equal treatment for , say , a first debenture and an income debenture . " Referring specifically to the Dawes loan , The Times points out that this was stated in the prospectus to have " an absolute right of remittance. ** This right , the prospectus added . " shall have priority over remittance of funds required to be remitted in discharge of reparations payments or other liabilities . " Yet advises from Berlin indicate that the moratorium leaves such " other liabilities " as current business transactions unaffected . In these circumstances , when Dr. Willmar Schacht , head of the Reichsbank , comes to London , strong pressure , governmental as well as financial , will be brought to bear on him with a view to getting the moratorium changed .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
