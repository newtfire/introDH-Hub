With the U.S. space program grounded indefinitely by the Challenger tragedy , the Soviet Union demonstrated once again last week that it is strongly forging ahead in space exploration . From the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Central Asia , the Soviets launched the first in a projected series of supply missions to their new manned space station called Mir ( Peace ) . The unmanned cargo vessel Progress 25 , boosted into orbit by a workhorse Proton rocket booster , hooked up on Friday with Mir , bringing food , fuel , water and other supplies to Cosmonauts Leonid Kizim and Vladimir Solovyev , whose own Soyuz T-15 spacecraft docked with the orbiting space station on March 15 . <P> To frustrated proponents of an expanded U.S. space effort , the latest Soviet achievements provoked an old rallying cry . " We 've been Sputniked again , " exclaimed Sandra Adamson , a director of the L5 Society , an organization formed to promote an all-out American effort to colonize and commercialize outer space . Adamson 's reference was to the 1957 Soviet satellite launch , which galvanized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon landing . <P> Such concern is overdrawn . Despite the Challenger calamity , American experts say , in many respects the U.S. space program is still ahead of its Soviet counterpart . Nonetheless , Moscow has racked up a number of major achievements in space over the past 2 1/2 years . Among them : a record 237-day manned flight by three cosmonauts aboard the Salyut 7 space station , a daring repair mission to restart that station after a near total power failure , and a highly sophisticated radar mapping of Venus by two robot Venera probes . Earlier this month the Soviets dazzled the international scientific community with their Vega 1 and Vega 2 inspections of Halley 's comet . Each Vega flyby was preceded by a swing past Venus to drop an instrument-laden balloon into the planet 's dense atmosphere . <P> Then came Mir . On March 13 , the Soviets sent veteran Cosmonauts Kizim , 44 , and Solovyev , 39 , aloft on Soyuz T-15 to activate the space platform , which had been launched into a slightly elliptical 210-mile-high orbit three weeks earlier. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the Soviets have heralded as the first permanently manned space station . According to current estimates , the first comparable U.S. station will not be operational before 1994 . <P> As usual , the secretive Soviets have released little information on the exact specifications of the Mir station or on their long-range plans for its operation . Some scraps of information , however , are available . Mir , which measures 56 ft. by 13 ft. , is 16 ft. longer than the Salyut 7 but only slightly wider . Since the new space station is not intended to house bulky experimental gear , it has much more living space inside . Crew members have separate " cabins , " or cubicles , each equipped with a folding chair , a desk , a mirror and a sleeping bag . The common area of the space station 's living unit features a dining table , a buffet built into a nearby bulkhead , and exercise equipment for the crew . The station is fitted with a large number of portholes , providing views from all four sides of Mir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for viewing the earth 's surface .
