Every morning , the big yellow school bus picks up Susanne Slay , 8 , at her home in suburban Crestwood near St. Louis . The bright second-grader studies hard , plays hard , tackles one hour of homework each night . Why is this surprising ? The daughter of a sales engineer , Susanne is a victim of cerebral palsy , wears heavy braces on both legs . <P> Susanne is one of 1,500 youngsters in the first school district catering entirely to handicapped children . There is nothing similar to it in the U.S. Last week , as the experiment neared the end of its first year , educators from across the nation arrived to inspect and admire it . They agreed that many a U.S. suburb might well copy it . <P> Drive , Drive , Drive . Like many such areas , growing St. Louis County ( pop . 700,000 ) had long slighted handicapped students . Though such children are on the increase ( because of life-saving modern medicine ) , the county was typical in having only a small number out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded youngsters , the physically handicapped simply went to regular schools . Results were poor , sometimes disastrous . <P> When Susanne began first grade in a regular school , only her mother 's iron persistence kept her there . Ruth Slay drove to the school three times a day-once to deliver Susanne , once to help her go to the cafeteria , finally to bring her home . The child made little progress . <P> To solve such problems , the state legislature approved the county 's special district in 1957 . By a 6-to-1 majority , the voters authorized an extra property tax to run it . Purpose : to gather all handicapped students in one public school system , give maximum attention to developing their strongest assets . <P> Shoes &; College . Launched last fall , the new setup ( budget : $1,400,000 ) is run by able , crew-cut Superintendent Morvin A. Wirtz , 40 , a therapy expert with a doctorate in special education . His sprawling domain covers 496 square miles . It has 25 buses that cover 2,500 miles a day , 156 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent tax boost will raise three big buildings . ) Wirtz is also responsible for speech training ( 6,000 students ) in regular schools , but the handicapped are his chief concern . Says he : " We have the potential for developing the best special-education program in the country . " <P> For the first time , 150 children with IQs from 25 to 48 have begun learning simple tasks under the guidance of patient teachers . " I 've seen children eight years old who could n't tie their shoes , " says Wirtz . " Here they learn in two weeks . " Normally intelligent aphasics , unable to speak because of brain damage , have mastered the gift of language . The deaf and the crippled , unable to get proper training before , now get it as a matter of course . For those with orthopedic ailments , such aids as electric typewriters free them to use their minds . Dozens of handicapped children are on the road to college at last .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
