As takeover mania continues to sweep through corporate America , a heated and growing debate has begun to rage along with it . On one side are those who declare that giant mergers and fights for the control of companies have been a boon to the U.S. economy . On the other are critics who contend that the takeover wars have enriched a handful of speculators while crippling target firms and wounding entire industries . <P> It is not a debate of the meek or mild , and in recent weeks the opposing voices have grown increasingly strident . " I think corporate raids are an outrage and a bloody scandal , " says Lane Kirkland , president of the AFL-CIO . " The object is for somebody to make a killing , pure and simple , and I see no virtue in it at all . " Counters Minneapolis Investor Irwin Jacobs , who has made runs at targets as varied as ITT and Disney Productions : " We 're really not a bunch of big , bad wolves . Mergers and acquisitions have created a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week added fresh fuel to the controversy . In Texas , T. Boone Pickens , chairman of Mesa Petroleum , announced an $8.1 billion offer for Unocal , the twelfth largest U.S. oil producer . Pickens and his partners , who announced in February that they were investing in the California company , now hold more than a 13% interest and are seeking majority control . <P> Acquisitors Carl Icahn and Sir James Goldsmith were also on the prowl last week . Goldsmith , who controls Grand Union supermarkets and France 's L'Express magazine , formally offered more than $800 million for up to 70% of Crown Zellerbach , a forest products company that has been fighting off the interloper since December . The day after the Goldsmith proposal , Icahn said he would pay $305 million for 51% of Uni-royal , a tire and chemical manufacturer , which immediately spurned the deal . The moves were only the latest in an increasingly frenzied round of takeover brawls and mergers . Last month Capital Cities Communications agreed to pay $3.5 billion for the American Broadcasting Cos. in what was then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was topped two weeks later when Hospital Corp . of America and American Hospital Supply agreed to a $6.6 billion marriage . Meanwhile , companies ranging from National Distillers to CBS have become rumored takeover targets . Says Felix Rohatyn , a senior partner in the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres : " The takeover game as it is practiced today is really a little like the arms race . You have to stop it before it gets out of control . " <P> The latest merger wave has been the largest in U.S. history when measured in dollars . Inflation-adjusted figures in the Council of Economic Advisers ' current annual report put the value of corporate combinations at $133 billion in 1984 , vs. $112 billion in 1968 , the previous peak year . While there were nearly twice as many mergers in 1968 , the sizes of the transactions were much smaller .
