Chapter OneEVIDENCE BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE WASHINGTON D.C. JUNE 14 , 1960 ( Based on actual transcripts ) " If this agreement is approved , " Senator Aiken said as he tapped out his ash from behind a thick veil of blue cigarette smoke , " Antarctica becomes a country without a government . Of course , it does n't have too much government now , but no government is provided for Antarctica under any conditions in the future ? " Herman Phleger shuffled through his papers and coughed , hoping to cash in on some spit . He failed . It was a hot , humid day . The brass and maple ceiling fans worked overtime . A whiff of freshly cut grass wafted in from the lawn outside . Manicured , the way mankind intended . And Herman Phleger was forced to cough again . " Is there a problem , Mr. Phleger ? " " Uh , yes , sir- " Phleger croaked . He looked around for a clerk . Stood . " Please use the microphone in front of you , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite hear you . " The Senator 's smile to his colleagues was a craggy one . There was a ripple of humorless laughter from the rest of the committee . It echoed off the wood paneling and around the sparsely populated Congressional hearing room . Phleger leaned down close to the gadget . The squeal of feedback was painful . " Uh , I could use some more water , Senator . " He straightened his tie and re-took his seat . Aiken waved at a clerk to take some water over to the State Department 's legal advisor . After all , Herman Phleger was the man who had headed the U.S. delegation at the Conference on Antarctica . He at least deserved a glass of water . Phleger leaned in close to the microphone again as he adjusted his chair and thanked the Senator . He could almost hear the old bastard 's cogs whirring from across the room . The Red scare . Grab some territory now while we still can . What with Khrushchev still fuming over that U-2 spyplane business back in May and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southeast Asia last Thursday . Yeah , okay , so China and Russia are n't exactly on speaking terms but that 's playing with fire . Of course Francis Gary Powers was working for the military : everyone in the State Department knew that . Although it was n't exactly a lie when the government had tried to say he was flying a " weather " plane . They simply wanted to know " whether " or not the Russians had any missiles in the area . The clerk set a pitcher of ice water down on the desk . The legal advisor ignored the hissing and popping of exploding ice cubes as he poured himself a glass and gulped down a mouthful . " Senator , " he said , sighing with relief and mopping at his brow , " the Treaty specifically provides that no one surrenders its claim . There are seven claims which cover eighty percent of Antarctica : the United Kingdom , France , Argentina , Chile , New Zealand , Australia , and South Africa . You take the sector Argentina and Chile have-they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they claim apply to them , and the same is true with respect to New Zealand . So they do have government in those territories . " So tough shit , Senator , we just were n't quick enough when it was time to stake a claim . Just be glad the Russkies do n't have a plot either . Phleger coughed again . " So , Senator , there may only be fifty people in the area but they do have governments . " Aiken was clearly uncomfortable with that thought . He shifted in his chair , like his ass spoke his mind for him . " But after the adoption of this Treaty , would the laws of a dozen countries apply ? " Phleger did n't need to check his notes . He shook his head . " The Treaty says that the signatories do not give up their claims , but the other signatories like the United States that do not recognize their claims do not by the Treaty recognize the claims and their position of non-recognition . " There , that ought to confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift on his ass again . Phleger pretended to be impatient . " For instance , " he added , " if there was a commercial man-the Treaty deals with scientists and it deals with military matters ... " It was clear Aiken wanted a re-cap on that area . Phleger took another breath . " Okay , " he said , " if we send a scientist or an inspector into the section claimed by Chile , he ca n't be arrested by Chile . Our jurisdiction applies to him no matter where he is in Antarctica-because we made the decision not to recognize other claims to the territory , and because those other claimants made the concession that they would allow our scientists and unarmed military personnel to work within their territory on Antarctica . But , if there should be a mining engineer who went down into the sector claimed by Chile and he got into some trouble , Chile would claim that its laws governed . " Aiken frowned . Phleger shifted this time . Was Aiken really that low on short-term memory ? " And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would claim that Chile 's law did not govern because we do not recognize Chile 's claim , and there would then be an international controversy as to who had jurisdiction over the individual . " It was double-Dutch . Phleger knew it was double-Dutch . Aiken did n't appear to know it was double-Dutch , but he did n't appear not to know either . Which was fine . So long as they were all in agreement . Since in essence , they were merely playing out what the Antarctic Treaty stated , which was : no matter what the claims of a single country over the region known as Antarctica , those claims could be freely ignored by everyone else . Except , and this was an important proviso , except in the case of a military build-up , which , it was agreed , was to be banned by everyone . Totally . Unless , of course , someone infringed upon the rights of the others as set out by the Treaty , in which case- " We do n't even recognize any claim of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . He rubbed his chin . This was their " legal " reasoning . " By recognizing that there is no sovereignty over Antarctica we retain jurisdiction over our citizens who go down there and we would deny the right of the other claimants to try that citizen . Yes . " Aiken sat back in his chair , a crooked grin on his craggy face . That pleased him enormously . He stubbed out his cigarette and immediately reached for another . " Boys , I think we just found one more virtue of the bomb ! " There was another ripple of laughter . He was right . Aside from the Soviet Union , who the hell was going to argue with them ? You did n't need to be the first . You needed to be the toughest . Aiken lit the fresh cigarette and inhaled . He had a curious look on his face . Somber . " Suppose , Mr. Phleger , " he pondered , " that there was a sudden and tremendous demand for emperor penguins ? " " Sir ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phleger . There are serious conservation issues here . What if people went down there and started killing all the emperor penguins . Who could prevent that ? " " The people in each of the geographical areas covered by the seven claimant nations would claim they had a right to protect those penguins . " " Then suppose one of our boys went into the Chilean area and stole a snow cat . What law would he violate ? " A snow cat ? ! What on earth was this old buzzard talking about ? Snow cats did n't come from Antarctica . Phleger bit the bullet . " The Chileans apply Chilean law , " he said . " And we would deny it ? " " We would apply U.S. law and we would have an international controversy . " " I see . " " Senator , it does n't matter , the reason for the crime . Yes , the environment down there is an issue in the Treaty , but the situations you describe just are n't covered . We would have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are dealing with an area where we have no territorial claims and this Treaty deals with matters in the international field exclusively . That 's why it 's important that Antarctica remain demilitarized . " Aiken 's face adopted another grimace . " That 's all well and good , Mr. Phleger , but supposing natural resources of great value were discovered in Antarctica , of value enough so that it would justify an immense cost to exploit them . It might be a vein of diamonds a foot thick . " Phleger let a sneer cross his face . He was no fan of Aiken , but he was a patriot . " There is no provision in this Treaty which would deal with that situation , Senator . If there was a discovery of value in a sector which was claimed by one of the claimant nations it would naturally claim sovereignty and the right to dictate the manner of exploitation . The United States on the other hand , never having recognized the validity of that claim , is in a position to assert that it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone break the Treaty on demilitarization to protect its claim , the United States may use whatever force is necessary in order to protect the Treaty . " Aiken smiled . " At least , that 's what we can say . " " Yes , Senator . We can . " * * * The Antarctic Treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate by 66 votes to 21 on August 10 , 1960 . And that was how the world left it until 1993 , when it was agreed that everyone should plow through this shoddy mess one more time . And again it was agreed that apart from the banning of the military and banning the exploitation of mineral wealth in respect to the environment , no country could lay claim to Antarctica . Which was a dangerous conclusion to reach for a number of reasons , one of which had yet even to be addressed . For it proved that the Antarctic Treaty 's vague double-talk had achieved exactly what it had set out to do : that should it stand as law in the face of overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anything of value were discovered in Antarctica , anarchy would reign supreme . The Antarctic Treaty guaranteed that even if mankind had any desire to rid itself of the Seven Deadly Sins , Greed had been assured of a place in our hearts by virtue of time . By writing it down on a piece of paper and parading it as law and belief , Greed could be resurrected at a moment 's notice . That was the beauty of the written word . It was invariably taken at face value and granted permit to be spoken as the truth . It lived longer than the man . And wreaked havoc in the process . ANTARCTICA The sacred symbols of the cosmic elements , the secrets of Osiris , had been hidden carefully . Hermes , before his return to the heavens , invoked a spell on them and said , " O holy books which have been made by my immortal hands , by incorruption 's magic spell , remain free from decay throughout eternity and incorrupt by time . Become unseeable , undefinable , from everyone whose foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven shall bring instruments for you , whom the Creator shall call his souls . " Thus spake he , and laying the spells on them by means of his works , he shut them safe away in their rooms . And long has been the time since they were hid away ... The Virgin of the World Taken from the Corpus Hermeticum circa A.D. 100 LAT. 6720 'S , LONG . 18016'W ROSS SEA-OFF THE ROSS ICE SHELF NEW ZEALAND ROSS DEPENDENCY Ralph Matheson felt nauseous . So much so , he 'd just lost his breakfast , which was now a glistening yellow tiger-stripe frozen solid down the side of Red Osprey 's iron-oxide-colored hull . He had the shakes bad . Always did when he felt sick . He quickly wiped his mouth on his coat sleeve before gripping the rail tightly and heaving again . Frozen chunks hit the swell below , but the sound was lost in the roar of the storm . " Hey , dickhead ! " a crusty voice commented . " There 's a ten-thousand-dollar pollution fine for puking in the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty and solidly built . His voice sounded like throat cancer was paying a visit , while he wore his gray hair in a buzz-cut like a marine 's . A sharp contrast to Matheson 's curly nut-brown mop which he kept firmly tucked inside his hood . Matheson was sure Bulger had his head bare just for machismo . Not that Matheson could care less . He just wanted to stay warm . That was why he 'd grown the beard to begin with . Bulger be damned . Matheson did n't want to be out here anyway , checking main derrick uplinks . He 'd avoided it all morning . Hid in the galley for a half hour , reading a printout of Reuters news reports off the web and nursing a coffee and doughnut . As far as he could tell , the sensors attached to the base of the huge , battered drilling tower were fine . The intermittent signal dropout was down to a faulty connection which he 'd fixed in seconds . There was no way that his equipment was going to jeopardize the drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had absolutely no control over . He eyed the mass of nine-foot sectioned steel drill pipe as it shot up and down , caged inside the derrick . Bad idea . He gripped the hand-rail again . Clenched his stomach . Bulger swiped his co-worker on the back . It seemed playful to outsiders , but Matheson knew better . Bulger was trying to make him spew his guts again . Matheson watched the smoke from Bulger 's cigar mix with his breath and drift his way . He shivered . Trying to keep his voice slow and even so he could hold his temper and the rest of his breakfast down all in one go , he said , " There are seven lows gathering-all within a fifty-mile radius . This is not typical Antarctic weather . I was told to expect four , maybe even five lows-ferocious weather conditions by anyone 's standards . But seven is unheard of ! I do not relish the idea of being part of weather formation history ! " Bulger puffed on his cigar . " Bracing , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use ! " Matheson shrieked . " Hell on earth , maybe . Or the final Canto in Dante 's Inferno , if you knew what the hell that was ! If you read anything other than Penthouse ! " The weather fronts were moving in fast and deadly . Coming out of nowhere . Matheson was acutely aware that out here there was a good chance it might get him killed . And listening in on the scientific chatter from McMurdo Station had n't helped matters . The scientists had absolutely no explanation for such severe weather . Antarctic weather . The only certainty was , it was going to be bad . At approximately 60 degrees of latitude south , the winds thundered in from every major ocean with nothing to stop them . Not one island . Not one mountain . A ship could set a course to follow precisely LAT. 58% in effect circumnavigate the globe , and never once run into dry land . The Antarctic was the most forbidding place on earth and Matheson was certain of one thing : he wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked Bulger shakily , wiping at his mouth again . Bulger did n't bother replying . Just braced himself as a small wall of water crashed across the bow and sprayed the crew . He watched with a satisfied air as it caught Matheson off-guard . Matheson wiped his face down . They were both engineers . Matheson was usually a desk man , designing setups on a workstation and never going anywhere near the field . Bulger was the exact opposite . A real hands-on kind of guy who spent most days elbow deep in grease , fixing problems with common sense , guile and a wrench . They both knew their stuff , of course . Pressures per square millimeter , per square inch . How to cause a stress fracture , and how not to . They both knew textbook stuff and more . But Bulger knew construction workers and roughnecks . He knew how their minds worked and how they liked to work . As far as he was concerned , Matheson knew shit . And Matheson knew this . Bulger climbed up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your node . " Matheson 's face fell . " What kind of problem ? " The drill ship lurched , bucking on another ferocious wave . They were getting bigger , Matheson thought . That one had to be at least 30 feet high . He felt his knees tremble as he watched the turquoise ocean race up to meet him then dip away again . A thunderous blast of freezing blue water and ice crashed over the bow and swept up deck in a tidal wave . In the time it took him to turn his head to see , the vast yellow derrick , the mighty drilling tower , had already borne the brunt of the impact and the 50-knot winds were whipping the water back into a frenzy . Before he even knew what hit him , Matheson was knocked on his ass and smacked backward . ( Continues ... )
