The challenge to the New Frontier was clear : If Republican Teddy Roosevelt could enforce physical fitness upon his staff , then why should n't Democrat Jack Kennedy do the same with McGeorge and Artie and even portly Pierre ? <P> Kennedy 's competitive instincts were aroused by an old T.R. order requiring that all Marine Corps company officers be able to march 50 miles in 20 hours , double-timing the last 700 yds . Marine Commandant David M. Shoup , a physical-fitness bug , had dug the order out of the corps files , sent it on to Kennedy as a curiosity . Replying to Shoup , History Buff Kennedy noted : " President Roosevelt laid down such requirements not only for the officers of the Marine Corps but , when possible , for members of his own family , members of his staff and Cabinet , and even for unlucky foreign diplomats . " <P> Kennedy suggested that Shoup see if the Marines of 1963 could match their counterparts of 1908 .

Semper paratus , one 49-year-old lieutenant colonel got off to a head start , cut 6 hours off the time limit . Kennedy indicated that if the Marines passed their test he would do something about measuring the fitness of his rather sedentary White House staff . His interest seemed to focus on Press Secretary Pierre Salinger , who is best known as an indoor sport . <P> Asked by newsmen for comment , Salinger at first found the threat difficult to believe , but then pride took over : " I do n't want the impression to get around that this is a completely ludicrous proposition . " After all , Salinger recalled , while in college he had twice competed in the cross-country run and each time managed to finish tenth in a field of eleven . <P> Just in case his boss should demand of him feats above and beyond the call of duty , Salinger went into training : he walked , rather than rode , the block-and-a-half from the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week the President also : <P> &gt; Sent to Congress a special message on mental health ( see MEDICINE ) . <P> &gt; Reappointed Democrat William McChesney Martin , 56 , to a fourth four-year term as chairman of the board of governors of the independent Federal Reserve System . Early in the Kennedy Administration , Martin 's efforts to restrict banking credit clashed with Administration views that the U.S. money supply should be expanded to stimulate economic growth . But last week the President warmly lauded Martin for having " cooperated effectively with the economic policies of this Administration .

The President recalled some Episcopal eloquence by " my fellow Bostonian , " the Rev. Phillips Brooks ( 1835-93 ) : " Do not pray for easy lives . Pray to be stronger men . Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers . Pray for powers equal to your tasks . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
