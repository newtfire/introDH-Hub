Unlike the cramped taxicabs that passengers around the world must frequently endure , the tall , black and boxy London taxi is well loved for its roominess and comfort . Conservative Londoners were thus greatly alarmed when a Birmingham company called Metro Cammell Weymann said it was building a streamlined rival to the traditional taxi , which is made by London Taxis International and first appeared in 1948 . <P> They need not have worried . Despite its more modern styling , the new cab , which was introduced last month and is known as the Metrocab , is at least equal in comfort to the older models . It has a sleeker hood but is still clearly a taxi . Its color , of course , is black . MCW plans to produce 1,000 Metrocabs in 1987 , or about half the number of traditional cabs that London Taxis International sells each year .
