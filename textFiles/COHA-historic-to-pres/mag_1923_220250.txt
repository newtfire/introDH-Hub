WARS <P> Five wars disturb the peace of the world : <P> Italy is engaged in suppressing rebel forces in Tripolitania ( Tripoli Italiana ) ; there is a state of civil war in South Ireland ; General Wu 's forces are fighting the Military Governor of Szechwan in Western China ; the French and Germans are snarling at each other in a war of attrition in the Ruhr ; trouble has again broken out over the Polish- Lithuanian boundary . <P> Italy 's colonial interests have been brought to the front by the recent fighting in Tripoli , which has cleared the ground held by the rebels since 1915 . In her last victory Italy gained important strategical positions which have given her control over the whole of her large colony , with a few unimportant exceptions . Italy came into possession of Tripoli during her war with Turkey , 1911-12 . It was annexed in 1911 , and in the Treaty of Ouchy , signed in October , 1912 , Italian sovereignty was formally established . <P> The war in China is being waged by General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capital of Szechwan , the most westerly province , in the hope of forcing the Governor of that province to recognize Wu as actual ruler of China . In the meantime the recently returned Dr. Sun Yat Sen has formed a triple alliance with Chang Tso Liu and General Tuan Chi Jui for the purpose of bringing General Wu into line with them , by force if necessary . <P> Lithuania has broken the truce recently agreed upon with the Poles by attacking their advance guards in the central area southeast of Vilna . The object of the truce was to settle the boundary dispute amicably , but the sudden agression by Lithuania points to the long arm of Moscow . <P> The original cause of this war was a disagreement over the boundary dividing Lithuania and Poland at the time both these countries received their liberty . Immediately war was prevented by the League of Nations , which marked off a neutral zone to keep the two nations on friendly terms and then took on the thankless task of settling their dispute . After much deliberation the Council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demarcation line and ordered Poland to occupy her portion of the neutral zone . A. desultory war has been in progress ever since . <P> The troubles of Ireland and the Ruhr are dealt with elsewhere .
