The major part of the bituminous coal industry today signed a " voluntary " agreement with the United Mine Workers of America for a wage increase of 20 cents an hour or $1.60 a day . It was the first time since World War I that a peace pact in the soft coal industry had been arranged without prolonged negotiations or a strike . The agreement to stabilize labor relations for at least fourteen months and possibly longer , was announced in the office of John L. Lewis , president of the United Mine Workers of America . Mr. Lewis and spokesmen for the coal industry joined in stressing the peaceful nature of the monthlong parleys in contrast to the bitterness and recriminations that occurred for ten months before the last contract was signed , March 6 , 1950 . All participants also called the agreement a constructive contribution to the present needs of the nation . Beside Mr. Lewis those who signed the agreement today were Harry M. Moses , president of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association ; Joseph E. Moody , president of the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Illinois Coal Operators Association . Mr. Treadwell also signed for operators in Wyoming , Kentucky , West Virginia and Virginia . The operators who signed today represented about 400,000,000 tons of an annual production of 500,000 , - 000 . Operators of Indiana and other areas are expected to sign the document soon . Today 's agreement affects more than 370,000 soft-coal miners . The remaining companies will sign for mines employing an additional 30 , - 000 . Negotiations are now under way covering 75,000 anthracite operators in Pennsylvania . A similar agreement is expected . The new contract amends the one signed in March . It means an average rise-of 10 per cent in daily basic wage rates . It will also result in an increase of about 6 per cent in the mine price of coal . Such an increase was defended by operators today as moderate . The $1.60 daily wage rise is effective Feb. 1 . Then the new daily basic wage scale will average $16.35 . It is now $14.75 . The rise in miners ' wekly earnings will be $8 . The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased to 581.75 for a five-day , forty-hour week , the highest earnings in the industry 's history . Mr. Lewis had attempted to cut the work day by a half hour and to increase the present 30 cents a ton paid into the miners welfare and retirement fund . In , this he was unsuccessful . The present eight-hour work day includes an average of one hour for " travel time , " that is , for the time it takes the miners to walk or ride from the bottom of the shaft to their work places and back . It also covers a half hour for lunch . Michael V. DiSalle , Director of Price Stabilization , made this com-ment : " Any general increase in coal prices will be referred to our coal experts for study in relation to our current voluntary standards . On the basis of this study we might sentatives of the industry , such as ask for a conference with reprea similar recent conference with other industries . " Mr. Lewis was asked whether imminence of a possible wage and price feeze had anything to.do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He replied that " the imminence of everything had to do with it , including the imminence of cold weather this winter . " Mr. Moses said Government lwage stabilizers had not been consulted . He made it clear that the union had asked for the " voluntary " wage increase . This admission was in reply to a question whether the operators had started the conferences . With the faint trace of a wry smile , he said : " The operators had a contract . They were happy with it . " Mr. Lewis called the contract " a bread-and-butter " agreement so far as the union was concerned . Mr. Moody said : ' Even though there is no question but that the operators must increase the price of coal to the consumers we feel that the consumer shoudi have no complaint of such an increase , which will be small compared with that of the other commodities which they buy . " Mr. Moody said the coal price increase would still leave prices at the mine below those of 1948 and 1949 . John B. Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised the coal industry and the union .
