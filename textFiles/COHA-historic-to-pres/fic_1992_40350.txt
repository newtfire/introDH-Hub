Synopsis : As we ended last issue , Red the daring , red-whiskered sailor had separated the attractive Miss Mulliford from her fiance Whitmore , and had taken her for a wild tour of the Palomar County Fair , breaking almost every rule of decorum , and being pursued by both police and MPs . With Miss Mulliford 's help , Red had just performed a " swabbo , " successfully evading the MPs and disappearing into the fair 's " nudist colony . " Miss Mulliford was having the best time of her life , she now admits to the lawyer Mr. Emery , to whom she is recounting the tale , and who she hopes will be able to prevent her fiance , Whitmore , from taking revenge on Red . <p> Question : Red in a nudist colony  --  dear , dear me ! <p> A. : That 's exactly how I felt . Though it was n't so much a colony as an open-air theater , with seats on the side of a little hill . At the right of the stage you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something around there was inflammable . <p> Q. : Probably something was . <p> A. : Really , Mr. Emery , it was n't as nudist as advertised . The five girls on the stage were all dressed in the places where they ought to be dressed . <p> Q. : How did the boys like it ? <p> A. : Well , every seat was taken . But you could n't call it interesting . The five girls just sat around and read Wild West magazines ; a talking machine somewhere played " On the Beach at Waikiki " ; and now and again somebody would say through the loudspeaker , " What is nudism ? It is n't Buddhism . It 's a new way of life . Remember to stay and watch Zuleika , queen of American nudists , greet King Zozo , undisputed monarch of nudism in Europe . " <p> Q. : Another foreign entanglement . <p> A. : The girl with long hair was Zuleika . Well , on the right , and behind the hydrant , was a stucco cliff with a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each one  --  dressing rooms . On the curtain of the doorway farthest from the audience was a poster of King Zozo . He had whiskers . <p> Q. : That must have made you think of Red . <p> A. : I 'd just begun to wonder where Red was when the announcer stopped talking about nudism and Buddhism , and said , " Attention , all police officers , all special officers , all others with authority to make arrests . Fair headquarters hereby notifies you that a reward of $50 will be paid immediately to anyone apprehending and bringing to those headquarters the following tall , red-bearded sailor . " Then he went on and gave Red 's description and told what he 'd done that afternoon  --  most of it we 'd done together . But I was n't prepared for what came next . <p> Q. : What was it , Miss Mulliford ? A civilian defiance to the admiral and his shore patrol ? <p> A. : It was about me , Mr. Emery . " Female companion "  --  those were the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red 's female companion . <p> Q. : I should call that cut-rate offer an insult . <p> A. : A minute before , I 'd been a happy , carefree girl . Now I was a criminal with a price on my head . <p> Q. : It 'll help , when you write your memoirs . <p> A. : While I was trying to make up my mind about the best thing to do , the announcer said : " That is all from fair headquarters . Here in the nudist colony , America now greets Europe . Queen Zuleika welcomes King Zozo . Behold King Zozo ! " Zuleika got up ; the other girls stood behind her and they all looked toward the stucco cliff . The talking machine played " The Stars and Stripes Forever . " When it reached that bumpty-bump-bump part , the announcer said again , " Behold King Zozo ! " <p> Q. : What was your impression of King Zozo ? <p> A. : That was just the point , Mr. Emery : You could n't behold him because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over again and once more the announcer said , " Behold King Zozo ! " Nobody came . <p> Q. : Do n't tell me this is a murder mystery . <p> A. : Everybody in the audience was getting nervous , and you could notice Zuleika and the other girls whispering to each other . Finally the announcer said for the fourth time , " Behold King Zozo ! " The little curtain with the poster was pushed aside and there he stood . <p> Q. : King Zozo at last . <p> A. : Not King Zozo , Mr. Emery . Red  --  in a pair of white trunks . <p> Q. : You 're working too fast for one of my years . Admitting his undoubted genius , how could Red become King of the European nudists in such short order ? <p> A. : This is what had happened : When Red dropped over the wall he found himself at what you might call the back door of the stucco cliff . He laid his clothes to dry in a patch of sun and crawled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Emery , there he was in King Zozo 's dressing room , and right off the king had started to yell for help . Of course Red had to quiet him . Then Red tied him up . <p> Q. : One of the risks and hazards of royalty . <p> A. : When the announcer began to call for King Zozo , Red felt he might just as well take a chance impersonating the king as wait in the dressing room till somebody found him out . So he did . The girls did n't give him away , Mr. Emery ; they just smiled at him . <p> Q. : That old magnetic personality , Miss Mulliford . <p> A. : Red took Zuleika 's hand , made a low bow , and was getting away with it , when a little sailor in the back row stood up and hollered , " Hey , Red , you know me . Ask her if she 's got a friend . " Then , Mr. Emery , everything seemed to happen at once . <p> Q. : The forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : And they started right after it . But , Mr. Emery , you ought to have seen the way Red got that fire hose into action . <p> Q. : Naval efficiency . <p> A. : Using it like a machine gun , he backed up slowly till he was almost at the stucco cliff . Just then , from the dressing-room door behind him , out popped the real King Zozo , and you should have seen that man 's face , Mr. Emery ! <p> Q. : Contorted with rage , as the boys say ? <p> A. : His eyes were mostly whites ; all his teeth showed ; and in his hands he had a sheet he was getting ready to throw over Red 's head . I screamed , " Red , look behind you . " Red did n't hear me . <p> Q. : Do n't spare me : I want to hear it all . <p> A. : There was a flash of white , the sheet was around Red , and the two of them had fallen backwards and rolled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began threshing around like a snake . <p> Q. : Something told me I should have gone to that fair . <p> A. : I 'd shut my eyes , because I could n't stand the excitement , when somebody yelled , " There he is ! Grab him ! " When I opened my eyes there was a pile like you see on a football field after a fumble . I could see one edge of the sheet and a pair of long bare legs sticking out underneath . <p> Q. : Poor Red ! I 'm sorry they got him . <p> A. : The crowd piled off . Then they began working at the sheet . It was tied around him with a hard knot . They had to cut the rope . <p> Q. : Was Red hurt ? <p> A. : But it was n't Red , Mr. Emery . <p> Q. : Was n't Red ? Who in tunket was it ? <p> A. : It was King Zozo . You see , Red had used his vaudeville stuff ; he 'd whipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then tied him up again and rolled him out of the dressing room . Before they found out the mistake Red was gone . <p> Q. : You 'll excuse me , Miss Mulliford , while I wipe the sweat from my brow and take a few long breaths . <p> A. : Back on Administration Boulevard I was just beginning to breathe again myself , when two shore-patrol boys stopped me . " Act nice , sister , " they said , " because we 've got the goods on you . You 're Red 's sweetie and a guy heard you say you 're meeting him tonight at seven o'clock on the corner of Shakespeare Lane and Court of Honor Promenade . We 'll be there with you , because we want to meet Red too . " I said , " If you do n't let me alone I 'll scream . " <p> Q. : Quite right . The Navy has no authority over civilians . <p> A. : They said , " Look , sister . We do n't want the cops to get Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more out of his pay . But if you wo n't play ball with us , we 'll let the cops get him and we 'll cash you in for the $25 . Now what ? " <p> Q. : A heartbreaking dilemma . <p> A. : There did n't seem any way out . I said I 'd string along with the Navy . <p> IV <p> Answer : They offered to let me eat dinner , but I could n't eat anything , Mr. Emery . So , a little before seven , they took me to the corner where I 'd arranged to meet Red . There was a wall back of the bench , and it seemed as though half of the Navy were hid and waiting behind that wall . <p> Q. : An agonizing situation . <p> A. : And everything on all sides was so gay . The Official Fair Band was playing a program of old favorite songs ; actors from the Shakespeare Theater and Spaniards from the Spanish Village came by in costume . Everybody happy . And I sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. : Just like the heroine of a novel . <p> A. : And every now and then it seemed as though it would stop beating when I 'd see a couple of special officers or a shore patrol come along with a red-whiskered sailor . <p> Q. : With Red ? <p> A. : Oh , no , Mr. Emery , it was never Red , though I counted seven that had the same kind of whiskers . I suppose their throats were delicate ; though judging by the way they objected it did n't sound as if their throats could be very delicate . <p> Q. : Sweet mystery of life in the Navy . <p> A. : Each time one of the shore-patrol boys from behind the wall would take a peek and then whisper , " Naw , that ai n't him . " Then he 'd get down again . Well , Mr. Emery , I 'd made up my mind to one thing . <p> Q. : What was that ? <p> A. : Just as soon as I saw Red I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . <p> Q. : Good for you . <p> A. : I was sitting there , Mr. Emery , when all at once I heard a sound coming nearer and nearer  --  like this . <p> Q. : You mean like this . <p> A. : That 's it , Mr. Emery . <p> Q. : Coconut shells would be better , but I 'll make these two paperweights do . How 's that ? " <p> A. : Gallop ! Gallop ! Gallop ! <p> Q. : Gallop-gallop-gallop ! <p> A. : Round the corner from the Court of Honor Promenade came a big white horse . Riding the horse was- <p> Q. : Do n't tell me  --  I want to guess . The rider was n't Richard the Lionhearted because it was- <p> Q. and A. : Red ! <p> A. : He was all dressed up in Richard the Lionhearted 's armor  --  I suppose he 'd walked in and " borrowed " it , including the horse . You could n't see it was Red because the helmet covered his face ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood up . It seemed as though it was something that had happened to me before . <p> Q. : Woman through the ages , waiting to be carried off by the right young man . <p> A. : I stood up ; the horse was very close now . <p> Q. : Gallop-gallop-gallop ! <p> A. : Red did n't even hesitate . He leaned over , reached down , and grabbed me up . The next minute we were off and away with the Navy yelling after us . But I just kept my eyes closed and snuggled up close to Red . <p> Q. : Kidnapped by Richard the Lionhearted ! <p> A. : There was never anything like it . And when Red was n't yelling to people to get out of the way , he said things to me . Wonderful things . Tender . <p> Q. : Never judge a man by his whiskers . <p> A. : Somehow we got through the gates and across a couple of fields and down an arroyo . Then we stopped under the cliff by the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Q. : I know I wo n't be able to sleep tonight . <p> A. : We jumped off the horse and Red chased it down the beach ; then he pitched his armor into the water , kissed me , and said , " I 'm going to swim out to the old wagon and save a lot of trouble . Good-by , Peaches , and get out of here quick , because they 're coming . " He kissed me again and dove into the surf . <p> Q. : Happy ending . <p> A. : I climbed the stairs to the top of the cliff , just before a lot of police came hooting up on motorcycles . They followed the horse . At that moment Red turned to tread water and wave both arms at me . It was as though he 'd given the signal . <p> Q. : The signal ? What signal ? <p> A. : The signal to the Official Fair Band , Mr. Emery . Because at that very moment the band started playing another old favorite  --  " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so perfect , Mr. Emery . I sat down and cried for two hours . <p> Question : So Red got away . Remarkable young man . <p> A. : And ever since I met Red , Whitmore 's been studying Spanish . <p> Q. : Because he ca n't express his feelings adequately in English ? <p> A. : No , Mr. Emery ; he 's studying because , if a certain thing happens , he 's going over into Mexico . <p> Q. : Let 's hope it happens ; then you can wave Whitmore good-by . <p> A. : But , Mr. Emery , once Whitmore 's over the border he 's going to gather together a few trusty natives and start in as a bandit . And first of all there 's the tragedy to consider . <p> Q. : Oh , there wo n't be much tragedy : The Mexican Government has had lots of experience . Besides , what 's the difference ? <p> A. : You do n't understand what I 'm trying to say . Whitmore 's bought a big blue pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. : But , Mr. Emery , he 's going to shoot at somebody . <p> Q. : I 'll bet he misses . <p> A. : Mr. Emery , you 've forgotten Red . <p> Q. : Forgotten Red ! No , Miss Mulliford , never . Forget Red ! Not so long as a single drop of blood courses through these aging arteries . You do n't mean , do you , that before turning bandit , Whitmore is going to blast Red ? <p> A. : That 's what he keeps telling me . <p> Q. : Going to swim out to the fleet with the big blue pistol in his pocket ? <p> A. : It 's not a joke to me , Mr. Emery . Besides , Whitmore says he 's going to shoot the pistol when Red comes to see me in Pasadena . <p> Q. : Whitmore will be chagrined when Red catches the bullet between his teeth . <p> A. : You should n't talk that way , Mr. Emery . The tragedy might be taking place at this very minute . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. : Yes , he is . <p> Q. : On a white horse ? <p> A. : He says he 's coming in the admiral 's car . <p> Q. : Then Red and the admiral are on speaking terms again ? <p> A. : Not exactly , Mr. Emery . You see , Red told me he 's going to borrow the car without mentioning it to the admiral . But of course that 's impossible because it 's an expensive car and the admiral has it very carefully guarded . <p> Q. : Just the same I 'm betting on Red . <p> A. : It 's fantastic , Mr. Emery . But my whole life seems to have become just as fantastic . Here I 've been engaged to Whitmore for two years and now Red says he 's going to marry me . Did you ever hear of anything so silly ! <p> Q. : That suggests to me that Red has lots of good common sense . <p> A. : But , Mr. Emery , we have n't any business trifling like this , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no danger . I 've heard a lot of different Whitmores talk ; but they never shoot anybody  --  not even themselves . Suppose I call the chief of police , and we 'll have Whitmore warned in a highly official and impressive manner to keep his popgun in the bureau drawer . <p> A. : But  --  will he keep it there ? <p> Q. : Take my word for it , Miss Mulliford , he will . <p> A. : But afterwards , Mr. Emery , afterwards ; if in despair he becomes a Mexican bandit-then I 'll be responsible . <p> Q. : He wo n't go to Mexico . Anybody like Whitmore would much prefer to hang around Pasadena hoping your marriage with Red will bust up so he can say , " I told you so . " <p> A. : But , Mr. Emery , I have n't the slightest intention of marrying Red . Why , I hardly know him . <p> Q. : Marry him and get acquainted . <p> A. : Ridiculous ! <p> Q. : How about regarding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain at top efficiency , if our admirals are to be saved from apoplexy , somebody 's got to marry Red . And you 're the logical choice . <p> A. : I never heard such nonsense . Red 's merely a passing acquaintance ; I 'm not even sure that I like him ; and he 's  --  Oh-oh , Mr. Emery , look down there . He 's waiting for me ! It 's Red ! It 's Red ! It 's Red ! <p> Q. : And in the admiral 's car . <p> A. : How perfectly insane ! I told him not to do it . <p> Q. : He 's done it , all right . Well , if you have any trouble , telephone me , and I 'll try to fix things . Remember that even though your future life with Red may resemble a trip around the world on a roller coaster  --  you 'll never be bored . Incidentally , I think that young man , given the right feminine influence , is going places . <p> A. : Mr. Emery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him ? <p> Q. : If he does n't kidnap you and take you to the city-hall marriage bureau , it will be because his eyesight is failing . You 're prepared to sweep him off his feet . <p> A. : Why , I had n't even dreamed of such a thing . <p> Q. : Then why are you all dressed up like the Queen of Sheba ? <p> A. : This is just an old rag , Mr. Emery . The idea ! <p> Q. : Perhaps it 's the girl in the dress . Mark my words , Red wo n't be able to resist . If I were in his shoes , I know I could n't . It 's a good thing I have n't a big blue  --  Dear me , Miss Mulliford , that was a very sweet and charming gesture and at my age one appreciates it . Red 's an extremely fortunate young man .... No , not a cent . I was going to charge you $10,000 , but I feel overpaid already .... Well , if you insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding cake . Good-by and the best of luck .... Oh , Miss Johnson . Never mind those letters ; come over to the window  --  I want to show you one of my clients . See that girl getting into the big car ? It 's an admiral 's car ; but the young man with the red whiskers is n't an admiral . Still , notice his technique . Does n't that suggest the Higher Command ? And there they go  --  youth in the Admiral 's car . It 's a symbol . Miss Johnson , do you believe in reincarnation ? You know , if I 'm ever born into another existence I ca n't remain a civilian  --  at least not any longer than it takes to grow red whiskers and join the Navy . <p>
