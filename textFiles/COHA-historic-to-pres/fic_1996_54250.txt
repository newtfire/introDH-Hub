No Joejoey-oe makes six . Six dead since summer . " <p> " Maybe they 'll take us at the Gibson Street shelter . " " Deader than dead , Joey . Broke his promise too . " " I need a drink a hell of a lot more than a bed . " " Me , I need food . Stomach is tight as a fist . " " Someone stoke the fire . It 's fuckin ' cold . " " This ai n't cold , Joe . Christmas is cold . " " You want to check out the Colonel ? " " Dumpster biscuits . Side of slaw . " " Valentine 's Day , Joey-oey . " " What about it ? " " That 's cold . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> I stand next to them , listening silently . As long as I do n't say anything , they ca n't see me . If I speak , there I am . But their conversation gutters like the fire and goes out and the quiet gets all creepycrawly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embankment to the river to take a leak . The bridge sings to me as a truck passes over , stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni . My piss slaps heavily into the freezing water . I wave my dick at the EPA , zip , and turn left toward a sky full of mean stars . They get brighter in winter , bigger . Cold makes the air like a lens . At ten below stars can burn through a man 's eyes right into his brain  --  happened to me once . Downstream , there 's a giant 's comb washed up on the embankment . I slink over to it , trying to convince myself that it 's only a ladder with the side rail missing , that his footprints are just big smears of mud . If I do n't believe in him , see , he does n't exist . The wood is mostly dry so I decide to be a citizen and drag it up to the fire . <p> " You broke your promise , Joey-oey-oey-oe . " He swallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yodel . " No Joey-noey-oey-oey-oe . " He has the voice for it , but no rhythm . Crazy as a chicken and chatting with his hallucinations . It 's a luxury I ca n't afford because of the curse . My hallucinations can come true if I 'm not careful . I break some teeth off the comb and toss them into the fire barrel . <p> " No **28;822;TOOLONG . " <p> " Hey Gene Autry , shut the fuck up . " <p> As flames lick out of the barrel , I eyeball them . Gene Autry is wrapped in a tarp beneath one of those easy-load shopping carts where the basket rides high and shallow . Two guys are lying together in a cardboard box with a picture of a computer desk on it . They 've stuffed it with newspapers for warmth . Tape the ends , stick a $200 stamp on the box and we could mail them to Florida . Or North Dakota . A black guy is stretched out in the shadows that flutter like crows against the bridge abutment . Asleep or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrunk like dead men do . <p> " Gene Autry ? " says one of the box guys . " Is that what you called him ? How old are you anyway ? " <p> " Old enough to be fuckin ' president . " <p> " Joey-noey-oey-oey-no . " <p> " Listen , I got ta eat . " <p> " So eat . " The box shudders . " Besides , you ai n't got shit to drink . " " No . " <p> If that 's true , I ca n't stay with them . If I do n't pour some alcohol on my imagination soon , the river could thicken to blood . Frogs might crawl up my pants . <p> " But Mags 'll have a bottle . Always does . " <p> " Always does , " says Gene Autry , " even though Joey 's dead and some other Joe is next . Like this one , no ? " He points at me , even though I still have n't said anything . Maybe he thinks I 'm one of his hallucinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's staring X rays through me . <p> " This Mags , " I say , speaking for the first time . " He says , " Mags ai n't a fuckin ' bus . " <p> " She tries to help . " <p> " Sorta like the fairy godmother , Nojo , " says Gene Autry . <p> " More like Santa . " <p> " Ai n't many left like old Mags . " <p> I stir the bones of the fire , feel its smoky breath on my face . <p> " Where you from , Nojo ? " says Gene Autry . <p> " That 's not my name . " I left my name under the plastic chair in that hospital waiting room a longtime ago . I can be anyone now , see . Bob Hope , Madame Curie , Baby Jesus , Lassie , anything I can imagine . That 's the curse . But I should never have opened my mouth . They 're asking me questions , next they 'll be taking my pulse . <p> " You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I keep my voice locked up . Its wings tickle my throat . <p> " Someplace secret maybe ? " <p> " Like Fort Knox ? " <p> " The North Pole ? " <p> " No-no-no Joe . Oz . " <p> A car passes over and the bridge sings to me again , sun so hot I froze to death . But death hits an odd , clangy note , like a cell door slamming . Like a warning . I glance up at the bridge . When I look back , there they are , standing on the other side of the fire . <p> The man is wearing a long , open military coat over eighteen sweaters . A ski mask covers his face . He is carrying a nylon bag with NASA printed on it . He tucks it under his arm and it clinks . She 's taller , with wide , square shoulders . She has on that tatty mink coat my mother gave to the Salvation Army in 1969 . It makes her look like a fur refrigerator . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's wearing lipstick . " Evening , boys . " We can see her breath when she speaks . " Nice weather for penguins . " She nods at me . " New member of the tribe. ? " <p> " Nojo , " says Gene Autry . " Nojo of Oz . " <p> She smiles at me . " You know , they 'll give you a free coat over on Gibson Street . " The lipstick has reddened her teeth . <p> " New here , " I say . " Not sure where all the buttons are yet . " <p> " He thought you were a man , Mags . " <p> " Coat might save your life , " she says . <p> " I 've got the fire , " I say . " I 'm okay . " <p> " Nojo 's okay , joey 's dead . Broke his promise . " <p> " Mags , I 'm glad to see you and everything , but I got ta ask . You got anything to drink ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ froze , one got run over . Dead , dead , dead , dead , dead , all dead . " <p> " Sell my left nut for a taste . " <p> " You thirsty ? " She watches me . My face disappears and I feel her read the nerves scribbling in my head . " Takes the chill off . " <p> I nod . <p> " Angel , some spirits for our new friend . " <p> Angel is nobody 's friend . He glares angrily , then squats to zip the NASA bag . The two box guys unpack themselves . Gene Autry walks his shopping cart forward without getting out from underneath the basket . The black guy sits , tries to stand and falls over on his side . He is thin as a knife . Angel hefts an unopened fifth of Conquistador whiskey into the firelight . He twists the cap ; the seal cracks with a sound like a cockroach popping . He drinks with his eyes fixed on me : two , three big swallows . He lowers the bottle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de tu puta madre ! " <p> The black guy coughs like an old Chevy and makes it up on the third try . <p> " What 'd he say ? " <p> " He shits in the milk of my whore mother . " Mags extends her hand for the bottle . <p> " ! Cono ! " <p> She wiggles her fingers . When he gives it to her , she passes it immediately to the black guy . His Adam 's apple bobs spasmodically , as if he 's trying to remember how to swallow . His hands shake as he tips his head back and kisses the bottle on the mouth . All it takes is one swallow and he 's steady as a gravestone . We watch as the whiskey makes its way slowly around the fire . When it 's my turn , I cradle the bottle for a moment . It is a Preferred Blend and has A Tradition of Excellence Since 1931 . The Conquistador is on horseback ; he 's wearing armor the color of an old spoon . He has ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes , in his quest for strong drink . I lift his bottled gold . <p> The whiskey vaporizes in my mouth and whistles down my throat like steam . It changes as it settles in my gut , becomes a kind of glow , only it carries a weight and the bitter fragrance of newly split oak . The fragrance curls into my blood , streams to my head . Then my vision blurs and for one short , infinitely sweet moment , things stop being like other things . They simply are . The bridge becomes the bridge , my shoe is itself only . I can no longer hear the world whisper of secret and insidious connections . Leaves cease to conspire with branches . The ground does not rise up to meet me . I am that dull and happy stranger who has nothing special about him . <p> " Hey , Nojo . " <p> " Next ! " <p> " Wake up , damn it . " <p> I feel someone grab at my sleeve and drag me back to the crackle and snap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topple new imaginations . <p> The bottle circles the fire three times before Mags stops it . By then the black guy is sitting , muttering , with his head between his legs . One of the box guys is shivering so hard it makes my bones rattle . I can still feel the cold creep through my shirt and pinch my nipples . But now I wear the armor of a conquistador and do n't care . I am stronger than weather ; if I want I can melt a hole to the center of the earth . Mags holds the bottle by its neck and waves it over the fire . Half an inch of whiskey splashes and skins down the sides . <p> " Once m-more , Mags . " The box guy 's teeth click like hail on a dumpster . <p> " Do n't be so damn greedy . " She shakes the bottle at him . <p> " I 'm f-f-fuckin ' freezing . Jesus , do I have to b-beg ? " <p> " You could , " she says . " Joe did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , Joe-oey would n't beg . " Gene Autry shakes his head . " Not Joey-oe . " <p> " Things change at the end , " she says . " I know , I was there . " <p> " Oh no . No-no-no . " Gene Autry lurches from under his shopping cart , sneezes and begins sorting through the treasures in the basket . " Oh no , you were n't . " <p> " Heard he died of fever . " <p> " Uh-uh . He fuckin ' froze . " <p> " He promised me , " says Gene Autry . A ball of twine flips out of the basket and ravels down the embankment toward the river . " Nope . No ! " <p> " I found him on a bench by the pond in Fisher Park , " she says . " He 'd pissed and puked himself . When I woke him up , he asked for help . I took him home . " <p> " Se la tiro . " <p> " He never touched me , barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him a hot bath . I put him in my own bed . I sang to him . " <p> " No way , no such bathtub . " Gene Autry points a shoe at Mags . " And where 'd you get a bed anyway ? " <p> " Where I got this whiskey , eh Angel ? " <p> Angel scratches his nose through the ski mask . " Eso es como cagadas de hormiga . " <p> " This is not ant shit . " She waggles the bottle at him . " It 's important . Six people are dead because they had no place to go . These men are suffering . " <p> He shrugs and picks up the NASA bag . <p> " Poor Angel does n't understand what we 're doing here . He 'd rather be home on the couch scratching his balls and watching It 's A Wonderful Life . Me , I try to help . " <p> " No , " says Gene Autry . " Nope . They found Joey behind the middle school . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I had to stick him someplace after it was over . He did n't care . " <p> " But he  --  okay . " Gene Autry finally finds what he 's looking for . " Okay , the no-good bastard was my only friend . " He shakes a white telephone handset loose from the pile and speaks into it . " You promised me , Joey-oe . No , you did . You said you 'd found it and you said you 'd show me the way back and you promised , Jojoey . " <p> " Back where ? " says Mags . <p> He waves for her to be quiet ; he 's listening . " No , Joe . " He listens some more . " No , but Joe . . . " He cups a hand over the speaker . " Back to the world . He promised to show me how . " <p> The box guys glance at each other in alarm , One takes the other by the hand and they scuttle back to their box . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long , I 'm invisible again . <p> " Give me that . " Mags transfers the whiskey bottle to her left hand and reaches for the handset with her right . <p> " Just a minute , Joey-oe . She wants to speak to you . " <p> She holds it a couple of inches away from her ear . " What ? " She shakes her head . " You 're dead , Joe . Hang up . " She tosses it back to Gene Autry . <p> His eyes are like wounds . " Joe ! " He listens , jiggles the handset , tries again . " Joe . " His voice is as small as a teardrop . It is suddenly so quiet that we can hear the black guy grumbling in his sleep . Even the fire is holding its breath . For a moment Gene Autry stares at the holes in the mouthpiece ; as if trying somehow to connect the pattern of dots into the dead man 's face . His mouth opens , closes . <p> " Shi . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keels onto his side . " Nmmm . " His face is the color of my father 's belt . <p> " You want to go back to the world ? There 's only one way . Climb up to the highway and head south into town . " Mags grasps Gene Autry 's shoulders and aims him upriver . " When you come to Summer , take a left . Go through three lights and bear left again onto Gibson . The shelter is number twenty-four . " <p> " Nomm , " the black guy mutters . " No room . " <p> He 's right . I 've never been able to fit my damned imagination inside any of the shelters or clinics or hospitals . Even now , diminished by the Conquistador , it 's still too swollen to be contained by any building . <p> Gene Autry shakes out of Mags 's grip , stumbles to the barrel and drops the phone into the fire . <p> " He begged for what ? " The question sneaks out of the side of my mouth . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Gene Autry drags his shopping cart away from us . <p> " You said he begged . " It 's the Conquistador , see , hijacking my voice . " What for ? " <p> " Whiskey , " she says . " Booze , the demon , the eighty proof miracle . " She grins . " Actually , I believe he called it laughing soup . " <p> " Joey would 've said that . " Gene Autry folds himself back under his basket . " Said it all the time , yeah , gim me a cup of the laughing soup . What Joe said . Only he 's dead . " <p> " That what you need , Nojo ? " Mags jiggles the bottle ; the whiskey sparkles . " Make a new man of you . " <p> " Sure , " says the Conquistador . He 's frightening me ; I 've never been two people at the same time before . <p> " Do n't bother , " says Gene Autry . " Nothing lasts . " <p> " I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Busy twisting the world into a poem . Hard to be so different . " I can feel Mags rummaging around inside our head . <p> " Fuck , yes , " says the Conquistador . <p> " Nmmm . Uhh , go home . " <p> " But get a load on and boom  --  you 're just like everyone else . " <p> " Boom . " The Conquistador laughs . <p> " Nojo disappears , " says Mags . <p> The Conquistador laughs again and waves our hand . " Bye . " <p> " No-no-no . " Gene Autry gathers the tarp tightly around him . " Do n't you understand ? Joe 's dead . Nothing lasts . " <p> " Oh , this can , " she says . " It 's a preferred blend , a special laughing soup just guaranteed to make you the same as everyone . Or maybe you 'd rather freeze with these crazies , die like poor Joe. ? I can help , but only if you let me . " She holds out the bottle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kiss . Just like in the fairy tale . " <p> She is going to put out my imagination . I can run away , except that I have the courage of a conquistador . <p> " The same as everyone . " <p> As she comes nearer , the whiskey starts to boil . <p> " Bye , Nojo . " <p> The bottle warps and sags around her hand , like plastic in a fire . <p> " Kiss . " <p> She catches me by the wrist . The dead mink smells like the back of my mother 's closet . I can still escape if I want but I am brave and hold my ground . The same . She lifts the ruined bottle , tilts the rest of the whiskey into her mouth and holds it there . As everyone . Her face grows huge and scary as the moon but I do n't flinch . A job , TV , and a bed with green sheets . When she kisses me , my lips part . <p> The whiskey floods from her into me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been frozen for years . I start to laugh and choke at the same time . There I was , sitting on the shoes in the back of my parents ' closet and I was wearing my dad 's motorcycle helmet and I had tied a towel cape around my neck and mommy was calling , " Petey , where are you ? Peter ! " and I tried not to giggle but I was only a little kid and she heard me and opened the door and she said , " Percy , I 've been looking all over , how long have you been sitting in the dark ? " and I said , " This is outer space and I 'm an astronaut and it has to be dark because it 's always nighttime in space . . . , " but before I could finish she caught me up in her arms and hugged me and said , " What am I going to do with you ? " and when I wriggled , my space helmet fell over my eyes and she laughed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You let your imagination run away with you , " and she kept laughing at me , so I told her I was not bad and mommy said , " No , it 's what makes you special , a kind of magic . Because if you have an imagination , you can do anything , be anything when you grow up . " Anything . <p> But it was n't her fault . See , she did n't realize it was a curse . <p> I woke the next morning . The fire was out . The box was empty . I was alone . Up under the shelter of the abutment was a bundle of old clothes . There was broken glass everywhere . I had a headache . The dim sunlight made it worse . <p> I climbed through the weeds to the top of the bridge . There were lots of cars now . People were going to work . I stuck my thumb out to hitch a ride . A car went by , heading south into town . It did n't stop . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the way that I looked .
