The scorecard on the still young 1988 election cycle would have been inconceivable a generation ago : two presidential candidates already dispatched by fatal headlines , several others wounded , a few discouraged from entering . As recently as the 1960s , journalistic convention protected the private lives of politicians except under unusual circumstances . Now any behavior that would earn demerits for a boy scout seems fair game . But is that fair ? Last week this trend was prompting some healthy reappraisal that might save campaign ' 88 from runaway triviality . As James Gannon , editor of the Des Moines Register , puts it : " A lot of respected journalistic guts are saying ' Whoa ! ' " <P> Not to the press 's proper occupation of examining candidates but to an increasing preoccupation with finding minute character flaws . The event that was giving pause to Gannon and others was the recent addition of marijuana use  --  no matter when it occurred  --  as a scandale du jour . The tendency to press excess was visible in a little-noted but unforgettable moment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moines for the Iowa Democrats ' Jefferson- Jackson Day dinner , ready to discuss the issues . That same day Douglas Ginsburg 's nomination to the Supreme Court went up in marijuana smoke , and the politicians were forced to hack through thickets of have-you-ever interrogation . Two ( Al Gore and Bruce Babbitt ) volunteered that they had . When it was Richard Gephardt 's turn at the pressroom ritual , he restated his lifelong purity concerning controlled substances . Then a question shouted from the back row : Why did n't you smoke marijuana ? If he could not be nailed as a pothead , then he would be tagged a nerd . <P> It has been a season of unprecedented questioning , which began when Gary Hart was asked in a press conference , " Have you ever committed adultery ? " Soon reporters were talking about who else would be asked the A question . And then the M question . Few candidates summoned the nerve to rebel , as Alexander Haig did on a CNN interview when asked why he was " touchy " about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , " he replied with a Haigian glare . " But if you ask me if I ( ( used marijuana ) ) , I 'm going to tell you it 's none of your damn business . " <P> That is exactly the response proposed by the Miami Herald 's Tom Fiedler , who was the lead reporter in the stakeout that broke the Gary Hart-Donna Rice story . Last week Fiedler wrote in a column that the " character issue " was now being carried to " absurd " lengths . David Broder of the Washington Post , the paper that delivered the final blow to Hart , also fretted . " It 's time to slow down and take another look at what we 're doing , " Broder wrote , " before more damage is done . " <P> New evidence that readers agree came last week , when the Times Mirror company published the latest installment of its " People , Press &; Politics " survey . Two-thirds of the 1,501 Americans polled by the Gallup Organization said journalists had gone " too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproved of the revelation about the date of Pat Robertson 's wedding , which occurred after his first child was conceived . But significant pluralities felt that the press had " acted properly " in reporting Joe Biden 's plagiarism as well as the role of Michael Dukakis ' campaign staff in Biden 's downfall .
