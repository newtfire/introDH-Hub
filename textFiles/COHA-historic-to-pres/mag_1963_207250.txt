" Matson Lines ' ' used to mean white cruisers ribboning through Hawaiian islands with luau , leis and instant romance for all aboard . As a business . Matson ( 1962 revenues : $100 million ) is somewhat less glamorous . Labor troubles and stockholder squabbles led it into a storm that climaxed in an operating loss of $2,400,000 in 1961 . Then , Matson called in a new skipper , Stanley Powell Jr. , 46 , rounding out his first year as president , proved last week that he has begun to bring the line back into clearer sailing weather : he reported that Matson earned $2,249,000 in 1962 , and had the best showing in six years on its all-important run to Honolulu . <P> <P> Serving the Owners . The line that was launched in 1882 by far-seeing Captain William Matson grew rich and lazy over the years as it came to dominate traffic between California and Hawaii . Long after Captain Matson 's death in 1917 his successors began to battle . A California-based faction , including the captain 's heirs , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oil and insurance companies to keep the conservative old line growing with the times . But a controlling faction led by three of Hawaii 's " Big Five ' ' companies* prevailed . They sold off Matson 's non-shipping properties , including its famous hotels on the beach at Waikiki , and insisted that Matson stick to Hawaiian shipping , on which much of their fortunes depended . Hawaii buys 65% of all its goods from the mainland . <P> But concentration on Hawaiian shipping made Matson a helpless victim of six Pacific ocean-going unions . Even though its Hawaii run was not subsidized by the U.S. Government , Matson had to follow suit when subsidized U.S. shipping lines gave in to frequent wage demands to avoid strikes . Result : labor now accounts for half of its operating costs on freighters and even more on passenger liners . High operating costs have also led to freight-rate rises of 48% since 1957 , prompting many Hawaiian businessmen to blame Matson for the island 's dizzily high prices and to shop for alternate shipping lines . Containing the Cargo . Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its fleet . Matson has converted one freighter into a floating garage to haul cars to Hawaii , and two others into bulk sugar carriers that pump their cargoes directly into the California refineries . But most of Matson 's $27 million investment since 1957 has gone toward outfitting its ships with trailerlike aluminum containers that make handling easier . Because of the savings , Matson has cut rates for containerized freight to 20% below its regular freight rates . <P> Matson still has its troubles . Despite hoopla promotion , its two Honolulu-bound passenger liners lost $2,200,000 last year . Now the Lurline is down with a nervous turbine . Matson would like to retire her , or to shift her or her sister , the Matsonia , away from Hawaii to the subsidized South Seas run . At a price of $1,500,000 in wage increases this year , Matson has bought labor peace at least through mid-1964 . President Powell is wary of pushing the unions too hard with automation plans , and he does not believe in bragging too much about the future . Says he : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shape where we have any future at all . " <P>
