Brokers unsell themselves <P> The demands that honesty places on stockbrokers can be excruciating . Over the past decade or so , 15 securities firms have made their own shares available for public purchase . They are forbidden by the New York Stock Exchange to solicit orders for their own stocks , and professional courtesy long kept them from commenting on the shares of competitors But now some brokers are taking a hard look at their business-and warning clients to stay away . <P> Paine Webber , the fourth largest publicly traded brokerage firm in terms of revenue in 1976 , has just issued a review of the 15 securities-firm shares . It rehearses the many troubles of the trade-increasing Government regulation , a cautious attitude on the part of big investors . Further , it finds that brokers have uncomfortably high ratios of debt to capital and argues that the firms ' earnings are on " a fragile foundation " because brokers , like their customers , never know what the market is going to do and have no way of forecasting the level of future business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting , the study concludes that not one of the 15 stocks can be recommended now . <P> Paine Webber did select three stocks-the " best of a bad bunch " - as possible buys " in a more favorable market environment than now exists . " A.G. Edwards &; Sons , Inc. for its " unique position " at the retail end of the industry ; Merrill Lynch for its leadership of the industry and First Boston , Inc. for its strong position on the institutional side . Merrill Lynch is preparing its own report on the industry , and it is likely to be gloomy . The TV ads will continue to proclaim that " Merrill Lynch is bullish on America , " but the firm is less than bullish on its own industry and , by implication , itself .
