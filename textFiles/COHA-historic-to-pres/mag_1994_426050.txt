Section : training 13 common exercise mistakes and how to avoid them <p> Back when you played sports in high school or college , you did n't have the option of slacking off in practice . That 's because you had a coach with eagle eyes and drill-sergeant vocal cords , threatening you with extra wind sprints the first time he saw you dog it around the track . <p> But now that you 're training on your own , it 's easy to pick up bad habits , fall prey to poor advice and  --  there 's no kind way to say this , fellas  --  just get lazy . One look down at an expanding middle is enough to make a guy nostalgic for the bark of old Coach Crackwhip . <p> Now , since there 's no one around to blow the whistle on you whenever you cheat on your workout , it 's up to you to make sure you 're not taking the easy way out  --  and robbing yourself of the health and fitness benefits you 're there to achieve in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few gentle boots in the pants , if you will  --  to knock you back on track . " A simple correction in your training or technique could make all the difference in the world , " says Randy Huntington , a Fresno , California , coach and fitness consultant whose client list has included Wayne Gretzky and world-record long jumper Mike Powell . <p> With the help of Huntington and other coaches , trainers and exercise physiologists , we 've identified eight of the most common training mistakes men make . Our quick fixes will help you get more from your workouts , spare you needless injury and boost your performance in your chosen sport . Mistake : Swimming with a kickboard <p> Using a kickboard would seem to be a good way to train your legs , since the foam board holds your body above water while your legs do all the work . In fact , a kickboard causes the hips and legs to drop lower , so they drag underwater , says Michael Collins , coach of the Davis , California , Aquatic Masters and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good swimmers keep their bodies horizontal on the surface , which makes them more streamlined , " he says . <p> Quick Fix : For a better workout , leave the kickboard on the pool deck , Collins suggests , and flutter-kick on your side . For proper freestyle form , extend your underwater arm in front of you and rest your surface arm against your side ; every 10 to 12 kicks , take a stroke to switch sides . This drill keeps your legs in alignment with your torso , the perfect position for slicing through the water . Mistake : Lifting with cold muscles <p> " Ninety percent of men who work out with weights do not warm up before lifting , " says Edward Jackowski , owner of Exude , a nationwide fitness training company based in New York City , and author of Hold It ! You 're Exercising Wrong . " If they warm up at all , it 's with a light set of bench presses , which does nothing but shock your muscles . " Lifting with cold , tight muscles is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout with the iron . <p> Quick Fix : " Break a sweat before you lift , " suggests Jackowski . Do n't worry about warming up particular muscles  --  what you need are some aerobic exercises that increase blood circulation to the entire body . Best aerobic warm-ups : 5 to 10 minutes of pedaling a stationary bicycle at between 60 and 90 revolutions per minute with the bike set at low to moderate tension ; 10 minutes of walking at a pace of 3 to 4 miles per hour ; 5 minutes of running at 5 to 7 miles per hour ; or 5 minutes of jumping rope . Mistake : Aching your back to complete a bench press <p> The top enemy of building stronger , bigger muscles is poor form . Without proper technique , you tend to cheat , which not only cuts into your strength gains but also increases your risk for injury . One of the most common of these mistakes , says Jackowski , is arching your back off the bench as you 're pressing up a heavy weight . " Arching is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Besides , it 's a surefire way to strain your back muscles . " <p> Quick Fix : Flatten your lower back against the bench as you press upward . There are two tricks to ensure that you do this : First , lower the poundage about 20 percent  --  that 's the typical extra amount of weight most guys try to lift that they ca n't handle . Second , bring your feet off the floor and place them flat on the bench , just in front of your buttocks . Doing so will help keep your lower back against the bench as you lift . Mistake : Using momentum to do a biceps cud <p> During a standing biceps curl with a barbell , men tend to bounce their hands off their thighs to help them cuff the weight upward . That 's cheating , and it is n't doing anything to make your muscles stronger . Quick Fix : <p> Lower the weight very slowly on the negative phase of the curl , using a count of 1-2-3-4 , and hesitate a split second after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncing or rocking . Mistake : Yo-yoing at cable stations <p> By their very design , the cable stations on weight-stack machines encourage a common mistake that Jackowski calls " yo-yoing . " It 's when you allow the descending weight to yank dangerously on your arms at the end of the move . <p> Quick Fix : Stay in control of the weight by working slowly and limiting your range of motion . On triceps push-downs , for example , press downward until your arms are straight , using a two-count . Then , ease the bar back up , very slowly , using a four-or even a five-count . And stop as soon as your hands reach chest level . Mistake : Rocking on a rowing machine <p> The most common error men make on a rowing machine is putting too much back and not enough legs into the stroke , risking injury to overused muscles and cheating idle ones out of a strength-building workout . " The correct rowing motion requires a precise sequence that you rarely see being used at your local health club , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national rowing team and a training consultant with Concept II , maker of rowing ergo-meters . " Guys tend to drive backward with their backs first , which wastes the power of the legs and can strain muscles . " <p> Quick Fix : Follow this sequence as you begin rowing : legs , then back , then arms . Keeping your upper body at a slight forward angle , first drive back with your legs and hips . Then lean slightly backward and pull the handle in toward your abdomen . On the return , follow the sequence in reverse , extending your arms and leaning forward before you bend your legs . Mistake : Overstriding while running <p> It would seem logical that lengthening your stride would help you run faster . But taking longer steps actually slows you down by creating a braking action every time your foot meets the ground . " Taking more steps , not longer ones , is the key to going faster , " says Jeff Galloway , a former Olympian and author of the perennial best-seller Galloway 's Book on Running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles and tendons , which can lead to injury . It 's estimated that about 20 percent of distance runners make this mistake . <p> Quick Fix : Taking more rapid steps will naturally shorten your stride . To monitor your progress , run around a track at a race pace and count the number of times your right foot strikes the ground over a minute . Research by SUNY-Cortland College running coach and exercise physiologist Jack Daniels , Ph.D. , suggests that the best rate for most runners , weekend and elite alike , is about 90 strides per minute . If yours is less than that , shorten up your gait and regularly monitor your pace . Taking shorter strides will feel awkward at first , but you 'll adjust within a few weeks . Mistake : Always standing up to cycle uphill <p> You 've been doing it since you were a kid : Come to a hill on your bike , and automatically , you 're out of the saddle , legs driving down , arms jerking the bike side-to-side in a sinuous weave . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really a huge waste of energy that 's not helping you get any stronger or get up the hill any quicker . <p> You need to approach hills with momentum and technique in mind , says John Howard , three-time Olympic cyclist and one of the most respected technicians in the sport . Attack the hill with as much speed as possible , keeping the wheels straight and remaining seated for as long as you can . <p> Quick Fix : As you near the hill , shift into an easier gear and slide back in your seat slightly . Concentrate on punching the pedals forward with the balls of your feet instead of hammering them straight down , which drives your energy into the ground . " Exiting the saddle should be your last resort , " says Howard . <p> PHOTO : SIDE BENEFITS : Instead of training with a kickboard , get a better leg workout by flutter-kicking on your side . For proper form , rest your surface arm against your hip . <p> By Jeffrey Csatari <p> THE 5 MOST ABUSED EXERCISES STANDING TOE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain on your hack and tightens the backs of your legs more than it relaxes them . It 's especially dangerous for anyone with lower-back problems . You 'll get a safer stretch by placing your right heel on a step in front of you , keeping your right leg straight and bending slightly forward from the hips until you feel slight tension in the back of your right leg . It helps to place your hands on your right thigh for support . Hold the stretch for 10 seconds . Then repeat with the left heel elevated . SITUP . Keep your hands crossed over your chest and bend your knees to reduce strain on your lower back . Curl up only until your shoulders are 4 to 6 inches off the floor . HURDLER 'S STRETCH . Bending one knee under you end extending the other leg out in front puts too much stress on the knee joint and its ligaments . Better : the figure-four stretch . Sit on the floor and straighten your right leg in front of you . Next , bend your left leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of your right thigh . Slowly bend forward and reach toward your right ankle , Hold for 10 seconds . Repeat with your left leg extended . FULL-CIRCLE NECK STRETCH . Doing neck circles too quickly can injure the vertebrae or disks in your neck . Safer : Looking straight ahead , slowly bend your head toward your right shoulder , then bring it back to upright position . Next , bend it forward , pause , then bring it back . Finally , slowly bend your head toward your left shoulder and bring it back to the starting position . Do not roll your head or lower it backward . DOUBLE LEG LIFT . You might think this gym-class perennial works your abs ; It doesn't. it only exercises the thigh muscles that attach to and flex the hip . If you want to firm up your gut , do reverse trunk curls . Lie on your back and bring your knees to your chest . Then cross your arms over your chest and contract your abdominal muscles ; the contraction will pull your knees toward your face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right and wrong positioning when exercising <p>
