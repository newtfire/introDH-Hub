A bill for small savers <P> Finally , some relief may be on the way for the inflation-battered small saver . Last week the Senate Banking Committee reported out a bill co-sponsored by Chairman William Proxmire of Wisconsin and Alan Cranston of California that aims at helping little depositors get a better return on their money . <P> The measure , which the full Senate is expected to vote on this month , would authorize interest-bearing checking accounts as of Sept. 30 , 1980 . Then the so-called NOW ( for negotiable order of withdrawal ) accounts , which savings and commercial banks have been offering in New England since 1972 and in New York for the past nine months , would be allowed to spread across the nation . <P> <P> The bill would also lower from $10,000 to $1,000 the minimum amount required to buy the popular six-month money-market certificates that were introduced in mid-1978 . A price cut in these certificates , which are pegged to the six-month Treasury bill rate , now 10.11% , would be heartily cheered by the estimated 70% of savers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high cost . <P> Chances that the Senate bill will become law seem no better than fifty-fifty . Reason : the bill would also change the federal banking law 's Regulation Q , which limits the interest that can be paid on deposits , currently 5% for passbook savings at commercial banks and 5% at savings banks . Under the bill , these ceilings could be raised by Y2 point a year over an eight-year period starting in 1982 and then eliminated entirely . But executives of savings banks and savings and loan associations argue that they can not compete against commercial banks for deposits if they lose their point interest-rate advantage . Also , they fear they will be unable to pay higher rates because they have many fixed-rate , long-term mortgages on which they get an average return of only 8.8% , while commercial banks are getting more than 13% on a large part of their shorter-term loans . <P> The bill 's backers , which include the Administration , reply that even now savings institutions are losing deposits because people are switching to money-market mutual funds , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure would allow savings banks to fatten their income by making short-term consumer installment loans , on which the rates can be as high as 18% . If the thrifts succeed in killing just the Regulation Q provisions of the bill , as seems possible , NOW accounts and $1,000 money-market certificates could both be available for all savers by the end of 1982.
