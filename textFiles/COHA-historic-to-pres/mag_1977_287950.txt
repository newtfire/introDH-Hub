Not the Devil but the Genes ? <P> <P> To the Editors . <P> <P> Sociobiology Aug. 1 , like other theories that deny the importance of the individual mind and conscience , will sweep the nation . Instead of saying , " The devil made me do it , " one can now be scientific and say , " I ca n't help it ; it 's in my genes . " <P> <P> David S. Bradburn <P> Manhattan Beach , Calif . <P> <P> Sociobiology may apply to ants , but your article reveals it as just another pop simplification when it is extended to people . Rational theories of human behavior have to be flexible enough to account for both a Stevie Wonder , able to triumph over being blind as well as black , and a Patty Hearst , so much a creature of her environment that she seems to have no genes at all . <P> <P> Christopher Wills <P> La Jolla , Calif . <P> <P> Women have never been invited into the war room of the Pentagon or the chambers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs because women are watching . They do it all for us , and it 's all our fault . Gol-leee fellas , do you really expect us to swallow that ? <P> The burning question which we are all trying to answer , including the sociobiologist yarn spinners , is : Will the human species be doomed to destroy itself ? <P> <P> Miki Bratt <P> Claremont , Calif . <P> <P> Sociobiology is obviously valid : in the proper hands , it could predict much with alarming accuracy . <P> Unfortunately , to quiet their alarm , the all-powerful majority will reject the discipline 's predictions . Like economics , linguistics and psychology before it , sociobiology will wind up as just one more haven for professional " explainers , " for those soothsayers whom we honor as scientists as long as their findings turn out to be soothing . <P> <P> Erika Engelhardt <P> Munich <P> I am not comfortable with the idea that 1 was put on this planet solely for the survival of the DNA sequences . <P> I would much rather believe I was placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely the boondocks of the universe . <P> <P> Sherry Clifton <P> Houston <P> About Abortion <P> In your Essay about abortion Aug. 1 , you seem to miss the point of the antiabortionists : we want to stop the killing of innocent human life . If we can only stop the poor from getting abortions , we may have to be satisfied with that , however " unfair " it may seem to those who consider killing a right at all . <P> <P> Joan K. McCoy <P> New York City <P> Abortion is not a social necessity ; it is a social luxury . Yes , abortion may improve the " quality of life , " but it will degrade us as human beings . <P> <P> Michael A. Fleming <P> Houston <P> An equitable solution to the abortion problem would be to place two small boxes on our tax returns , as we did for presidential campaign contributions . One could be checked by antiabortionists , who have a moral objection to abortion , to have their money used to support unaborted children of welfare recipients . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their tax money used for abortions for poor people . <P> <P> Mark S.
