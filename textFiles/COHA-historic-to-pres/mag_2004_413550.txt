That 's especially true in small bathrooms , where it 's often tempting to use many colors . " As long as a color is going to be paired with white , you can pick any color , " he says . A monochromatic color scheme unifies a variety of textures , materials , and forms to create a cohesive composition . This is especially advantageous in compact bathrooms , where a unified design can create the feeling of spaciousness .

Bright colors , like the yellow , green , and orange shown here , open up the space . These three bathrooms employ monochromatic palettes to create strong , simple statements .

Here are some other ideas . * Pay attention to scale , Architect Walter Metez uses small ceramic tiles as a backsplash to make a wall look monolithic . They create an enriching texture without adding distracting patterns . The grout lines of larger tiles can create a strong grid pattern that can overpower a small space . * Use restraint . Metez avoids vivid patterns , borders , or banding-which can make a small room appear busy . * be consistent . In Metez 's yellow bathroom , the top of the narrow cabinet lines up with the top of the tile , both of which line up with the bottom of the windowlike opening . The consistency unifies the disparate materials and brings a pleasing order to the small space . * Accent one feature . In Ortiz 's orange bathroom , the architect used the same glass mosaic tiles on the walls and the floor to set off the white sink . Vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www. /coWer.com or 800/456-4537 ) .
