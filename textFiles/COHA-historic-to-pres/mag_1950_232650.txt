East Berlin 's Reds last week staged a new play at the Kammerspiel theater to explain the U.S. Written by Gustav von Wagenheim , a resident of Moscow for twelve years , it is called Auch in Amerika ( In America Too ) , and dedicated " to Howard Fast and the youth of America who do not want war . " The setting : a peaceful , lakeside American cottage inhabited by grandfather ( wiped out by the big trusts ) , father ( worried about his $125,000-a-year job ) , mother ( worried about father ) and son Larry ( worried about everybody ) . <P> Larry is a " progressive student . " He has found out that father is not only an atomic scientist but a warmonger with Ku Klux Klan connections . Sample dialogue : <P> Larry : What do you know of father 's connections with General MacFarren ? <P> Mother : That does n't interest me . <P> Larry : Would n't it interest you that MacFarren has organized a secret Ku Klux group ? <P> Mother : And you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a respectable person . <P> Larry ( bitterly ) : That 's the respectable person who , in the year 1950 after Christ , drums lies into you that we must start a war to gain world leadership . <P> Mother ( hysterically ) : No war ! There shall be no war ! <P> Larry whips out a peace petition ; mother signs . Not so father , a tough capitalist , who angrily refuses , threatens mother with Klan vengeance , shuts up only when Larry pulls a gun on him . <P> Auch in Amerika opened to a packed house . At every political punch line , rhythmic rehearsed applause thundered from one section of the audience . Next day the Communist press dutifully trotted out reviews , though the chore was almost too much for Berliner Zeitung Critic Hans Ulrich Eylau , who cautiously wrote he thought the play 's denouement a little hard to take . Gulped Eylau : " This is not to be a critical final judgment . It is just the result of a first encounter with a play that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our scanty stock of political contemporary poetry .
