" Ever since gold was first found flowing in its rivers , the Shangri-La La of the West has been the object of as many gibes as fantasies : just over a century ago , Rudyard Kipling was already pronouncing that " San Francisco is a mad city , inhabited for the most part by perfectly insane people " ( others might say " insanely perfect " ) ; and more than 40 years ago , S.J. Perelman was barreling down the yellow brick road to L.A. , the " mighty citadel which had given the world the double feature , the duplexburger , the motel , the hamfurter , and the shirt worn outside the * pants .

For one thing , California wears its contradictions , its clashing hearts , on its sleeve : even its deepest passions are advertised on bumper sticker , T shirt and vanity plate .

So too , society in California is less a society than a congregation of subcultures , many of them with a membership of one : every man 's home is his castle in the air here . <P> In addition , California 's image has been fashioned largely by interlopers from the East , who tend to look on it as a kind of recumbent dumb blond , so beautiful that it can not possibly have any other virtues .
