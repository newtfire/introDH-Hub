Muslima cradles a scared chicken in her arms , tending to it with all the careful treatment due a precious object . She gently hands it to her teacher , Farima , who is lecturing a roomful of about 25 women on the best way to care for the bird . Farima 's students , all widows , are eagerly attentive . <p> Although long past school age , these women - most of whom have children of their own - have never been to school themselves . This dark , mud-walled room in Muslima 's home is their first classroom . They sit on the floor leaning against the walls , their faces lined in concentration . This poultry-raising class has the potential to guide them from unemployment to self-sufficiency . <p> In Afghanistan , where many families have lost husbands and sons during 23 years of continual warfare , widows have suffered a particularly severe fate . In a nation with a fractured infrastructure and , at $ 250 a year , one of the lowest per-capita incomes in the world , many widows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even modest financial support . <p> In Kabul alone there are an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 of these women . Only about one in five Afghan women can read and write , one of the lowest rates in the world . Uneducated , illiterate , and lacking basic job skills , many widows are left to fend for themselves . <p> During Taliban times , severe restrictions on women denied them the right to leave their homes . Even today , with the Taliban defeated , many Afghan women are still reluctant to step outside their houses , and traveling or walking anywhere without a male escort can be an uncomfortable experience for some . <p> Their attempts to earn a living usually mean fighting against societal taboos . Without education , these widows at best can only use the skills they know from home life . They might clean houses or become tailors . <p> The most desperate are reduced to begging or even to prostitution . <p> Food assistance helps , but it 's not enough <p> Aware of the widows ' plight , the international relief group CARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , approximately 10,000 widows and their families - about 60,000 people - receive food assistance every month . A large sack of wheat flour , a smaller sack of beans , cooking oil , and salt provide a family of five about half of their monthly food requirements . Home visits by aid workers confirm a family 's eligibility : a female-headed household with no property and at least two children , and no son older than 16 . A typical widow in the program is an illiterate 30-year-old with five children . <p> In a barren field on the edge of Kabul , an endless blue line of burqa-clad figures patiently wait their turn to show their documents and receive their monthly handouts . Samia Merza Mohammed , mother of six , heads out with her wheelbarrow full of foodstuffs . Her husband was killed 10 years ago . She has received food aid for seven years . <p> Yet as grateful as the widows are for the assistance , simply feeding them will not liberate them from a life of dependency . <p> " I used to wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't have any other job because I ca n't read or write . " <p> That 's why CARE 's program for Humanitarian Assistance for Women of Afghanistan ( HAWA ) includes vocational training and literacy classes designed for women like Muslima . <p> Widowed 11 years ago , with four children to feed , Muslima ( who like many Afghan women , only uses her first name ) was fortunate that her father-in-law supported her , but when he died two years ago , she faced destitution . Through this income-generating program , she is learning how to raise chickens so she can eat or sell their eggs . If she can earn just $ 1 a day , she can start supporting her family . <p> Poultry farming is just one of the classes the widows can take . CARE surveyed the women about their preferences for vocational training . At the top of the list were poultry raising and beauty-salon training . They also suggested carpet weaving , silk screening , spinning wool , engraving , and bagmaking . <p> Nafisa Nakara 's classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls a wooden bar across a silkscreen , letting the green paint pass onto the cloth through the spaces left open by a stencil . <p> Once a month Nafisa takes her widow 's card and joins the long line of women waiting for food handouts . Her husband died 13 years ago when a rocket hit their house . Since then , she has struggled to care for their three girls . Today she is a student in this silk-screening class . " I used to work as a maid and clean houses . During the Taliban time , we were n't allowed to leave our own homes to work , " says Ms. Nakara . " But , I would go out secretly to people 's houses and wash clothes , " she says . " Now , with President Hamid Karzai , we feel so much freer . When I joined the program , I saw that there was work that is much better than the work I used to do . " <p> Beauty salons big business <p> Across town in Fakhria 's beauty salon , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup . As Carmela brushes colored shadow on Ruya 's eyelids , the teacher 's young daughter Shabistan watches with admiration . <p> Afghan women love to fix up their hair and wear makeup despite the fact that a burqa will cover their hard work . The only men who will see their labors are their husbands or close male relatives . Still , beauty salons are big business . The walls of Fakhria 's salon are plastered with posters of heavily made-up Indian actresses . Afghan women model themselves on these women whom they perceive as beautiful and liberated . <p> Today 20 students receive their beauty certificates after completing a two-month class . The women are reimbursed for their travel expenses which is especially helpful to those from remote areas of Kabul . They " sign " their receipts with thumbprints since they can not write their own names . <p> Fakhria 's salon has been open for seven years , even during Taliban times . When the Taliban would take down her sign , she would put it up again - a small act of courage and defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs her own business and says she is proud to teach other women her trade so they , too , can be empowered . <p> Once their training is completed , CARE gives the women start-up kits of hairsprays , lipsticks , and other supplies needed to open their own salons . Eventually they will be asked to repay 70 percent of the value of the kit . Also , unless they can transform their living rooms into salons , they will need money to rent space . <p> To deal with such needs , CARE has mobilized some of the women into self-help groups , including savings groups linked to larger microfinancing programs funded by the World Bank . <p> By pooling their savings , the women are able to offer small loans to group members . In similar programs elsewhere , low-income women have proven to be good credit risks . <p> In some countries remarriage can resolve the economic problems of widows . But in Afghanistan this is most often not a viable option . <p> " Afghan people love their children . But most men would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are willing to get married to widows are very poor , " says Zeba Sharaf Malsidiqi , a distribution officer with the food program . <p> All of which adds further urgency to the poultry class held several times a week in Muslima 's living room . They have already built chicken coops in their backyards with donated materials . The 30 two-month-old chicks they each were given several months ago have grown into egg-producing hens . <p> Now in its second year , the poultry program is CARE 's most successful , with 1,500 widows participating . Already widows like Muslima have become self-supporting . The women appreciate being able to work at home , where they can also care for their families and avoid uncomfortable social situations . <p> " We are so happy to have chickens , " says Noorzia , pulling back her burqa in her excitement despite the fact that she must speak to a visitor through a male translator . Noorzia 's chickens give her the highest yield in the class , 18 or 19 eggs a day . <p> " By selling eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tea . Before , my clothes were dirty and I did n't have money to buy soap . I am so happy now that I have clean clothes . Now I can look after my children very well .
