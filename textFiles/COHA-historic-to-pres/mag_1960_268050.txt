THE LOSER ( 308 pp. ) - Peter Ustinov - Little , Brown ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> If Actor-Playwright Peter Ustinov were to ad-lib a novel on the stage or before a TV camera , it might turn out very well . With his wit , his storyteller 's flair and his crafty talent for wedding the ridiculous to the dramatic , he might easily become an important prose bard . But Ustinov wants to write . While he did reasonably well in his engaging 1957 comedy , Romanoff and Juliet , he failed badly last year in his book of short stories . Add a Dash of Pity . To his credit , Ustinov refuses to quit : he has written a first novel . <P> The mind that conceived The Loser is obviously steeped in good will . But as its author says when speaking of his Nazi non-hero : " As so often happens , pen and mind tell a different story . " Hans Winterschild , a Nazi infantry officer , is the loser of the title , and so , by reasonable extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the winners ? There are times when The Loser all but implies that the Allies would have been proved wrong , or so a cynic could argue . Hans is a case-history figure , a dedicated Nazi who never had to contend with conscience . When he is ordered to destroy an entire town , he does his part with no questions asked . Men , women and children are methodically shot down , the church burned with all who had gone there to seek sanctuary . To make his creaky plot hold together , Ustinov has Hans fall in love with a Florentine prostitute during the German retreat . When , quite out of character , he comes back to find her , he is sniffed out by the police and pursued as a war criminal . <P> The long chase proves that Author Ustinov has not yet mastered the art of creating suspense , but it does give him a chance to do what he does best : hold up national types to clever , cynical scrutiny . His police colonel is cast as a stock Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts cemented by Machiavellian guile . The head of the German escape ring could be found in Central Casting along with all the lesser characters . <P> Hans loses out , of course , but not until Ustinov has worked some of the most quixotic flimflam in recent fiction . Characters deliver speeches that are fluent and often funny but almost never credible . What The Loser leaves behind is a sense of regret that so many nice touches have been wasted , so much comic flair dissipated in a search for what is obviously a serious statement about war , its terrors and follies.
