M R. K*A-viA4D-449/ and the Glorious Pest The second of three stories by LEO ROSTEN Drawings by Karla Kuskin T H E N , amidst a breathless hush , " read Mr. Parkhill , amidst a breathless hush , " Patrick Henry took the floor . All eyes turned to the fiery young lawyer , who thereupon delivered the most scathing attack on monarchy yet heard in the Virginia House of Burgesses : ' Caesar had his Brutus , Charles the First his Cromwell , and George the Third ' ? cries of ' Treason ! Treason ! ' interrupted him ? ' and George the Third may profit from their example ! If this be treason , make the most of it ! ' " " Hooray ! " " Vunderfull " " Dat 's da way to talk ! " Mr. Parkhill lowered the text . He felt pleased , not only because the historic words always stirred his senses , but because the beginners ' grade , having listened with such intensity of interest , had responded with such amplitude of feeling . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most dramatic moments in the history of the thirteen colonies , Ten years later , Patrick Henry delivered another speech , which is even more memorable . It has , indeed , become one of the truly  --  er  --  immortal orations in history ! " He closed the book . He needed no lifeless text to prompt him in that glorious peroration : " ' Is life so dear , or peace so sweet , as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ? Forbid it , Almighty God ! ' " He paused . " ' I know not what course others may take , but as for me  --  give me liberty or give me death ! ' " If his disciples had applauded Patrick Henry on Monarchy , they brought the rafters down for him on Liberty . " Hoorah ! " " T'ree rhiss for Petrick Hanry ! " " Bravo ! Bravo ! " Miss Caravello was prartiea/1y on her feet , leading a parade . " Justa like Mazzini I " " Ha ! " The scorn of Hyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare a Petrick Hanry to a  --  vat vas dat name ? " " Mazzini ! Greata man . Botha patriot ! " " If in Italy ( ley had Petrick Hanry bifore , dey would n't have Mussolini rater ! " Mr. Kaplan gazed into space , transported , then flung his hand up in imperial command . " ' Give me liberty  --  or give me dad ' " " Good fa you ! " cried loyal Gidwitz . " Hoo ha ! " called star-struck Pinsky . " Keplen , you should absolute/ go in politics ! " " Class ... order , please . " Mr. Parkhill had to tap his pointer quite loudly on his desk before he could still his students ' ardor . But when the tribute due Patrick Henry was being accorded Hyman Kaplan , who had managed to utter the deathless words as if he were making them up on the spot , it was clearly time to intervene . " I shall now assign your homework . " A happy murmur moved across the ranks . Out came pencils to record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the Spartans before Leonidas at Thermopylae , or the proud 27 French legions before their Corporal at Marengo , so the thirty-odd stalwarts of the beginners ' grade of the American Night Preparatory School for Adults hearkened to Mr. Parkhill . " During this semester , " he began , " we have had occasion to discuss many different incidents in American history . We have not done this iner  --  chronological order , because I have tried to answer your questions as they arose . Besides , as you all know , American History is taught in Mr. Krout 's grade . " He did not stress the fact that Mr. Krout lay beyond the forbidding stretches of Miss Higby . " So it is that we discussed Woodrow Wilson , say , before we even mentioned the Monroe Doctrine ; or Thomas Paine before some of you even knew about Pocahontas . " He smiled ; it did sound amusing put that way . " In any event , we have covered quite a bit of ground . And so your assignment , for our next session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any famous incident , associated with the American Revolution . " " Pssh ! " cried Mr. Pinsky , slapping his cheek in a burst of admiration . " Too hard , " said Mr. Scymzak . " I lohve American ravolutions ! " announced Olga Tarnova , who hated the Bolsheviki . Mr. Parkhill 's most casual remarks sometimes had this electrifying effect  --  changing his students into Senators and the classroom into a forum . " A famous figure or incident associated with the American Revolution " elicited such a concatenation of approval and doubt , such cries of courage and premonitions of despair , that Mr. Parkhill felt as if he had not so much assigned an exercise as called a plebiscite . " Foist-class assignment ! " beamed Mr. Kaplan . " Too hard , " Mr. Scymzak repeated . " Hod but goodl " rejoined Mr. Kaplan sternly . " Who vants izzy lassons ? lzzy is for slowboats ! " " Slowpokes , ' Mr. Kaplan . " A heartrending wail escaped from Mrs. Moskowitz . " Which figures American Revolution ? Which accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ' accidents , ' " said Mr. Parkhill quickly . With Mrs. Moskowitz pedagogy was best practiced as if it were surgery : delay could be fatal . " My mind is blenk about incidents also , " mourned Mrs. Moskowitz . " Please  --  give alraddy exemples . " A hand of gallant friends rushed to give her succor . " Try crossing the Delaware ! " " Take maybe Benjamin Frenklin ? " " Liberty Bells ! " Mrs. Moskowitz shook her many jowls and groaned , wandering in Cimmerian darkness . " Maybe John Hencock ? " called Reuben Plonsky . " Spilling tea in Boston Hobber ? " " Do n't shoot till their eyes Loin white ! " Neither heroes nor events nor historic sayings could lift Mrs. Moskowitz out of the boundless mire . " Mrs. Moskowitz , " Mr. Parkhill began , " per-haps you ? " " Moskovitz , you not tryink ! " cried Mr. Kaplan . " Vat am I doing  --  svimming ? " " You holdink beck de clessl " " So go on witout me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ' Morale ; Mr. Kaplan , not ' morals , ' " said Mr. Parkhill anxiously . " Mrs. Moskowitz , I 'm sure the assignment is not quite as difficult as you think . " He gave her a smile intended to infuse confidence . " I 'm sure that after you get home , when you have lime to think about it , or review your notes , you will get many  --  er  --  ideas . " He was not at all sure that Mrs. Moskowitz would get any , much less " many , " ideas ; if any idea was to become part of Mrs. Moskowitz ' universe it would be because it found a way of taking possession of her , and not the other way around . The hand of Barney Kesselman waggled in the air . " How long should be this composition ? " Mr. Parkhill weighed his next wards carefully . " I do not want a long or  --  er  --  elaborate effort , class . Let 's say , oh , not more than a page in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , that third face between Washington 's , from which he often drew resolution , and Lincoln 's , to which he often repaired for condolence . It was two minutes to ten . " That is all for tonight . " N 0 W , two nights later , in the welcome solitude of his apartment , red marking pencil in hand , Mr. Parkhill was correcting their offerings . He did not know whether to feel pleased or disappointed . The prose of his novitiates was always full of surprises  --  some good , some bad ; but this batch of papers contained so many surprises that it was difficult to think of them as either good or bad ; they were just surprising . American history seemed to have plunged his fledglings into the most extraordinary personal involvements . Take Sam Pinsky , for example . Mr. Pinsky , a devoted but run-of-the-mill student , ordinarily 28 MR . KAPLAN AND THE GLORIOUS PEST did not let his reach exceed his grasp . This time , either inspired or intoxicated , Mr. Pinsky had thrown discretion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critique of the entire colonial policy of eighteenth-century England , and had become so incensed by what he called British " cold-heartiness " that he had soared into most untypical rhetoric : Colonists were starving , frizzing from cold , suffering like flys . But did British care ? ? ? No ! What they did ? They made taxis . Taxis , taxis , taxis . On fond . On tea . On sending even a postal card to a dying mother . Oh , how foolish was Georgie TIT . That was not at all the way Mr. Pinsky usually wrote . Or take Mrs. Rodriguez . For some reason Mrs. Rodriguez had taken personal offense at General Cornwallis ; for apart from making him the blackest villain of the War for Independence , she blamed him for not surrendering to Washington soon enough . Her composition was not so much an essay as an ultimatum , and Mr. Parkhill could not tell whether it had been designed to be descriptive of , or delivered to , the unfortunate Cornwallis . Or take Reuben Plonsky . Mr. Plonsky had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of crimes too heinous to be described , or , if described , to be spelled correctly . ( It was hardly fair , for instance , to blame the Tories for " encouraging violins " when the worst that could be said about them was that they sometimes met persecution with violence . ) Or take Mrs. Tomasic , whose Balkan forebears had survived oppressions beside which the Stamp Acts seemed philanthropic . Tiny Mrs. Tomasic had paid moving respect to that peerless seaman , " Admirable Grandpa Jones . " Mr. Parkhill could " What they did ? They made taxis . " see how a neophyte might confuse Admiral with " admirable , " but how Mrs. Tomasic had alchemized " John Paul " into " Grandpa " he simply could not fathom . After these erratic excursions into history , Rose Mitnick 's measured words came as both a pleasure and a relief . Her composition was entitled ' ' A Hero : Nathan Hale " and contained this moving passage : They tied his hands behind to hang Nathan . But brave , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also poetical . " I regret I have only one life to give for the country . " He was not maybe so important as Washington , but he is my hero . I admire . Why , save for the occasional omission of a pronoun , that paragraph might have done credit to a veteran of Miss Higby 's grade . Mr. Matsoukas ' paper , which he next assayed , had puzzled Mr. Parkhill . It had sung the praise of John Hancock , whose aid to the cause of freedom , wrote Gus Matsoukas , no red-blooded American would ever " forge . " It took quite a while for Mr. Parkhill to realize that Mr. Matsoukas had simply been careless ; only a " t " separated " forge " from " forget . " Miss Ziev , from whom Mr. Parkhill had not expected to get any homework at all , had come through with this perplexing paean : TO MINUTE MEN Farm men with long riffles . Always ready to fight . Did . Famous Wuxi , with I shot whole world heard , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The only way Mr. Parkhill could explain how Concord had become " Grand Concourse " was that some friend of Miss Ziev who resided on that broad thoroughfare had helped her with her homework . Mr. Studniczka  --  Mr. Parkhill sighed . Peter Studniczka had submitted yet another of his cryptic substitutions for prose : 1776 Best man ? G. Washington Bad man ? King and reps . Trators ? Ben Dick Arnold Patroit - PULASKI FROM POLAND ! Mr. Parkhill was not happy about that paper . Something in Mr. Studniczka 's mental processes seemed to make him approach English vertically . Whether it was because he actually thought in columns ( which Mr. Parkhill might understand were Mr. Studniczka , say , Chinese ) , or whether he suffered from some sort of phobia about whole , horizontal sentences , with a subject , verb , and predicate , Mr. Parkhill did not know . He sighed again . Mr. Studniczka had a long way to go  --  a long , long way to go . He corrected " trators " and " patroit , " and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not a composition , Mr. S. Please try whole sentences next time . " He started to put the paper aside , remembered something , and added : " Benedict Arnold . One man , not two . ' Then he picked up the next composition . Pellets of color popped before his eyes . They came not from a pang of migraine , nor from retinal hallucinations ; they came off the paper itself , from the title , which glittered with phosphorescent pride : HAMILTON VERSES TE FFER5ON A Play g4- /17* WA-0= rr Kf= The irrepressible author had , of course , sought to immortalize his name by printing the letters in red , outlining them in blue , and distributing gay green stars between . Mr. Parkhill put the paper down and took a drink of water . He sharpened his marking pencil thoughtfully before picking up Mr. Kaplan 's " A play ! " again . This is what his startled eyes beheld : Hamilton : " The government should be strong ! " Jefferson : " No ! Be ware strong government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha , ha , ha , ha . Do n't trust people . " Jefferson : " 1 TRUST ! Also , U.S. motto ' , saying ' God trusts . ' O.K. How 's about you ? " Hamilton : " You are a dreamy . Do n't be so nave . " Jefferson : ' Better to be dreamy . You are against MAN ! " At this point Mr. Kaplan , tiring under the weight of Anglo-Saxon nomenclature , had dropped into abbreviations which may have lessened the strain on his fingers but assigned disastrous connotations to his protagonists : Ham : " Every business needs a boss ! " Jeff : " From bosses come Kings ! Do n't forget ! " Ham : " That 's my last offer , Torn S. Jefferson ! " Jeff : " Same to you , L. X. Hamilton . " Mr. Parkhill felt a sharp pain in his head . He removed his spectacles and rubbed his eyes . Something would hove to be done about Mr. Kaplan  --  about his spelling , at least ; a student simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlandish phonetic approximations . " Tom S. Jefferson " indeed ? " L. X. Hamilton . . . " The colored flashes now were not occasioned by Mr. Kaplan 's crayons . G O 0 D evening , class , " said Mr. Parkhill pleasantly . " I shall return your homework , first . Each paper has been corrected and  --  er  --  evaluated . Please study the red pencilings carefully . You can probably learn more from your own mistakes than from almost any other exercise . " Mr. Kaplan raised his hand ; Mr. Parkhill braced himself . " Y-yes ? " " You liked de homevoik , Mr. Pockheel ? " " Well , " said Mr. Parkhill cautiously , " I think an of you tried very hard . There were , of course , many errors  --  too many , I fear . I shall now distribute ? " " Still , som homevoik maybe gave you a big soprise , " suggested Mr. Kaplan confidentially . Mr. Parkhill averted his gaze . He knew perfectly well what Mr. Kaplan was driving at . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the effect that imagination was more important than error , that one student had risen above his pedestrian fellows by soaring into the empyrean of drama . Mr. Kaplan 's pious expression even hinted that he would understand it if the public praises clue such a genius omitted his actual name , which might incur the ire of the envious . " Mr. Kaplan , " said Mr. Parkhill firmly , looking his most faithful and difficult apostle straight in the eye , " the purpose of homework is not to ' surprise . ' In fact , the best homework is the kind that , containing no errors , causes me no surprises whatsoever ! " And with that to quoque , Mr. Parkhill briskly proceeded to distribute the homework . " Miss Pomeranz ... Mr. Trabish ... " Mr. Kaplan looked crushed . How , looking crushed , he also managed to convey the untarnished pride of one who has scaled Parnassus , albeit in vain , was something Mr. Parkhill would never understand . " Miss Kipnis . . . Mr. Wilkomirski . " As the compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded Mr. Parkhill for his labors. " 1 spalled wrong ' Philadelphia ' ? " " George is not Georgie .. . " " Psssh ! Was I wrong ! " The resonance of a self-administered slap on the cheek told Mr. Parkhill that a dazzling light had dawned on Sam Pinsky . " Examine the corrections carefully , class . If 30 MR . KAPLAN AND THE GLORIOUS PEST you have a question , just raise your hand . " Mr. Parkhill strolled down the aisle . There was a world of difference , pedagogically , between sitting at the desk and strolling down the aisle : The one was judiciary , the other egalitarian ; the one enforced decorum , the other encouraged relaxation . The next hour went so swiftly that the bell rang before anyone suspected it was time for recess . And then , during the very closing minutes of the night , that crafty demon who confounds the plans of teachers no less than those of mice and men sent his seneschals among the innocent . Mr. Parkhill was conducting a spelling drill which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud : twenty words containing " e-i-g-h-t " ( from " freight " to " weight " via " height " ) , and twenty containing " o-u-g-h " ( from " cough " through " rough " to " through " ) . He had just announced " Bought . . . thought . . . enough " when Mrs. Moskowitz gave a cry of defeat , flung down her pen , and piteously appealed to Miss Kipnis beside her : " ' Enough ' ? Enough ! Why dey du n't put in ' f ' when is pronounced ifFi ? A mind creeks from sock torture , Cookie ! " " You got to be patient , " sighed Cookie Kipnis . " Learning takes time , " pleaded Miss Mitnick . They had reckoned without the defender of the faith . " Ha ! " scoffed Hyman Kaplan . " U. S. vas n't fonded by sissies ! " " I du n't want to fond ; I want to spall ! " protested Sadie Moskowitz . " Class ? " " Nottink good is fizzy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and planty easy ! " " You compare spallink to ittink ? " Mr. Kaplan 's expression set a new high for amazement . " You tritt English like lemb chops ? " " The way you talk , it 's chop sucy ! " snapped Mr. Plonsky , and his cohorts burst into laughter . " Class , class , " said Mr. Parkhill . " We are engaged in a spelling drill , not a debate ! " He waited for the echoes of combat to die away , then addressed Mrs. Moskowitz sympathetically . " I can well understand how someone from another land must feel when confronted by someof the  --  er  --  peculiar ways in which our English words are spelled . " " I am fromm anodder lend , " said Mr. Kaplan promptly , " an ' still do n't holler ' HaIp ! ' " " Mr. Kaplan , " said Mr. Parkhill testily , " English is a difficult language . And many of our words are spelled in most unreasonable ? " " Moskovitz can still make a good profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Parkhill looked up . What on earth was that ? He frowned . " I beg your pardon . " Mr. Kaplan looked as blank as an oyster . " I thought , " said Mr. Parkhill , " I heard you say that Mrs. Moskowitz could  --  er ? make a good profit ? ' " Mr. Kaplan nodded . " I mant like de Fonding Folders . " This was too much for Miss Mitnick , who twisted her handkerchief and beseeched him , " What have Fonding Fathers to do with Mrs. Moskowitz ? " " It 's obvious , " said Mr. Kaplan carelessly . " Ob ? " " Mr. Kaplan , " Mr. Parkhill cut in drily , " your comment is as unclear to me as it is to Miss Mitnick ! I suggest you explain  --  no , no , you need not go to the front of ? " The admonition came too late . ( Where Mr. Kaplan was concerned any admonition seemed to come too late . ) The bard of the beginners ' grade was midway between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some homing instinct irresistibly propelled him . He stopped , turned , and fixed Mrs. Moskowitz with narrowed eyes . " De Pilgrim Fodders did n't go heck to England bccawss dey had to spall ' enough ' ! " he cried , then transferred his scorn to Miss Mitnick . " Dey had beeger trobbles . Indians , messecres ? " " Mr. Kap ? " " ? spyink fromm de Franch , poisicutions fromm de British ? " " Professor Kaplen , stop giving a lecture in American history ! " howled Mr. Plonsky , smiting his forehead . " Stick to Mrs. Moskowitz ! " shouted Mr. Blatt-berg . Mr. Kaplan , a Triton among minnows , was deaf to their protestations . " An ' ven de time came for de Amarican Ravolution , brave men like John Hems , Tom Spain , James Medicine ? " " It 's Thomas Paine , Mr. ? " " ? knew vas still tuissink a slogan , a spok ! So along came Petrick Haney . " Mr. Kaplan 's eyes went dreamy . " Dat vas a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

So Petrick Hanry got don on de floor ? " " ' Took the floor ' ! " said Mr. Parkhill in alarm . " Took de floor  --  denk you  --  an ' in beauriful voids , parful voids which comm don dc santuries for all Amaricans who got true blood , he sad ? " " True-hlooded ' ? " Mr. Parkhill was getting desperate . " ' Julius Scissor had his Brutis , Cholly de Foist had his Cornvall , an ' if Kink Judge got a bren in his had he vill make a profit from soch a semple ! ' " Mr. Parkhill sank into his seat . " Dat , " Mr. Kaplan concluded , " also epplies to Moskovitzl " " Omigott ! " someone exclaimed . " All I sad was ' enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailed poor Mrs. Moskowitz . " Koplan , you mad ! " fumed Gus Matsoukas . " This mon will change the heestory singlehonded . " That , perhaps the truest thought yet uttered , came from Olga Tarnova . " I hoid enough , " Mr. Plonsky groaned , and put his head between his hands . " Mr. Kaplan . . . " Mr. Parkhill began . But he scarcely knew where to begin , so he began again . " Mr. Kaplan , I have rarely heard so many mispronunciations in so short a span of time . " He knew he was being quite severe , but he did not shrink before stringent measures . " Charles the First is not ' Charley the  --  er  --  Foist . ' Cromwell is not ' Cornwall . ' And what Patrick Henry said was most certainly not what you quoted ! There is a world of difference between ' George the Third may profit from their example ' and George the Third can make a profit out of such a sample ' ! " Indeed the enormity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A STORY BY LEO ROSTEN 31 the difference washed out of Mr. Parkhill 's conscience the slightest vestiges of remorse for his tone . " Do you understand , Mr. Kaplan ? " Mr. Kaplan murmured , " My ! " , cocked his head , signifying attention , ' closed his eyes , indicating cerebration , opened one eye , denoting illumination , and said " Aha ! " , proclaiming conversion . Then , with a rueful yet noble sigh , he started for his seat . " Still , I vill alvays edmire de glorious pest . " Miss Mitnick , who was getting more pale and more resolute by the moment , promptly pro-tested ; " Mistake ! In pronunciation . ' Past ' is not ' pest ' ! " Mr. Blattberg laughed , Mr. Wilkomirski guffawed , Miss Tarnova choked . " Tonight is averybody an axpert ? " Mr. Kaplan inquired caustically . Tonight Miss Mitnick summoned all her courage to rejoin , " You do n't have to be expert to know ' past ' from ' pest ' ! " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room rocked with merriment . " Good for you , Miss Mitnick ! " " Bravissimo ! " cried Carmen Caravello . " You got Kaplen ! " " Et lest ! " Mr. Kaplan ignored the petty barbs and puny arrows , and turned to the one who had been foolhardy enough to give him the challenge direct . " Mitnick , " he said pityingly , " you vould be corract , in usual soicomstences . But dis time , no . You are talkink abut prononrink ; I am talkink abot history . " " ' Past ' means history ! " Miss Mitnick said tearfully . " You said ' glorious pest ' . " " Kaplen , give op ! " crowed Mr. Blattberg . " Keplan , sit down ! " brayed Mr. Plonsky . " Koplan wrong , wrong !

He did not need to hear Mr. Kaplan 's next words to recognize the trap into which he , like poor Miss Mitnick , had so gullibly fallen . " To a tyrant like Kink Judge , " declaimed Hyman Kaplan , " vat else vas Petrick Hanry capt a glorious pest ! " After that , twenty words with " o-u-g-h " seemed an inglorious nuisance .
