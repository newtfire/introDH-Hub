Of all the differences that beset Franco-American relations , nothing angers Charles de Gaulle more than the U.S. 's refusal to help him build his atom bomb . Time after time , French officials have shown up in Washington with shopping lists for nuclear equipment and other gadgetry needed by De Gaulle 's proposed force de frappe ( striking force ) , only to be turned away . Last week , President Kennedy publicly , and emphatically , gave the French another no . <P> Occasion for the latest turndown was last month 's visit to the Pentagon by General Gaston Lavaud , chief of procurement for the French Defense Ministry . He brought with him a reply to repeated Washington appeals that NATO nations do more of their military purchasing from American firms to help the U.S. 's gold drain . " You need dollars . Here is what will get you dollars , ' ' said Lavaud , handing U.S. officers a list of things that France would like to buy . It included equipment for a gaseous diffusion plant to make enriched uranium , plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles . <P> The Blackball . Sympathetic Pentagon officials recommended White House approval ; even General Maxwell D. Taylor . Kennedy 's personal military adviser , came back from his European tour urging that the restrictions against France be relaxed . The soldier 's argument : concessions to De Gaulle might soften his three-year-old ban on stationing of U.S. nuclear warheads in France , might induce him to put returning troops from Algeria under NATO command . But the State Department 's advice - and Kennedy 's own inclination-was to refuse . Let De Gaulle first make good his old NATO promises , they argued ; moreover , including France in the small " nuclear club " would only bring additional claimants like the West Germans running to demand the Bomb for themselves as well . As Kennedy put it last week , the U.S. is " very reluctant to see the proliferation of nuclear weapons . " <P> But the French are grimly determined , with or without outside help , to go ahead with their atomic striking force . De Gaulle has conducted four atomic test explosions in the Sahara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be delivered by an airplane . At the big Dassault factories , work is under way on the Mirage IV bomber , a two-seat jet that can reach Mach 2.4 ( 1,590 m.p.h. ) over a 2,000-mile range . Fifty of these , combined with the smaller , slower Mirage III , will make a considerable new foe for the Communists along about 1965 . The first French-made A-bombs may well be installed in a few Mirage IVs next year . <P> Good Memories . Since the force de frappe is inevitable , why , ask the French , should the U.S. not help make De Gaulle 's task easier and cheaper ? One reason is the McMahon Act , the law that forbids giving U.S. nuclear secrets to any nation not already in possession of the bomb. * But France argues that Kennedy 's officials go far beyond the McMahon Act 's intentions ; often , say the French bitterly , the U.S. has blandly used the simple administrative device of refusing export licenses on some commodities that have nothing to do with nuclear secrets , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
