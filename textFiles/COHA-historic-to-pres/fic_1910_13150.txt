A kitchen . At the right an ironing-board , with full clothes-basket on the floor . At the back an open door , an open window with blooming plants on its outside sill , and a wide cupboard with a figured calico curtain before it . At the left an exit into a shed . A wooden bottomed rocker with high back and calico cushion , some wooden bottomed straight chairs , a table covered with a red cloth and ranged with four or five lamps , and at the corner farthest from the ironing-board , clothes-bars spread with a few freshly-ironed pieces . By the window , left back , sits Grandma who does not leave her chair throughout the play until its end . She is very old . She is in bright-coloured calico , with ribbons on her black cap . She is cutting and winding white and black carpet rags , and a basket of the balls is beside her on the floor . Mis ' Diantha Abel is ironing at the board . She has on a blue calico gown , a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with faded flowers and a dilapidated ostrich feather . She irons slowly , as anybody would iron , tests her flat-iron , starts for the shed to renew it at the stove out there . GRANDMA Looking up . Seems to me Inez is a terrible long time gettin ' that starch . DIANTHA I wish she 'd hurry herself back . I ai n't got enough starch to do the collars . p. 3 GRANDMA I 'll cold-starch ' em for you , if you want . DIANTHA No , Grandma , you jest set still and take care o ' yourself . Do n't you go botherin ' about other folks 's work . GRANDMA I 'm terrible tired cutting up carpet rags . Mis ' Abel disappears in the shed . Grandma , sorting her rags , talks on , raising her voice to follow Mis ' Abel . ' Tai n't as though they was goin ' to be rugs . We got rag rugs all over the house now . So has everybody else we know . Everybody 's floors is plastered with ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' doin ' nothin ' . . . Mis ' Abel returns with her fresh iron , testing it as she comes . . . but cuttin ' rags . Seems like I 'd ought to be able to make somethin ' else with my fingers . Somethin ' human . Where you goin ' , Dianthy ? DIANTHA I 'm a-goin ' to get this ironin ' out of the way , short off . That is , I am if Inez ever gets back from Mis ' Ellsworth 's with that cup o ' starch . GRANDMA What you got your hat on for ? DIANTHA So 's if anybody runs in they wo n't set half the day , henderin ' me . They 'll think I 'm goin ' off . GRANDMA I know . The neighbours do hender terrible . A pause . Sometimes , though , I think it must be kind o ' nice to have somethin ' to be hendered at . p. 4 DIANTHA Ironing  --  but not fast . I always say mornin 's is wove and cut out for hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody comin ' in an ' settin ' the whole forenoon . This ironin 's got to be got out of the way this mornin ' , no matter what happens to who . Her iron sticks , and she rubs it vigorously on the carpet . GRANDMA Who has dropped her work and is reaching to pick dead leaves off the plants in the window . I do n't seem to have no go in me no more . I do n't know what 's come over me . I ai n't no more interested in them carpet rags than I am in the dipthery . Ezra Williams appears at the open window . He is large and flushed and furious . WILLIAMS Mis ' Abel ! Mis ' Abel ! DIANTHA Looks at him , then turns and goes on ironing . Well , Ezra , as a family , we ai n't deef . WILLIAMS Is this you folks 's wood out here ? DIANTHA Over shoulder . Wood ? WILLIAMS I want to know if you folks ordered any cord wood ? p. 5 DIANTHA No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've brought you some . Only they 've unpiled it in front of my door on the piece that 's new-seeded and that I 've tended like a baby . DIANTHA Ezra , you 're that reasonable that I s'pose it 's reasonin ' that keeps you so calm . That wood never heard of us . WILLIAMS You sure ? DIANTHA Not as sure as you are about things . You do n't often find folks as sure as that . But  --  sure . WILLIAMS Well , it 's somebody 's fool wood , an ' I 've got to go an ' find the fool that ordered it up  --  He strides off , still talking . Whoever heard o ' anybody gettin ' cord wood in , anyhow , in the middle o ' the summer ? Grandma , who has stopped picking off dead leaves and has listened attentively during his stay , looks after him till he disappears ; then she turns . GRANDMA What did he say ? DIANTHA Did he talk too soft for you , Grandma ? GRANDMA He was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . DIANTHA Oh , well , he was just talkin ' to hear himself talk . About some cord wood . p. 6 GRANDMA It do n't seem as if anybody could be so interested in cord wood . DIANTHA They ai n't nothin ' in the world for Ezra but just Ezra . Nothin ' in the world for him but just  --  him . GRANDMA Looking off . Do n't you s'pose there is ? It do n't seem like they 's enough to anybody to occupy ' em the whole time . Up to the open door comes Peter . He is tall , awkward , grave ; long , uncovered wrists , heavy , falling hands ; but he has an occasional wide , pleasant , shy smile . PETER On the porch . Good morning , Mis ' Abel . DIANTHA Oh , good morning , Peter . I just happen to be ironin ' a flat-piece , so I do n't have to put my mind on it . I 'm goin ' to do the collars next pointedly , and they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat . Any groceries this morning , Mis ' Abel ? DIANTHA Groceries ? PETER Nods and enters . I 've started takin ' orders for Ferguson . p. 7 DIANTHA Well , I 'm glad to hear that . When do you start ? PETER To-day . DIANTHA Does many order to the door ? PETER I du n no . I 've just started . I 'm just startin ' . Now . DIANTHA Rubbing her iron on the carpet . I ai n't doin ' no orderin ' to-day . We 've got to eat up what we 've got . Unless you want to bring me fif ' cents worth o ' granulated sugar . You might do that . Get up there and get me that basket of odds an ' ends on the top of the cupboard . Seems to me I see a piece o ' beeswax up there . PETER Finishes writing down the order for sugar and brings a chair from near Grandma 's chair . I thought I 'd just stop in an ' see . You do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she would n't want anything this morning , would she , Mis ' Abel ? DIANTHA Who 's she ? Who you talking about ? PETER Why , Inez . DIANTHA I thought it was Inez . Why did n't you say so in the first place ? I hate di-plomacy in man or beast . p. 8 PETER Who has not quite reached the cupboard with the chair , sets it down and turns abruptly . Well , then , I 'll say it now . Mis ' Abel ! Why do n't she treat me right ? DIANTHA Treat you right ? Peter , his momentary courage going , takes the chair on over to the cupboard , turns , nods mutely . Why , I do n't see how she can . Near as I can make out , you never open your head when you 're with her . PETER Climbing on chair . It 's funny about me , Mis ' Abel . From the chair . Honest , I du n no what to do about me , sometimes . DIANTHA Well , stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . I do try to . But when I try to think how to stop myself thinking about myself , there 's myself thinkin ' about me . DIANTHA Think about somethin ' else , then ! Get me down that basket . You can stand and talk to me all day . I do n't see why you ca n't talk to her . PETER Reaching for basket . I could talk all right enough . But my tongue wo n't . I could  --  but my tongue , it wo n't . Turns with the basket . Why , some girls I know I can jolly like the dickens . But Inez  --  when she comes along , Mis ' Abel , I ca n't remember anything I know . Has down the basket and turns with it in his hands . History now  --  I know a real lot of history . And about birds and things . I 'd like to talk with her about them . But last week , when I took her to the picnic , I could n't think out any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes a large gesture with the basket at a perilous angle . p. 9 DIANTHA With a quick movement to catch the basket . Well , do n't ask me to tell you how to court . Men that do n't know history from a coach-and-four can court successful . Hunting for beeswax in the basket . But you ca n't expect Inez to know whether she likes you or not if you sit like a block . Say something  --  do something , so 's she 'll know you 're alive . PETER Despondently , as he climbs down . I know it . I ai n't much . An ' what little I am do n't show through somehow . He drags the chair back to its place beside Grandma in Mis ' Abel 's assenting silence . Sets the chair down with a bang . Honest , Mis ' Abel , I would n't care much what happened to me . Grandma looks up at him , and drops a ball of carpet rags . Peter picks it up and it unrolls away from him toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's laugh , shrill , but not unkindly . PETER Miserably . I guess I am a joke . GRANDMA Joke nothin ' . You 're a human . You 're a human an ' you do n't know it . I see a-many in my day . DIANTHA Waxing her iron . Well , a body need n't be a fool if they are human . My goodness , if Inez do n't get here with that starch  --  Inez comes up on the porch . She is slight , and very girlish . She wears a straight , dull reddish gown . She is hatless and excited . p. 10 INEZ With marked and slightly ironical sweetness to Peter , who is almost at the door . So sorry to have missed you , Peter . Good-bye , then . Mother ! Guess ! DIANTHA Ironing . Guess what ? I 'm too busy . INEZ Well , but listen . It 's important . It 's awful  --  DIANTHA Pausing , iron in hand , and looking over her shoulder . Well , out with it . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for ? INEZ It 's Mis ' Ellsworth 's sister . She 's died out West . And they 're sending her little boy out here to Mis ' Ellsworth . DIANTHA Setting down her iron . My land a living ! Carry Ellsworth with a boy on top of everything else ! INEZ I know it . She just heard last night . And she 's home trying to think what to do . DIANTHA When 's he going to get here ? INEZ To-night . To-night on the 7:58 . DIANTHA Pushing her hair back and taking her hat with it . Ai n't that just the end of everything ? p. 11 INEZ And her with nobody to do a thing for her . PETER Who has dropped the ball again at sight of Inez , has been making more and more of a tangle of the carpet rags ever since she entered . They could n't anybody do anything , could they ? INEZ Well , of course they could ! There 'll be things for everybody to do that knows her . Peter comes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and Inez talk apart , he awkward and mostly mute , she evidently mocking him as they try to disentangle the rags . DIANTHA Has walked over toward Grandma and stands , one arm akimbo . Did you understand , Grandma , Carry Ellsworth 's sister 's boy is coming to live with her . With disapproving emphasis . GRANDMA Boy ? A little boy ? DIANTHA Yes , sir . To-night . Comin ' to-night on the 7:58 . GRANDMA Placidly . Ai n't that nice ? DIANTHA Nice ? And her all alone in the world ? p. 12 GRANDMA Yes . Him comin ' and her all alone . She wo n't be alone no more . I wish't I was younger and could do for one . DIANTHA My land , I should think you 've had enough to do for . I guess you never had no peace till you come into our family that you did n't begin by belongin ' to . GRANDMA Bursting out . Peace ! That 's it . Now I 've got peace . Peace an ' carpet rags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ball of carpet rags a vicious throw through the shed door . DIANTHA Harking back . Nice . You think it 's nice . Why , Carry Ellsworth wo n't know what to do with a boy no more than nothing in this world . I du n no what she is goin ' to do to dress him . INEZ Turning with the properly wound ball . We 'll have to think of somebody that 'll have some cast-off clothes . DIANTHA Impatiently . Boy 's duds makes awful good weather strips . Before we got the upstairs plastered I use ' to wish I 'd had a boy or two . It 's goin ' to be an awful nuisance , doin ' for him . There 's some of your pa 's clothes she might use . I dunno 's it 'll need clothes first pop , though . But they 's everything to think of  --  Peter starts forward , his face bright with what he means to try to say . p. 13 PETER Oh , Inez . . . . That is , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean I was a boy . I mean I 've got some trousers  --  and a coat  --  and another coat . Shall I get ' em ? DIANTHA What do you mean  --  something to cut over ? Well , get ' em , of course . What you standing there for ? Get ' em and bring ' em here . Inez , you run over an ' ask Mis ' Trot to come in for a minute . Mind you say a minute , or she 'll set the whole forenoon . PETER At the door . Are you comin ' now , Inez ? I  --  I go that way too . INEZ Airily . Oh , do n't you wait for me , Peter . I 've got some things to see to . Exit Peter , looking at her dumbly . INEZ Mother , has n't Peter got any lungs ? DIANTHA Lungs ? INEZ Or maybe it 's brains . He looks nice enough  --  he looks real nice . But he acts as if he did n't have good sense when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way . INEZ Indignant . Father ? p. 14 DIANTHA Certainly . After we was married , whenever he begun actin ' like he knew it all , an ' like I was n't nothin ' but the fly-leaf o ' things , I used to remember how perfectly simple he did use ' to act when I first knew him  --  when he was first makin ' up . An ' many 's the time I 've just laughed to myself , and gone and done like he told me to , sheer through rememberin ' how simple and scairt and green he did use to act . INEZ Softly . Father ? Father ! DIANTHA Him . Now run for Mis ' Trot and do n't be lettin ' me let my spare room pillow shams dry . I guess I 'll carry this one in here out o ' the dirt . Exit with sham . GRANDMA Daniel was like that too . He done things regular greenhorn . I remember the day we was engaged , he almost made such a botch of it I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Will you ? " an ' I thought he meant would I go to the huskin ' bee and I said , " Yes . " When I see my mistake  --  well , I let it go at that . I see what hard work he was makin ' of it . INEZ That was old uncle Daniel , was n't it ? I remember him . He was awful old . GRANDMA Well , but I bet he was consider'ble more up to snuff than your young popinjays is now ! p. 15 INEZ Hastily . Oh , yes . Oh , I know  --  She retreats to the door and is met on the threshold by Mis ' Elmira Moran . Oh , good morning , Mis ' Moran . Come in . Mother 'll be back in a minute . Sit down . Exit . MORAN Stout , sixty , gets about with difficulty . She has a scarf wound many times about her head , but no shawl . Unwinds scarf deliberately and sinks in rocker as she speaks . I du n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can hardly hobble . And my left shoulder do n't get no better . Nor my head  --  it do n't act right . I du n no but my time is come and my grave is diggin ' around the next corner . I feel that way . I told Jake so . Enter Mis ' Abel . DIANTHA Good mornin ' , Mis ' Moran . Ai n't it just perfectly dreadful about  --  MORAN Dreadful ! I du n no what I am goin ' to do if it keeps up . I was just sayin ' , I said so to Jake only this mornin ' . I says , " Jake , " I says , " I 'm gettin ' so that I 'm su'prised whenever I wake up alive . Whenever I do it , " I says , " it 's like every blessed mornin ' of my life was a genu-ine resurrection for me . I feel it . " DIANTHA What you talkin ' about ? p. 16 MORAN If that ai n't just like Jake 's treatment of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake asked me if I 'd remembered to set the pancakes . Said he did n't hear me do it . DIANTHA Well , but land , land  --  what 's that got to do  --  MORAN I 'd been goin ' to tell him about my back , but I had n't the heart . I just laid and cried . Mis ' Abel , my back 's been behavin ' so queer , I can hardly move it . Why , the last few days  --  DIANTHA Positively . Just you put your finger on the place , Elmiry Moran , till I tell you the news . Carry Ellsworth 's got a baby . MORAN Sits bolt upright suddenly and with ease . A what ? DIANTHA Yes , sir . It ai n't here yet . It 's due to-night . MORAN Rises , steps toward Mis ' Abel easily and eagerly . What under the sun do you mean , Dianthy Abel ? Carry Ellsworth 's goin ' to have a baby . . . DIANTHA To-night . On the 7:58 . Her sister 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're sending him to her . MORAN Limps slowly back to her chair . You 'd ought not to give me them turns , Dianthy . The doctor says I must n't forget for a single minute the condition I 'm in . How old is he ? p. 17 DIANTHA Well , let me see . . . . Inez appears in doorway with Mis ' Trot . Mis ' Trot is little and " wiry " and active and alert . She comes in with a collar in one hand and a brooch in the other . INEZ Here 's Mis ' Trot , Mother . MIS TROT Well , did you ever hear anything like it , ever ? Carry Ellsworth , of all the folks under the canopy . DIANTHA That 's just exactly what I said . INEZ Going to table where lamps are ranged and beginning to clean them . How much does she get a month now ? MIS TROT At the mirror over the shelf , putting on her collar , speaks with the brooch between her lips . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband 's leg . DIANTHA And then of course whatever she earns substitutin ' clerkin ' , when clerks are sick . MORAN But barrin ' Christmas week I do n't believe that amounts to shucks for pay . MIS TROT Drawing up as a matter of course to help Inez with the lamp chimneys . It struck me all of a heap . An ' we 'd just found a buffalo bug in the parlour carpet . Yes , sir . A buffalo bug . In my parlour . I tried to step on it  --  but you know how they are . No corpse to ' em whatever . I could n't tell whether I hit it or not  --  and they always run like horses . I 've come right off an ' left him there , if he is there . I would n't of done such a thing , but , thinks I , what 's Carry Ellsworth goin ' to do ? How old 's this child ? p. 18 DIANTHA That 's what we was figurin ' when you come in . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kane house  --  no , that was Elmira , was n't it ? I guess Lucretia was n't married till the next year . We was livin ' in the Mitchell house . MORAN I thought you lived in the Mitchell house before you lived in the Kane ? Was n't you livin ' in the Mitchell house when our barn burned ? MIS TROT N  --  o . That peculiar , long-drawn " no , " with a sound of d in the n . You was n't . Why  --  to Mis ' Moran  --  your barn never burned till the winter I was livin ' alone . I remember wakin ' up alone in the house and seein ' the glare . DIANTHA I know we was livin ' in the Mitchell house when Lucretia was married because I remember runnin ' acrost home for more spoons durin ' the ceremony . I know I missed my cry altogether , ' count o ' not gettin ' back till the congratulations . I 'd hid my spoons in the spare room closet and I come over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed up and I could not remember where I 'd put them . Let 's see that was six  --  seven  --  eight  --  MORAN Oh , that was n't more'n seven years ago this summer . Because we bought out the Sparks grocery most eight years ago , an ' I remember sellin ' Hackett Ellsworth the five pounds o ' rice . p. 19 MIS TROT Why , Mis ' Moran  --  it was all of eight years ago . You forget how Time flies . I 'd a said nine , to be on the safe side . DIANTHA Yes , it must a been eight years ago . I know it was the year Inez had her first ready-made suit . Yes , Carry 's boy must be about six-seven years old . It do n't seem possible . INEZ Carry ? I thought you said Lucretia 's wedding ? DIANTHA Well , Carry was married right after . She had n't meant to be so soon . But her father did n't want to put up the parlour stove so long 's the girls was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall to save the bother of a stove weddin ' . MORAN Six-seven years old . Land , land . Just the hard age to take care of , when they begin to be smart . What is she goin ' to do ? DIANTHA Just his mere victuals is an item . MIS TROT Sighing . Yes , sir . Another mouth is another mouth excep ' when it 's a boy 's mouth . Then it 's a regular bureau drawer . MORAN This is goin ' to be an awful pull for the poor thing . She would n't take money , though , I do n't suppose , even if anybody had any to offer her ? p. 20 INEZ Oh  --  not money ! MIS TROT No  --  the last way to help anybody is to give ' em money . MORAN Well , of course Carry 'll look to us all to advise her some . MIS TROT Oh , I du n no but advice is next worse than money . DIANTHA Well , it 's goin ' to be a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should say the thing she needs is a job . But while she 's gettin ' it she 'd ought to have some clothes and some extry bedding and I du n no what all . And you know what that means  --  attemptin ' to get together truck like that . MIS TROT I could a done a little somethin ' to-day if it had n't been for that buffalo bug . But as it is I must n't stay a minute longer . That animal 'll be up into my lace curtains . How you goin ' to go at gettin ' the stuff together ? DIANTHA Ironing hard . Well , I do hate to load it onto her in tied-up bundles at the back door . I du n no but we 'd ought to go to the trouble of a pound party or somethin ' like that . MIS TROT Looking up with changing expression . That would be kind of nice  --  would n't it ? p. 21 DIANTHA Carry did n't have much of any wedding presents . And she never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set foot in her house to any real occasion excep ' a funeral . Turns with her iron in her hand . S'posin ' we was to give her a kind of a shower ? MORAN A what ? A shower ? MIS TROT Like they have for babies ? INEZ Oh , no . I know what Mother means . Like they have for brides . DIANTHA Sets down her iron , turns and leans against the ironing-board . Puts pillow sham on chair-back . I mean a shower  --  whether for bride , babe , or just anybody . It would be a lot of back-aching work , but we could make it real nice for her . GRANDMA Who has worked on , without looking up , until Mis ' Abel has said " shower . " Then she has listened . So you could . Go on and do it . Seems to me you could make it so sort of sociable and friendly it would n't seem a bit nasty , like charity does . MIS TROT Looking away , with expression growing more rapt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the child gets here . But that 's to-night . Of course you could n't do that . p. 22 MORAN Well , of course , I ca n't do a thing on account o ' my back . But I should think if you could scrape the things together to-day so 's to take ' em with you when you go , you could have it to-night all right . MIS TROT Sitting upright  --  not suddenly , but still with her rapt manner , leaning forward with her hands across her knees . An ' be there with ' em when she comes back from the depot with the boy ! MORAN And you could have all the things she needs piled in the middle of the front room floor and you be in there with the door shut when she got there  --  edging forward on her chair  --  clothes and groceries an ' I du n no but some toys  --  DIANTHA Be an awful job , managin ' . How 'd we let ourselves into the house ? MIS TROT Really kindling . Easiest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set with her awhile before she starts for the 7:58 . I could take her in a cup o ' jell , or somethin ' . And then I could tell her I 'd set there on the porch so 's to have a look at him when she got back . DIANTHA And then you could let us all in . That 's the ticket ! My land , look at me near settin ' on my spare room pillow sham . p. 23 MIS TROT Laying down last lamp chimney and going to the door to shake the cloth . Speaks over shoulder , shaking cloth . Well , you do that and you can count on me to be over there when you come . You wo n't have much trouble gettin ' the stuff . Giving the cloth to Inez and turning toward the door . I 've got to get back to that buffalo bug now , or it 'll be layin ' eggs in every pattern in the carpet . Inez carries lamps to their high shelf , puts away cloths . DIANTHA You come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But  --  DIANTHA You ca n't be going home , not with all there 'll be to see to . MIS TROT I just ca n't do it . That buffalo bug  --  DIANTHA You forget that buffalo bug , Mis ' Trot , an ' tell us what to have for refreshments . Strawberries ? Or a little canned fruit and loaf-cake ? MIS TROT Returning . Why , of course we 've got to feed ' em . I never thought o ' that . Canned fruit . I 'd just as soon anybody 'd set me down to oatmeal as canned fruit  --  when it 's a party . Strawberries  --  well . . . . No , for the land 's sakes , if we 're going to do it , let 's us do it . Let 's us have ice-cream or nothin ' . . . . p. 24 MORAN Be nice for the little boy , too . DIANTHA But , my land , it costs so to buy it  --  MIS TROT Buy it ? Who said anything about buying it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody in this town . DIANTHA Well , of course you can . That 's what we 'll do . You freeze it . MIS TROT Excitedly . I can make it for fourteen cents a quart and freeze it myself , puttin ' in our own cow and chickens . Yes , I 'll do it  --  buffalo bug or no buffalo bug . A gallon 'll be enough . We can all chip in  --  Stamping up on the porch comes Ezra Williams . He is still more exasperated , and he comes in without greeting and with his hat on his head . WILLIAMS Well , I been to both you folks 's houses , huntin ' you up . An ' I been down town lookin ' for the men . Which one o ' you ordered wood ? Whoever it was can send your men folks straight out here and unpile it from in front of my door , a stick at a time . DIANTHA I 've told him we did n't order no wood . MORAN Well , we did n't . We been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 25 MIS TROT We do n't burn none . We burn soft coal  --  what we have left over after we 've sprinkled the house with it thorough , an ' our clothes an ' our hands an ' our necks . WILLIAMS Stands puzzled but still warlike . Well , it 's somebody 's fool wood . It must belong somewheres in the block . Just ask your men folks when they come home this noon . I bet you one of ' em  --  DIANTHA Let 's tell him . Wait a minute , Ezra . We want  --  WILLIAMS I ca n't wait . I 've got my hands so full they sag . INEZ Oh , Mr. Williams ! I know whose wood that is . It must be Mis ' Ellsworth 's . I heard her wonderin ' this morning why it had n't come . WILLIAMS Well , of all the snide swindles ! I 've got too much to do to unpile no cord of wood for no woman , widow or worse . . . . He is at the threshold when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and following him . Ezra ! Ezra Williams . Stop goin ' on and listen hard . Carry Ellsworth 's sister 's boy is comin ' on to her to-night to support . WILLIAMS At the door . Support ? Well , I ca n't help that . I 'm doin ' some supportin ' myself  --  working my wings off at it . And when it comes to an extry job for nothin ' . . . . p. 26 DIANTHA Yes , but Carry Ellsworth ai n't you . Here 's a boy plumpin ' down on her to feed and clothe and lug up to man 's estate . WILLIAMS Well , ai n't that just like a woman ! Always gettin ' herself come down onto by a lot o ' distant relatives to support . DIANTHA Well , it is goin ' to make trouble for everybody , but we thought we 'd ought to  --  MORAN We thought it 'd be real nice to do for her friendly , at a party  --  MIS TROT And have ' em have refreshments  --  ice-cream and cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell him . And all be there when she gets back from the depot  --  all waiting , in her house , to s'prise her . Could n't you get hold of some men and see what they could get together ? Us ladies 'll see to some clothes but  --  MORAN You scrape up some money , Ezra . Or some groceries  --  canned stuff , or like that  --  MIS TROT And have ' em all sent to one place , had n't we better ? DIANTHA Have ' em all sent here . Then some of the men can come and tote ' em over when we see her go off to meet the 7:58. p. 27 WILLIAMS Who has stood shaking his head , edging away . Yah  --  pa'cel o ' women . Ai n't that just like ' em ? Do you think I ai n't got anything else to do ? Ai n't enough o ' you women to tend to the society end of this town and its relations ? No  --  do n't you expect no time out of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't a minute to spare to-day , I tell you . He is out the door with the last words . GRANDMA Who has been looking up at him with fixed attention . Well , now , would you think anybody would be that much interested in cord wood ? DIANTHA No , sir , you would n't . MORAN Well , ai n't that just awful for him not to do one thing ? MIS TROT Him with nothin ' but cord wood on his hands , mind you  --  and me with a buffalo bug ! DIANTHA As near as I can see we 've got to put this thing through ourselves . You take up-street , Mis ' Trot , and Mis ' Moran , you take down-street  --  and I 'll take the business part . Everybody 's always after them , so I think you really squirm more askin ' though you do get it so easy . Inez , you might be lookin ' up some of your old picture books for the boy , or somethin ' to amuse him . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIS ' ABEL , MIS ' MORAN All talking together as they go out , Mis ' Moran having forgotten her limp . Who 'll I get to bake the cakes ? Well , I 'd get some good cake makers , for mercy 's sakes , and there 's only about six in town . I know where I 'm going for a cake . I 'm goin ' straight for Mis ' Ezra Williams . Exeunt all three . INEZ I 'll iron off a flat piece or two first . She goes to the shed to change the iron . GRANDMA Peering out of the windows , through the plants . Dum ' em . They 've gone off to do things . And I 'm so old , so fool old . She smites her hands together . Oh , God . Ca n't you make us hurry ? Ca n't you make us hurry ? Get us to the time when we wo n't have to dry up like a pippin before we 're ready to be took off ? Our heads an ' our hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make ' em last busy , busy , right up to the time the hearse backs up to the door ! INEZ Returns , picks up a piece from the basket , looks over at her . What 's the matter , Grandma ? GRANDMA Eh , nothin ' . Only , I 'm folks . That 's all . I mean I was folks  --  me that was folks and now ai n't . Inez looks at her , puzzled , and stands rubbing the iron on a newspaper when Peter re-appears in the doorway , the sugar under his arm , and in his hand a paper . p. 29 PETER Mis ' Abel ! I forgot to ask you just what things you need for that little boy  --  Oh , you here , Inez ? I thought you was out . I thought  --  Here 's your mother 's sugar . INEZ Cooling her iron and not looking at him . I 'm sorry Mother is n't in . She 'll be back in a few minutes . Wo n't you come back then ? PETER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inez searches his face swiftly . Goes on with ironing . PETER With determination . I mean I do n't say half the things I could say . INEZ With a moment of understanding and sympathy , she leans on the board and looks at him . What about , Peter ? PETER About  --  about  --  oh , things . I think of so many things , Inez , when I 'm alone , that I 'd like to tell you . INEZ Still the same . Why do n't you tell me , Peter ? What are they about ? PETER Well , woods things , and about water rats  --  and gophers  --  and  --  and  --  birds ' nests ! p. 30 INEZ Still understanding , still patient . Well , I like these things , too , you know , Peter . Tell me some now . PETER Looking wild . Well . . . . Birds ' nests . They 's  --  they 's quite a few birds ' nests in the trees this spring . . . . INEZ Bursts into sudden uncontrollable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peter ! Not birds ' nests in the trees ! Oh . . . . Peter ! You must n't tell me things like that ! PETER Struggling desperately . Well , orioles now . Orioles . . . . I saw an oriole by Thatcher 's barn . It 's note was all wavy  --  INEZ Grave again . I know it . I 've heard ' em . I love ' em . PETER And I thought  --  what was it I thought when I heard him call . . . . INEZ What . . . Peter ? Sets down her iron and , an elbow in her hand , the other hand over her mouth , she watches him quizzically and somewhat wistfully . PETER Simply . It was something I liked to think . And I know I thought how you 'd like it too . Most folks do n't hear ' em call . Lots of folks do n't hear lots of things . But you do . And I do . Ai n't that kind of nice  --  like them things was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner of her apron , lifts it , and drops it , disconcerted . Mebbe you du n no what I mean . p. 31 INEZ Oh , Peter , Peter , Peter ! Laughs with her eyes shut . Oh , Peter ! PETER Turns away , looks up in another part of the room . I know it . I do n't know why it is I ca n't talk to you , Inez . I think of things I want to say to you , but when I 'm with you I do n't seem able to think ' em over again . There 's history , now . I was readin ' some history last night . There was so many things I wanted to tell you in it . I  --  I know you 'd of thought so , too ! INEZ Really . You think I would . Well , then , here I am . Try me ! PETER I ca n't . I did n't plan it out this way  --  and you laughing . INEZ Oh , tell me  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castles , Peter ? Was it about knights and swords and roses  --  PETER Oh , it was better things . One was about Peter the Great , you know . Him . He was a  --  my , he was just a dandy ! INEZ Now really at the end of her patience . Was that what you wished to tell me ? PETER Miserably . No . But  --  p. 32 INEZ Because if it was , I 'm not in the least interested in Peter the Great ! Not-in-the-least ! She marches across the floor to the shed door to renew her iron , and on the threshold she turns , overcome again by the sorry figure he has cut . Peter , oh , Peter . . . . Laughs with her eyes shut , and goes into the shed . Peter sits where she has left him , and drops his head in his hands . GRANDMA Suddenly wheels in her chair . Young man ! Peter lifts his head . Do you call that courtin ' ? Peter makes a helpless gesture . Because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and batch it and be done with it . You court like a stick of wood . PETER With a hopeless gesture . What 'll I do ? GRANDMA Do ? Do what most everybody in the world has to do before they can fit their skins and skulls . Quit thinkin ' about yourself . Dunce ! PETER Well , but I  --  I  --  Inez comes back with the iron . Grandma subsides . Peter rises miserably . PETER I guess I 'll have to be going . p. 33 INEZ Oh , must you ? Well , good-bye , Peter . PETER I s'pose it 's all done there is to do about the little chap  --  the one that 's coming ? INEZ Why , of course it is n't . Who did you think did it all ? PETER Do  --  do you think I could be any use to ' em ? Inez amazes him by dropping her flat-iron with a clatter on the ironing-stand and bursting into sobs . PETER Inez ! What is it ? He leaps to her , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her . For just a moment she leans to him , then springs free and speaks angrily . INEZ It 's nothing . It 's nothing , I tell you . Go ' way , Peter . Please go ' way . PETER Stands still for a moment , then flings up his head and speaks in wonder . Inez ! Inez ! Do you care because I 'm a fool ? INEZ Go ' way , Peter . Please go ' way . PETER Well , I will go  --  now . But by the great horn spoon , Inez , I 'll come back ! He rushes out . Inez runs to Grandma , sinks beside her , buries her face in her gown . p. 34 INEZ Grandma , grandma . Why ca n't he be like other folks ? Why ca n't he be like other folks ? GRANDMA With great tenderness . Hush . . . dearie . Hardly anybody ever is . Hardly anybody is . Moment 's pause . The door opens , and Mis ' Abel enters sidewise , her arms piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . DIANTHA Well , supposin ' they are too big ? Send ' em along  --  send ' em along . I 've cut over more of ' em than I ever made new ones . Closes the door behind her by pushing against it . My land , that 's been a tug . Folks has kept a-givin ' me things an ' I 've kep ' sayin ' I 'd take ' em right along . Dropping things on the floor and keeping them together . I know ' em . If folks had waited to send the stuff by somebody they 'd ' a ' took to lookin ' it over again an ' got to snippin ' off the buttons and mebbe decide they was too good to give away at all . You need n't tell me . Folks is folks . GRANDMA Patting Inez 's arms  --  Inez has risen , and stands surreptitiously drying her eyes . That 's it  --  that 's it . Folks is folks , no matter how different  --  or similar . They ca n't fool us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the garments which her mother is vaguely sorting . Oh , mother , how fine . Is n't that a pile ? How fine ! Examines the garments and after a moment goes to the shed with her flatiron . DIANTHA They 's everything here . Enough to clothe Carry Ellsworth 's nephew till he 's black in the face . Enter Mis ' Trot , breathless . MIS TROT I 've solicited the rest of the stuff for the ice cream and I 've got four cakes promised . Seeing the things on the floor . What a lot of splendid truck ! DIANTHA Well , I 'm most dead luggin ' it . She is stooping , turning over the things . MIS TROT Looking toward the door . And ai n't the air nice in the forenoon ? It seems like breathin ' somethin ' else . Comin ' along by the wood yard , somethin '  --  I du n no whether it was the smell of the cedar shingles or the way the fence looked so nice and shady  --  but  --  little laugh  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a girl since I was born one . If it had n't been for the thoughts of that buffalo bug in the house , I declare I would most of enjoyed myself . p. 36 DIANTHA In falsetto . Did you ? Why , I was just thinkin ' that out in Main Street  --  that it seemed somethin ' like quite a while ago . I thought it was the smell of the sage where somebody was fryin ' pork , but mebbe it was n't . Enter Mis ' Moran . She is walking nearly erect and is hurrying somewhat . MORAN It 's all right . I just see Carry Ellsworth goin ' into the post office , and I turned in on purpose . I told her somebody 'd come over to-night and set while she went to the station , and be there when she comes back . She seemed to like the idee . Is this stuff all here ? DIANTHA Yes , and more to come . Do n't you think we 'd best all be setting in there in the dark when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yell " Shower , " sha n't we ? Just like they do ? MIS TROT Down on the floor beside the things . Poor little soul  --  it 's him I 'm a-thinkin ' of . His mother dead and his home broke up and him dragged away from what folks he knows . Look here ! Well , of course we 're glad to have any of these things . Holds up a very ragged garment . How 's this for a contribution ? Nobody could patch that without they had a piece of cloth the size of the American flag  --  and not a button on it . I 'll bet you Mis ' Hemenway give this  --  did n't she now ? p. 37 DIANTHA Looking closely . Yes , sir , she did . If you 'd packed as many missionary barrels as I have you 'd ' a ' known it was Mis ' Hemenway 's without lookin ' . Mis ' Hemenway is a splendid cake-maker , but she is near-sighted about gifts she gives the poor . MIS TROT Goes on sorting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my Jeddie , if I 'd been took , and him trapsed off to a strange state , and all . Ai n't it real pitiful  --  well , now , would you think anybody 'd give away a thing as good as that is ? She holds up a garment , and Mis ' Moran , who has been shaking her head over the other one , takes it from her . MORAN No , I would not . Why , it looks like new from the store . They ai n't a thread broke in it . And the buttons on . Who give this , Mis ' Abel ? DIANTHA Who is piling up some things from the lot on the table . I was wondering what he 'd be like ? Nice little thing , I guess maybe  --  Carry 's so nice . . . . Looks at the garment . Oh , that 's Mis ' Fitch  --  could n't you tell ? Her that always sends a thirteen-egg angels ' food to the church suppers when a loaf o ' pound cake would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And her husband on thirty dollars a month . My good land , ai n't folks the funniest things ? They all shake heads and compress lips , and Mis ' Trot goes " T-t-t-t-t . " GRANDMA Ah  --  ai n't you got used to that about folks yet , Mis ' Trot ? I want to know  --  I want to know . It do n't hurt folks none to be funny , does it ? INEZ Who is entering from the shed . Grandma , look . Here was one of your balls of carpet rags rolled way out there . Would you think it could ? GRANDMA Peering at it . That 's the very one I been lookin ' for . I want it for the head . INEZ The head of what , Grandma ? GRANDMA Never you mind . I got my own occupations . You ai n't the only busy folks in the world , if you do act so cocky about it . I need something to do for as well as you . INEZ Who has been looking out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mis ' Ellsworth ! The women scurry around but they are too late . Mis ' Ellsworth enters . She is a slight , pretty woman in a light blue gingham gown and wide straw hat . She is much agitated , and sinks in a chair by the door . She has a letter and a little parcel in her hand . p. 39 DIANTHA With the other two women , trying to hide the piles of garments . Why , Carry Ellsworth ! You did give me a start . I 'm  --  we 've  --  we 're  --  do n't this look like carpet rags , though ? ELLSWORTH Hardly hears . Oh , ladies . I 've just got a letter  --  I 've had another letter . ' Seems my little boy ai n't comin ' at all . ALL save GRANDMA Not comin ' ? ELLSWORTH Slowly . No . A sister of his pa 's decided last minute she 'd take him in . She 's got five of her own , but she writes she dunno 's one more 'll make any difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ai n't that just the end of everything ! MORAN Well , Carry  --  you ca n't help it , but be glad the little fellow ai n't had all the way to come alone . MIS TROT An ' I ai n't a doubt in the world he 's got a better home than you could give him  --  anybody that can afford to have five children is rich enough to have six . DIANTHA And it was going to be awful hard on you to have him to do for . p. 40 ELLSWORTH I know , I know . But it 's goin ' to be awful hard for me not to have him to do for . Last night  --  when I begun to plan  --  it come over me like it never done before what I 'd missed in not bein ' left with one . I was goin ' to make him a bed on the lounge  --  I 'd got it planned what clothes I could spare for the bed , and what I could make more of . I never got meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he could eat and what little things I could fix up for him . I was plannin ' to keep chickens and to fix a sandpile in the backyard and a swing under the maple out in front  --  and I was thinkin ' about his school and who 'd be his teacher and what desk he 'd have . I just see this little cap in the post-office store and I bought it for him . Unwraps a cap from a little package . I thought the feather 'd look kind o ' cute , stickin ' up in front . And now here comes this  --  and it 's all for nothin '  --  it 's all for nothin ' . DIANTHA But , Mis ' Ellsworth , it would be hard for you . It would now ! ELLSWORTH I 'd like that kind o ' hard . MIS TROT And s'pose you 'd of took down sick ? ELLSWORTH Better body sick than heart sick . MORAN And s'pose you 'd of died , Mis ' Ellsworth ? p. 41 ELLSWORTH I 'd of lived first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never knew it  --  but I ai n't . DIANTHA Oh , but Mis ' Ellsworth . You 've got your health and your gettin ' along economical to brood over as it is . ELLSWORTH This would of kept me from broodin ' . Inez goes softly , and mutely slips her arm about Mis ' Ellsworth . DIANTHA Openly breaks down and wipes her eyes on the garment she is holding . Oh , ladies ! What 's the use ? We all know . I ai n't had but one , but I know . MIS TROT Yes . I 've got seven an ' sometimes I 'm drove most to death with ' em  --  but I know . MORAN Well , I never had none  --  but I know . GRANDMA Eh , mine 's dead  --  all dead . But I know . INEZ Oh , Mis ' Ellsworth . An ' I know , too . In a moment at the door appears Peter , his arms ludicrously full of clothes and parcels . PETER Look , Inez , look-a-here . See all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sees their mood and pauses , crestfallen . p. 42 INEZ Goes to him swiftly . Peter ! What a lot you got . Dear Peter . The door is pushed open by Ezra Williams . He has a small , closely wrapped bundle under an arm , and he is carrying a little chair . WILLIAMS Handing bundle to Mis ' Abel . There 's a few little things my wife just sent over . This here little chair  --  I made it myself for our little boy before he was hardly out o ' long dresses . I done the whole thing  --  pegged it myself , so 's he could throw it around and it would n't get broke . He  --  he never grew up enough to use it . . . it 's been settin ' around my workroom  --  kind of in the way . It ought to be doin ' somebody some good . DIANTHA That 's certainly good of you , Ezra . WILLIAMS Say , you 'd ought to see Mis ' Ellsworth 's wood , piled by her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't to home  --  Sees for the first time that Mis ' Ellsworth is there , over near Grandma . Good souls ! Have I let the cat out of the bag ? DIANTHA No , Ezra  --  no , no . I was tryin ' to tell you . He ai n't comin ' . The little boy ai n't comin ' after all . p. 43 WILLIAMS He ai n't comin ' ? ELLSWORTH Coming forward . No , Ezra . They ai n't goin ' to give him to me . Somebody else has took him . WILLIAMS Well , ai n't that a shame . Bristling . Who 's got him ? Want I should get him for you ? ELLSWORTH Shaking her head . No  --  you ca n't , Ezra . But you do n't know  --  you 'll never know how I feel about what you 've done a'ready  --  you and the ladies and Peter and Grandma . . . . Would  --  you mind if we looked at the little clothes ? WILLIAMS No  --  why , look at ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his ma says she 'd like you to have ' em . They was real good cloth in the beginnin ' . ELLSWORTH Fingering the garments , turns quickly to the women . Ai n't that what it is to have neighbours ? Ai n't it , though ? Look at the bother you 've been to . . . . An ' now I wo n't need ' em . DIANTHA Do n't you think a thing about us . We was glad to do it . I was feelin ' cross as a wolf with all I had to do when Inez come in with the news . She is taking off her hat as she speaks . And now I feel  --  I feel like folks . An ' Mis ' Moran 's leg and her back and Mis ' Trot 's buffalo bug  --  I guess they feel just the same about it . p. 44 GRANDMA And me . So do I. I was just hatin ' the sight o ' my carpet rags . But look at what I stodged up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a white head . ELLSWORTH Oh , Grandma ! GRANDMA Do n't you thank me . I liked doin ' it . It was somethin ' for somebody . It was real human to do . DIANTHA Well , we might as well pick ' em up . INEZ Turning to Peter , who stands apart . Peter , how dear of you to get all these things for him . Mis ' Abel unwraps them , and they draw about her to look , all save Peter , who is standing a little apart . Inez turns to him . PETER I did n't get ' em all for him . I got ' em part for you . INEZ Well  --  it was dear of you anyway . What  --  what 's that in your pocket , Peter ? PETER Brings shyly from his pocket a little clown on a stick . I saw it in the store . I did n't know but what he might like it . If he ai n't a-comin ' we might as well throw it away . p. 45 INEZ No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking down at it . Why , it 's nothin ' but a clown . Like me , I guess . . . . INEZ Well , I want it all the same . . . . Oh , Peter , Peter , what a dear you are when you forget yourself ! He looks at her breathlessly , then suddenly takes her in his arms . . . and as he does so , tosses the clown-on-a-stick into the little vacant chair . PETER Inez  --  Inez ! Do you mean that ? Oh , Inez , I tell you I 'm forgettin ' now . I 'll never remember any more . He kisses her . As they stand so , Mis ' Abel turns and sees them . The others follow her look . Grandma , too , and they all turn and look at each other , silent and smiling . And then Grandma rises , and comes slowly down to them  --  bent and peering and kindly , and holding by one arm the doll she has made . As she passes the little vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops the doll over the chair 's back in order to take their hands . She stands between and a little back of them , facing the audience . She looks up at them and tries to speak to each in turn , and gives it up with a little helpless gesture and a smile and a hand patting the shoulder of each . They are all gathered near the two , the little garments Ezra has brought still in the women 's hands and Mis ' Ellsworth still holding the cap with the feather . p. 46 DIANTHA Wiping her eyes swiftly . Strikes me the little chap is accountable for a whole heap he never even heard of . GRANDMA Eh  --  most folks always is .
