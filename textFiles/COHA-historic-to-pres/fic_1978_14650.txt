Table  --  a caf . Paul and Marge with coffee . Caf noises . MARGE O.K. Stevie Wonder 's blind . He 's black and he 's blind . That 's a lot of things to have going against you , right , but instead of letting it mess him up he turns into this genius level **29;3369;TOOLONG who 's very fulfilled spiritually according to his songs anyway plus he 's famous and rich and cool and he 's able to write all these incredibly happy upbeat numbers and here I am this white middle-class girl with two good eyes and a college education . That 's what I was trying to explain to my shrink . Stevie Wonder makes me deeply deeply depressed . The fact that he exists is really depressing to me . And of course he said I was being adolescent , which he always says . I mean I do n't need him to tell me I 'm adolescent . I need him to tell me it 's all right that I 'm adolescent . ( Pause ) Do you want to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL No , that 's O.K. Talk . It 's O.K. MARGE Why do n't you tell me about what happened ? PAUL There 's nothing to tell . MARGE Well , for instance , was it more of a thing where you left her , or did she leave you or what ? p. 3 PAUL I do n't want to keep boring my friends talking about it . People split up all the time . MARGE A lot of them have n't been married for six years . PAUL A lot of them have . MARGE A lot of them are n't my best friends . PAUL It 's just over , that 's all . It 's over . There 's nothing to say . MARGE You know what I think , Paul ? I think it 's temporary . You guys just belong together . ( Pause ) Look , you want me to move in with you ? PAUL Move in ? You ? MARGE Just for a few days . While you 're getting used to Carol not being there . I 'd invite you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to play GO it 's this Japanese game and you 'd probably end up having to let him teach you how to play , which might not be kind of what you want to be doing for the next few days . PAUL No it 's not what I had in mind . Thanks anyway . MARGE I 'm just trying to help . It 's really lonely at the beginning . I remember when I left this guy once . He said he was a genuine Oglala Sioux Indian and I believed him for two years . Blond hair and blue eyes the guy had . He looked like Sven the Swede . Boy , was he full of shit . And I was really naive . Anyway , I really missed him at the beginning , even though I did n't like him . You do n't look too good . p. 4 PAUL There have been times in my life when I felt better , I must admit . It 's crazy ; last night I I did n't feel like calling anyone . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home watching TV and getting a little drunk and I found I was thinking an awful lot about suicide . MARGE Well . It 's something you should think a lot about before you take it up . PAUL I 'm glad you called , Margie . And I have to start teaching again tomorrow . MARGE You want me to talk to Carol ? PAUL What 's the point ? It 's just over . MARGE I 'll talk to her . First chance I get I 'm going to talk to her . I like you guys . I hate to see this happening to you . Other people , I 'm glad . You , I 'm not glad . ( Pause ) Oh , that 's the other thing I meant to tell you about Stevie Wonder . He has this manager , I forgot what the guy 's name is , but he goes around killing people . Really . This guy I 'm working with , the video guy I told you about before Oh , I did n't tell you what he does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he takes these tapes of himself dancing to all the hit tunes all alone in his studio . That 's one of the things he does , and the other thing oh , and he does n't wear any clothes . Well , he told me his sister works at a place where there 's this guy who used to work for Stevie Wonder 's manager and he saw the guy kill someone . He actually saw it . Is n't that amazing ? Oh , and anyway , this video guy shows his tapes at parties . And all his friends dance to them , but they turn the sound off so they 're only dancing to the way the guy moves and he 's a terrible dancer . Do n't tell him I said that if you meet him . I 'll tell you next time he has a party . ( Pause ) Do n't worry , Paul . I 'll talk to her . It 'll be all right . ( Enter Waiter with small tray ) p. 5 WAITER Coffee and English ? MARGE Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , please . WAITER Did you hear something about an assassination ? MARGE What assassination ? WAITER That 's what I was wondering . I guess you did n't hear anything , huh ? A guy just said . I think that 's what he said . Maybe it was " examination . " Got ta get my ears checked . Milk , right ? PAUL Yes . ( The Waiter exits ) @x Carol alone . A street . JEAN ( Off ) : Carol ! Carol ! ( Carol looks around . Jean enters ) CAROL Jeannie hi JEAN How 's it going ?

" Horse jumps pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it in Japanese and it means I can take all your stones . You 're not thinking conceptually . You ca n't play GO if you do n't think conceptually . PAUL Bob . This looks like a good game , you know . It looks like a very interesting game , and some time I 'd really like to learn how to play it . But not now , huh ? Do you mind ? BOB No . It 's cool . You want to watch TV ? There 's the worst movie of the week on five . PAUL No . BOB Want to get drunk ? PAUL No . BOB Leaving Carol has n't made you a more interesting person to be with . PAUL I 'm sorry . I wish someone would talk about something else . BOB Look . When something like this happens , two things happen . One thing is everyone wants to help out , right , because everyone knows what it feels like to break up , and the other thing that happens is nobody knows what to do because everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiped out and probably like they 're not worth helping or even being with which makes it impossible for people who want to help to help . p. 14 PAUL Marge is working pretty late . BOB She 's working for this jerk who does videotape . I hardly ever see her . I mean , there 's nothing going on . I think he 's gay in the first place . He takes movies of himself PAUL Dancing naked , I know . BOB What a weird thing to do . I wonder if he 'll still be at it when he 's sixty . Can you just see it ? Whole family comes over to his loft for Christmas and he shows tapes of him-self as a young man dancing naked to " Voulez-Vous Coucher avec Moi Ce Soir . " What did your daddy do for a living ? Oh , he took off his clothes and danced naked in front of a camera in an empty studio . PAUL I heard he makes a lot of money in real estate . BOB Yeah . Boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PAUL What 's this all about ? You said you had something to talk to me about . BOB I did ? PAUL What 's the matter with you , Bob ? You called me up and invited me over and you said you and Marge had been talking about me and Carol splitting up and you had this very important thing to tell me is n't that exactly what happened ? p. 15 BOB We ought to wait for Marge to get home . PAUL Why ? What 's the big mystery ? BOB There 's no mystery . PAUL Then why are you acting so weird ? BOB I 'm not acting weird . PAUL You are too . You 're acting very weird . BOB No I 'm not . I am not acting weird , Paul . Your head 's in a weird place , that 's all . Everything looks weird to you . PAUL This is a dumb conversation . Let 's change the subject . BOB Very good idea . What do you want to talk about ? PAUL What I really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here tonight to talk about . BOB You 're right . This is a stupid conversation . PAUL I 'm gon na go home . It 's getting late . BOB No . Look . Just wait 'll Marge gets home , O.K. ? We wanted to talk to you together . PAUL Why ? BOB O.K. Whew . I do n't know . I guess I better tell you . Man , this feels strange . O.K. Well , it 's kind of about . It 's partly about me and Marge . And partly about . Has she told you much about what we 've been into lately ? p. 16 PAUL Marge ? BOB Yeah . PAUL No . I mean , maybe . I do n't know . I mean what do you mean ? BOB Well . We 've been sort of exploring this area that we had n't been aware of before . Well , we were aware of it . You know , marriage is it can be very kind of very insular . You know . A man and a woman together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from a lot of experience . And anyway , what me and Marge were thinking was that maybe you 'd let that happen to you . You and Carol PAUL That 's what you thought . BOB Look , man , this is n't a criticism . Believe me . Believe me I know what it can be like . Me and Marge . It happened to us . I mean , we did n't even know we 'd gotten into such a closed-in trip and then when we realized it well , we knew we had to do something about it soon or else every-thing that was good between us fffft ! ! You know ? PAUL What the hell are you talking about , Bob ? BOB Swinging . PAUL Swinging ? You mean two couples together ? Is that what you mean ? You 've been doing that ? You and Marge ? And two other people ? BOB or more p. 17 PAUL Together ? Having sex ? Together ? All of you ? BOB It surprises you . PAUL Yeah , I mean . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what you 're probably thinking , but believe me , it 's a beautiful thing . It 's brought an incredible amount of openness in our marriage and it 's helped us not to be afraid of our well , ourselves . And each other and other people . We 're each totally free to explore other people , but we 're also together , so we can enjoy each other 's explorations and it 's just amazing how you become aware of the fact that society has crippled you by defining sexuality in such a narrow and limited way . And we 're all victims , Paul . You take Persia and India and some of those ancient civilizations PAUL Horseshit , Bob , just horseshit . Horse shit . I mean , O.K. , so you and Marge are getting tired of each other and you do n't know what to do about it . What 's that got to do with me ? BOB We saved our marriage , Paul . PAUL Oh , man . Look . If you mean like you thought you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviting us over here for a little group sex , I mean , no , thank you . Is that what you had in mind ? Is that what you wanted to talk about ? p. 18 BOB I guess I 'm not explaining it right . I knew we should wait till Marge gets home . It 's really more sort of her idea . I mean , I do n't think it 's a bad idea , do n't get me wrong . I just sort of thought , I told her the timing 's wrong . Any-way . It beats sitting at home alone PAUL Anything beats sitting at home alone . BOB It 's just we ca n't figure why you guys split up . You were such a great marriage . PAUL That 's what everybody says . BOB No one expected it . PAUL Like that . ( Snaps finger ) Literally . We were joking around . We were making up after a fight , laughing and everything , and Carol said , " Well , if we 're going to fight all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a joke . I mean , we never fight . Never . We laugh , we laugh all the time . And instead of laughing , suddenly we were talking very seriously about ending it and we were crying and stuff . BOB Jesus . PAUL Yeah . Just like that . BOB It was a mood . That 's all . You 've got to get together and talk . PAUL It was more than that . It must have been . I do n't know what the hell it was . p. 19 BOB You know what I think sometimes . Things just happen and you never know why . You figure out all these reasons to explain it , but it still does n't make sense . Like a few days ago I started wondering why I was a carpenter . And I figured it out . I figured out a lot of reasons . I 'm good at it . It pays a lot . I work my own hours . My uncle was a carpenter . All these reasons , but I still wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wonder much more than I believe any of the reasons I came up with to explain why I 'm a carpenter . ( Pause ) That was clear , was n't it ? PAUL So . You guys have been swinging , huh . ( Paul laughs . Bob laughs . They both laugh hysterically ) @x Bare stage  --  video loft .

I feel really uncomfortable in front of the camera . p. 21 JAY It 's great . It 's beautiful . You two are perfect together . WAITER You want to play a game ? CAROL O.K. WAITER What do you want to play ? CAROL I do n't care . Whatever you want to play . WAITER Do you know that one where I start a story and then I stop and you take it up where I left off until you stop and then I keep on ? CAROL I do n't know . It 's O.K. We 'll play that .

That 's the beginning of the story . CAROL A frog ? WAITER Yeah . CAROL What about him ? WAITER You 're supposed to say what happened to him next . CAROL I 'm supposed to say what happened to a frog ? I do n't know . That 's not what we 're supposed to be doing , is it ? You did n't want us to come up here to tell a story about a frog , did you ? I need a cigarette . JAY You both keep thinking there 's something that I want . Please stop worrying about it . I want whatever happens . CAROL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O.K. ? I 'm sorry . I 'm standing in front of a camera with a guy called Jeff because some guy who 's a friend of Jean 's said come up and make some tapes and I do n't know what you want ? It 's not like I do this kind of thing all the time . I thought I 'd be watching to start with . WAITER I have a different story . Two trucks CAROL I do n't even know Jean all that well . I have other things to do . That 's all I 'm saying . I mean I just find you really weird . Not you , Jeff , I mean him . WAITER That 's O.K. , that 's O.K. p. 23 JAY Beautiful , keep going , keep going CAROL Look , I 'm getting upset . I do n't want this to be on film . WAITER Well . I have to get to work pretty soon . I mean , if we 're going to do a story we ought to start pretty soon . CAROL Please turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with me . ( Jay stops ) Thank you . ( An awkward pause .

This is really interesting . You got a great loft . You pay a lot of rent ? JAY I own the building . WAITER Oh . O.K. ( Waiter goes . Jay sits down facing Carol on the floor ) CAROL Do n't say anything . I just want to sit for a few minutes . Do you have a cigarette ? ( Jay smiles . Offers her one ) JAY You 're here in this loft . The loft is in a building . The building is in a city which is somewhere in the world which is somewhere in the universe and that makes you feel alone . But you 're not alone . Do you know what that is ? p. 24 CAROL No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell me what 's happening in your life . ( Carol laughs , louder and louder . Blackout ) @x Table  --  a restaurant . Paul and Jean . PAUL Well ? JEAN See , you 're supposed to sit with your legs crossed and close your eyes and try to imagine this thing kind of just resting at the base of your spine . Like a little black pea or something . I thought of a thermometer . PAUL Well ? JEAN And then a shoot grows out of the pea and up the inside of your spine and you have to be sure to not try to force it up . You think of it as something that has a life of its own . It just grows by itself when it 's ready . PAUL Well ? JEAN You 're not listening . PAUL I 'm listening . JEAN Then when it gets to your brain it grows out into this lotus-flower shape , that 's the image he uses , and this little hole opens up in the top of your head and the Kundalini goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know where exactly but somewhere , and when that happens you become sex . You are sex . You become the thing itself . Why do n't you come along once , see if you like it . You 've got ta get interested in something . PAUL I am interested in something . You know what I 'm interested in. p. 26 JEAN I do n't know , Paul . PAUL Which way is it going , more yes or more no ? Well ? JEAN I feel like you 're pushing me . PAUL That 's because I am . I 'm out of practice . And of course it does n't help a lot to know that you think of me and Carol as a kind of unit . You want to arrange a signal ? When it 's the right time for me to ask you if you 'd like to come home with me tonight , please indicate by grabbing my leg under the table . JEAN I feel like I 'd like to . It 's not that simple , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed you know that you and Carol PAUL Oh , no problem there . We 'll go to your place . JEAN No . PAUL I 'll turn the mattress over . I 'll buy a new one . Wait a minute . I just remembered . I do n't have to . I bought a new mattress just this morning . Whew , that was lucky . JEAN I 'm serious , Paul . PAUL I know . I know you are . I 'm horny . JEAN And what if you and Carol get back together , like everybody thinks you will . Then I 'll be someone who just came kind of in between for a while . That 's not what I want . p. 27 PAUL Why are you being so complicated all of a sudden ? You want another drink ? JEAN No . PAUL I mean , I thought I knew what 'd be fun , call Jeannie , she 's nice , she 's a friend , we turn each other on I 'm pretty sure , it 'll be fun , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice friendly sexy film and go back to our place afterward my place . And , you know . For the night . I do n't understand it . Do n't I turn you on ? JEAN Of course you do , Paul . You know that . PAUL Are you seeing someone else ? JEAN How come you can be so happy so soon afterwards . You were married five years . PAUL Because I 'm smiling a lot and acting cute to get you into bed ? Come on , Jeannie , you 're too old to think that means anything . Please come back to my place . JEAN I do n't think so . Not tonight . PAUL Why not tonight ? What 's wrong with tonight ? JEAN I just do n't want to . Not yet . PAUL When ? JEAN I do n't know . Soon . When I feel like I wo n't be being Carol . PAUL That was pretty low . p. 28 JEAN It was just true .

You want to go out or eat in ? If we eat in I could get a pizza or a chicken or something . Or we could just have the shrimp with some potato chips . That 'd be O.K. with me. p. 30 MARGE Well . What do you want to do ? BOB Either way 's fine with me . There 's a pretty good movie on nine . MARGE Are we a good couple ? BOB What ? MARGE Are we a good couple ? Should we stay together ? BOB I do n't understand . What did I say ? Did I say something ? MARGE Maybe we 're just not a good couple . I do n't think we 're as good a couple as Paul and Carol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be together . How do you feel about that ? BOB I feel . I feel . Um . I do n't agree . I feel that we should be together . MARGE Do you think we have a strong relationship ? BOB I do n't know . Yeah . I guess so . MARGE Do you think it 's strong enough to stand on its own ? BOB Yes . I do . Yes . Definitely . I think so . Definitely . MARGE Because I really do n't want to play around with other couples anymore . BOB That 's fine with me . Fine . Wait a minute . There was some chicken left over from last night . p. 31 MARGE Chicken ? I do n't think so . Hang on , I 'll look .

MARGE ( Off ) Just a minute , sweetie , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Marge reenters ) MARGE We did n't have chicken last night . There 's some cheddar . What were you just saying ? BOB I said I never liked swinging all that much in the first place . MARGE You did n't ? BOB No . MARGE Then why did you get us into it ? BOB Me ? Me ? I did n't get us into it . You were the one that kept saying our relationship was limited sexually and you thought it would be an important step to expand it into new areas . That 's what you said . Those are your exact words . Verbatim , almost . MARGE Come on , Bob . It was n't me that started sending away for all those cheesy magazines with pictures of fat married couples and stuff p. 32 BOB You asked me to send for them . You said you were embarrassed . MARGE I asked you ? Oh , bullshit , Bob , bullshit BOB You asked me . I 'm telling you , you asked me . MARGE I do n't believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet that bizarre couple with the leopardskin couch ? BOB This is just what Paul said . One minute everything was O.K. , the next minute fffft . MARGE Do you want a separation , Bob ? Is that what you 're saying ? BOB Is that what you want ? MARGE I asked you first . BOB No . I do not want a separation . MARGE Neither do I. BOB I think it 's ludicrous that we 're yelling at each other when we both agree that we want to stop swinging . MARGE I just want to talk . BOB Well , that 's what I want . MARGE Well then , let 's talk . BOB O.K. MARGE So . You think it would be all right for us to not have sex with other couples anymore . p. 33 BOB I do . I think it 'd be all right .
