" Contrary to popular belief , " declared a secretary of the Soviet Consulate in Manhattan last week , " there are cows in Russia . " <P> Occasion for this nave pronouncement was the news that Mrs. Marjorie Post Close Hutton Davies , apparently confident that her newly-appointed husband would remain Ambassador to Russia for at least two years , was sending 2,000 pints of frozen cream to Moscow and 25 electric refrigerators to keep it in . The Red comrade 's smartcrack betrayed gross ignorance of Mrs. Davies ' corporate connections and of the capitalistic uses of publicity . <P> Announcers of this Davies act were Walker-Gordon Laboratories Co. , Inc. , purveyors of milk , at Plainsboro , N. J. The cream , it was announced , will be preserved by the quick-freezing Birdseye process ( named for its inventor in 1925 , Clarence Birdseye ) which keeps food fresh for two years . Owner of the Birdseye process is General Foods Corp. , of which Mrs. Davies , daughter of Cereal Tycoon Charles William Post , is a director and the largest single stockholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , fruit and meat in the U. S. since 1931 , chose the Davieses ' diplomatic migration to introduce them to Europe . Problem there is transportation , since ordinary refrigerator cars do not maintain the zero temperatures at which Birdseye foods must be kept . Arrangements have been made for a special car to transport Mrs. Davies ' cream and other Birdseyetems . Meantime last week a Birdseye specialist , sent to Moscow for the purpose , was having the Embassy current stepped up high enough to power the 25 special Birdseye refrigerators . <P> How Ambassador-Designate Davies regards these preparations he confided to friends in the dining room of Washington 's Mayflower Hotel one day last week . " We are going to live in Moscow very quietly , very simply , " said he . " ' When in Rome , ' you know . . . . We 'll have just the comforts one ordinarily has in America . We are taking our own staff of servants . But , you may say , we shall have a minimum menage . " <P> That the Davieses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week prime Washington chitchat . No secret is it that that fragile Anglophile , Robert Worth Bingham , who failed to inform the State Department of the Simpson Crisis until it exploded in Commons , has impressed his superiors as something less than an ideal Ambassador to the Court of St. James . Should he retire soon as expected , what more natural than that the able husband of one of the nation 's richest women should hope to succeed to his glittering job ? Attesting their eligibility , Joe Davies &; wife have rented for the Coronation one of London 's stateliest houses , The Holme , Regent 's Park mansion of the second Mrs. Marshall Field III . <P> The potency of Mr. Davies ' political backing was indicated by the guests honoring him at a private dinner in Manhattan 's Ritz-Carlton Hotel last week . With Senator Pat Harrison as honorary chairman and Senator James F. Byrnes as toastmaster , the list included Postmaster General Farley , Presidential Secretaries McIntyre and Early , Senators Barkley , Copeland , Davis , Duffy , McAdoo , Tycoons Walter P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
