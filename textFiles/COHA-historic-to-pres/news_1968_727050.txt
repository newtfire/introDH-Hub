It is a dreary evening . Eight jumbo jetliners ? each carrying 350 passengers  --  are scheduled to land within an hour at Kennedy Airport in New York . The terminals are jammed with friends and relatives waiting to meet the planes . And then the fog rolls in . The planes are rerouted to Boston . There , 2,800 irate passengers storm the airline counters , an angry mob snatched by the thousands of waiting relatives who storm the counters in New York . This sad tale is only a nightmare for airline executives now , but it could become reality before long as airlines keep ordering bigger and bigger jetliners . Consequently , the airlines and the Federal Government are intensifying efforts to conquer fog . And there are indications that their research is having some success . The new fog-fighting techniques under development involve shooting chemicals into the fog , either from the air or from the ground . The chemicals turn the fog into a light rain , greatly improving visibility . The only problem is that the chemicals cost $4 a pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might cost $2 million a year to keep Kennedy Airport in New York defogged . But fog costs airlines $75 million annually ; it is a major cause of the 61,000 flight cancelatlons in the U.S. each year . Fog-fighters wo n't tell what the chemicals are , except to say they were developed by Dow Chemical Co. and Procter &; Gamble Co . A heated brine solution that is used with the chemicals was developed by Eugene Kooser , president and chief pilot for World Weather , a Houston weather-modification concern that is active in fog-fighting . Air and Ground Attacks World Weather has been running tests at the Sacramento , Calif. , airport under a $100,000 contract with the Air Transport Association , a group of 33 airlines . The association plans to announce results of the tests next Wednesday , but it is known that most experiments were considered successful . If the ATA calls the project an unqualified success , many airports are likely to try to set up anti-fog operations by the end of the year . Mr. Kooser of World Weather hopes to capitalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operations . The Kooser method of foiling fog involves attacking it from above . The clearing process usually takes from a half hour to an hour and a half , though sometimes planes are able to land 10 minutes after the fog seeding . In contrast , Government-financed researchers will soon launch an attack on fog from the ground at the Buffalo , N.Y. , airport . These researchers have mounted an airplane propeller on the floor of a mammoth , flat-bed truck . The propeller will be used to blow ordinary table salt 300 feet up into fog , which consists of tiny drops of water held together like a cloud . The salt attracts water , thus turning the tiny hanging droplets of water into bigger raindrops . The researchers , who work at Cornell University 's aeronautic laboratory near Buffalo , figure 200 pounds of Salt could cut a mile-long swath as wide as a runway through the murk . This method might be much cheaper than the chemical method , but its effectiveness has n't been proved yet . It works in the laboratory , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fight Abroad , Too If fog-fighters ' methods come into general use , they almost surely will face an outcry from conservationists and others concerned about chemicals being rained on people and vegetation . Cornell officials maintain , however , that the worst effects of their salting would be some scattered burned spots on leaves and grass . The amount of salt involved " is small in comparison to what the city of Buffalo throws on the street to melt snow , " says Roland J. Pilie , assistant chief of Cornell 's applied physics department . Officials of the Sacramento project say that their work might not even cause as much damage as salt . They say they cleared their plans with the California agriculture department before the recent experiments . While the U.S. concentrates on fog-seeding techniques , other nations are trying other methods . At Orly airport near Paris , a half dozen jet engines and more than 30 keroseneburning cylinders have been used to literally burn off the fog . But French authorities say the system is too expensive to use regularly . In Germany , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog , collecting the moisture inside and coughing dry air out the end . The Germans say they are encouraged by the tests , and they are planning experiments on a larger scale . The Russians also are working on a solution . They are experimenting with ultrasonic vibrations to force fog droplets together into raindrops . The biggest problem : The vibrations are said to be " terrible on the human ear .
