 | of verbal bullets propelled by deep , personal fury . It shattered the remaining form and outlines of these two beings ' protective coverings , unloosed twin torrents of silent , final , denuding communication . Their chins strained toward each other . Their eyes glowed with pain . They shouted confusedly , reckless of everything and everybody , isolated , as far as they , themselves , were concerned , on a swaying disk of steel at the centre of an equatorial waste of sea . " Light , ho ! " burst from the dark depths of the bridge where the listening Cruck stood panic-stricken at the wheel . His hoarse voice , usually cocksure with a kind of brutal presumption , was tainted with uncertainty , bewilderment , and with primitive relief at the pretext for interruption . It was perilously near a warning scream . Silenced instantly , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Warrington swung about and faced , on the lonely , livid horizon , the evidence of how thoroughly they had been swept from the course of their proper function . Taganak Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became an uncertain , golden stain beneath the drift of paling stars , was already high . A stiff breeze had sprung up . It swept a flight of spray across their peering faces . They licked the salty dampness from their lips . The watch was over . They had travelled far up the blind alley of intimate enmity and friendship ineluctable. 17 Despite the fact that the ship might find itself blocked up in the port by the Japanese cruisers , the officers anxiously looked forward to anchoring in Sandakan . All of them had become uncomfortably alive to the crew 's increasing restlessness . It hung upon the men like an ear or an arm that , through a tenacious heaviness or the shadow of a pain , becomes unnaturally an entity in a person 's awareness . The restlessness was fevered also by a vague storm of superstitious uneasiness arising out of " Unc " Blood 's dramatization of the talk between Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and the Water Moro about the cave toward which the voyage was carrying them . " A bottomless pit , "  | according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so mysterious and horrible that men shunned even the strip of coast where it lay . " Throughout the past week this oppressive restlessness of the men had broken out in a series of sudden , bloody flare-ups . Men , being halted in their work by some routine disagreement over the exact tool to be used or the method to be followed , would begin splattering each other with stinging , verbal filth in bursts of fury which they later found it hard to account for . They sprang upon each other , slugging viciously , at the slightest provocation . Cavendish had beaten Mendel , a Fireman , so severely that he was not able to leave his bunk . Wembly , the First-Class Gunner 's Mate , a small , thin , nervous man with a large Adam 's apple , had received a sudden blow on the nose , which had so crushed and flattened it that he would be disfigured for life . The blow had come with such unexpectedness that it had not been preceded within himself by an instinctive impulse to dodge , landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unguardedly forward , at the red anger spirting and twisting up over the features of Saunders , to whom he had made some seemingly innocent comment . These encounters were nasty , instantaneous , almost clandestine affairs about which everyone kept morbidly , tenaciously silent . The officers saw only the blood and the ugly wounds left in their wakes ; whereas , normally , if two men insisted on settling a difference by fighting , it became a public matter fought- out according to prize-ring rules , in a clear space ringed by the crew and refereed by the Officer of the Deck . The Executive Officer was counting heavily on an over-night liberty in Sandakan to decrease the tension . It was a torpid little place less than six degrees above the Equator , where the resident Englishmen talked in uninteresting fashion of almost nothing else but the war their relatives and friends were fighting on the other side of the world ; but there were restaurants , brothels , a moving picture theatre and a dance hall . The accuracy of the Executive Officer 's hope was borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boasted and speculated in the talk and preparations of the men . The  | way in which they counted their money , calculated the promised pay-day and got their clothes ready was eloquent . Even a civilian stranger to the ship , perhaps , would have known that Cavendish , the Quartermaster , Second-Class , and the dandy of the crew , was preparing for an important liberty ashore . He got out his fine suit of white duck , cut to a quite non-regulation smartness by a Chinese tailor in Shanghai , its hip fit skin-tight , the bell-bottoms of its trouser legs beautifully exaggerated , and laundered it with the care that a photographer devotes to the development of a cherished plate . His white hat , which had been built up carefully from a regulation start into the bit of pastry that it was , he scrubbed delicately with a nail brush that he kept specially for the purpose , after which he hung it up in the sun covered with salt to dry and bleach whiter , if that were possible . The crown of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the short upturned brim was as stiff and hard as a cylinder of creamy wood . It had achieved this quality at the hands of the same Chinese tailor , who had sewn round and round , over and over , this brim in close stitches on his machine with white thread . The hat sat on the back of Cavendish 's very blond head like a white , upward-flaring halo appropriately terminating the superb symmetry of his slim , strong body . Cavendish knew that he was taking all this trouble for mere whores , native ones at that ; for enlisted men in the Orient were allotted strictly to the company of such women : But he had in his mind his somewhat inauthentic reputation for sleeping with whores without paying , which , in the Orient especially , is a difficult reputation to maintain . When he was in the States , his preparations usually had a different end in view ; for there , with a kind of sexual arrogance , he stayed strictly away from prostitutes , associating with them only through accident , deception or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in New York , Philadelphia or Boston , he always was able to play upon the curiosity and stirring attraction the picture he created aroused in some incautious waitress or shopgirl . He would manage to persuade her into an isolated place , skilfully encouraging her mental reservation that there always were ways to handle a man , always a method , in the final mo-  | ment , to escape with nothing lost but a kiss , an embrace , a tearful struggle . Once secure with her in the isolation of some lonely room , a cluster of trees , a stretch of deserted beach , and convinced that there willingly was no surrender beyond this , Cavendish would reach up , quietly , suddenly , unexpectedly , and strike a short , gentle blow on the point of the chin . The girl would be stunned or knocked completely out . As he had wrapped his hand with his black silk neckerchief before delivering the blow , this wrapping process being carried out under the guise of a nervous gesture in the midst of distracted pleading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carefully had studied the force and delivery of this blow , practising it on a punching bag . It never had gotten him into trouble : the outraged girl with retribution in her mind , when she was willing to face the disgrace , had little or no social or legal case : she had gone into a deserted place with him , there had been no outcry , her clothes were not torn , there was no evidence of struggle . In Cruck 's case , on the other hand , the preparations were as simple and straightforward as their object . When they called away the liberty party the Chief Boatswain 's Mate just would put on some clean clothes and go ashore . He would have dropped whatever he was working at and gone ashore dressed quite as he was if he had been permitted to ; but he could not get over the gang-plank unless his shoes , clothes and hat were clean and in good order . Meanwhile , across the plexus of his anticipations poured the visionary impact of beef-steak , fried potatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted bodies . It never occurred to him to seek out any women but whores ; and he probably would have resented an implication that he associated with any other kind . By some obscure thing common to the tastes of both of them , he and Arnold , the Quartermaster , often were led to the same brothels ; and this was a particular irritation to both Cruck and Arnold , for both invariably described their evenings in detail next day , and from their respective descriptions it sounded as if they had been to quite different houses . Arnold 's conception of what the land held for him was projected with clear definition into a conversation that he and  | Warrington , the Seaman , engaged in as they stood at the windbreak of the bridge immediately after Delilah had anchored off the town . Arnold was trying to persuade Warrington to go ashore with him . His gentle , brown eyes , which always seemed to harbour a pained expression , were fastened avidly on the little Asiatic town , and his small , pugged nose , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plane with the surface of his face , sniffed at the warm off-shore breeze that swept out to taint faintly the atmosphere about the ship with a disturbing , living redolence . Arnold 's head was a bit too large for his body . Above his face this was not so noticeable , for his hair was a soft dust colour and downy in texture ; but his face was big and rectangular , and his small mouth , nose and eyes were set into it in such a manner that the somewhat brown face , seen at a distance sufficient to lose the expression of the eyes , would strike the observer at once as being that of what in the language of the prize ring is called a killer . Arnold never had been ashore here before , and his hope and his hunger led him to exaggerate Sandakan 's possibilities in terms of what he knew about Manila . Sandakan was little more than a large village ; yet as he talked persuasively to Warrington , what he really and plainly had in mind was the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore " in Manila meant simply and almost exclusively a prolonged visit to one or another of the houses in the restricted district of Caloocan . Warrington knew this because after each night ashore , Arnold would discuss , in quiet , unsparing rumination , the visit that had monopolized his hours of liberty . The manner in which he would discuss it , within whatever group he happened to find himself in a moment of relaxation , was precisely the same manner in which he would have related , if he had been a stock-broker living in the suburbs at home , the eventualities of a last-night 's dinner party . It was the retained impression of this authentic social quality , this unquestionable respectability , only incidentally and as a matter of course spotted with lust , that , habitually dominating Arnold 's attitude towards the houses of his visits , almost had persuaded Warrington in the end . " These women is different , " Arnold assured him , thinking  | of the brothels up north around Manila , " they 're small and quiet . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pester you like them bitches on the Barbary Coast . You got to buy drinks , but you do n't have to drink ' em , see . And you do n't have to take no whirl at the quiffs . Jes ' take it in as a show , see . Christ , you probably been to plenty of shows where the actresses was just as much of bitches as these girls . Come on with me and have a look . They 've got fine records for the victrola and they always have a big bouquet of flowers on the table in one house I know . " If this persuasion had come before Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Warrington had opened their conversations , the chances are that Warrington would have gone with Arnold . As it was , he nearly succumbed ; for even the prospect of being cut off from the officer 's friendship for the two days the ship was to be in port had begun to spread before his eyes again the threatening panorama from which the new relationship had beguiled him . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his sensitivity , as if his apperception had been one of those flowers that closes up tightly in gloom but uncoils under the first ray of warmth and brightness . Because of this , all his repugnance of prostitutes , all his sensitivity to the repellent vision of them that persisted in his mind and feelings , was more poignant than it had been in a long time at the very moment Arnold 's singular display of them was on the point of seducing him . Uneasy with a kind of jealousy aroused by Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's being forced to remove himself totally beyond his pale for two days or more , and sensing his former loneliness crawling in upon him again from all sides , he stood on the raw steel deck and stared with hungry eyes at the fragrant land where quiet butterflies played a victrola in a room decked with flowers . The water licked and slapped gently at the sleek grey side of the ship just beneath them . Arnold talked on . Suddenly Warrington , more to reassure himself , more to convince himself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to inform Arnold , interrupted with a blunt explanation of his feelings about prostitutes . The Quartermaster was aston-  | ished , almost as upset as if suddenly he had been confronted with a threat of maniacal violence . His expostulations took the bewildered , time-marking form of demands for clearer , more detailed explanation . To these Warrington , with a shy , fanatical look in his eyes that lent to his words an insuperable authenticity , explained that he could as soon embrace a female pig or monkey as a whore . Arnold literally did not know what to say . Nothing but a half-whispered exclamation came to his lips , an exclamation called out more by the turmoil and power flaring in the boy 's face than by his words . " Jesus Christ , man , you 're bug-house ! ... You got a crazy slant on this , " muttered Arnold . A wild necessity to clear up the shameful consternation swirling about this dumbfounded friend drove Warrington deeper and deeper into self-exposure . For this crude man , in whose walking , talking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he opened up his insides in a desperate manner that had not been approached even in his conversations with Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . From behind the very altar of his being he abstracted the ineffable purity and beauty of his beloved . Confused , distraught , his finely chiselled face bent forward solicitously , his large grey eyes flaming with exaltation and a plea for understanding , his thick , shapely eyebrows arched high in a sort of uncertain innocence , he described the girl in detail , quite unaware that it was beside the point . He used her as an example , offering her as a clear foundation upon which to erect his proposition that a normal woman could not be seduced , that she could be taken , and then only despite her sacrificed spiritual and physical reluctance , within marriage or its equivalent . He added to this the statement that the man who so took her was the only one to whom it was possible , through some definite , material hindrance , for her ever to give herself . When it was out there before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sound right . This only increased the boy 's effort , drove him floundering , here and there , frantically . He told Arnold , as one might rush to fling bits of debris into a hole iii a dam , told it in a clear , passionate voice , that this girl could not swear , could not speak obscenities , that something in  | her mental and spiritual being , something physical in her vocal chords even , surely made it impossible . Arnold , his eyes fastened on the boy 's face , his own features and body obviously tortured by a spasm of embarrassment and revulsion , backed away by unconscious degrees until he bumped against the base of the gun a few feet away . His feet hit the spread of the conical base first , so that he fell awkwardly back against the gun . He leant there for a moment . His averted , flickering gaze landed on the bridge ladder . He turned and threw himself towards it . " I got ta get ready , " he faltered . As Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecastle door , his mind and feelings struggling stickily in the confession he just had received , he went unseeingly past Feenan , the red-headed Oiler , whose initial dislike of Warrington had only been aggravated by his spectacular endurance in the fire-room on the trip to Isla-Sulu . In the midst of that occasion Feenan had gone on record , publicly and contemptuously , with the prediction that the boy never would stick it out below . The Oiler , having just come off watch in the Starboard Engine-room , and having paused on his way into the forecastle to look at the town , had heard all of the disclosure Warrington had made to Arnold . He had been almost under their feet , hardly three yards away . His large pale , freckled face was alight with a leering grin as he looked after Arnold , the kind of grin people direct at the back of a man who has been made the victim of a piece of ridiculous , obscene madness . 18 Nearly all that were going ashore had gone , with the exception of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as a result of having stood the watch that brought her in . One of these exceptions was Feenan . He stood with large legs aspread over his bucket , the soap and water dripping about on his naked , bulky , thirty-four-year-old body and over the rotundity of his developing waistline . Large and husky as he was , his body skin was of an almost unhealthy paleness . Only at the back of his  | short , thick neck was there any colour . There , below the line of red hair , the skin was roughened by a series of cracklike wrinkles and was coloured with a freckled grey-ruddiness . He scrubbed himself with complacence , as he did everything else in this society in which his position was excellent , of which he was , as a matter of fact , a self-respecting and respected pillar . His mature age and the fact that he had definitely committed himself to the Navy , in which he already had spent nine years , caused him to view his surroundings with much more resignation than prevailed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only for the day when they would be handed discharge papers . This , combined with his naturally domestic nature , led him to endow his life and equipment with all the flavours of permanence that were possible to him . His locker in the forecastle had been waterproofed and neatly lined with felt . He bought numbers of handy implements , such as a sheathed mirror , adapted especially for the kind of life that had to be lived aboard ship ; and he often brought back from ashore a glass of preserves , a box of shredded wheat or a carton of Life Buoy Soap with which to garnish the routine of his life . The handle of his bucket was attractively braided round with white cord , which he kept scrubbed decently clean . He read the Saturday Evening Post and the sports pages of the old newspapers that reached him regularly about once a month , read them slowly and carefully while he puffed importantly at a five-cent cigar , a box of which he kept in his locker . He had very little to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense by those who appreciated his leaving the saying field quite to themselves and by those who , unable to say anything either , valued the comfort of his unchallenging presence . When he did speak , the tough pomposity of his voice , the solemnity with which he spat as a mark of punctuation or . puffed his lips before he began , begot for his shortest inanity the praise that , " When Feenan speaks he 's got something to say . Now he smirked at the other three men who were washing with him , a smile that seemed to say , " Watch this if you want to sec some fun , " as Warrington , who had finally decided to go  | ashore , walk around and eat dinner , came out of the forecastle door with a change of clothes in his hand . Feenan waited while Warrington heated his bucket of fresh water under the noisy steam jet , then , he shot at the boy , in a falsely jovial , vulgarly pedantic voice , a question that summed up what Warrington had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so obscenely , that the question seemed to bear almost no relation to it . however , the question disclosed to Warrington how thoroughly his explanation had been overheard . Stunned with mortification , he hung above the bucket he just had laid on the deck . He could think of nothing to say . The only things he was trying to think of to say were things that would pacify or choke this man into silence . He turned his body so that his face would be shielded from the four men and pulled off his undershirt . IIe kept silent . " Listen , the Oiler went on , " the sooner you learn this the better . Any woman , I do n't give a damn who she is , married or single , will lay on her back when the right man comes along . " The boy kept silent . " Not only that , she 'll do it a dozen times a month if a dozen different right men come along . . . And give her a couple of shots of hootch and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're all the same . The whores is just the unlucky ones , the ones that got caught too often . " Warrington was praying , praying mechanically , tensely , for the continuance of the bloody deafness that his surging , pounding mortification had whirled about his cars . His little eyes fastened on the boy 's back , Feenan paused in his dressing and waited for a response . His one hundred and seventy-five pounds of body were balanced on one leg and a shoulder resting against the screen of the starboard blower . He was in the act of pulling on his trousers . One thick leg already was encased ; the other was jack-knifed above the trousers , ready to be lowered . He began to feel humiliated . The fun somehow was not developing . The three spectators waited , solemn , puzzled . Under the boy 's silence and unresponsiveness , the visible accoutrements of the man 's prestige began to crumble and tarnish . Feenan 's face became redder and a trifle puffed . The situation hung like this amongst them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected by a powerful magic lantern against the dark side of a building above a crowded street . Feenan finished dressing , and stooped to gather his gear . The flesh of his hips and legs strained and bulged at the clean , white surfaces of his trousers . As he stooped , his face grew still more crimson until it vied unpleasantly with his damp , crinkly hair , which was brushed as straight back as it would stay . He stowed his soap , towel , comb and brush in his empty bucket . All at once he straightened up and stepped ' towards Warrington . He grabbed him by the shoulder and shoved him back against the forecastle bulkhead . " You swell-headed little punk ! Say something when a man talks to you . . . You God damn white mouse anyway ! " A " white mouse " was a man who informed on the crew to the officers . The three onlookers knew Warrington was not that . So did Feenan ; for Warrington 's conversations with Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had been reported to all hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody 's mind as to their subject . It was in the very fact of their talk not having been about the ship or even about the Navy that the scandal had lain . " Aw , lay off the kid , " said one of the men . Warrington shook off Feenan 's gesture , which had been half-way between a shove and a blow . " Well , what do you want me to say ? " Warrington asked . Feenan screamed his answer in a shrill , thin , nasal torrent of sound into which the whole lusty bulk of his being seemed to be goaded . " You understand what I 'm telling you ! Any woman will lay on her back the first good chance she gets ! I do n't give a damn who she is ! Do you get that ? They 're just as hot after it as men are . Do you get that ? " " No , " said Warrington , with a kind of incandescent deliberation , " that is not true . " " You crummy little son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you ? " The man 's big fists obviously were trembling on the verge of a series of blows . To Warrington , the beating looming close before him was  | a terrible thing . A heavy , spirit-attacking fear always would sicken him at the mere hypothetical prospect of a broken nose , a battered eye or a bleeding mouth . For him a fist fight over some trivial cause , more for the joy of battle than anything else , such as school grounds witness every day , was a thing of sterile brutality . In the extreme case , he stood ready , he believed , to die for certain significances of his being ; but he prayed if such an occasion should come , its exaction would be death and not wounds . Here once again before him , however , were blood and wounds , petty , horrible , meaningless wounds . Already he could feel once more the flashing smash upon his eyes .. . taste the destroying warmth of his own blood . . . Ile could escape . . . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not calling you a liar . You 're probably right . " The whole business was without real meaning anyhow . He stepped ( and with the two short steps all the thing within him that was not mere bone , liquid and flesh dropped one notch nearer to the extinction that had progressed with each of these catastrophes ) to a clear space of deck . He said , the thin , glowing air of his breath making the speech difficult , as if he were drawing it on the indescribable heights where the figure of a young girl glistened as a symbol of glamorous purity : " All right then . . . you 're a liar . " 19 Two of the men picked Warrington up and carried him into the deserted forecastle to his bunk . Even after the Seaman had been knocked to the deck unconscious , Feenan had attempted to hold him up with one hand while he pounded at him with the other ; but the men had shoved Feenan aside . " He 's not hurt , " said one of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neck and limbs , " just out like a light . " " Too bad Doc 's already gone ashore , " said another of the three , referring to the Pharmacist 's Mate , Heller . " I 'll watch him , " said a voice from the gloom at a level with their heads . It was Mendel , the Jew . His bunk , where  | he lay , silent and inscrutable , recuperating from the beating he had received at the hands of Cavendish , was in the centre tier , directly opposite Warrington . He had been able to hear most of the words and blows that had comprised the fight . Mendel made no further sign in recognition of the boy 's plight until the two men had retreated through the forecastle door to the deck outside , where Feenan was talking loudly and heatedly in justification of what he had done . The Oiler seemed bent on eliciting some approving word , some word consonant with the attitude the crew always had held toward him . When they were quite alone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoisted himself painfully out onto his feet , and looked into the boy 's bunk , observed the items of damage , gazed at the crushed excellence in which he had taken so much private and distant pleasure . The way the boy , without fear though without physical strength , had become a free member of the formidable O'Connel clique , his locker full of intellectual furniture , the precision and skill of his talk , the almost fanatical nobility of his gaze , and his obvious rejection of the life about him , had made the boy seem a fine thing to Mendel . On the night when he heard the report of how Warrington , the lowest man in the ship , had in some miraculous manner dared to stand eye to eye with the Executive Officer and establish his intellectual equality if not superiority , a rush of exultation had swept through Mendel . In sheer theory , the world had seemed for him , at that moment , a more tolerable place . He would have liked nothing better than to have struck up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate even slightly in his life ; but he had not dared . To talk to Warrington , even to listen to him , except at a distance , Mendel would have had to risk getting within range of O'Connel , the Water-Tender , and it was this that he had not dared ; for much of the Jew 's waking life was spent keeping beyond the notice of O'Connel , whose custom it was to set upon him verbally and physically on the slightest pretext or none at all .  | The unreasonable antipathy that Mendel inspired in the Irishman seemed to take objective form on every occasion that O'Connel was reminded of him . If someone no more than mentioned the Fireman , O'Connel was likely to interrupt with the exclamation , " That dirty Kike ! " and look around in an aggressive manner to see if Mendel was in sight . Once O'Connel and Mendel had met in a narrow passageway . The Jew had flattened himself nervously against the bulkhead to let his enemy by . O'Connel had looked at him with disgust for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook to the stomach with his fist . For this reason , for this scourge of his life , Mendel had been forced to participate indirectly , at a secure distance , in the kind of splendour with which he had endowed Warrington . He would sit out of sight around the angle of the bunk tiers or in the obliteration of a deep shadow and listen to Warrington and Arnold argue . Periodically , as he listened , he would nod his head approvingly , savouringly , a faint flick of oriental smile at the corner of his large mouth . But now here it was , all his splendour and fineness , lying wrecked and blood-smeared on this blanket . He got a clean undershirt from his locker , moistened it from a bottle of antiseptic he had been using on his own wounds , and dabbed the boy 's face and neck clean of the blood . After this he crawled back into his place again and lay on his back with his eyes closed , his sharp , beaked face quite expressionless . Warrington was crying stertorously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of Mendel 's sympathy and assistance . Outside on the deck , Feenan still was arguing with one of the men . The other two had gone . The Oiler seemed to have been driven frantic by the heat , the white glare and some incomprehensible frustration inherent in his crisis . " What do you want to do ? " expostulated the Seaman , " kill the poor kid ? " " He ai n't said he 's had enough , " droned Feenan shrilly , " he 's not going to get away with calling me a liar . " He exploded in a fusillade of obscenity . Stamping about the deck in front of  | the forecastle door , he kept swinging his right fist in a tentative , hungry manner , as if its unwonted taste of blood and feel of tearing flesh only had aroused in it a desire for more . When , in the end , Feenan shoved past him and stepped into the forecastle door , the Seaman looked helplessly down the vista of the deserted ship . His concern had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of running aft for the Officer of the Deck , a dangerous , uncannonical expedient , one which was likely to bring down on him the contempt of the crew . He succumbed to this temptation only under the pressure of the Oiler 's persistent and bewildering savagery ; but he was halted , even as he turned to run aft , by a frightful , hysterical yell from the depths of the forecastle . It had halted Feenan too , stopped him in the doorway , where he hung bent for the low opening , swaying uncertainly . The wild threat came from Mendel , who now was standing beside the boy 's bunk , his thin , half-naked , somewhat absurd figure leaning stiffly forward in a fierce gesture . The dark liquid of his eyes had turned to glaring metal . They were insanely threatening in his unshaven face , like the eyes of a large rat cornered in the murk of the forecastle . Dirty , bruised , he was a grotesque monument to the projected pain under his left hand that pressed at his own broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this contingency with his personal suffering , that seems to burn and sing through the typical Jew whenever he is forced to witness physical oppression . In his right hand he grasped a short , jagged length of broken crow-bar , which since his beating he had kept hidden under the mattress of his bunk . Feenan was staring at the hand that held the unexpected weapon . In the twilight of the forecastle , clenching the bar so ferociously that the blood and skin seemed to have disappeared from the bones , the skeletonlike hand , pale , indistinct , hideous , was like a certain portent of death . The Jew had yelled at the figure in the doorway : " If you come in here , you son of a bitch , I 'll kill you ! "  | 20 The crew returned to Delilah next morning in a kind of relaxation that dimmed momentarily the contracting rings of torturing necessity and bad luck which they would begin to feel again as soon as the anchor was hoisted . Those who habitually smiled , smiled easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The news of the trouble between Warrington and Feenan appeared to them , therefore , not as being one of the outbursts that had punctuated the days before the ship reached Sandakan ; but rather much as it would have struck them under normal conditions , as a somewhat unpleasant and quite unnecessary public occurrence . O'Connel backed Feenan against the guard rail in his engine-room and , glaring down into his face , rasped threateningly : " Listen , fumble-foot , lay off the kid ! Get me ? " To emphasize this , he delivered one of his characteristic short jabs to the red-headed man 's stomach . The Oiler , his face puffing with fear , indignation and pain , sank to the floor plates , hugging his stomach with both arms . But Arnold was not satisfied so easily . As he listened to the Seaman who had witnessed the whole thing , his large face lost more and more the saving gentleness of his soft eyes . The lids by imperceptible degrees almost met to obscure them in a minatory squint . All day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the situation that his being found indigestible . It was not that the Texan had been given a beating ; even his partisanship of the boy did not exempt him from Arnold 's unformulated dogma that a strong man had a right to beat a weak one if the weak one got in his , way : But there was something , in this particular situation , that the formula did not cover , something that kept flaming up to demand defence , redress . Towards supper time his brooding developed into his saying to himself : " He 's always hated the kid . . . hated him because he could talk out of books . . . said once they ought to take the books and throw ' em  | overboard . . . the red louse ! . . . And that time the kid talked it out with the Exec he 'd almost went crazy . " It probably was this feeling , this wrench at one of the most powerful and absurd superstitions of his make-up , a sensing that Feenan somehow had done violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying to Arnold for some kind of action . He leant over and rolled up the bottoms of his dungarees and tied his shoe-laces tight and secure . Straightening up he shifted his weight from one leg to the other , testing his feet . Then he went aft to the galley and got a cup which he filled with water at the scuttlebut . Carrying this in a careful way , as if he had some business with it forward in the forecastle , he padded slowly past the group in which Feenan was listening to someone recounting adventures ashore . Abreast of Feenan , he put out his elbow so that it bumped against the Oiler , spilling some of the water . " Gangway , you punk ! " Arnold shouted angrily . Everybody turned inquiringly to face the two men , arranging themselves automatically in a semicircle of spectators . Arnold was the smaller and weaker of the two , but the men could see that it was he who was bent on aggression . " What are you getting tough about ? " said the Oiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if you want to find out come on up on the forecastle and I 'll show you . " " All right , you God damn trouble maker , " answered Feenan , throwing his cigar over the side with a vicious jerk of his big hand , " you 're asking for it and you 're going to get it . " " Fight ! " someone shouted . The cry echoed up and down the ship as the two men walked deliberately towards the forecastle ladder with the growing crowd behind them . Ensign Snell , the Officer of the Deck , heard the cry and got up from his chair on the quarter-deck . Iie stared forward a moment at the throng moving up the forecastle ladder , then he , too , walked forward . The pair already were thickly ringed and striking blows by the time he had pushed through the crowd that formed the ring on the narrow , tapering forecastle deck . When they clinched , he separated them .  | Arnold was relieved when he saw the white , starched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy in the clinches , but given regulation , open fighting he was sure he could do the job he had in mind . Respected as Feenan was , the crowd was with Arnold . They roared encouragement to the smaller man carrying the fight so silently and aggressively to the Oiler , whose big arms were swinging and slugging dangerously . Finding and utilizing his chances with machinelike precision , Arnold was using all his memory , skill and ring experience to cut the Oiler 's face to ribbons . He accepted no opportunity for a blow , except for tactical reasons , that was not to the face . He deliberately passed up two sure chances to deliver knockout hooks to the jaw , because Feenan 's face was not yet cut up enough to suit him . Fighting this way , he was afraid he would be knocked out himself or that on account of the blood Ensign Snell would stop the fight before he had done what he wanted to do . So far , Arnold had boxed himself clear of every really serious blow ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually one of those powerful haymakers was going to catch him . He lashed both of Feenan 's eyes closed . lle opened up a gash just forward of the left ear with a twisting hook that almost broke his wrist . He mangled Feenan 's mouth into a puffy crater that sprayed red as the big man panted and swore . Ensign Snell was worried . He could not quite understand this fight . He was surprised that apparently Arnold had not punch enough to knock the man out . Feenan was not even winded . He did not feel like stopping this thing , with Feenan still so fresh , until the big fellow had done a little damage himself . If he only could land one of those swings . . . he did n't like the bird , but it was n't justice not to give him his chance after the mangling he 'd taken . . . yet this was getting altogether too bloody . The men were yelling : " Put him out , Freddie , put him out ! " " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " Suddenly Feenan could not see at all . He could not manage to wipe enough blood out of his closing eyes . Every time he  | used his hands for anything but fighting , his enemy seemed to twist another burning knife in his face . He slipped in his blood and fell in a sitting posture to the deck . The blows on his face ceased . He remained sitting there with his back to the railing , from which the crowd had cleared as the fighters manoeuvred against it . The sun had set and the sky was drenched in deep , smooth red , against the background of which the man 's hair and uplifted , blood-covered face formed one of those ugly contrasts that arise out of conjoined tones of red . " Get up , you ignorant bastard , " said Arnold in a voice as vicious and machinelike as his blows had been . The way he said the word , " ignorant , " seemed clearly to indicate that in that word lay the clue to the real cause of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delilah steamed out of Sandakan . Long , slim , compact , with port-holes agleam , she speared into the torrential slant of rain like an anomalous animal of the rain and night , reckless of her fate , swaggering out over the black sea into obscurity . The rain continued all night , and its interminable , leaden lines filled the desolate newness of the daybreak , grey , vast and lonely . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Warrington , standing well in from the bridge rail in an effort to escape some of the rain that slid in between the awning and the top of the windbreaker , silently and dejectedly watched the blackness of the night turn to emptiness . For no particular reason at all it had turned out that since an hour before , at four o'clock , when they had come on watch , they had spoken no word save sparse syllables connected with the blind navigation of the ship . Finally in what might have been an effort to save himself from succumbing to the pale desolation , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said : " There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The drum and purr of the rain on the awning had blurred his voice .  | " I 'm sorry , Sir , but I did n't catch what you said , " the Seaman answered , turning toward him . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick swung about a trifle irritably to face the boy and repeat his comment . " I said . . . " His words smothered to a stop on his lips . The shade of irritation on his face gave way to shocked pity and distress as he gazed in the dead light at the boy 's battered features . Unconsciously , in a quick unobtrusive movement , his hand went out as if reaching to make a gentle , impulsive gesture of pity and support . As unconsciously , Warrington 's hand rose in response . Suddenly feeling drops of rain on the backs of their hands , they stared at them there , suspended gropingly , nearly meeting , half-way between their bodies . Startled , they drew them hastily back . 22 The series of incidents growing out of the beating he had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure and easy shelters of silence and untestable assumption , he had entered the sphere of action , where , in quick succession , he had gained a pitifully easy and thoroughly unpopular victory , been forced to back down before the Jew , taken an ignominious admonishment from O'Connel and in a fair fight with the much smaller Arnold been given a spectacular cutting up in the midst of which he had quit , in the feelings of the crew , like a craven . Men who usually protected themselves from brawls by an unfailing show of good humour in the little incidents that so readily lead to them , now took no pains with Feenan . They gave the appearance of simply brushing him aside with the mental comment that it really did not matter whether he liked it or not . He seemed to be , for these men , no longer a person to be reckoned with . Hardwood , whose hooting , loud-mouthed , negroid ragging spouted and spread through every moment of work and leisure that found no officer present , respecting no target from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as Hardwood 's ragging  | was concerned , the Oiler just might not have been a member of the crew . This was the most salient outward sign of the change in Feenan 's social position ; and it was the most important one , for an informed person , studying the relative positions of the members of the crew on the basis of Hardwood 's jibes alone , could form a very accurate opinion as to the social standing of each man . On Feenan 's face settled a permanent , irritating look of bewilderment and self-pity . It was as if he went around the ship with a sign on his breast like a beggar reading , " I am now an underdog . " On the other hand , Mendel 's fate suffered quite as great a change in the opposite direction . The whole crew believed he certainly would have tried to kill the Oiler ; Warrington became his close friend ; he was seen on afternoons after five o'clock reading one of the boy 's books ; and now Warrington persistently stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , when Rene and O'Connel were trying to organize a pinocle game around the Blacksmith 's lowered cot on the port side in the shelter of the Amidships Torpedo-tube , and having difficulty in finding a fourth , O'Connel had invited Mendel to play . Mendel , Feenan and Saunders had been scrubbing clothes in the wash space . When the Irishman 's prowling for a player had brought him there , he had surveyed the three for a moment , his big face chopped by a meaningless grin . Saunders did not know how to play . It was a choice between Feenan and Mendel . Then he had roared belligerently , annoyance and surrender plainly dominating his voice : " Come on , Kike , sit in . " Mendel had gotten up at once , dried his hands and sat down at his place in the game , an inscrutable look on his narrow , beaked face . From that occasion on , he suffered a continual hooting bombardment from Hardwood that must have been very difficult to bear . In some manner the Seaman had discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bank in Brooklyn . It was easy for the crew to understand an allottment to a woman , a wife or some member of a family ; but to allot one 's wherewithal to get food , drink and women to a bank was in most of their eyes a kind of mean absurdity .  | Merely to mention the fact was , for them , a joke : and Hardwood managed to bring it out in some connection or none at all at all hours of the day or night . Once Mendel , crawling up out of the fire-room hatch at two o'clock in the morning , had dropped a clinker out of his clothes onto the deck as he straightened up . Hardwood , passing forward to go on wheel watch , had heard the slight ring as the piece of slate hit the deck . He had half hissed in the chortling voice of a Negro on a secret spree : " Hey ! . . . Kike . . . There goes your dough ! . . . What 's happened to that bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for others when aimed at them were like linked drops of water eternally pounding away at the head of a torture victim ) as if they had been nuggets of gold and he the miser that Hardwood ever strove to make him out . They were his symbols that he had been pulled within the pale , that the most heavy pressure of his present existence had been lifted . They prepared a table before him in the presence of his enemies , they anointed his head with oil , they filled his cup to running over . 23 For the crew as a whole , however , there was no lasting peace or exultation . The moment they were under way again , the pounding threat of breakdown expanded once more at the backs of their minds ; and the ever strengthening suspicion that there was some deadly secret thing hidden behind their officers ' faces received further support from the manner in which the ship lay at anchor in Coral Bay all the next day after leaving Borneo . It was clear to everybody that this was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by the standing order given to those on watch : " Call the Captain immediately at the first sight of smoke on the horizon . " The little more that was needed to definitely and heavily mark the end of the brief relaxation in Sandakan , to throw it far back into the poignant nothingness of pleasant memory , was the putting ashore of one of those chastising Landing Parties to  | search the wild reaches from Bancal Bay to Madrepora Point . Once Delilah had rounded Cape Buliluyan and progressed but a few hours up the west coast , the whole life and being in the ship sank beneath an oppressive , specious space . The surface of the crew 's consciousness became used to the threatening pound of the shaft much as people come to accept the roar of a great city as an unnoticed part of their environment ; while the fear , confinement and drudging ordeals of the forays ashore assumed the proportions of a terrible normality . The ship seemed to drift through a monotony of strange air , utterly clear , palpable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brilliant sun that it was difficult to tell exactly where it was beneath the ship or where it extended to in the direction of the merging horizon or where it met the hard unreality of the towering land . Existence became so dreamlike that their vigilance relaxed . Their acute sense of time and space was benumbed . There were here no ships , no blurs of smoke against the intense nothingness beyond the horizon , no villages on the shore , no floating debris except when a sudden torrent of rain and wind swept out a branch of leaves or a cluster of blossoms , no lights at night to challenge the still nightmare of the white-fire flecked infinity above . All life , all existence save items in illusion seemed to have ceased . The peace grew over their festering tension and their ill-being like a marvelously smooth scab . One morning , as if the arrival bore no relation to their conscious efforts , they found themselves off Saint Paul Bay , a broad , unsheltered bite out of the stark coast-line backed by towering cliffs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran riot , and by a great blue mountain over five thousand feet high whose summit was blurred with bright , white clouds . " Hmm ... " The Captain , through his binoculars , was studying the line of sandy beach that stretched on both sides of the place where the cave was marked on the chart . Foaming white and rich with a splendid swirling wash far up the yellow beach , the surf looked enticing and lightly beautiful ; but the Captain judged  | that the combers were pounding in there at terrific speed from ten to twenty feet high . It appeared as if the great sea , calm and polished as the early morning disk of sun , suddenly aroused by sensing the still and reticent limbs of the exotic land so near it , was predaciously flinging itself forward in all its tremendous force . " I 'm afraid you 're going to have to land your boats through the surf there , Mr. Fitzpatrick , " said the Captain . " It 's going to be a nice little job , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also was examining the land through binoculars . Still studying the strip of beach , the Captain said : " I ca n't find hide or hair of that river . . . ought to be issuing somewhere along there . " Then he added quite irrelevantly , removing his eyes from the binoculars for a moment to take a general look around at the supernaturally peaceful and artificial-seeming world , " If it comes on a blow while you 're in there , I 'll have to take her around into Ulugan Bay . There 's no shelter here . If the blow should keep up , we 'll try to push some stores overland to you across Piedras Point . It looks pretty tough , though , through there . I f we could n't get through , you 'd just have to make out . " " O , do n't worry about the Landing Party , Captain , we 'll make out all right , " said Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . IIe glanced off over the dead incandescence of the China Sea . " This calm will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet there are plenty of bananas and coco-nuts and orchids and God knows what else in there . . . not to mention those obscene oysters of Bidot 's . " " Well , you ca n't eat orchids , " said the Captain . " O , hell , Deacon ! " protested Lieutenant Fitzpatrick with a wry twist of a smile . The two boats selected for running the surf were beautiful objects of art whose sculptured forms perfectly and glamorously followed their intended function . They were whaleboats evolved by those unparalleled seamen who hunted the whale out of New Bedford , boats which are the same today as when the Navy first inherited them , except that the freeboard is higher ,  | the thwarts are higher and more roomy , and opportunity for coxswain and oarsmen to exert their strength is improved . Very light , smooth-bottomed , a tendency toward broad beam , single-banked , six-oared , both ends a sharp cutting bow , the whaleboat inspires confidence and even enthusiasm in the men who have to handle it in a race , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their very lives are at stake . To give the two whaleboats their best chance in the effort at hand , they should have been stripped of all load except the coxswain , the six oarsmen and their oars ; but this could not be . The boats each had to carry a cargo of Landing Party with weapons and ammunition in addition to their crews . With the men working in brusque , over-emphasized movements as if trying to shake themselves free of the dreamlethargy that still seemed to bemuse them , the boats were dropped in the water alongside , after Delilah had anchored a mile and a half offshore . Rifles , ammunition belts , bunker lamps well filled with paraffin , food and a few pounds of other equipment were lashed in the bottom of each boat amidships . Bidot , the Quartermaster , First-Class , and Cruck , the Chief Boatswain 's Mate , each of whom had coxswained boats through surf before , personally distributed and lashed these loads in the respective boats in which they were to handle the steering oars . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unshipped and replaced by long , heavy steering oars , oars which the old whalemen invariably used and which give the coxswain a more powerful and delicate control over his boat , but which are inconvenient and unnecessary in the routine business of paddling about a roadstead . Barefooted , the six oarsmen took their places on the thwarts of each boat ; the coxswain standing in the stern . Their shoes , into which their socks had been tucked , were hung around their necks by joined laces . At the command , " Toss Oars ! " they swung their oars up vertically and held them there , while seven members of the Landing Party crawled into the bottom of each boat between the thwarts . Pushed away from Delilah 's side by the coxswains in the sterns with boat-hooks and by the bow oarsmen with their oars , the two whaleboats became  | separate units , independent of the ship and of each other , ready for the strenuous venture . Cruck roared his orders ; Bidot sang his . " Let Fall ! " The oars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Give Way Together ! " The boats slid swiftly in towards the beginning of the surf , Cruck 's boat leading because it contained Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . Just outside the well-defined line where the great , smooth calm of water mysteriously aroused itself and began to charge violently toward the land , the two boats paused . The men rested on their oars while Cruck and Bidot studied the problem before them . Suddenly the standing Cruck braced himself and felt for a good grip , with his hands , right elbow and hip , on the great steering oar trailing out astern . The six oarsmen facing him , as they saw this , felt for holds with their bare feet , curling their toes down as if to grip , while their hands flexed preparatorily on oar handles . At the stroke oar of this boat was old Blood , who had had every venereal disease known to medical science ; behind him was Hardwood , silent for once , his heavy shoulders poised and ready over his oar ; behind him his friend , Horner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fled into the Navy from his driver 's seat on a Cincinnati brick wagon after impregnating an idiot girl ; then came the strawhaired , pimply-faced Wright , the Seaman who had started running for the Officer of the Deck when Feenan was bent on renewing the fight with Warrington ; back of him Ragatzo , medium-sized , smooth , ugly , coffee-coloured , who was a fugitive from some kind of trouble with the Hudson Dusters gang in New York ; and at the bow oar , Forsythe , out of a small cattle town near Fort Worth , whose long , lean , tough being had felt , one afternoon , the intolerability of the great prairie spaces surrounding him , and had tried to escape through a bright Navy lithograph pasted up in the post-office . The passengers crouching in the bottom of the boat had complete confidence in these men . They were the best boat 's crew in the ship . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , pleasantly scented , elegant in gold and white , sitting on his heels at Cruck 's bare , clutching feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smilingly at the land as if there were no crisis at hand . " Give Way Together ! " yelled Cruck , digging his steering oar deep into the sea . Their bodies stretching , their heads bowed , the searching illumination of the slanting sunlight turning the hair of their bare heads and Blood 's beard into tangles of dark , distinct lines , they pulled smartly forward to battle the great walls of blue water rushing landward . They stroked swiftly and steadily in with the surging water until Cruck , in a periodic turn of the head , saw roaring down upon them the first and greatest of the pursuing waves . Looking terrible in its great height and velocity it blotted out the seascape . . . and overtook them . " Oars ! " shrieked Cruck . The oars came out of the sea , paused for a few seconds just above it , dripping blades parallel to the water and in line , waiting for the swiftly following command . " Stern All ! " The blades of the oars turned , dipped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat stood still for an instant before it reversed its direction . Cruck , his feelings exaggerating this perilous stationary moment as his eyes glared back into the charging , monstrous mass of water , screamed wildly , raising his eyes instinctively to the sky : " Stern All ! . . . Stern All ! . . . Christ ! I 'm out here with a gang of pansies ! " The boat , however , had gained momentum . It was backing water straight out to sea , straight at its great enemy , which the oarsmen now could see plainly . Towering in cold , dispassionate ferocity , the wave scooped down upon them at terrific speed . By the time the stern of the whaleboat had met the base of the wave , the boat was travelling fast enough to neutralize somewhat the speed of the sea . The boat stood comparatively still while the comber passed under it ; but this is not what seemed to happen . As if it were going to loop the loop , the whaleboat appeared to dart up the massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge of foam that had begun to sprout all along its length . This was the moment on which hung the fate of all in the boat . They waited consciously , waited so consciously that the period of waiting seemed to them grotesque , for their craft to climb upon the crest of the wave . This it would do if the boat 's crew had plied their oars with the proper strength and evenness , if the cursing Cruck had handled his long steering oar with skill and accuracy : in short , if the whaleboat had been backed at a precise right angle into the wave at a speed sufficient to maintain that angle before the force of the wave , and thus prevent her from being carried along in front of it . Otherwise , the boat would end for end , spilling , like peas from a pod , the helpless men into the sea in a chaos of oars , boat and tons of insane water that meant pounding , smothering destruction ; or the boat would jerk broadside on to the sea , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of flotsam , to fill with water and capsize . With Cruck fighting his oar in a raging , brutal aggressiveness that seemed to lend personality to the liquid monster that gripped it , the whaleboat leapt onto the top of the wave . Those in the other boat waiting beyond the broken water glimpsed it for an instant there , hull and blades bereft of water , hanging atop the burst of immaculate and dazzling white foam like a dark water-beetle , its legs , fine straight black lines against the morning blue , waggling slightly as the men in swift desperation renewed their grips on the oars . As the whaleboat slid down the long , slanting back of the wave , the crew at Cruck 's order now pulled vigorously with it . For the time that they could cling there on the wave with their oars , the boat travelled shoreward in a gale of speed . Soon , however , the wave left them behind amidst an uncertain series of small peaks and troughs through the spume of which they continued to pull strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for their stroke : " Yo ! . . . yo ! . . . heave ! . . . heave ! . . . yo ! . . . yo ! . . . yo ! ... heave ! ... " The battle was not over by any means . Behind them curled  | and thundered another monster almost as large as the first . Again the boat reversed its direction , met the enemy , was flung high in the air to come down precisely on the wave 's back and speed shoreward . Time and again they thus met the immensities of water , escaped their ferocity and tricked them into becoming beasts of burden . The last one , much smaller and much easier to deal with than the others , carried the boat out of deep water onto the slope of the beach . When Cruck felt bottom with his steering oar , he yelled , " Trail Oars , " threw his oar at the water and leapt overboard . The boat 's crew almost at the same moment dropped their oars into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on short trailing lines , dragged sternward , clinging close to the sides with the onward motion of the boat . The crew , nearly waist deep in water , seized the gunwales and with the help of the sea 's rush dragged the boat up on the beach before the back-wash could develop . For a moment the men became a clot of wild gesticulation , an exultant shout . Over the raging field of water came an answering cheer from the other boat waiting the signal to come in . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had told Bidot to hold off , unless disaster overtook the first boat , until he got a signal . The officer wanted to locate the mouth of the river so that the second boat could , if possible , head right into it . Not only would this be easier than landing on the beach , but it also would save all the work that now faced the first boat in getting to the river once it was located . As Lieutenant Fitzpatrick looked about him , he could see nothing of either a cave or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . a background of impenetrable-looking mountains ... a high , barren cliff down which writhed a thin , lacy waterfall . . . a small cove to the right seemingly choked with bamboo and fantastic vegetation . " It 's probably in there , " thought Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . He had not been able to detect the mouth of this cove from the ship because its small entrance channel ran almost parallel with the line of the beach . As soon as the boat 's crew had put on their shoes and everybody was in possession of a belt , rifle  | and bayonet , he made for the little cove . The moment he was at its mouth he saw the " river , " a creek some fourteen feet wide , sneaking unctuously in a quick turn towards an indentation in the beach that almost reached the cove 's mouth . Slow and obscure as the stream looked , a sounding , taken with a rod of cane cut from a cluster that sprouted from the precipitous side of the cove 's entrance , proved it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border of the stream , they got inside the cove , a groinlike niche of a pool at the base of a bare , belly-shaped mountain . The place literally was clogged with lush creepers , stiff aggressive clusters of delicately leaved cane and great orchidlike plants that drooped from every fungus-spotted vantage ' point of damp shade . A heavy fragrance , equivocally agreeable , like a strangely perfumed perspiration , seemed to stir and drift , now faint , now strong , in the confined air . The men turned their faces up towards the rough triangle of intense , vague blue that covered rather than served as sky . The mouth of the cave , in a globular bulge of smooth rock , formed the triangular pool 's farther limit , its apex . It was a round , repellent hole some fourteen feet in diameter , imbued with a quality of being alive and surrounded with a tangle of hairy vegetation . It was plain , as had been rumoured , that the only way to get into it was by boat . At the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a foothold on either edge of the stream , which , for all its remarkable pellucidity , somehow gave the impression , as it issued from the hole , that it was a spirt of excrement . With the topography of the situation clear in his mind , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick wrote out a short message to Bidot that described in detail the course of the stream from the beach into the pool . On the beach where the hidden stream slipped into the sea between breakers , the men erected , as markers , two oars with undershirts hanging from the blades , one on either side of the channel 's mouth . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick gave his message to Warrington , a member of the Landing Party in his boat , who , with the piece of paper between his teeth , climbed up the seaward face of the shoulder that formed one side of the cove . When the Seaman found himself in front  | of a dark clump of vegetation against the background of which the movements of his arms would be plainly visible from the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the other whaleboat out there tossing patiently . Fastening the paper to a projecting twig so that he could read it merely by turning his head as he squarely faced the boat , he extended his arms and semaphored , " Attention . " Almost at once one of Bidot 's arms went up in a motion that signified he was ready to receive . The end of the semaphored message precipitated the boat into immediate action . It headed quickly into the troubled water . While Bidot had been waiting for the signal ordering him to come in , he had spent his time studying the characteristics of the enemy with which he was to grapple . He observed that the big combers charged one after another in groups of three and that between these groups there were stretches of comparative calm broken only by smaller waves that to him seemed not so dangerous . Giving his commands in a strong voice that had the quality of a high , broad , mellifluous whistle , he nursed his boat right up to the heaving edge of the rough water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too close , working slowly forward again if he drifted away . When he got the order to come in , he counted off three of the big waves that seemingly first took form and being but a few yards to landward of his bow , and at the moment when the third one just had gotten under way to his eye , he sang out : " Give Way Together ! " In the wake of this third big wave , he timed as fast a stroke as his crew was capable of maintaining . . . " stroke ! . . . stroke ! ... stroke ! " ... With his tall , slim body somewhat bent in the direction of his steering oar handle , about which he appeared to sway slightly as if he were not quite able to resist entirely the fight in the oar , he headed straight for the beach , regardless of the intermediate waves that dashed water in the boat and struck frantically at the stern trying to shove it to one side or up in the air . Every trick these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering oar , and he was nearly half-way in before one of the big waves of a new group loomed up behind the whaleboat.  | The Captain , watching from Delilah 's bridge with Ensign Snell and Ensign Woodbridge , was so entertained by the manner in which this boat had evaded most of the big combers that his wrinkles rearranged themselves in a smile that took in his whole face . He shook his head in a manner that seemed to partake of pleasant , hopeless envy , and turning his head from his binoculars to Ensign Snell , he said . " Slick as paint , that fellow . " Bidot 's boat quickly backwatered into its first major antagonist , mastered it and rode so far in on its back that the following giant , after the boat successfully had mounted its crest , carried her all the way to the beach . In the broken water , flung along at great speed by the rush of foaming sea , he used the long , heavy steering sweep with such effective grace , a grace compounded of beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him there , his straight-hanging hair almost framed by the morning sun , his willowy body swaying surely on his long legs in the pointed stern of the whaleboat , from which it seemed to grow , this sight of him elicited shouts and whistles of admiration from the intently watching men on the beach . Dead on at the beach shot the whaleboat , as if it had been a well-aimed torpedo , clean between the two upright oars erected as markers . As the boat passed into the mouth of the stream , Bidot sang : " Toss Oars ! " The momentum carried the boat smartly forward , and Bidot managed the turn with his steering oar partly levering against the right bank . The boat passed the entrance to the pool , cut across the still water within and drifted to a stop just before the entrance of the cave , its six oars pointing stiffly up like a cluster of skyward-aimed spears . The rowers were gasping with their effort . The perspiration poured down their bare arms , drenched their eyes . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unclenching their hands . It took considerable work to get the first whaleboat into the river . They cut thick tubes of bamboo and using them for rollers under the boat trundled it up the smooth beach near the edge of the sea until they got it to the channel 's bank . Every now and  | then one of the bamboo rollers would sink into a soft patch of sand and then Lieutenant Fitzpatrick would make them lift the heavy weight ahead . He was afraid that if the boat were dragged over the sand it would injure the bottom . To those on the distant ship , relaxing , into a reawareness of their normal oppression and fundamental fatigue , from the exhilaration of watching their friends run the surf , the men working with that boat off there all at once became a cluster of barefoot alien pygmies struggling frantically on the margin of golden membrane that bordered this remote and demoniac shore , a shore almost lost at the base of the mountains that towered above it . Like a blue-hazed phantasmagoria , the mountains rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective , of great , flat , cloudy peaks in uncertain ridged outline , and of vast explosive-looking domes , insubstantial , greenspotted , pregnant , unnatural . Well before noon the two boats were lined up on the surface of the pool , Cruck 's boat , containing Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , in the lead , ready to penetrate the river . The rudders had been shipped in place of the steering sweeps . A man was stationed in each bow armed with a boat-hook , and fastened to the hull in front of him was a lighted bunker lamp . Several more of these small paraffin torches were distributed down the lengths of both craft . It was impossible to use oars because the cave was too narrow , and so men with long lengths of bamboo posted in the stern of each boat made ready to pole them upstream . There on the sunny , still surface of the pool , the thud and roar of the surf outside seemed abstract , incredible , faintly threatening . The men , tensing a little forward on the thwarts , rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly , secretive hole to which the bows of the whaleboats pointed . 24 For many yards the cave went straight in , its low rounded roof and sides gleaming wet and unhealthy in the eerie white daylight that followed the boats in and mixed uncertainly with the yellow sway and flicker from the paraffin torches . Every  | now and then a man would throw a quick glance over his shoulder at the diminishing circle of white glow that marked the entrance . Even after the narrow gut , barely a few inches wider than the whaleboats , had made a ninety degree turn into deep gloom , intense concentration on the shifting walls of the passage was rewarded by a sense of faint , white stain that had managed to make the turn and pierce in from the bright world being left behind . The young Seaman , Warrington , sitting between thwarts in the bottom of the first whaleboat , was suffering the impression that he was penetrating the body of some huge living animal , an impression suggestively abetted by the heavy smell of bats and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting and expanding , in the twisting play of the torch light , as if preparing to eliminate this foreign matter clawing along within it . In the bow of the boat Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was straining his eyes ahead into the implacable darkness , seeking for the moment when this thin tube would widen out or merely change . He was struggling with a faint obsession that the tube was narrowing and that the boat would jam suddenly and be caught there . He restrained an order to the man with the pole to go slower . As if he were one of a group of conspirators huddled in a moment of precarious silence , he was startled and irritated on the instant by Hardwood 's voice crashing confusedly in the passage with jibes at Cruck because the Chief Boatswain 's Mate kept a firm grip on the tiller . " Whea do y ' think the boat 's a goin ' to if y ' take y ' hand off ? " hooted Hardwood . The men in the boats tried to laugh at this , but the ugly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . No one , however , could bear the silence of the unending push through this stream of liquid winding down against them . Men shouted to each other from boat to boat meaningless phrases that set up wild , hollow whirlpools of sound in the musky obscurity . The shouts only accentuated the confinement and unnaturalness they were intended to relieve . At the stern of the second boat , the pleasantly taciturn Petrie , who in  | the sunlight was a very red-faced man with glistening black eyes , could resist neither this unnaturalness nor the impression that what he was thrusting into with his pole was not water . More than once in relapses of silence that seemed to have conquered and benumbed the others , he had shouted : " This stuff never gets very deep . " The minute-after-minute sameness in appearance of the passage walls in the murky flare and waver of the torches , and the monotonous progress of the boats under the slow , even thrusts of the polers gave rise to bickering discussion as to whether the boats had made any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been in that labyrinthine pall all morning , that the current of the stream and the efforts of the polers served merely to neutralize each other . A man insisted on replacing Petrie at the pole , and this change was emulated loudly in the first boat . Someone tried to start a song , but when two or three others took it up it became mere uproar that quickly subsided , leaving in its wake curses , protests and the inexorable scourge of Hardwood 's sallies . In the midst of this , some cavities , like giant black flowers blossoming above them to right and left , appeared in the wall of the passage . The darkness of their areas was so profound that , like surfaces , they appeared to repel the yellow stabs of torch light ; and as the boats passed the spots over which the cavities leaned , they seemed to absorb and change the quality of the noise that arose from the boats . This intimidated the men . Some of them lowered their heads while the boats floated past as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mothlike creature , evidently disturbed by the noise , drifted flutteringly down from one of the cavities and then up again into another . Some distance past these cavities , a dim , liquid rumble began to grow in their ears , a smother of sound like the sustained repercussion of a drum . Never violent , the sound increased in volume as the boats progressed . Warrington was realizing uneasily that Heller , the Pharmacist 's Mate , who sat close to him , was getting nervous . When Heller , struggling a trifle with his breath and looking straight up at the close , dank top of the passage , said " Christ ! ... This  | is just like being buried alive , " Warrington felt clearly the urge to make some kind of joke . The urge did not arise from any desire to relieve Heller 's nervousness , nor from any desire to protect himself from it . There appeared to be merely the coincidence that the same moment that had produced Heller 's remark also had clarified his own feeling of need . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would grow in his mind . He waited for minutes trying to think of one as a man listens for an expected sound . Then in a query shouted up and down the boats in what for the Chief Boatswain 's Mate was a pleading tone , Warrington sensed an opportunity for his unfamiliar exigency . " Who 's got some chewin ' tobacco ? " Cruck 's repeated shout began to drum through the general stress like a pointed chant . It searched out the reluctant Petrie and forced him to reach into the pocket of his white jumper and pull out a tooth-marked plug a few seconds before the grimly resisting Ferguson was ready to admit that he had some . The man beside Petrie , catching a glimpse of the tobacco in a flash of the torch light , yelled : " Here 's some . . . Petrie 's got some . " " Pass it forward . . . Pass it forward . " Cruck was by no means an addict nervously dependent on chewing tobacco ; he took it in the general run with food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been overheard for the first time , would have given the definite impression that he was . Petrie prepared to pass the plug of tobacco forward , half standing in the moving boat and steadying himself against the jerky impulses of the poling with one hand on the gunwale . A man a couple of places ahead of him reached aft to receive the plug so that he could pass it on . At this moment , Warrington shouted in a shrill , antagonistic voice , completely devoid of the humour with which he had intended to fill it : " Never mind passing it now ... He 's found some . " With his nervous appetite complicated by astonishment and irritation over this incomprehensible check , Cruck 's mental machinery made no effort to solve its purpose . He stuck persistently to the material objective before him :  | " God damn it ! " he roared , " Pass that tobacco ! " Petrie again got the tobacco ready to pass , thinking there had been some misunderstanding . Embarrassed and bewildered over the addled situation into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his role . " There goes some , " he shouted , shrilly trying to disguise his voice , " He 's got some now , Petrie . " Having recognized the way Warrington pronounced his name , and having been led away by this from perceiving that Warrington was trying to disguise his voice , Petrie took the shout seriously and put the plug of tobacco back in his pocket . Cruck had stood up in the stern of the boat , an aroused bulk distorted by shadow and the flicker of torches , to watch the progress of the tobacco being passed up to him . When it had not come , and he saw no passing movement amidst the shadowy clots that represented knees , hands and elbows down the length of the other boat , he screamed raspingly : " Where 's that lousy tobacco ? " He began to stamp ferociously and swing his fist . The din and the wildness of his movements agitated the men in both craft . " Sit down ! . . . You 're rockin ' the boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A furious sense of injustice was racking Cruck , and this shout from one who was not even in his boat seemed the last straw . Not trying to shout anything intelligible , simply emitting a crescending , frantic hurricane of sound , Cruck roared . He jerked out the tiller and brandished it . Petrie , as if he were somehow guilty , again dove into his pocket with quick furtiveness for the plug of tobacco . He held it straight up in the air and kept it there . Before he spoke he swiped at the perspiration on his troubled red face with the sleeve of his stiffly raised arm . " Here it is ... Warrington said you had some . " His mouth twisting and almost drooling with rage , Cruck lunged forward toward Warrington in the bow , trying to strike , even at this futile distance , with the clubbed tiller . " I 'll brain that bastard ! " he yelled .  | He lurched into a stumbling fall over the men before him . A bulky tangle of bodies struggled in defensive turmoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precariously . Even in the other boat men instinctively put out steadying hands against the wall of the narrow passage as if to keep their craft from capsizing , and their poler permitted it to drift with the current back away from the tumult ahead . There simmered a brief moment of heaving silence , amidst which the sound of water rippling past the boats became the most definite sound . Then Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's voice could be heard cutting through this turbulent stillness like an authoritative lash : " Pipe down there ! . . . Pipe down ! . . . Keep your places ! " The swad of men slowly disentangled itself in the stern of the wildly rocking boat . Cruck sat up sullenly , a little confused but still clutching the tiller as if he were going to use it as a club . Warrington sat stiffly in the bottom of the boat , hot with selfstultification . " Let 's have that damn tobacco , " ordered Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . Petrie still was holding it up in the air . Someone snatched it and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a shout of " Stand from under ! " tossed it accurately across the widening stretch of spectral water into the first boat . It hit Wright in the chest and fell at his feet . He stooped to pick it up , calling out with a trace of triumph and relief : " I got it , Sir . " " Pass it to Cruck , " said the officer shortly . With a gesture reeking of petulant , half-ashamed satisfaction , Cruck received the plug and fiercely bit off a large wad of it . " You with the pole there , " commanded Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . His voice , as it left his lips , bloated into a monstrous resonance that pounded and surged back upon the words that followed . " Keep her moving . " The poler , who had been holding the boat stationary by using his pole to jam it against the side of the passage ever since he feared it might capsize , gave it a responsive shove forward . The  | boat scraped around a turn into a deeper gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the turn . There was only one torch left burning in the front boat . The others had been smothered or knocked overboard in the struggle . All at once the poler ceased his effort and held the bamboo high poised while he stared intently ahead . The man with the remaining torch attempted to hold it aloft so that the scene ahead would be better illuminated . It fell from his fingers and sputtered out in the water . The darkness contracted heavily . The poler could be heard levering the boat against the wall . The men tried to stare before them , struggling with superstitious dread that was becoming panic . The darkness , dank and horrible , was almost alive , palpable , vegetable , like an enveloping fungoid growth . " Strike a light , " ordered Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . His voice came through the obscurity over-controlled , tense , unnatural ; but this quality was disguised by the way his voice vibrated shudderingly , in this part of the cave , like the deep tones of an organ . It seemed to strike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear boat swung around the turn , casting before it a spasmodic glow from its torches . " I want my tobacco back , " said Petrie plaintively , almost apologetically , as he caught shadowy sight of the forward boat . No one listened to him . Every faculty , every fixed gaze was thrusting ahead , beyond the dying rings of the feverish , aborted joke that had racked them like a delirium , to where , in the near distance up there , it could be indeterminately sensed that the narrow , oppressive tube in which they were floating , this place of slimy entombment , had come to an end . By the added light of the two torches that finally were lit in the first boat , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick saw , certainly enough , that they had gone as far as they could go in the boats . The river came to an end against a towering cliff whose pale , livid surface , fading into the gloomy heights above , was of the waxy colour inside a mouth . From the face of the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there projected a sort of  | giant nipple , elongated and obscene , out of which water oozed thickly and cascaded down with a blurred , drumming sound to the stream on which the boats floated . On the left , in the wall of the passage just before it reached the cliff , a long thin cavity hung a few feet above the stream 's surface , shadowy and grim like the parted lips of an unhealing wound . Reluctantly , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick saw that this forbidding slit was an opening through which he could take the Landing Party if it led anywhere . He ordered the boats to approach the cavity . The disinclination of the men behind him fairly beat upon his back . Nevertheless , the first whaleboat cut through the water and came to a stop beneath the opening . It rested against the wall there almost noiselessly as against a buffered and welloiled dock face . The other boat crept up . In the combined glare of all the torches available it could be seen clearly that the floor of the cavity mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less than two feet above the gunwale of the boat . " Up you go , men , " said Lieutenant Fitzpatrick brusquely , and swung himself up on the ledge . Cruck followed heavily like a bull charging at some unnatural obstacle slumbering in darkness . The rest of the men followed one by one . The floor of the ledge , where they put their hands on it to pull themselves up , was repulsive to the touch , lubricious and slightly yielding . Although they were dripping with moisture , the odious atmosphere of the place seemed to pulse out at them in dry , bubblelike gusts from the interior of the cavity . It seemed to them as if they were beginning to smother . Deep in this gloomy maze , lost and helpless within the vague , feculent recesses of this monstrous mountain , the men silently revolted against the hole full of sable nothingness before them . Their eyes sought the officer uncertainly . In him , too , the nervous tension of the past days was finding its opportunity to claw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the outside of him , on every area beneath which flinched a nerve , there throbbed the blurred drum of that waterfall . " Line up ! " He flung the order at them with the sharp arro-  | gance and inhuman assurance that so arouses resentment in the civilian who witnesses a professional officer about his duties . The flick of this order , devoid of any sympathy that might have abetted the weakening of their strength , restored these men in measurable degree to the exacting world of steel and regulation in which they belonged , and in which , under the assurance of this superior being 's tone , all still was well . They lined up , rifle butts planted firmly in the fleshlike muck under their feet . " Atten . . . tion ! . . . Count Off ! " " One , two , three , four . . . One , two , three , four . . . " " Front ! ... Right by Squads . . . For . . . ward ... March ! " Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their serried bayonets flashing in the torchlight , the detachment marched forward , its slim officer poised aggressively at the obscurity and mystery ahead . 25 As they left the river well behind , the narrow tunnel began to expand so rapidly that they soon found themselves in what appeared to be illimitable space . The visceral dampness gave way to an intense dryness that seemed to have turned the very air into dust . The smooth powder underfoot swirled up about them to form a great , rotund cloud in which the torch flames , now small distinct spirts devoid of illumination , leant steadily backward as in a still mist . Their numerous feet striking in heavy unison seemed to beget only a blurred " puff , puff , puff . " The dust mixed with the perspiration on their faces , necks and hands to cover them with a finely textured mud . It appeared to them that they were marching across a vast plain in hazy night . Actually , it was darker than it had been in the passage , for now the light from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it felt less dark , as if there were a pervading , nocturnal glimmer through which they could not see . There was an illusion of the sky being somewhere above them , and now and then a marching man would bend back his head as if straining to find a star or the glimmering delineation of a far horizon .  | 26 They had been marching a long way it seemed , doggedly , knees a little bent as the plain tilted upward , heads bowed with growing fatigue . The dead world through which they marched seemed greedy to suck away their strength , to turn them into the drooping , albino things one finds growing in darkness . It made them silent . Too , the sound of a voice , when it came , was so empty and lost that it intimidated them . The hill they were climbing grew steeper ; then suddenly they were going down the other side . Without an order they stopped . " Rest , " said Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . Huddled together there in the darkness , beneath the unseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , pale , powdery hill at the tenebrous core of a buried universe , they unconsciously ringed themselves in with pointed bayonets . They held futile torches out into the gloom , sought to pierce it with long , fixed stares . " I wish to hell we was gettin ' back to the ship , " said Wright softly , running his hand over his pimply face and through his straw-coloured hair . His hand felt strange in the slime of dust and sweat that mired his head . He absently pulled his hand down near a torch and looked at it . " Him wants to get back to mama , " essayed Hardwood loudly , trying to mimic a child . His negroid voice seemed to spurt down from somewhere , thin , muffled and weird , its attempt at caricature redistorted . For an instant , men at some distance from Hardwood , not recognizing the sound , opened their eyes wide and gripped their rifles tighter . There was not even a shadow of laughter . " Cruck . " Lieutenant Fitzpatrick spoke sharply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this compass . " Using the top of his stiff , white cap , laid on the dust , as a miniature table , the officer displayed a small , pocket instrument at which he had been glancing as he marched along . Beside it he laid a pad of paper .  | " You see , I 've tried to sketch our course here since we left the mouth of the cave . " As Cruck peered down through the flicker of a torch , drops of muddy perspiration spotted the top of the hat and the sheet of paper . With a preoccupied gesture the Chief Boatswain 's Mate briefly raised his big head and tried to shake it free of the moisture . " Yes , Sir . " " The lubber-line lies with the flow of the river as we left it . " " Yes , Sir . " Lieutenant Fitzpatrick stuck the point of the pencil on the piece of paper . " And here we are now . " The men crowded forward about the pencil point , stared down intently at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look hopefully from that mark around into the inert , surrounding gloom . " I want you , " continued Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , " to take five men and march at right angles to our present course , " he pointed the direction with his arm , " until you come to the wall of this place in that direction . Look along the wall both ways and then come back and report . Understand ? " His big blunt finger nails fumbling slowly at the top of his scalp , Cruck said once more , but with a kind of aggressive uncertainty : " Yes , Sir . " " If you get out of sight , the glow of our torches above us will mark our position . Do n't lose that . " Cruck stood for a moment looking down at the compass and piece of paper as if these were the last , vanishing fragments of a familiar and regretted shore-line . There was no sound , no movement . Then : " Ferguson ! " Cruck 's voice was challenging . As if this summons were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk with both hands at the top of his trousers , spat truculently at the vague dust and stepped clear of the others . " Here ! "  | " Forsythe ! " " Here . " " Saunders ! " " Here . " He reluctantly stepped out to join the other two . " Horner ! . . . and Ragatzo ! " " Here , " came the uneven chorus of the two voices . " Let 's go . " The six men suddenly tramped straight out into the unnatural night without a look behind . The others stood staring after them with eyes that were troubled with concern . " Sit down and take it easy , " said Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . A few sat or lay down in the dust ; but all eyes continued to watch the slowly fading glare in the distance . Just before the little group had dropped from sight beneath the cloudy reflection of its torches , it had glowed for a moment , sharp , clearly delineated , miniature , atop a far-off knoll like a squad of tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no taking it easy . Lying there in the fine , soft dust , their feeling of being in a mysterious and unnatural place piled up about them like a smothering mound of the strange dust in which they lay . As if the thought had been spoken and all emphatically had agreed on it , the idea fastened itself in each man 's mind that the only possible thing to do now was to go back . Their restlessness increased . They became unhealthily conscious of their skins , their ears , their armpits . Apparently , the only thing holding them from starting back at once was the absent reconnoitring party , and they concentrated their whole attention on its possible manoeuvring and imminent return . Orlop , the tall , dapper Chief Gunner 's Mate , got to his feet and stared in the direction of the place where he last had observed the glow of Cruck 's party . Little wisps of dust , like smoke , slowly drifted down from about his body . He shaded his staring eyes with his hand . Other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed also . " I do n't see them any more , " Orlop said . A quick , portentous murmur swept the men . " I see them , " said Lieutenant Fitzpatrick definitely .  | He did see them ; but the glow was now but a thin , flat blur , very faint in the distance . " Make a bunker lamp fast to the tip of a bayonet and set the rifle up on that rifle stack , " ordered Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , " It 'll give them a better bead on us. " 27 The far darkness , across which one of Cruck 's men nostalgically swept his eyes , suddenly was pricked by a rising point of light . " Look , " he said , " they must be comin ' . " Like a great , ill-humoured rat looking for a hole , Cruck had fumbled along the smooth , precipitous wall for two or three hundred yards in each direction . Now he swung about and stared at the point of light belligerently . " Naw . It do n't move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 've got a Very pistol , " said Ferguson . " Yea , but this means something , " insisted Cruck in a tone carrying with it the implication that he would brook no interference whatsoever in this . He was fed up with stumbling along this wall . Anyhow , he had carried out his orders . There were no openings or anything else . " That light , " he told himself , " was gon na be recall whether it meant that or not . " 28 Lieutenant Fitzpatrick observed with satisfaction the rising glow in the distance that indicated the return of Cruck 's party . He shared silently the exclamations of relief that popped around amongst the men as they also observed this sign . He sensed that this feeling of relief involved not only the safe return of Cruck 's party , and the relaxation of the curious emotion twisting at the members of a group that has been forced apart , but also the feeling that now the whole detachment would start back out of the cave . Probably he sensed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Cruck 's party  | rejoined , there was a clamour of profane celebration , blurred eerily by the cavernous environment . The officer 's participation in this was a smile and an instinctive turning to his friend Warrington . Their eyes met through the sombre , shifting glow in a brief , gay glance . Sharply , the officer ceased smiling and looked away as if he had caught himself off-guard . He struggled constantly now to keep the open play of their relationship confined to the watches on the bridge . Although he invariably took Warrington with him when he led the Landing Party ashore , he tried meticulously to preserve the same attitude toward him that he maintained toward each of the other enlisted men . Somehow he could not bring himself to leave Warrington behind . He told himself that " that would be leaning over backwards " ; but what deeply impelled him was , in part , the foreknowledge of the distress that such a measure certainly would inflict upon Warrington . Moreover , he found repugnant the expedient of explaining the necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prospect , something clandestine and esoteric that the spoken words of such an explanation would evoke and admit . He preferred the impossible compromise of confining the active life of their proscribed friendship to the hours on the bridge and attempting to preserve as hiatuses the periods that stretched between , safe , static stretches in which their relationship would neither die nor live . That Warrington understood his effort did not seem to save the boy from being wounded by it . Each time the officer , in a moment of forgetfulness , looked at his friend as a friend , he would find in his eyes a clear , cerebral resignation to the necessity ; but deep beyond this was an eagerness , a welcome , and a resentment as well , the perception of which poignantly complicated the general stresses that each day seemed more fiercely to be rending the very sanity from the officer 's being . He stood there now , ankle deep in that repulsive dust , dejected , nearly at the end of his physical endurance , fighting down the hysterical threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost at the mercy of this rebellion . It was not in his nature to dissipate it by probing analysis .  | For him it was a surface entity in itself , like joy or hate . He apprehended only , as he felt Warrington there , that this was his friend , more disturbingly than anybody ever had been his friend before . . . yet it must not be his friend . . . it must be merely one of these men . . . these men for whose lives he was responsible . . . buried here in this ghastly place . . .

" There 's nothing there , Mr. Fitzpatrick , except blank wall ... We went along it for about two hundred yards each way from the point we struck it . . . It runs about parallel with the course we been travelling . " " Fall In , " said the officer . " We 're going back , ai n't we , Mr. Fitzpatrick ? " ventured Petrie.  | " Let 's go , " said the officer , ignoring the question . He swung mechanically around and headed for the wall from which the reconnoitrers just had returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his knee and his head was bowed . His eyes were following the disturbance in the dust left by Cruck 's party . Less man now than years of drill and indoctrination , the officer was marching heavily , mechanically to the beat that rose in his mind ... " hateful mission . . . hideous tomb ... " The men drew together and watched him tramp off into the darkness in a direction that crushed their conviction that they now were going back . They were aghast , almost enraged . " Gee , Mr. Fitzpatrick , " called out Ferguson , " I 'll he a son of a bitch if there 's ever been anybody in here . " Through the ensuing moments of silence they stared in terrible reluctance at the fateful flicker and blur of their officer 's form slowly assuming distance . " Come on . . . You bastards ! " ground out Cruel : . Heavily averse , the mob of men moved slowly forward . Their shoulders were hunched , their knees bent , as if they were bucking an elastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Wright . His voice had a stertorous , plaintive quality . " What the hell do you care ? You ai n't goin ' no place , " said Hardwood . " Keep yer God damn traps shut ! " raged Cruck . They began to progress a little faster . Orlop , the Chief Gunner 's Mate , and " Unc " Blood , the Chief Quartermaster , moved ahead through the gloom and overtook Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . To the men who had formed Cruck 's reconnoitring party the climbing and descending march along the ridge now seemed much longer than when they had made it before . At the wall , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick stopped . He gazed at the smooth , scabrous surface before him . Holding high his torch , he let his eyes follow the wall up to where it dissolved in the equivocal night . Then his gaze came down to where the wall stretched relentlessly on ahead .  | " Where to now , Mr. Fitzpatrick ? " asked the Chief Gunner 's Mate . The tall man always spoke suavely and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as it goes , then follow it back on the other side to where the boats are . " Orlop stepped forward and began to march along the base of the wall . " Unc " Blood , his beard thick with the mud of sweat and dust , trudged after him . Cruck and the crowd of men , slogging through the dust as if it were deep snow , were almost upon the officer before he too began to move again . Every now and then Cruck would turn around , walking backward for a few steps , and glare at the massed sway of faces struggling close in his wake beneath the flat ruddy cloud of smoky torch light . They glared back at him as if fiercely reflecting the aspersion in his stare . Marching steadily on and on , pressed unremittingly against this smooth , pale , unending wall to the left as if by the unliving violence of the sick , lunar void to the right , the massed marching slowly became the only manifestation of their beings . Heads down , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their very personalities became dissolved in the entity of the marching . They became a clot of heavy , hypnotic liquid , alive only with idiot movement , seeping through the arid murk . They would have marched forever , now , in this manner , through this vast , nihilistic smother , until they dropped unnoticed one by one , slowly to be absorbed and covered there by this bottomless sediment of patterned nothingness through which they struggled . All at once those in the lead sensed that the wall on their left was no longer there . Another wall loomed before them . Automatically they stopped . Like dim echoes of far sounds , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's thoughts were shouting spasmodically : ... " This is the other wall . . . the place narrows here . " The spot that marked the furthermost limit of the void in which they had been marching , the rotund angle to which it narrowed , was pitted by a stark , vertical slit about as tall as a man and as broad as three . Its edges seemed to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the torches . In calm delirium Lieutenant Fitzpatrick surveyed the hole ; then he walked into it . With a cumbrous lurch the clot of men resumed its marching . To penetrate the narrow passage the mass had to attenuate . This slowly began to restore its submerged units to individuality . Men here and there raised their heads , used their eyes and sniffed alertly like startled animals . The wispy air in the passage seemed to feel for them , fumble about their ankles , their hands , their faces , their necks , then steal past them . It was moist , odourless , bestial . They became conscious of a persisting sound , an indistinct but immense , gurgling rush . Resonant and oppressive , it turned the thin passage into a living tube suffering monstrous strangulation . The men themselves seemed unable to breathe . They had difficulty in commanding their feet . Some pawed roughly at their throats , clutched at the close walls to keep from tumbling . They were drenched with sweat . Their eye-balls appeared to stretch and protrude painfully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The passage narrowed . The ceiling gradually closed in upon them . Their miserable desperation expanded , pounded at the contracting walls , grew vague , tenuous , but not less poignant . They strove forward as against a barely resistible , repelling force . Suddenly the three in the lead jerked to a stop . They held themselves rigid , then bent over something at their feet , their bodies leaning in tense curves . More men slowly crowded up from behind . There in the firm , hardly impressible substance underfoot was the imprint of a boot . Thin , stabbing , electrical currents , eerie and breath destroying , rained against their loins , their wrists , their lungs . The pits of their stomachs dissolved , became painful space . The print was like nothing they ever had seen before . With its sharp , pointed toe , flaring sole and small , deep heel , it was both brutal and womanish . There was only one . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick raised his eyes and glared into the funnelling darkness ahead . His throat began to beat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of his  | head . Groping with his pistol before him , he crept forward , cringing over the stony surface close to the wall , away from the ugly , firm clay in which that print glistened , insolent and otherworldly . Men fell to all fours , dragging their weapons after them , like prognathous animals clawing and battling forward to undefeated death . Their breathing came in ugly gasps . They were covered with sweat and pale dust-mud that turned them to the colour of the walls . The noise , jittering like the drums of a monstrous rumba , the ever-increasing tenseness , the slick , sucking surface up which they crawled , the fluttering current of air , all seemed to merge in the leprous darkness before them and push them back . Two yards forward . . . three more .. . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick in the lead had ceased moving . . . He was stretched , stiff and ominous , on his stomach with his chin thrust forward as if he were staring fiercely . As they held there , they realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up now , clearer , heavier , more insistent . Without moving his head , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick slowly reached back and fumbled for the arm of the man behind him who held a torch . The man gave it up as if against his will . The officer stuck the torch out before him . Like a fatal , ritualistic gesture , this called into shadowy being , there a few yards in front of them , an uneven gash of a chasm brimming with thick , black swirls of tortured liquid . On the bank of the chasm was a boat . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick dropped the torch , retrieved the pistol from his left hand and rearing back on his knees raised the weapon before him . In slipping , blundering ferocity , the men massed up at his back . Their eyes stabbed at the blank wall that ended the passage . . . at the torrent at its foot . . . at the surface to the left from which the liquid sprang . . . over the surface to the right into which it disappeared . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lonely and formidable in the gloom . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick fastened his gaze on the boat . The intensity of his concentration brought his tormented consciousness up to a fever of attention as a blast of air drives nearly expended embers to incandescence . It took all his being , all  | of him that was stricken with the horror of isolation in these slimy buried depths , all of him that smouldered with despair over the disasters that threatened his ship and his personal world , and drove it into the grim outlines of that mysterious , small boat . Glowing there , a precise phantom , the boat struggled with his attention like something on the horizon that barely escapes identification . High of bow and even higher of square stern , the quality of the short craft drifted over him , took hold of his driven and lacerated sensibilities , called poignantly to his sense of recognition . He crept closer . Strange as the boat was , it was not Asiatic ; every line of its form protested that . It came to him dimly that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it , too , was an alien in these hideous depths , clutched horribly in black , intangible destruction . Closer still . . . there was a name on the stern . . . it was a ship 's boat ! Cruck was staring over his shoulder . Their bodies moving in weird unison , they leaned precipitously in the direction of their gazing , as if their very flesh was striving to pour itself into the effort at seeing . The faint , barely clinging words were words formed of the alphabet they knew . That was certain . The question of that never even arose in them as an explanation of the illegibility . A name , a name that they could almost read , that tantalized them with the impression that it would be familiar if it could be made out . They moved closer . Still the words blurred there , illegible , as if glimpsed down a vista of obscurity . The officer seized a torch and held it a bare yard from the words . Hanging there like shadows of letters , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tip of the tongue . Through the dusk and horror of this last , innermost recess , through the malevolent , breathless tension and the aura of stricken bodies , Cruck , grinding his teeth , flung his heavy body up in a gesture of final , catastrophic impatience and lunged forward . The crowd of men flinched down , as if such a movement would provoke some occult horror . Cruck loomed for a  | moment over the boat , his head bent truculently towards its stern . The distinct yet indistinct words still evaded him . To jerk the stern of the boat around into the light , his arms shot out and roughly seized it by both gunwales . The boat , down the whole of its unspeakably ancient length , crumpled like a morsel of delicate ash into dust .  | THREE 1 AT ABOUT the moment that Cruck laid hold of the small boat in the cave , the Captain , on board Delilah , received a radio message that lanced instantaneously the deadly gather of tensions oppressing the ship . Without explanation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer was to be expected . Also , Delilah was detached from the duty of searching for the gun-runners and was to proceed , at the discretion of her Commanding Officer , to Cavite for the repairs requested . It was relief , poignant delighting relief , rather than surprise , that rose through the Captain as he read this message . It was as if there never had been in his mind any question but that the relief would come , as if his distress had been merely a matter of its persistent and perverse delay . Now he could head his ship straight away from this hateful coast-line , in the secure light of day , taking shelter as he pleased if he scented threatening weather , or if that shaft began to cut up too badly . Not even what some might consider the flaw in the relieving message impaired his delight . It would mean only a few hours more . That was nothing after what they had gone through . The message instructed him to stop in at Romblon on his way and take aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ensign Woodbridge had helped him decode the message , had exclaimed , with a long exhalation of breath , " Thank God for small favours ! " and had then lain down on his bunk and fallen swiftly and quietly asleep . With the message in his hand , the Captain climbed up to the quarter-deck ; but Ensign Snell was asleep too , dozing patiently , with that extreme patience that characterized him as much as did his laugh . His heavy , white-encased legs were stretched straight out from his chair across the red deck , the weight of his big white shoes  | resting on the edge of the heels , and his head was thrown back , with his arms bent across his face . Every now and then the wicker chair emitted a crackling murmur under the breathing of his heavy body . The Captain stood looking down at him for a few seconds as if considering waking him up ; then he walked around the torpedo-tube and sat down himself . The only outward sign of the Captain 's impatience to take advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beach where the boats had landed . For each of these scrutinies he would walk all the way forward to the bridge before as much as glancing in the direction of the shore ; and once there he would focus his binoculars with unusual care as if some unnatural difficulty were to be expected in piercing the thin brightness of the space intervening . These visits by the Captain to the bridge aroused Arnold , the Quartermaster on watch , to a point of restless competition . " What the hell ! . . . The Old Man knows I 'll get it to him the minute those birds show as much as a hair over there . " He would , he swore to himself , spot them before the Captain did . But , in the end , it was the Captain who sighted them first . The boats suddenly appeared in the little channel leading from the cave pool to the sea . Men leapt from them , shouting and exuberant , to run wildly up and down the beach . Some of them literally danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the sky . Others just walked away from the boats onto the land with an air of finality , in the manner of men walking away from the climax of some punishing and exhausting physical effort . Cruck , his little eyes blinking and his short brutal nostrils flexing tentatively , stood with his legs spread and pounded his deeply breathing chest with his two fists as if he were exercising . Between Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Warrington , standing almost face to face , there flamed a smiling glance of intimate celebration . On the ship , the Captain 's mouth , too , was smiling broadly beneath his binoculars levelled on the outburst ashore . In the first moments , against the background of his own knowledge of release , the turbulent rejoicing in the distance seemed to need  | no explanation . He turned his back , not at all on the scene on the beach but on the fabulous beauty of the repellent land that held it , and , with utter relief , said to Arnold : " Hoist the recall . " 2 The Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one form or another , affecting especially the sensibilities of those who had been projected into the ecstasy of relaxation on returning out of the cave , seemed to absorb the ship and the men in a soft , clear solvent of slack weariness . Delilah appeared to drift effortlessly along an undefined groove in the sea , her illness dormant , the threat somehow gone from her pounding shaft , her perverse and sensitive will bemused . The sounds of her swaying progress through the smooth water were lost in soothing regularity and rhythm ; and in the daytime the heat of her personal fires , even her dominant body odour of heated metal , seemed to lose identity amidst the fiery brightness of the calm world in which she relaxed . It appeared as if the crew simply permitted her to go her own way ; and it was as if by accident that she encountered Romblon Island , drifted past the long reefs shimmering in beautiful patterns just beneath the surface of the transparent sea , through the narrow entrance , and came to rest almost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity . This harbour was embedded in a circle of high , wild hills smothered under jungle that was intimidatingly luxuriant ; and the village , a precise blur of stilted nipa houses , seemed barely able to preserve itself from the excesses of the sporelike vegetation towering about it . A stone cathedral , yellow-grey , startingly over-sized , leaned out of the village toward the harbour like one of the distorted churches in Russian paintings . It was from somewhere in this cathedral that they carried down the body of the Army Officer , twelve barefoot little men distributed around a hastily carpentered coffin , trotting calmly along through vistas of shade , the marvel of cool shade in the tropics , toward the beach . They placed the coffin on a large  | outrigger canoe and , with some of the bearers squatting along the limbs of the outrigger to steady it , paddled across the water to Delilah . The crew stood around unceremoniously , but with their hats off , while Cruck , Petrie , Ferguson and Wright took careful grips on the coffin and hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last moment and Cord , the Boilermaker , although he was not expected to interfere in the duties of the deck force , stepped forward and bent to their assistance his tall , very thin frame , which , with its solemn , narrow , Saxon face and profusion of straight , blond hair , presented a somehow humorous aspect . Some of the men watching his assistance there realized for the first time , although he had been with the ship for years , what a remarkable man he really was . He knew much about boilers that decidedly lay beyond the pale of practical mechanics and in the realm of educated , theoretical engineering ; but in some unobstructive way he managed to escape the prestige of this , to transform the substance of his theory into the matter of the everyday practical mechanics . He was like a country doctor who seemed to prescribe nothing but castor oil , but who impregnated his treatments , as one found by looking into it , with the abstrusities of Johns Hopkins and the Rockefeller Institute . The possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was never known , even once , to have had an altercation , and he presented an appearance of unpointed detachment , not only from the life of the ship but from the very life of the world , that was complete . There always was a faint taint of droll self-depreciation about the expression of his face ; and his weapon for meeting most crises was a slight , childlike smile , not the defensive smile of the Jew , but a passing movement of droll good humour . On his upper lip he wore a pale miniature of a Norseman 's drooping mustache . When the coffin had been carried aft to the quarter-deck and placed there on a cot alongside the torpedo-tube , on the starboard side , just where once the monk had tried to rest , Cord returned with the four deckhands to the outrigger and  | helped unload the papayas and mangoes with which the spaces of the canoe beneath the coffin had been packed , a gift from local authority to the ship ; and then he had stepped back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this event . With the coffin securely aboard , Delilah waited only on the return of Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , who was making an official visit ashore , to steam back out through the channel and resume her northward passage . The arrival of the dead man in the ship had ended the extreme relaxation , had precipitated them all into a quiet , normal functioning and awareness ; but an awareness in which there still was no fear of the time ahead , no restlessness about the weather , nor about the possibility of total breakdown . When they looked into their officers ' faces the men saw there little more disturbing than fatigue . Now they merely were men taking their ship back to Cavite to be repaired . When Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was sighted coming down the narrow dock , the order was given to weigh anchor ; and very shortly after the officer arrived alongside in the whaleboat , bearing a long , brown envelope and an armful of small , weird , white flowers for the Wardroom table , Delilah was steaming slowly for the entrance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awnings and , as if labouring under the delusion that they had not had a regular meal in days , ate great quantities of fried chicken , fried potatoes , stewed canned corn and the papayas that had come in the outrigger with the dead man . Only the men eating at the tables on the starboard side gave any sign that they felt his presence aboard . Once or twice a man slowly stopped eating and stared aft towards the quarter-deck . After such a glance , Hardwood swung himself slightly to the right on the bench so that his back was turned definitely to the direction in which he had glanced . Lights , warm and golden bright , but as yet without illumination , sparked into steady glow throughout the ship . Night imperceptibly was draining the vividness from the long evening . One by one , as they finished eating , men got up and Ieft the supper tables . They moved slowly , almost carefully , as if they consciously were balancing the packed globes of food in their torsos , as if they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been conscripted to deal with their loaded stomachs . Orlop , the tall Chief Gunner 's Mate , had paused at the railing . He was gazing down in pleasant torpidity at the water-line , watching the guard rail sway steadily beneath the water and then above it . . . down . . . up . . . down . . . up . . . then in barely willed casualness he permitted his eyes to lift from this rearward slipping edge of water that flipped at the ship 's side . His gaze drifted his consciousness on and on out through the vast , vague evening tint that filled the universe and absorbed the sea , until , far , far away there , his gaze and his inert being were blurred , dissolved , lost . . . A faint cloud of tobacco smoke wafted across his face . He turned his head . A few paces forward along the rail Hemple , the Machinist 's Mate , was smoking his pipe . He too was staring into the soft , desolate , amethystine depths that still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly forward in the direction of his gaze , and despite his mature , commonplace figure with its paunch , the healthy vulgarity of his firm , rounded face and the down-toearth quality that pervaded his plentitude of coarse , dark hair , he somehow seemed pitiful and alone standing there in this fashion gazing into infinity . Orlop let go of the railing 's top cable and absently glanced at the palms of his hands . The cable had felt greasy with salt . Hemple , as if this movement near him had reached out and brought him back to the ship , turned his head and looked at Orlop . These two thoroughly ordinary men stared at each other for a second , glanced back out into the immensity , looked at each other again , and smiled . Remembering the perspiration that had clung about his face as he ate at the table , Orlop lifted the back of his hand to his forehead . His forehead felt dry and pleasant . The two men moved nearer to each other along the rail . " Damn fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , " said Hemple , taking in deeper breaths as if to savour the breeze to which he referred . " It 's going to be a fine night for sleeping , " said Orlop . " I wish it was time to put the cots down , " said Hemple . This wish seemed to have pervaded the ship . It was as if it were a part of the slight , steady breeze that just barely was  | fragrant of the distant islands across which it was passing . Men appeared only to be killing time until they could turn in for the night . Cruck stomped in a very leisurely manner about the deck fumbling with little details here and there , tidying up , much as if a persistent storm had denied to him , up until these tranquil moments , the opportunity for this business . Others sat about in the forecastle , with the breeze blowing in through the open port-holes , sewing , reading or playing cards . Ensign Snell stepped through the After Conning-tower entrance onto the quarter-deck . He stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavily about . He looked at the victrola , then at the coffin sleeping in sombre self-possession on the cot . A flicker of something indefinite but alert travelled through him . Then he relapsed , as by an act of will , into his peaceful , unseeing gazing about ... at the wake .. . at the torpedo-tube . . . forward , past the conning-tower , along the deck . His gaze was held by the distant bulk of the forecastle , alive with patches of electric light . He strolled forward . On going as far in that direction as the engine-room hatches he encountered a robust murmur of talk and laughter that drifted down in careless bursts from somewhere up on the forecastle . He climbed the ladder to that deck and came upon Arnold overhauling signal flags , the rack for which was at the brink of the forecastle . It was almost dark now and Arnold was working in the rectangle of light cast from the open door of the radio shack , before which several men were squatting , talking with him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty at his instrument , sitting there with his head , phones askew so that one ear was free to listen to the conversation of his friends . They all stood up as Ensign Snell paused . " Sit down , for Christ 's sake , " muttered the officer with what an alien in the ship might have taken for an abashed manner . He took out a Fatima and lit it behind his cupped hands . The men kept their faces turned to him , grinning respectfully in complete , sympathetic friendliness . " Why do n't you go aft and get the victrola ? " asked the officer at the end of a considerable silence . Ragatzo and one of the Carey brothers jumped to their feet  | in precipitate acceptance of the offer . They were already going down the ladder before the exclamatory murmur of surprise and pleasure had run its course amidst the group of men . Halfway down the deck , Ragatzo said to Carey : " He 's a swell guy . " " He 's the whitest son of a bitch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Conning-tower , they came to a dead stop , shoulder to shoulder , as if they had collided with a soft but repulsing barrier in the darkness that had finally settled upon the sea and the throbbing ship . Their eyes were fixed on the coffin . Then slowly , on tip toe , they moved up to the victrola and unlashed it . Ragatzo carried it forward . Carey pulled two handfuls of records from the chest and hurried after him . As Ragatzo went up the forecastle ladder with the victrola , Hardwood , scrubbing clothes beneath the electric light bulb in the washing space , hooted after him : " You all look like you seen a ghost . " " Crazy bastard ! " Ragatzo muttered fiercely under his breath . He placed the victrola on top of the signal flag rack and indiscriminately selected the top record of the pile that Carey laid on the deck . There was no awning over this section of the ship , and the breeze , suddenly shifting for an instant in a strong puff from aft , swirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder in Hardwood 's shouted gibe at Ragatzo , a cloud of acrid fumes and cinders from the nearby funnel . Even after the breeze had shifted to its former direction they kept hawking and spitting as if they could not get the stench out of their throats and nostrils . Ragatzo blew the cinders off the disc and set it playing . Ensign Snell leant against the side of the Radio Shack , Portness resumed his seat before the instrument and those who had been squatting on the deck relaxed there again . Up on the bridge , where he was standing the Eight-to-Midnight Quartermaster Watch , Warrington was leaning , motionless and waiting , against the wind-breaker . He felt himself to be a victim of some peculiar quality in the deepening night , attributing to it his poignant restlessness . The breeze , warm , caressing , delicately scented , did not calm him . It seemed ,  | rather , to combine with the living , reciprocative swaying of the ship in preparing his being for the disturbance that possessed it . He felt as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resisting the necessity to plunge up through it for relief , wildly up through it past the stars that cascaded in arrested torrents toward the soft , metallic line of the horizon . Like dense , black velvet the sea smoothed away in every direction from the phosphorescent swath Delilah was cutting through it , parting in two even billows of flickering green flame before the knife of her bow , flashing along her sides , trailing back into the infinity of her wake , a contrast , cold , alluring and unearthly , to the red glow above the smokestacks . It gave Warrington satisfaction to glance back now and then at this glow above the smokestacks , this glow of a fire that could consume and burn through even the smothering beauty of the night ; but it did not steady the unevenness of his breathing nor quiet the torment of his waiting . . . waiting ... that was what this desperate feeling was . . . a kind of waiting , not with the expectancy of the something splendid in the far future , but disturbingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something just as unidentifiable , yet something that also was climactic , fulfilling . The melody from the victrola below , as if the restless night itself had summoned it , rose to colour and define his torment . He said to himself : " They must have borrowed the victrola from aft . . . that 's that Song Without Words . . . What 's the matter with me anyhow . . . with him ? " He knew that Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , across the bridge there , was as restless as he in this moment ; yet here they were together , his cherished friend and he . . . with everything as it always had been in their best watches together . . . talking until there had seemed nothing more to say . . . He made a frantic gesture of impatience that was almost completely internal . . . but he continued to stand there waiting . . . waiting . . . And nothing sustained occurred to divert them , to help them , no slightest business of sighting a ship or a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corned-beef sandwiches , set down near the Forward Fire-room Hatch to fortify the oncoming watch , aroused them to prepare for their reliefs . They simply  | had stood there silently on the bridge of this thin , dark ship swaying through the perfumed night with a corpse on the quarter-deck , stood there , desperate with imminence , staring ahead into the deep sky at strange , low stars , bright , implacable and pure . 3 When Delilah steamed past Corregidor Island into Manila Bay , tied up alongside the dock at the Cavite Naval Base and discharged the coffin , a few naval people remarked casually , " I see Delilah came in today . " Once or twice somebody troubled to make negligent answer to the effect that , " Yes , she 's been down south after the body of an Army Officer . " Delilah , however , in her own view had steamed triumphantly into harbour , surrounded by the aura of a dauntless victory over wounds and ordeal . Her men , when they went ashore on their first liberty , assumed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in a dangerous and exacting crisis . They had unconsciously settled into an emotional arrangement on sighting Corregidor that somehow , as far as it concerned the outside world , was based on the assumption that that outside world knew and felt as much about their long expedition south as they did . They actually would not have been surprised if they had been called upon to parade through streets lined with people cheering approval and admiration : But most of the people they met did not even know that their ship had been south . This vacuum in the attitude of these people where Delilah 's men , without saying so or thinking about it , had expected a positive plenty , made them vaguely indignant : And the people whom they encountered were irritated , on their part , by this inexplicable quality that tinctured the destroyer 's crew . The crew was like a college football player who , falling into the idea that he was in a vital game , had run seventy miraculous yards with a broken rib , only to find , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the stands contained not a single person .  | A few , such as Cruck , Ferguson and Saunders , found it particularly difficult to adjust their expectancy to what it met , and finally , although they would have been outraged if this had been explained to them , attempted to satisfy this expectancy with public attention earned by new and irrelevant feats . Ashore together on the afternoon of the first liberty party , Cruck , Ferguson and Saunders seemed to sense something disregarding and inhospitable in Cavite 's principal street as they strolled along with its trickle of natives , Chinamen , Navy people and dowdy American civilians ; and almost as if seeking shelter from this strange bleakness of the angular , sun-baked thoroughfare , the usual mercantile street of little sea ports bequeathed by the Spaniards to tropical countries , they turned into the dusk of a drinking place . They stood for a moment , almost posing , just within the doorway . No one in the crowd there noticed them except an acquaintance of Cruck 's , a Machinist 's Mate off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of beer on his table . Cruck , speaking loudly to the whole room , but ostensibly addressing Saunders and Ferguson , said something that involved the word , " Delilah , " raising and strengthening his enunciation as he pronounced the word . This begot no attention from the crowd in the drinking place . Saunders then replied to him , also using the name , " Delilah , " talking in a mumbling manner until he reached the word , which he shouted clearly and distinctly . Not a head turned . For a moment the three stared hard into the long , low-ceilinged room filled with the thin murk of unventilated tobacco smoke , then they swaggered to a table against the middle of the left wall and sat down , talking loudly . They ordered beer . The empty moments before the arrival of the drinks became intolerable in this place that for them was proving as perverse and unsatisfactory as the street . Saunders ' gaze , scouting belligerently here and there , caught and held that of a man at the next table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sailor ? " " Brooklyn , " was the reply . " What ship you off of ? " " Delilah ! "  | " That 's the new transport , ai n't it ? " " What the hell navy do you come from ? " jeered Cruck angrily . The tone in which he said this nettled a big Coxswain with the other party . He replied carelessly for his friend : " What the hell of it ? " Cruck 's glare appraised the six or seven men sitting with the big man ; then slowly he seemed to dismiss them , and looked down at the glass of beer being set before him . A little beer had slopped over the edge of the glass and formed a puddle about as large as a dollar on the table . Impatiently he flicked at the little puddle with his forefinger . His whole hand got involved with liquid in this gesture . Without thinking he put his wet hand down and gave it a drying stroke across the leg of his white trousers . Such dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved in the beer , wiped off in a long , dark streak on his trouser leg . Looking down and observing this , Cruck put his clenched , uncomfortable hand back upon the table . His coarse nostrils sniffed at the air about him . It was malodorous with that stench peculiar to superficially cleaned bar-rooms in the Orient , of warm matting and stale urine , of Manila tobacco smoke and spilled drink slopped over with crude soap . For Cruck , this always had been a kind of homely fragrance ; but now a mysterious feeling of being ridiculous surged through him and brought him to his feet , saying with some fury : " This place stinks ! " " Aw , sit down , " yelled someone from the other side of the room , " you 're rockin ' the boat ! " A blinding , scorching short-circuit seemed to explode somewhere in the middle of Cruck 's body . At one and the same time he was here in this hostile bar-room and back in that boat in the cave being tricked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of an animal-like , lunging trot , he was behind the big man at the next table who had said , " What the hell of it ? " He took a firm grip on the man 's black neckerchief with his left hand and swung him around . As the man 's face came about , Cruck drove his right fist straight into the centre of it . The man fell to the floor on his back , his knees bent upward  | like a stricken insect 's . The Coxswain 's friends stood up and stared down at his face masked by the blood which also was drenching the front of his white jumper . His legs slowly unflexed and straightened out along the damp gritty boards . Then they tried to get at Cruck . He upset their table in front of them . One tripped on a leg of the overturned table and sprawled over it . Saunders , who was now on his feet , kicked him in the throat . People at tables nearby got hastily to their feet and crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while those at a distance stood on chairs to see . Ferguson promptly had lunged from his chair to Cruck 's side , but he no sooner had arrived there than he had been dropped to his knees by a blow from a man who hurdled the overturned table . In groggy instinctiveness , Ferguson clutched at the flaring ends of the white trouser legs about the ankles planted before him . He jerked them fiercely upward and toward him as he rose again to his feet . The man crashed to the floor in a sitting posture . Ferguson stepped quickly across him , kneeing him accurately on the jaw in the stride of his step . A thin noise was coming through Cruck 's teeth as he clung and twisted with his left hand and slugged with his right . This noise was like a wild , steady scream pitched so high that it almost escaped the ear only to slash horribly at nerves buried deep in the body . A kick , then another , drove Cruck to the floor clutching a patch of ripped cloth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fists braced widely on either side of his body , his eyes staring frantically . A beer glass shattered explosively near his right shoulder . A man swung a chair and knocked him flat . Before the chair could land a second time , Saunders had its wielder in a strangle-hold . Cruck rolled his body away with a swift , violent movement , and kept rolling in this convulsive fashion between the tables until he brought up , as if he were a log crashing down a hillside , against the legs of the spectators crowded against the tables on the far side of the centre aisle . There he got to his feet and backed along the aisle to the door , where he stood , his uniform covered with dirt and blood , his knees giving spasmodically , staring semi-consciously in the direction of the fight . Ferguson , jabbing and hooking effectively as he backed away ,  | was himself half-way to the door when he saw Saunders , pressed against the wall near where they had been sitting , slide helplessly to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it projected above the V-neck of his white jumper and , as he pulled him up , pounded him in the face . The undershirt gave away . As the man reached down for another hold , Ferguson stopped backing towards the door and charged in again , head down , through the two slugging enemies in front of him . His hurtling , stocky body cleared a tumbled path and felled the man leaning over the disabled Saunders . Two men , one armed with a broken bottle , were making for Cruck , who still stood there unsteadily in the doorway ; but now they flung about and leaped for the charging Ferguson . Ferguson kicked at the face of the man he had knocked over , gripped Saunders by the beltline of his trousers and dragged him away along the wall toward the front of the place , upsetting tables behind him as he progressed . His eyes fixed desperately on the doorway as he dragged Saunders along , Ferguson began to shout , at regular intervals , wild , sustained cries of defiant need : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Delilah ! " This cry ascended from a dirty , remote drinking place , a summons from the cheap murk of a petty brawl ; but a brawl , nevertheless , in which Ferguson and his unconscious friend were facing much of what the individual has faced in many a decisive battle of the world . The shout , rising from his bloody lips with all the terrible lilt of cries heard above the frenzy of a Hastings or a Gettysburg , swept up and down the street outside , arrested the two Carey brothers , who just had left the ship , and pulled Orlop , the Chief Gunner 's Mate , out of a nearby restaurant onto the sidewalk . As if it took more than one pulse of the cry to launch them , each paused where he stood there in the street until the cry had rung again and again in their ears ; then the two Carey brothers , tall , slim , boisterous men from Tennessee who were viciously effective in a fight , began to run . Orlop , walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the drinking place as if they were crashing it in . Their furious ingress knocked Cruck to the floor and brought them , unseeing in the sudden  | change of light , deep into the interior and up against the crowd trying to keep clear of the fight . The Careys struck out blindly against the bodies in contact with them . . . " Delilah ! . . . Delilah ! " . . . It was behind them there on the other side of the room ! They swung around and leapt toward it , one after the other , like a man and his vivid shadow in a turmoil of obscurity and danger . Now they could make out the struggle against the wall , a crowded tangle of quick , vicious movement . Cruck 's head had cracked hard on the base of the cashier 's cage when the Careys had knocked him down . Almost reflexively now , he pulled himself up once more by clawing at the door jamb . He leant there helplessly , just barely able to raise his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of those whom the Carey brothers had struck in the first blind moment of their entrance , jumped at him with swinging fists . As the man 's first blow landed , Orlop appeared in the doorway . With movements that seemed somehow leisurely and authoritative in all that frantic cruelty and panic , Orlop pulled the man off Cruck , backed him against the opposite door jamb , measured him there for an instant and then hit him accurately on the point of the jaw . This blow , struck so efficiently , so deliberately , and illuminated as if by a spotlight in the rectangular beam of afternoon sunshine that cut the murk just inside the doorway , seemed to concentrate , for the beholders , the deadly , blood-spattering reality of the violence around them . There ran through the crowd trying to keep clear of the fight a murmur of gathering shock that broke here and there into revolted exclamation , into sadistic cheering ; then a girl began to scream , the thin , high , chattering scream of a Malay woman in bewilderment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darted through the door , paused outside for an instant to look wildly up and down the street for the Marine Patrol , and then started running as if goaded by a savage gust of the mad sounds behind him . Other battle cries arose now , cries as enraged and pleading as the " Delilahs ! " that had summoned Orlop and the Carey brothers . " Brooklyn ! " . . . " Brooklyn ! " . . . " Submarines ! " . " Monadnock ! " . . . " Monadnock ! "  | A rapidly increasing crowd had gathered in the street . Struggling vainly to see inside , some pressed close up to the doorway . Others , forced to rely only on their ears , massed before the huge screen of matting that served virtually as the front wall of the semi-open place . They had winced back when the woman 's scream issued from behind this matting , back still further before the catastrophic sound of an unseen crash that involved glass . From the dark chaos in there hidden by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with agony , staggered out into the sunny air of the street : " O-o-o ! ... O-o-o ! ... My God ! ... n-n-n ! ... n-n-n ! .. . n-n-n ! ... " A barefooted , stocky Tagalog , his sun-blackened face twisted into a truculent mask , leaped forward from the crowd on the sidewalk , reached in and fumbled for a grip on the matting . He gave a fierce jerk . The screen gave a little . He gripped the edge of it with both hands and threw his body back with all his might . The great area of thick matting came completely away with the suddenness of a storm-ripped sail . The white glare of the sunlight exploded into the smoky dusk of the embattled room as if someone had set off in there a monstrous flashlight cartridge . All motion was arrested instantly , paralysed by the mighty impact of the light . The back of the room seemed to have flashed forward , and the shallow place , cluttered with dirt and blood and rigid , distorted figures , erect or fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to the sun , tawdry , livid , unreal . " The Patrol ! . . . Patrol ! " somebody shouted . Delilah 's men hurled themselves out into the street . Before them the crowd out there surged away as from a burst of maniacal danger . The six of them , clawing at each other in frenzied cohesion , clustered briefly on the sidewalk , glaring wildly up and down the sunny ambush between the two rows of shabby , exotic buildings . A Marine Patrol was double-timing up the street from the water-front ; another was just rounding a corner in the opposite direction . " In there , " panted Ferguson . Dragging the almost helpless Saunders with them , they  | charged from the street into a narrow dry-goods shop . The Chinaman behind the counter closed his eyes at sight of them and dropped to the floor . They brought up , staggering with the inertia of their charge , against the back wall of the store , where their collective breathing sounded like some unnatural boiling in the cool , cloth-scented gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door belligerently . Cruck and Saunders , drunk with blows , swayed against the counter , holding on to one another 's arms . Saunders kept sniffing at the blood that blocked his nose . Orlop , his feet slightly spread , stood with bent head and mopped at his handsome , perspiring face with his handkerchief like a man who had been outraged but who also was disgusted because he had lost control of himself . Ferguson , the lips in his round , hard , full face tightly pressed together , was pawing and jabbing at the shadow of the back wall . He gave a tug and then a shove . A shaft of diffused daylight bluely tainted the right half of his body . " Let 's go ! " he shouted , and they crowded after him out the rear door . 4 Back aboard ship the next morning with their wounds , they recounted to the rest of the crew what had happened , recounted it in a manner that very definitely crystallized in many a feeling that there really was something wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere passion of victims of injustice they told a tale of having been generally slighted , of having been put upon verbally and of finally having been mobbed . That Chief Gunner 's Mate Orlop had been with them in the trouble lent to their view of it a respectable colour and a strong support . They could think of no other explanation for this persecution save that the other ships and the Base were jealously resentful . " Them sons of bitches , " said Cruck , " are sore because we showed ' em up . While we was out doin ' somethin ' they was layin ' around on them God damn fake submarines and tin cruisers . . . But we showed ' em ! "  | Through the Base and in the other ships , news of the fight had spread quickly because it had been a more fierce and bloody affair than usual . The news was ribbed with indignation because none of Delilah 's men , who had started the thing , had been apprehended by the Patrol ; whereas others who merely had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under arrest . The consensus was that Delilah 's men now , for some reason , thought they were " salty " and were looking for trouble . They were , seemed to be the general determination , going to get plenty of it . Within two days there were two more such fights ; one of mob proportions in the big dance hall at Caloocan , into which even Wembly , the First Class Gunner 's Mate , sober , placative , sensitive of his broken nose , had been drawn . The opinion , agitatingly sponsored by Cruck , Saunders and Ferguson , grew rapidly now amongst Delilah 's men that what many had believed from the first was true , that they were deliberately being resented and bullied ; and when , a night later , there was a wild melee at the very gate of the Base in which Poe was hit with a bottle , Warrington received a cut over the eye and Hemple had his jumper ripped off , the most stable men aboard admitted " that there must be something to it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers and taken them to the hospital . Their injuries were such that they were kept there . Delilah 's crew , almost to a man , now had lost its perspective . Men who habitually suffered a taint of cynicism in estimating the quality of such life as touched them saw in this petty , incidental violence an affront to some fundamental significance . A kind of red irritation swept many of them when they thought of the Carey brothers lying in the hospital . They suffered this even in the face of knowing that also in the hospital were seven men from the ranks of those whom they had come to look upon as their enemies : three Marines , one Tagalog civilian , two men from the submarines and a man from the Brooklyn . Most of them now , including Cord , the Boilermaker , stood ready to answer with their embattled presences whenever there should arise , from the depths of even the tawdriest brawl , the summons to defence .  | Actually feeling themselves to be a small tribe of unsubmitting men isolated amidst persecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore . They organized into little fighting parties of from six to eight men and pledged themselves to remain within these groups while on liberty . By a process of natural selection the units that would run the chance of meeting the most active violence contained the most pugnacious and experienced fighters ; thus , from the ranks of those who wanted to spend their time in saloons and brothels were formed units that contained such men as Cruck , Saunders , Ragatzo , Ferguson , Whorley and Rene ; while those who wanted to go to the restaurants , the shops and the picture-show drew men like Orlop , Feenan , Petrie , Cord , Portness , Warrington , Poe and Barnes , the Blacksmith . Warrington really did not want to go at all . The kind of meaningless brutality he was being called upon to face ashore revolted and intimidated him , made him feel cheaply helpless ; but in the sensation , bordering on nervous nausea , that gripped him as the time drew near he detected fear , so he forced himself to go , forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment , in the zeal of this self-discipline , he even contemplated going to the saloons and the brothels with those who were sure to be set upon . There was one group of men who did not know where they wanted to go , who insisted that they " just wanted to bum around . " Of these were O'Connel , Morrow , Forsythe , Arnold , Hardwood , a wild , formidable fighter , and Horner . " Unc " Blood scornfully refused to remain even in the vicinity of any group and prepared , as usual , to disappear from sight and knowledge until the time for his reporting back to the ship . When two bells struck , the whole number of those who were going on liberty lined up in two rows along the port railing to be checked out in a body by the Quartermaster on watch . On larger ships this invariably was the custom , those having liberty being permitted to leave the ship only at scheduled times , and only after having been inspected by the Officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchored where bumboats were plentiful , a man left whenever he had a mind to after the  | first liberty party was called away , and the Quartermaster on watch did the inspecting . For this reason the sight of the two long lines of spotless white uniforms astonished Ensign Snell , the Officer of the Deck , as he took the first paces of a casual stroll from the quarter-deck to the bridge . The surprised look on his face slowly gave way to one of naive curiosity . His lips breaking into his heavy smile and his throat rumbling faintly with the beginnings of his laugh , he took the few steps necessary to bring him beside the Quartermaster , who was about to begin the inspection . At his appearance , the Quartermaster stood at attention . The two long lines of sunburned men , clean and smelling of soap , also stiffened to attention . Ensign Snell glanced up and down the ranks , then at the Quartermaster . The pleasant flood of his smile and the words of his short question seemed to come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of minor pleasure , wonderment and excitement : " What 's the idea ? " " It 's the liberty party , Sir , " answered Cavendish , the Quartermaster on watch . Ensign Snell looked away up the length of the deck and back as if he might have been trying to convince himself that he really was here beside Delilah 's midships torpedo-tube , that these really were her small engine-room hatches projecting from the bare steel of her deck , that he was not amidst the bright , clean order of some large and formal cruiser . Cavendish , as if assisting him at this effort , volunteered , when the officer 's eyes came back to his : " They just all happened to come aft at the same time , Sir . " Ensign Snell , under the influence of the impression engendered by this unusual sight of the men lined up there in regulation fashion to go ashore , fell into the prescribed routine with which an Officer of the Deck on a large man-of-war dispatches a liberty party . As he moved along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tightly stretched awning , scrutinizing carefully the dress and appearance of each , he noticed a long bulge below the left side of Heller 's fashionably snug jumper . " What 's that ? " he asked the Pharmacist 's Mate .  | " That 's a shoe , Sir . I 'm taking it ashore to be fixed . " " Take it out and carry it , " said the officer . " That 's no way to go ashore . " Heller stood there without moving . " Take it out . " Heller , with calm helplessness , lifted his jumper to display a length of iron pipe sticking above the waistline of his trousers . A hole had been drilled near one end of the pipe . A shoe-lace was looped through the hole . Heller pulled out this deadly weapon and tossed it on the deck . The officer stared down at the thing for many seconds as if he were giving his slow , goodnatured thoughts time to run their course . When he finally looked up he was hard , clanging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any more of you got these things ? " No movement or word flickered from the two long lines of faces , which remained monotonous in their simple range from stubborness to grimness . " Quartermaster , search these men . " Cavendish 's eyes darted nervously from end to end of the front line of men , his face expressing clearly his loathness to obey the order . At the climax of this brief hesitation , he moved to the end of the line and planted himself in front of Wembly . The two stared at each other for a moment ; then Wembly , puncturing the tension of ignominy , reached beneath his jumper , produced a home-made brass-knuckles and , with a gesture of aroused independence rather than recklessness , heaved it on the deck close to Heller 's primitive blackjack . All . down the deck men now emulated this gesture , until Ensign Snell found himself staring down at a sizeable heap of metal and wood that seemed fairly to shimmer with a threatening and sinister emanation . Still staring at the heap of weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he can step up here . " In exactly this position , the officer looking with a kind of impersonal harshness down at the heap , the men staring straight  | ahead with an expression that closely resembled the quality of Wembly 's gesture in producing the brass-knuckles , they waited for the appearance of the Captain . Followed by Cavendish , the Captain came around the galley and paused at sight of the extraordinary tableau . He looked from the liberty party to the pile of weapons as if struggling fora preliminary estimation of what the scene meant ; then he walked to Ensign Snell , who had faced about and come to attention upon first hearing the two sets of footsteps approaching along the steel drum of the deck . " Yes , Mr. Snell ? " Ensign Snell 's posture relaxed slightly and he barely made a movement with his hand of indicating the lines of men . " This is the liberty party , Captain . " He said this as if it still were an astonishing thing . " They all had these gadgets stowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They all had them , hey ? " " All but a few of the Chief Petty Officers and O'Connel there , " replied Ensign Snell . Instantly , without thinking , O'Connel almost imperceptibly offered his two great , clenched fists in a displaying manner as if scorning the technicality that permitted him to escape the full charge of having joined his fellows in their arming . The Captain stooped and lifted several of the weapons one after another , delaying over each one , in this stooping posture , as if in careful inspection . When he straightened up , he turned to Cavendish : " Quartermaster , throw this stuff over the side . " As Cavendish gathered up an armful of the weapons and moved past the torpedo-tube towards the starboard rail , the Captain got hold of the leather case that held his spectacles , deliberately took them out and put them on . Looking impersonally , dispassionately at the men , although afterward each one of them retained the impression that he had looked straight at him part of the time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was addressing : " Suspend all liberty from the ship indefinitely . " As the men moved forward , on Ensign Snell 's order of dis-  | missal , the Captain stood staring after them for a fraction of a second , a moment that seemed much longer because of the quality he concentrated in it . He had been swept , as he stared after the men , with the same feeling of warning , with that impression like the recognition of a covenant , that had come to him every time he had called upon the poorly conditioned ship for some rigorous performance . To these men , too , these tested men who knew every eccentricity of her life , every weakness , every individualized strength , he somehow was inextricably committed . They seemed to him , as he stared after them , these particular men in relation to each other , an indispensable part of her that he must keep intact and operative if he was to get her in the condition upon which he had set his mind and spirit , set them so powerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be called nothing less than an obsession . This strength of his feeling as it applied to his crew had impressed Admiral Douglas in their conference that morning . The Admiral had summoned Delilah 's Commander ashore to his office and told him that everything he had requested for Delilah 's rehabilitation was granted , that the work was to begin immediately . Lieutenant-Commander Borden nearly had recoiled before this statement . He had been prepared to fight so strenuously for only half of what was on his list that this complete surrender , amounting in the light of the normal past almost to eagerness , had left him with a feeling of uneasiness . It was as if in getting what he wanted , he had gotten much more , something mysterious and dangerous yet unapparent ; but his frank pleasure had broken out all over him . His eyes sparkling and his wrinkled face smiling unrestrainedly , he had stood in the doorway of the shabby , frame room , shaded to an illusion of coolness behind lowered Venetian blinds , and shaken Admiral Douglas ' hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " And by the way , Borden , before we 're through with you , your crew as well as your ship will be brand new . We 're going to turn you out of here really shipshape . " At this , Lieutenant-Commander Borden had closed the door behind him and stepped back into the office . The man past whom he stepped held within the operation of his will and prejudices ,  | to a vital degree , the future of his career and his fate ; but he had stepped past him with all the defiance , all the preparation for struggle that he so long had been mustering to gain his ends regarding the repairs to his ship . Startled as he had been by the implication in Admiral Douglas ' casual statement and despite its heavy tug at his spirits , he had reassured himself that he was prepared . He had not expected the difficulty to take this form ; but it was , essentially , the same struggle and he had felt his commitment to it no less powerfully . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relaxed alertness . He seemed more like a person who had heard something rather than one expecting to hear something ; and the impression he had given had been so fatefully that of a man over whom a victory would prove of a cost out of all proportion to its worth , that Admiral Douglas had been surprised and a little flurried . His speech slowly regaining authority and fluency in the face of his subordinate 's deathlike barrier of nonacceptance , he positively had argued his point before Lieutenant-Commander Borden had said as much as a word . " Delilah 's crew , " he had contended , " has gone sour . As everybody knows , this sometimes happens . . . And the only thing to do in such cases is to break the crew up . These fights all over the place have upset the whole establishment . . . and even the civilians are complaining . This is the thing to do and it 's been arranged . Why ! A number of people already are laid-up in the hospital . It will do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To all this , Lieutenant-Commander Borden had answered simply that he did not agree with the idea . A flick of irritation had cut through Admiral Douglas ' sensibilities . Up to this moment he always had liked Borden . He never had seen him like this before in all the years the man had been in and out of his life officially and unofficially . He would put an end to it . He would tell him that this was what he had decided and that this was the way it was going to be . The Admiral was tall and thin and his curly hair and mustaches were white . He had leaned aggressively over Borden to tell him just this ; but he had found  | himself arguing in the same fashion once more when the words came out . He even had found himself tolerantly trying to talk down to Borden as one would to an unreasonable being . This had plunged their conference still deeper into failure , for Borden was not an unreasonable man . Anybody in the Navy would have been surprised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt , no matter whose it was , that in some way there was something wrong with the opinion . Always he gave the impression of being calm , subordinate , co-operative , and he had given that impression even then , as he had stood there , a mature man with eyelids slightly lowered behind the lenses of his horn-rimmed spectacles , repeating over and over , in different form each time an answer was required of him , that his crew was fitted and trained for its duties to an efficiency that would be hard for him to duplicate . . . that it had not gone " sour " .. . that he understood and could handle the situation satisfactorily ... that he requested permission to do this . . . that he " personally " requested the responsibility . Admiral Douglas , irritated though he had been , had shied away from this " personal " element in the situation ; yet lie had felt that somehow this was a very personal matter to Borden , a vitally personal one , and there had grown in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had grown less certain of as the conversation had progressed ) by overriding so much personal issue in a man of such unquestionable , such impressive integrity . In the end , it had been decided that the crew should be held together ; but that while the ship was going through its extensive repair period two of the officers and a number of the men should be detached temporarily for duty elsewhere in the seriously undermanned Asiatic Squadron . Delilah 's Commanding Officer had had to be satisfied with this . For him , it had held off the dissolution of his crew as an accomplished fact , and it had given his determination , his unmitigated and active determination , something to go on . He knew , however , how this arrangement would work . When the time came , simply to save themselves trouble , the Personnel Office would try to give him new men who happened to be near at hand : But he would handle that somehow ,  | he told himself . He brought to this promise the same kind of adamantine resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but his very existence seemed to be disorganizing and scattering to the four winds as he thought of his officers leaving for other commands . . . of little groups of his men , their packed bags and hammocks on their shoulders , turning their backs on the dismantled ship and tramping away .. " temporarily , " he said loudly in his mind as if the word had some exorcising quality . . . But he would get them all back .. . even the two in the hospital ... just as he would get the ship back together after they finished tearing her apart . He would reject any new men they tried to foist on him . He did not know just how he would find the way to do this ; but he would .. . And he would get all his men back ... every last one of them I 5 On that first evening when Delilah had steamed up from the south and sought out the dock in Cavite alongside which she was to remain for repairs , the men simply had tied her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their supper and turned in for a night of sleep free of uncertainty and vigilance . The next morning , however , they had gotten up to look about them with a feeling of being landlocked in the midst of the surrounding scene yet definitely insulated from it . Their voyage south seemed to have unfocused their sense of time so that they instinctively had looked for signs of the changes that must have taken place since last they were here ; and , as if striving to detect with their nostrils the signs that escaped their eyes , they sniffed at the air about them , repeatedly unconvinced by the accustomed aroma , bold and becalmed , that pervades places where many ships seek shelter and repair . Here was the dock , which they knew well , a long repair quay quite out of the traffic of the Yard . They often had tied up to it before ; yet as far as they could see its every detail remained unchanged . There across the narrow stretch of ( lead water was the Submarine Dock . Close in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a relic that had spread its sails in the War Between the States ; and on every  | hand , confining Delilah as if she were a slightly hysterical invalid , were the sprawling sheds , temporary , with corrugated iron roofs , and the old Spanish buildings , one story and of stone , that housed the Base 's machine shops , foundries , laboratories , storehouses , magazines , offices and barracks : all unaccountably unchanged , as if this place , drugged with heavy sunshine , had dreamed away in suspended animation the formidable lapse of time through which they themselves had returned . It was days before this feeling of their environment being strangely the same had readjusted itself or become dissolved in their turbulence over the change they had managed to find in the people ashore . Struggling in this unworded mood with the scene that imprisoned their ship , the men had had then no slightest suspicion that many of them were to be dispersed into and even beyond this stagnant-seeming outside world , nor that its inhabitants were about to begin on Delilah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophecy . Still in this mood on the third morning , many of the crew had gathered after breakfast along the starboard rail to smoke through a traditional moment of idleness before beginning the day 's work . They were staring in calm curiosity across the muddy channel at the submarines . Three of the submarines , moored flank to flank , projected from the dock , while a fourth was hauled up on a small ways such as might be used in caulking and painting a comfortably sized sail-boat . Delilah 's men all had seen submarines before and a few had served in them , and often they had seen the conning-towers of these very boats bobbing loggily about Manila Bay or drifting uncertainly close in along the coast between Corregidor and Olongapo ; but none of the men had ever seen one of these A-Boats out of the water before . It was hard for them to believe that the primitive craft on the ways there actually was a vessel in the United States Navy ; and they stared at the thick , blunt , grey egg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , although they had seen street-cars every day of their lives , were confronted for the first time with a horse-car that had clung on to use in some backward corner of the world . If O'Connel had had any idea that  | in a few days he would be serving in that awkward lump on the ways over there , he never would have exclaimed loudly : " That damn thing is so old it 's about to fall apart ! " Instead he would belligerently have said , despite the fact that these first submarines of the modern Navy were many years old : " Aw , they 're all right . Still kickin ' right along . " At what he did say , Mendel , standing within three feet of him , flinched spasmodically as if O'Connel had made one of the old gestures of aggression towards him ; and the Jew continued to stare at the small , aged death-trap as if he had some prescience that soon he , himself , was to be serving in one of the things . From where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclamation had carried clearly the short distance back to the quarter-deck , where Lieutenant Fitzpatrick also was looking across at the submarine on the ways . The Irishman 's voice , brash and obtrusive , shot out of the general murmur along the rail like something that , taken by itself , was offensive and to be suppressed ; but Lieutenant Fitzpatrick required only a few seconds to rid himself of this impression , only as long as it took him to connect the voice with his established vision of the Irishman . Against the background of this vision the voice became quite another thing : it became a roaring emanation of risible wildness , of rough and ready glamour , of terrible but sympathetic valour . As if the better to establish this connection , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick leant out over the railing and looked forward to where the voice had risen . . . there he was . . . the crazy Irishman . . . what a lot of gold there was in that big loud mouth . . . the Jew on one side of him and Warrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzpatrick 's face slowly relaxed as he noted this . That , he told himself , was a queer combination . . . unhealthy . . . and now that he came to think of it , he had seen it often these last few days . His eyes shifted from Mendel 's dark repellent features to those of O'Connel . He knew what those Irish features meant , knew with his blood and the deepest nerves in his body . Then his eyes went to Warrington , and as he took in the blend of the boy 's curly blond hair , the firm , pure sculpture of his face and the utterly youthful tension in the curve of his body , he could not restrain his irritation .. .  | " Out of the whole damn crew these are the two Warrington picks ! . . . What the devil is the use in trying to help him anyway ? ... Anybody would think he was tied to O'Connel 's apron strings . . . That was what he probably liked really . . . that greasy Kike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin conviction that Admiral Douglas was right ... " the crew needed breaking up . . . a change all around would be a good thing " .. . At this instant Warrington turned his head aft and , observing the officer leaning far out over the rail staring in their direction with an emphatically disapproving expression on his face , concluded that it was a sort of order to O'Connel to pipe down . He quickly communicated this impression to O'Connel , speaking warningly almost out of the side of his mouth . O'Connel flashed a look in the officer 's direction . Then Lieutenant Fitzpatrick saw him smile recklessly down at Warrington , a smile of reassurance , appreciative affection and defiance . A sudden , astonished shout from the port side of the ship interrupted O'Connel 's smile and swung all eyes from the submarine to the general direction of the dock . Down it was pouring a mass of native humanity , heading for the ship like some plague of small , exotic animals that had sighted a carcass to be picked . There ensued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it occurred to anybody , and in which the attitude of the crew instinctively became that of men tensing to repel boarders ; but the tools on the shoulders and in the hands of the little Malays transferred , rather than dispelled , the astonishment , transferred it to the realm of the proper explanation . This horde was coming to work on Delilah ! It seemed to O'Connel that never before had he seen so many Navy Yard workmen at one time , not even at five o'clock leaving the gate . It seemed incredible that so many men and tools were coming to belabour one small ship . " Jesus ! " he shouted , " they must be going to do plenty to her . . . and in a hurry . " The crowd of workmen swarmed all over her , jostling and isolating her men as a herd of stampeding cattle engulfs a group of riders . In the first moments of this ferment , O'Connel  | was exasperated to the act of striking a native workman in the face with a shoving blow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the Forward Conning-tower by Rene and Warrington , where , to escape identification by the natives , he smouldered in hiding for almost an hour . To the consternation of the crew , who instantly had formed a conspiracy to shield him , he kept sticking his great head out of the door to emit general imprecations and exclamations to the effect that " all this means something . " However , by virtue of the fact that the Radio Shack screened the door to the Forward Conning-tower , O'Connel managed to remain undiscovered by the affronted man and his friends , to whom the Executive Officer had promised justice if they could point out the culprit . Ensign Snell had observed O'Connel being rushed into hiding and had concluded that he was the guilty party ; but all through the excited complaints that the blow gave rise to , he said nothing . It seemed to him useless to disclose the man , just about as useless as the blow had been , like an incident of opposition that loses its very meaning before some irresistible march of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Connel more or less secure from assignment to a Summary Court Martial , the workmen , armed with oxy-acetylene torches , cold chisels , saws and sledge-hammers , set upon Delilah and ripped off the plates of her deck . They tore her boilers out of her and flung them , a twisted mass of discarded intestines , on the dock . They hauled out the three cylinders and dumped them beside the boilers . They dismembered her so relentlessly , in fact , that even by lunch time she seemed to be a ship that was ceasing to live save with the repellent abstraction of life that a swathed figure manifests on a surgeon 's table . To O'Connel , everything they did to her appeared in the light of mysterious and frantic preparation . He was sure that j'all this means something , " and he loudly voiced this conviction every time the full power of it swept through him just as he had voiced it in the first moments of the workmen 's descent . For the speculative function of the rest of the crew , sensitively overalert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality in O'Connel 's exclamations was like a spark in a charged cylinder .  | It drove the feelings of the men to a near turmoil of curiosity and foreboding . Anyone who tried to maintain that this impressive rush of workmen meant merely a normal repair procedure was passed by derisively . Arnold wondered if it meant that the United States was going to join the war against Germany ; but that explanation was unsatisfactory , as far as Delilah was concerned , because there were no Germans out here to fight . The last of them had gone years before with the valorous Emden and the raiders . Finally , they tried to be content with a guess at a new Japanese threat ; but this neither satisfied nor settled them . Much of what O'Connel 's exclamations had aroused in the men , had already been aroused in the officers by the attitude that Ensign Woodbridge instantly had assumed when the Captain had returned from his conference with Admiral Douglas and told them that Delilah was to get every single one of the repairs requested and more besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly irritating , had resulted in no light on the event , not even as much as a reflection from the Captain ; but it had agitated Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Ensign Snell to the point where their minds and feelings continually reverted to restless conjecture . The Captain could not be drawn into this conjecturing ; and when they had enveloped him with the pressure of it , he had simply put on his glasses and told them , as if they had not been pressing him for something quite different , about Admiral Douglas ' intention to break up the ship 's company . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had offered , as a probable explanation , that inasmuch as England was finding it necessary to call home to the war nearly all of her naval forces , America was preparing to take over entirely the International Patrol of the Chinese Coast . This suggestion had satisfied no one , especially not Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , himself , who , as Second in Command , thought that the Captain should rightfully share with him even the most guarded secret that concerned the ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain did have a secret , and they felt that by refusing absolutely even to recognize their conjecturing he was withholding the just hint , the generous gleam from the satisfying light he must be  | hoarding within his dry , neat person , that would have enabled them to make proper deduction . It had not minimized the slight strain arising between the Captain and his officers over this situation when Ensign Woodbridge had smiled in an amused and dismissing manner at Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's suggestion about the International Patrol . He had behaved as if he were sure just what the remarkable repair concession meant , as if he had some definite information , as if the Captain , perhaps , had taken him into his confidence . This slightly had nettled the Captain , himself ; for he had no secret . He merely had a conjecture like the rest , a conjecture with which he felt he had no business to disturb them . What really had nettled him more than anything else was the suspicion that Ensign Woodbridge , as so often happened , had guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his young officer accepted as valid what he had guessed , lent , even as it annoyed him , a confirming weight to the Captain 's guarded conjecture that the Captain , himself , had not given it in the first place . Ensign Woodbridge could not be manoeuvred into sharing the item of his assurance . When Ensign Snell asked him pointblank what his opinion was , he had simply looked at the Captain and smiled . Then he had gotten up from the luncheon table as if he had been about to make some momentous preparations , asked the Captain for the key to the Signal Book locker and had gone aft with a portentous air into the Captain 's room . For a few seconds after he had disappeared , the Captain had sat looking from Lieutenant Fitzpatrick to Ensign Snell , seeking to find on their faces whether or not they were accusing him of countenancing in any way this absurd game . As if he had not liked what he had found in their faces , he too had arisen from the table . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in the Wardroom had heard him pacing slowly back and forth , the deliberate pulsations of his steps resounding on the thin plate above their heads like some function of the ship . Conflicting for their attention with the regular sounds of this pacing , yet supplementing it , had been the sounds Ensign Woodbridge made back there in the Captain 's room . He was in there spasmodically rattling papers , Signal Books ,  | charts and other such paraphernalia . Once he emitted a long , deliberative sigh . At this , Ensign Snell , looking as if he were about to rush in there and knock things about , had said aloud to himself in a vain effort to dismiss the whole matter from his mind : " Aw , hell , he does n't know any more about it than we do . " Of all the people in the ship who had caught the fever loosed by O'Connel 's exclamation forward and Ensign Woodbridge 's attitude aft , only two were sure : Ensign Woodbridge and Olgan , the Cook ; and the latter took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hidden beneath the general effect of his certitude . He simply stood silently , sullenly over his cookstove , succumbing to a growing terror and heaviness of heart that rose like symptoms from the nameless certainty deep within his ratlike being . 6 Under stimulation of the trouble ashore , the disorganization attendant upon the presence of the workmen and the restless pressure of foreboding and conjecture , the tension that had relaxed when Delilah turned her back on Palawan would have begun to gather again if the repair operation itself , which now was so largely responsible , had not involved its own antidote in the form of the partial dispersion of the crew and the dismantling of the ship . For some of the last of those transferred , it was a relief to escape the obligatory brawls ashore as well as the feeling of being left behind that ensued when the first batch of eight men were shipped away and Ensign Woodbridge was detached for some far-away duty up the Yangtse Kiang . Those of the men left behind soon found themselves forced to move from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation now having made uninhabitable every section of the vessel except the Captain 's room . Camped there alongside the ship with their cots and a cookstove , they spent a good deal of their time watching the efforts of the workmen . To some of the crew it seemed that the natives were unnecessarily violent in their work . A few even felt that  | they were taking it out on the ship for the blow O'Connel had struck ; and although no one put this impression into words , two or three of them actually watched carefully for the impact of a hammer or a spirt of the torches that would serve as a basis for protest . Strangely enough , the man most swayed by this idea was the taciturn and utterly practical Stengle , although he did not think of it , perhaps , in connection with the blow the workman had received . He was the first to observe something on which a protest could be based . He was standing on the dock looking down into the shallow , ragged cavity that had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove a long section of pipe . When one of the workmen lifted a sledge and struck the pipe several times in an effort to loosen the threads , Stengle emitted a loud exclamation of disgust , jumped aboard and hurried aft to where the Captain and Lieutenant Fitzpatrick were engaged in a discussion . Standing at his version of attention , Stengle told them that the workmen were ruining the whole pipe line system of the ship , that if something was not done at once the lines all would be crystallized from the sledge blows , that the rests and fittings where the lines passed through bulkheads would be worked out of fit and that he thought they were going about the whole dismantling procedure in the wrong manner . The Captain and Lieutenant Fitzpatrick stared at him in surprise . Coming from him this almost was an hysterical outburst . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick knew that Stengle 's statement was largely a dramatization of a shred of truth , the first such over-emphasis he ever had observed in the manifestations of this matter-of-fact man with whom he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching every detail of the dismantling , and he knew that as little harm was being done as was possible under the circumstances , that really things were going satisfactorily : Yet he too had gazed down in dissatisfaction at the work of the small , brown labourers . In the effort to restrain his own dissatisfaction , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had asked himself why , in the face of the acceptable work , he should have felt it , and there had passed through his mind , vaguely , rapidly , that what disturbed him was the dif-  | ferent philosophy of technique , or the lack of it , guiding these Malay workmen . These men from the jungles and thatchroofed villages knew imitatively about the machinery amidst which they worked , but they did not feel and believe it ; whereas he and most of his men , like their forefathers , were part of a nation that from the very beginning had sought the realization of its dreams through machines . In its homes , on its farms , in its cross-roads stores were machines . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the sea and its depths . Tales of machines passed in the stories from father to son , and its folk sang My Merry Oldsmobile , Steamboat Bill , Casey Josses and Hello Hawaii , How Are You ? Its poets had fodnd beauty in the precise flight of telegraph wires across the slay , and the senses of its people first awake to the singing , the odours and the symmetries of machines , just as the senses of these jungle men first awake to the sounds of birds , the perfumes of flowers and the patterns that grow from the earth . Confronted now by the authentic concern of the Chief Machinist 's Mate , this man in whose very cells was all evolved receptivity to the manner in which a pipe should be threaded or a throttle pulled , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick took it for granted that it was this cultural discrepancy that was stirring at the bottom of Stengle 's discomfort . He smiled at Stengle , and it was the strange quality in this smile that instantly informed Stengle of the unusual error into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was being what he called " soft . " His small , dark , mottled face seemed to heat to a dull red . The colour looked artificial beneath a smear of grease across his forehead . However , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said to him without a shade of difference from the tone he habitually used to him : " All right , Stengle , I 'll have another look right away . " Stengle swung about in a sagging fashion and got away as rapidly as possible from what he felt had become , somehow , an exhibition of himself . With an air of being in moral support of Stengle , the Captain stood there for a few seconds before he too turned and went below . He knew that Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was right , calm and right in a superior attitude , and he was thankful for it ; but he was on the side of Stengle in this  | matter , and if he had known how the men were standing on the dock suspecting the worst , he secretly would have wished , despite himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overt act . As he had tarried in Stengle 's wake he had been stubbornly grim . His wide lips pressed together in a firm line had given his face the expression of a grandparent who , hearing an obviously exaggerated tale of inefficiency at the hospital in which his grandchild is undergoing a treatment of which he disapproves , discounts the detail and silently but solemnly endorses the principle . An outsider observing the two in that moment might have gotten the impression that Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was the Captain and the other his officer . When the Chief Machinist 's Mate had interrupted them , the Captain and Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had been discussing the question of the Captain 's going ashore to live while the heavy repairs were in progress . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had suggested this once before , pointing out that the ship just would not be liveable ; and he had been urging it upon him again . " You can come on board every day , Sir , and look things over ... If anything comes up I 'll report to you at once .. . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the men ) ... Staying aboard here you 're just taking a beating for nothing . " The Captain , however , would not hear of it . He even , the better to resist his friend 's urging , maintained on the surface an air of listening to some sort of official report . He was , as a matter of fact , a little annoyed , because he suspected that behind and added to Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's concern in the matter was the instigation of his wife , who had insisted that he was wearing himself out uselessly sitting around all day in the noise and dirt . His sleeping aboard the dismantled thing , she thought , was utter nonsense , especially in view of the fact that previously he habitually had spent his nights ashore in their bungalow whenever Delilah was in the neighborhood of Manila . The Captain did not mind her going for him herself , personally , about this ; but he objected very definitely to her influencing or entering into relations with the business of the ship in any degree . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influence , always was quick ; for just beneath the surface of awareness was the suspicion that in some not clear way her influence on the life of the ship was considerable , and he was against this on principle . Every evening now at four-thirty , he would go ashore and join his wife , a tall , well-proportioned , blonde girl with a faintly freckled , shapely face that held an expression of calm frankness : But at midnight he would return to the demolished ship , and he would sleep there in her , the only person aboard this forlorn metal shell cluttered with tools , debris and oily dirt , as if any other course would have constituted a kind of abandonment . 7 Laura , the Captain 's wife , was the only woman any of the crew ever had seen aboard Delilah , and even her visits were rare . Nevertheless , the ship was populated by women , women who never had seen each other , women who slept and ate in houses often thousands of miles apart .. . a prosperous woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore in Brooklyn .. . a spare , barefooted woman slowly dying on a dank field in Alabama .. . a white-haired matron who chaperoned dances in Baltimore ... a woman who each day filled a dinner-pail in Akron . .. a woman in the Green Mountains ... a cloud of women , nostalgic , powerful , ever-present , that rested upon the ship as a cloud embraces a mountain top . They exchanged opinions , these women , whenever two men fell into a conversation about one of those subjects that men habitually delegate to the province of women : They criticized Olgan 's cooking ; they discussed marriage and how a home should be run ; a woman on the San Francisco water-front agreed , in essentials , with a woman in Cincinnati about Sarah Bernhardt . Another hummed , in the depths of the bunkers , a melody that she loved and which she often sang over her housework . One of them stood behind Ensign Snell at table and told him how to eat his soup . One placed a muffler around Petrie 's neck when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , a bedraggled woman on an Illinois farm , a man had made his last appeal when Delilah  | crushed him in an engine-room : " Mom , " he had whispered , " Mom . .. Mom . " It was no sensing of his wife 's being one of this pervading crowd of women that the Captain objected to . His objection was to an influence more material , more directly political : But his wife was amongst these women , powerfully amongst them . The men seemed to feel her there in his cabin , and it was not only out of respect of him and his power that they felt like intruders , uncertain and subdued , when they entered it . She had arranged the place for him , put pictures and things around . Her photograph was there and , Warrington thought , a breath of the scent she wore . Men entered this minute cabin almost aware of the feeling a man experiences whose business forces him into the bedroom of a woman whom he deeply respects but does not know . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that she was a Senator 's daughter , they did deeply respect her . Perhaps if Wright , the Seaman , for example , had been asked quickly in private by the right person why he respected her , and he had answered just as quickly before stopping to think that he did not know , he might have answered : " Because she loves him . " Once when she had started off on a trip to be gone for a few months , she had sent him a radiogram back from her steamer at sea . Delilah 's apparatus being temporarily out of commission , the message , " I love you , " had been received by the station ashore and then semaphored out to Delilah , anchored off Cavite . Bidot , the Quartermaster on watch , had been profoundly embarrassed on receiving the message , and as he had delivered it , carefully folded , to the Captain , he had stood more rigidly than usual at attention , his face almost lifeless with formality . The rest of the crew had been just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observed by a number of men about the deck who understood semaphore , and who had instantly made public this unprecedented communication . It was not because his wife was in love with him that they were upset . They would have been definitely indignant if she had not loved him , this man whom they accepted so thoroughly , who aroused  | in many of them a warm enthusiasm ; but it was because the message , as a message to him , seemed somehow outrageously inappropriate . Never again , however , would they envision him , small , wrinkled , his hair ineptly combed , save through the added cogency , the glow of this woman 's love . In this same way but more dimly and in much smaller measure , nearly every other person in the ship was illuminated for the others by the quality of some woman 's power over him . This quality betrayed itself most perceptibly at mail time , when Chief Gunner 's Mate Orlop , who served as Mail Orderly , having returned aboard with the monthly sack of mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up on the base of the midships torpedo-tube with an armful of mail . Starting with the topmost letter , he would call out the name on it . There would be a quick answering , " Here ! " and he would hold the letter down at arm 's length in the direction of the voice . He did this without looking away from the next letter , as if he were studying the inscription on it , or as if he deliberately were restraining his eyes from a trespass within the offguard expression on the face of the man to whom he was holding out the letter . i The instant Orlop was sighted approaching the ship with the sack , the cry , " Mail Ho ! " would ring up and down the deck , be taken up by voice after voice until the ship 's company would be crowded about the base of the torpedo-tube waiting for the appearance of the stack of letters under Orlop 's arm . When it did appear , a current of emotion would leap through the ship , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and its pressure would hold there until the last letter was handed out , for the stack of envelopes was not arranged in alphabetical order . The pressure of this emotion took many hours to subside , and it tainted even the most laborious day ( this invasion of the fabulous world in which they slept and ate and worked by bits of paper from the world lost to them save in dreams and memory but in which alone they believed ) with a kind of heady unreality . Crowded there waiting for the letters , some of the men behaved as if they actually were keeping an appointment . One  | would smooth his hair . Another would roll down and button the sleeves of his jumper . Over Ragatzo 's face would come an expression of sensual eagerness in the midst of which his lips would knot into a small smirk of confidence . Saunders would . become a little sullen like a man waiting to exact a customary accounting from a woman whom he bullied . The elder Carey brother just stood there a trifle sheepishly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling as if in anticipation of some minor , intimate miracle that had happened before and was about to happen again . Stengle , too , was expectant , but there was nothing excited about his expectancy . There , in that moment , waiting for the letter he received each month , he became , this remarkable little man dangerously exiled on fantastic alien shores , simply a tired , middle-aged mechanic , crossing a drab threshold after a hard day 's work for a family that would have resented the idea that he could be anything more . Olgan , the Cook , never received any mail . When the cry , " Mail Ho ! " would go up , Olgan now invariably walked into the forecastle and lay down on his bunk . If men came in there to read their letters , he put his arm over his eyes as if he were sleeping . A year or so before , he used to stand around watching the men receive their mail . He even used to watch them read it , his little , shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mate , whose persistent , routine gambling smacked of professionalism , had looked up from the reading of a long letter to find Olgan 's eyes fixed upon it . The letter was from Heller 's sister , a girl three years younger than he , who regarded his constant teasing as the thrilling and complimentary condescension of a hero . For an instant , as he was trapped , Olgan 's eyes had wavered up to meet Heller 's . In irony and disgust Heller had asked him , holding out the pages : " Here ... How would you like to read it ? " An expression of eagerness had come into Olgan 's face , and he had quickly extended his hand for the letter . Heller had jerked it back . " Why , you bastard ! ... I believe you would , " Heller had said . The Pharmacist 's Mate , who had a slim , hard body that was  | just above medium height and a handsome , reckless face , the clear definition of which was a trifle blurred by a corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recounted it to Rene , and the two of them , although Heller never before had been known to play a practical joke on anybody in the ship , had planned a trick on Olgan . They unearthed a big pink envelope somewhere and had it mailed to him , timing it so that , in all probability , it would be distributed with the monthly mail from the States . As Heller would have put it , the trick " got by " smoothly , " got by " as he , himself , and most of his manoeuvres usually did . He was the sole member of the crew , for example , who managed to wear his hair really long in civilian fashion ; and he kept this head of hair , brushed straight back from his forehead in a precise , oiled sweep of brown luxuriance , even through inspections . There were others in the ship , notably a Fireman , Second-Class , named Easterly , who wanted to wear their hair in this manner , who were quite improved in appearance by wearing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would permit his hair to grow an officer would dart a glance at him and say : " Better get your hair cut . " Easterly was the only one who was regularly persistent in the effort to emulate Heller , and each time he was ordered to cut his hair , he would grind out , almost audibly , in the wake of the order , as if Heller , himself , were giving it with some usurped authority , " That God damn pill-pusher gets away with murder . " To Heller 's face , however , Easterly always was good-humoured about this ; for the Pharmacist 's Mate once had arisen in the midst of a crap game and struck the gigantic Rene in the mouth and " gotten by " with it without further fighting or backing water . To have come in conflict with this peculiar quality in the fate of Heller would have been like defying some thoroughly believed in superstition . Orlop , standing up on the base of the torpedo-tube distributing the stack of mail , had taken a genuine second look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised tone , he had called it out . This was the first time in the two years he had been Mail Orderly that he had seen it on a letter . " Olgan ! "  | The Cook had had to be nudged by some one in the crowd before he had realized that it was his name that was being called , that there at the end of the outstretched arm was a large , intimate , pink envelope with his name written expansively across it in pencil . He had stood there staring at the envelope , his breath quickening . " Watch this .. . Watch this , " Heller and Rene had passed around the word . Impatiently Orlop had commanded , slightly waving the envelope : " Take it away . " Olgan almost had snatched the envelope , then looked around for a rift in the crowd about him through which to escape with it ; but as no one had stepped aside for him he had remained where he was , ineffectively picking at the flap . Another name was called , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover of the man 's action , as it were , had made haste to tear open the envelope and pull out the folded strip of toilet paper within , holding it in such a manner that the long strip had slowly unfolded clear down to the deck . The crowd had roared with laughter , and those nearest him had kept poking him with their fists in a jesting way . His eyes darting unseeingly here and there at the wall of hilarity that encircled him , and the curve of his stooped shoulders increasing as if he were trying to take shelter beneath it , he had stood there like a helpless animal that waits for surrounding danger either to destroy him or sweep on . It would be difficult to believe that what Olgan had been observing , in the days before Heller and Rene played the joke on him , was the transformation that took place in a man as he read his letter from home . These transformations , often dramatic , sometimes ridiculous , did take place , however . They took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such absurd dicta as , " Be natural , " " Be yourself . ' There is no " naturalness , " no " self " in the sense suggested by these personal slogans . Even in introspection a man " acts " a different personality according to which of the various backgrounds of his life , past or present , his thoughts and feelings may be dealing with . He can not see himself in essence ; he can see himself only as an actor before some other person either actual or ideal . . . " I often , " Warrington once told  | Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , " separate into two personalities at the same time , one of which stands off and watches or judges what I am or what I am doing . " Warrington , moreover , actually was more nearly " natural " and true to " himself " than anybody else in the ship ; that is , in the degree to which he approached being one character , because the parts he consented to act , the people he chose as audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually were restricted to three . One was the part he acted before the idealization of himself as judge , the second was the part he acted before the vision of the girl at home , the third was the part he acted before Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . It was for that reason that so many of the men regarded him as what in a civilian group would have been called a snob , the reason that made Cavendish , for example , say of him , " I do n't get that bird . " On the other hand , a man who acts the different part required by each of the different people whom he meets , setting each up as a particular audience and skilfully acting the character required , is a " good fellow " and is understood by all even though the part he acts before one is Hamlet and before another Falstaff . It is a common occurrence for a man to come from a stimulating meeting with a friend and , continuing to act the person he was before that friend , find himself adjudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before remembering to abandon the old part and step into the new : And the man who is remarked upon as being nothing in a crowd of people who know him well , who is neutralized when faced with the necessity of acting so many various parts at the same time , but who shines as an interesting personality when alone with any individual in that crowd , is as common as the remark : " What can she see in that man ? " This law , in its operations on Delilah 's men , tended to make them seem abnormally alike , strangely simple , in the way that leads civilians to remark on observing a ship 's crew at work , " Why , they 're just children playing . " Each man in the crew who submitted to his environment became more or less the compound of all the characters he would have acted when face to face with each man in the ship individually . He faced , so to speak , the entire crew as if it were a single individual , an in-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant , but an individual with whom he was inescapably confined , under incomparable intimacy , to eat , sleep and work . Thus the complex character he acted , clear and simple to the point of childishness in appearance , was no more elementary than a beam of pure , white light whose bright simplicity imprisons the conflict of seven individual colours as well as a myriad of vibrations , high and low , that escape the eye . At mail time , however , waiting for a letter from a woman vital in his life , taking hold of an envelope with her handwriting upon it , reading her actual thoughts and words , a man behaved as if he were in her very presence , as if suddenly the emotions that arose had isolated him with her and obligated him to play only the character he acted before her . This character , which the man otherwise never acted in the ship , the crew forgave him , as they expected him to forgive each of them ; and gaining from his behaviour some idea of the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole responsibility of the business , this ambush of his control and his integrity , to her . There was but one other person in the ship besides Olgan who had no woman behind him , and that was Ensign Woodbridge ; yet Ensign Woodbridge received more letters from women than anybody else . Behind Olgan there was a vacuum besetting him with all its melancholy stresses ; but behind Ensign Woodbridge there simply was a crowded meaninglessness , women who had been his mistresses and others who would be his mistresses , no doubt , if he troubled to manage it . Having no mother , no sister , no female relatives who had a hold on him , women formed for him little more than a part of the mud and beauty and danger of a world created for him to conquer and use . It was inconceivable that any woman ever would crack that thin , hard shell of glistening armour in which he strode through and over them . If he had received a public message saying , " I love you , " the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner that would have said for him , in sincere admiration , " Another one . . . That bastard ! " and for her , in sincere pity , " The poor little bitch . "  | Although Ensign Woodbridge thought in a very cogent manner about other things ( in the field of astronomy , for example , he was on the road to becoming learned ) he did not think much about women : he mostly just took them for granted . When he did think about them at all , it was in bright spurts of thought that had to do with the idea that woman was a semi-human creature built around and for that organ of the body whose equivalent in the male was tacked on the outside of him as a sort of afterthought . He would have been astounded if he had been told that he did not respect women , and so would any of the women who knew him . He literally would have given his life in defence of any woman who had committed herself to him , and his considerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were remarked upon from Shanghai to Zamboanga . Much as one evolves a code with which to deal with horses or children , partly to protect the children or the horses , partly to protect oneself , Ensign Woodbridge had evolved a code that rigidly governed his relationship with women . He would not , for example , be lover to a woman whose husband had introduced him to her ; nor would he tale advantage of a situational or economic need in a woman 's life . Those men who used liquor to condition a woman for their advances he looked upon with much the same light contempt that he bestowed upon men who cheated at solitaire ; and he scrupulously forbore , even when it would have helped him in his campaign for a woman , to imply by so much as a dropping of the eyes that a given woman had been his mistress . He scorned the idea that because a girl was a virgin she must not be touched ; and he went for any woman that he desired , aged between sixteen and thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proscriptions , as a bullet goes for a target . This code was not an affectation with him . He summoned to its enforcement all the formidable moral power within him , summoned it to such an extent that he actually would have looked upon becoming the lover of a close friend 's wife as the most obscene of treacheries , as a thing almost as reprehensible as incest . His fastidiousness ably complemented the moral force that he brought to the maintenance of this code , because it prevented him from simply tak-  | ing a woman because she was a woman , from taking her for the mere primitive release inherent in the culmination of the act with her . He never once , as Ensign Snell often did , left the ship with the intention , private or avowed , " Well . . . guess I 'll go ashore and get bred . " This same fastidiousness restricted the province of his desire to the choicest women , so that months sometimes went by through which he lived a continent life . Those who sought for flaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , on the other hand , affected to believe that male prowess was unturbulent within him . However , even women who had not been in love with him but who had accepted him only once out of sheer desire , remembered what he had been to them . What made it difficult for the women who could not resist him or who did not want to resist him was his conception of them as objects of his desire and the swiftness with which he sought to attain them . It seemed to him that in the instant he saw and desired a woman , he should have her ; because what came through to him from her in that instant was she , herself , in essence . The form of her body , the spirit with which it was carried , the individual life that glowed in her eyes , the primal thing she did to the vibrations around her , these were really she , the she he wanted to hold in his arms and possess : And he felt that the moment she began to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act the character , too , that she must be for him eventually , she obliterated the essence he had desired in the first place and became , to the degree he was forced " to know " her before he possessed her , a being quite different from her he had wanted in the beginning . When a woman had been able to hold him off for a considerable period of " **31;677;TOOLONG , " he would then find in his arms , not the thing he had desired , not the woman , herself ; but something compounded of all the schoolteachers who had had a pronounced effect upon her , her father and mother , the books she had read , the characters in plays she had seen and the other men she had known . A number of women had said to themselves , " That is the man I am going to marry " ; but when they did not succeed in  | this they harboured no bitterness . Some of them , for years after they saw him for the last time , persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were some great and inaccessible personage who , in passing , had touched their lives with fire . They were not women , but only men of a certain type , who contended that he " let women down , " that he was not the man for a decent woman to associate with . Usually , however , these were not the men who had women as a responsibility : the latter knew exactly where they were with Ensign Woodbridge : they knew that their wives were safe and that they had to be on guard over their daughters or sisters . Parents did what they could about their daughters , warned them , discreetly forbade them to be alone with him , or helplessly " trusted " them ; but if a man had had to commit his wife to a brother officer for safe-keeping in an emergency , he would have chosen his friend , Woodbridge , and felt secure . Ensign Woodbridge was a falconlike being , a person born to victory , an officer who got excited but who inspired in the men , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead them in a skirmish ashore , a surge of relief and confidence . When one asked Ensign Woodbridge how he was , he invariably said , " Very well , thanks " ; but one got an impression from his smile and the energy radiating from his body that he had said , " Splendid ! " and there was , in fact , a kind of splendour ever about him . This splendour was not merely the illumination of the wealth that always had been in his family , nor his consciousness that for hundreds of years his blood had flowed through men who had led in law , religion and war : It derived from a kind of untarnished virtue , a shining virtue still perfect with lack of irresistible ordeal and clouding test , a virtue of which the years had not yet had time to prove the tragic truth that " The hardest knife ill used loth lose his edge . " Nevertheless , Ensign Woodbridge was the kind of man whom prosperous grocery or hat store magnates , or those who should have been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was detached for duty in China , even his enemies , in a sense , regretted it . His departure seemed , in some unaccountable way , to de-  | crease the significance of the community from which they , themselves , derived significance . The women , including those who were quite beyond the range of his amorous attentions , had been stirred by the report of his arrival when Delilah steamed up from the south , and now the news that he was to leave gave them a moment of poignant dissatisfaction , like the passing of some bright danger . 8 Delilah 's crew had been thinned out considerably . It had been reduced , as a matter of fact , to a skeleton crew ; although this status , which would have implied for them a kind of unsettling relegation to the stagnant backwaters of life , was not fully realized by the men . They had been led to understand the absence of their shipmates more or less in the sense of their having gone off on unusually extended missions from which , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as it occurred to them to be concerned , there being little work to do , the ship merely was temporarily depopulated in much the same way she always was when large working parties or expeditions were sent ashore , as she had been many times , in the immediate past , down south . What seemed the only unusual thing about it , the greater duration of the condition , could be viewed with complacence ( no more than just tainted by over-emphasis ) since she was held up for repairs . They felt directly very little of what tormented the Captain , who , gaze as he might at the grimy Commission Pennant still fluttering from the mainmast , never for a moment faced away from the fact that his ship was in pieces and his crew really dispersed . The men began to grow casual and relaxed in their movements in the way men do who live on land and take on flesh . Their muscles and inner-ears seemed to be losing the memory of years spent on decks alive with the breathing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer hours of liberty in Cavite and nearby Manila . The most arduous duty that fell to them in those days was the rigging of the dock for a dance given by Lieutenant Fitz-  | patrick . They entered into this with enthusiasm . The Executive Officer had required of them only that they stretch a large tarpaulin for a dancing surface and set up a few strips of nipa fronds to screen the more unsightly portions of the dock . He had asked this favour of the deck force only ; but the whole ship 's company turned to . In the boats , towed by the motordory , they invaded a swamp down the shore and literally denuded it of nipa . With this they transformed the roofed clock into a pavilion that from a distance looked like the palace of an island king . From the jungle trees they hacked away whole limbs on which orchids grew and set them into the walls of the pavilion so that the blossoms now actually grew there . They hauled up boat load after boat load of all the creepers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into place to form panels around the top edges of the walls and around the broad , low portal that occurred in each side of the pavilion . Within the precise luxuriance of these panels they concealed strings of coloured electric lights . When this paradisiacal bower was but half-finished , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was so impressed by it that he instantly changed his mind about the kind of dance it was going to be . In the beginning he had asked just a few intimate friends to " dinner , " people who would understand his asking them to a party on a dirty stretch of dock ; but when he looked at that utterly neat expanse of waxed canvas dance floor being so gorgeously and originally enclosed , he invited everybody , even those before whom he never chose to appear save in all the protective social armour at his disposal . The dance turned out to be the most notable informal event of several years , and this was influenced , in important degree , by the fall of those circumstances that made it an effective spectacle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solicitude . At the start of the dance , nearly all that was left of the crew had gathered on Delilah 's darkened deck , opposite one of the portals of the pavilion , to have a brief look ; and then , even including many who were free to go ashore , they simply had stayed there all through the party , sitting on the Port  | Engine-room Hatch , the base of the torpedo-tube and two rows of mess benches , listening to the music and watching the dancing . Highly critical of the dancers and their deportment , estimating the women 's figures , smiling in admiring approval if the Captain , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick or Ensign Snell achieved some little spectacular success or grinning sheepishly if they met with failure , the men were unexpectedly delighted with the whole thing , as if this officers ' affair were a spectacle staged especially for their entertainment . Warrington , thankful that he was in darkness , sat between Mendel and O'Connel on the base of the torpedo-tube . Each time the orchestra launched the first bar of some personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would surge upon the beach of his memory and leave him brooding over the music , the gowns of the women , the good manners , the delicate drifts of perfume , the rhythmic friction sound of dancing feet on canvas as if these were , not so much the ghosts of excitements lost in the graceful world he had abandoned , but premonitions of some happy time wandering into his mind from that distant future that one day would be the glorious past . Horner , the Seaman , however , thought that the music was not lively enough . . . " that was no way to play When You Wore a Tulip . " Ragatzo said it was too bad Mr. Woodbridge was not there . . . " he 'd make that Jg. from the Navy Yard look like just a punk . " Cruck contemptuously said that the women were " only egg-shells , only egg-shells " ; but he ferociously admonished any man who , in the most hypothetical degree , was guilty of a noise , an exclamation or an action that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sat out there in the darkness and watched the dance with an almost entranced attention were , for the officers and their women , something not less powerful than an audience but something much less formalistic . They were something that made the officers play quite consciously to the gallery , as it were , that made them bring to the fore such masculine dominance and gallantry as each was capable of , and they behaved somewhat as men do who want to give the impression to other men that they are the masters of the women around  | them . This compounded the excitement in the atmosphere and lent to the party an unusual gaiety and voltage . Women , who long had grown accustomed to the submission of their husbands , to their uxoriousness or to their indifference , responded with a surprised spark of alertness , resistance or a delightful inquietude . Some thought the especial virtue of the party lay in the unusualness of its site and the decorations . Some of the women thought it was because they were rediscovering in their men a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others attributed the success to Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's punch , and they pressed him for the recipe . On the whole , however , they drank less than usual , restraining themselves from the very nectar they thought was making them gay , restraining themselves , automatically , because they were under the eyes of the unseen men they sensed out there in the dark , the influence that was giving them , in large measure , what they attributed to the alcohol . This restraining influence , extemporaneously imposed upon the party by the watching men , more accurately indicated the nature of the crew 's intrusion than did the " life " their unseen spectatorship induced . The crew formed there , in effect , that formidable ring of dowagers who sit about the perimeters of ballrooms , smiling , nodding , raising eyebrows , silently maintaining by the sheer pressure of their chaperonage a bias in favour of graciousness and a pervading avoidance of an appearance of evil . The Captain 's wife , who was having a quite successful evening , felt this pressure now very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man other than her husband , a little as if she were circling the floor in the presence of a self-deputized batch of her husband 's relatives , and she even was a bit defiant when she walked out on the margin of the dock , to cool off between dances , with the handsome Jg. from the Navy Yard who clearly had established himself as the lion of the party . She would not be surprised , and she smiled impatiently as the absurd little idea scuttled through her mind , if she were to hear , in case she stayed out there too long , the warning clump of heavy footfalls in the nearby shadow and " Unc " Blood 's voice  | saying something like , " O . . . Excuse me . . . I 'm looking for my hammer . " The dance climaxed , although it was sometime later before the band played Goodnight , Everybody , with an impromptu gesture consistent with the tone that had characterized the affair from the first : Admiral Douglas ' wife , on taking her leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commandingly hinted that she would like to have it to take home . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick tried to get it for her , but it was too high to pluck , and the limb on which it grew was too firmly fastened for him easily to pull it down . As if appealing for assistance , he instinctively glanced out the portal in the direction of the ship . Immediately , in response to this glance , Hardwood jumped from the ship , across the intervening three feet of water , to the dock . He made straight for the orchids , holding an open jackknife out before him as if to advertise his purpose and apologize for his intrusion . A tipsy officer shouted , " Gangway for a sailor ! " The crowd of white and gold uniforms and scented organdy dresses parted smoothly before the hurrying Hardwood as if engaging in some kind of ceremony , and the Seaman , locating the heavy brace on the outside of the nipa , climbed it to the branch of orchids . He cut it free and leaped to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Douglas with a deep , graceful bow which he unexpectedly summoned from the cumbrous mass of his muscular body . Out of the darkness of the ship there burst a roar of spontaneous cheering . As if inspired by this , Hardwood turned to another woman and , saying , " One for you , ma'am , " plucked and presented to her another of the orchids . Then , as he proceeded right along the dock renewing his supply of blossoms from the wall and presenting them to the ladies , the officer who had shouted , " Gangway for a sailor ! " began singing , and the others joined in : " Stand Navy down the field , Sails set to the sky " When Hardwood had jumped out so intrusively to help with the orchids , the materialization of the crew 's pressure  | upon her , which the Captain 's wife had half-jokingly expected , had caught her unprepared . Coming suddenly at her from an angle somewhat different from the one over which she had smiled impatiently , it had brought to the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the boy would be understood and handled sympathetically , the kind of look that takes possession of a woman 's face when her precocious child suddenly dashes into the midst of some grown-up activity in a burst of innocent , exuberant helpfulness : And her blue eyes had smiled with relief ( a smile reflected in Ensign Snell 's eyes , too , in that moment ) and then with more than relief when she saw that Hardwood not only was all right , but that he was triumphant . 9 The day after the dance there were still further transfers of people from the ship . Ensign Snell , with a small party of men , was assigned to a Landing Force that was to march across Luzon ; and O'Connel , Mendel and Warrington went to the submarines . There was no little surprise at Warrington 's transfer . He was the last man they expected to see on a transfer list so long as Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was Executive Officer ; but late in the afternoon this surprise was swept away and forgotten before the resurge , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the ship when she had been flung so urgently into the midst of more repairs than she had bargained for . What happened was that Delilah 's four sister ships , each of which was identical with her in every detail save the number on the bow and the identification form at the masthead , steamed into the bay and tied up alongside various docks at the Base . Within two hours after tying up , even before some of the people around the Base knew the destroyers were down from China , the ships were set upon by crowds of workmen who began the same extensive repair operations being suffered by Delilah . This , certainly , " meant something . " It may have been that , now , no explanation , even the most surprising true explanation , would have proved adequate to absorb the psychic  | geyser that swirled up from the crew and spread to make itself felt wherever , from Jolo to Hankow , there was a handful of Navy people to receive news of the portent . Even the few days ' headstart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be spared : Delilah 's men , staring through the dusk , realized that the work on the other destroyers was to progress through the night . This disturbing event , combined with the fact of his finally having to sleep in his bungalow ashore because the repair work now had extended to the propeller shafts beneath the floor of his cabin , achieved with ' the Captain something no other power had seemed able to effect . It divided his loyalty , tore him away from Delilah and set him up in an office ashore ; for he was not only Captain of his own ship but Division Commander as well . This command of the five ships as a unit always had remained for him , except briefly at torpedo and target practice , almost entirely a theoretical concept , a sort of official technicality . Although he used the pronoun " my " in connection with those under his command , he rarely had been heard to say , " my Division . " Even days after the other destroyers had arrived , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another as Division Commander , and after being immersed for hours in conferences with the other four Captains over drawings and plans that did not concern Delilah , he still said , " the Division " and " my ship . " If , on one of the daily visits the Captain scrupulously made to Delilah , no matter how exacting his duties grew in the administration of this unprecedented Division activity , he had been heard to say , " my Division , " his relationship with Delilah 's men would have suffered a subtle dislocation that would have left them overtly disquieted . As it was , the intimacy between him and them , tacit and highly formalized , an intimacy far greater in essence than that between them and any other officer in the ship , underwent a dilution ; and this negative barrier tended to isolate him from the men much as his refusal to give the three officers a clue to the meaning of these extraordinary repairs had detached him a little from them . He was distinctly aware , when he came aboard now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | not simply as the Captain of the ship , but also with a strain of that larger attitude the lack of which he would have resented on boarding any other ship in the Division . Sensing it there , in his own ship , it somehow gave him an uncomfortable feeling , as if he had been made the victim of an excluding gesture . It was this , perhaps , that made him go poking about the ship on his visits in an aggressively proprietary manner no one ever had observed in him before . He would descend to his room and rearrange a few objects there in seeming accordance with some precise intention ; or he would lean over an engine-room hatch and fasten his gaze on one thing after another below in a way that gave an impression that it was his hands he was using rather than his eyes . Once lie climbed up to the signal rack behind the Radio Shack and began pulling out the signals and looking at them in a purposeful way . When he felt eyes gazing down on him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , for he began jerking the flags around with brusque , rightful gestures . Bidot , Cavendish and Arnold , watching him from the bridge above , smiled broadly , sympathetically , a flush of understanding touching their feelings .. . the Captain , down there , was declaring himself " in , " behaving intimately with the private mechanics of the ship , a privilege denied , by regulation and tradition , even to the Admiral , much more to the Division Commander . A rumour began to circulate that he was to be relieved of his command of Delilah so that he could devote all his time to the duty of Division Commander . On the night that he first got wind of this possibility , he walked straight out of the house where he was dining , after the most perfunctory of excuses , and headed for his ship . . . That would be a fine thing . . . to step clean out of the rank of ship commanders up into the high company of those who commanded only units ... the ladder was presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . all he would have to do was climb ... climb . . . climb up out of the necessity of getting his ship back together again ... of getting his men back in her ... the two Carey brothers ... and Woodbridge ... and yes ... himself , too , by God ! . . . If he played his cards right now , he would be Borden , Division Corn-  | mander . . . then Borden , Flotilla Commander . . . then Borden ... He stood on Delilah 's quarter-deck and stared across the dark film of water glinting unhealthily under the covered moon . The thickness of the night seemed to lie in the miasma , esoteric and musky , that rose from the ring of oriental tidewater in which were mired his ship , the hovels of the Base , the four other destroyers in the distance , the few blurred stars close overhead and the whispered rise of his fate . In his feelings and in the soul of his mind he could not seem to get his apperception of reality significantly past this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . He fixed his gaze determinedly on the other destroyers one after another . Flaring over there in the unclear darkness with the orange and blue fires of forges and welding torches , they seemed like long cauldrons boiling frantically in the night under the sinister impatience of witches who knew dreadfully and surely what they wanted . He congratulated himself again as he stood staring at the apparition of his new opportunity , congratulated himself like a small , neat Macbeth there in the fetid darkness , while the many wrinkles of his face grew elongated and stiff , and his hands clutched tensely the topmost of those bronze cables that kept Delilah 's men from falling overboard . 10 It had seemed as improbable to Lieutenant Fitzpatrick as it had to the men that he ever would put Warrington 's name on one of the successive draft lists he was being called upon to make out . That he finally did so could not be attributed to the reasons that had crept up on him after the event . H2 had put Warrington 's name down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more strictly impartial in his case than in regard to any other ; and Warrington had been the youngest and least valuable man on the bridge . However , when the demand first had arrived for two men out of the Engineer 's Force and one signalman to be sent to the submarines , there had been no such thoughts in his head . He had had little difficulty in selecting O'Connel and Mendel  | as the two men out of the Engineer 's Force to be sent to the dangerous little craft ; and he had actually been conscious of a hope , as he had written down their names , that circumstances might keep them there , that somehow in the mix up of this transfer business he might get back a couple of other men in their stead . He had been a trifle surprised at finding that this was his attitude toward O'Connel . He had thought that he believed that the Irishman was part of the cherished tone and colour of the ship , that he believed what he once had said in describing O'Connel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively by men like that wild Irishman " ... That , however , was just the trouble . . . he was wild and crazy and unpredictable ... he was TNT on the loose . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had put his name down with the feeling that he ought not to get him back , that he ought to transfer him to the submarines , that the submarines ought to transfer him to some other station , that that station in turn ought to transfer him and so on to the day of his pensioning . The Navy was no place for crazy men . . . nor for Jews . . . one could imagine a Jew dying as Christ on a cross , but not as Horatius at a bridgehead . IIe would transfer them both . The demand for the signalman had puzzled him . He never had heard of a signalman being sent to a submarine . He thought they must have made a mistake . He had queried the Personnel Office at the Base and had found that there had been no mistake . The submarines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they wanted a good signalman on each boat . As a matter of fact , he had told himself , he could spare people from the bridge at this time more easily than any others . He would send Arnold . Then , on the instant , with pencil poised to write Arnold 's name , a strange cloud of revulsion had swept through him , a revulsion that had had nothing to do with Arnold , but that yet had kept him from putting down the man 's name . It had been a kind of nameless , hidden fear flaming into the open as if to illuminate the imminent , fatal loss of a saving opportunity , a flame that , as it had persisted , had chemically changed some dominating attitude of his emotions , burning away the supports of his feelings so that he had seemed to  | be dropping down suddenly through great clear depths with a painful vacuum at the pit of his stomach . He had written Warrington 's name on the transfer list . Then in utter , empty , unhoped-for relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yeoman , saying : " Copy and post it . " Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had not been present when O'Connel , Mendel and Warrington had left the ship . Immediately after ordering the list posted , he had gone ashore feeling released into a kind of new , fresh being . He would not have been able to explain really how he felt , nor , if he had been able to , why he felt that way . As he strolled along briskly in the sunshine , he was exultant over a new sense of freedom . He had mysteriously got himself back again . He had plunged out of an unhealthy storm back to solid ground . Even if Warrington had been an officer or an equal ashore , such an involving friendship would not have been too sound a thing . Never again would he get so deep into anybody 's being ; and he must never let anybody get so deep into him ... " But it 's over . . . settled very simply for good and all . . . I 'll see to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , physically drunk , with the feeling of belonging to himself alone once more . He gave a light pull at the visor of his cap , setting it slightly to one side . He glanced , alertly gallant , into a passing carromata , and smiled exuberantly at the pale , little mestiza sitting alone in the shadowed corner of the semiopen carriage like an impassive , delicate insect poised on the wings of her full mango cloth sleeves . As her carriage passed him swiftly , she let her handkerchief flick out and trail almost imperceptibly for an instant in the light air beside her . With a free and easy promptness , but just faintly shadowed by a strange self-consciousness of its freedom , he swung toward a carriage waiting for hire at the nearby curb . Again , some kind of strength seemed to be dissolving warmly , exquisitely away from the pit of his stomach . It interfered with his breath as he tried to call sharply to the dozing driver and horses : " Let 's go ! . . . There . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come with none of this heady bursting into discovery of unexpected release : But he , too , was free , calmly , tragically free , free of the nameless , restless  | pressure within him that he had come to regard , come to regard aggressively , as the price of that friendship the lack of which , even in this heavy moment , he found difficulty in facing . As he had stared at the posted list , he had told himself that this blow was not unexpected , and his mind had seemed to use the word , " blow , " as one customarily uses the word , " solution . " Not for a moment did he regard his transfer as the temporary expedient that included the others who had gone ; he knew that it was to be permanent , that it was a dissolution . He had walked stiffly forward along the deck to say good-bye to the bridge crew . Then he had gone below to pack his bag . The same fierce glaze had come to his eyes that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air that he had breathed had unsettled his throat and his lungs . It had seemed to him that he had been walking through an abandoned house in which he once had lived . In the forecastle , through whose cagelike tiers o f grey metal bunks the port-holes were sending beams of yellow light , he had been observed by Mendel the moment he had conic through the doorway . After staring at him for many seconds through the centre tier of bunks , Mendel finally had circled around to Warrington 's locker and silently helped him pack his books . Those for which there was no room the Jew had packed very words of comfort and exhortation he had wanted to speak to the face , that he had been tortured to speak into the welter of pain , discomfiture and anger that had smouldered behind it . In oblique desperation the Jew had been struggling for something to say that would have borne not at all on the cause of his friend 's suffering but that yet would have served accurately as anodyne for it . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while his wide lips had almost sneered with the frustration of his compassion : " This will fix us up with the real thing . . . just reading about danger and stuff is n't enough . . . those submarines are the works ... they 're lousy with danger . . . they got plenty of excitement . " Warrington 's brain , apparently , just had not identified the words . He had said , " Yes , " and had begun lashing his ham-  | mock . While Mendel had been speaking , Warrington had been struggling with his astonishment , with his heavy resentment over the fact that so much that was deeply personal could have been dismissed with such an impersonal gesture as that posted order . Mendel , conscious of how far his distorted effort would have missed the mark , had been relieved that Warrington had not heard him . 11 Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , at a quarter to nine the next morning , stood at the end of the dock , near Delilah 's stern , and watched the little submarines lumber out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , one behind the other at about hundred yard intervals , struggling and foaming along in the quiet brown water of the bay like over-fat grey pigs with awninged howdahs on their slightly awash backs . To Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , they appeared somehow clean and definite out there under the sun-blue morning sky . He glanced around at the greasy , splintered dock on which he stood , now completely denuded of the greenery that had transformed it , and then at the dishevelled ship alongside him . It looked rusty and deserted despite the animal-like little workmen crawling about it . He moved his shoulders restlessly . He would , he thought , like to serve in a submarine ... " not in one of those Noah 's Arks out there . . . they could barely creep along ... but in a capable , modern one . . . like one of those fast K-Boats at Pearl Harbour .. . That would be real Navy . . . on one 's own with a handful of picked men in the depths of the sea . " He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a God damn coal barge when you came right down to it . . . ferrying back and forth . " With a sense of futility that spread in calm malignancy into every reach of his being , he glanced out again over the muddy glitter of the bay . The last submarine in line had fallen a considerable distance behind . He watched mechanically as it gradually lost headway and relaxed into a stupid rolling and drifting with the almost invisible motion of the placid water . " Break-down , " he guessed , " . . . The whole , stinking , antiquated Fleet is breaking down . "  | He wondered if any of the men he had transferred were on her . " Must be hot as hell drifting out there in that blistering calm ... A lot of help Warrington would be to them in this fix it that was the one he was on . " The water splashed restively around the piling beneath his feet . Through the wide cracks in the planking a stench of some floating dead thing thrust vaguely up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit in and do more than his share . . . no room for excess baggage there .. . only twelve or so men . . . and all of them crowded into one little compartment along with everything else , torpedoes , engines , tools , ballast , periscope , storage batteries , men ... " The submarine , which now had been left far behind by the others in the assurance that if she could not continue on she could signal the Base for a tow , drifted into such position that Lieutenant Fitzpatrick could make out the number on her . " Schiff 's boat . . . Ensign Schiff , phooey ! . . . it would be his boat that broke down . . . a Jew had no business being a naval officer . . . much less in command of a vessel . . . Schiff was clever as hell , you had to hand him that . . . but their guts and blood were sour . . . no iron in them . . . they ... " Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had levelled in a stare of amazement . Out there three men had been spat abruptly up into the air from the conning-tower in the most ridiculous fashion . Like acrobatic clowns in a vaudeville act , they sprawled laughably for a moment in the air between the submarine and the blazing sun . Then they splashed successively into the water . Ile watched for them to swim back to the submarine ; but there seemed to be no movement where they had fallen . There was no movement on the submarine either , not a sign of a man between the four stanchions that had held the small awning . The awning had disappeared too : Only a ragged wisp hung at the tip of each stanchion where its corners had been fastened . The submarine was moving , moving uncertainly and very slowly in a meaningless direction , moving , he thought , through the still heat like an abandoned derelict in a light breeze . Suddenly Lieutenant Fitzpatrick began to shout , nearly screaming as if under the assault of some desperate awakening .  | " Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get away the lifeboat ! " " No , by God , that was n't it , " he told himself . " Explosion ! ... that 's what it was ... that thing had exploded without a sound , without a puff of smoke ! " Lieutenant Fitzpatrick swung around and faced the men that were springing toward him along the dock . " Get away the Rescue Party ! . . . Explosion on submarine six hundred yards due north ! " A number of men automatically followed him as he leapt from the dock onto Delilah and made for the starboard whaleboat , which still hung forlornly at its davits . Most of the men on the dock , however , had been thrown into helpless confusion by the officer 's shouts . Nobody knew what to do marooned there out of the ship on the cluttered dock . The regularly organized Rescue Party had been broken up by the transfers . . . " Who goes ? . . . Where 's the boat ? . . . What gear ? . . . What tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sung out , in response to the officer 's order , " A-w-a-y-y-y the Rescue Party ! " in a chant that had been heard clearly far beyond the limits of the dock and which had alarmed that whole section of the Base into concerned alertness ; but around him men did nothing but shout back uncertainly and mill towards a view of the bay . Cruck grabbed Wright by the throat and flung him ferociously towards Delilah . The Seaman 's pimpled face crashed stunningly against a railing stanchion as he grabbed frantically to keep himself from falling into the narrow crevice between the ship and the dock . His dirty hands groped childishly at his strawcoloured hair as his stunned senses struggled with the meaning in the bellowing behind him : " Lay aft the Rescue Party ! . . . Lay aft all hands ! . . . The starboard whaleboat , you dirty bastards ! . . . move ! " The men had stood there , a sweating , wildly disturbed mob , frustrated in the face of Cruck 's uninforming violence , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starboard whaleboat . " Then they charged at the ship as if , like Wright , they had been flung there . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and those who had followed him had  | gotten the boat down in the water . Forsythe , the Seaman , stood in the bow fending her off with a boat-hook . Easterly , the Fireman , Second-Class , was at the stern , awkwardly holding her in by clutching at one of Delilah 's open port-holes . The officer , a thick streak of grease disfiguring his white cap-cover , balanced himself on spread legs in the middle of the whaleboat and with grim impatience fixed his eyes in the direction from which , on the other side of the ship , came the fury of Cruck 's shouting . All at once the whole ship 's company flooded across the ship and massed at the railing above him , a great , arrested wave of staring eyes . His gaze met , for an instant , that of a man in the crowd . He lashed an order at these eyes , an order that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... Then to another pair of eyes : " Get a fire extinguisher " . . . Another : " Get a bucket " . . . " sledge " .. . " bar " . . . " line " . . . But he was thinking : " Warrington 's on that boat . . it could n't be any other way . . . that 's the way life works .. Christ ! " After Chief Machinist 's Mate Stengle had climbed down , armed with a Stinson wrench and a hacksaw , the boat started to pull away ; but when Lieutenant Fitzpatrick saw I feller , the Pharmacist 's Mate , fighting his way through the crowd at the rail , he ordered the boat to back water . . . " Got to have this man , God damn him . " The Pharmacist 's Mate , who evidently had been taking a bath , was wet and naked save for a pair of drawers and his emergency kit slung by a strap over his shoulder . Even at that , for two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the only one on the way to the submarine , which still was circling slowly in the smooth water like a small whale tortured into imbecile helplessness by the relentless sun . When they were some three hundred yards from the stricken craft , the atmosphere of being abandoned that pervaded it was abruptly dissipated by the figure of a man emerging from the small , black hole of the conning-tower hatch . Out waist high , he bent at the middle in an eerie manner and writhed face down across the bulge of the submarine 's top-side into the water . Those pulling at the oars in the whaleboat could not , of course ,  | sec this ; but the cry that arose from the others in the boat , a cry of consternation and discovery , empowered their pulling with furious desperation . That helpless figure sliding awkwardly , blindly into the sea there had slugged through the abstraction of disaster with the personal reality of tortured men trying to claw their way up out of frightful confinement . Another blind figure arose from the submarine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to locate the water , then leapt insanely as if trusting to chance . The unseen splash of his body , counterpointed by the involuntary sounds this tore from the mouths of men who could see it , shattered the self-control of some of those at the oars . Easterly , the Fireman , Second-Class , missed the water altogether with his blade . Confusion swept the stroke of the six oarsmen behind whose backs something horrible was happening . Easterly fought viciously with the oar defying his sweaty , blistering hands and screamed silently against the injustice of his own incompetence and the fate that had driven him into this intolerable corner : He never had touched an oar more than a dozen times in his life . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had begun to shout the stroke : " Pull ! . . . Pull ! . . . Pull ! . . . " The officer 's eyes were clutching at the figures in the water . " . . . Stroke ! . . . Stroke ! ... ( He probably was pinned inside the thing ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heave the oar that was defeating him over the side . As he did so , he flung his head around in a reckless , relieving gesture that permitted him to see behind him . . . " The hell with the God damn oar ! . . . Doing more harm than good with it anyway . " However , the instant he had adjusted himself to the scene behind him , he semi-consciously leapt at the idea of some compensatory act , something that would assuage his own agony under the pressure of the horror only a few yards away there that he just had betrayed by flinging away his oar . As a result of his defection the boat had swung off its course , almost broadside to the direction in which the submarine slowly was moving . In the intervening strip of water , near the whaleboat , his searching eyes found a head and an arm . Further disrupting the efforts of the oarsmen to get reorganized , he stood up in the boat pointing wildly and  | trying to shout above the roar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overboard after the man barely afloat in the water . Somebody knocked him back on the thwart . He arose again , was knocked back once more ; and as the whaleboat was oared toward the figure in the water he crouched there , half out of the boat , every feature alive with frustration because he could not jump overboard after that man . It was Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , leaning authoritatively far out from the stern , both hands extended eagerly , who got hold of the man . Mendel 's head was denuded completely of hair , and the flesh of his skull and face had turned a strange , parboiled white . His hawklike nose was bulged out of shape , and the closed lids of his eyes had become very thick and purple . The officer grasped him violently under the armpits and shook him . " Mendel ! . . . Mendel ! " The line of the Jew 's wide , sensuous mouth slowly changed its shape , like a small , torpid serpent that had been disturbed . His breath was coming and going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose strip of membrane . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick half lifted him out of the water and , putting his mouth close to the Jew 's ear , said : " Where 's Warrington ? . . . Is he inside ? . . . Did he get out ? " The Jew 's wet face was a mask of unrestrained resignation and submission , like the face of an invalid who has had enough of pain and of life . He partially opened his eyes for a moment to look at this face close to his as he said : " He 's on another boat . " In the spasm of exquisite relief and comfort that struck through Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , his hands and arms unconsciously relaxed , permitting Mendel to slip back into the muddy water . He simply sank beneath it without another movement , as if he somehow had expended the last fateful vestige of a pretext for remaining above it . The momentum of the whaleboat carried it several yards past where the Jew sank before those in the stern of the boat , including Lieutenant Fitzpatrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of him . The moment this generally was perceived , the oarsmen began  | to swing the boat back toward the spot . With a kind of ferocity Easterly once more prepared to dive into the water . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick now , however , insuperably was possessed with his obligation to the disaster as a whole ; and from the depths of this obligation his voice , irresistible and calm , rose to hold the men back from their excited effort to return to Mendel . Into the face of their confused , unexpressed averseness he shouted , as he pointed astern at other small boats that were coming up swiftly : " They 'll get him . " When the whaleboat , dominated by the first real semblance of order that had prevailed since it had left Delilah 's side , was almost upon the submarine , Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was astonished to see the stricken craft suddenly increase its speed . As if this had been a symptom of further disaster , he stared belligerently at the ominous little conning-tower expecting to see its dark mouth vomit more victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ! " What it was doing was careening erratically around a turn of its unguided course before the thrust of its greater speed . " If it would only turn this way , " thought Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , " a man could jump onto her deck and take the wheel .. . steer her into the dock . " He tried to direct the whaleboat across the submarine 's new course , but in the very moment he thought he finally was intercepting her , she changed direction once more . If those other boats would only get up they could corner it ! He glanced helplessly in their direction . The nearest boats had stopped to pick up the men in the water . One was hauling in a man whose glinting leg bone had been stripped of flesh by the plunge from the searing heat of the explosion into the water . " Lay on those oars , damn you ! " yelled Lieutenant Fitzpatrick . The oarsmen did not hear him . They were semi-conscious under the desperation of their sustained effort . Their faces were red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaved at each stroke as if it were the last act of their lives . Lieutenant Fitzpatrick fixed his gaze in an agony of intensity on the small surface-steering-wheel , swinging helplessly  | first one way and then the other , on the deserted deck of that grey death-trap fleeing through the muddy water . . . If he watched its swing he might get an idea which way the thing was going to turn . . . it was getting farther and farther away ... I f only he could get a man at that wheel ! As if the fury of the wish he shot along his gaze at that forlorn little steering-wheel had a power too strong for reality and fate to resist , an apparition , a long , distorted object of blood and rags , and flesh that looked unreal in the sunlight , rose from the hatch of the submarine and crawled fumblingly on all fours to the steering post . Grasping the spokes of the wheel , it pulled itself upright , a horrible caricature sharply outlined against the luminous background of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous gesture as if bracing itself for an ordeal ; then it swung the wheel and the submarine headed for the breakwater . A veritable scream of relief rose from the boats struggling to come up with him . Those nearest him shouted his name in frantic encouragement : " Straight ahead , Mr. Schiff ! " . . . " Stay with it , Schiff , old boy ! " ... " Schiff ... " Ensign Schiff did " stay with it . " He stayed there at that wheel , a tall , gaunt figure , stiff and appalling , and steered his vessel through the breakwater entrance and straight at the Submarine Dock , steered her on and on in some miraculous fashion , the soiled , glistening skull his youthful head had become , in which only the aquiline nose still seemed to live , bent far back so that the eye sockets were aimed rigidly , sightlessly up into the topmost depths of the glaring and pitiless sunshine . The crowd of watchers lining the shore-lines of the Base , and those in the welter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally crashed bow on into the Submarine Dock , grunted as if they had been a single individual struck violently in the stomach . Those on the dock grappled the submarine and made her fast . Then , for an instant , the rush aboard her of a Rescue Party was checked by the stench , acrid , fleshy , nauseating , that poured from the hole in that steel maw . In that instant , Ensign Schiff turned , holding onto the wheel behind him with one hand , and said to the people on  | the dock , speaking as a man speaks who has fought to hold his breath for a long time : " Batteries . . . hydrogen . . . Get the men out please . " Then he swung slowly about and faced in the direction of the bungalow , not far away , where he lived with his wife , It seemed for a moment as if he were about to walk off in that direction right across the intervening strip of water ; but instead he sank reluctantly to his knees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odious thing that had been his arm . 12 For the Captain , Mendel 's death was an item of unequivocal defeat . There was one man Delilah never could get back , They would beat him there ; be able to , have to give him a new man to replace him . It was not a fair defeat though . It was as if he had been standing fist to fist with an opponent and the referee had slipped in a blow from behind . It made him restless , so restless that he spent the day after the accident goading along the work on his ship in an effort to reduce the period in which such things could happen . He must manage to get to the point , as soon as possible , where the ship all came back together again . There was trying to arise in his mind a vague , irritating conviction that forces beyond his control , even beyond his contact , were eating around the edges of his plans and his purpose . He was struggling unself-consciously against this conviction when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing a letter to Mendel 's mother in New York regarding the manner of his death . He wrote the letter very rapidly , almost mechanically , to the tempo , as it were , of the current of thoughts running below those concerned with the letter . .. He had two more men in those submarines . . . he was going to get them back ... get them back right now ! ... He had not figured on this kind of sniping . . . He made a restless error with his fountain pen , spoiling the letter , when another idea clotted this current of thought , a kind of idea particularly repugnant to the essence of his personality , the kind of thing he objectively  | would have regarded as hysterical nonsense : It was queer under the circumstances that it had to be one of his men that was killed , was the substance of what had risen in his thinking . " But , hell ... had n't eight other men been killed too ! " he had instantly reprimanded himself as he laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he had read what he so far had written , he knew that he would have to write an entirely different letter . What he had written was true enough ; but what that woman would want was something definite and comforting about the way he died . He could make it definite enough , he assured himself , " but there was nothing comforting about it ... being blown to smithereens into the water and dying hard there for ten minutes . . . this was a tough one . " What vaguely but cogently complicated the difficulty of writing the letter was his remembered impression of Mendel about the ship , as if from this impression there was reflected to him some disturbing hint of qualities where his letter would be received that peculiarly incapacitated him as the writer of the letter . Ile would have found himself at a loss in writing such a letter to the mother of any of his men ; but to Mendel 's mother the effort became mysteriously more difficult . He strove to envision the mother reading this letter , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there rose in his perceptions the figure of the only mother of any kind he really ever had known as such , his own . He could guess uncomfortably at what to say to this woman , this firm-fleshed angular woman of English-Scotch ancestry whose controlled , reticent spirit had patterned his boyhood ; and he took up the pen again to say it ... to say it to a short , swarthy , obese woman , into whose great , moist , black eyes , complaining and ever on the alert for misery , there flooded , at the slightest release , all the frank power of her emotions . . . to say on a piece of paper words about the death of her son , the son , an appendage of her body , like one of her breasts , whom a ruthless God had given her to immerse in a dank and exhaustive maternity . . . words on a piece of paper telling the wrath of the God she so long had propitiated , . . propitiated standing beside her mother in the gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | tortured with emotion , at the shawled male heads below that swayed rhythmically before the passionate , masochistic lash of the rabbi , who intoned with inspired detail the insults , the injuries that preserved their nationalism of ignominious pain , intoned it until her mother , who had seen pogroms in the Balkans , sobbed so terribly that she disturbed the service and had to be helped out by the Shamus into the street . . . a piece of paper that began : " Dear Mrs. Mendel : This is a hard letter to have to write to you . By now the Navy Department will have informed you of your son 's death out here in the line of duty . As his Commanding Officer , I thought you would like to know something more personal about it , and that we did the best we could for him . " As he poised the fountain pen for the next paragraph , he shifted his body with dissatisfaction , shoved the butt of the pen through the unruly area of his sandy hair . He was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was writing was as dry as dust . . . that boy was probably the apple of her eye .. . " He was a fine , clean boy and served his country bravely to the end like a true American . And I can only say to you that we liked him and hated to lose him and I feel the deepest sympathy for you in your terrible loss . " We have carefully gotten his things together and will send them to the Navy Department , which will forward them to you . He would have been promoted soon because he was intelligent and never neglected his duty . " Now for the hard part . . . this is what she really wants to know . . . where were those eye-glasses ... He located them and put them on . . . What a thing to have to tell a boy 's mother ! ... He wrote : " Your son was assigned temporarily for a few day 's duty on the submarine . On its way out for manoeuvres an explo-  | sion occurred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the water , where he died before a boat picked him up . " It is small comfort to you , who have lost a son , to say that the manner of his passing on has aroused the greatest admiration in all who know him . I wish there was something I could say to comfort you . All I can say is that you and your family have the deepest sympathy of the officers and men of this ship amongst whom he lived and served his country . " The Captain read the letter over . It occurred to him to show it to Lieutenant Fitzpatrick ; but almost immediately he rejected this impulse . He read it over again ; then his small blue eyes stared hard at the paragraph about the manner of Mendel 's death , stared at it as if for some reason he was not seeing it . He started to call in the Yeoman to have the letter copied on the typewriter . No . . . he had decided in the first place that it had to be written personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He still was staring at that paragraph . Then with a kind of finality he laid the letter down on the desk again and picked up the pen to correct it . . . He would correct it . . . and copy it over himself . With an abrupt gesture he took off his spectacles . He changed the words " was blown " to " got " and put the word " instantly " after " died . " As he recopied the letter , however , he wrote : " almost instantly . " It certainly was true that O'Connel , for one , had been filled with admiration and a kind of exultant sadness by Mendel 's death . This was apparent when he and Warrington had returned back aboard Delilah , returned as a result of the Captain 's insistence at the Personnel Office that he now needed them and the submarines did not , those craft having been laid up for alterations in an effort to preclude another disaster . Warrington , on the other hand , had not yet developed any poignant memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , an abstraction illumined by a general pity that at one moment was intense and at another almost theoretical . His feelings were claimed preponderantly by a kind of heavy relief at being back aboard the ship ; and the appreciation , the admiration that arose in him whenever his consciousness was corn-  | pletely caught by the events of the explosion , was for the magnificence of Ensign Schiff 's effort , an effort by a man he did not know , and which , therefore , he was able to appreciate in essence , an effort that reflected glory on the death of his friend , Mendel ( whom he knew only too well ) , to just about the extent that this death participated in that of Ensign Schiff . He almost smiled at the way O'Connel ( for whom Ensign Schiff 's end was little more than the background , heroic but abstract , for the death of the man that he , O'Connel , knew personally ) carried on about Mendel , at the boisterous persuasiveness with which the Irishman became touched on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardy dye of the big man 's emotion that soon coloured the attitude of all the rest of the ship 's company . Even the blond , stable objectiveness of Cavendish , the Quartermaster , was affected by it . In the first hours after the accident , O'Connel 's mind and emotions had fused three elements that , together as a crystallized whole , became for him Mendel and his elegy : the extraordinary manner in which Ensign Schiff had permitted himself to die only after he had brought in his stricken men , together with the conviction that he , O'Connel , had been Mendel 's recognized friend , had become one with the fact of Mendel 's death in a spectacular disaster . With that remarkable ability available to some people , the Irishman swept out of his consciousness the memory of all the disgust and hatred , all the violence , he up until recently had visited upon Mendel ; and he would have been astonished and indignant if anyone had seen anything inconsistent in his attitude . Standing with an arm thrown around Warrington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost clinging to the Texan as if they two were the survivors of a triumvirate that only such a death could separate . Feenan slowly detected the one unconscious flaw in O'Connel 's attitude , when periodically O'Connel would interject , " He must have had some Irish in him , " and the Oiler , whenever he thought it was safe , would respond , turning away to spit over the side , " Yeh . . . he was different from regular Jews . " Easterly , the Fireman , while he remained susceptible to O'Connel 's influence in this matter because it pointed up  | Mendel 's death , was not concerned with it greatly in its guise of tragic heroism . His main concern with the event seemed to be that it was the source of the unpleasant feeling that kept pawing at his insides , a restless feeling of being humiliatingly unsatisfied . He thought of this feeling simply as anger over his having been treated unjustly ; but he could not get rid of it .. " the sons of bitches . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he kept insisting to himself , " Tried to dive over after him ! ... And they cursed me and socked me . . . and held me in the boat . . . and Fitzpatrick bawled me out . . . made a fool of me ! " He tried to convince himself that if they had not interfered with him he could have saved Mendel 's life ; but his normal critical sense mitigated that conviction with the unquenchable probability that the man was dying when they came up with him in the water . . . But that was not the point , he told himself over and over , it was the idea of the thing . He had tried to dive over to save a man and they had made a fool of him ! Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had reprimanded him , spoken to him sharply and impatiently before most of the ship 's company , while the fires of Easterly 's frustration still were burning brightly . It had been in the moment of release after the whaleboat had pulled back to Delilah 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent , were hunched over on the thwarts , with their arms extended rigidly out at their sides for support . They probably had not paid much attention to the reprimand ; but the men crowding Delilah 's rail had . In order to listen to it they had halted the questions they were firing down at the boat . The others in the whaleboat , those riot at the oars , who were waiting for the officer to be first out , also had listened attentively while Lieutenant Fitzpatrick told Easterly that when he wanted anybody to jump overboard he would give orders to that effect . . . that Easterly had held up the Rescue Party in the first place by losing his oar , and then had thrown everything into confusion by trying to jump overboard like a damn fool ... He ought to put him on the Report ... Next time he was in a boat he was to see to it that he sat tight and obeyed orders . As Lieutenant Fitzpatrick had turned his back and climbed  | up onto Delilah 's deck , Easterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment . He had hated that back more than he ever had hated anybody in the world ; but he had continued to stare at it because there was no face in it , and keeping his eyes there saved him from looking into those other faces lining the rail . " The dirty little punk ! " he had raged to himself , " I 'd like to show him . . . I 'd like to smack him in the mouth . " It seemed to him that he had sat there before that crowd stripped naked , by brutality and injustice , of everything that made him human . It did not occur to him for a second that in their eyes he looked like nothing more nor less than a shipmate who had been rebuked by an officer , appeared as he always appeared , a healthy but hollow-cheeked coal heaver with dark , stringy hair and prominent , square , slightly separated teeth in a wide mouth . It was true that his full lips , which usually had colour , had paled , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a womanish quality , had become drawn and tense . His easy smile had gone for the moment ; but he had the same touch of wild handsomeness about him , had been , for them , the same quite ordinary youth . When Lieutenant Fitzpatrick 's back had disappeared over the rail , Easterly had shifted his eyes into the perspective of smooth , dirty water that led up into the Base ... Why the hell did n't they get away from the rail and let him come up in peace ? . . . He had wanted to dive over after that man . . . the sons of bitches . He appeared to be gazing at the spectacle , in the distance there , of the native workmen on the other destroyers already at their labours again , as if not even death and disaster could halt for long their furious efforts in behalf of some fatal and hidden exigency. 13 The relief of both Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Warrington , over the latter 's return to the ship , was so extensive that , not being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They soon breathed the atmosphere of their reunion as a swimmer might breathe the air an hour or so after rising to the surface from a deep , lung-torturing dive , unconscious that it  | was a boon , that it was a thing whose deficiency had been experienced , a precarious thing to be reckoned with . Shortly the officer found himself spared even the poignancy that at first remained in the memory of the long , violent moment through which he had suffered the false premonition that Warrington was on the wrecked submarine ; and for some reason he found himself thinking : " I had nothing to do with getting him back aboard ... I tried to transfer him . " It had become implicitly clear to him , while Warrington and O'Connel were in the very act of officially reporting back aboard as members of Delilah 's crew , formally lined up before him on the dock with their bags and hammocks , that there now persisted between himself and his friend a barrier that seemed insuperable , an unidentifiable barrier that yet was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , however , never reached the point of envisioning what had brought about this state of affairs : There had been no quarrel : Their relationship simply had encountered a great , passionate , nameless obstacle , on one side of which was himself and on the other Warrington . Warrington , on his part , although his mind seethed continually with a hunt for the cause , never for a moment seemed to attribute his own participation in the result of the implicit quarrel to his feelings over having been transferred . That cruel and curt act , it appeared to him , was not a cause but a consequence ; and he now seemed to perceive that the clearly remembered feeling of finality that had swept him on seeing his name on the transfer list , the feeling that the transfer was to be permanent , really had been a confused realization of the end of their friendship . Neither of them spoke to each other now save in the line of duty . " Hand me the Rough Log Book , " Lieutenant Fitzpatrick would say sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances at the man to whom an order is given . Warrington 's " Aye , Aye , Sir , " would come out in a voice that was detached , almost aggressively prompt , illusively condescending ; or , Warrington being on watch and observing the Captain entering the head of the dock , he would report to Lieutenant Fitzpatrick in much the same manner and tone of voice that the officer had used to him  | in giving an order : " Captain coming aboard , Sir " ; and then the officer , borrowing the repellent quality , but not the forced respect , of the tone in which Warrington had said , " Aye , Aye , Sir , " would pronounce , " Very well , " and , turning his back with pointed casualness , would walk to the gangway to meet the Captain as if Warrington had been merely a slightly annoying bell whose summons had interrupted him . Often the officer struggled with the impulse to recognize the enlisted man 's attitude as contemptuous and insubordinate , and put him on the Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this temptation , succumbing to which would have procured for Warrington a General Court Martial , by telling himself that " the man was begging for it . " On the other hand , he literally would not have dared to make a gesture of reconciliation toward his friend , nor speak the word that would have launched them , in some empty moment of one of the many long , careless days that were smothering them there alongside the dock , on one of the old conversations . Neither could Warrington have made the gesture or spoken the word . He could not have done it if it would have saved him from being hung at the yard-arm . Fortunately for him the disaster to their relationship did not return him completely to the desert of meaningless ordeal that the Navy had been for him up to the moment of their first conversation on the bridge . The very stress between them , largely monopolizing his emotions and reflections , was , in its polarization , a misery rich with significance , as rich , in that sense , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not restore the harmony , he clung to the conflict that still bound them . However , the striking thing was not that they clung to the only bond that still seemed possible to them ; but that , they both actually seemed to be striving to protect and preserve , striving carefully and with a kind of cold desperation , the framework of their tacit quarrel as such . It was as if beneath their consciousnesses some deep prescience was battling , indirectly in the dark of their spirits , to save them from the illumination and strange grace into which an overreaching reconciliation , now , might plunge them .  | The breach between Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Warrington had been noticed neither generally nor importantly by the crew . This probably would not have been the case if Delilah , when the breach occurred , had been in a seagoing way of life , with the crew , as normally , a crowded , close-textured community confined within her and patterned by her routines . As it was , many of the men were gone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovering from alcoholic depressions , lolled in the deceptive shade on the covered dock amidst the clutter of cots , cook-stove , fragments from the gutted ship and glistening torpedoes , or went ashore on more frequent and extended liberty than they usually enjoyed . Of course , there was work for some at odd jobs here and there on the ( lock and in the ship , which they went at in a disconnected manner tinder the pressure of but the one officer left to them . They even sent their laundry out to some Chinaman in Cavite . Their life , apparently , no longer was of a quality that made them susceptible to the minute hints and indices that , when they were at sea together , would have aroused them . It is true that there had been the moment of group surprise when Warrington 's name appeared on the transfer list ; but that , had been swept away by the storm of astonishment , both collective and individual , that had arisen around the incredible way the repair operations had been extended to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all seemed keyed now to the heavy potentialities in these repair operations ; and as a crew they remained almost unresponsive to anything of lower tone . The rapidly decreasing , sporadic fights ashore had quite begun to lose meaning for them as a definite collection of people ; and even the accident to the submarine , with Mendel 's death , had but briefly jogged them from the current of disorganization that , on the one hand , was tending to make of them mere individuals , and from the crosscurrent of mystifying interest that , on the other , still swept them along in a tenuous community of larger curiosity above what formerly had been their concentrated daily life . Once Saunders did notice the manner in which an order was  | given and received between Lieutenant Fitzpatrick and Warrington . His heavy eyebrows had gone up in surprise and he had nudged Cruck , saying : " What the hell 's up between Whoses and Whatses ? " " Aw , I guess they got sore in one of them arguments or something , " Cruck had replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it normally was in this category of event , it is doubtful if Saunders now would have been impelled to do much about it ; and even if he had been impelled , managing to present the anecdote in its most catching form , he no doubt would have found that his item no longer possessed the impact and spread of live gossip . Ensign Woodbridge and Ensign Snell , if they had been present through the development of this situation , might have sensed something a trifle disturbing in it , although the friendship between the Executive Officer and the Seaman never had gotten through , as a clear realization , to either of them . Ensign Woodbridge 's only clue to the existence of some special relationship lay in his having twice interrupted the two , deep in talk about books , in order to relieve Lieutenant Fitzpatrick on the bridge . He had made nothing of it except that Lieutenant Fitzpatrick was being eccentric and that Warrington was some kind of freak ; and he had made nothing else of it simply because such a friendship would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounded , rather than scandalized , if his brother officer had confessed to him how far the association had gone . Neither the Captain nor Ensign Snell could have made him believe it . He would have had to hear it from the lips of Lieutenant Fitzpatrick , himself ; and his feeling at such a confession would have been , in point of astonishment alone , a little like what it would be if he were to hear a friend back in Virginia confess , not to a quite usual deep regard and esteem for a Negro , but to an equal friendship with one . When he had overheard the literary discussion between the officer and the enlisted man , his mind casually had dismissed it as a piece of bizarre nonsense on the officer 's part , a piece of nonsense that did not concern him , Woodbridge . It never would have occurred to him to discuss literature with an enlisted man
