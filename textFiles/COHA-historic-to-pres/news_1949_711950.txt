The United States Conference of Mayors , meeting in Washington , has heard an unusually impressive list of speakers , including the President and some elder statesmen . The Mayors have been brought up to date on international and national issues . Finally and inevitably , however , the talk always gets around to the painful subject of money and taxes . Except for certain large , key problems , which can not be dealt with wisely on the lower , level , we think there is a growing and refreshing tendency to question the wisdom of carrying municipal problems to state capitals for solution , and for the states and cities also to go to Washington . The current session of the New York Legislature supports that view , for there has been a noticeable abstention from wholesale , undiscriminating demands upon the state treasury . General Eisenhower and Bernard Baruch both advised the Mayors in Washington against depending too much on - the Federal Government . " Everybody wants to lean upon the central Government , " said Mr. Baruch , " but who is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower commented upon the temptation to " pass things unnecessarily ' to the Federal Government because thereby they ( local officials ) escape the necessity of levying locally unpopular taxes which may be hard to explain to the voters . " While various factors are at work which warn against too sweeping a generalization , it is instructive to note that as a rule the farther government gets from the people the larger is the tax increase . Federal tax collections rose from $3.3 billion in 1929 to $40 billion in 1948 ; states ' tax collections rose in that period front $2 billion to about *7.9 billion , while local tax collections increased from $4.8 billion in 1929 to roughly $6 billion in 1948 . Everyone is well aware to what extent the Military and European Recovery budget accounts for the Federal Government 's heavy demands on the taxpayer . Yet , with the Federal Government taking 75 cents of every tax dollar , it is obvious where economies must be made if they are to return any substantial benefit to the taxpayer . The problem of overlapping taxes will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , with Washington , the states and cities sitting down together . President Truman brought to the Mayors ' conference the good news that the Secretary of the Treasury will soon invite state and city officials to I meet with him and other federal officials to devise a program to " bring ' some order out of the tangle " in the field of ? taxation and financial relations . This will not be easy . The Federal Government has reached more and more into the local field ; meanwhile twdthirds of the states have taken up the income . tax , and cities are increasingly adopting it or the payroll tax . The Federal Government has not set a good example to the states , either in multiplicity of taxation or economy of operation . As a result , to a certain extent , I states and cities have unfairly become the whipping boys of the public because of federal extravagance . The taxpayer will feel more liberally disposed to his state and city governments when the costliness of the federal establishment is reduced .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
