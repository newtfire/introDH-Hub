ARTICLE VI . - DOCTRINAL CREEDS AS TESTS OF CHURCH MEMBERSHIP . " FATHER " NEWMAN , in that polemic of masterly English , the Apologia pro vita sua , alluding to the sentimental tendencies which he deplored in the Anglican Church , remarks with great force , that if Christia ity is not a dogma it is nothing . We accept this statement . An undoctrinal Christianity would be as powerless as a State without laws , and could command neither the conscience nor the intelligence of the world . At least such a religion would , most decidedly , not be Christianity , which above all faiths possesses the elements of a doctrinal system , and might part as easily with its miracles as with its body of divine truth . So important is this thread of doctrine in the fabric of Christianity , that we can but sympathize , at least , with the general purpose of every attempt to maintain it . We should be slow to attack a custom which had served in the past for the defence of the faith , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfavorable influence on the grounding of our congregations in divine truth . Veteran customs , like veteran soldiers , require a certain amount of reverential treatment after their active usefulness is gone , and it is good for a people to let them die a natural death , and in an honorable way , rather than to be impatient to hasten their decline . These considerations apply to the subject we propose to discuss . The use of doctrinal creeds as tests of church membership is a time-honored custom in the family of churches to which we belong and a custom too which permits us to speak only in admiring terms of the men who dared to adopt it . The doctrinal examinations which were set up in New England for the " trial of the spirits , " were a part of that ideal of a church which never since the day of the apostles was set so high as by our fathers . However burdensome they may be to us , they were freedom to that race of founders , unconscious both of their own greatness and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objectionable such a practice may now be as a rule of perpetual obligation , it expressed then the convictions of the whole community , and was probably the only way in which their cherished ideas could operate with freedom ; and as to the harmful elements of the m ethoa , to which we have grown so sensitive , the condition of things at the time rendered them to all intents inoperative . All this which has been said above is , however , entirely consistent with the conviction which we entertain , that there is something both essentially and practically wrong in these doctrinal examinations of applicants at the door of the church . We believe that the continuation of this practice would be unfavorable to the maintenance of that high standard of intelligent and orthodox belief of which it is supposed by many to be a solid support . It may be that in the transformations which social and religions life undergo in the process of time , the ancient custom is not working as it once did . It may be that the present condition of things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more plainly . At all events , we believe that the practice to which we refer is both objectionable in itself , and injurious to the faith of the people , and we propose to show the grounds on which this conviction rests . It may have a strange sound to some ears to be told that these ancient defences of orthodoxy endanger the cause they were designed to promote . We believe it can be shown that they do . Not that creeds are useless or mischievous in themselves . We believe in creeds , and in systematic doctrine , and in the noble science of theology . Christendom deeply needs the aid which is to be obtained from these sources , and we say once for all that we yield to none in our conception of the importance and prominence which is to be given to such things as these in the right administration of a Congregational church . But we protest against the practice of requiring assent to any system of doctrine , whether longer or shorter , as a condition precedent to admission into the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do so advisedly , for we wish our readers to know accurately to what we object . There is something doctrinal in the simplest faith in Christ . In a sense , Christ himself is a doctrine , as , for ex // ample , in the compendious saying " I am the truth . " Some doctrinal contents must therefore be required in the simplest confession which faith can make or which can be recognized as complying with the scriptural terms of admission to a church . But doctrine implied in the received facts of a living faith , is something very different from a longer or shorter compendium of systematic theology , and very different too from those terse and sententious Articles of Faith which , however brief they are , present the system in a nut shell . The shortest of them all is a multum in parvo which does not end its abbreviated round until it has touched on the deepest questions of the human mind , and given in the turn of a word a theoretic view of matters which the wisest theologians still continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the doubt-breeding suggestions , the brain-trying contentions , the " strong food " for those who are " able , " still remain undiluted and concentrated in those compact concretes . From the nature of the case they are unfit to serve the purpose which their title proclaims unless , even in their brevity , they are comprehensive and exhaustive Articles of Faith , presenting a systematic view of the doctrines of grace . The creeds which our churches actually offer to young converts , are not always so thorough and systematic as a compend of doctrine should be . They sometimes take great liberties with the " faith as once delivered . " Under cover of advancing only what is essential , they amend and omit , to suit the notions of the brethren , who then demand assent to the fragments which compose the remainder . But this well sifted remainder , with all its suppression of truth and ingenious avoidance of danger , flaunts the old name and remains a system of doctrinal belief ; and while it is no fair representation of revealed truth and merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or nothing for a test of membership . We raise our voice against admission on any such terms . Assent to a body of doctrine , long or short , complete or in fragments , embracing essentials or selected to suit the people-we object to the whole scheme of admission on such terms ; not because creeds are useless in themselves and have no office in the ministry of the church , but because the true and divine // test of membership is not assent to a body of doctrine of any kind . The personal qualifications required in the New Testament do indeed involve the elements of a doctrinal belief ; but such a test is far different from that which is now in our communion the favorite plan for the preservation of orthodoxy . The church must have its confession of faith , and use it too . But that confession is designed for a better work than that of a sentinel to bar the door . It is the authorized compendium of doctrine . It is designed to furnish a carefully prepared statement of what is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , aid , and support the teaching and the preaching . We do not consider that a people can be made orthodox by a few words more or less in the manual , but only as the revealed word is incorporated into them . We are writing in the interest of a solid and intelligent orthodoxy , not in any unfriendliness to the doctrinal influence nor in any impatience of its restraints . The churches ought to be founded strongly on Articles of Faith . We only wish the work were more thoroughly done , as it would be were it not that the common use of these Articles as terms of admission has obscured their true office and made it necessary to simplify and pare them down to a kind of average or compromise line in order to make them fit to be tolerated in the introduction of new members . It is both mortifying and alarming to observe how this practice has mutilated the confessions of our churches , and given them in many cases a character and a purpose wholly different from what they once had and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several branches of the Protestant family originally made their start were designed to declare what each church as such taught and believed . These confessions were not at all related to the question of the admission of members . They were prepared by the highest and most learned minds as the doctrinal foundation of the church , and as the epitome of its belief and preaching . In the case of the English Puritans and the Scotch Presbyterians they took the form of a catechism , and in the case of the Church of England they were shaped into the Thirty-nine Articles . In the Congregational order each church has its own Articles , but the theory of their use and character remains the same . // They do not represent the minimum of faith which is essential to salvation and the terms on which admission is granted . On the contrary , they represent ( or by the theory ought to represent ) the ripest and most advanced statement of the truth of God which the best and most illuminated minds of the church can frame into words . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine which many of these early churches set forth , and he will see at a glance what these confessions were designed to be and how far the modern idea has sunk . The average mind in our congregations , at the present time , would seem to have almost no other conception of the use of the socalled Articles of Faith than that of a test formulary for the admission of members . The majority of our recent creeds have becn drawn with the view of constructing a formula of things absolutely essential in the system of Christian truth , assent to which might be required of all candidates without scandal . This use , in which the new view destines the creeds of the church to serve as tests for admission , has gradually shrunk their dimensions as exhibitions of doctrine and at the same time impaired their value as compendious statements of system - atic truth . The result is that the churches in which these ideas have prevailed are , as it were , sailing under bare poles , with compromise Articles of Faith , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , to describe what they preach and teach . A striking instance of this is in the Articles of the Seminary church at Andover . We should expect there a full and careful confession . A church composed largely of professors instructing in theology and of young men preparing for the ministry , would have , we should say , a confession of faith which it would repay one to study , and which would furnish a form of sound words for the benefit of all our congregations . But unfortunately the ancient conception of the office of the church confession has so far passed away that even Andover must set an example in the new style , and lead off with a minimum creed . The strongest thing it asserts about baptism , for instance , is that it is the privilege of parents to consecrate their // children in this way . What are we to understand by this ? Is this the doctrine taught at Andover-that infant baptism is the privilege of Christian parents , and that those who desire to practice it shall have liberty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framed to be a test of admission , a formulary for candidates to take into their mouths , not to be a compendium of doctrine to be preached from the pulpit . Instead of giving us a doctrine of infant baptism , it evades the point , implies that there is no real doctrine in the case , and , to guide those who think there is , promulgates a kind of concordat which shall give them security in the practice of their faith . We do not discover in this conspicuous example an evidence that Andover is declining from the faith . We borrow no trouble on that point . Her Seminary church is organized on a kind of catechism for very young children , not because it is tainted with heresy , or impatient of the yoke of doctrine , but because the brethren there have yielded to the mischievous opinion that the doctrinal confession is to prove who are worthy , and having accepted this opinion wished to set a liberal example . As long as a mistaken practice coutinues to nail up the confession on the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot away its Articles one by one . There is a deep and powerful conviction in the hearts of religious people that every true disciple has an eternal right to be in the church , and if creeds are to decide who shall come in , these creeds must gradually shrink until they offer no resistance to any who " profess and call themselves Christians . " As long as the fundamental Articles of the church are used in this way , the desire to frame them so that no regenerate disciple shall be excluded , will operate to create and keep alive the disposition to reduce the confessions . There will be no end to this process as long as any thing like a body of doctrine stands between the convert and the door of the church . The process , which has already begun , will continue until the churches are stript of their fundamental confessions , have lost their doctrinal culture , and are left in a semi-viscid state , with no good bones in their frame . // In the midst of the grand confusion which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled for refuge to the so-called Apostles Creed  --  a document not only unfit for such use , but which was not even designed for it , and which , however well it might serve in the admission of members , would be poor and meagre as a setting forth of that system of divine truth which the church is ordained to teach and to preach . The problem to invent a creed which shall sum up the doctrines of grace and at the same time be a test of admission , which shall require every essential element of revealed truth and exclude no regenerate disciple , is as incapable of solution as the quadrature of the circle . The doctrinal Articles are not for such use . They are Articles of fundamental ecclesiastical constitution . They declare the faith and teaching of the church as a church . They are to be used catechetically , and as the full , ripe , maximum expression of the system of Christian truth . They should be drawn carefully , broadly , not as if crowded for time or space , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the church should stand on them , entrenched in them . Any such variations from this principle as those now under consideration must in the end defeat their object , and result disastrously against the maintenance of orthodox opinion in the church . A yet more serious objection against the practice in question is that it is an infraction of the charter of the Church as given by its divine Founder . The circumstances connected with the actual foundation of the Church by our Saviour appear to be in some respects obscure . High Churchmen in all denominations contest the point , but we have never seen reason to believe that any one form of ecclesiastical polity is clearly and decisively revealed in the Scriptures . In a general sense , which would not be likely to disturb the equanimity of other denominations , we hold our own order to be the most scriptural of all . There are facts recorded in the New Testament which have a very Congregational look , and that there must be passages there with something in them very like a Presbyterial or an Episcopalian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to believe . Our credo is that Christ founded // what may be called the Church Catholic  --  the Church of the covenants , promises and sacraments  --  the Church which is in communion with Him and has fellowship one with another ; and left the church local to develop itself and take on its own ecclesiastical polity at its own free wilL The divine foundation of the Church is not unlike that of the State  --  the command for a state , for a condition of law and order and of civilized society , is given with divine authority ; but the republic , the democracy , the monarchy , the empire , or any legitimate form of political power that is yet to arise , is left to shape itself freely . So in the Church there is what may be called the local church  --  the church localized in its diocese with its own political ( ecclesiastical ) forms , and with the right conceded to it of making them . The divine law of the founder does not prescribe what these forms shall be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church shall be exercised . But the law of membership in the Church Catholic , and the terms of communion and of covenant privilege he has most distinctly set forth . It is with these privileges that we have now to do . We do not at this moment discuss the terms on which what may be called the political rights of church membership are to be conferred . It may appear that a very different set of considerations apply to such a matter as this , and that every church has a jurisdiction here which will so far alter the complexion of the case as to require new terms of citizenship . On this point more may be said hereafter . For the present it is enough to know that Christ has founded what may be called a Church Catholic , of covenant promise , of sacramental privilege , and of spiritual hope and communion in Him . This Church Catholic is the core of every true church of whatever denomination , and under the laws of whatever superadded polity it may be administered . The heart of every church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church Catholic privilege which it has undertaken to administer . This Church Catholic , with its covenant , its sacraments , its hopes and its communion in Christ , has certain eternal laws which are not of human origin , and which are not subject to human amendment . It may excite the wonder of some that our Lord left the kind of polity in which this Church Catholic of His was // to be clothed , and under which it was to be administered , to grow up freely and develop into many different forms . It appears to be no less a new thing to be cried in the hearing of others , that under all these varying forms of church polity there is a sacred and eternal foundation which is of more worth than all the rest , which contains in it the real and essential privileges of the Church , and which has the terms on which those privileges are to be enjoyed inscribed on it by the band of its divine Founder . There is no law of which we have ever heard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from enlarging or contracting the terms on which its ecclesiastical citizenship shall be enjoyed . But back of all and the really important and vital centre of all , is the Church of covenant promise and privilege of sacramental observance and of spiritual communion with Christ , whose code no man has permission to enlarge or contract , and in which every regenerate disciple of Christ has a certain inalienalMe and eternal right to belong . It is the great injustice of doctrinal test creeds that they attack this right and proceed on the unfounded assumption that the local church  --  the organized political body of ecclesiastical membership-like human states or human society , has something to say on the question who shall compose it . This is precisely what the divine Head of the Church has not conceded to its members . Were this right possessed by the brethren , it would be a strictly human society . It is a divine society , because a divine law has fixed the terms of its membership , and because its members are qualified and elected by the choice of divine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covenant Church of Christ which brings with it no political right of government or action in a local church . For example , in early times the eunuch baptized by Philip seems to have been a member of this kind ; and in our day , women and children . The human polity has not conferred politico-ecclesiastical power on these members , but the divine grace which regenerated them qualified them for a place in the Church Catholic of covenant privilege and of communion with Christ . The divine teaching on these points would seem to be conclusive . What our Saviour taught in this regard is known to // us from three sources of evidence-ist , from his own words on several distinct occasions , 2d , from the remarks of the apostles on the subject , and 3d , from their practice . There is a remarkable agreement in the evidence from all these sources . First , our Saviour left explicit assurances that all who repented , believed , and were baptized should be saved , and equally explicit declarations that his embodied people should consist of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the saved estate . Those who belonged to it were his people . Repentance and faith were the spiritual qualifications which implied a new-born man . Baptism was the outward act of confession by which the regenerate believer entered into covenant relations with the new community . It is idle to say that no reference to church membership is had in these passages . The baptism settles that point . The baptism was the initiatory ordinance . The baptized were the church members . The new community was no doubt loosely organized . They were held together by nothing stronger than the ties of sacramental union and covenant grace and hope . The political organization of the church  --  or if this phrase displeases-the organization of the church as an ecclesiastical polity , had not yet begun . It was simply the Church Catholic of the covenants , promises and sacraments as it came from the hand of Christ . To such fellowship the eunuch baptized by Philip was admitted . The question whether he would have been entitled by his simple baptism to the political rights of government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purely hypothetical question , - of a class with puzzles , to be decided on insufficient evidence , whose solution may be remitted to those who are fond of such things . The important fact is that the baptism did admit him to the covenant privileges of the Church of Christ , and although this example is taken from apostolic practice , it is one which reveals with startling vividness the impression which the disciples who surrounded the Saviour had received as to the composition of his Church . They heard the solemn command of the Saviour in the closing scene of his life , and , whatever we may have failed to discover in it , they saw there a charter conferred on the Church , // by which baptism and admission to covenant privileges ( with political or ecclesiastical privileges it had nothing to do ) were assured to all who should repent and believe and confess the Saviour ' s name . Turning to the utterances of the apostles , they are found to be wholly in the same tenor . Repent and believe , were every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words they promulgated the free charter of the Church . So clear and decided on this point is the concurrent opinion of the best scholarship as to require no farther enlargement We only add that whatever variation there may have been in the doctrine preached by the several apostles-whatever personal peculiarities of method or private shading of each one 's work with the color of his own individuality , an absolute and coincident uniformity throughout marks what they say on the question before us . The same conclusion confronts us when we examine the apostles ' practice . The book of the Acts contains , among many others bearing on the question , one account of an entirely exceptional significance . Peter , who appears in the epistles of Paul as the apostle of conservatism , was called down to Joppa to see Cornelius , the Roman Centurion , and decide on his fitness to be received into the Christian community . He received him , that is , baptized him . When he came back to Jerusalem a great storm was blowing around him . There were some believers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had the inveterate prejudice of a Jewish education in favor of the ancient and consecrated rite of circumcision , and supposed it must of course be included in the terms of Christian communionprecisely as some have assumed a Calvinistic belieg or a sound doctrinal creed , or a prohibition of dancing , of wine and cards and theater and opera and games , into their terms of admission - precisely as some Presbyterian people in Pennsylvania did not want one of their elders among them because he could not consider Rouse 's version of the Psalms of David inspired . But Peter held his ground against his critics and beat them in the public discussion , and beat them on this presentation of the case ; that God had conferred his Spirit on Cornelius without circumcision , solely on the ground of his faith and repentance. // " What was I , " then said Peter , " that I should withstand God . " The meaning of all this is that he saw in the seal of the descending Spirit that repentance and faith had made Cornelius a regenerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not venture on the impious audacity of withholding baptism into the covenant relations of the Church to him who had been thus sealed . With this case before ns , and in view of the very clear settlement it contains of the question now under review , we must be pardoned for thinking , that if the brethren who adhere so firmly to the epitome of doctrine as a test of admission imagine themselves to be serving God by the means , it must be in " the way which they call heresy . " It has not been sufficiently considered how far the church belongs to Christ and not to its own members . Independency has its dangers ; and this among them , of treating the local church as the creation and possession of its own members . Here are the Articles of Faith . Here are the rules and by-laws . Here is the capitulation , which like a grand surrendry makes everything over into the hands of the brethren : " The above Articles may be altered by a three-fourths vote in any regular meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this the brethren proceed to enact their will and to incorporate their ideas . They go to work like a religious society laying or repairing their foundation , or administering their self-made organization . They will claim that the church is a divind institution-but in their view , the divinity of it lies in the fact that the members have in themselves individually a regenerate divine life , rather than that there is any eternal charter beneath it forever fixed and given from on high . They hold to a kind of superinduced or consequent divinity flowing into their own work and organization in fulfillment of promise , rather than to any original sacredness inhering in a constitution given once for all with divine authority , and which is the grand distinction of the church as it stands amid all other institutions on earth . There is room enongh in every rightly organized church for a free life to act in , and clothe itself with its own individuality . There is open before every local , diocesan , or national church , a // sphere of politico-ecclesiastical organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have full play . But beneath all , and forming the vitalizing centre of everything else , is the divine foundation of the Sayiour with its covenant , its sacraments , its promises and hopes , and its chartered freedom . The local church is but the ark made by human hands , and after human patterns , to hold and administer the eternal law of the covenant and testimony . Our brethren must not consider it the voice of an enemy , nor of a fault-finding friend , when we say that there has been among us far too much construction of sheep-folds on ideas of our own . The pattern showed in the mount has not been always exhibited in the " regular quarterly meetings for business . " It will be said that it would not always be convenient to place membership on the simple basis of the gospel . No matter . It is placed there . It may be said , it is not expedient ; but who shall decide the question of expediency . It is said that temperance and even abstinence are Christian duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanities of the world . Very well , say so ; preach these things . This is a voice for the pulpit and not for the creed . Do not put this into the terms of admission . Certain it is that the plan of placing every high requirement in the terms of admission has not kept the practices they were designed to repress out of the church . The custom has inflamed many fair minds against the whole subject of religion . Sftch measures are justly considered a kind of usurpation , and as such repudiated . Removed from the falsely assumed place of the test creed into the earnest and bible preaching of the pulpit , they would at least receive a more respectful attention , and even if they failed to subdue the worldly practice , would command the suifrages of every approachable conscience . The moment a church says , we find Calvinism in the Bible , and you must find it there or you can not enter-we find total abstinence and a prohibitory law , and the rite of circumcision , and you must find those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it circumcises itself from the Church Catholic of Jesus Christ , and stands off the chartered foundation of the divine founder . Its members may continue to hope in the promises made to private or individual // faith , but they are not gathered in the Church of the eternal covenant of God . There is one more point of view from which we wish to review this question . How does the light of our own history lie on it ? The doctrinal test has been in operation among us for a sufficiently long period to have come now to its ultimate conclusions And the query arises whether the results of the plan have been such as to commend it . The churches of New England started in their course with a vigorous orthodoxy which was sufficient of itself to assure them a long career untroubled by powerful dissent We can not see in the records of their affairs cvidence that in the first century a considerable influence of any kind was had on the people by the form of church administration . The great thing that stands out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period of original vigor when the polity does not mould the people , but the people mould the polity . Their ecclesiastical order was a matter they very much discussed , but always , it would seem , with the purpose uppermost of making the least possible of it . It was a light clothing which we scarcely notice at all in studying the membership of sturdy believers who wore it . And to find the orthodox vigor of those years in the doctrinal creeds , with which many of the leading churches here and there were furnished , would be a belittling treatment of the years of noble origin . But notwithstanding all , New England has certainly had its fair share of dissent . The most powerful resistance which this country has witnessed to the evangelical doctrine arose inside the doors which were guarded with every sentinel that a doctrinal creed could station there . We are aware that this fact has sometimes been met with the averment that the churches of that day were organized under covenants only , and that heresy crept in by the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases this may have been true  --  but not always-not in the majority of cases with which we have been acquainted . Sometimes , where there was no written creed , the churches , instead of taking advantage of this as an occasion for laxity , used their liberty to such effect that the candidates for admission received an amount of examination in doctrinal belief in comparison with which a subscription // to the longer catechism would be a merciful relief . The fact , we believe , must stand that our churches have as a body made a vigorous use of the doctrinal test in one form or another , aud reposed a confidence in it which is unwarranted by the results . The Unitarian schism was not an outside attack . It arose within churches which were surrounded with all the protection that this armor could afford , and it not only divided them , but in many instances carried them away from the orthodox name . Opinion will not be bound by such cords . To keep the church steady , a method must be pursued which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mobile age great allowance must be made for change . It is not safe to assume that the young convert who could subscribe the test last year can do so now ; and conscience holds to a law of freedom which is not ruled by the past . If a man has changed his mind , he can not be dragged back by reproaching him with apostacy . The vows which held him to the old position were part of his standing at the time , and fell off when that was abandoned . The past history of the churches , and their present position under the working of these doctrinal tests should admonish us how little reliance is to be placed on such safeguards . The age almost laughs at them as they stand at the door impotent  --  but not untroublesome to friends-vainly assuming the guardianship of the flock  --  a spectacle fit to recall what once we saw  --  a wide domain of pasture surrounded by a fallen wall , but with five strong bars across the entrance , to give a sense of security to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds were safe . The historical aspect of the discussion throws also some light on the answer which a sound expediency would give in this case . There is great trouble under the present practice . We have already pointed out the vacillating , uncertain policy to which it has reduced the churches . The best and most highly sensitive minds , minds of the class in which honorable sentiments are likely to arise , are uneasy and do not know what to do next . The churches have yielded one point and another , only to find themselves on a course which will not end . They have invented the phrase " You accept this for substance of // doctrine , " and nursed it dry of all the comfort it contains . They have shortened the creeds , expurgated the creeds , softened the creeds , and run through the scale of possible variation . But the troubled feeling remains that something is wrong . They have worked down to the bed-rock of the system , and it is not the right kind of rock . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , and that Church will not rest until the change is made which would bring it back to repose on the eternal foundation of repentance and faith and the public confession implied in baptism . We must accept boldly the principle that the Church is the home of all Christians-that every regenerate believer has an essential right to its communion , and that we can not be right until we open the door to all " who confess and call themselves Christians . " The governing body of the local church or the voting and administering body of brethren , have a right to be satisfied that those who apply have good reason to show for claiming the Christian name . The example of the Apostolic Church agrees with the dictates of good sense in defending the practice of inquiring into the candidate 's grounds of hope , and the evidence he can give that he is a converted believer in Christ . The views he entertains of divine truth , of the person of the Redeemer , of the way of salvation , and of the duty and destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit in which he stands toward such matters as these , may justly be taken into consideration , for they shed light on the main question . But it is only as they do this that they are relevant in the inquiry . They are impertinent intrusions when they only lead up to the question , Can this applicant be said to concur in the doctrinal system professed in our Articles of Faith . These examinations have been too long conducted on this mistaken plan , and the results , we repeat , are not such as to commend their continuation . For another example of the working of things under this plan , look at the confusion which prevails in the practice of our ministers in the invitation to the Lord 's Supper . Let no one imagine that these variations arise without a cause . Every turn of the sentences used in such cases ex - presses an endeavor to adjust the church to the opposite sides // of the contradictory problem in hand . One invites " all who love the Lord Jesus , " or in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to wrong the church by the assumption of unauthorized power , and by slighting the divine requirement of a confession founded on baptism and actual admission . Another invites all who belong to the church of Christ , and as he does it , thinks perhaps , of the " outside saints " excluded from the flock by the test of that system of doctrine which it is his gladdening duty to preach , but which was never appointed to be the terms of admission . The light of discussion has so far fallen on the minister that he feels the force of such views as we have presented in their application to the privileges of the Lord 's Table ; but , perhaps , their full application to the spring of all the difficulty , to the terms of admission to the church , has not yet been disclosed to him . There he stands attempting the impossible , searching for some form of cunning words that shall give his rights to Cornelius without high treason against the church . On the whole , we are glad that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required formulary , nor to conceal with an ingenious sentence the essential oppugnation of things which exists in the present state of the case . But is there no other side to this question ? Are there no strong reasons to be given for persevering with such unanimity in the policy which has now become historical in our churches ? Certainly there are , and we would not even seem to treat them with trifling consideration . When we remember the great force and the obvious nature of the objections which have frequently been raised against the practice in question , both by friends inside of the denomination and by Christians of other names actuated perhaps in some cases by a spirit of rivalry , we can not shut our eyes to the fact that the ancient policy must be held in place by considerations that are very strong indeed ; or by the dread of attempting a change which is surrounded with perils of unknown difficulty . What these difficulties and these considerations are , we will not now attempt to de3cribe . We may say in a general way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it can part so easily with its burdens ; and that the traditional // mistakes of the past do not commit it to an eternal repetition of them . We have confidence in the general adaptability and elasticity of Congregationalism to free itself of everything and anything which is seen to be an incumbrance . Our " household of faith " has grown into the present state of this matter and it must grow out of it . Sudden change is not desirable , and not possible . The process is already going on . The experiment of shortening and diluting the creeds and bringing them down to minimum proportions and to the character of a catechism for young children , though we have raised our voice against it , must after all be characterized as a blind movement toward the light . Mach intelligent work is going on . Much thought and discussion is directed to the subject . Many candid minds are continually feeling over the ground . There is too much wisdom in the ministry to allow the churches to be shaken by convulsive changes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne too long , and by many with too little sense of its greatness , to make it a case in which patience ceases to be a virtue . Some attempts to reach the case have been made which seem to require at least an allusion . We say nothing of the abbreviation or simplification of test creeds , for the reason that when such work is ended it only reduces the amount of poison in the cup . Some have gone more boldly to work and left the articles of belief in position , as fundamental doctrines on which the church is to stand , but abolished their use as tests , and annexed to them some simpler form of admission , drawn as nearly as possible in accordance with the fundamental charter of the Christian Church . Others have used these articles only as the guide and support of faith , but , requiring no farther assent to them than that developed in the examination of the candidate before the church or its officers , have directed their inquiries to the simple end of finding good reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ . The public confession and admission to covenant privileges is thus founded on the results of such previous inquiry , and not on the very barren fact that the candidate has been willing to stand up in the church and nod in assent to a longer or shorter digest of evangelical doctrine . // The amount of change required to bring our churches under the operation of such a method of admission as this last is very slight . We know of ministers who , in the use of that official power which Congregationalism in book and journal , and on the platform , is always denying that it possesses , and which the churches are as steadily allowing to be practiced , have made the change nemgne contradieertte . But when such change is accomplished there comes into view a peril which every thorough student of this question must be familiar with . Does not such a course open the door to laxity ? Would it not admit into the government of the church itself a body whose orthodoxy is but half formed , and who because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsafe to trust , and who might even overturn the foundations of the church itself ? These are inquiries which we have no disposition to slight . In our judgment they bring into view the real core of the solid objection which may be made to the views we have advanced . As far , however , as they relate to the introduction of laxity and the corruption of personal faith , we conceive that enough has already been said to quiet that fear  --  or at least to quiet it as far as it can be quieted under any system at all . It is probably a danger that exists in the nature of the case and can not be removed , but only diminished and guarded . The safety of the church lies , in part , in cherishing the fear and in deriving from it an incitement to vigilance and faithful administration . The danger to which it refers has its seat , however , in the human mind more than in the kind of statute by which the church seeks to control its members . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its central life and power , not so much by force of uniform opinion , as by virtue of the divine and regenerate life of its members in Him . The New Testament , and especially tho Book of the Acts , displays a sublime trust in the unifying and all controlling power of the practical principle of regenerate and regenerating faith . Doctrine is worth much to feed , guide and support this faith ; doctrinal examination is worth much to discover and verify it . But the great clue to guide a soul to the church , the cord to attach it to it , and the principle // to fit it to abide there , is this faith in Christ . Therefore the apostles trusted it with a sublime and single confidence . Therefore let us trust it too . There is nothing in anything without it . With it the church will sail through its troubles and abide in purity and strength . The governmental peril however remains , and requires , as we freely admit , some more thorough consideration than we are now prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , by their democratic organization , are peculiarly exposed to . The Congregational denomination , when it opens its communion to a believer , gives him ( with the exception in some cases of women and minors ) political rights in the church . We have not made that distinction between what may be called the covenant rights of the Church Catholic and the political rights of the church local which in most of the denominations is so carefully guarded . With the exception made above ; a Congregational church member is invested with ecclesiastical power and becomes a church ruler . He votes on all questions . As the matter now stands , he has an influence in framing the Articles of Faith . It would certainly be an act of sublime confidence in the simple principle of faith for any church to commit all its powers to those whose one qualification to administer them is this , It may prove in practice that such universal suffrage in the kingdom of God is the true policy . But should it be found that such a liberal policy would endanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to prevent the separation being made between the covenant rights of membership in the Church Catholic and the political rights which would then be conferred by the local church on a mere limited body whom they conceive to be qualified to wield them . In fact , the traditional policy of the Congregational churches did this in withholding a vote from women and minors . A more arbitrary and indefensible measure it would be hard to imagine . And a denomination which to this day has not shaken off the habit entirely , could certainly have nothing to say against committing its political rights to a restricted body with superior qualifications . We are not yet willing to undertake the advocacy of such a // measure . We only allude to it to show that should the churches throw themselves on the free charter which has been given them , they would still have it in their power to reserve in their own hands the administration of those ecelesiasticopolitical forms which it might be found unsafe to commit to believers in the first and simple stages of their Christian progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow the questions of local church government to overpower the liberty or the rights of the Church of the covenant and the sacraments as founded by Christ . Jt can never be safe to appeal to the political exigencies of a local organization in extenuation of a curtailment of those rights and of those privileges which all denominations exist only to foster and to cherish .
