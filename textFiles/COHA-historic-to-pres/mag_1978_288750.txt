Auto sales are thawing out <P> When auto executives made their annual sales forecasts last year , they reached a consensus that more than 11 million cars would be sold during the 1978 model-year . Then they spent the winter chewing their nails ; as snowstorms ravaged the Midwest and Northeast , sales fell to an annual rate of around 10 million . Now the prognosticators of Detroit think they are being vindicated . Though a downturn in the last ten days kept March sales from catching up to those in the same month a year earlier , they came within 1.4% . Even better , sales of 883,000 U.S.-made cars and 192,000 imports during the month work out to an annual rate of 11.5 million cars . Says Lee lacocca , the peppery president of Ford Motor Co. , " We have recovered from the frostbite of January and February . March was n't a turnaround . It was a resumption of sales . The market was there ; it was buried in the snow . " <P> Sales figures suggest that buyers are becoming more discriminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special sales contests , during which dealers pare prices , sales increased dramatically . While total new-car sales were down for the first six months of the 1978 model-year , sales of compact and subcompact cars increased by 13% . The star performer at General Motors last month was the boxy Chevette ; its sales were up 84% , compared with a year ago . At Ford , Mustang sales rose 14% , while the new Fairmont is a stellar seller . Ford 's lacocca puts himself in the position of a price-conscious buyer who has been out of the market for a few years and then visits a showroom to do some tire kicking . Says he sympathetically , " It 's a jolt to see what you pay . " <P> The major sour note in the industry is Chrysler 's deteriorating financial position . Sales of the compact Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon , the first small front-wheel-drive cars to be made in the U.S. , are up to expectations . But these cars appear to be snatching some customers from Chrysler 's own Volare and Aspen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operating loss of $49.7 million , compared with an operating profit of $119.2 million in the 1976 period . This year 's first quarter probably wound up in the red too because the company 's share of the total U.S. market has slipped ( to 11.3% in March ) and foreign operations are producing mounting losses . Standard &; Poors has downgraded the company 's bond rating , and a group of antimanagement stockholders anticipates that the 900-per-share dividend will be eliminated . Besides conserving cash and issuing 20 million shares of a new preferred stock this year , Chrysler may sell off some of its money-losing operations . Reason : it must spend $7.5 billion over the next five years to modernize North American plants and develop new models .
