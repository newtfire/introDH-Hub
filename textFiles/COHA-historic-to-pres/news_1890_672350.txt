There is not much to recommend the Liquor Tax bill introduced in the Assembly yesterday by Mr. Kira of this city . It proposes a State commission of three members , with salaries of $8,000 a year each , and deputies , clerks , experts , &c.,; to collect a tax on the sale and manufacture of liquors and prevent adulterations . It is proposed virtually to delegate the selection of the Commissioners to the State committees of the two political parties and the Prohibition Party . Nothing could be worse in principle than that public officers should be either elected or appointed , not by the people or by public authorities regularly vested with that power , but by political committees . A tax on the gross amount of sales by retail and wholesale and on the output of distilleries and breweries would tend to an immense amount of fraud and perjury . Moreover , the liquor business ought to be dealt with by a regular excise system and controlled through local authorities . Regulation rather than taxation should be the object of the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well be obtained through license fees as by a double system of imposing a tax on the top of the excise fees . Adulteration can be better reached through local authorities than by a cumbrous State system . Efforts ought to be concentrated upon improvement of the excise laws , and there is a bill now pending for that purpose upon which a hearing was given at Albany yesterday . Liquor-tax bills only complicate the question and hinder its settlement .
