Back in his early , funny days , Bill Cosby used to do a pretty good routine about Noah 's ark . " You 're supposed to see all and know all , " Noah tells God . " Well , have you seen the bottom of that ark ? Who 's going to clean up that mess ? " <P> Cosby was ahead of his time . There 's a bit of a boom in biblical fiction these days : Jacob 's four wives got the novelistic treatment in Anita Diamant 's The Red Tent , and this spring brought us Rebecca Kohn 's The Gilded Chamber , starring Esther , and Marek Halter 's Sarah , which gamely fills in that figure 's early life and makes a passionate love story of her marriage to Abraham . Like Cosby 's routine , these books all come with a pleasantly blasphemous tingle . Do they dare improve on the Bible ? What do they give us that the Good Book does n't ? <P> Short answer : the good stuff . In The Preservationist ( St. Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks on Noah again , and with good reason . The story of Noah , crowded with incident though it is , gets just four brief chapters in Genesis , and Maine has a terrific time romping around in the gaps between the verses , mouthing off in the somber silences between those Old Testament phrases . How does it feel to be 600 years old , as Noe ( Maine uses archaic spellings for biblical names ) was at the time of the flood ? The Bible offhandedly mentions giants  --  what were those dudes like ? Noe 's three sons had wives , who presumably had names and personalities and feelings of their own . For Maine , the devilment is in those kinds of details . <P> As it turns out , much of the fun of The Preservationist lies with Noe 's daughters-in-law , who furnish him with a chatty , catty shipboard peanut gallery . His eldest son Sem ( usually spelled Shem ) is married to unflappable , pragmatic Bera , who gets stuck with a lot of the animal-gathering chores . " The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she remarks tartly , " is that they think God will provide . " Cham ( Ham )  --  the most skeptical of the sons and the most sympathetic  --  is paired with mysterious , icy Ilya , a refugee from a northern land who subjects Noe 's religious zeal to intellectual scrutiny . " Only a man 's god , " she snaps , " would show love for his creation by destroying it . " <P> Of course , Noe has the toughest job , as both servant of an enigmatic , irascible deity and sitcom father to that feuding brood . Maine treats him irreverently , but if he knocks the patriarch down a peg , it 's only so that we can re-encounter the hoary Old Testament icon afresh as a sensual , fallible human being and really appreciate his greatness and his sacrifice . The Preservationist reminds us that being God 's servant 24/7 is both the ultimate privilege and a hell of a lot of hard work , and Noe is the hardest-working man in the Bible . <P> There is far more to Noe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell in a dozen novels , though here 's hoping he tries . As we learn in Genesis 9 : 28 , " And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years . " Three hundred and fifty years ? Do I smell a sequel ? As Noe 's wife wearily , wisely puts it , " The test does n't end when the flood does . It 's only the start . "  --  By Lev Grossman
