Catch us , Auntie Sara ! " <p> Giggles overrode romantic flute music flowing from overhead speakers as Sara Woodward reached for , and missed , her two squirming nephews . Brett and Brady slipped past her and through a narrow door that led into the display windows of Weddings by Woodwards bridal shop . <p> A door Sara had left ajar . <p> " You 're not allowed in here , guys , " she whispered . She followed only after she 'd checked to be sure none of the family was nearby . " Come out of there right now . " <p> But the mischievous pair would not emerge , and their impromptu game of tag was wreaking havoc with her grandmother 's bridal displays . Italian silk was n't meant for three-year-old boys with dirty sneakers . <p> Sara tried negotiation , to no avail . <p> Now what ? <p> " If those two are someone 's ring bearers , you 'll have your hands full getting them down the aisle . " <p> Startled by the masculine voice behind her , Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumped the arm of a groom mannequin , dislodging its top hat and cane . The brass-tipped ebony stick pinged against the display window with a clatter . <p> It seemed the entire building fell silent , including the two causes of this mayhem . Brady 's face wrinkled . He was going to start crying . Judging by the droop of his twin 's bottom lip , Brett would n't be far behind . <p> Sara knew exactly how they felt . Nothing about today was going right . <p> " Sorry I scared you . " Amusement laced the man 's voice the way a drop of rich cream mellows coffee . " Maybe I can help . Grab the one in blue and pass him to me , then you can haul out the red-shirted one . Okay ? " <p> " I 'll try . Thanks . " Sara did n't dare take her eyes off the twins . " Come on , Brett . Out you go . " <p> " No . " It was his favorite word . <p> Sara desperately wished she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's kids while he took an important call . Coming home to help out the family was one thing , but babysitting in a bridal store was asking for trouble . <p> A wicker basket hit the floor , scattering rose petals everywhere . <p> " Come on , Brett . We 'll play with your toys , " she wheedled . <p> " No . " <p> " No , " Brady copied . <p> " Auntie will get you a new toy . " Sara clung to her smile , feeling a fool in front of the stranger . Ordinarily she deplored bribery , but this situation called for desperate measures . " Do n't you want a new toy ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Yes ! " Exasperated , Sara extended her fingertips to snag a belt loop on Brett 's tiny blue jeans just as the voice behind her inquired : <p> " I do n't suppose either of them likes candy ? " <p> " Candy ? " Brett surged up so fast his head hit Sara 's chin , knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled down , almost forcing her off balance as he launched himself through the narrow passage . " I like candy . Candy 's good . " <p> " Sometimes it 's very good . " The voice behind Sara sounded amused by the bundle of nonstop energy . " Gotcha . But we ca n't have candy without your brother . Can you sit very still and wait for him ? " <p> " Brett 's a good boy . " <p> " You sure are , " the visitor agreed . " I wonder how good your brother is . " <p> The man knew kids . Brady 's frown deepened . He glared at Sara as if she 'd maligned his character . Or tried to steal his treat . <p> " Brady 's good , too ! " He dropped to all fours , crawled between Sara 's feet and out the door . <p> " Got him , too , " the masculine voice triumphed . " You can come out now . " <p> Sara was n't sure she wanted to . Not if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the pristine bridal dresses displayed all over the foyer . <p> " I assure you , it 's safe . " Laughter colored the edge of their visitor 's low-throated rumble . " For now , anyway . " <p> " I 'm coming . " She rubbed one finger against her throbbing skull and found her way blocked . " Would you step back ? It 's very narrow here . " <p> " Sure is . " He jostled the door against a tulle-covered arch laced with nodding sunflowers . The arch jiggled , then shifted . That knocked off the bride 's arm . It clattered to the floor along with her bouquet of dried autumn wildflowers . <p> The resulting mess was a far cry from Woodward 's usually chichi displays , but fixing it now was out of the question . Sara <p> could only hope she 'd get time to rectify matters before the family noticed . <p> Dream on . When had the family not noticed anything that affected Weddings by Woodwards ? <p> " Something wrong ? Need help ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point wishing their visitor would n't witness her backward , very uncool duckwalk out of the passage . Free at last , Sara clicked the lock closed , frustrated and fed up with the way her life was n't going . <p> " Winifred Woodward ? " <p> Did she look almost eighty ? <p> " No . " Sara bent to straighten her black skirt , buying time to regain the composure Denver 's hottest wedding store and its employees were known for . " But if you need help with a wedding , you 're in the right place . Weddings by Woodwards takes pride in planning weddings that are unique to every bride and groom we serve . " <p> The stock phrase slipped easily to her lips . Good thing , because when Sara glanced up at the owner of that coffee-and-cream voice , her throat jammed closed . <p> " Kidding . " He winked at her . " I was kidding . I could tell when I walked past the windows that you are n't Mrs. Woodward . " <p> Meaning he knew her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than the usual Woodwards ' groom , he stood nearly six feet tall . The mass of unruly mahogany curls cut close against his scalp could have given him a rakish look  --  except for the plump baby fingers threading through them . <p> " I 'll take him . " She reached out for Brady who glared at her and clutched his rescuer all the tighter . " Or not . " <p> " He 's fine . " The visitor wore black tooled-leather boots , fitted jeans and a battered leather jacket that almost screamed " wild west . " Evidently her nephew thought the same . <p> " Cowboy , " Brady said , trailing his grubby paws against the leather . " Horsie ? " <p> " Not here , pal . " The man chuckled as he tousled Brady 's hair . " But I have some at home on my ranch . " <p> " Horsies are good . Candy 's good . " <p> Sara 's rescuer burst into deep-throated laughter that filled the two-story foyer . <p> " Not very subtle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie-star material . Substitute his leather and jeans for a wedding tux , and any bride would race down the aisle . On closer scrutiny , Sara glimpsed an indefinable quality to those blue eyes that branded this man as more substantial than a mere movie star . The twins recognized it , too , because they remained perfectly still , staring at him . <p> " Thank you for helping . They 're a bit of a handful . " <p> " I can imagine . " His face was all sharp angles . Etched lines carved out the corners of his eyes , as if he 'd known sadness and grief too often . His sapphire stare captivated Sara , pushed past her barriers and peered inside , as if to expose the secrets she kept hidden from the world . <p> Or maybe it was all in her mind . <p> " I have an appointment to speak with Winifred Woodward . " He eased Brady 's grip from his hair and lowered the boy so his feet rested on the floor . " There you go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grandma Winnie was always fielding so-called appointments of people who simply wanted to meet the matriarch of Weddings by Woodwards . Winnie , sweet woman that she was , would never refuse them . That 's why Sara had come home . <p> Recent exhaustion had lowered Winnie 's ability to fight a cold and , according to the family , her grandmother needed complete rest to recover . Sara 's job was to fill in wherever she was needed at Woodwards . <p> Today that meant manning the reception desk . <p> And babysitting . <p> " Your name ? " <p> " Cade Porter . " <p> " You were n't in her appointment book , Mr. Porter . " Sara knew because she 'd canceled or rebooked all Winnie 's appointments last week , the day after she 'd returned to Denver . <p> " Nevertheless , I do have an appointment . " Dark brows climbed , daring her to dispute it . " Would you direct me to her office please ? " <p> " I 'm afraid that is n't going to be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jutting cheekbones and a forceful chin told Sara that Cade Porter would n't give up easily . <p> " Candy ? " Brady reminded . <p> " You have to wait a moment , sweetie . " <p> " ' Kay . " <p> " Good boy . " Sara savored his winsome smile before returning to her customer . " I 'm assuming you 're here to talk about planning a wedding , Mr. Porter . If you can wait , I 'll find you a planner as soon as I get these two settled . I have to watch them until my brother returns . As you 've noticed , they take a lot of watching . " <p> " I did notice . " Cade Porter 's lips lifted in a grin . He squatted down and spoke quietly to the twins , showing them two wrapped peppermints , identical to the ones filling a crystal bowl on the counter . He glanced at her belatedly . " Okay with you ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " Anything to keep them busy . " She ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . One candy could n't hurt . <p> " Here are the rules , guys . " Mr. Porter waited until their attention was focused on him . " You have to sit here until you 're finished . Then we 'll wash your hands . After that , maybe I 'll tell you about my horses . Is it a deal ? " <p> Enthralled , the twins nodded , received their candy and began unwrapping . Mr. Porter rose . His face lost the soft amusement as he studied Sara . <p> " Look , I 'm sure you employ good people here , but I want Mrs. Woodward . I confirmed with her eight days ago . Surely Weddings by Woodwards does n't promise their clients one thing and then " <p> Sara might not want to be part of the family business , but nobody disparaged it and got away unchallenged . <p> " My grandmother was taken ill a week ago . I regret that you were n't informed . " She bent to pick up the wrappers the boys had tossed on the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been inconvenienced . But because Winnie wo n't be back at work for at least a month , I 'm afraid you 'll have to make a new appointment . Or accept help from someone else . " <p> His heavily lashed eyes darkened . <p> " I 'm sorry she 's ill . Maybe  --  " He stopped , frowned as if reconsidering . <p> Red flags soared in Sara 's brain . If she lost a potential client , her sister Katie would be on her case all afternoon . <p> " If you 'll  --  " Sara almost choked when Brett 's sticky fingers grabbed Mr. Porter at the knee . She eased Brady 's hand away . What was taking Reese so long ? " I 'm sorry about that , " she apologized , trying to recall who might be free to deal with Mr. Porter . <p> " They 're just jeans . They wo n't melt . Can you get a wet cloth ? " <p> " A cloth ? " His generous smile confused her usually functioning brain . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those pretty dresses on <p> display will look quite as nice with peppermint smeared all over them . " He brushed Brady 's hair with a big capable hand . " We 'll get this pair busy drawing a horse . Then maybe you and I can get started . " <p> Sara frowned . Started  --  doing what ? <p> " Cloth ? " he reminded her as he kept Brett 's hand from touching a length of veiling . <p> " Right . " She fetched a damp washcloth and tried to wipe Brett 's fingers , but her nephew veered away , clinging to Mr. Porter . <p> " Let me . " He took the cloth and with gentle thoroughness wiped down two faces and four hands , teasing the boys as he did . Her nephews had never behaved so well . <p> " Do n't look so surprised . Kids usually like me . " Mr. Porter grinned as he handed back the cloth . <p> " I 'm sure they do . I 've just never seen these two so quiet . " Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're asleep . " <p> Mr. Porter 's lips twitched . He hunkered down next to the boys who were arguing over the crayons and paper pads scattered across the coffee table . He told them a little about his ranch , then promised a special treat for whoever could draw the best horse . <p> How did he know competition was the best way to get them focused ? <p> " Okay , now can we talk about my wedding ? " Cade Porter rose , folded his arms across his wide chest , charm oozing from the lopsided smile he flashed at her . " Unless Woodward Weddings ca n't handle it . " <p> " Weddings by Woodwards , " she corrected . <p> " Yeah , that . " His gaze slid to the wall above the counter . " I assume that array of diplomas includes you as one of the wedding planners ? " <p> Sara followed his gaze , noticed a silver framed certificate she 'd earned four years ago hanging among the rest of the family 's . Trust her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara was permanently back on staff . <p> " I  --  um  --  " <p> " My mistake . " His mouth tightened . " I 'd prefer Mrs. Woodward to handle things , but because that 's out , perhaps you 'll summon whoever 's handling her cases . " <p> Offended , Sara bristled to her own defense . <p> " I am a certified wedding planner , Mr. Porter . I 've planned about forty weddings and I am quite capable of handling your needs . " Even if her family always interfered . <p> " I need someone who can deal with the unusual . " He studied her for several moments , his gaze dark and inscrutable . <p> " Then you need me . " The words slipped out without a second thought . Sara almost groaned . She was as bad as the twins , taking the bait faster than they 'd latched on to his promise of candy . <p> " Do I ? " Cade Porter blinked . <p> His dubious demeanor underscored her own growing doubts . Like her siblings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learned to walk . But she had n't planned a wedding since she 'd walked out of Weddings by Woodwards two years ago to escape her loving , but constantly meddling family . <p> Which did not mean she 'd forgotten everything she 'd learned here . <p> " What kind of a wedding do you want , Mr. Porter ? " <p> " That 's an odd question . " He scratched his shaven chin , seemingly stymied . " How many kinds are there ? " <p> " Many . " Obviously Cade Porter was a complete innocent . <p> " Horsie . " Brett held up his scribble . <p> " Hmm . Not bad . But he needs legs . " <p> While Cade and the boys discussed horse anatomy , Sara found a notepad and pen . She 'd come home to help . Might as well do her best . <p> " What are my choices ? " he asked , twisting his head to study her . <p> " When are you to be married ? " <p> " I 'm not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wedding . " <p> " So you 're not getting married  --  but you want to plan a wedding ? " Sara 's headache amplified . <p> " Exactly . " Humor twinkled in the depths of his blue eyes . " I want to plan a wedding for my sister . " <p> " Ah . " While her brother Reese probably would n't plan a wedding for her , Sara was pretty sure the rest of the family certainly would . They 'd find her a groom , arrange the ceremony and take over every detail without asking for her input  --  if she let them . <p> Sara loved her family dearly , but they refused to acknowledge that she was an adult who could think and choose her own course in life . <p> " Those two tornadoes are n't going to color for long , " Cade reminded . <p> " Sorry . I was thinking . " She had to find out about Mr. Porter 's sister . Having experienced prying too often herself , Sara decided on tact . " Weddings should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring or summer events work best . Is she thinking of a large event ? Sit-down reception ? Church wedding or  --  " <p> " Yes ! " <p> " Yes ? " Pulling teeth would be easier . " Yes  --  what , exactly ? " <p> " Church wedding . I think . " He glanced around the reception area . His nose wrinkled when his glance landed on delicate white wrought iron chairs with their tufted white silk cushions . " The reception ca n't be stuffy . Not like  --  <br> Continues ...
