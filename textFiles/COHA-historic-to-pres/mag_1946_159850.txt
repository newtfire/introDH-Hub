Some 3,000 well-wishers , among them the President , gathered at Washington National Airport to see Secretary of State Byrnes off to the Paris Peace Conference . Said Mr. Truman : " The country is behind Mr. Byrnes in his efforts to get a just peace for the world . . . . Good luck , Mr. Byrnes . " <P> Mr. Byrnes climbed into the President 's plane , the Sacred Cow , and soared off . He would need luck . Once more the U.S. and Russia were meeting at the council table , and once again it would be a meeting between political enemies , not friends . U.S. weapons : its military potential , the atomic bomb , the moral force of its people . <P> Awful Responsibility . What was the moral force behind Jimmy Byrnes ? How deeply had it impressed Russia and the world ? One answer was contained in the record of U.S. behavior at the end of the first year of the Atomic Age , which Harry Truman had ushered in with the words : " It is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The U.S. earnestly wanted peace . It had gone hell-bent into peacetime . It had dissipated its military power , despite its Chief of Staff 's warning : " We have tried since the birth of our nation to promote our love of peace by a display of weakness . This course has failed us utterly , cost us millions of lives and billions of treasure . " <P> Strikes had swept the country . The President 's attempt to bring management and labor together in conference ended in fiasco . Walter Reuther shut down General Motors , Phil Murray shut down steel , and by January there were more people on strike than ever before in U.S. history . On April Fool 's Day John Lewis shut the soft coal mines and the next month Messrs . Whitney &; Johnston stopped the railroads . <P> Always a Crisis . Congress had shown indecision and small courage , ducked unpleasant decisions ( e.g. , the draft law extension , fair employment practices , a minimum wage , OPA ) when it could . The people of Mississippi were glad to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six more years . Congressman Andrew Jackson May , chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee and loudest voice in military matters , was accused of having aided wartime profiteers and chiselers . <P> The prestige of the President , on the crest at the beginning of the Atomic Year , fell like a spent rocket . His appointments were widely criticized . He plaintively observed : " There is always a crisis . " Labor , which had helped put him , in office , shouted : " Down with Truman . " <P> August justices of the Supreme ' Court , split with feuds , shrilled at one another like fishwives . Said Justice Jackson : " I told Justice Black . . . that I would not stand for any more of his bullying . " <P> Bricks &; Stripes . In Markowitz ' saloon in Kansas City a laundry-truck driver sipped a beer . What did he think about the world ? " You can have it , " he said . " It 's all hurrah for me and the hell with you .
