He has a rugged build , but there is an innate sensitivity about him . He seems above all , out of place , but he seems out of place nearly anywhere . He has a dueling scar on his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor too low . And it must have once laid the side teeth bare . At first  --  4  --  glance he seems to be everything that a German man of good breeding and intellect should look like . But there is another dimension about him . A man caught between periods . A man who has not yet found his clear identity . A man with whom something is irretrievably lost . 6 EXT . DECK - DAY - DR SCHUMANN turns into one of the passageways . 7 INT . CABIN - DAY - CAPTAIN 'S CABIN It is a tastefully furnished cabin that looks out of place on the Vera . It has been fixed up with mementos that CAPT . THIELE has picked up all over the world . Prominent is a Japanese print or two and some other objects of art , tasteful and inconspicuous . Capt .

Anything interesting at all ? &nbsp; DR . WILLIE SCHUMANN ( the passengers pass through his clinical inner eye ) There 's a dwarf with the brightest tie you ever saw in your life .

DINING ROOM - DAY - ANGLE It has the grubby , homely characteristics of the Vera . However , it is clean and well-polished . There are flowers on the table and an adequate display of fairly white napery and tableware . Waiters , alert with the nationally characteristic sense of duty , move with a mollified , expectant air . CAMERA MOVES to Captain 's table in the center of the room . The diners are , as the CAMERA discovers them : Siegfried Rieber , a small man of enormous vitality , wearing a pincenez . He bounces up and down like a rubber ball at the table . He has a zest for life . The kind of life he was taught as a boy  --  beer , girls with long legs , hot arguments . In short , the good , bourgeois life . He immediately inspires a feeling of trust . He is a Rotarian of all countries with one difference . He has the courage of his prejudices . Sitting next to him is Lizzi Spockenkieker , a saleswoman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . She is in her late  --  8  --  thirties . She is angular with long legs and a definite hat . Animal lust seems to reek from her . She considers herself very attractive . But it is men like Siegfried Rieber who principally think so . Professor Hutten and Frau Professor Hutten , two substantial-looking people in their fifties . Frau Professor Hutten almost always follows a few paces behind Professor Hutten , such is her subservience and adoration of him . Sitting in a chair next to Frau Hutten is their dog , Bebe , who bears an uncanny resemblance to his masters . Next to them is GUSTAV FREYTAG , a handsome German man in his late twenties . There is something immediately sympathetic and appealing about him . He looks a little bewildered , as though he were trying to find a meaning for some-thing in the events around him and in the faces of the other guests at the table . WILIBALD GRAF , sitting in a wheelchair , is a small , weary , dying man with hair that is sparse and dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything going on around him at the table . His nephew , JOHANN , nineteen , a tall boy with glittering gold hair and a sulking mouth . FRAU OTTO SCHMITT , a dumpy-looking sympathetic woman . &nbsp; RIEBERThe best place is home . It is good to be on a German boat with German people going home . Say what you will , there is a feeling when German people get together , I do n't know how to explain it , gemutliche , camaraderie , that exists among no other people - at least I have found it nowhere else . &nbsp; LIZZIYou know what they say in Mexico ? Mexicans loathe the Americans , despise the Jews , hate the Spaniards , distrust the English , admire the French , and love the Germans . &nbsp; RIEBERThat is all very nice . I am glad they say that about us . But as far as I am concerned , after spending a few weeks in Mexico you can keep the Mexicans , too . There is laughter around the table .  --  9  --  &nbsp; LIZZI ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been home , Herr Freytag ? &nbsp; FREYTAGFour months . &nbsp; LIZZIEYou must be glad to be going home , too . &nbsp; FREYTAGI am . My wife is there . We 've been separated since I came here . &nbsp; LIZZIWhy is it that every charming man I meet is married ? &nbsp; RIEBERMy dear Miss Spockenkieker , you have wounded me to the quick . &nbsp; LIZZIExcepting you , Herr Rieber . I am sorry . Rieber nods , bursts into good-natured laughter . Takes Lizzie 's hand , kisses it for a long moment . &nbsp; FRAU SCHMITT ( looking at Bebe , a fat , white bulldog , who sits beside her in an empty chair ) That little dog is so sweet . &nbsp; FRAU HUTTENHe has shared so much of the Professor 's life and mine , I feel sometimes he is like our son . &nbsp; LIZZIDo you think it is correct to bring a dog to the table ?  --  10  --  &nbsp; FRAU HUTTEN ( her feelings hurt ) Babe goes with us everywhere . We have taken him to some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR SCHUMANN ENTERS &nbsp; DR . WILLIE SCHUMANNGood afternoon . I 'm Wilhelm Schumann , the ship 's doctor . The Captain sends his regrets . He is unable to come to lunch because of . . . ship 's business . There are murmurs around the table of polite expressions of understanding . It is obvious that the presence and manner of Dr. Schumann impresses them , particularly his well-placed scar . &nbsp; RIEBERDoctor . Allow me . I am Siegfried Rieber . This is Professor Hutten , Frau Hutten , their dog , Bebe . This lovely lady is Fraulein Spockenkieker . Frau Schmitt , Herr Graf , his nephew Johann . &nbsp; LIZZI ( purring admiringly ) Have you been with the boat long , Doctor ? &nbsp; DR . WILLIE SCHUMANNJust three voyages . Dr. Schumann looks over at Graf , evaluating him clinically . &nbsp; PROFESSOR HUTTEN ( to Rieber ) Did I hear them say you publish a magazine with intellectual features , Herr Rieber ? &nbsp; RIEBERWe have asked talented writers from all over the country to contribute to one topic : How we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national greatness .  --  11  --  &nbsp; PROFESSOR HUTTENWhat foreign influences ? Rieber indicates a table where a man sits all alone . CAMERA goes to the man . It is Lowenthal . 10 CLOSEUP - FREYTAG in reaction . 11 MED . SHOT - DR SCHUMANN He speaks quietly to Johann while the other conversation goes on . &nbsp; DR . WILLIE SCHUMANN ( quietly ) Does your uncle need attendance ? &nbsp; JOHANN ( gruffly ) He 'll be all right . &nbsp; DR . WILLIE SCHUMANNI 'll be at your disposal if you need me . &nbsp; GRAF ( speaking for the first time ) You need have no concern for me . I do not believe in materia medica . Pause . &nbsp; DR . WILLIE SCHUMANN ( with amusement ) Really . Have you found something better to replace it ? &nbsp; GRAFFaith . &nbsp; DR . WILLIE SCHUMANNFaith . I see . Very well . Waiter brings wine . Goes around the table pouring . &nbsp; LIZZIE ( to Rieber ) I saw you exchange the cards on the table . That is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIEBER ( with relish ) Since it is next to yours , I want it always to be free for me ! ( rises ) A toast . A toast to the ship . A toast to the Captain . A toast to the Doctor , and also that we will not be needing the services of the Doctor . Laughter and applause . The guests clink glasses . Rieber sits down . Takes a sip of his wine . &nbsp; RIEBERDelicious . He squeezes Lizzi 's leg under the table . &nbsp; LIZZIHerr Rieber ! CAMERA MOVES to Julius Lowenthal , a large , vital man , quick-witted , optimistic , determined to deal with the world on its own terms ; an incurable optimist . He dresses in a very Germanic fashion , more Germanic than anyone on board . There is a humor about him . The humor he feels about his own predicament and incidentally a wealth of compassion for others which he tries his best to hide . He watches the waiters with some amusement as they hurry by , ignoring him . He puts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes him . &nbsp; LOWENTHALCome here . Young waiter looks at him dubiously . Lowenthal smiles . &nbsp; LOWENTHALYes . You ! ( wags his finger again ) Come here . Young waiter comes over slowly . 12 CLOSEUP - WAITER There is a secretive , contemptuous , amused expression on his face .  --  13  --  13 CLOSEUP - LOWENTHAL He recognizes the young waiter 's expression . He is used to it . 14 ANGLE - LOWENTHAL - WAITER Young waiter nods , giving Lowenthal only the barest courtesy . Lowenthal understanding every slight in the waiter 's attitude and determined to ignore it , deal with it , and be as pleasant as possible  --  &nbsp; LOWENTHALI 've been sitting here twenty minutes . I think you and I better have an understanding from the beginning . I take it you expect some kind of remuneration for your services ? I mean some kind of tip ? Pause . 15 CLOSEUP - WAITER &nbsp; WAITERI would presume so , mein Herr . 16 CLOSE SHOT - LOWENTHAL - WAITER &nbsp; LOWENTHALWell , if you expect gratuities , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be prompt . No more prompt to me than anyone else . But just as prompt . Do I make myself clear ? Now . Is the blue trout fresh ? &nbsp; WAITER ( the slight edge of contempt still in his voice ) Yes , mein Herr . &nbsp; LOWENTHALI 'll have some blue trout and some Kassler Rippenspeer . &nbsp; YOUNG WAITERYes , mein Herr . ( starts to go )  --  14  --  &nbsp; LOWENTHALJust a minute . And I 'll have a half bottle white wine . &nbsp; YOUNG WAITERYes , mein Herr ! &nbsp; LOWENTHAL ( dismissing him grandly but formally ) Thank you . Lowenthal looks about , somewhat more at ease and enjoying himself more since he has stated his position . CAMERA MOVES to entrance . Mary Treadwell enters . She is an attractive woman of about forty-six . She is an American and dressed well . Headwaiter goes over to her . &nbsp; MARYI 'd like to have a table alone , please . &nbsp; HEADWAITERI 'm sorry , Madame . There is not a table available . &nbsp; MARY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEADWAITERThat is a different matter , Madame . Headwaiter leads Mary to table with William Denny . WILLIAM DENNY is a baseball player who has seen better days . His physique is still good but just the suggestion of running-to-fat is present and the somewhat soiled impression that one gets of athletes who drop even in the slightest the rigorous program they have imposed upon themselves . He is above all , bewildered by his present surroundings . Mary stands before table expecting Denny to rise . Denny does not . &nbsp; MARYDo n't bother getting up . Denny makes a motion as though to rise . Mary sits down .  --  15  --  &nbsp; DENNY ( delighted ) You 're American . My name is Bill Denny . &nbsp; MARYMary Treadwell . &nbsp; DENNYMaybe you can help me . What is . . . Rhinishe . . .

Pause .  --  16  --  &nbsp; DENNY ( apologetically ) I 'm not one for those fancy sauces , I go for the simple stuff . My system works better that way . 17 CLOSEUP - MARY winces a little at the grossness of his expression . 18 TWO SHOT Denny nods . Her reaction escaping him . &nbsp; DENNYI worked out a couple hours this morning . I feel great ! Flexes his muscles unconsciously . 19 CLOSEUP - MARY Her reaction to him is one of sexual provocation and revulsion . 20 CLOSEUP - DENNY Her reaction escaping him . He continues . &nbsp; DENNY ( unable to resist ) Ever hear of the Dallas Steers ? &nbsp; MARYNo . What are they ? Denny swallows hard . &nbsp; DENNYIt 's a baseball team . I was with them for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARYThat 's too bad . &nbsp; DENNYI ended up in Vera Cruz trying to teach these greasers how to play ball . Saved up a little dough .

Where are you going ?  --  17  --  &nbsp; MARYParis . &nbsp; DENNYParis. ( with an open leer ) Hey , that 's the place , is n't it ? Mary reacts to his gaucherie with a wince . &nbsp; DENNYI 'd like to see Paris . London , too . I guess I 'll just look around and play it by ear . 21 ANGLE - PEPE AND AMPARO Amparo is about 18 . Dark and very beautiful and at first flush seemingly innocent . Pepe is almost handsome in a wizened way . The fact that he is not as handsome as he might have been arouses pity in one . He feels this instinctively and plays upon it on other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pepe . &nbsp; PEPEI 'll give you one more time to hang yourself . I know you got more money from the Swede . &nbsp; AMPAROI gave you what I got . &nbsp; PEPEI asked the barman . &nbsp; AMPAROHe 's lying . &nbsp; PEPEIf you 're holding out on me , I 'll rip your lying tongue out . &nbsp; AMPARORip my guts out ! I do n't have it ! 22 ANGLE second Spanish table with Pastora , Manolo , Ric and Rac and several other of what consists of the Zarzuela Troupe . Ric and Rac , identical twins , a boy and girl , aged six , whose real names are Armando and Dolores and who have renamed themselves after  --  18  --  their favorite cartoon characters , seem to be the picture of innocence , but they are far from that . They know only one code of loyalty and it is to each other . PASTORA is a dark , beautiful woman , who is just now in her middle twenties , but for a Spanish woman who has been a dancer-prostitute for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old in anyone else . Manolo is a slow-witted , irresponsible Spanish pimp about thirty . There is a buzz of noise at the table . Ric reaches for the celery in the middle of the table . Manolo takes the back of his knife and brings it down viciously on Ric 's hand . Ric cries out in pain . Manolo continues talking as though nothing had happened . 23 ANGLE Lutzes ' table , with Lutz , Frau Lutz and Elsa . Lutz is middle-aged , rotund , Swiss hotel keeper . Frau Lutz is a sharp , Swiss , canny woman , whose eyes dart sharply in her head . Their daughter , Elsa , is seventeen , too tall , awkward , and very sensitive about her seemingly lumpish appearance . &nbsp; ELSAMama , my cabin mate is that American girl over there . Frau Lutz looks over at Jenny . &nbsp; FRAU LUTZI am sorry to hear that . &nbsp; ELSAShe 's over there with that lighthaired man . I thought they were married , did n't you ? &nbsp; FRAU LUTZI 'm sorry to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her at all . &nbsp; ELSAShe 's so gay and pretty . &nbsp; FRAU LUTZLet her alone , just the same . &nbsp; ELSAYou always forbid me to see anyone I like .  --  19  --  &nbsp; LUTZElsa , you must be a good girl . You always must do as your mama says . &nbsp; FRAU LUTZElsa , sit up straight . I do not know what is the matter with the girl these days . I think what she may need is a good purge . Yes , I think that may be just the thing she needs . 24 TABLE - DAVID AND JENNY Jenny Brown is an extraordinarily attractive girl of twenty-four . Her vitality and charm are enormous . She wears a bright-colored blouse and slacks  --  the slacks are a kind of badge of defiance . Turned-up nose , twinkling eyes , she is the European 's idea of the bright , young American girl . David Scott is a solid-looking man of twenty-eight . While not handsome , there is an animal vitality about him . His eyes seem to encompass everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his art . &nbsp; JENNYIs n't it ridiculous to have separate cabins ? &nbsp; DAVIDIt saves a lot of explanations . &nbsp; JENNYI would have said to hell with it if you had . &nbsp; DAVID ( with some surprise ) I did it on account of you . Jenny laughs . &nbsp; JENNY ( mimicking him ) You did n't have to do it on account of me . &nbsp; DAVIDWe should have compared notes .

She 's shocked out of her skin that we are n't married . David laughs .

Do you realize that we never talk about anything basic and important to us ? There is a moment . &nbsp; JENNYTwenty-six days in separate beds . It 's probably a very good thing . &nbsp; DAVID ( dryly ) How 's that again ? &nbsp; JENNYWe 'll get to know each other . We 'll get to know whether we have anything going for us except sex . They laugh , but there is an undercurrent of gravity about it . DISSOLVE TO : &nbsp; pp. 22-46 28 EXT .

Romance of a sort seems to be simmering around them , their skins breathing forth musk and amber . They are inordinately dressed up . Red-stemmed cigarettes sag from their scarlet full mouths . Smoke curls toward their narrowed eyes and heavily beaded lashes . Lola is a commanding beauty ; dark and healthy . Amparo is smaller , thin , apparently in frail health , but indicating an animal ferocity underneath . Most of the men passing stop for an instant to drink them in : The officers , male passengers . Johann wheeling Graf nearly stops dead for a moment as he sees Amparo , then continues on .  --  22  --  30 LIZZI AND RIEBER WALK ALONG - RIEBER HOLDING LIZZIE 'S HAND They sing a German song together . The words are not quite audible but it is melancholy and melodic . 31 TWO IDENTICAL TWINS , RIC AND RAC race around the wheelchair , as though almost trying to upset it . Johann curses them under his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Amparo is Denny , who whistles nonchalantly , pretending to look at the ocean , in the bar , at anything but Lola and Amparo .

He is not sure what it is . He pauses . 36 DR SCHUMANN 'S POV Ric and Rac near the rail . They have something in their hands .

Dr. Schumann looks after them , scarcely believing what has almost happened . There is a moment . Dr. Schumann makes his way to the deck chair , sits down . He considers what has happened - puts two fingers to his pulse professionally . He reaches cautiously in his inside pocket and takes a small vial of crystal drops ; brings it to his lips , then sits a moment without moving . DISSOLVE TO : 45 EXT .

There is no reason to expect any radical change in his organic constitution now . He could not keep his bottle down as a puppy if he was in the least bit agitated . Frau Hutten looks at Bebe piteously . &nbsp; FRAU HUTTENPerhaps you should call the Doctor ? &nbsp; PROFESSOR HUTTENAttack , Bebe ! Attack !  --  24  --  The dog weakly struggles to his feet  --  ready . &nbsp; FRAU HUTTENWhat are you doing ? Leave him alone . &nbsp; PROFESSOR HUTTENLook at the good animal .

She is not encouraged . &nbsp; ELSA ( mournfully ) I think sometimes if I had different clothes or a permanent wave . Maybe if I had one of those . But my mother says young girls must be perfectly pure and natural in every way . No curls even . They must wait for everything until they get married , even to use perfume . But suppose I never get married ? &nbsp; JENNYWell , you have to fall in love first . ( pauses - smiles a little ) &nbsp; ELSANo . Never .

Underneath is an old-fashioned corselette with lace bows and tattering around the edges . They look at each other awkwardly . There is a moment . As they continue to undress they stand revealed in their different attitudes , different upbringing . They might have come from different worlds . &nbsp; ELSABut what happens if I never fall in love ? &nbsp; JENNYWell , then someone will fall in love with you . &nbsp; ELSABut suppose no one falls in love with me ?

It 's a strange neck of the woods . &nbsp; DAVIDWhat do you mean ? &nbsp; DENNYIt 's a strange neck of the woods ! Ever hear of the Dallas Steers ? &nbsp; DAVIDNo . &nbsp; GLOCKEN ( smiles warmly ) Is it some sort of cowboy outfit ? &nbsp; DENNY ( throws him a dark look ; continues on , undaunted ) I 'm used to all kinds of people , see ? But I 'll tell you something that happened to me in Vera Cruz . I was going through Immigration , see ? I 'm standing in line . I call the clerk " Pancho " just being friendly . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mac " or a railway porter " George . " Well , this little nigra  --   --  28  --  all these coast Mexicans have nigra blood they tell me  --  just stares back at me .

He looks at Glocken and David as though still amazed at the clerk 's attitude . &nbsp; DAVID ( dryly ) I think I 'll turn in . &nbsp; GLOCKENMe too . David starts undressing .

MARY 'S AND LIZZI 'S CABIN - NIGHT - CLOSEUP - MARY TREADWELL LYING IN HER BED She lies in the middle of her narrow bunk as though it were an island . She is unutterably bored listening to Lizzi 's conversation . She has a small glass of wine in her hand . She drinks it in slow occasional sips . She wears a nightgown of smooth white satin , with a buttoned-up collar and full bishop sleeves .

Herr Rieber is an intellectual . He is part of the movement to restore German publishing . The foreigners and the Jews have poisoned the intellectual thinking . He is a man of ideas , Herr Rieber , in spite of the fact that he is so playful at times . Of course , bachelors like Herr Rieber are spoiled . They think they can have their way with any woman they want . But in spite of the fact that we spend three days in each other 's company after we met in Vera Cruz , Herr Rieber has not spoken of marriage . With me , there must be talk of marriage . I might not say yes , but there must be talk of marriage . Lizzi looks at Mary lying there ; makes an attempt at being ingratiating and charming . &nbsp; LIZZIMrs .

I saw her from the moment she came in . And I watched her while she danced with  --  33  --  another man . While I was watching her , I had the feeling that she was looking at me , too . At first I thought I was crazy , but then I was sure of it . I went over to her table . I had to pretend that we had met before so as not to embarrass her by having a stranger ask her to dance . We danced . &nbsp; PEPEVery lovely . Very romantic . ( pours another cognac ) In Spain we are romantic also . I have a friend of mine who courted a girl seven years because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch her . &nbsp; FREYTAGSeven years ? It does n't seem possible . &nbsp; PEPE ( confirming it ) Seven years .

Freytag is surprised at this casual and matter-of-fact approach of Pepe 's in light of the previous conversation . &nbsp; FREYTAGVery attractive . &nbsp; PEPEThey are very lonely on the boat . We have our wives and we have our romantic attachments . But there are also other attachments . The girls asked about you . You seemed to have made an impression . It 's a long trip . Perhaps I can arrange an introduction . ( pause ) &nbsp; FREYTAG ( quietly ) No thanks . Pepe pours some more brandy for Freytag.  --  34  --  &nbsp; PEPEIf you change your mind , let me know .

LOWENTHAL - RIEBER CABIN - NIGHT - JULIUS LOWENTHAL is arranging his articles on the sink , very neatly . He is in his crisp , grey , clean pajamas , goes over to his valise , opens it , places an article in it . We see that the valise has been very neatly packed . He looks at the luggage of his cabin-mate who he has not yet met . Then begins to go over to the sink , singing a little song . Brushes his teeth . The door opens . Before Lowenthal can turn and find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( warmly ) Gruss Gott . Rieber stops short at the door , looks at Lowenthal , appalled , then goes to his luggage , examines it carefully . Underneath , his emotions are roaring : How dare they ? What do they mean by putting him in the same cabin with a Jew ? Is it some kind of trick they are pulling on him ? Or are they trying to embarrass him ? At the sink , Lowenthal is brushing his teeth more slowly . He is thinking : Of all the luck . He might have known that of all the passengers on the ship , they would put this pig in the same cabin with him . He finally finishes brushing his teeth , rinses toothbrush carefully , puts it away neatly so that it forms an even pattern with the rest of his cosmetics . Takes off his slippers carefully .  --  35  --  Rieber goes to sink . He takes his washing kit . Looks at Lowenthal 's cosmetics with distate . Puts down his own bag . Finally , in a gesture as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cosmetics to one side , some of them tipping over . Lowenthal watches Rieber for a moment . At first he can not really believe his eyes . He stares at Rieber as Rieber takes out some mouthwash to gargle . Rieber shoots him an abrupt look . Lowenthal goes over to the sink carefully and dispassionately and picks up his toilet articles , places them back on the sink . &nbsp; LOWENTHALMy name is Julius Lowenthal . Rieber stares at him as though he were insane . &nbsp; LOWENTHALI take it you are not exactly pleased that we are shipmates on this voyage . You may take it from me that I am not exactly overwhelmed with the prospect either . However , since we are , due to either someone 's sense of humor , or a caprice of fate , the captives of each other 's company for twenty-six days , I think it is best if we reach a kind of understanding . Our cosmetics , for instance . I will keep , if it meets with your approval , on this side of the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink . Otherwise , we may wind up throwing shaving cream at one another . Now . Which bunk do you prefer ? The lower or the upper ? &nbsp; RIEBER ( speaking for the first time ; a growl ) I was assured the lower . &nbsp; LOWENTHALVery well . I believe I have been assigned to the lower . But it is yours . What are your habits ? Are you an early riser or a late riser ? I , myself , rise very early in the morning . I have taken boat trips often and I enjoy the morning air .  --  36  --  &nbsp; LOWENTHAL ( Cont . ) If you sleep late , I will see that I do not disturb you . I take it that , if this evening is an example , you are a late bird . I , myself , go to bed early . I take it , you in turn will try your best not to disturb me . For my part , I am willing to do anything to make the voyage as smooth as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush is a little out of line with the rest . Lowenthal moves it a bit so that it is completely symmetrical with the rest . He goes up to his bunk . &nbsp; LOWENTHALOne other thing . In addition to all the obvious disadvantages you must feel about having me for a cabin-mate , I must mention one more . My wife has informed me in the most sarcastic terms possible . I snore . Good night . 57 CLOSEUP - RIEBER He stands there nonplussed . 58 INT . AMPARO 'S CABIN - NIGHT - AMPARO looks wearily around the room . It is obvious she has just had a client . She is putting her negligee back on . There is a knock at the door . Pepe enters . He goes to her , rubs his thumb against his forefinger , gesturing for her to give him money . Amparo hands him bills . Pepe 's attitude is in sharp contrast to the scene with Freytag . He is like any businessman looking after his investment . There is no humor involved in it . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly after she has just had a client . &nbsp; PEPEWhat took you so long ? &nbsp; AMPAROHe kept saying five dollars for one more time .  --  37  --  &nbsp; PEPEYou were a long time at it , even so , you pig . &nbsp; AMPAROIf it were up to you , I 'd spend the whole voyage on my back .

Amparo has already gone into the washroom . &nbsp; PEPEHurry up . &nbsp; AMPARO 'S VOICEI 'm tired .

LA CONDESA ! La Condesa is of indeterminate age . She wears a veil and a black dress . There is great excitement , vitality and mystery about her . She makes her way up the gangplank with great dignity . One or two of the passengers  --  43  --  murmur as they see her walking by them . Then , finally , the murmur grows into high sounds of approval and a cheer . Soon cries of VIVA ! VIVA ! VIVA ! The steerage passengers are aware that La Condesa is aboard .

He takes more from his pocket . &nbsp; WOOD CARVERA dog . Do you think anyone in first class would be interested in buying them ? David holds the object in his hand , looking at it for a moment . 99 EXT . UPPER DECK - DAY Lowenthal and Freytag are walking .

My wife and I have been married for forty years and I do n't think we 've ever been as much in love as we are now . Freytag looks at Lowenthal , moved , and somehow a little reassured . &nbsp; FREYTAGWhat are you in ? Some kind of business ? &nbsp; LOWENTHALI 'm in the jewelry business . But a special part of it . I sell religious trinkets . Any religion . You name it . I got it .  --  57  --  &nbsp; LOWENTHAL ( Cont. ) ( proudly ) I design them myself .

All kinds of religious symbols are shown in their different patterns . 101 MED . SHOT &nbsp; LOWENTHALI have them in earrings , neck chains , bracelets , anklets . &nbsp; FREYTAG ( politely ) Very interesting . &nbsp; LOWENTHALInteresting ? It 's an education ! For instance , do you know why an Arab carries his rug around with him ? People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down that rug , that rug is his temple and he prays to Allah from that spot ! And it 's a good business . People feel better when they wear these things . I feel pretty good , too . With all this stuff on me , I feel like the man in Paris  --  Paris , of all places . He bought from me a crucifix , a Buddha and a mezuzah , all on one chain . Do you know what he said ? He said , " It may not help , but it ca n't hurt . " They walk on .

There 's something about the movement . . . Shall we continue ? Are you game ? He smashes another serve . They start again . This time even more deadly , their faces darkening with blood . As they play , Ric and Rac bear down on them suddenly from behind Lizzi and sail by her without a glance . Lizzi falters , her eyes flash aside . Rieber scores his point . &nbsp; LIZZI ( screams ) Ah , shame ! Rieber laughs a little . &nbsp; LIZZIAh . If it had not been for those stupid children  --  why must these things always happen to me ? &nbsp; RIEBERCome now . Even the best of us must lose sometime . Let 's not mind so much . Remember , it is the playing of the game that counts . Not winning . &nbsp; LIZZIYou can talk . You 've won three games now .  --  59  --  Lifts her paddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; RIEBERThere now . Do n't mind not winning from me . I am ping-pong champion of the Sportsverein in Frankfurt three times over . Shall we play another game ? Or , perhaps I can suggest another game . &nbsp; LIZZIWhat game ? &nbsp; RIEBERAny game . A game you might win . &nbsp; LIZZIWhat game do you mean ? &nbsp; RIEBER ( leers ) Have you no idea ? &nbsp; LIZZI ( inwardly delighted ) I will not let you talk that way to me . She starts . He hits her on her rear with the ping-pong paddle . She turns and looks at him . &nbsp; RIEBERI 'm sorry . I could not resist . Lizzi takes paddle and strikes Rieber in the groin . &nbsp; LIZZII could not resist , either . 102 JENNY AND MARY ON DECK &nbsp; MARYYou have to look for the rainbows .

You have to go to Schiaparelli 's  --  not to buy anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor  --  60  --  hitching their belts down in back every time they turn , and jerk around as though they were run by pushbuttons . Let 's see , what else ? You have to go to La Bagatelle and help the moss roses to open . In cold springs they get stuck  --  poor things  --  halfway . All you do is loosen one petal and there it opens before your eyes ! &nbsp; JENNYIt sounds marvelous . &nbsp; MARYI traveled every year of my childhood to Paris . &nbsp; JENNYWhere are you from originally ? &nbsp; MARYMurray Hills , Virginia . &nbsp; JENNYI was there once on an assignment . It seemed to be a really lovely place . &nbsp; MARYIt was very bad for me . I grew up believing that life was meant to be simple , generous and , above all , gracious . You can see how misleading that was . ( smiles ) Where are you from ? &nbsp; JENNY ( with a hint of apology in her voice ) Minneapolis , Minnesota . &nbsp; MARYWhat do your parents think of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thrilled . It 's something she always wanted to do . ( laughs ) My father gave me up for lost a long time ago . &nbsp; MARYThey usually do these days . ( smiles warmly ) What do your parents do ? &nbsp; JENNYMy father owns a store . It 's a good store . A jewelry store . My mother 's never been satisfield with it . Always wanted to be something more . She wanted to be a lady lawyer . . . ( laughs ) . . . or something like that . She 's the one who prepared me for art school . She told me that a woman had to have something for herself outside of her husband . ( laughs ) Otherwise , it 's bridge parties and one day a week at the hospital . &nbsp; MARYWhat about that young man you 're traveling with ? &nbsp; JENNYDavid ? He 's a painter . A wonderful one , too . At the moment he 's a bit heavy on the social consciousness stuff , but he 'll get over that . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . &nbsp; MARYSerious ? &nbsp; JENNYI 've never felt the way I feel about David with anyone . But I do n't know whether he understands the things we  --  62  --  were talking about before . That a woman has a life of her own , too . ( laughs ) I think David thinks women should follow three paces behind with slippers . &nbsp; MARY ( with bitterness ) I 'm sure he does . They walk a moment . &nbsp; MARYMy husband did . And he had the least reason in the world for feeling that . &nbsp; JENNYWhat did your husband do ? &nbsp; MARYHe was an incompetent newspaperman . Our life was one grand fete . He was jealous of me. ( remembering with almost a smile of satisfaction ) He was so jealous of me that he beat me until I bled at the nose . &nbsp; JENNY ( laughs ) I did n't mean to laugh . I was just wondering whether David would beat me . We quarrel sometimes . It seems to grow out of nothing . Then it grows into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it were there all the time . I guess a relationship between man and woman is a very difficult one these days , is n't it ? &nbsp; MARYYou want to know something ? I never had a relationship with a man I felt was good enough for me.  --  63  --  Section Details 103 EXT . DECK - DAY - ANGLE David is sketching . Glocken is standing beside him , watching . David is attempting to get down on canvas the people in steerage . &nbsp; GLOCKENMagnificent . &nbsp; DAVID ( quietly ) No . It is n't . It 's sentimental . He tears up sketch . Takes a white piece of paper and begins resolutely again . &nbsp; GLOCKEN ( all the more admiringly ) Wonderful . Wonderful . I ca n't tell you how much I admire you . &nbsp; DAVIDWhy ? &nbsp; GLOCKENYou create  --  ! &nbsp; DAVIDI 'm not even sure about that . Nobody 's ever given me a penny for my painting . I met a little man down there who carves little animals out of wood . The figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectualize . He does n't know a Giotto from a Leonardo . &nbsp; GLOCKENI envy you . I envy you your struggle . I envy you your doubts and floundering , even . And Frau Brown , I envy you that , too . &nbsp; DAVID ( laughs ) She 's an attractive girl , is n't she ? &nbsp; GLOCKENAre you two going to be married ? &nbsp; DAVID ( sharply ) What made you ask that ?  --  64  --  &nbsp; GLOCKENI 'm sorry . I do n't mean to pry . It was rude of me . The distasteful curiosity of the non-participant . He turns away . &nbsp; DAVID ( stopping him ) I did n't mean to be sharp . Really . ( pause ) I do n't know whether I 'll ever get married . &nbsp; GLOCKENWhat do you mean ? &nbsp; DAVIDI 'm too selfish . &nbsp; GLOCKENHerr Scott , you do n't mean that . &nbsp; DAVID ( laughs ) I do . This means too much to me. ( indicating canvas ) It does n't leave room for anything else . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GLOCKEN ( sadly ) You mean Miss Brown is n't the right kind of person . &nbsp; DAVID ( ruefully ) What I need is just someone to be there . Who will tell me that I 'm great ; who will tell me that I 'm going to sell this canvas even if I 'm not , who will make me feel I 'm the most important person in the world . Who will want to be part of me , and that will be enough . I do n't know whether Jenny would want to do that . Or even if she did , whether she would be capable of doing it .  --  65  --  &nbsp; GLOCKENI see . I see . ( pause ) I suppose one of the saddest things in the world is to see two people who feel so much for each other and feel they belong together , and yet they really do n't belong together at all . 104 EXT .

It wo n't do , Willie . You take care of yourself . Chess later ? Dr. Schumann nods . Captain Thiele pats Dr. Schumann on the arm . Nods to him and goes .

WILLIE SCHUMANNIt was nothing like theirs . At least , I hope not . &nbsp; CONDESAWhen I was four , I persuaded my little brother to drink lye water used for cleaning drains , telling him it was milk . He went screaming about the house .

On it is a large mass of red cotton roses mixed with shiny tinfoil foliage and lace paper flowers of an unknown species . An outrageous stuffed dove with a few feathers missing is perched beak downward on a stick above the floral arrangements , carrying around its neck a placard bearing the single word , " Homenaje .

Behind him , to the rhythmic strains of a popular bull-fighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ric and Rac bring up the rear . Amparo and Pastora , whose brilliantly smiling faces are masks of black , white and red , wear flimsy red and white-figured cotton gowns with long ruffled trains . Their hair is filled with high tortoise shell combs filled out in front with cotton roses and draped with short black lace mantillas . They glitter with sequined fans , jingle with necklaces , earrings and bracelets of colored glass and ornaments of gold-colored metal . Their skirts , shorter in front , show their beautiful ankles and feet in black lace stockings and red satin high-heeled slippers . Pepe and Manolo wear uniforms of tight high-waisted black trousers , wide red sashes and short black jackets , with thin black dancing pumps with flat ribbon bows .

They clap their hands as he sings and dances in a strong , deep voice , head bent , eyes fixed on his own feet . Someone calls out a theme or a word , he mutters to himself for a moment , then breaks into a long  --  118  --  cry , sings his verse and winds up with a slow , flat-footed dance , backwards and forwards , stamping to the rhythm of the accompanying hands .

In her face is the bitterness she feels at the whole world . The frustration of a misspent life . 315 WIDER ANGLE Mary , exhausted , stops and gets to her feet , feeling that not Denny , but she , has been averted from a shocking end . A steward appears at the head of the passageway . He sees her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meine Dame . What is it ? What happened ? &nbsp; MARY ( faltering ) I was in my cabin . I heard cries .

The people are crowded onto the barge , half scrambling , half falling onto its open deck . A newborn baby is lowered separately onto the barge , many hands reaching for it , as it reaches the barge itself . There should be the feeling of piling onto the barge , which is as crowded as the steerage itself was . In the midst of the crowd , the fat man in the cherry-colored shirt moves forward .
