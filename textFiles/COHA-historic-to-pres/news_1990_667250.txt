" I am a half a world away and can not comfort them , read bedtime stories , or tell them I love them . " - Army Spec . Alyssa Mehl I am a soldier , and I do not cry . I am a mother , and my heart breaks . If I were to die here for my principles , protecting America 's freedoms and interests , I would die wondering , ' What have I taught my children ? What have I taken from them ? ' <p> These are the words of Army Spec . Alyssa Mehl , written about her children , from her post with the 119th Transportation Company in King Abdul Aziz Port , Saudi Arabia . <p> These are the children she left behind : Jonathan , 6 , a budding kindergarten artist whose crayons draw tears and fire . Philip , 4 , who spins a globe in search of mom . And Thomas , 2 , too young to understand . <p> For them , and thousands of others left behind this season , the bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound more melancholy than in the homes of children whose mothers are away . <p> " I ca n't think of a sadder vignette than that of a child at Christmas longing for his mother , " says Washington , D.C. , psychologist Bryant Welch . <p> I am half a world away and I can not comfort them , read bedtime stories , or tell them I love them . <p> It is now up to Tom Mehl to tell them that , in the family 's three-bedroom apartment on the base of Fort Eustis , Va . The Army reservist is the boys ' stepfather ; he married Alyssa , 27 , only last May . Yet he quit his $ 20,000-a- year auto mechanic 's job to play , in his words , " Susie Homemaker " and eke by on $ 850 a month in military take-home pay . Just $ 90 remains in the bank account . <p> " Those guys need somebody here , " says Mehl , 31 , who , to be with the boys , has had to give up eating out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also will be fewer presents . <p> " I wanted to get them an electric train set , but it was too expensive , " Mehl says . Instead , he 'll stuff their stockings with inexpensive radios that he got for a few dollars each as part of a cigarette company promotion . <p> " They 're not getting all the things I was going to give them , " says Mehl , a burly ex-Marine . " That does hurt . " <p> But not as much as when he said good-bye to Alyssa at 4 a.m. on Sept. 27 - the day before Jonathan turned 6 . <p> Fathers often have spent Christmas on the front lines . But " it is unprecedented for ( this ) many mothers to be over there , " says military historian Bettie Morden . <p> What will happen to my children if I die ? ? ? I must be realistic . My kids are one of the greatest joys in my life , but if I should die , whose burden do they become ? There are no easy answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , but being a soldier has taught me to be prepared for any possibility . <p> Until regulations were loosened in 1975 , most pregnant women or those with dependent children were barred from active duty . The Persian Gulf crisis is the first major deployment in which large numbers of mothers are serving . <p> Defense officials say they do n't know how many mothers are among the nearly 400,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Mideast . Women make up 11% of active duty military , 12.5% of reserves and guards . <p> Whatever their numbers , the image of fatigue-clad women kissing their children farewell has unsettled a nation more accustomed to sending its men off to war . <p> Women 's movement or no , Welch says , " To the extent ( that ) the mother is the primary caretaker in the family , it is more devastating to have ( her ) away , especially for young children . " <p> All of America is watching my performance here and that of my sisters . ... We are supposed to be brave . We adapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive tomorrow . We live from day to day , wondering about our future . <p> " There is no such thing as a ' Mr. Mom , ' " says Mehl . " There 's a love from a mom that a dad ca n't give . Moms are the soft things . They 're the ones who take care of the bruises and scrapes . <p> " There 's something I 'm lacking . I try to be both but I ca n't . There 's no way . " <p> But Tom Mehl may underestimate himself . <p> I am a soldier . I am well-trained , confident , honorable and brave . I am part of Operation Desert Shield . My country calls me a hero . I do not cry . <p> Mehl 's voice cracks . He can not keep reading her letter . His lips tremble , his eyes close . A tear slips down to his mustache . <p> He nods to his sons , who play at a table covered with Lego toy building blocks . " These guys know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not as much as me . " <p> " Husbands are now all of a sudden thrown into a new role . Where once I was father , now I am father and mother , " says Army Reserve chaplain Maj. Arthur Bacon of St. Louis . " It 's a little more difficult for a husband to deal with that . " <p> I want to be at home with my family , enjoying our lives . My oldest is in kindergarten . I do not see him onto the bus , make his lunch , or hang his artwork on the refrigerator with a motley collection of magnets . I do not do any of the things that make a mother into a ' Mom . ' I miss him and his brothers very much . <p> Philip is talking about the frozen pizza that Mehl burned . The blackened cheese still coats the bottom of the oven . <p> " It 's only been two days , " protests Mehl , who keeps an upright vacuum cleaner in the living room at all times . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk beds are n't made and four , 2-pound boxes of macaroni sit out , on the microwave . <p> No , it is n't the housework that bothers Mehl . It 's another chore . " I hate dirty diapers . " He tried to toilet-train Thomas . It did n't work , he sighs . <p> I envy you , who sit reading this at home . Yes , I made my choice - and I would again - to become a member of the U.S. Army . Still , I envy you the freedoms I am protecting . <p> Mehl explains these freedoms to the boys " in the essence of a flag . Iraq took Kuwait 's flag and that 's not right . That 's a concept they can understand . " <p> Philip thinks he understands . " My mommy is over there because she needs to fight someone , " he says . " A man is taking away people 's houses . " <p> Jonathan puts his feelings on paper . One drawing shows a tank blowing up a truck that his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , it says : " Dear Mommy . I love you . I miss you . I wish you were here but you 're not because you 're dead . " <p> In life there are many things that are incompatible - being both a mother and a soldier is one . But I must live with the results . We make our own lives , and I am responsible for mine . <p> Tom Mehl misses cooking lasagna with Alyssa in the kitchen or sitting out back on the porch and talking after the kids are in bed . He now sits there alone . <p> " I do a lot of thinking . I look at the stars . ... Almost everytime I look ( at my watch ) I think eight hours different . " <p> Others are keeping Alyssa is mind , too . <p> I get letters from family and friends , and some addressed to ' Any Service Member ' - lifelines thrown to me here . I have an active correspondence with about 35 people . They all ask , ' What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I long to tell them to send a plane ticket home , I need to come home , to be with my children . Instead I ask for chewing gum , books and writing paper - things I do n't really need but that remind me of home . <p> At that home , boys talk of things most men can barely discuss . <p> " Someday they might have to make war , " says Jonathan . " When they fight , they die . " <p> " God makes them come back alive , " says Philip . <p> " No , " corrects his big brother . " They will never come back . " <p> They are little boys who should never learn what war is , especially not by losing their mother to one . They need a mother 's arms to comfort them , and it breaks my heart to know that I am out of reach , that I made the choice to be a soldier , and that I would do it again . I stole from them a part of their childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLIDAY OF WORRY : Thomas Mehl will celebrate Christmas with his stepchildren while his wife Alyssa , right , is in Saudi Arabia .
