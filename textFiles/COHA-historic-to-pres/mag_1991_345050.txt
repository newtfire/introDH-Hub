A retired California Superior Court judge , he was aboard the Sumner , a hydrographic survey ship , on Dec. 7 , 1941 . <P> I was in the officers ' mess ( ( when ) ) the officer of the deck came flying in to say planes were dropping bombs . Within 100 yards was a plane with a big red dot on it . I thought it must be a war game  --  the reds against the blues . <P> We were given credit for shooting down the first Japanese aircraft of the war . One of our old blunderbuss antiaircraft guns lined up one of the planes and hit him . A bomb hit near two destroyers in dry dock . Their seams opened % up , their oil drained out and caught fire , their magazines went off . They were cremated . <P> I was scared to death  --  those bombs exploding and the realization that your life is n't worth much . In four years at sea I sat through 78 air attacks , but nothing was as frightening as the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
