The result of an election to the Dominion , Parliament , announced yesterday , is of scarcely less interest to England and the United States than to Canada itself . The issue was approval or disapproval of Premier LAURIER 'S naval policy in the Premier 's home district . He . had proposed a navy for the uses of Canada itself , for coast defense , and for protection of Canada 's commerce , and subjeCt to the orders of Canada alone . He could not do less by way of contribUting to the Empire 's staggering and growing naval burden , and he is not approvedtin doing ao little . The candidate in behalf of whom he threw his influence was defeated by a humble farmer , of qualifications inferior to his opponent in everything except possession of the confidence of the electorate . In that respect the habitant who could hardly speak English was superior to the Premier himself . The issue was only between- the Nationalists and the Liberals . The Conservatives who favored a more imperialist naval programme did not venture even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier took a similar cold bath when recently he toured the Northwest , and discovered there a sentiment which compelled him to modify his protection policy by undertaking to negotiate reciprocity with the United States . This second icy plunge will embarrass him still more . He was elected on a free-trade platform , and it troubles him hardly at all to say that  --  like the Garfield protectionists  --  he is for that sort of protection which leads to free trade . Probably he can , justify that argument , and be supported in doing what he will assert to be for the benefit of the Dominion regardless of any advantage to the - United States . Even this is nut certain , for the policy of fostering trade relations on this continent was condemned unanimously by the Toronto Board of Trade in resolutions published yesterday , which may be taken as embodying the prevalent ' sentirrient of the Eastern provinces . But assuming that the Premier can succeed in maintaining himself at home on this issue , what will be his , position when he attends the approaching colonial conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultra loyalists of the Empire , and now he is unable to show for it the support of his own constituency after a canvass in which sentiments like these were uttered by Mr. BLONEIlsr , M. P. for Champlain : We owe nothing to Great Britain . - England did not take Canada for love , or - to plant the cross of ' religion as the ' French did , but in order to plant their trading posts and make money . The only liberties we have are those we won by force , and to-day England tries to ' dominate its colonies as imperial Rome once did . The Premier 's constituents seem to have carried his idea that Canadr , is a nation beyond his intention . The check to protectionism and , the triumph . of nationalism can not fail to be noted both In London and Washingtcin . The destiny of this continent is advanced more than would have been thought possible even a few months ago , and is hastened by the events and policies designed to retard it .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
