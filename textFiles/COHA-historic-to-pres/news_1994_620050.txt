At a conference table on the top floor of a Washington , D.C. , highrise , former Representative Bill Gradison laid out his latest worry in the debate over health care reform . <p> " I see the early development of a ' blame game ' strategy , " he told a group of reporters . " If it all goes down , who is at fault ? " <p> Gradison has plenty of reason to be concerned . As President Clinton 's goal of providing health insurance to every American slips deeper into the abyss , many are already crediting lobbyists like Gradison , president of the Health Insurance Association of America ( HIAA ) , with shoving it there . <p> The HIAA has poured $ 14.7 million into its " Harry and Louise " television advertising campaign  --  30-second vignettes in which an earnest , middle-aged , professional couple calmly voice fears about medical rationing and government-run health care . <p> Senator Jay Rockefeller , D- W.Va. , branded the ads " the single most destructive campaign I 've seen in 30 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center for Public Integrity , says they were " almost single-handedly responsible for a 20-point drop in public opinion regarding the Clinton plan . " <p> By any standard , the Harry and Louise campaign has been brilliant and effective . But it represents just a fraction of the efforts on all sides of the health care debate to make points with the public , 535 members of Congress and their staff . <p> Estimates vary substantially as to the amount spent by health care special interests , but the increase has been dramatic since the Clinton administration began crafting its plan . The Center for Public Integrity estimates that since 1993 , more than $ 100 million has been spent to influence the reform process . <p> In popular parlance , lobbying no longer refers just to face-to-face meetings between legislators and representatives of constituent groups . It includes any attempt to influence lawmakers ' votes through media campaigns , direct meetings or campaign contributions . <p> Kathleen Hall Jamieson , dean of the University of Pennsylvania 's Annenberg School of Communications , estimates that before the health reform debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been spent on advertising alone . <p> " Clearly , we 're seeing the most significant example of campaign contributions and lobbying in American history . There 's nothing that compares to this , " said Michael Podhorzer , health care campaign director for Citizen Action , a consumer watchdog . <p> Combing through federal election statements , Citizen Action has concluded that the health care and insurance industries have contributed $ 26 million to congressional campaigns during the 17-month fund-raising cycle ended in May . That is a 40 percent increase over the $ 19 million spent during the comparable period beginning in 1991 . <p> What does all this money buy ? " Access , " Podhorzer said . " Senators and members of Congress are spending a lot more time talking to lawyers representing industries that give campaign contributions than ( to ) average citizens or advocates of reform . " <p> EXCEPTIONALLY VULNERABLE <p> The complex health reform proposals have proven to be exceptionally vulnerable to criticism from lobbyists , who can focus on details their clients find unacceptable . Cumulatively , these objections can tear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health care . That 's why virtually every major health care reform has failed , " said Bob Moffitt , an analyst for the Heritage Foundation , a conservative Washington think- tank . " The more people see , the less they like it . " <p> Representative Richard Lehman , D-Fresno , considered a crucial swing vote on health reform because he represents a conservative district , said the extent of lobbying is no surprise . " Everyone is affected by health care , " he said . " You have to expect those affected to express themselves . " <p> Most of those who visit or call his office , however , are not seeking a simple yes or no vote on reform . " There 's a lot of moving parts in legislation , " Lehman said . " Most of those who lobby are concerned about specific parts . " <p> Members of Congress readily acknowledge the power of political advertising , but most insist that it does not sway them , even if polls show the messages are swaying the public . " The numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Representative Anna Eshoo , D-San Mateo . " Why does Procter &; Gamble advertise as much as they do ? If you push a product , sales will go up . But I ca n't keep my eye on that . I was n't elected to interpret polls daily . " <p> Among the most successful lobbies has been the National Federation of Independent Business , an organization of 600,000 small-business owners that at times seems to be dictating terms of the debate . Vehemently opposed to any requirement that business pay for insurance , the lobby owes much of its success to its skill in targeting wavering lawmakers  --  inundating their offices with calls and faxes  --  as well as its ability to respond quickly to trends . <p> When Clinton and members of Congress began stepping up their praise of the Hawaiian health care system , the federation flew in a small group of restaurant owners and staged a Capitol Hill press conference to air their complaints about the business climate . <p> HIAA president Gradison  --  a Republican congressman from Cincinnati for 18 years  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his are important advisers , which can point out in advance the unintended consequences of complex proposals . " If lobbyists did not exist , " he said in an interview , " we 'd have to invent them . " <p> RESEARCH AND REPUTATION <p> The real work of lobbying is gathering research and developing a reputation as " a credible source of facts , " Gradison said . " Lobbying is sharing of information , trying to educate . " <p> These days , lobbyists are riding a revolution in computer and communications technologies . Like soap companies , they have adopted the most sophisticated tools of Madison Avenue advertising firms , including focus groups and surveys , to identify issues and individuals . <p> " Targeting of advertising increases its effectiveness , " Gradison said . The Harry and Louise ads are a good example : As influential as they were , most Californians never saw them . They were aimed only at selected markets , picked for maximum effect . <p> TARGETING WASHINGTON <p> No single market is more important than Washington , D.C. , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They wake up to advertisements from chiropractors , unions , supporters of Democrat health reform bills and , of course , Harry and Louise . Ads appear during the evening news and before the legislators go to bed . <p> Lobbies now are lobbying against lobbyists . The Health Care Reform Project , a coalition of 57 consumer groups that includes the American Association of Retired Persons , has begun a $ 150,000 television ad campaign in the Washington market featuring a portly man racing through the Capitol with a wheelbarrow full of cash . " How much does it take to kill health reform ? " the narrator asks . <p> Charles Leonard , the coalition 's spokesman , says the money invested against reform has paid off . " The opponents of health care reform have spent a fortune and have bought for themselves time , if not the death of comprehensive reform , " he said . <p> LABOR UNIONS SPEND BIG , TOO <p> Still , lobbyists clearly are exerting influence on all sides of the debate . Labor unions make up the largest group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 30 million during the past four years , according to the Center for Public Integrity . <p> Paul Di Donato has been lobbying Congress on behalf of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation . " We 're working very hard on Senator ( Dianne ) Feinstein , " he said . " At this point , ( the California Democrat ) is not where we want her to be on all the major issues . " <p> Di Donato is discouraged by the trend in the debate , which seems to him to be moving further from serious health reform . " I do n't think it 's a fair game , " he said . " I definitely feel outgunned . If health care goes down the tubes , one thing it will prove is $ 100 million can buy you what you want .
