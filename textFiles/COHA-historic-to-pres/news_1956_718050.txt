Letters to The Times Union Shop Ruling Upheld Court Decision Said to Accord With Railway Act 's Intent The writer of the following letter is the author of " Collective Bargaining in the Railroad Industry " and has contributed articles on railroad labor . relations to various professional journals . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your correspondent Leo . Egan , in The New York Times of June 28 , reports that the Conference of Governors criticized the Supreme Court " for decisions holding a state law , void if a Federal statute dealt with the same subject . " In explaining the background for this criticism mention is made of the fact that the Supreme Court " held that a state law barring the closed shop could not apply to railroad employes because the Federal Railway Labor Act pre-empted the field . " In other words , this case , as well as the decision involving the Pennsylvania law on subversion , apparently provoked this criticism . The Governors ' resolution stated , among other things , " that Federal laws should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-empt any field against state action unless this intent is stated * * * . " With respect to union shop ( and not the closed shop , as mentioned by your correspondent ) provisions of the Railway Labor Act , it is quite evident what the intent of Congress was and there is no basis for using the decision of the Supreme Court in support of the Governors ' resolution . The Railway Labor Act specifically states that union shop agreements are permissible " notwithstanding * * * any * * * ) statute or law * * * of any state * * * . " The Report of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on the union shop specifically recognized the fact that the state laws banning the union shop would be inapplicable if the union shop provision of the Railway Labor Act was approved . The committee set forth various reasons for the necessity of striking down these laws . Furthermore , an examination of the debates in the Senate reveals that virtually the entire debate on the issue was concerned with the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , offered on the floor of the Senate for the purpose of permitting these state laws to apply in the case of the railroad industry , and it is quite obvious that unless such amendment were adopted the state laws would be superseded . Yet the Senate defeated such amendment . Thus it is exceedingly clear that one can not use the decision of the Supreme Court in the railroad union shop case as a basis for criticizing the Supreme Court 's alleged usurpation of power . In fact , the court 's decision is in strict conformance with the Governors ' resolution . JACOB J. KAUFMAN . Buffalo , N. Y. , June 28 , 1956 . Expanding Small Colleges To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The four-year study of higher education recently completed by the Educational Policies Commission of the National Education Association displays all too well a distressing tendency among professional educators to cry for Government aid when private sources have hardly begun to be tapped . The answer to rising enrollments is not to be found in indiscriminate demands for Government aid designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when many excellent private and public institutions already operate at optimum capacity . A better solution would be to finance selectively the expansion of the multitude of small and marginal colleges whose insolvency has prevented growth . The question remains : Does this require an increase in Government aid ? Well established state universities are currently acquiring development techniques which for years have enabled the better private institutions to raise the necessary funds . Coupled with this is the growing concern for education displayed by private individuals , corporations and family triists . Before submitting to what is perhaps a minority sentiment in the N. E. A. , legislators should be encouraged to consider a gradual reallocation ( and I stress the word gradual ) of already existing tax appropriations from increasingly self-sufficient ' state universities to financially handicapped colleges where the growth potential for expansion lies . JOHN P. HALSTEAD , Director of Development , Radcliffe College , Cambridge , Mass. , July 2 , 1956 . President 's Views Praised To Tus EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : What President Eisenhower said about neutrality and Secretary Dulles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political thinking and how the President innately is ahead of the field . His genius for fairness and moral verity is unmatched in the political forum of modern times . He realizes that against the evil ideology of communism we can at present only set up a none-too-perfect ideology of our own . Just as communism is a form of government based upon a lust ' for political power , glory and wealth , in. the American way we see individuals are dominated too much by similar objectives . . What , then , is a newly formed government to choose from ? They can not go along 100 per cent with our ideology . They are opposed to the ideology of communism ; so they have a perfect right to sit back and listen . What Mr. Dulles has to offer it the old threat of war and the need for their own salvation , and of course power politics must carry on till the world responds to higher moral values ; so in a measure both the President 's stand and Secretary Dulles ' stand , paradoxical though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As moral poli ? ties grow , power politics will fade ; there are agencies already at work ; on this moral advancement and when formulated and disseminated the President will have a world climate in keeping with his advanced ideas , and success will than crown his efforts at last . CHARLES C. PLATT . New York , June 29 , 1956 . Origins of Poznan Riots Uprising Believed Spontaneous Ad of Desperate Workers To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Prof. Joseph Sulkowski 's letter published July 3 makes strange reading . He casts doubts on spontaneous origins of the Poznan riots . The Communists in Warsaw follow the same line . He regrets the State Department 's preoccupation with the issue of Poland 's liberation and links it with the Senate 's proposals to set aside funds for subversive activities . The two issues can not be linked . One is political and is based upon principles of self-determination of nations . The other is functional and was forced upon this country by Soviet-enforced rule in Eastern Europe . But the Communists in Warsaw and elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interference in the affairs of other states . " The Poznan riots were a desperate , unorganized and fully . spontaneous act of industrial workers . In their factories they have to work harder and longer hours than ever before . In their homes they have less food and clothing for their fam ? ilies and less peace of mind than ever before . By going out into the street these Poznan men wanted to convey to the , outside world one message only . No free man , they shouted at the top of their voices , can live under communism . The message was heard and properly understood by the outside world , in spite of Professor Sulkowski 's interpretation . Socialists , conservatives , diplomats and trade unionists joined hands all over the world in expressing their solidarity with men fighting for their rights and for their freedom . And the greatest triumph of the Poznan rioters was securing the State Department 's declaration , which once again reaffirmed America 's determination to seek national independence for the captive peoples of Europe . Should Mr. Sulkowski be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regime as an excuse to re- , verse the recent trend toward liberalization , it will be another . indication that communism can not afford to operate freely . There is , however , a grave doubt in my mind whether your correspondent genuinely believes in the possibility of " a gradual democratization of the Communist - controlled countries . " Democratic freedoms and Communist totalitarianism are incompatible . The Poznan riots were dramatic manifestations of this statement . ZYGMUNT NAGORSKI Jr . Bronxville , N. Y. , July 3 , 1956 . Parking Lots in Central Park To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : ' In the article published June 27 about the proposed parking lot to be constructed in the park for the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Commissioner Robert Moses was quoted as saying at a Council meeting at City Hall " that providing parking space in the park for the museum and the Tavern on the Green involved the same principle . " I would like to respectfully point out to Commissioner Moses that , on the contrary , the two situations can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used by the general public . Further , it can be cited as a worth-while project be ? cause it is to be used in connection with a cultural institution . On the other hand , the portion of the park which is to be sacrificed as a parking lot for the Tavern on the Green will only be used by people who patronize the tavern . That in. volves only a very limited number of people , those who are in a position to be able to afford to eat there . It seems to me that if portions of the park must be converted into parking lots , this should only be done for places which will be of benefit to everyone . MARION CITBIN . New York , June 27 , 1958 ,
