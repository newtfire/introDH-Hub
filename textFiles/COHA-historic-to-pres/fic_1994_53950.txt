LONG BEFORE THE DUST Witch who traveled with Dark 's Pandemonium Shows , there was another . Born into death more than two thousand years earlier  --  three hundred years before the Crown of Thorns , the Gethsemane Garden , and the empty Tomb . <p> By born into death I mean the original skin-and-bones of Nef , grandmother to Nefertiti . Beautiful long before the birth into life of the handsome princess whose one-eyed bust resides in world museums , purchasable for a few dollars plus thirty pounds of synthetic marble . <p> This Dust Witch , this royal mummy , drifted on a dark boat past the empty Mount of the Sermon , scraped over the Rock at Plymouth and land-sailed to Little Fort in upper Illinois , surviving Grant 's twilight assaults and Lee 's pale dawn retreats . <p> One family owned their ancestor , this particular Egyptian mummy , this great times twenty-two greats Grandma . They shipped her over land in a thin stone sarcophagus from which she was evicted when the tomb was needed for family baths . <p> Stashed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lifted , light as balsa wood , to the upper attics where she was covered , smothered , then ignored by a family , eager for survival and forgetful of unremembered deaths ' leftovers . Abandoned to attic silence and the drift of golden pollens on the air , sucking in darkness as sustenance , breathing out only quiet and serenity , this ancient visitor waited for someone to pull aside the accumulated love letters , toys , melted candles and candelabra , tattered skirts , corsets , and headlined papers from wars won-then-lost in instantly neglectful Pasts . <p> The day for her rebirth came one hundred years after the shot that killed Lincoln and stilled history . <p> Nef from the mysterious Isle arose into the light because someone had come and leafed through , dug and tossed aside until just her head , her face , her sewn-shut eyes were framed in autumn book leaves , legal tracts and jack-straw mouse-bones . <p> And it was Timothy Light , son of Jonathan and Priscilla Dark , who found and stared down upon her . <p> " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer were expected . " Why are you here ? " he asked . <p> And reply the old lost woman did . <p> " I , " she whispered . <p> Timothy stiffened . <p> " Am , " murmured the dust in the old woman 's lips . <p> " What ! ? " Timothy bent so the dust touched his ear . <p> " Nef , " came the filtering , blowing whisper behind the sewn-shut eyes and the dry riverbed mouth . <p> " Nef ! ? " Timothy had heard the name , remembered the name from ten years before when he was three . <p> " Your , " whispered the crumbs of sand falling from the edges of her mouth , " long , " she murmured , " lost , " she whispered , " an . . . ces . . . tor . " <p> " Ca n't be ! " <p> " Issssss . . . " said the faint crack beginning to appear in the bas-relief mouth . <p> " No ! " <p> " Not . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice , a ventriloquist 's thrown-syllables from two thousand years of quiet echoes . " You . . . will . . . shatter . . . me . " <p> And indeed platelets of dry sand fell from her bandaged shoulders , hieroglyphs tattered on her breastplate . <p> " How did you get here ? " said Timothy at last . <p> " Rather , " she said , " ask who . . . called you . . . here ? " <p> " Who ? ! " he shouted . <p> " . . . softly . . . " she said . <p> " Who ? " he said softly . <p> " I , " said the Dust Witch . <p> " Nobody called . " <p> " And yet you heard . " The old woman spoke more clearly now , with many syllables and many words . <p> " Look . . . " <p> A tiny spiral of dust brushed along her ciphered bosom where gods of life and death posed as stiffly as tall rows of ancient corn and wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? " whispered her voice . <p> " That . " He touched the face of a child sprang up in a field of holy beasts . " Me ? " <p> " Indeed . " <p> " Then it was n't just me searching ? I was meant to find you ? Why ? " <p> " Be . . . cause . . . it . . . is . . . the . . . end . " The slow words fell like golden crumbs from her lips . <p> A rabbit thumped and ran in Timothy 's chest . <p> " End of what ? " <p> One of the sewn eyelids of the ancient woman gave the merest crack open to show a crystal gleam tucked within . Timothy glanced up at the attic beams where that gleam touched its light . <p> " This ? " he said . " Our place ? " <p> " . . . yesssss . . . " came the whisper . She sewed one eyelid back up , but opened the other with light . " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Her fingers , trembling across the pictographs on her bosom , touched like a spider here , then there as she whispered : <p> " This . . . " <p> Timothy responded . " Uncle Einar ! " <p> " He who has wings ? " <p> " I 've flown with him . " <p> " Fortunate child . And this ? " <p> " My sister . Cecy ! " <p> " She also flies ? " <p> " With no wings . She sends her mind out  --  " <p> " Like ghosts ? " <p> " Which enters people 's ears to look out their eyes ! " <p> " Fortunate girl . And this ? " The spider fingers trembled . <p> There was no symbol where she pointed . <p> " Ah . " Timothy laughed . " My cousin , Ran . Invisible . Does n't need to fly . Can go anywhere and no one knows . " <p> " Fortunate man . And this and this and yet again <p> Her dry finger moved and scratched . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nieces and nephews who had lived in this house forever , or a hundred years , give or take bad weather , storms , or war . There were thirty rooms and each more filled with cobweb and nightbloom and sneezes of ectoplasms that posed in mirror to be blown away when deaths ' head moths or funeral dragonflies sewed the air and flung the shutters wide to let the dark spill in . <p> Timothy named each hieroglyphic face and the ancient woman gave the merest nod of her dusty head as her fingers lay on a final hieroglyph . <p> " Do I touch the maelstrom of darkness ? " she asked . <p> " This house , yes . " <p> And it was so . There lay this very house , embossed with lapis lazuli and trimmed with amber and gold , as it must have been when Lincoln went unheard at Gettysburg . <p> And as he gazed , the bright embossments began to shiver and flake . An earthquake shook the frames and blinded the golden windows . <p> " Tonight , " mourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , " cried Timothy , " after so long . Years . Why now ! " <p> " It is the age of discovery and revelations . The pictures that fly through the air . The sounds that blow in the winds . Things seen by many . Things heard by all . Travelers on the road by the tens of millions . No escape . We have been found by the words in the air and the pictures sent on light beams into rooms where children and children 's parents sit while Medusa , with insect antennae coifs , tells all and seeks punishment . " <p> " For what ? " <p> " No reason is needed . It is just the revelation of the hour , the meaningless alarms and excursions of the week , the panic of the single night , no one asks , but death and destruction are delivered , as the children sit with their parents behind them , frozen in an Arctic spell of unwanted gossip and unneeded slander . No matter . The dumb will speak , the stupid will assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " she echoed . <p> And the house on her bosom and the house beams above the boy shook , waiting for more quakes . <p> " The floods will soon arrive . . . inundations . Tidal waters of men . . . " <p> " What have we done ? " <p> " Nothing . We have survived all . And those that come to drown us are envious of our lives for so many centuries . Because we are different , we must be washed away . Hist ! " <p> And again her hieroglyphs shook and the attic sighed and creaked like a ship in a rising sea . <p> " What can we do ? " Timothy asked . <p> " Escape to all directions . They can not follow so many flights . The house must be vacant by midnight when they come with torches . " <p> " Torches ? " <p> " Is n't it always fire and torches , torches and fire ? " <p> " Yes . " Timothy felt his tongue move , stunned with remembrance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running after . And torches and fire . " <p> " Well then . Call your sister . Cecy must warn all the rest . " <p> " This I have done ! " cried a voice from nowhere . <p> " Cecy ! ? " <p> " She is with us , " husked the old woman . <p> " Yes ! I 've heard it all , " said the voice from the beams , the window , the closets , the downward stairs . " I am in every room , in every thought , in every head . The bureaus are being ransacked and the luggage packed . Long before midnight , the house will be empty . " <p> A bird unseen brushed Timothy 's eyelids and ears and settled behind his gaze to blink out at Nef . <p> " Indeed , the Beautiful One is here , " said Cecy , using Timothy 's throat and mouth . <p> " Nonsense ! Would you hear another reason why the weather will change and the floods will come ? " <p> " Indeed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his windowed eyes , eager for response . " Tell us , Nef . " <p> " They hate me because I am the accumulation of the knowledge of death . That knowledge is a burden to them instead of a proper responsibility . " <p> " Can , " started Timothy , and Cecy finished , " can death be remembered ? " <p> " Oh , yes . But only by the dead . You the living are blind . But we who have bathed in Time , and been reborn as children of the earth and inheritors of Eternity , drift gently in rivers of sand and streams of darkness , knowing the bombardment from the stars whose emanations have taken millions of years to rain upon the land and seek us out in our plantations of eternally wrapped souls like great seeds beneath the marbled layers and the bas-relief skeletons of reptile birds that fly on sandstone , with wingspreads a million years wide and as deep as a single breath . We are the keepers of Time . You who walk the earth , know only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhalation . Because you move and live , you can not keep . We are the granaries of dark remembrance . Our funerary jars keep not only our lights and silent hearts , but our wells , deeper than you can imagine , where the subterrane of lost hours , all the deaths that ever were , the deaths on which mankind has built new tenements of flesh and ramparts of stone moving ever upward even as we sink down and down , doused in twilights , bandaged by midnights . We accumulate . We are wise with farewells . Would you not admit , child , that forty billion deaths are a great wisdom , and those forty billion who shelf under the earth are a great gift to the living so that they might live ? " <p> " I guess . " <p> " Do not guess , child . Know . I will teach , and that knowledge , important to living because only death can set the world free to be born again . That is your sweet burden . And tonight is the night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , the bright medal in the center of her golden breast flared . The light blazed up to swarm the ceiling like a thousand summer bees threatening , by their very flight and friction , to fire the dry beams . The attic seemed to spin with the rash-around light and heat . Every slat , shingle , crossbeam groaned and expanded , while Timothy raised his arms and hands to ward off the swarms , staring at the kindled bosom of Nef . <p> " Fire ! " he cried , " torches ! " <p> " Yes , " hissed the old , old woman . " Torches and fire . Nothing stays . All bums . " <p> And with this , the architecture of the long-before Gettysburg Appomattox house smoked on her breastplate . <p> " Nothing stays ! " cried Cecy , everywhere at once , like the fireflies and summer bees bumping to char the beams . " All goes ! " <p> And Timothy blinked and bent to watch the winged man and the sleeping girl ( Cecy ) and the Unseen Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds or snowstorms , or wolves running in fields of black wheat , or bats in wounded zigzag flights devouring the moon , and a double dozen of other aunts and uncles and cousins striding the road away from town . Or soaring , to lodge in trees a mile off and safe , as the mob , the torchlit madness , flowed up old Nef-Mum 's chest , while off out the window you could see the real ones , the mob with torches heading like a flow of lava , on foot , bike , and car , a storm of cries choking their throats . <p> Even as Timothy felt the floorboards shift , like scales from which weights are dropped , with seventy times a hundred pounds in flight they jumped overboard from porches . The house skeleton , shaken free , grew tall as winds vacuumed the now empty rooms and flapped the ghost curtains and sucked the front door wide to welcome the torches and fire and the crazed mob in . <p> " All goes , " cried Cecy , a final time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minds and , restored to her body below , ran so lightly , quickly her feet left no tread in the grass . <p> " Now , " said old Nef . " You be my savior , child . Lift and carry . " <p> " Ca n't ! " cried Timothy . <p> " I am dandelion seed and thistledown . Your breath will drift , your heartbeat sustain me . Now ! " <p> And it was so . With one exhalation , a touch of his hands , the wrapped gift from long before Saviors and parted Red Seas arose on the air . And seeing he could carry this parcel of dream and bones , Timothy wept and ran . <p> From a mile beyond the house , which was now a pyre letting sparks and plumes darken the sky to storm-cloud the moon , Timothy stopped under a tree where many of his cousins and perhaps Cecy caught their breath , even as a rickety jalopy braked and a farmer peered out at the distant blaze and the nearby child . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning house . <p> " Wish I knew , " said Timothy . <p> " What you carrying , boy ? " <p> The man scowled at the bindle under Timothy 's elbow . <p> " Collect ' em , " said Timothy . " Old newspapers . Comic strips . Old magazines . Headlines , heck , some before the Rough Riders . Some before Bull Run . Trash and junk . " The bindle under his arm rustled in the night wind . " Great junk , swell trash . " <p> " Just like me , once . " The farmer laughed quietly . " No more . " <p> And he drove away . <p> THERE WAS a tap at the door and Dwight William Alcott looked up from a display of photographs just sent on from some digs outside Karnak . He was feeling especially well fed , visually , or he would not have answered the tap . He nodded , which seemed signal enough , for the door opened immediately and a bald head moved in . <p> " I know this is curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child here ... " <p> " That is curious , " said D.W. Alcott . " Children do not usually come here . He has no appointment ? " <p> " No , but he insists that after you see the gift he has for you , you 'll make an appointment , then . " <p> " An unusual way to make appointments , " mused Alcott . " Should I see this child ? A boy , is it ? " <p> " A brilliant boy , so he tells me , bearing an ancient treasure . " <p> " That 's too much for me ! " The curator laughed . " Let him in . " <p> " I already am . " Timothy , half inside the door , scuttled forward with a great rattling of stuffs under his arm . <p> " Sit down , " said D.W. Alcott . <p> " If you do n't mind , I 'll stand . She might want two chairs , sir , however . " <p> " Two chairs ? " <p> " If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra chair , Smith . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> And two chairs were brought and Timothy lifted the long balsa-light gift and placed it on both chairs where the bundled stuffs shown in a good light . <p> " Now , young man  --  " <p> " Timothy , " supplied the boy . <p> " Timothy , I 'm busy . State your business , please . " <p> " Yes , sir . " <p> " Well ? " <p> " Two thousand four hundred years and 900 million deaths , sir . . . " <p> " My God , that 's quite a mouthful . " D.W. Alcott waved at Smith . " Another chair . " The chair was brought . " Now you really must sit down , son . " Timothy sat . " Say that again . " <p> " I 'd rather not , sir . It sounds like a lie . " <p> " And yet , " said D.W. Alcott , slowly , " why do I believe you ? " <p> " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curator of the museum leaned forward to study the pale and intense face of the boy . <p> " By God , " he murmured , " you do . " <p> " And what have we here , " he went on , nodding to what appeared to be a catafalque . <p> " It looks like a bunch of old papers , " said the boy , unblinking and looking only at the museum gentleman . " But it 's papyrus , sir . " <p> " You know the name papyrus ? " <p> " Everyone knows that . " <p> " Boys , I suppose . Having to do with robbed tombs and Tut . Boys know papyrus . " <p> " Yes , sir . Come look , if you want . " <p> The curator wanted , for he was already on his feet . <p> He arrived to look down and probe as through a filing cabinet , leaf by leaf of cured tobacco , it almost seemed , with here and there the head of a lion or the body of a hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped as if struck in the chest . <p> " Child , " he said and let out another breath . " Where did you find these ? " <p> " This , not these , sirs . And I did n't find it , it found me . Hide and seek in a way , it said . I heard . Then it was n't hidden anymore . " <p> " My God , " gasped D.W. Alcott , using both hands now to open " wounds " of brittle stuff . " Does this belong to you ? " <p> " It works both ways , sir . It owns me , I own it . We 're family . " <p> The curator glanced over at the boy 's eyes . " Again , " he said . " I do believe . " <p> " Thank God . " <p> " Why do you thank God ? " <p> Because if you did n't believe me , I 'd have to leave . " The boy edged away . <p> " No , no , " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you speak as if this , it , owned you , as if you are related ? " <p> " Because , " said Timothy . " It 's Nef , sir . " <p> " Nef ? " <p> Timothy reached over and folded back a tissue of bandage . <p> From deep under the openings of papyrus , the sewn-shut eyes of the old old woman could be seen , with a hidden creek of vision between the lids . Dust filtered from her lips . <p> " Nef , sir , " said the boy . " Mother of Nefertiti . " <p> The curator wandered back to his chair and reached for a crystal decanter . <p> " Do you drink wine , boy ? " <p> " Not until today , sir . " <p> Timothy sat for a long moment , waiting , until Mr. D.W. Alcott handed him a small glass of wine . They drank together and at last Mr. D.W. Alcott said : <p> " Why have you brought this  --  it  --  her  --  here ? " <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The curator nodded . " True . Are you offering , " he paused . " Nef . For sale ? " <p> " No , sir . " <p> " What do you want , then ? " <p> " Just that if she stays here , sir , that once a day , you talk to her . " Embarrassed , Timothy looked at his shoes . <p> " Would you trust me to do that , Timothy ? " <p> Timothy looked up . " Oh , yes , sir . If you promised . " <p> Then he went on , raising his gaze to fix on the curator . <p> " More than that , listen to her . " <p> " She talks , does she ! " <p> " A lot , sir . " <p> " Is she talking , now ? " <p> " Yes , but you have to bend close . I 'm used to it , now . After a while , you will be , too . " <p> The curator shut his eyes and listened . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkled his face , listening . " What ? " he asked . " What is it she , mainly , says ? " <p> " Everything there is to say about death , sir . " <p> " Everything ? " <p> " Two thousand four hundred years , like I said , sir . And 900 million people who had to die so we can live . " <p> " That 's a lot of dying . " <p> " Yes , sir . But I 'm glad . " <p> " What a terrible thing to say ! " <p> " No , sir . Because if they were alive , we would n't be able to move . Or breathe . " <p> " I see what you mean She knows all that , does she ? " <p> " Yes , sir . Her daughter was the Beautiful One Who Was There . So She is the One Who Remembers . " <p> " The Ghost that tells a flesh and soul complete history of the Book of the Dead ? " <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " added Timothy . <p> " And ? " <p> " If you do n't mind , any time I want a Visitors Card . " <p> " So you can come visit any time ? " <p> " After hours , even . " <p> " I think that can be arranged , son . There will be papers to be signed , of course , and authentication carried out . " The boy nodded . The man rose . <p> " Silly of me to ask . Is she still talking ? " <p> " Yes , sir . Come close . No , closer . " <p> The boy nudged the man 's elbow , gently . <p> Far off near the temple of Karnak , the desert winds sighed . Far off , between the paws of a Great Lion , the dust settled . <p> " Listen , " said Timothy . <p> <p> By Ray Bradbury <p> Ray Bradbury 's fiction has been a staple of this magazine since the Winter/Spring 1950 issue . He has written hundreds o/short stories , a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Martian Chronicles , We are pleased that he has again returned to these page <p> " From the Dust Returned " contains a link to another wonderful Bradbury novel , Something Wicked This Way Comes . <p>
