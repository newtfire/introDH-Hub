Until 1946 she was a Roman Catholic teaching nun in India , devout , dynamic , but apparently otherwise unexceptional . Then , on a train ride to Darjeeling , she felt the touch of a divine command . Its message : she must quit her cloistered existence and plunge into Calcutta 's clamorous slums to care for " the poorest of the poor . " <P> She did just that , leaving the genteel girls ' school where she had been teaching to create a new order among the poor of India 's most desolate city . <P> The Missionaries of Charity have since grown into a worldwide order numbering more than 1,800 nuns , 250 brothers and thousands of lay " co-workers " who serve the sick , the lonely , the destitute and the dying in 30 countries . <P> Last week Mother Teresa of Calcutta , 69 , was awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize for Peace . <P> Tiny , gray-eyed , her face deeply seamed with the passing years , Mother Teresa received the news with characteristic lack of fuss in the Missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of international honors , and though this one carried the biggest stipend so far-$190,000-she took it in stride . " Personally , I am unworthy , " she said in her first response to the award . <P> " I accept in the name of the poor , because I believe that by giving me the prize they 've recognized the presence of the poor in the world . " The new Nobel prizewinner will use the money to build more hospices , " especially for the lepers . " <P> Mother Teresa was born in 1910 to Albanian parents and baptized Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in what is now Skoplje , Yugoslavia . Even at the age of twelve she wanted to " go out and give the love of Christ . " By the time she was 18 , Agnes had joined the Irish branch of Loreto nuns who were working in Calcutta , where she soon began teaching geography at St. Mary 's High School . <P> When the church granted her permission to lay aside her Loreto habit and take up the blue-edged , coarse cotton white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young women from St. Mary 's soon joined her . <P> For every kind of tragedy in the overcrowded city , Mother Teresa and her nuns managed to create a measure of consolation . They collected abandoned babies from gutters and garbage heaps and tried to nurse them back to health . They brought in the dying so they might die under care and among friends . Eventually the order built leprosariums , children 's homes , havens for women , the handicapped and the old . The deepest consolation offered , though , was something that went beyond physical care . " For me each one is an individual , " Mother Teresa once explained . " I can give my whole heart to that person for that moment in an exchange of love . It is not social work . We must love each other . It involves emotional involvement , making people feel they are wanted . "
