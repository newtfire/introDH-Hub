Headnote In this excerpt from his new book , Ten Points , our executive editor finds that sometimes your only chance to escape your past is to race toward it as fast as you can . by Bill Strickland One evening in the fall of 2003 , after watching her father finally score a single point after a full season of getting thrashed in a kcal series of training races , Bill Strickland 's daughter made one of those spontaneous , nonsensical statements that pop out of the mouths of four-year-olds : " Nextyear , " she said , " you 'll score 10 points . " * That simple sentence turned into a life-changing quest for our executive editor . An experienced , skilled , but spectacularly mediocre cyclist in terms of physical ability , he knew that , although the Thursday Night Crit was just a training race , scoring 10 points against its pack of pro racers , national and world champs , Olympic medalists , ex-pros and outright legends would be impossible for him . And precisely because it was impossible , he immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped that by scoring 10 points he could show his daughter that through willpower and willingness to sacrifice , dreams could come true . But he also believed his race for 10 points might be the crucible that could finally destroy the demon that lived inside him , allowing him for the first time in his life to become the husband he always wished he could be , and the father he wished he 'd had . That season full of hope and hypoxia turned into the memoir Ten Points ( hyperionbooks.com ) , which is excerpted here . WITH 13 LAPS LEFT IN THE FIFTH CRIT , Jack Simes insinuated himself into a space I had n't known existed . His front wheel appeared between the blurring parallel circles made by my feet and the rider to my right . An inch either way , and our pedals would have shredded the spokes from Simes 's wheel . The left drop of his handlebar slid forward across my hip . His shoulder did not so much bump mine as appear off of it like a shadow , then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his became the dominant , real , material thing . Despite his elegance , there in the middle of the 92-racer pack-the biggest of the season-I almost did n't recognize Simes . I thought he must have been someone who looked like himself , because the real Jack Simes III was ordained to sit up front . His father was the 1936 national road champion . Jack had gone to three Olympics and eight world championships , had won nine national championships and set three American cycling records . He was a short , wiry man with white hair and a craggy face , and thin white calves streaked with black , red and purple veins . Off the bike , you 'd call him irascible . In the saddle of his ancient , white-steel Colnago , he was poetry-riding with a lyricism just about anyone could appreciate , but that regular people could n't really follow . I caught his wheel , popping a hard and crude elbow to drive off my twin , the other rider who 'd been displaced so artfully , and just as the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut , I fit myself through . With his slight , yet unopposable grace , a style that created rather than exploited breaches , Simes started transferring us through the pack faster than I had imagined was possible . He never had to pause to look for an opening or plan a route . He just birthed and passed through gap after gap after gap . And each time he vanished into the wall of riders in front of us , I clenched my teeth and sprinted after him . Twice , there was the slithery zinging sound of wheels touching wheels . Once I smelled burnt rubber . Simes sat up . We were at the front , in a group of about 12 . There was Torch-Bruce Donaghy-a six-time national champ who 'd been a member of the Boycott Olympics team in 1980 . There was Bobby Lea , the kid , the new national champion of the kilometer , a timed solo race called the kill-ometer because it 's generally agreed to be the most physically excruciating single minute in cycling . There was 15-year-old Jack Simes IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Sarah Uhl , a 20-year-old national champ . The Animal-Paul Pearson . Speedy , a local pro more respected than liked . Art " the Dart " McHugh , a goofy , lovable Jekyll with a Hyde sprint . There was Gibby " the Bear " Hatton , who 'd coached Many Nothstein to a gold medal in the match sprint at the 2000 Olympics and who , legend had it , before retiring had made a fortune as the dirtiest , meanest superstar villain ever in keirin-a Japanese form of velodrome racing in which spectators gamble on bikers as if they are horses . As a group , they already had more than a hundred points between them , though it was only May . I had n't even been able to finish a race with the pack yet , let alone score a point . Gibby moved alongside me , crowding me with his thigh , his forearm , elbow , shoulder and even with his breath . He pushed me sideways off Simes . It was a forceful , cruel , crushing and unstoppable move-but steady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half out in the wind . The left side of my face could feel the heat emanating from Gibby 's grizzly bulk . The right side was chilled by the spring wind . I swallowed and kicked up my cadence and got ready to lay myself into the Bear-to push him sideways so I could take back Simes 's wheel . Gibby moved me over again . Some invisible , undetectable flick I had n't felt had put me fully out in the wind . My eyes stung . I put a furious , blurring effort into my cadence and hit 130 rpm , more than two pedal strokes a second . Beside me , tucked into the pack , Gibby was coasting . I popped against his shoulder and bounced back off . There was no way through him . I sat up to begin drifting back to the soft middle of the pack , where I could burrow in to hide from the wind . The bell rumbled into us . We 'd crossed the line to start a points lap . As if I were following Simes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stomped a pedal , blindly shooting forward . The bell was still banging as the 12 of us skittered into the first corner . I stayed up on my pedals , and when I flicked my eyes to the left there was no one beside me . I was alone , off the front . All alone . I sat , but kept my feet going . I blew all the air out of my lungs . I looked back . You were not supposed to . You were supposed to ride off as if you did n't need to look back . The pack was 15 feet behind me . I accelerated all the way to the twisty approach to the hill then pounced again , out of the saddle and smashing my legs onto the pedals . The crest of the hill shook from side to side , as if an earthquake had struck . Something scalding and sulfurous filled my throat . I sat down trembling and snuck a peek back . Bobby Lea was on my wheel . I yawed over to the left and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and saw Sarah Uhl behind him . As she rode up beside me , I could see her looking over , studying me , trying to figure out who I was , this heaving , hurting guy out in front of the pack . She tipped her head up once at me , half a nod . I gave her a half nod back , and she flicked out a smile that fell somewhere between an acknowledgment and a welcome . I slid back and fell in behind her . Bobby pulled to the top of the hill , then heeled left and began drifting back and Sarah took the lead . As Bobby went by , he looked over at me and I looked over at him , thinking it might be unnerving to bluff my face into the same look Sarah had had on hers : So who are you ? Bobby Lea grinned . It was a genuine , young , toothy , bright smile full of energy and careless elation . The kid was having a blast . Our speed washed us forward . We surfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own making . Within a few pedal strokes , the pavement began rushing under our wheels as if we were hovering motionless over a mad river . Then , weightless entirely , we felt ourselves loosed from the puny forces of gravity and propulsion . Down the hill and through the curves with one national champion ahead of me and another behind , we were free , light , pure light . We were faster than light , and as boundless . Then Sarah flapped her right elbow , letting me know she was done , and she pulled over to the left and the wind smashed into my face . I DID N'T CRY WHEN HE BROKE MY NOSE WITH A HAMMER . I was behind him , leaning against his shoulder as he squatted over whatever it was we were working on out there in the garage , the thing that had become that day 's pivotal match against the world that wanted to beat us into submission . A bolt that had rusted stuck , a store that demanded too much for a pair of pants , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who scared me-they were all the same battle for my father . " Fuck it , " he said and , without rising from his squat , he turned at the waist and brought the hammer around and , almost casually , popped me between the eyes . There was a strobe flash of light . A single , sharp snap . An immediate , internal sense of something coming apart . Narrow , wet , scalding lines drilled down both sides of my nose . My father stood . He looked down , chewed one side of his mouth and studied me . The weight of the hammer in his hand swung his arm in tight little pendulums . I could taste the metal tang of the tool at the back of my throat . The hot flow widened , spread sticky and shallow and cooler across my cheeks . I reached up , dipped my index finger against my face then tilted it backward , filling half my field of vision with red . I moved my hand up to the bridge of my nose to press myself back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to attach to my forehead , moved up , down , in . I did not cry . I waited to see if my father might somehow turn this into a joke . He could make a lot of things funny . At the end of one of the hammer 's backward arcs he released it and it clattered onto something metal behind him then clunked blunt onto the concrete floor . " We have to clean this up , " he said . In the bathroom , he set me up on the sink . Blood began wicking down my T-shirt and flowing faster and squiggly along the skin of my chest into the waistband of my jeans . I brought my legs together so my thighs would catch the blood that dripped off my nose and chin whenever I leaned forward . My father took a stack of towels from the closet and piled them on the counter . When my mother did laundry , she 'd fold each washcloth into the center of a matching towel . My father opened a towel , and pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was straggly on the edges and thin enough to see light through in the middle . He refolded it , and laid it back in the towel and closed the towel on itself again and set it aside . He opened another towel , and rejected the washcloth and packed it up and set it aside and opened another . Another . Another , each examination deliberate and patient , the towels in two neat towers , and finally he found a washcloth he wanted , a soft , thick , blue one , as if that was our family 's broken-nose washcloth , the one we retrieved every time someone 's nose got smashed with a hammer . My father ran the faucet hot , and soaked the cloth in the steaming water and wrung it out and laid it against my nose , soft , and warm , and tender , and it was then that I cried , a single throat-bruising sob that pushed out of me like vomit and opened the way for a long , trilling wail that pulsed out of me like blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt , and because I was loved , and because there was no way anymore to separate the two . I GASPED FOR BREATH under the crush of the wind , then got tossed backward . Sarah Uhl and Bobby Lea rode away , kids playing , down the hill and into the woods , their whole lives ahead of them , this lap nothing but one more romp temporarily enlivened by a puzzling , intense man who 'd suddenly blown up less than half a mile away from getting points , and who would be forgotten by next week if not tonight . The good guys whistled past me , and then the rest of the field , and I tucked into them , determined not to abandon in the woods again . But I could n't even keep up back there , amid the softest , weakest part of the pack , where no one had any chance at all of going fast while they were smiling .
