Easter My earliest memory of Easter was when I was five years old and looking for Easter eggs in my grandparents ' backyard . I 'm not sure if what I 'm remembering is the event itself or the photograph of it my father took  --  my brother , Roger , and me , dressed in our Sunday suits , pausing just long enough from our egg gathering to record the moment for posterity . My grandmother kept the picture on the top of her bureau , a black-and-white photo with scalloped edges . In the background was my grandfather 's shed , where he had a cot for naps on summer afternoons amidst the pleasant aroma of gasoline , turpentine , and sawdust . I would visit them on Saturday afternoons and sit in the backyard swing with my grandma while Grandpa push-mowed the yard in neat stripes , the blades snicking against the roller . Every now and then he 'd happen upon a long-forgotten Easter egg . A rainbow of egg shell would arc up from the mower while a pungent , sulfuric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-buried Easter egg . Alice Stout was my Sunday school teacher when I was growing up at Harmony Friends Meeting . When she would ask me why we celebrated Easter , I knew I was supposed to say something about Jesus rising from the tomb . But that struck me as a fanciful yarn the adults concocted to liven up the religion . For me , Easter was about sitting at the kitchen table with my mother and brother the night before , dipping eggs in teacups of dye , then laying them out to dry on that week 's copy of the Harmony Herald . Now Alice Stout is in the nursing home at Cartersburg , four eggs short of a dozen . When I went to visit her the week before Easter and read to her from the Scriptures about the Resurrection , she cackled like a madwoman . " Bullfeathers , " she said . It is troublesome to struggle all your life believing something , only to have your Sunday school teacher dismiss it as bullfeathers , even if she is out of her gourd .

I returned to my hometown and became the pastor of my childhood church.Now it 's my job to rally the troops and urge them to believe things they might otherwise doubt , at least according to Dale Hinshaw , our self-appointed guardian of doctrinal purity , who 's been vigilant about keeping me orthodox , lest I stray into the wilds of rationalism . On my fourth Easter as pastor , I suggested we hold special services during Holy Week . I 'm not sure now what possessed me to do that , probably my naive habit of thinking the church is always one program away from vitality . I envisioned a little Scripture reading , some singing , then a spirited theological discussion on certain aspects of the Resurrection . When I presented my idea to the elders , they waded in with their concerns . Asa Peacock wanted to know if we could have cookies . Dale Hinshaw made me promise we 'd read from the King James Version of the Bible . Harvey Muldock suggested holding a raffle each night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically , that if the kitchen were used , the Friendly Women 's Circle was not going to be stuck cleaning it . Even though I grew up in this church and am accustomed to its eccentricities , I continue to marvel at how the simplest idea can soon rival the complexity of a Middle East peace treaty . What began as a modest suggestion to read the Bible , pray , and reflect on the meaning of Easter soon involved three committees , a church-wide vote on cookie preference , and an agreement to collect a special offering for the Friendly Women 's Circle Cabinet Fund . Fern Hampton was placed in charge of the cookie vote . Miriam Hodge suggested she might not want to make a big deal about it , just take an informal poll among the ladies of the church . " What about the men ? " Harvey Muldock asked . " How come we do n't get any say ? " " I 'm sorry , Harvey , " Miriam said . " I did n't mean to exclude you . What kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my job to ask people what kind of cookies they wanted , " Fern complained . " By all means , " Miriam said . " I just thought I 'd help . " Fern turned to Harvey . " What kind of cookies would you like , Harvey ? " Harvey thought for a moment . " How about those little chocolate cookies with oatmeal that you mix up and put in the refrigerator ? " " One vote for chocolate drop cookies , " Fern said , rooting through her purse for paper and a pencil . " Dale , what kind of cookies would you like ? " " Fern , perhaps we could do this a bit later , " Miriam suggested . " I 'm sure Sam has more pressing business for us to discuss just now . " " Do n't I get to say what kind of cookies I like ? " Dale asked . " You go right ahead , Dale , " Fern said . " I 'm sure Sam wo n't mind . " " Well , I was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had these Scripture cookies . Kind of like fortune cookies , except they got the Word in ' em instead . I think we ought a get us some of them . " I used to believe the world would be saved by church committees , though sixteen years of ministry have cured me of such optimism . Now I prize those rare and selfless saints , those unwavering levers , who move the world while the committees are deciding on carpet colors . After Fern 's cookie survey , we moved on to the pressing matter of the special collection for the kitchen cabinets . " Sam , what are your thoughts on the ushering ? " Dale asked . " You want a box at the back of the meetinghouse for folks to put their donations in , or were you wantin ' the guys to pass the baskets ? " " Well , if you ask me , " Fern interrupted , " I think we should pass the baskets . That way people ca n't sneak out the side door without giving .
