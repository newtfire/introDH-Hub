Heeheeheehee ! " // Tenderfoot Scout Andy Mudd , 12 , reads the rest of the mess . Then he and six other members of Troop 124 , Carney , Md. , jump on bicycles and Mart pedaling across Ohiopyle State Park in Pennsylvania , chasing Malone . It 's a tough assignment . Malone and his band of thieves plan to steal a hidden reasure and blow up a dam . Only the Scouts of Troop 124 can stop him . Look Out for That Van ! Photograph // If this sounds dangerous , do n't worry . Foiling Malone 's plan and finding the treasure just added a unique twist to Troop 124 's summercamp outing last July . The stories were a way to add even more fun to usual Scout adventures . The Scouts have nothing to fear . There are no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " We were chasing them on bikes , and they were supposed to be running from us in a van , " Andy says . " And to my surprise someone came up in a van . I mean , we knew it was fake all the time , but there was still a possibility it might have been real . " Say ft Again : Be Prepared Troop 124 's weeklong adventure took place in the 1,700-foot-deep Youghiogheny ( YAW-ki-GAY-nee ) River Gorge . The troop divided into six patrols , with each day 's adventures tailored to the ages and abilities of the Scouts . Old- er boys tackled whitewater rating and longer backpack- ing trips . Younger Scouts tried whitewater canoeing and less-strenuous hikes . Chasing Malone was aimed at younger boys . But there was a mystery for the older Scouts too . Each night , Scouts received an envelope detailing the next day 's activities . Says 13-year-old Star Scout Patrick Seaby : " You did n't know what to expect next . You had to prepare for everything . " The Plot Thickens Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly Andy spotted a man apparently left for dead by the outlaws . As Andy pulled alongside the man and hit the brakes , the man-actually one of the troop 's adult leadersopened his eyes and said : " This is a station . Come on and help me . " That was another part of this weeklong test of leadership and outdoor skills . Activities were broken up with stations , where boys worked on merit badges such as First Aid .

" Our troop goes on trips at least once a month , " 15-year-old Star Scout Josh Cain says . " It really put us in a good mental state for taking on the challenges . " But you ca n't prepare for everything while chasing an outlaw gang-especially in a raft shooting Class III and IV rapids ( the highest is Class VI ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rapids would be the easiest part of the trip . " That 's when you think you can just sit there , " he says , " but actually that 's when you have to paddle the hardest . " Suddenly , a raft flipped , and 15-yearold Life Scout Darren Greene and others found themselves underneath the raft in bone-chilling water . Darren and the others knew what to do : Stay calm , keep their heads above water and float through the rapids with feet high and in front of them so they do n't get caught by submerged boulders or trees . Soon , the Scouts were out of the dangerous current , flipped the raft upright , grabbed their paddles and climbed in . After splashing through several more rapids , the Scouts hit land , hiked up a hill and climbed on their bikes for a 10-mile ride to their campsite . Mystery Sole But what about Griswold Malone ? Did he get away ? Of course not . He never existed .

" Yes , but what about that treasure ? Malone did n't find it , but the Scouts did . Says 12-year-old Tenderfoot Scout Michael Fine : " The treasure was the memory of this trip . " YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS .. In Troop 124 's Chasing Malone challenge , one big twist was that the Scouts never knew until the night before what the next day held , They had to be prepared for anything because their assignment could include cycling , whitewater rafting , even horseback riding .
