 Knives and spoons are placed at the right , the sharp edge of the knife toward the plate . Forks and napkins at the left . Be careful that all knives , forks and spoons are at least one inch from the edge ' of the table . Glasses at the top of the knives , three quarters full of water , and filled at the last moment . Salt and pepper on the table at every meal . Place the chairs at the table the last thing . This is the general plan of table setting . The arrangement thus far is the same for all meals . The addition of the proper articles for eating the different foods varies with the different meals . Any one who can set a table properly has done a good piece of work . It means training the eye to see with exactness , so that the least unevenness in the placing of any object will be noticed immediately , as well as the training of the memory to remember everything that should be on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must be carefully noticed . Every door and drawer should be tightly closed . If the meal is breakfast and the morning paper is delivered it should be placed neatly on a chair . No clothing about , or articles not pertaining to eating . Breakfast Table . A good breakfast for a family where there are children is fruit , coffee for the father and mother , milk or cocoa for the children , cereal with milk and sugar , toast and butter for all . If you use this as a practice breakfast , and take it for granted that there is no servant to wait , you must have everything needed on the table , excepting the hot food ( coffee , hot milk , cereal , toast ) . // In addition to the general plan there will be needed on this breakfast table : fruit plates , butter plates and butter knives , extra glasses for milk , coffee cups , two spoons at each plate , bread , butter , sugar , pitcher of milk , pitcher of water . When the fruit plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it should be placed before each person . Dinner Table . In preparing the table for dinner follow the general table-setting plan . Place as many forks , knives and spoons by the side of each plate as will be required during the meal . Place on the table ( if the meal is to be served by the family ) all food , except hot dishes . On a near-by side table have any extra plates or prepared cold dishes that will be needed after the first course . Have space on this side table for hot dishes . A shelf under the serving table on which to place soiled or emptied dishes , and castors to enable you to move the serving table from place to place , will be found a great convenience . Before considering the dinner table as finished , go over in your mind each article of food to be served and see if everything needed for that food is on the dinner table or the serving table ; take notice whether the arrangement of the table is attractive , and whether you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hot dishes . If one member of the family rises and serves the others , she should pass all dishes ( from which one helps oneself ) on the left hand side , holding the dish low for the convenience of the person served ; hold a napkin in the hand under the dish . Go on the right side if you are placing a plate on the table or taking a used plate from // the table . In the absence of a servant pass as many dishes as possible without rising . If the serving table is on castors , or if there is a removable tray the size of the serving table , all hot dishes , for each course , can be brought in at one time ; thus steps are saved and the social side of the meal is less disturbed . Luncheon and Supper Table . The table at these meals differs little from a breakfast table . After the general table-setting plan , acid such articles as will be needed during the meal . Just before serving dessert at any meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not be needed for the dessert ; brush the crumbs from the table with a clean napkin on to a plate . See that all glasses are refilled , and then bring in the dessert plates and the dessert . Servants . Many people have a paid employee or servant to do much or all of the housework . Some have one and some many of such employees . That does not mean that the work connected with homes are tasks for which any woman is too fine and so hires a person to do the work for her . It means ( or should mean ) that in many homes there are too many things for one woman to do , especially in homes where children are to be cared for . If the mother has money enough she hires some one to come in and do a part of the housework in order that she may be free to do more thoroughly such duties as she feels are her especial responsibility . It does not mean that one woman pays another woman to do her work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory or store carries on its // business in the same way . One man can not keep the books , run the errands , sell the goods , and attend the telephone ; so the manager divides up the work between himself and those whom he hires to help him . A man does not look down upon these associates in business ; he knows that they are exactly as good as he is and their work , like his , a necessary part of the whole business . A man who stands at the head of a business and directs others is perfectly fitted for his work only if he knows by practical experience every branch of the business . For this reason men who aim to be directors start at the bottom and work up . A homemaker must , in the same way , have had her experience in every branch of housekeeping before she can consider herself an efficient person to direct servants . A servant is less protected by law than any other business woman . Thirty-nine states have laws limiting the working hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women workers in hotels and restaurants included ; in only five are public institution servants protected ; and in no State are the servants in our homes protected by law . They are obliged to work as many hours as the head of the house directs , or give up the place . There is a great work for every woman and every girl to do in uplifting the profession of the house workers or servants . In the first place , have as exact a rule about the hours of work and the hours of freedom from work , as is the case with factory or office labor . This regulation of time will at once put the profession on a business basis . Do not ask any woman to perform for you any labor that hurts her dignity or any act that each individual should do for herself . Never address a servant with anger or as if she belonged to you . Show all // employees the same courtesy you expect from them . Remember that you make them just as angry as they make you ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant has her own way of doing things . She will do better work as you give her more freedom in her tasks . Never forget that one woman gets tired as surely as another , and one woman wants happiness as surely as another , and all people get lonely at tinges . If you take a human being into your home as a servant , only eight hours of her time should belong to you . Beyond this her time is her own to use as she desires . Expert Table Work . An expert in any kind of work will be careful of details . In table work the skilled laborer will be : Always clean and neatly dressed ; being particular about finger nails and hair . Will step lightly and quickly . Will close a door without noise . Will never rattle dishes or make any sound with the silver . Will never let her dress touch the dishes on the table . Will be pleasant about her work . A skilled laborer is not cross as he works . Dining-Room Rules . I. The dining-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . Have hot dishes for hot food , cold dishes for cold food . 3 . Glasses should not be filled until just before a meal is served . DINING-ROOM 45 , 4 . Butter must not be placed on the table until the meal is ready . 5 . Bread must be freshly cut . 6 . Everything placed before a person is placed at the right . All dishes from which a person serves himself are passed at the left . 7 . Everything relating to one course must be removed before serving another . 8 . A meal is not ready for the family until everything is in readiness in the dining-room and the kitchen is in order ; all pots and pans soaking , and a space cleared for the soiled dishes as they are removed from the dining-room after using . 9 . In clearing the table food must be removed first , then soiled china , glass and silver . Brush off the crumbs from the table and wipe the table with cloth slightly damp . Put away very carefully the doilies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doiley take it out at once ( see stains page cep ) . Put doilies that require laundering in the clothesbasket . Silver . The cleaning of silver is a part of dining-room work . To Clean Silver . Collect newspaper , old tray , silver polish , saucer , alcohol or water , duster and two pieces of old cloth . Method . Dust the silver , // Mix some silver polish and alcohol in a saucer . Rub this on each piece of silver and lay each aside on a piece of newspaper to dry . When thoroughly dry , polish off with another cloth . A soft brush is necessary to remove the polish from grooves or designs . Wash the silver in hot water before returning it to the drawer . Table Etiquette . The attitude of one member of a family at a meal . can make or spoil that meal for the entire family . Each member of the family should cultivate a habit of appreciation ; that is , do n't be fault finding but take the food that is on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys who always come to the table in a faultfinding mood , they seem to take pleasure in saying that they " hate " this or that dish . forgetting that some one has worked hard to prepare it . A bad temper or an unhappy mood while eating is not good for the stomach and often produces indigestion . Talking pleasantly and eating slowly while at meals aids digestion . When a meal is ready , go at once to the table . If late , the food gets cold and you have spoiled the pleasure of the cook , as well as annoyed the family , and ruined the taste of your own meal . A meal is a family gathering . No one must think of herself alone , but of what will give the entire group the most pleasure . We should not be over-anxious as to what is on our plate . Let us keep our eyes open . Notice when some one wants his plate replenished or his water glass refilled , or is in need of butter , salt , pepper , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait on her ; she is the one to // rise when necessary and wait on those older than herself . " See to it that a certain ceremony , a certain importance , be attached to the partaking of food . " BOOKER T. WASHINGTON . CHAPTER IV LIVING-ROOM An English architect describes the living-room as " a room with space enough to carry on the business of life freely and with pleasure , and with furniture made for use . " Another describes the living-room as a room that grows until it expresses the individual tastes of each member of the family . " I give a loving glance as I go To three brass pots on a shelf in a row To my Grandfather 's grandfather 's loving cup And a bandy-leg chair I once picked up And I ca n't for the life of me make you see Why just these things are a part of me . " This does not sound like the old-fashioned back and front parlor used only on state occasions , with the shades drawn to save the carpet from fading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , it has ceased to be needed in the homes of to-day . The right kind of a living-room will suggest to you at once what occupations the family are engaged in . Do they read good hooks ? If so , the book shelves and the library table will tell you so . There will be lights low enough to read by , and these will be placed near the comfortable chairs . Is the family musical ? You will be able to tell this not only by a piano or other musical instrument , but by the sheets of music which you will find in the music rack . They will be the compositions of real 48 // musicians and jolly refined tunes , not the cheap , vulgar songs of the day . Are there stay-at-home , domestic members in the family ? If so , the work basket will have a place in the living-room , and there will be a good light on the table to sew by . Desk . In this living-room there must be a desk for writing . If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a drawer and with square , not turned , legs . Make an alcohol stain the color you require . Stain the entire table and after it is thoroughly dry , rub off any powder that may be left on the surface of the desk with a soft cloth , and then wax every part with a good floor wax or common beeswax . For the back of the desk make a rack like the picture to hold bills , papers , etc . ( Any carpenter can make this rack , or a smart boy can make it ) . Have a glass or brass tray to hold pens and pencils , a glass inkwell and a large blotter . Glass fittings for the desk save time as they need only to be washed , and not // polished . The blotter should be of a color that blends with the room , and there always should be small blotters near at hand so as to keep the large blotter fresh and clean . Library Table . There should be a large table in the living-room , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Have one made of good wood , oiled or waxed rather than polished , because a polished table soon becomes marred . A table cloth on this table catches the dust and makes extra labor for the housekeeper . Therefore , an uncovered table is to be preferred ; or a table covered with chintz which has over it a glass surface . The chintz adds color to the room and the glass is easily washed . Tea Table . Afternoon tea is often served in the living-room , and as it is inconvenient to clear away the books , work basket , etc. from the large table , a small folding table should be on hand to be brought out at tea time . The tea tray , with every furnishing for tea on it , will be prepared in the kitchen and brought into the living-room and placed on this small table . Fireplace . If there is but one fireplace in the house have it in the living-room , then build your room around it ; that is , think of the open fire as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in relation to it . Pictures . If you have just a few good pictures hang these in the living-room , as the room suggests more leisure to look at pictures than any other room in the house . // Care of Living Room . The daily and weekly cleaning of this room does not differ from the sweeping and dusting of dining-room or bedroom . Books . Books are hard to keep clew if not kept behind glass doors . In dusting books never use duster dampened with water . If leather bindings of books are wiped with a cloth slightly dampened with castor oil once a year they will be much longer preserved . Desk . Every day dust the desk . Throw away blotters when used up . Refill inkwell when necessary . Be careful of letters and papers belonging to other people . Never read one word of the papers and letters on other people 's desks . Leave all papers in neat piles . Lamps . In a living-room or library that has no electric lights , a kerosene lamp is almost a necessity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are absolutely dependent upon kerosene and candles . Therefore it is well for every girl to know about the care of lamps whether she uses them at the present time or not . Daily Cleaning of Lamps . Two lamp cloths , hot water , and a duster are needed . First dust the chimney , shade , and body of the lamp . Wash the chimney as you would any other glassware . If sooty clean with paper before washing . Next , turn the wick high enough to show all the charred part . Wipe this off with tissue paper until wick is perfectly even . // It is well to light it in order to test the evenness . Fill lamp , and then with lamp cloth wipe off any oil that may be on the outside . Dry with second cloth . A bright light comes from clean burners . When lighting the lamp turn the wick down , allowing the chimney to become heated slowly . Put new chimneys in cold water and allow the water slowly to come to a boil . This will prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp is first lighted . In putting the lamp out , blow across the chimney ? never into it ? as this might send the flame down into the kerosene . If it is necessary to move a lighted lamp , first turn the wick low . The flaring up of the flame smokes the chimney . Thorough Cleaning of Lamps . This need not be done oftener than two or three times a year if lamps have daily care . For this cleaning take a tray , a newspaper , a duster , two cloths , a dish towel , scissors , soft paper , kerosene , and a pan of hot soda water . Cover the tray with newspaper . Place the lamp on the tray and take it apart . First wash the chimney and shade in hot water and dry with a towel ; polish , using soft paper if there is no chamois . Boil every part of the burner in the hot soda-water . Fill the reservoir with kerosene within an inch of the top . Trim , but never wash , the wicks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with oil . Put all parts of the burner and lamp together ; wipe every part clean , seeing that all is tight , that the wick is even , and the chimney is clear . Put the cloths to soak . Later wash and boil them . // Keep an old pan exclusively for cleaning lamps , for the odor of the kerosene is lasting and would ruin pans for other use . Remember that special care must be taken when kerosene is used . A drop on the kitchen table or the hands may spoil a ' whole dinner . CHAPTER V BEDROOMS The living-room , dining-room , and kitchen in your house belong to all , but each bedroom is the expression of only one or two people . These rooms , therefore , should be as individual as the members of the family , each room expressing a personality . Furnishing the Bedrooms . Do not have plumbing of any kind in the rooms that are used for sleeping . Confine the plumbing to the bathrooms , pantry , kitchen , and laundry ; thus the piping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . There is also less danger of sewer gas in the house . The possibility of sewer gas in a sleeping room is too great a danger , and for this reason washstands with running water are no longer placed in bedrooms . No Ornaments . A bedroom needs no ornaments except a few good pictures , and the usual bedroom necessities which should be beautiful as well as useful . No Fancy Beds . Queens used to hold receptions in bed . For this reason lavishly decorated beds came into existence , but now beds are used only to sleep in at night and but three things should be considered : Is the bed comfortable , can every part of it be washed and are the lines good ? S4 // Do not place your bed in the corner of the room where there is no circulation of air . Corner air is apt to be stale . Another Do n't . You will not sleep any better by surrounding your bed with a handsome set of furniture . Buy what you need in the way of a bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because it Ms the room and your special taste . If an adjoining large and small room are used jointly for a bedroom and a dressing room , it is sometimes better to use the small room to sleep in and the large one as a dressing and living-room . The bedroom can then be kept as cold as a sleeping porch , and the larger warm room used to dress in . Beds . Have iron or brass beds . Wooden beds are hard to keep clean and attract insects . The day of the double bed is past , because single beds are more easily made and kept clean , and it is healthier and more comfortable for each person to have a bed of his own . Trundle Bed . A trundle bed is a bed which can be pushed under another bed in the daytime . This is a great convenience in crowded quarters . If you wish to have a trundle bed . attach four short legs to a bed spring , and it is made . Or take a regular couch bed and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the best , but are the most expensive . Cotton and hair mattresses are less expensive // and very comfortable . Excelsior mattresses are hard , but cheap , and when covered by a cotton pad are not uncomfortable . Feather mattresses are unsanitary , they over-heat the body , and the body can not lie in a flat , healthy position . Screen . A screen is necessary in the bedroom for privacy , if more than one person occupies the room . This may be made of a clothes-horse hung with burlap or cretonne or any wash material . Paint the screen white or any color that blends with the room . Use brass tacks in the top of the screen as knobs ; on these hang the curtain by brass rings sewed to it . This curtain is easy to take off and clean and is better than a gathered curtain tacked fast . Bureaus . See that all bureaus have drawers that open and shut easily ; that the handles are wooden or heavy brass , not light , cheap brass handles ; that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bureau are simple and the finish ( lull . A high polish is used only on very cheap or very expensive furniture . It is poor taste to imitate the latter . The high polish can be removed from a cheap bureau and the bureau waxed . If light handles are changed for plain , heavy brass ones , the whole bureau will have a more pleasing appearance . Cl3sets . If closets are not built in the house , a place must be made in which to hang clothes . Have a shelf in each bedroom . On this shelf tack a curtain . A clothes-tree in the room for wrapper , night gown , or any article just taken off , will keep one from // throwing clothes on chairs . A window-seat with a closet underneath is a convenience in a bedroom for boots and shoes . Child 's Room . Do not furnish the children 's room with any old pieces of furniture or ugly rugs , taking it for granted that a child is too young to care . The children 's room should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child . There is an educational advantage in the coloring of the room if this coloring is beautiful and the colors well combined ; in the lines of the furniture , if they are simple ; and in the pictures on the wall if they are worth looking at and are the kind of pictures that a child can understand . These pictures should be hung low so that the child can see them easily . The shelf for books should be low enough for the child to reach the books . This should be true , also , of the shelf or box for toys . Have nothing in the room that is very valuable , because a child is not capable of knowing the value of things , or of being responsible for things that he can handle . We all know this , and yet we scold a young child if he breaks what we prize . If the child 's bedroom is to give pleasure to the child , the pictures , wall paper , curtains , bed covering ? all must be of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be to the child his very own , he must be allowed to " muss it up " at times , because that is his nature and his baby way of expressing his energy . He can be taught to put away his own toys after he has finished playing with them . Nursery pictures can be pasted on the wall and washed over with white liquid shellac : then they may be washed with the walls , if the walls are painted . // Guest Bedroom . A guest room must suggest welcome . It must not only be comfortable but must show that the homemaker has given her own thought to it and not left it entirely to servants . In every guest room have a basket or box of sewing materials , hairpins , pins , paper , envelopes , good pens and ink , such books as the different guests would be likely to want to read , and drinking water . At night a few crackers in the room are often appreciated . While a member of the family will always feel free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather go without than trouble the hostess . A few fresh flowers in the bedroom are not a necessity , but they will be a proof to a guest that she is welcome to the home . Do not have articles about the guest room that are distinctly personal to the family , such as family portraits on the bureau , the closet half filled with clothes , the desk cluttered with family letters . This will make a guest conscious that you have turned someone out in order to make room for her . Hospitality is more often a characteristic of simple people who have not much money than of rich people who live in an elaborate way . Hospitality quite often decreases rather than increases as people become what we call civilized , although civilization means to grow more refined and more enlightened . In Tahiti , in the Society Islands in the Pacific Ocean , the natives greet a stranger by saying " Iorana , " which means " Come in and have something to eat . " In Mexico , long ago , a stranger who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a room for the night and food . On the table in these guest rooms it was the custom to have a pile of silver known as " guest money . " From this the stranger // took what he needed to continue his journey to the next stopping place . Formality is not politeness , but it often happens as a people grow rich and get the gloss of social ways , that they mistake forms for real courtesies . As long as people live simply there is time and desire to entertain guests . It is when our lives get crowded and confused that we find it hard to be interrupted by our friends . Bedroom Work . Airing the Bed . Every morning the moment you are out of bed take all the bedding off , throw it over chairs , raise the mattress in the middle so that the air can reach it on all sides , open the windows top and bottom , and allow all bedding to air for at least half an hour . In the average home where the housework is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being prepared and eaten . Daily Work . This is the work that someone in every household has to do every day . Not only does the bed have to be aired and made , but the bedroom has to be put in order and left free from dust and made attractive . Just as surely as every morning you wash your body , face , and hands , comb and arrange your hair and your dress , so do you make your bedroom fresh , clean , and attractive . These daily household tasks are often dull and monotonous , but if we do them well they become an art and a means to an end . That end is an orderly habit of mind with which to gain greater control over the larger happenings of life . A mind grows orderly in sympathetic surroundings . 6o THE HOME AND ITS MANAGEMENT A bedroom , in a way , represents the girl or woman who occupies it and cares for it . If it has an atmosphere of order and simplicity and repose , it is beautiful and tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused by them . If the room smells of sweet , outdoor air , we know it is the habit of the occupant to push the hot air out by letting in fresh air . If there are no unnecessary things about , we know at once that the girl who sleeps in the room has good taste , which comes largely through education . Every one has seen a bedroom so full of charm that she longs to know the person who is responsible for it . Before making the bed , the room must be " picked up " ; that is , each article out of place must be put back into its own place . Soiled clothing must be put into the soiled clothes basket or barrel ; coats , dresses , or hats not in use hung up ; books put back in the bookcase . Bedroom Closets . Never hang up in the closet any article of clothing which has been worn without first shaking and airing it . At night , when the window is open , or in the morning when the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closet and let the cold outdoor air blow through the clothes . Every one has noticed the close odor that sometimes comes out when the door of a bedroom closet is opened . This odor is unnecessary if the dust is brushed out of our outer garments each day , the clothes shaken and aired before hanging in the closet , and the closet and clothes aired at night . Bedmaking . The following is the usual way to make a bed , but BEDROOMS 6i exact methods vary with different teachers and different housekeepers . It is well for children to learn these tasks exactly , by one rule . Only after much education should one try individual methods . First . Turn the mattress from end to end . Be sure the mattress is the other side up from what it was the night before and the other end around . Thus the mattress wears longer and does not become worn down in one place . Second . Place a pad or square of cotton flannel over the mattress , before putting on the lower sheet . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable . Third . Put lower sheet right side up , broad hem at the top , tuck in first at top , then at bottom , stretching very tight before tucking in the sides . Make square corners . Fourth . Have second sheet wrong side up , broad hem at the top . At first , tuck in only at bottom . Be sure that both sheets have middle crease exactly in the middle of the bed . Fifth . Put the blanket on the bed at least a quarter of a yard below the top of second sheet , and turn top sheet over blanket to keep blanket clean . Now tuck in the sides , top sheet and blanket together . Both sheets and blankets should be tucked in with square corners , and pulled so tight that there is no crease anywhere . Sixth . The spread is put on over the blanket , also with square corners , but the sides of the spread should not he tucked in but allowed to hang , in order to hide the sides of the bed . Seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can entirely spoil the looks of the bed , but if the pillow is very clean // and very smooth and lies very square on the bed it will add to its beauty . Eighth . When a comforter is used it is better to roll the comforter and put it at the foot of the bed than to make up the bed with the comforter under the spread , because the bed must be kept square like a box , and this is not possible when made up with a puff . Cleaning the Bed . In a crowded city , especially in old houses and in apartment houses , no house can be sure of always being kept free from bedbugs . They are one of the evils of congestion . They appear under conditions of dirt and neglect , but they are easily transferred from dirty homes to clean homes . Thus watchfulness and care are necessary even on the part of a perfect housekeeper . If bedbugs get into a bed , first clean the mattress with a carbolic acid solution and put the mattress aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry thoroughly , and then wash with a solution of carbolic acid or a bedbug preparation which can be bought at any drug store . Repeat this every day until all traces of bugs are gone . Bedbugs hide chiefly in cracks , in the Castors of beds , and in the tufting of the mattress . They always stay in dark places . If they continue after the bed is clean , they are usually to be found behind the base board or wall paper . Preventive Work . If a housekeeper , even in a tenement house , is on the watch she will never let this evil get the better of her . As a preventive against bedbugs , clean well once a month . Take all clothes from the bed and shake hard in the air , // throwing them loosely over a chair near the window . Wipe the mattress first with a cloth wrung out in water and Sulpho-Naphthol , being especially careful to wipe in the tufted places . After making sure that the mattress is clean from all dust , put near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed and the springs of the bed , first with soap and water , then with clear kerosene . Be sure that the springs are perfectly dry before making up the bed . If one moves into a dirty apartment in which bedbugs are in the woodwork or wall paper , have all wall paper taken off and the walls scrubbed with hot water , Gold Dust or strong soap and Sulpho-Naphthol . Pour a carbolic acid solution behind the baseboards and wash the closets with Sulpho-Naphthol , Gold Dust , and hot water . If , after this thorough scouring , the entire place is painted , no further trouble should occur . A more thorough cure is to close tight all doors and windows , paste paper over cracks that let in air , then burn candles of sulphur or corrosive sublimate in this empty air-tight room for twenty-four hours . This should be done before the painting if there is any doubt of cleanliness . Sweeping . After the bed is made each morning sweep the floor . In sweeping use different sides and corners of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold the broom near the floor and sweep with short strokes so that the dust will not fly about . Before sweeping any room see that no uncovered food is in the room , or anything that dust would injure . Sweep out the corners of the room first ( a small brush for this is best ) . Sweep toward the center of the room . // Use a dust pan and brush to gather up the dirt that you have swept into the middle of the room . If you have a coal stove it is better to burn this dust at once as it may contain disease germs . If you have a gas stove put the dust in a paper and send it out with the ashes . Brush out the large broom , after using , with the small brush . Wipe the dust pan with a cloth . Wipe off the small brush with the same cloth . Shake out the cloth and put it at one side to be washed . Dusting . In ( lusting use cheesecloth dusters because cheesecloth is soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it only scatters the dust . With a dry duster wipe off the windows , mirrors , brass , china , and books . Then shake the dust from the cloth and after dampening it wipe all articles not marred by dampness , dusting at the same time the shelf or table on which they stand . Woodwork should be wiped off with a damp cloth ; this includes chairs , tables , desks , and any wood that is painted , varnished , or stained but not polished . For highly polished wood use an oily woolen cloth , as a cloth damp with water leaves streaks . Boilod linseed oil , with or without beeswax mixed with it , is used for polishing . Weekly Bedroom Cleaning . As in the kitchen , so in all rooms , the closets must be cleaned first if they are to be cleaned on the same day as the room . Once a month is often enough to give bedroom closets a thorough cleaning . Thorough Cleaning of Closets . When you clean a closet thoroughly , take all clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it // is taken out . Air these clothes in the open air , if possible , while the closet is being cleaned . Brush all loose dust and dirt from the walls and floor of the closet , wipe the walls with a damp cloth and scrub the floor , being careful to wipe out all cracks and crevices . Dry and then shut the door tight before beginning the cleaning of the room . Besides each day dusting and doing the regular morning work in a bedroom , it is necessary once a week to give the room a thorough cleaning . Dust all movable things , including small pictures , and put them in another room . Take curtains down if possible ; if not , pin them up away from the floor . Cover with old sheetr , kept for the purpose any stuffed piece of furniture too heavy to move from the room . Take out any rugs that may be on the floor , and then sweep the floor with windows open . Brush the walls with a covered broom , then sweep again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust is settling , wash the windows . Wash the mirrors at the same time as the windows , also wash the glass of all pictures which have not been removed from the room . ( For washing windows , see page 34 . ) Next clean the woodwork , washing the painted woodwork if it is really dirty , and wiping it with clean damp cloth if not . To Wash Painted Woodwork . First . Wipe with damp cloth . Second . Wash with white soap or whiting and warm water . Third . Wipe off soap with clear cool water . If there is a stained or waxed floor , oil or wax it the // fast thing before moving the small pieces of furniture back into the room . Do not forget to dust the gas fixtures . Never try to clean them with polish . Rubbing the gas fixture hard will loosen it . If curtains have been taken down , shake them well , out of doors if possible , before rehanging them . To Clean Brass . All brass and nickel should be cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a regular day for polishing all the brass , silver , and nickel in the house , not a general cleaning day . ) Dampness tarnishes brass and nickel . If copper is too tarnished to clean with brass polish , first boil in soda and water . It will then polish easily . For cleaning brass it is necessary to use some substance to remove the dirt , tarnish , and corrosion , and also a dry polish to give a higher luster . First , collect the necessary implements : A newspaper to protect the table . An old tray upon which to set the article to be cleaned . Wet polish , or brass paste . Dry powder ( whiting or silver powder is good ) . A cheesecloth for dusting . Three pieces of cloth ( that you can throw away ) . A polish cloth ( tissue paper , or newspaper , may be substituted for this cloth ) . Never use good cloths of any kind for hard cleaning . It wears them full of holes . Dust the brass , apply wet polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This cloth becomes very dirty and should be thrown away . // Use a piece of match-stick under cloth to remove dirt from cracks and grooves . Wipe off the wet polish , which loosens the dirt and rub with a second piece of cloth . With a third , apply the dry white polish . Rub hard with polishing-cloth . Brass will keep bright twice as long if treated with a final dry white polish . To keep brass from tarnishing when not in use , wrap in tissue paper . To Clean Nickel . Wipe off nickel . Mid silver polish with a little water or alcohol . Rub this on each piece of nickel . When dry , wipe off powder and polish with a clean , dry cloth . After the bedroom has been cleaned , see that it looks orderly . A room may be clean and yet not attractive . The shades must be even , the chairs straight , plants watered , and all dead leaves taken off . CHAPTER VI PLUMBING Odors . Odors are danger signals . A had odor means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you smell gas , look at once for the leak . Fumes of gas cause death . Do not look for the leak with a light . If you smell that dry , disagreeable odor which is associated with the burning of agate or tinware , you should rush to fill the kettle or saucepan . The water is boiled away ; the smell is the warning which comes often too late to save the kettle . Every one has noticed a stale smell when entering a bedroom where the windows have been closed all night . This is a warning that the oxygen in the air has been exhausted and only poisoned air is left . 1-lad one window been open at the top and bottom , no odor would have been in the room . Oxygen , or fresh air , has no odor . At times the offensive breath of a friend has been noticeable . There are days when qne is conscious that one 's own breath is not sweet . This is nature 's danger signal . The breath is virtually without odor in health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a person 's life that produces an unhealthy condition of which the bad breath is but the sign . Eating candy between meals , or eating too fast while at meals , or forgetting to drink water , creates indigestion . A coated tongue , a bad taste 68 // in the mouth ; these can be hidden from others . But nature uses still another method : she attacks our pride in her effort to make us obey her laws . The breath that comes from a disordered stomach no one can hide from others . Or , possibly the trouble is that the waste matter from the system has not been carried off . One 's obligation to reach school , store , or office at a certain hour is put ahead of every other duty . But nature rebels when her rules are broken . The waste matter of the body is poison to the system and the system must be cleansed of that waste every morning . The habit of neglecting this duty causes constipation . Constipation is first a clogged system , then a poisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means disease . Brushing the teeth night and morning , and a visit to the dentist , surely as often as once a year , will often prevent decay ; and without decay there can be no odor from the teeth . The close odor that is sometimes called the human odor is very noticeable in crowded places like trolley cars or a great city 's subway in the rush hours . And it is at times associated with an individual . This odor is like a loud voice crying , " The body has not been bathed recently . " " The clothes have not been changed often enough , " or " The clothes and the closet in which the clothes have hung have not been aired . " If human beings lived out of doors instead of in houses the air would cleanse the body from much of the impurity . Without this outdoor life , daily thought must be given to bathing the body and airing the clothes . It would be interesting , while on this subject , for pupils to think of other odors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . There is almost always a // remedy . In the case of the smell of smoke , immediate action and a cool head are what is needed . Sewer gas often has no odor , and so a test of plumbing is made with a liquid that has a strong smell like peppermint . This peppermint is put down the pipes , and if there is a leak the peppermint escapes and sends its odor up into the house , we know the sewer gas is escaping too . Under these circumstances , call in a plumber at once . The plumbing in our homes is connected with the sewerage system of the city , just as the disposition of all the individual left-over food and rubbish in each home is a part of the work of the great municipal department that cares for the street and city waste . Municipal Housekeeping . We have city or municipal housekeeping as well as personal housekeeping . Just as the work in a large hotel is divided into departments , the cooks being responsible for the kitchen work , the chambermaids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the work of a city is divided into departments , and each individual in each home is protected by the laws of these various departments . The police department is responsible for the order of the city . It is its duty to see that no man is disorderly on the street or in any way interferes with the rights of any other man . The street cleaning department is held responsible for the cleanliness of the streets , The work of the health department is to look after the physical condition of the city so that the people will not get sick ; and should a case of contagious sickness occur , to prevent its spread . And so we might talk of the department of bridges , public charities , department of correction , city courts , department of docks and ferries , fire department , // bureau of highways , park department , department of sew-ers and water supply . These are all branches of the city 's housekeeping , and the people of each city are taxed to pay the expenses of these departments . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of these departments is responsible . It is our money that pays for these city employees , and it is our business to see that these servants do their work well . The city departments that have to do with the plumbing in our homes are the health department and the tene-ment house or building department . In some cities all of this responsibility is thrown on the health department . PLUMBING Plumbing is anything connected with piping ? such as sinks , wash-tubs , bath-tubs and water-closets . Laws in regard to the construction of the plumbing are sometimes state laws , and sometimes city ordinances ; but each city 's health department must see that the piping of its houses is kept in good condition so as not to endanger the health of any citizen . It is the duty of every citizen not only to know the laws but to have a clear idea as to where the tenant 's responsi-bility lies and what is the responsibility of the owner of the house , so that he can go about the righting of wrongs intelligently . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate water-closet in a separate compartment located within each apartment , suite , or group of rooms . " " There shall be a sink or wash-bowl with running water in each apartment , suite , or group cf rooms . " // " In every tenement house all plumbing pipes shall be exposed . " That is , there can be no woodwork or even a curtain to hide the pipes . Each woman must be able to clean around her pipes and a leak can be noticed and mended at once . // " The floor , or other surface , beneath and around the water-closet and sinks shall be maintained in good order and repair , and if of wood shall be kept well painted with light-colored paint . " Many of these laws were made after houses were built , but owners of old houses must take away the old woodwork around the pipes and paint the floor a light color on which dirt can be seen easily . These laws are useless unless known and cooperated in by the owner of the house and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessary part of homemaking education . Every housekeeper should understand the piping in her house , how the water and waste liquid matter are carried from the house to the sewer . She should see to it that the light of day shines on every part of the piping . A trap , or water-seal , is a U-shaped bend in a pipe . It must always have in it sufficient clean water to extend an inch or more above the bend . This water is called the seal , and its use is to keep the sewer gas from coming into the room . All water-closets , sinks , and tubs have these water-seals . Buy a bent glass tube at any drug-store . Pour into this glass tube dirty water and then pour in clean water , and you will see how the clean water forces the unclean water down and forms the clean seal which keeps the odors from coming up . The stationary equipment connected with the plumbing in most homes is the water-closet , bathtub , wash-tubs and kitchen sinks , and some times stationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with plumbing , for , although the pipe in connection with the ice-box is not always built into the house , it is a pipe which must be cleaned in the same way as all other pipes , and it is a danger to health if not kept absolutely clean . // Kitchen Sink . First consider the kitchen sink and how to keep it clean , and how the pipe under it can be kept free from grease . This sink has the U-shaped pipe underneath , and , as has been learned from the reading of the plumbing laws , there is no woodwork inclosing this pipe . In a dark , damp place vermin collects , while in a light , dry place , where there is open plumbing , there is not this danger . The kitchen sink and the inside of the pipe connecting the sink with the sewer are kept free from the accumulations of grease by the use of soda . Dishwater is apt to be greasy , even if one is particular in the scraping of dishes . Liquid grease chiNs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipes ; other substances stick to these greasy sides ; and if nothing is done to cut away the grease , these substances rot and send odors into the house . The next thing is that the pipe becomes clogged and the water will not pass through . To correct this is not the plumber 's or the landlord 's business , but it is the duty of the little housekeeper , or the grown-up housekeeper , who washes the dishes . To Clear Pipes of Grease . A strong hot solution of washing soda will dissolve grease if there is no other foreign matter . The kitchen sink should be washed out with this hot solution of soda once a day ( as we learned in the kitchen work , page 27 ) . Further Pipe Cleaning . If the water still fails to flow freely , the trouble prob-ably is that a match , leaves , pieces of food , or like waste , has reached the bend or water-seal and can not pass through . Put a bucket underneath the bend . Unscrew the nut with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water collected in the bend will at once rush out bringing with it grease , tea leaves , coffee grounds , etc . This may cleanse the pipe ; if not , while nut is off , pour through the pipe a strong solution of soda and boiling water . A steel wire closely coiled ( called a ferret ) can be bought and used . Push this through the pipe if still not clear . Water-Closet . Water-closets should be well-lighted and well-ventilated and should have floors that wash . Every girl studying this chapter should know by heart the laws of her state relating to water-closets . Every one using a toilet should feel responsible for the condition of that toilet . Each time the water-closet is used it must be thoroughly flushed , at least three or four gallons of water should go down the pipe . The watercloset may be cleaned thoroughly every morning , but in one hour it can become an unattractive , unhealthy place if each person using it is not careful to flush it well , leaving the seat dry and clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet in every house , in every public hall , or in every public school , is the responsibility of every one who uses it . To Clean Water-Closet . For cleaning water-closet ( which should be done at least once a week ) you will need a long-handled brush , which is used only for the toilet : a cleaning cloth marked " T , " so that no one in the house will be tempted to use it for any other purpose ; hot , soapy water , and a kettleful of boiling hot soda solution . First lift the open , as well as the closed cover ; then with the hot soapsuds and the long-handled brush wash // every part of the bowl and all the hidden cracks and crevices . Flush thoroughly so that at least two or three gallons of water may flow into the pipes . Now , pour into the bowl the soda-solution , allowing it to run down the pipes as slowly as possible . Flush again thoroughly , and with the cloth wipe every part of the woodwork connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crevices , for it is in these damp hidden places the roaches collect , and from these places , if left damp , disagreeable odors come . This thorough cleaning of the toilet should be repeated at least once a week , besides the daily cleaning with the long-handled brush . Wash-Tubs . Wash-tubs are to be used only for washing clothes not for storing soiled clothes . It is very hard to keep wash-tubs absolutely free from dampness ; and allowing clothes to stay in a clamp , air-tight place will surely cause them to become ' moldy . There is nothing dirtier , more unhealthy , or more untidy than using wash-tubs as store places . To Clean Wash-Tubs . After using the tubs to wash clothes in , wash them thoroughly with soap and water , then wipe them out with a clean cloth . Be very careful to dry every part about the hinges of the cover of the tubs and all cracks and crevices . It is in these cracks that dampness collects and that cockroaches breed . After the tubs have been washed and dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to wash more clothes . // Bath-tubs . In England there is what is called the " Order of the Bath . " Back in the fourteenth century , when a king wanted to honor a nobleman he treated him to a bath as symbolic of regeneration ; a bath was rare in those days , as private baths were found only in palaces . After this honor , the Order of the Bath was conferred upon the nobleman . In these days there are few houses that have not one bathroom , and some houses have as many bathrooms as there are bedrooms . Furnishing . Have as little wood about your bathroom as possible . Remember that wood absorbs odors . If you can choose , have the tub some distance away from the wall . It is easier to clean behind it . Have as much white as possible in the bathroom ; it suggests cleanliness . If the room is papered , shellac the paper about the washstand where water is apt to spatter . Have a nickel basket for soiled towels ; a wet towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will mildew the other clothes . If a half curtain ( muslin ) at the window is necessary for protection , have two pair of such curtains so that when one is being washed a clean pair can he put up at once . The furnishing of a bathroom must be most carefully considered because of its connection with health . It must have floor and walls that can be scrubbed . The plumbing must be open , so that cleaning under the sink , bath-tub and toilet will be possible . There should be as few things in a bathroom as possible . A shelf or a closet for medicines , towel rack , a shelf for extra clean towels , hooks for tooth brushes , a toilet-paper rack or nail ( always supplied with toiletpaper ) , a few white hooks on the door or wall on which to // hang a wrapper or night-gown while bathing . Glass shelves and glass rollers are the best because easily washed . Bath-Tubs . Scrub out the bath-tub with soap and water every morn-ing ( not with sand soaps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each member of the family after bath-ing shall wipe out the bath-tub , and in addition the tub must be thoroughly scrubbed by the housekeeper as a part of the morning work . A tin tub can be brightened with Bon Ami powder . The stains on a porcelain or tin tub can be removed with turpentine , or kerosene . These stains come from soap , hard water , and the oil from our bodies . Bath tubs should be cleaned with kerosene at least once a week , and after that thoroughly scrubbed with soap and hot soda water . Nickel Faucets . If the nickel fittings in the sink and bath-tub are rubbed every day with a soft dry cloth they will not need to be cleaned with whitening oftener than once a week . Clean nickel like silver , page 45 . CHAPTER VII USEFUL FACTS FOR THE HOMEMAKER Furnishing . Let the colors of the different rooms blend . Sharp contrasts are neither pleasing nor artistic . Plan all rooms at the same time , having a general scheme of color , as one room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary and commonplace furnishings . This always shows thought . Furnishing can not be done in a clay , it should be a slow process . Often you can not tell what to buy to complete a room until you have lived in the room for a time . Remember that the people in the house are judged more or less by the house . If the furniture is tawdry , the ornaments sham , the pictures cheap and with showy frames , every one is sure to think that there is something a little vulgar in the minds of the people living in that house . Refinement is expressed by simplicity . Pictures . No pictures at all are better than poor ones . There are people who hang a picture because they happen to have it , irrespective of whether or not it gives pleasure . Such indifference cheapens a room . A picture is like a hook ; often you like it at first , but time proves that it does n't continue to please . If so take it down , you want your room to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scrap baskets can contribute a cer-tain beauty to the room in line and color . This does not mean they must be expensive . Often market baskets are charming in line . Do n't decorate a scrap basket with bows . If there is a carpenter in the family he can make a scrap basket out of wood . A bottom and four sides , with eight holes bored in each and the sides then held together by pieces of leather fastened through the holes , will make a basket . Ornaments . There are few ornaments so beautiful that they add to a room without the additional virtue of being useful as well . A vase has its place , it holds flowers ; candlesticks are necessary for the candles ; photograph frames only are good if they hold photographs you care for ? the frame is to show the photograph , the photograph is not an excuse to show off the frame . Pieces of copper and brass need not be useful to de-serve a place in the house . They add to a room by the very beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color and line is beautiful . But be sure it has this value . Shelves . Have all the shelves you can use . They save closet-room , table space , and floor space . They make it much easier to be orderly , and they really add ( if put up with thought ) to the lines of a room . Any one of the family with a knack for carpentry work can make and put up shelves . FACTS FOR THE HOMEMAKER 8i Kitchen Shelves . In the kitchen have a shelf under which you can hang brooms , brushes , dust pan , etc. , and on this shelf put jugs , jars , small brushes , or any kitchen utensils . Also , have a shelf for pots and pans ; one for stove materials near the stove ; and one near the sink for soap , soda , etc . Have shelves in the living-room for books ; in the dining-room for china ; in the bedroom for clothes , if there is no closet . No one can be orderly unless there is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the floors in a house is always a question . Carpets can not be kept sanitary unless they are cleaned with a vacuum cleaner , and few have this luxury . This is true of rugs when they are too large to be taken into the yard and cleaned . A few rugs , small enough to shake easily , are all right and practical . Many rugs are a nuisance . A painted floor is not durable unless you varnish over the paint . This varnish can be renewed from time to time and the paint kept from wearing off in spots . Shellac on floors is serviceable only when covered with wax , for shellac turns white if washed or even wiped with a damp floor cloth . The most satisfactory floor is a stained floor waxed with some good floor wax . Linoleum can be preserved by a coating of varnish . To Stain Floor . Only natural wood , without paint or varnish , can be stained . The wood should be well cleaned and thoroughly dried before staining . Soda and hot water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been painted remove the paint with lye and hot water , or varnish re82 THE HOME AND ITS MANAGEMENT mover ; do not let the lye touch clothing or hands . For staining floors , any one of many floor stains may be used . Ask for an oil stain without varnish , selecting the desired color . One quart is enough to stain one good-sized room . Put stain on with large brush . Dry for twenty-four hours ; wipe the surface off with dry cloth , then wax with common floor wax . If such a floor is waxed once a month , it should last a year without restaining . Once a year scrub off all wax and stain again . To make oil stain yourself use i3 oil to i3 turpentine , a little drier and dry stain of the desired color . Walls . There are laws regarding walls and wall paper . Many cities have this law . " No wall paper shall be placed upon a wall unless all wall paper shall be first removed and said wall thoroughly cleaned . " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept before a room is repapered . As papered walls can not be washed , in apartment houses or in crowded quarters they are always a source of danger . If there are germs of any kind resulting from disease or dirt , they find a resting place on wall paper , and paper can not be sterilized because it can not be washed . If vermin of any kind get into a house , behind the wall paper is the most natural place for them to hide , as dampness and darkness are what attract them . Paint is a safeguard against vermin . Soap is a disinfectant . Painted walls can be washed and , therefore , absolutely sterilized . A plain coloring is a better background for furnishing ( especially for pictures ) than a figured paper . Kalsomine or Cold Water Paint comes in beautiful // colors , and it is so easily put on that any one can kalsomine a wall . This kalsomine can not be washed , but it makes an inexpensive wall covering and can be put on fresh once a year if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable . To Paper Walls . Make a thick paste of two pounds of fine flour and cold water stirred together . Add to this about one-fourth pound of glue . Add enough boiling water to make the paste the consistency of cream . Cool . Vet the wall rather than the paper with this paste . Use large flat brush in putting on paper . Keep some wall paper on hand , in case paper on wall needs patching . No rule regarding the color of walls can be laid down . It is all a matter of taste and education . Different nations have different ideas . The Italians love bright colors . The Japanese and Chinese have brought to us wonderful combinations . The walls of a room should be thought of as the framework to what the room contains . Nothing destroys the effect of a room so much as a staring wall paper . The tint of the ceiling must be one that shades into the wall paper , not one that contrasts with it . Window Shades . Shades are seldom beautiful in themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a means of darkening the rooms . Shades are apt to become discolored and torn if the window is opened from the top . Therefore , there is some advantage in having inside shutters or curtains instead of shades . If curtains are used as protection , they should be made of a material that does not fade ; for example , net , pongee , linen , blue denim . Hang these curtains next to the win84 THE HOME AND ITS MANAGEMENT dow on white celluloid rings so that they can be moved back and forth easily on a brass rod . The white rings wash with the curtains , while brass rings tarnish with damp-ness . Prass clasps to hold back the curtains when the window is open will keep them from blowing out of the window or into a gas-light . Inside curtains hung for decoration and not protection should be very thin ; so that the light can come through ; short , so that the dust from the floor can not reach them ; and made of washable material . Chairs . Have chairs where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in front of the fire , by the table where the lamp stands . Do n't place a chair just because you Think it looks well in a certain spot . Staining Furniture . The furniture ( when bought in the white ) can be stained with alcohol stain and waxed with floor wax . If the furniture is varnished and one wishes to stain it , re-move the varnish with " varnish-remover , " then wash the wood clean with benzine . After it is dry , stain with alco-hol stain , dry , and wax . Alcohol stain is made by mixing dry Aniline stain with alcohol . The proportion of each should be regulated ac-cording to the shade desired ? if the color is too dark , add more alcohol ; if too light , add more stain . Only the Aniline stains dissolve in the alcohol . Oiling and Waxing Furniture . In old times cabinet makers used no varnish or shellac . // They covered the wood with boiled linseed oil and bees-wax and rubbed it with a soft cloth until the wood was sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is usually from lack of use . Any one can repair a stiff lock . Take lock off with screw driver , keep screws in relation to right holes . Soak lock and lock plate in kerosene oil , and oil all parts with oil dropper . If , after taking the lock off , you find the spring broken , take it to a locksmith . ( It will cost only half as much as bringing the locksmith to your house . ) When the lock is oiled and mended , put it back yourself , using screw driver and same screws . Loose Door Handles . This is due , usually , to the screw holes becoming large and the screws not holding . Get screws a size larger , and the trouble usually will be remedied . Never have cheap brass in locks or catches . If you can not afford good brass , have iron or a cheaper material . Avoid imitation . Receptacle for Soiled Clothes . A white clothes box made of white papier mache is sanitary , easily washed , and fits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , and is ugly when filled with soiled clothes . A clothes basket is hard to wash , and the odor. of the clothes gets into the straw . // A good receptacle for soiled clothes is a pickle barrel , price fifty cents . Holes should be bored in the sides to admit air , and a barrel top may be purchased at any hardware store . This kept in an unused corner , serves also as a seat , and is less bulky than a straw basket . To Take Paint from Glass . Use soda and boiling water . If the paint has been long on the glass use varnish remover . Gas Meter . Ask the gas man once to tell you how to read the gas meter , and you will be able to keep account of this house expense . Rattling Windows . If the windows ' rattle , tighten the window fastening by taking off the plate with a screw driver . Replace it a little further back so that the windows are held closer together . Mica Shades . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ones for five minutes in vinegar and water . Matting . To clean matting , wipe over with cloth wrung out in salt and water ; then wipe dry . Enamel Paint . If enamel paint is too highly polished , rub it with a light pumice stone and oil . How and When to Save Money . The first thing is to realize the value of education in the matter of buying those things which every one must // purchase to live . Women are the great purchasers of household supplies , and they do not play the game of living intelligently if they do not learn how to buy . The second thing is , education is not learning something by heart or taking as truth what some one else tells you . Education trains us to think . If we learn to think for ourselves we will be able to estimate the relative importance of things . On certain things one can save money , on others it is wiser to spend money . Take advantage of every labor-saving device you can afford . Many get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that if a new device is at first confusing they will not accept it . Do n't save money ( unless economy demands it ) on a mattress . You get just what you pay for . A hair mattress will last twice as long as a cotton mattress . Do n't save money on a moving man if you have good furniture . A cheap man may do more damage to one piece of furniture than what you have saved . You do n't save money by buying coal or groceries in small quantities . In the end you pay nearly twice as much . You do n't save money by buying cheap furniture , varnished to look expensive . Furniture should last two or three generations . It will pay in the end to have it made of good wood . You save nothing by buying on the instalment plan . This is only a loan from the company which you pay little by little , adding the interest on the loan to the payment . Save all the money needed first , and then buy your furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in this way . If linen is laundered at home ( not in a steam laundry ) it pays to get good linen . It does not pay to get more // than you need . If bed linen and towels are laundered at a laundry , buy them cheap , as they will not last anyway . Save money where frequent renewals are inevitable , as with china and glass . Expensive pieces break as quickly as cheaper ones ; they are no cleaner , they make the food no better . Neither expensive ones nor cheap ones suffer from wear and tear . It is breakage that destroys the usefulness of china and glass . Save money on curtains . These are destroyed by sun , dampness and air , and expensive material is as easily affected by these things as cheaper material . Save money on tin kitchen ware . It rusts soon with the best of care . Do n't save money on brass or copper utensils : they last forever if of good material . Tools . You can not keep your house in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brooms , brushes and cloths to clean with , but tools to repair what is out of order . Have a basket made of wood containing hammer , screw driver , awl , wrench , nails , tacks , wire , large scissors and any other tools that your particular need requires . This basket can be taken from one place to another and the tools will not get mislaid . CHAPTER VIII LAUNDRY WORK Laundry Equipment . Before doing the first stroke of work a good workman is sure that he has at hand all the necessary tools and material for the performance of his particular task . This is true of every piece of work , if you would keep your mind and work orderly . In this task , be sure that you have time enough ; hurried work is usually poor work . Second , see that the place you have to work in is the best at your command . A light , airy basement is the ideal laundry ; but the majority of women must use the kitchen . If the kitchen is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soiled clothes ( many of them underclothes ) are not about at the time the food is cooking . On washday very simple food should be served and as much of this as possible cooked the day before . This is the cleanest , easiest , and most orderly way . As the stove will be needed for the clothes-boiler and irons , there will be but little space for pots and pans . Stove . In some'homes , where space and money are plentiful , there are laundry stoves separate from cooking stoves . Such stoves are never blackened , because the irons must be kept absolutely clean ; they are rubbed clean with a dry brush . 89 // In the majority of homes the cooking-stove is used for irons . Therefore , be very careful that on ironing-days , especially , the stove is rubbed as free from blacking as is possible . Tubs . Porcelain or soapstone tubs are the best ; wooden tubs absorb odors . The most desirable stationary tubs are set away from the wall , but these are seldom found in apartments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more care for the housewife , to keep dry every crack and edge and hidden crevice . If galvanized tubs are used , be careful that they do not rust . Dry well and occasionally oil . In the country , portable wooden tubs are used ; if these are allowed to become too dry , between washings , they will fall apart . When in use such tubs are placed on a bench , which should be about thirty-six inches high . The advantage of portable tubs in the country is , that they make it possible to wash out of doors , and fresh air and sunlight sweeten the clothes . Stoves and tubs are what are called stationary equipment and are usually put in by the landlord ; but every woman or girl is responsible for their condition when wash-day comes . It is only a bad housekeeper who uses her tubs as a storing place between washings . Damp tubs breed cockroaches . Movable Equipment . If the laundress is the right kind of laundress , she will see that all equipment necessary for washing and ironing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // In a small kitchen many things that we have for every-day use may be utilized in our laundry work , thus avoiding unnecessary things about , and also saving expense . Rubbing-Board . There are three kinds : Glass . Which is most easily cared for , and wears longest . Zinc covered boards . Wooden boards . Which are the least desirable . Wringer . This is not a necessity , but helps to make easier the wringing of clothes . It is more economical to buy a wringer of good quality , even if more expensive . A good wringer requires very careful treatment . To keep the rubber-rollers clean , it is very necessary after each washing , to unroll them and wipe them dry . A very good housekeeper will have a slip bag to keep her rollers in . Boiler . An oblong boiler is more practical than a round one ; it holds more clothes and fits better on the stove . A copper boiler will outlast all others , but it is expensive . A tin boiler , with copper bottom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler is cheap but it does not last . Any boiler must be carefully dried after each washing . HAVE ON HAND ON LAUNDRY DAY Clothes-Stick . An old broom-handle is as good a stick as any other to take clothes from the boiler . Pail .

Small piece of perfectly clean cloth , always at hand to rub off any spots . Equipment for Ironing . Ironing-table or board . It should be covered with flannel or a coarse blanket , and cotton cloth pinned tightly over this . A drawer in an ironing-table is a great convenience . Irons . There are many kinds of irons : gas and electric , which are expensive . Nickel-plated . These do not rust . Iron ones are the most common and many a laundress will use no other kind . These must be of different sizes . They must be kept smooth . When not in use keep in a dry , clean place . Wash , and heat irons before using // Iron-holders . Do not use any old rag for an iron-holder , but take time to make three or four holders of bright , pretty material . Iron-stand . A tin cover may be used for this . Wax . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothing irons . Heavy paper and cloth . This to test the heat of the irons ; never try them on the ironing board . Materials Used in Laundry Work . Soap .

Bluing , in liquid form , is usually a compound of ferro-ferric oxide ; that is , an iron com-pound , and injurious to clothes in combination with an alkali . Soap is an alkali ; therefore , clothes not well rinsed , after bluing , will often show rust-marks . Starch . It will pay to get the best . There are many liquids for removing stains , such as Javelle water , ether , etc. , but any girl who is not a trained laundress can not be trusted with these things ; when not used properly they spoil the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of laundry equipment that may for some reason be missing , even in the home of a good house-keeper . It will be interesting for any one studying this book to take note of any substitution that has taken place in her home . // Body Clothes . Clothes which are worn absorb waste matter thrown off from the body in the form of perspiration , and in bits of dead skin which are being constantly rubbed off . The food that we eat repairs this waste . Our undercloth ing , because of this waste matter , becomes damp , sticky , and oily . Unclean clothes increase the heat of the body in summer and make it colder in winter . A bath every day , winter and summer , followed by clean clothes at least twice a week in winter and oftener in summer , will do much to prevent discomfort and illness . In the case of small children clean clothes will often stop their fretting , which indicates irritation . As every girl knows , dust must be removed , if for no other reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sorting the Clothes . Sorting is the separation of clothes , before washing , into the divisions in which they are to be washed . Before beginning the actual washing , it will make the labor much more interesting to know something of the materials that are to be washed . The care of the stove is more interesting work after studying about coal and wood . Care of household garbage is interesting when we know about the municipal problems in the disposition of the city waste . This rule holds , good in laundering . The materials ordinarily laundered are linen , cotton , silk and wool . // Linen . Linen is not so good . for many things as cotton ; it wrinkles easily and is much more expensive . For the table however it is the best material to use ; its smooth , brilliant texture adds to the beauty of the table ; it looks fresh and clean and when properly laundered lasts well . Linen is woven from flax . Flax is a plant which grows from two to three feet high , bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flax begin to ripen the plant is pulled up by the roots . Then follows a process called " rippling " by which the seeds are taken from the plant . The stalk is then steeped in water to produce fermentation . Then comes " scutching , " by which the fibre is freed from its woody core ; then a process called " heckling " by which the fiber is combed out , straightened , and the longer threads separated from the woolly mass . " Spinning " is twisting the fiber into thread . " Weaving " is the art of producing the linen cloth from a combination of these threads . Making linen of flax is but one of the uses of the flax plant . The seed is very nutritive ; linseed oil , which is made from the seed , is a great industry . Flax used to be raised on individual farms , and the women of the family took the flax after the heckling and with their own hands did the spinning , weaving , bleaching , and finishing . The cultivation of cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of machinery did away with flax-growing and weaving as an individual farm in , industry ; even dragging up the flax by the roots is all done now by machinery . Hand-linen looms are not used to-day , and many families were ruined when the machinery for making linen was introduced , as their handlooms were their only wealth . In the process of making linen , " finishing " is the last // step . It is in this finishing that the linen manufacturers are able to deceive the public . This finishing or sizing is the gloss on the linen ; it is often simply starch ironed in , and polished hard . The starch will wash out with the first laundering . When you buy linen the way to test good from bad is to rub a piece of it between the fingers ; if it is thickened with starch instead of being really heavy linen , the starch will come off on your fingers ; also after you have rubbed a little of the starch out . the linen will have a thin look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . Cotton Cloth . Underclothes often are made of cotton cloth , so also is what we call " bed-linen . " This expression comes from the old times when sheets and pillow-cases always were made o f linen . Linen is too expensive now to be used generally for sheets . Cotton is now our chief vegetable fiber . At least six billion pounds a year are produced , and the United States raises the larger part of this . Cotton is the white downy covering of the cotton-plant , and the value of the cotton depends upon the evenness and strength of the fiber . In cheap cotton the fiber is about an inch long ; in good material the fiber is two inches long . Long fiber cotton is used for fine cotton laces , fine lawn , and muslin goods , while the " short fiber cotton is made into inexpensive cloth . One reason why cotton is cheap is that there is only five per cent loss in preparing it for use . There is not time in a book like this to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girl should know good cotton cloth from a poor quality . It is true in cotton , as in linen , that the finish or sizing is deLAUNDRY // ceptive . This , too , can be put on with starch which , when washed out , leave the cloth loosely woven and flimsy . Rub the cloth , and feel it with your fingers and you will soon be able to judge the quality . Do not blame the woman behind the counter if you find that you have bought a nightgown , for example , that looks cheap after a few washings . The saleswoman does not make the goods , and does not set the price ; very likely she herself has no knowledge of cottons . She is paid to make you buy the nightgown . It is well to remember a few good rules about readymade cotton underclothes . If an article is cheaper than the market price there is usually some reason for it ; if it is being sold at a marked-down sale it is worth while to examine it very carefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels thin and loosely woven do not buy it , no matter how tempting the bargain . If any one gets good cloth and good work she has to pay for them . Colored Cotton Cloth . Gingham is made of yarn which is dyed before it is woven into cloth . Cretonne , chintz , and calico are made into cloth and then stamped . Outing cloth , which is an imitation of wool , is soft and light and made of cotton . It does not shrink like wool , the best grades do not fade , but it has not the warmth of wool . Flannels . Flannel , which is all wool , is made from the soft , hairy covering of sheep and goats . The wool of the llama of South Africa also is used in making stuffs for women 's wear . Sheep-raising was a business long before agriculture was known ; in fact so long ago that no one knows // when man first realized that the wool of sheep was valuable . As soon as wool began to be used for cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was done by careful breeding , careful feeding , and by protecting the wool-bearing animals in bad weather ; in other words , the more domestic a sheep is , the softer and finer the wool . Much of the wool used in this country conies from Australia , South America , and South Africa . The wools used for blankets and carpets come from a lower quality of sheep , where the hair is harder and coarser . Cashmere wool is the most costly of all wools , and comes from the cashmere goat in the Himalaya Mountains . In old times , wool manufacture was a home industry , just as linen was . The beautiful hand-spinning and weaving clone then has not been excelled to this day . The first wool machine in this country was in Pittsfield , Massachusetts , in 1790 . Manufacture of Woolens and Worsteds . First , the sheep is washed , and then sheared ; the wool is then beaten to get rid of dust and other impurities , then washed again . This second washing , after the wool is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove dirt but a fatty secretion , called " yolk . " Wool is washed in a soapy solution , often with soda added ; and is passed from one tub to another until it conies from the last tub comparatively clean ; it is then dried , bleached , or dyed . Even after all this , the wool has a matted appearance , and contains some dust and sand . The process of removing this is called " willowing , " and is done by a machine that gently tears the matted locks apart . and frees the wool of all impurities. // " Mixing " comes next , and is a process whereby wools of different quality are mixed together . If other material , such as silk or cotton , is to be blended with the wool , it is clone at this time . Oiling . The wool , after its many washings , is hard and wiry , and in order to restore its natural softness it is. slightly oiled while it is being mixed . Up to this point worsteds and woolens go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : worsted thread is combed and the thread twisted until it becomes hard ; woolen yarn , from which woolen goods are made , is simply carded and loosely spun . Carding . This process produces a thread whose fibers lie loosely , projecting from the main thread in little ends which form the nap of the cloth . Spinning is the art of drawing and twisting this fiber so that it is formed into continuous threads , ready for weaving or knitting . Weaving . This is the art of making thread into cloth . Stains on Clothes . As a good laundress sorts her clothes she will look for stains . Any garment or article having a stain on it should be laid aside , for if put into hot soapy water it will set the stain and make it difficult to remove . Blood Stains . Wash in cold water , then rub with naphtha soap , and soak in warm water . If the stain remains apply a paste of raw starch . Chocolate or Tea . Sprinkle with borax and soak in cold water ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come out . Coffee , Fruit . Lay the stained part over a bowl and pour boiling water on it ; have the water come from a height so as to give it force . zoo THE HOME AND ITS MANAGEMENT Glue . Vinegar rubbed on with a cloth will remove glue . Grass Stains . Warm water and naphtha soap should take out grass stain . If on white goods ammonia may be added . Grease . Wash in gasoline and then warm water and soap . Ink . Let the stained part stand in milk , and when the milk is discolored change it to fresh milk . Wash next in cold water , and lastly wash in warm water with a little ammonia , if the goods are white . Ink on Carpet . 1st . Take up all possible ink with a spoon . 2nd . Lay on carpet blotting paper ; press well into carpet . Take fresh piece and repeat . 3rd . Wash stain with warm water and ammonia . Use milk if you have no ammonia . Kerosene . Use Fuller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stain for twenty-four hours . Machine Oil . Wash first with soap and cold water , and then rub with turpentine if the stain is not removed . Mildew . Usually it is our own fault if the clothes are mildewed ; they have been neglected and left damp in a close place . If they should become mildewed , squeeze lemon juice on the stain , and lay it in the sunlight . If this does not remove the stain , make a paste of soap , starch , lemon and salt , and let this paste stand on the spot for twenty-four hours . Milk . If on a colored dress , wash with cold water . Paint . Use benzine or turpentine . Perspiration . Soap-suds and sunshine . Scorch . Rub the scorched article with lemon and put in the sun . Stove Polish . Naphtha soap and cold water . LAUNDRY WORK iot Wagon Grease . Rub with lard and then wash with warm water and soap . Wa.r . Place brown paper over grease spot and press paper with warm iron . Wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then pour boiling water over the spot , as in fruit stains . The next step after sorting clothes and looking for stains is to : Soak Clothes . This is clone to loosen the dirt so that the garment will require less rubbing when washed . Add a little soap to the water in which clothes are soaked . Stockings and colored clothes are not soaked . Clothes are soaked usually over night . In the morning wring out the clothes . Wash the tubs and fill nearly full of hot water . Fill the boiler half full of cold water and acid enough dissolved soap to make a light suds . Put a coarse , clean cloth in bottom of the boiler , to prevent clothes scorching . You are now ready to wash , not to talk about it , but to do the actual work . In clothes , as in dishes , the cleanest are washed first . Table and Bed Linen . Put these in one tub of hot water ; use soap freely . As each piece is washed wring it with the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When all of this first lot are in the second tub , wash them again with soap , as before ; as each piece is washed and wrung from this tub , drop it in the boiler of cold water . When the boiler is full start the fire , if it is a gas or electric stove ; put the boiler over the hot fire , if it is a coal stove . Press the clothes down with a wooden stick , which is also needed to turn the clothes and take them from the boiler . While the first tubful of clothes is scalding in the boiler , // rub out the second tubful of underclothes which are the next cleanest , in the same manner : When the second lot is ready for the boiler , the first should have finished boiling and be ready to take out . Put these in a tub of clear water . Wash the third lot , which will be the more soiled clothes and towels , while the second lot is in the boiler . Take the second lot from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , and then put third washing in the boiler . It is now time to rinse the first and second clothes . First , wash out and thoroughly clean the tubs that have been used in washing , as they are to be used for the rinsing . Fill both tubs with clear hot water ; rinse and wring from one tub into the other , then wring out into bluing water . The last boiler of clothes should be rinsed in the same way and blued . As the clothes are wrung out from the bluing water separate those that require starching . Bluing Water . Use clean cold water , and have the bluing ball tied in a cloth , to prevent specks coming onto the clothes . Never allow the clothes to stand in this water , as they will become streaked , and never , for the same reason , allow them to rest on the bottom of the tub . Hanging . Be sure the lines are clean and tight . Every time they are used they must be wiped with a clean , damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken : Hang clothes of a kind together , and hang white clothes in the sunlight , if possible . All articles should be hung on the wrong side . Hang the sheets out first , as they " take the longest time to dry . In hanging fine pieces , and the underclothes , be careful that the . clothes-pins do not tear the garments . // Starched Clothes . Bed linen , towels , table linen and handkerchiefs should never be starched . People differ about underclothes . Many care for no starch , while others wish a little , realizing that garments iron more easily when starched , and keep clean longer . To Make Thick Starch . Half cup of starch , Half cup of cold water , One quart of boiling water . One quarter teaspoonful of lard or wax , One teaspoonful of , borax . Mix the starch with cold water , and make smooth ; slowly add wax , borax , and boiling water . Allow the starch to cook about fifteen minutes , and then strain . Use the starch hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; wax keeps irons from sticking . Thin starch . This is made in the same way , except that three quarts of hot water , instead of one quart , are added . Wring clothes out in hot starch while they are still wet . Hang them out of the wind to dry ; wind blows the starch from the clothes . Raw starch . Two tablespoonfuls of starch , One half teaspoonful of borax , Two cups of cold water . Dissolve the borax in a little hot water ; mix starch with cold water and add this to the borax . This is used for starching shirts and collars and cuffs . When cold water is used , the articles to be starched must be thoroughly dry before starching . As each article // is starched , squeeze it and roll it in a towel for an hour before ironing . Woolens and Flannels . As these require great care to prevent them from shrinking , it is well to do them on a day separate from the regular wash day . All woolen material should be washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same temperature . In the first water use a soap solution ; never rub soap on the garment . If woolen garments are not thoroughly rinsed , so that no soap remains , they will not be soft . When washing , do not rub flannels more than is necessary , as rubbing hardens and thickens them . Use borax and ammonia if the water is hard . Dry flannels in the sun or in the air ; never near a hot stove . Squeeze dry , and shake well , before hanging . Hang wrong side out . Never let flannels freeze because it shrinks them . White clothes are not injured by freezing . It is well to bring flannels indoors before they are perfectly dry ; roll them in clean cloths and iron as soon as possible . Blue flannel will keep its color better if a tablespoonful of vinegar is added to the rinsing water . White flannels are blued , as are other white clothes , but great care must be taken to have the water of the same temperature as the washing water . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow them to get very soiled before washing , as rubbing hard injures them . Second . Wash in lukewarm water , one piece at a time . Third . Do not soak flannels , as it hardens them ; do not boil , as it shrinks them ; wash quickly . // Fourth . Rinsing and bluing waters should be of the same temperature as the washing water . Fifth . Shake flannels before washing and shake them after washing , before hanging . Blankets . Select a clear , windy day in which to wash blankets . Fill two tubs with lukewarm water ; pour a soap solution into one tub and a weak soda solution into the other . Dissolve three tablespoonfuls of borax in a quart of water and divide this between the two tubs . Shake the blankets ; then put one pair into the first tub , sop it up and down until the dirt is out of it ; squeeze the water out and put it in the next tub ; sop up and down as before . Now rinse the blankets very thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Run the blankets through a wringer , if you have one . Shake hard before hanging up to dry . Hang , by firmly pinning in many places , so that no great strain may come on any one part of the blanket . If there are any soiled spots remaining on the blanket spread it on a board and rub with a brush ; rubbing with the hands twists the fiber . Have fresh water for each pair of blankets . Be sure that the blankets are perfectly dry before they are taken from the line ; brush with a soft brush after drying or beat with a clean furniture beater . Fold and place between sheets with a heavy weight on the top ; this is better than ironing . Colored Clothes . To set the color in clothes before washing , rinse the colored garments in one gallon of water to which has been added , either , one tablespoonful of salt or one quarter cup io6 THE HOME AND ITS MANAGEMENT of vinegar . Colored clothes should never be soaked . Do not use much soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only warm ; do not use strong , yellow soap or washingpowder or ammonia ; do not rub any soap on the garment but wash in suds . Colored clothes must not be boiled or blued . Dry quickly and dry in the shade . If a girl will remember all of the " don'ts " connected with the washing of colored clothes , she may be trusted to wash them . To Wash Silks . Make warm , soapy water of Ivory soap . Rub article to be washed as little as possible ; squeeze the dirt out so as not to hurt the weave . Do not use ammonia on white silk ; it makes it yellow . One teaspoonful of borax dissolved in a pint of oiling water softens the water . This is sufficient for two tubs of water and should be added to the soapy water . Rinse in two waters ; wring as gently as possible , and hang out to dry . When half dry , take in , roll tightly in clean cloth , towel or sheet ; let it stand thus for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading them on a clean board , scrubbing them with a soft brush , rinsing well and pressing the same as silk . Do not use too hot an iron on silk ; it makes it stiff . Stockings . Great care should he given to the washing of stockings . Clean , fresh stockings mean warmer feet in winter and cooler feet in summer . Stockings rinsed out but not washed are not . " clean " stockings . Stockings should be first washed on the right side and then turned and washed on the wrong side . Never rinse stockings in water that has been used for other clothes , as // it contains lint . It is well to rinse new stockings in salt water to set the color . Silk stockings are washed like other silk goods . Woolen stockings are washed the same as flannels . Cleaning of Tubs . This is the last task connected with washing , and is most important . First , the tubs should be scrubbed to remove the grease and scum . Lint from the clothes is very bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda water after every washing . If the water runs slowly down the pipes , even after using soda , pour down potash and boiling water . Dry the tubs , and the woodwork all about them . Do not use tubs for anything between washings . IRONING It is not possible to learn ironing with a few trials ; for knowledge of this art comes only with practice . Ironing is like cooking ; all that any book can do is to start a girl in the right way . As was taught in the very begin ning of the laundry lessons , do not begin to iron until everything for the work is at hand . Go over once more the necessary things . First , be sure the work of covering the ironing-board is understood . Every girl should be able to cover an ironing-board so that it will be smooth and tight . To obtain good results , clothes must be well dampened . Spread each article out on a clean cloth and sprinkle one rob THE HOME AND ITS MANAGEMENT piece at a time . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used for nothing else . Then roll the clothes , turning in the edges as you roll . Plain articles , such as towels , napkins , handkerchiefs , may be rolled together . After sprinkling and rolling , it is a good thing to let them stand several hours before ironing . Starched clothes need to be damper than those that are not starched , except those with cold water starch . There are always some clothes that do not require ironing , such as knitted underwear , woolens and stockings . It is only necessary to smooth these out well and fold carefully ; they are fresher if not ironed . Be very sure that the irons are clean before heating . Place the articles needed for the ironing on the ironingboard , at the right . Iron the coarser things first , as the irons become smoother the longer they are used . First towels , then napkins , table doilies , sheets and pillow-cases , and handkerchiefs . Be careful that the hems are properly ironed and the edges even ? edge to edge . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wrong side . Fold hems of sheets together and fold wrong side out . Iron table-linen on the right side . Iron all pieces until dry , that is , until all steam stops rising . Underclothes . If there is embroidery , iron this first . Then the sleeves , the yoke , and lastly the body of the garment . Iron over as large a space at one time as possible , and do the work rapidly , or the garment will dry . Skirts . The ruffle is ironed first , then the band , and lastly the body of the skirt . // Any garment with folds and seams should hang for a while before being folded ; it is difficult to get the seams perfectly dry with the iron . Starched clothes require a very hot iron . Remember the appearance of table linen and handker-chiefs depends upon the way they are folded . Fold all napkins alike so they will look the same on the table . Iron an embroidered article on a Turkish towel ; this will make the embroidery stand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand on the stove ; they lose their temper , and are not able to hold the heat . CHAPTER IX MARKETING How to Learn Marketing . The only way to learn how to cook is by cooking , day after day , making mistakes , producing unexpectedly good results , blundering along , working , working , working , until finally you instinctively know the taste of the pud-ding before you begin to combine the ingredients . You know instantly what flavoring is lacking in the stew the moment you taste it . You can make an entire meal from the left-overs in the ice-box by adding here and combin-ing there ; and never will you waste so much as one egg shell . Only then are you a first-class cook . Marketing is mastered in the same way . Not one visit to the market with a teacher can teach you how to buy . All that teachers and books can do is to give you the rules to work by . Taste , education , income , digestibility , time , all go toward making a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the store . The ice-box , the window shelf that holds the left-over food , the bread box ; these are the first places to visit . Any one can go to the market and buy steak , vegetables , salad and a dessert . It takes an artist of the kitchen to see in the liquid part of the left-over mutton stew the foundation of a clam chowder ; or see the possibility of , good meat balls in the strained-off pieces of meat , the few pieces of stale bread in the bread-box and one onion . To a woman with a creative mind the cold cereal of yes-terday is not something for the garbage pail , but thicken-IIo MARKETING I I I ing for soup . All children do . not like cereals plain . A wise housekeeper is glad of the chance to give such a child this nourishing food in combination with other foods . In the ice-box the good housekeeper may find the water that yesterday 's corned beef was cooked in , or the vegetable water from yesterday 's beets . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef ' water instead of pork ; or with vegetables , adding the beet water to soup stock . A few pieces of stale cake are in the cake box ; that means that with one egg , a little milk , sugar and chocolate you have the pudding for ( limier . Now when you start for the butcher 's and the grocer 's you buy only what will supplement and make into new combinations the food at home . What are some of the foundation principles that every housewife should carry with her to the market and what are some of the faults she should overcome ? Waste is one of America 's greatest faults . You want the meat of an egg to-day rather than the egg shell , but it is wasteful not to foresee that to-morrow morning you will want the shell to clear the coffee . In the same foolish way , women buy meat , and stand and look on while the butcher ( having made those women first pay for the entire weight ) trims off the fat , and cuts out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the counter to be sold again ; and yet these women know that the bone is good for soup and the fat for frying . Why do they do it ? Indifference and laziness . What the butcher cuts off is yours , ask him for it . Another rule to carry to market is : do n't buy in small quantities . Space is valuable , and storage place is sadly lacking in most homes , but many buy five cents ' worth of this , ten cents ' worth of that , because no thought has been given to using what space there is. // Glass jars take up very little room ; they cost only from five to twenty-five cents each , and they last forever . Put a shelf in the kitchen ; and on it a row of one and two quart jars , each holding a dry grocery ; and you have added to the beauty of your kitchen , you have saved money by making it possible to buy in quantity , and you have saved the labor of running out overy clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should always be in the house . Do n't try to buy cheaper than the market price . If butter is selling for forty-one cents a pound , and you can buy it for thirty cents , there is something the matter with the butter . When you think you buy forty-five cent eggs for twenty-five cents , you do n't ; you buy only twenty-five cent eggs . The salesman deceives you by making you believe you are saving money , instead of telling you that you are paying a good price for poor eggs . In some shops sugar , flour , rice , etc. , are all done up in pound packages ; to save time , " you are told . Have the dry groceries you buy weighed out before you . It takes a little more of your time , but you get the full weight for your money . When you buy by the package , you pay for paper and the labor of packing . One half pound of loose soda crackers has thirty-five crackers , and costs five cents . One package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You sacrifice eleven crackers for the paper package . Meat . To buy meat to the best advantage a girl must know the different cuts ; which ones are tough and which are tender ; where the juicy parts lie ; what the proportion of meat is to bone in each cut and why the quality and // price of the meat is different in one part from another . This knowledge may be gained by a careful study of meat charts ; by asking questions of those who know , and more than all else by going to market and learning by experience . To acquire a perfect knowledge of the charts given in this chapter is a good way to begin the study of meats . Take , first , Fig. 3 . This is the skeleton of beef . The vertebrae run from head to tail . Study the bones in the spine with the help of the text underneath , so that when you see those bones in the butcher shop you will know at once from which part of the animal each cut comes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two down the back bone . Remember this when you try to locate the bones as seen in the picture . See Fig. 4. // // A careful study of the text under these two cuts will give you a clear knowledge of where the porterhouse steak , the rib roasts , the chuck , the round steaks , etc. , come from . No matter , at first , about the cost ; learn only the location of the various cuts ; be familiar with the names , and learn what cuts have little and what have much bone . Now pass on to Fig. 5 and again study the different cuts ; this time with thought as to price and the quality of the meat . This book quotes prices of meats in normal times . The cuts of beef can be divided into three qualities ; first , those from the middle of the back , called ribs . There are seven of these ribs , as you can see by counting in Fig. 3 . They are marked 6 in Fig. 5 . Porterhouse , sirloin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are the most expensive cuts ; in New York // City the meat costs from twenty-four to thirty cents a pound . These roasts and steaks are also the tenderest part , because they are the least muscular , that is the least exercised . There is , as you will see in Fig. 3 , a great deal of bone that you pay for when you buy these expensive cuts . As the butcher cuts the meat from nearer the head and nearer the tail he charges less . Cuts from these parts of the beef are the second quality . Rump and round , marked 1 and 2 on Fig. 5 , are the back cuts , and the chuck ( marked 7 ) is the part near the head . In both of these extremities the meat is more muscular . Watch a cow moving its head back and forth , or notice the constant motion of its hind legs , and you will see at once how much more the muscles are used here than in the hack . Although this makes the meat less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality cuts less bone and fat than in the rib ; and the meat has more flavor , and is juicier . The tenderness is gained by longer cooking . The chuck and round make excellent rolled steaks and pot roasts . The round is used because of its juicy quality for making beef broth , beef tea , scraped beef and stew . These second quality cuts , in New York , are from eighteen to twenty-four cents a pound . The third quality is the toughest meat ; that on the legs , that part below the neck called , the brisket ( marked 9 on Fig. 5 ) and the meat on the belly , called the navel and plate ( 1i and 12 on the chart ) . From the neck we get good stew meat , beef for broiling and mince meat . The brisket , navel and flank are often put into brine and sold as corned beef . The heavy part under the ribs is sold too for stew meat and pot roasts .

This shin or soup meat costs sixteen cents for the meat , not counting bone which is thrown in . Every part of the animal is utilized . The bone which is not used in our kitchens is ground into manure or turned into numerous articles ; the skin is made into leather , the ears and hoofs into glue ; the hair is mixed with mortar : and the horns are cut and molded into spoons and other useful articles . Mutton or Lamb . This meat is called lamb if the animal is less than a year old , after the year it is called mutton . The first eight ribs on a lamb are what we call mutton chops , next to these rib chops and nearer the tail are the loin chops . ( These rib and loin parts are marked 2 in Fig. 6 . ) The // loin mutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better to buy than the ribs because there is more // meat in comparison with the bone . When the thin bones of the rib chops are trimmed they are called French chops . The leg is the most economical cut of mutton because there is so little waste . The shoulder makes a good , cheap roast for a large family . Roasts , stew and pot pie meat are cut from the shoulder , the chuck and the flank . Pork . Pork is the flesh of the hog . Pork is more apt to be diseased than any other meat and the ways to know healthy pork from unhealthy should be known to every housewife . Pork should be cooked a long time and it is a good rule not to buy pork in hot weather . The quality of the meat depends upon many things ; age of the animal , kind of food eaten by the hog , the way the meat is prepared for market and the length of time it has hung after being killed and dressed .
