The Autumn Garden ( by Lillian Hellman ; produced by Kermit Bloomgarden ) is a strikingly new kind of Lillian Hellman play . The plot is not at all striking and is secondary to the people ; the people are pretty average people , neither vipers nor vixens . The scene is the South-an elegant summer boarding house run by a wellborn , middle-aged spinster . The guests are largely people of her own generation and kind-fiberless , frustrated people : a quiet , cynical drinker who has never married ; a quiet-seeking general married to a fool ; a confused young man halfheartedly about to marry the spinster 's French niece . <P> Into this world after 23 years away from it , bursts the spinster 's girlhood beau-a selfish , tinny charmer ( Fredric March ) who dabbles at art and meddles in lives-with the rich wife who knows him for what he is and even puts up with all he is n't . He buzzes , jollies , flirts , cajoles , tipsily involves the French niece in a minor small-town scandal . Though baseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people into auditing their close-to-bankrupt lives . <P> People , The Autumn Garden contends , are the products of all their past acts , so that for most of them the middle of the journey is equally the destination . The play 's point-that lack of character is also fate-is driven sharply home . Its people , , though much alike in stature and background , are vividly drawn and brilliantly differentiated . Miss Hellman 's portraits , without being unsympathetic , are adultly uncompromising . <P> What blurs and scatters the general effect is a need , not for a more dramatic plot , but for a more incisive pattern . The boarding house brings together numerous people not closely enough related to form a homogeneous group , nor sufficiently unrelated to create the diversified world-in-little of a Grand Hotel . There is not enough significant interplay ; characters constantly mingle but seldom merge . There is rather the sort of populous , externally shared living that is the basis of social comedy . And the play offers effective social comedy through such types as a tart matriarch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the returning beau . <P> Yet Miss Hellman 's real emphasis is on separate frustrations and intimate crises , so that a Southern comedy of manners is always rubbing elbows with a Chekhovian study of character . And The Autumn Garden has the relaxed Chekhov method without his unifying lyrical mood-his sense that if people delude themselves , life is itself delusive . Actually Chekhov cuts deeper than Miss Hellman because , being a realist rather than a moralist , he very seldom grants his characters the ability to face the truth about themselves . <P> The Autumn Garden offers , along with the assured and vital gifts of an experienced playwright , the wavering and uncertain movement of a transitional play . It is greatly enhanced by the production : by Harold Clurman 's staging , Howard Bay 's set , the acting of Fredric March , Florence Eldridge , Ethel Griffies , Jane Wyatt , and most of all Joan Lorring in the difficult role of the niece . <P>                   @ @
