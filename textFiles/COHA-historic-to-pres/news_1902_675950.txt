BRITISH " REMOUNTS . " The more the question of the purchase of remounts for the British Army in South Africa is gone into , the graver does the scandal appear . It is the more significant because no attempt seems to have been made in the House of Commons to " make political capital " out of the business . The member who made the original charges that the Government had been swindled on a great scale was a Conservative , Sir JOHN MAPLE , and the member who gave the most damaging testimony against the War Office in yesterday 's debate , Col. ARTHUR LEE , so well known and so highly esteemed in this country , is a Conservative also . Members like this can not be suspected of any intention of embarrassing the Government , when they are simply exposing the inefficiency by which the British War Office has lent its aid , in the form of contributory negligence , to the efforts of men who were trying to cheat it . Col. MAPLE 'S specific charge was that on one purchase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit to the seller of ? 44,000 , and there was no reason to suppose that it was more than the average . At that rate , the total profit on the British expenditure for remounts of ? 18,000,000 would have been ? 8,000,000 , or . $40,000.000 , of which all above , say , 10 per cent. , would go to show the incompetency , to say the least , the rascality , to say the most , of the purchasing agents of the British Government . Col. LEE 'S testimony was more directly damaging to the War Office than any other . The chief purchases were made in Hungary and in the United States . Neither the Military Attach ? at Vienna , nor Col. LEE himself , at that time Military Attache at Washington , was even notified that a British agent was to be sent to the country to buy horses . Col. LEE received his information on the subject from the newspapers . By the courtesy of a " high official , " doubtless . the Secretary of War , the chief horse expert of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain for her purchases in this country . Of course Col. LEE forwarded this very valuable and friendly offer to the War Office . It ought to be equally of course that it was accepted with thanks . But Col. LEE declares that it was not even acknowledged . If the subordinate who did not find such an offer even worth acknowledging was not himself a rascal , and in the job of paying far more for horses than they were worth . he was evidently an amazing fool . In either case , as a London paper missed from his employment . The bear- ing of this astonishing and scandalous suggests , he ought to be at once disstory upon the pretenses of " reform " in the War Department is too plain to need pointing out . Mr. BRODRICK was able last week , even in asking for a supplemental credit of $25,000,000 , to say that the expenses of the war had been reduced to $22,500,000 a month . In the face of this new disclosure , the British taxpayer will be apt to ask himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British War Office were conducted on business principles .
