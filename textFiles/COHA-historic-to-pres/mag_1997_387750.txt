Some of the wimpiest particles in the universe power the awesome destructive fury of an exploding star . // FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS , THE MASSIVE STAR Sanduleak - 69deg202 was the master of its domain . At the height of its powers , the star was so big that 170,000 suns would have fit inside . Weighing in at 20 solar masses , Sanduleak - 69deg202 's nuclear furnace pumped out so much energy that the star shone with the brightness of 20,000 suns , dominating its region of the Large Magellanic Cloud . But like many Egyptian pharaohs , this mighty star 's glory would prove to be short-lived . One day , its nuclear furnace ran out of fuel . In a fraction of a second , the core collapsed , triggering a shock wave . The shock wave ripped through the outer layers , blowing the star to kingdom come . Poor Sanduleak-69deg202 was no more . For 167,000 years , news of the star 's catastrophic demise traversed space at the speed of light , until on February 23 , 1987 , it reached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have combed each photon of light they could get their hands on to help them better understand the story of stellar death . The fact that massive stars end their lives in titanic blasts called supernovae is old news . Astronomers have known that since the 1930s . But how do stars explode ? Surprisingly , scientists are just now gaining a detailed understanding of this process . The key development has been high speed supercomputers , which can unveil the immensely complicated and messy goings-on that occur deep inside an exploding star . Despite their immense size , stars are rather simple objects . A star , no matter how big or how small , lives its life on a high wire , carrying out a delicate balancing act . It generates energy from nuclear reactions in the core . This energy , in the form of heat , exerts a gas pressure that pushes outward while gravity tries to pull the star inward . No matter how big the star , it spends most of its life fusing hydrogen atoms into helium deep down in its core . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb , generates enormous amounts of energy and helps prevent the star from contracting . But eventually the star will run out of its hydrogen fuel reserves . For the star , this is equivalent to a near-death experience . But stars are feisty creatures with a built-in safety mechanism , so they always manage to survive this crisis . When a star runs out of hydrogen , gravity causes the core to contract . The contraction heats the star 's interior , which increases the outward push of gas pressure . This causes the star 's outer envelope to expand and cool : The star becomes a bloated red giant . The contracting core becomes hot enough to begin fusing helium into carbon and oxygen . This round of fusion gives the star a new lease on life . Low-mass stars like the sun end their lives in a whimper . After the core runs out of helium , the core contracts and heats up again . But the temperature never gets hot enough to ignite another round of fusion . The core continues to contract until gravity scrunches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , preventing the core from collapsing any further . The core is a stellar cinder called a white dwarf . A white dwarf , about the size of Earth , is destined to slowly cool and fade for billions of years . Before dying , the bloated star sheds its outer layers of gas , which briefly form a brightly glowing planetary nebula around the white dwarf . Photograph Supernovae spew their debris over the surrounding region of space , leaving behind glowing remnants such as the famous Crab Nebula ( MI ) in Taurus . The iron in our blood , the calcium in our bones , and the oxygen we breathe were forged inside dying stars . Ironically , the death of a star seeds the galaxy with the raw ingredients for the next generation of stars , planets , and life . // Stars that start out with about 11 or more solar masses end their lives in a blaze of glory . When the core runs out of helium , it shrinks . But the massive overlying layers compress the core to a density where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even heavier elements in succession , until the core is made up of iron . At this point , the star 's internal structure resembles an onion : An iron core is surrounded by a layer of silicon , which in turn is surrounded by shells of increasingly lighter elements . Iron is like a stop sign . It has the most stable nucleus of any element - it takes more energy to fuse iron than the reaction gives off . So when the core is made of iron , fusion reactions come to a halt , and the star is ready to meet its doom . When an iron core exceeds the mass of 1.44 suns - the maximum mass of a white dwarf - gravity takes over and initiates a catastrophic collapse . In less than a second , the core shrinks from a sphere about the size of Earth to a sphere the size of a small city , attaining the density of an atomic nucleus . All the protons and electrons in the core squeeze together into neutrons . The resulting stellar cinder is called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains as much mass as the entire human population . This time the neutrons bunch so closely together that they exert their own pressure , which prevents the core from collapsing any further . The core rebounds with 100 billion g 's of acceleration ( an F-16 fighter pilot can withstand about 10 g 's at most ) . This violent action helps trigger a shock wave that rips through the star and tears it to shreds . Photograph Ten years ago , Supernova 1987A graced the skies of the Southern Hemisphere . The explosion occurred 167,000 light-years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud . It was the first supernova visible to the naked eye since 1604 . Despite its dazzling appearance , SN1987A was a somewhat fainter-than-normal supernova . These stellar cataclysms can sometimes briefly outshine an entire galaxy in visible light . Photograph If the supernova is asymmetric , a slight excess of neutrinos flying off in one direction can give a " kick " in the opposite direction to the resulting pulsar or black hole . Astronomers have in fact observed pulsars racing through the galaxy like bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is zooming through the galaxy at 1,000 miles per second . The pulsar is moving so fast that it will easily escape the Milky Way 's gravitational clutch . The pulsar plows through interstellar gas , forming the so-called " Guitar Nebula. " // 1 . The star 's core ( dark blue ) sits in the lower-left corner , 0.3 second before it will explode . The colors represent different gas densities , pressures , and temperatures , all of which decrease the farther they are from the core . The density of material in the inner core is so great that each cubic micrometer of material ( which is much smaller than a bacterium ) has the energy equivalent of a hydrogen bomb . // But things are n't quite that simple . Without an outward pressure emanating from the core , gravity causes the star 's outer envelope  --  previously unaffected by the cataclysmic happenings in the core - to start falling inward . Until recently , astrophysicists who modeled supernova explosions could n't get a star to explode in their computer models because infalling material would ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peter out before breaking out of the core . Because nature has clearly found a way around this problem , getting a star to actually explode inside a computer was one of the biggest unsolved problems in astrophysics . Now if you 're an astrophysicist , subatomic particles called neutrinos come to the rescue . If you 're a star , maybe you 're not so crazy about these little critters . The breakdown of iron in a star 's core produces 10 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion of these massless or virtually massless particles , which stream out of the core at near-light speed . These ghostly particles could pass through half a light-year of lead as if it were n't there , just like a stream of marbles could easily pass through a hula hoop . While each individual neutrino carries only a negligible amount of energy , supercomputer simulations show that their enormous numbers enable them to reenergize the stalled shock wave by heating the material underneath it , similar to how a stove 's hot burner boils water . The influx of energy creates buoyant plumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling it to rip through the entire star and blow it to smithereens . So ultimately , these incredibly ethereal particles are responsible for one of the most cataclysmic events in the universe . The supercomputer simulations on page 47 show how a shock wave forms , is energized by neutrinos , and moves outward through a star . The images come from a group of researchers that includes Adam Burrows of the University of Arizona , John Hayes of the University of Illinois , and Bruce Fryxell of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland . The key to their work , and to other groups that do similar research , is the ability of modern-day supercomputers to model supernovae in two dimensions . Until recently , computer simulations only revealed what was happening in one dimension , essentially a straight line from the star 's core to its surface . These models fell short because they could n't fully account for all the turbulent motions going on deep in a star 's bowels , which power the explosion . For these two-dimensional models , supercomputers must perform 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of about 20 days and perform 1,000 trillion calculations . This gives astrophysicists the resolution required to see processes never before visible . Even with the new computing power , astrophysicists still do n't understand all the details of the turbulent motions inside an exploding star . Burrows 's team and others will ultimately need to model supernovae in three dimensions , necessitating a hundredfold increase in computing power to achieve the same resolution they 're getting now . " Over time we hope to develop knowledge , intuition , and insight into what 's going on by ratcheting up the level of complexity , " says Burrows . " Eventually , our graduate students ' graduate students will be doing this in their classes . " During the few seconds that neutrinos stream out of a collapsing stellar core , more energy is released in the form of neutrinos than the energy radiated in visible light during the same amount of time by the trillions upon trillions of stars in the observable universe . Think about that next time you are out under the stars !
