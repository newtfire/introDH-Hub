The surprise excitement of last week 's Tchaikovsky Competition ( see above ) was supplied by the slight , dark-haired girl who finished second-Philadelphia 's Susan Starr . At 20 one of the youngest of the competitors , Pianist Starr ripped into the Tchaikovsky First Piano Concerto with such dazzling virtuosity that the audience erupted in applause at the end of the first movement , and the orchestra and conductor in at the close . <P> Daughter of a Philadelphia Orchestra violinist , Pianist Starr was pleased but not overwhelmed by her fine showing . " I did n't really want to go to Moscow , " said she to the New York Times , " but the Institute of International Education raised the money for the trip . Of course , a good showing is important toward launching a career , although it 's pretty unlikely that the Van Cliburn experience will ever be repeated . " One annoyance of the competition , Susan found , was " learning a lot of repertory that I would n't otherwise have bothered with . There was a piece composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty tricky , and I may keep it in my fingers for a while . But there were also pieces like the Tchaikovsky Sonata ( in G Major ) that are awfully long for their content . " <P> Moscow , she observed , " is n't as sophisticated a city as , say , Leningrad , and I noticed that people would n't even applaud for a work by Bach . " According to Pianist Starr , the jury distinguished " three distinct ' schools ' of piano playing : American , French and Russian . And the thing that seemed to set the Americans apart was what they called ' overemotionalism . ' " <P> Pianist Starr missed two things while in Russia : a good shampoo and her husband , Pianist Kenneth Amada . " The Russians are a very musical people , " said she , " but they do n't know beans about handling a bouffant hairdo . " Said her husband , to whom she has been married for only three months : " We 've spent much too little time together . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give some two-piano concerts , perhaps we 'll see each other a little more often . "
