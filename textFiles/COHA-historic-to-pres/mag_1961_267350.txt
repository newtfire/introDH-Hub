Whatever else Albania 's Red Boss Enver Hoxha might be , he has proved himself a spunky fellow . Who else would dare walk into the big international Communist powwow in Moscow last November and call Nikita Khrushchev a " revisionist " to his face ? Indeed , Hoxha 's blasphemy went even farther , according to a partial transcript of his speech that reached the outside world last week . <P> <P> " The cult of personality does not apply only to Stalin , " sneered 52-year-old Hoxha ( pronounced Ho-ja ) , as the delegates from 81 worldwide Communist parties sat gaping . " Khrushchev has distorted the theses of Leninism to suit his own purposes ! " Hoxha sided flatly with Red China in the ideological battle to keep Stalinism alive , lashed out at Moscow for organizing the vendetta against Peking at last summer 's Bucharest conference . <P> Hoxha revealed that Moscow had sent a letter to the Albanians asking support for the anti-China campaign . " But even the parties who were asked to condemn the Chinese had no knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Did Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders lack confidence in their own cause when they had recourse to such procedure ? " <P> <P> The Well-Fed Rats . Hoxha revealed that Moscow had tried brutal tactics to force Albania back into line . Last year Albania suffered a near famine . " We had only 15 days ' supply of wheat . After a delay of 45 days , the Soviet Union promised us 10,000 tons instead of 50,000 tons-15 days ' supply of wheat to be delivered in September and October ! " This , declared Hoxha bitterly , was " unbearable pressure . The Soviet rats were able to eat while the Albanian people were dying of hunger ! " <P> More recently , said Hoxha , " Malinovsky Soviet Defense Minister attacked the government and the party during the meeting of the chiefs of staff of the Warsaw Pact , and Grechko Moscow 's commander in chief of Warsaw Pact armies brought pressure to bear on us by threatening to exclude us from the Warsaw Pact . " The Russians also tried to sub- vert Albania 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Politburo , who " capitulated to the dishonest threats of the Soviet Union . " <P> " Pressure from Moscow continues , " raged Hoxha , hinting that Khrushchev had even threatened to throw Albania out of the Communist bloc . " But Albania 's adherence to or exclusion from the socialist camp does not depend on you meaning Khrushchev-but on the peoples of the U.S.S.R. and Albania . " <P> The New Pals . Hoxha 's performance was a devastating revelation of the strains within the Communist bloc , leading some Western experts to suspect that little Albania may by now have been tossed out of the Warsaw Pact and isolated from the rest of Moscow 's family . Recently , five Soviet submarines moved out of the Adriatic and were sighted moving through the English Channel en route to Russia . Western intelligence experts are not yet sure of the significance of the move , but they consider it conceivable that the Russians may have decided to shut down their big sub base and shelters built into the rocky cliffs of Albania 's coast .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
