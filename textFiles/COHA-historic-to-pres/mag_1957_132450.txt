HEROES IN THE CLUTCH // It is the man who delivers in the clutch who wins World Series . Pitcher Burdette was the Series ' outstanding clutch performer , but there were hitters on both sides who came through when needed . The revealing statistics below ( based on 10 or more at bats ) show that these men were not always the club 's leading hitters. &nbsp; &nbsp; // AT BATS // HITS // PCT. // NUMBER OF AT BATS WITH MEN ON BASE // NUMBER OF HITS WITH MEN ON BASE // CLUTCH HITTING PCT. // BRAVES // AARON // 28 // 11 // .393 // 15 // 6 // .400 // MATHEWS // 22 // 5 // .227 // 9 // 3 // .333 // SCHOENDIENST // 18 // 5 // .278 // 7 // 2 // .286 // ADCOCK // 15 // 3 // .200 // 7 // 2 // .286 // LOGAN // 27 // 5 // .185 // 8 // 2 // .250 // COVINGTON // 24 // 5 // .208 // 9 // 2 // .222 // PAFKO // 14 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAZLE // 13 // 2 // .154 // 4 // 0 // .000 // TORRE // 10 // 3 // .300 // 5 // 0 // .000 // CRANDALL // 19 // 4 // .211 // 8 // 0 // .000 // MANTILLA // 10 // 0 // .000 // 4 // 0 // .000 // YANKEES // COLEMAN // 22 // 8 // .364 // 5 // 2 // .400 // MANTLE // 19 // 5 // .263 // 5 // 2 // .400 // LUMPE // 14 // 4 // .286 // 5 // 2 // .400 // BAUER // 31 // 8 // .258 // 9 // 3 // .333 // BERRA // 25 // 8 // .320 // 9 // 3 // .333 // SLAUGHTER // 12 // 3 // .250 // 3 // 1 // .333 // KUBEK // 28 // 8 // .286 // 9 // 2 // .222 // McDOUGALD // 24 // 6 // .250 // 10 // 2 // .200 // HOWARD // 11 // 3 // .273 // 10 // 2 // .200 // SIMPSON // 12 // 1 // .083 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour after the best rock thrower ever to come out of Nitro , West Virginia had intimidated the New York Yankees for the third time in seven days , Casey Stengel was doing his best to forget all about it . Sitting half-undressed in his office under the vast old Stadium and sounding a little as if he expected George Weiss to be hiding under the couch , Stengel talked about next year . // " Now I got to build another team for New York , " he said , " and I 'll build it . I got some pretty good ideas . There 's that Denver farm club , it had a pretty good season . There must be some men there to disturb somebody . " // He shrugged . // " Maybe they can not hit that pitcher we saw today , either , but then maybe he will not live long . " // If this is the premise upon which Stengel hopes to recapture his westerly-flown world championship , it would be wise if Casey should prepare himself for disappointment . That pitcher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right-handed raconteur of renown named Lew Burdette , is singularly well equipped to survive the rigors attendant with becoming a World Series hero . Unlike Stengel 's own Don Larsen , another man who pitched very well one October but failed to remember how he did it when April rolled around , Burdette will probably show up for the 1958 season better than ever . // For one thing , he is a better pitcher than Larsen , a fact frequently overlooked in the past by those citizens so concerned with the function of Burdette 's salivary glands that they forgot he also had a rather remarkable right arm . But perhaps even more important , not the glaring television lights he will face in the next few weeks nor the cramped and unfamiliar stance required to sign some $10,000 worth of endorsements nor even the long winter of adulation and mashed potatoes which await him on the banquet circuit stand much chance of upsetting Lew Burdette 's mountain-grown sang-froid. // From the November day in 1926 when he was born in a West Virginia ghost town until the October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's No. 1 candidate for president of the world , Selva Lewis Burdette Jr . has been much more than just a pitcher . He is , in fact , baseball 's No. 1 paradox . // A big ( 6 feet 2 inches , 190 pounds ) , square-shouldered man with a ruggedly handsome face , close-cropped sandy hair and a strange , floppy walk , Burdette is considered by National League hitters  --  and now the Yankees  --  to be meaner than an acre of snakes . Despite his nervous , fidgety mannerisms on the mound , he works with a vast confidence and determination . That is when he is pitching . When he is not pitching he becomes baseball 's No. 1 screwball . " Burdette , " they say , " is a real squirrel . " // An interviewer capable of getting anything but a wisecrack out of Burdette is a fortunate man indeed . For that matter , his teammates are in the same boat . When Lew and Warren Spahn , the great left-hander who also happens to be one of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwaukee clubhouse . It can also happen in hotel lobbies or on trains or even on the field before a game . Vaudeville would never have died if Spahn and Burdette had been around with their routine of crooked caps , absurd faces , ridiculous pepper games and jockeying antics from the bench . // Burdette 's imitation of a drunk , only one of half a dozen impersonations he practices upon the long-suffering Braves , still brings down the house . But Lew feels cheated since he had to abandon his favorite performance , an almost perfect reproduction of a policeman 's whistle . One night in Chicago he leaned out of a taxicab window , gave a blast  --  and snarled traffic for half an hour . // On the road , Spahn and Burdette room together . " Because we enjoy each other 's humor , " says Spahn . " Because no one else can stand us , " says Burdette. // But the Braves do not really complain . " If that 's what it takes to win ball games , " they say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of baseball 's worst hitters , Burdette was able to look back this summer through six long years to the last time he hit a home run , in 1951 when he was playing with San Francisco in the Coast League . But against Cincinnati on August 13 , he hit not one but two . After the second , Lew puffed back to the bench and announced he was giving up home-run hitting . // " It 's just too dang far , " he said , " around those bases . " // But beneath the clownish exterior on the one hand and the ornery , determined one on the other , Burdette is a man of many and diversified talents . He has driven a taxi , tarred roofs for a construction company , handled a public-relations job and is now vice-president of a real-estate firm in Sarasota , Florida , where for the last two years the Burdettes have made their off-season home . // He is an expert fisherman , a connoisseur of hillbilly and Dixieland music , a home repair man of repute ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigaret lighters , they never work again , " says Mrs. Burdette ) and a singer ( " This is questionable , " says Spahn ) . Also an articulate and poised after-dinner speaker , a crossword-puzzle expert and , in fact , an expert on just about anything . // " If you want to know how much it usually snows in Alaska or what a salamander eats , " says Joe Taylor , the Braves equipment manager , who really does n't care for salamanders but is impressed nonetheless , " just ask Lew . He knows something about everything . " // Burdette is also a deliverer of babies , a talent well hidden until Christmas Day , 1954 , when the Burdettes ' second child , Midge , was born in a police ambulance speeding toward a Milwaukee hospital . // " I 'm in this ambulance with a cop and Mary tells me we 're not going to make it in time , " says Lew . " So I ask the cop , ' What 'll I do ? ' And the cop says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by golly , I did all right . " // TWO NORMAL BURDETTES // The other two Burdette children , Lewis Kent , now 6 , and Mary Lou , now a little over three weeks , arrived in a less spectacular manner , although the baby was born the day after Lew pitched 10 innings in Milwaukee 's pennant-clinching victory over the Cards . // Another thing Burdette may become quite soon is a very wealthy young man . After the longest holdout in the history of Milwaukee , Lew signed last spring for $28,000 . His World Series share will be $9,000 and personal appearances and testimonials could add $20,000 more . Next year his contract will undoubtedly become fatter  --  and next year there will almost certainly be another World Series . // The Braves are a young team and a very good team , a fact suddenly more important than in the past because the Braves themselves also believe it now . They became world champions by surmounting a large number of difficulties , not the least of which was winning their own National League pennant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked up or lacked the spark of greatness is now academic . In the World Series of 1957 they lacked nothing , and the way they beat the Yankees  --  after their best pitcher lost the first game , after being humiliated in the third , after losing the vital sixth by one run  --  was perhaps more important than that they did beat the Yankees . // The man who did most , of course , was Burdette . The defense functioned far better than anyone had expected but the hitters hardly functioned at all . The Braves batted only .209 , a figure which stands unchallenged as quite easily the worst team average a seven-game Series winner ever compiled , and only young Henry Aaron , who is known for that sort of thing , emerged with his prowess at the plate undimmed . Among the pitchers , Bob Buhl , who won 36 regular-season games in two years , could n't come close to winning even one Series game in two starts , and the legendary Spahn , who won and lost in two tries , was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , facing some of the most dangerous hitters in baseball and throwing an object which now goes " yipe ! " when it is bashed with a bat instead of " ugh ! " as in the days of Christy Mathewson , performed a feat unmatched since the great Matty 's three Series shutouts of 1905 . In the first three innings of the second game , the Yankees got to Burdette for two runs . After that , through 24 consecutive innings of tremendous pressure , they did n't score off him once . He beat them 4-2 ( second game ) , 1-0 ( fifth game ) and 5-0 ( seventh game ) . // In recent years only Harry Brecheen of the 1946 Cardinals has won three games in one World Series and the last of those was in relief . Before that , Stan Coveleskie of Cleveland ( 1920 ) started and won three Series games , and any reader who knowingly insists that there is more than slight coincidence between Burdette and this grand old spit-ball pitcher will only be referred back to Mr. Stengel. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while , " says Casey , " but what the heck . If a man beats me three times I am not going to comment on him because he did a good job . " // Whether Burdette actually threw the Yankees any spit balls or not , he certainly showed them an assortment of other things . In the three games Lew threw sliders , sinkers , fast balls , several varieties of plain and ordinary curves and even an occasional screwball , all backed up by a rather awe-inspiring display of control which found him walking only four Yankees , one of those intentionally , in the 27 innings he was at work . // Some of the Yankees , who had been worried most about Spahn , were surprised . Others , like Jerry Coleman , were not . " I knew he could pitch , " said the Yankee second baseman . " I had seen him in the All-Star Game . He 's tough and he keeps everything low and he 's out there to beat you . He won 17 games , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sore arm . You must be pretty good if you do that . " // Said his catcher , Del Crandall : " Lew was n't any better than he has been for the last two years . " // Just the same , as far as Lew Burdette is concerned , it is very nice to receive recognition outside the inner circle of baseball for something besides embroilment in one controversy after another . What the real pros have long known about another real pro , the rest of the world has finally discovered . Here is one very good baseball pitcher . But back in Nitro , West Virginia they are still not sure they believe it . When Lew was a kid he could n't play baseball at all . // Nitro did n't even exist until the last year of World War I. Then it arose from an 1,800-acre cow pasture on the Kanawha River , 11 miles below the state capitol of Charleston , to become a city of 24,000 inhabitants living in 1,724 homes and working in huge factories built in 10 months at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first shipment of powder was also the last . The war ended and Nitro became virtually a ghost town . // By 1924 , however , a few major chemical companies had picked up the abandoned plants , and Lew 's father moved there to take a job which has lasted 33 years . An industrial-league outfielder himself , the elder Burdette used to play catch with little Lew , who was called Froggy in those days " because he could beller like a big old bullfrog . " But Nitro had no high school baseball team , and Lew , who had a try-out , could n't even make the town 's American Legion club . What he could do , though , was throw rocks . // An old friend , Dave Comstock , says Lew was the best and hardest rock-throwing boy Nitro ever had . " One night , " says Dave , " a gang of us were knocking out windows in the Nazarene Church . Lew was half a block behind us , standing in a creek , and hitting those windows as regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nabbed us and put us in jail for a scare , but they never found Lew . He got away , " says Dave Comstock , " because he could throw farther than anybody else . " // " He always could throw a rock like a bullet , " says his mother . " One time he was up on the hill yonder and broke the headlight on our car . He came down and told us about it , though . The boy told the truth , I remember that . " // " He used to go up the hill to a rock quarry after school , when he was about 13 , " says a neighbor , Mrs. Harry Birch , " and throw rocks by the hour . He would pick one target , then another , to improve his aim . " // When Lew was 17 , he had a chance to get a job as messenger boy with American Viscose Corporation , but the company had only two openings and was saving them for ballplayers who could help the plant team . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lew says , " and he told me to try out for the team . ' Tell ' em you 're a pitcher , ' my daddy said . ' They sure need one . ' " // Exactly what impact the future World Series hero made on the Nitro industrial baseball league depends upon who tells the story . Burdette says he pitched four scoreless innings in an exhibition game and got the job . The team manager , a man named Earl Snyder who is now retired , says he was n't impressed . // " He was fast and fairly accurate , " Snyder says , " but he was cocky , too . To come down to it , none of us thought he 'd turn out to be any good as a pitcher . He was n't so extra good at all . That 's not to his discredit , understand . He just had n't played ball before . " // Last week , after watching Lew against the Yankees on TV , Snyder admitted that he was quite surprised by the improvement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if no one else was impressed by Burdette 's potential in those days , a Presbyterian minister , the Rev. Alfred Montgomery , was . He recommended Lew to the University of Richmond and helped him get a scholarship . // He won 10 and lost two and a Braves ' scout took a look at him . Like Mr. Snyder , the scout was n't impressed . But the Yankees were and signed him in the spring of 1947 to a contract with Norfolk of the Piedmont League for a salary of $200 a month . // " I was a real bonus baby , " says Burdette . " They offered me $175 but I told ' em my daddy would n't let me sign unless I got $25 more . " // He moved up on through the Yankee chain , playing at Norfolk and Amsterdam of the Canadian-American League in ' 47 , Quincy of the Three-Eye League in ' 48 and Kansas City in ' 49-50 . After his season at Quincy he met a cute brunette telephone operator named Mary Ann Shelton at a Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two planned to get married after the 1949 season . Instead they got married on June 30. // " I kept going home every chance I got , " Lew says , " so we finally decided we might just as well get married and live on that money I was spending on plane fares and telephone calls . " They were married at Charleston despite an offer from the Kansas City ball club to have the nuptials perpetrated one night at home plate . " Heavens no , " said Mary Ann , and that was that . // Burdette made it to the Yankees at the tail end of the 1950 season , pitched one inning , gave up a run on three hits and the next year found himself back down in the minors at San Francisco . It was then , in late August of 1951 , that Burdette got his biggest break . // The Yankees , battling for a pennant , needed pitching help and they needed it quick . In the devious way of the waiver , they maneuvered around the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a great career , from the Boston Braves for $50,000 and a minor league player . The player was Lew Burdette. // " Some people say he was just a throw-in , " says Milwaukee General Manager John Quinn , " but we really had our eye on him . The Yankees wanted to give us Wally Hood , but our West Coast scout , Johnny Moore , insisted that we get Burdette. " // It appeared for a while as if the Braves had indeed been fleeced . Working in relief against the Cubs at Wrigley Field , Lew bounced his first National League pitch into the dirt three feet in front of home plate , and only unusual agility on the part of his catcher saved the second from going into the stands . " My God , " groaned a Boston writer , " is that what we got for Johnny Sain ? " // " Plain truth of the matter was . " says Burdette now , " I was scared . " // 79 WINS IN FIVE YEARS // He recovered , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1952 and became a starter midway through that first wonderfully hysterical year of 1953 in Milwaukee . In the last five seasons the big man who wears Sain 's old No. 33 has won 15 , 15 , 13 , 19 and 17 games , once led the National League in earned run average and finished runner-up another time . Yet until the second week of October 1957 , it had generally been Burdette 's misfortune to be remembered best for two things : a supposed prejudice against Negro batters , because of alleged bean balls , and a supposed prejudice against all batters , because of alleged spit balls . // " I guess I 'm an old troublemaker , " Lew once told Cleon Walfoort of the Milwaukee Journal . " If I went to church , they 'd say I was into the collection plate . I 'm not really mean up here , but I guess I was in the minors and the boys know I can still get mean . " // Anyway , Burdette is n't worried about what people say any more . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . He may never pitch again as he did on those three October days against the Yankees but , because of them , he will be a better pitcher in all the days from April to September still to come . Even an old hand like Casey Stengel can still learn things from a World Series . // " I learned in this one , " says Casey , " that a pitcher of that type can be very valuable to a ball club . But I do n't figure they want to trade him . "
