When one Hans van Meegeren , a little-known Dutch Nazi painter , owned to forging seven recently " discovered " Vermeers ( TIME , July 30 ) , art experts laughed him off as a nut . They had reason to : the masterpieces had been painstakingly authenticated by them , by chemical , X-ray and infra-red tests . <P> Last week , while awaiting trial in an Amsterdam jail ( for collaboration with the Nazis ) , van Meegeren was under close watch by the art experts themselves , whose own prestige was involved . To their amusement , then to their stupefaction , he was painting another " Vermeer . " <P> The Netherlands Government 's official information service described the scene : " He called for brushes , paints and canvas . - Working with the consummate skill of a master , a painting in the very spirit of the famous 17th-Century artist slowly began to materialize . There can be no doubt that this mad genius did paint the seven pictures attributed to Vermeer . " <P> As a final proof , said the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Museum at Rotterdam shows Christ seated in a chair which was copied from a chair in van Meegeren 's studio . <P> The 56-year-old " mad genius , " slight and nervous looking , who preferred riches ( his forgeries earned him $3,024,000 ) to fame , had avoided detection by meticulous adherence to 17th-Century materials and techniques . Some of his paints were purchased in London , others he made himself , grinding up genuine lapis lazuli for his blues , and cochineal for his reds . <P> Van Meegeren had been suspected of faking as far back as 1937 ( a " Frans Hals , " sold to a U.S. buyer , proved to have been fastened to its stretcher with modern thumbtacks ) . He really hit his stride when the Nazis came in ; he sent the Fhrer a portfolio of reproductions of his work , obsequiously dedicated , and slyly passed off a phony on Goring . From the profits of his " discovered Vermeers " he moved into an Amsterdam mansion .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
