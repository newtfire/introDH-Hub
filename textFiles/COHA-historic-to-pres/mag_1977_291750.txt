The financial and political troubles of former Georgia Banker Bert Lance reached the point last week where Jimmy Carter himself had to come to the rescue . The President recommended that the director of the White House 's Office of Management and Budget be released from a promise that , if kept , could destroy Lance 's already shaky financial position . <P> As first reported by TIME ( May 23 ) , in a story filed by Correspondents Rudolph Rauch and Philip Taubman , the state of Lance 's finances has grown increasingly parlous . But in coming to the aid of a longtime friend , Carter was compelled to compromise the ultralofty ethical standards that he had set for members of his fledgling Administration . <P> Carter 's charitable move must still be endorsed by members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee , which originally confirmed Lance in his job . At week 's end the 17-member group had not reached a decision . But from the tenor of proceedings , there is little doubt that the Senators are strongly inclined to follow Carter 's lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , some observers believe that Lance will still be in trouble because of a number of questionable judgments that he has made since taking office . <P> Undoubtedly , Lance 's debts were the main thing . Last January , before he was confirmed as OMB chief , Lance looked prosperous enough . He filed a statement with the Senate committee listing his " direct liabilities " as $5,343,797 , his assets as $7,968,354 and his net worth as $2,624,557 . <P> The key to Lance 's problem is his ownership of 200,767 shares in the National Bank of Georgia , where he presided before going to OMB . Lance , at <P> Carter 's request , promised the President and the Senate that he would divest himself of his shares in the bank before Dec. 31 . ( Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal made a similar pledge to divest himself of Bendix Corp . stock by Oct. 31 . ) <P> Lance 's shares , bought largely at a premium price , cost him more than $3.3 million in borrowed money . At one point last week their value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep decline was that National Bank of Georgia officers decided earlier this month to write off $2.3 million in loan losses for the first half of 1977 . Another was the prospect of Lance 's promised divestiture . Since his shares amount to roughly 16% of the bank 's stock , the anticipated sale has had an understandably dampening effect on the market value . <P> Making Do . The stock squeeze is not the only drain on Lance 's resources . The genial Georgian , who made $450,000 the year before joining Carter 's Administration but now must make do with his $57,500 Government salary ( plus at least $150,000 in investment-related income ) , pays rent of $15,000 a year for a handsome town house in Georgetown . He owns an elegant 40-room mansion in Atlanta , a $100,000 house in Calhoun , Ga. , and a vacation home on Georgia 's exclusive Sea Island . Nor does Lance stint on entertaining . In June , with his financial position steadily decaying , Lance and his wife LaBelle threw a star-studded party at Washington 's Georgetown Inn for members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger , Publisher Katharine Graham and Mr. and Mrs. Averell Harriman.
