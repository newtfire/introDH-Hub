Unless the unexpected happens , Debi Thomas will become the first black athlete to win a medal in the Winter Games . Records are not immaculately kept on the point , but apparently it was 1980 before U.S. Bobsledders Willie Davenport and Jeff Gadley , along with their Canadian counterpart Bob Wilson , broke the color line . Several more black athletes will compete in Calgary , including Canadian Hockey Player Claude Vilgrain . If part of the problem is lack of black involvement in winter sports , that is changing too . E. Rory Flack , 18 , is the most prominent of a growing number of black athletes following Thomas ' lead . At a Cleveland exhibition last year , Flack was one of some 70 skaters  --  all of them black . " I did n't know there were that many in the world , " she says . " But there are a lot more . They just have n't made it yet . "                    @
