At the turn of the century in California , two men had great dreams . Last week one dream finally came true and the other was an old nightmare in which both dreams fought . <P> The man whose dream came true was 72-year-old Dr. John Lorenzo Dow Roberts , who settled in Monterey 40 years ago . Many of his patients lived along the rugged coastal mountains reached only by difficult trails . Riding through this virgin terrain . Dr. Roberts grew to love its scrawny cypress , bosky gorges , , tall redwoods , dreamed of a scenic highway . Last week after 20 years of battling legislative opponents and tough engineering problems , Dr. Roberts finally saw his highway opened , a 139-mi. oiled string twined around the long fingers of the coastal mountains . The road reaches from arty Carmel-by-the-Sea down to William Randolph Hearst 's huge San Simeon ranch and San Luis Obispo , opens up a whole unspoiled section to motorists . <P> The man whose dream became a nightmare is a far more famed Californian- nimble , thimble-sized John Downey Harvey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chief dandy in the early 1900s . Like Dr. Roberts , he in his day cast his eyes shoreward , conceived a passenger railroad to link San Francisco and Santa Cruz , 80 mi. south . Downey Harvey incorporated Ocean Shore R. R. in 1905 . Big sums were subscribed by prominent San Franciscans and construction soon began at both ends under great engineering difficulties . Then came the 1906 earthquake . Most of the subscribed money was never put up , real estate operators grabbed land . By 1909 at least $7,500,000 had been sunk in the project , and the management was broke . Out forever stepped little Downey Harvey . Trains ran at each end for years , but in 1920 Ocean Shore was officially abandoned , its tracks torn up . <P> Two years later two San Francisco capitalists , Selah Chamberlain and Harry W. Cole , decided to salvage the wreck . Legal squabbles beset the reclamation at once , the biggest coming when the State Highway District claimed the right-of-way to link it into the Carmel-San Simeon Highway . Civic clubs , chambers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wrest the road from Ocean Shore R.R. Last week the battle still raged in court . Meanwhile , Downey Harvey , having lost $5,000,000 and been forced into bankruptcy , never entered business again . Convicted of fraud in 1913 for transferring $100,000 in stock to his wife before bankruptcy , Downey Harvey was cleared by the U. S. Supreme Court in 1916 , has lived ever since on San Francisco 's Russian Hill in complete quiet and extreme popularity among San Franciscans with big hearts and long memories . Still spry at 78 , despite unique infirmities , he snapped last week when asked if he had any " interest " in the current Ocean Shore revival : " I 've lost enough in it already .
