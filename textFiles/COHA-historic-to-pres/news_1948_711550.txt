DIRECT TALKS END West Reserves Right to Take Any Steps to Guard interests AIRLIFT WILL INCREASE Reply to New Kremlin Note Calls Blockade of City Illegal and Coercive By HAROLD CATLENDEB Special to Tax tisw Yoax Tams . PARIS , Sept. ** deadlock between the Soviet Union and the Western powers over rthe control of Berlin will be submitted to the United Nations Security Council , the foreign ministers of the United States , Britain and France decided today . In identical notes delivered tonight , the three Western powers notified the Soviet Union that its " illegal and coercive " blockade Of Berlin rendered further negotiations impossible . The notes accused the Soviet Union of creating " a threat totinternational peace and security . " They said that while the Western powers reserved the right to take " such measures as may be neces= sary to maintain their position in Berlin , " they would refer to the Security Council " the action of the Soviet Government . " The three Foreign Ministers will meet tomorrow to consider the form of this appeal to the Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VII of the Charter , covering threats to the peace . This would mean the parties to the dispute would vote as members of the Council and that the Soviet Union might use its veto . Early Council Action Seen The Council was expected to take up this appeal quickly , but it was said that the Western powers would not press for a rapid decision or for any specific decision .. The action of the Western Foreign Ministers was precipitated by the note received yesterday from Moscow , in which the Kremlin proposed for the first time that the Western powers ' air traffic to and from Berlin be under the control of the Soviet corn ; mander in Germany . Such a proposal had not been mentioned in any of the prolonged negotiations in Moscow . Such a control was regarded as designed to reduce the airlift to the carrying of supplies exclusively for the military garrisons and civilian personnel of the Western Powers in Berlin , and not at all for ' the populace of the Western sectors of the city . It would have intensified the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Thus ended more than six . weeks of negotiations in and with MoScow , which failed to end the blockade . the Western powers ' note of Wednesday failed to break this diplomatic deadlock . Hence the. final note tonight , winding up this fateful chapter in Soviet-Western relations talks on the Berlin issue by passing the dispute to the Secur- ? ity Council . It was noteworthy that in this final note the Western powers , refusing a Soviet woposal to restrict their air rights , specified their intention to continue the airlift . With the use of more C-54 planes , they contend , they will be able supply their sectors of Berlin through even the cloudy , stormy winter months when air traffic will become much more difficult - and much more hazardous than it is now . While these measures are intensified , the- Western powers wilt -- act in the political sphere by lay17 ing their case before the Security ' Council and , through it , . before thek world . This Case in substance la that the Soviet Union has create ' .. a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ? Artiele 2 of the United Nation-a Charter , in which members of the2 organization renounce the use cie force against other members . Leaders of the Western powers- ? do not labor under the illusion that ' the Security Council/or the As= sembly will settle or - even moder= ate-this tussle between the giants , which has now been transferred from remote spots like Korea , Iran and Greece to the center of Europe . This dispute is not carried on indirectly by backing smaller states but directly in a test of strength and influence between the major contenders . This outlook visibly disquieted the French , who are close to the center of Europe and feel their Western Allies have acted too fast and in a way to risk the existence of the United Nations . The Western Allies ' purpose in going before the United Nations is to show that they have neglected none of the resources of conciliation . They felt they could not bypass the United Nations even though an appeal to it might have doubtful practical value . Moreover , they desired to make clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modus vivendi with the Soviet Union . This task of public enlightenment has been delayed by the action of the Western governments in conducting the Moscow negotiations in extreme secrecy on the theory that this might contribute to their success . This secrecy was officially broken only today after the Soviet Union had broadcast its version of the Moscow talks " in violation of the understanding between the four powers , " as the Western Foreign Ministers phrased it in their statement . Thus the policy of secrecy not only failed to insure the success of the negotiations but it once again enabled the Soviet Union , by breaking the agreement , to get its case before the world first  --  as it did last May when it broadcast a secret communication from United States Ambassador Lieut . Gen. W. Bedell Smith . Explaining their decision to go to the Security Council the Western Foreign Ministers said the Soviet note of yesterday was unsatisfactory since it failed to provide assurance that the " illegal " blockade would be ended . The statement then referred to the Soviet demand for control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding currency as evasive . The Western Foreign Ministers ' statement concluded that the Western paw1 ers were " compelled " to appeal to the United Nations because of Soviet insistence upon maintaining the blockade and upon " institution of restrictions on air communications .
