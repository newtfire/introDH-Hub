With creams , unguents , sprays , scented waters , chlorophyll tablets and electronically-treated toilet tissues , the U.S. relentlessly wars on the odors of nature . This preoccupation with the olfactible has made social outcasts of millions who are , in the language of the ads , not dainty , including Li'l Abner 's Moonbeam McSwine . The latest victim is a town-probably at the moment the most deeply disgraced town in the U.S. For , like Moonbeam McSwine , Secaucus , N.J. ( pop . 9,750 people and 75,000 pigs ) has B.O. <P> <P> Do Horses Smell Better ? Secaucus , at the heart of a vast trash-filled marsh known , euphemistically , as the Meadows , is bounded by the ever dirty Hackensack River and two sloughy creeks . Most of its small , bedraggled residential section is huddled on a hill , which rises , like a precarious reef from a mounting sea , above a tide of pigs . The citizens of Secaucus on their hill rarely sniff the full exhalation of the piggeries ; but the town 's neighbors do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail or over the New Jersey Turnpike . For years the authorities have tried to make New Jersey 's Moonbeam a little daintier . Further expansion of pig farming was forbidden in 1948 ( with the result that the pigs became more &; more crowded ) . Reluctant industry was urged to move to Secaucus , and even now plans are under way to build a race track there , possibly on the theory that horses smell better than pigs . <P> Last week New Jersey 's Governor Alfred Driscoll struck a bitter blow at Secaucus . The town , he said , was not a good advertisement for New Jersey-not good at all . The pig farms would have to be cleaned up , " or else . " He knew , he added , that it was quite feasible to raise pigs without " an accompanying stench . " <P> Needed : Chanel . Driscoll drew an angry reply from one Henry Krajewski , 40 , prominent Secaucus pig farmer and candidate for the presidency of the U.S. on the " Poor Man 's Party " ticket ( TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion that pigs could be raised daintily . " Sure , millionaires can do it , " said Krajewski . " Doris Duke did it in Somerville . They tie perfume bottles on the pigs , but the average farmer ca n't afford such luxury . " Furthermore , said Krajewski , it was n't just Secaucus and it was n't just pigs . The industrial areas near the Pulaski Skyway , he said , smell like embalming fluid : " Linden has assorted smells from paint and oil ... There are chemical and acid smells , and Kopper 's coke with its terrible smoke . Out in Manville , there is the asbestos smell . . . And in Newark , you should smell the markets in the morning . No one complains about them ! " <P> Governor Driscoll retorted stiffly : " There is a vast difference between the stink that assails citizens as they cross the Meadows , and the industrial smells that occasionally accompany large-scale operations .
