" It 's only two million . Is that going to be a problem ? " <p> Lexi Titan forced herself to smile . " Not at all , " she lied , wondering if John , her banker , had lost his mind . Two million dollars ? She had to come up with two million dollars in twenty-one days ? Oh , sure . She would just go home and dig around for loose change in her sofa . There had to be a million-dollar bill or two stashed under the cushions . <p> " You could always ask your father , " John said , studying the papers on his desk as if they were the most interesting thing in the world . <p> Lexi smiled . " Thanks so much for the information , " she said as she rose . Ask her father ? Not likely . Even if Jed Titan was willing to bail her out , having to go to him would cause her carefully executed three-year plan to crumble and die . " I 'll get back to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , standing and shaking her hand . " You only have three weeks to come up with the money or you lose everything . " <p> Having the ability to sum up the disaster of her life in a single sentence was quite the gift . She hoped John appreciated it . <p> " I 'll figure it out , " she told her banker . " Talk to you in a few days . " <p> John looked uncomfortable . " Actually I 'll see you tonight , at your sister 's benefit . " <p> Where he would spread the news of her failure far and wide ? " Are bankers like lawyers ? Do you have to keep this sort of thing to yourself ? " <p> " Yes , " he assured her . " There 's a code of ethics . I wo n't say anything . " <p> She hoped he was telling the truth . " Then I 'll see you tonight , " she said , pretending an enthusiasm she did n't feel . She picked up her purse and walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her along the carpeted hallway . She ducked out the nearest exit and found her car in the parking lot . Once inside , it was all she could do not to bang her head against the steering wheel . She could accept that bad things happened . What she hated was when they were her fault . <p> " You got ta be tough if you 're gon na be stupid . " <p> The familiar phrase , spoken in her head by a voice from the past , made her groan . She was in really big trouble and she had no one to blame but herself . <p> Thirty minutes later she 'd left Dallas behind and entered the city limits of Titanville . She ignored the sign that told her to go thirty-five and sped down the divided road . The crap pile that was her life got a little deeper when she heard a siren behind her . <p> Lexi pulled over and lowered her window . She waited until the deputy approached her car , then pulled off her sunglasses and sighed . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough me up a little first ? Then I could sue the department . " <p> " Because it 's a slow week ? " the deputy asked . <p> " I 'm running a little short of cash . " <p> " How much are we talking about ? " <p> " Two million dollars . " <p> Deputy Dana Birch whistled . " I have a new twenty-percent-off coupon from Linens ' N Things in the car , but I do n't think that 's going to cover it . " She glanced at her watch . " Want to talk about it ? My lunch break starts in fifteen minutes . I can meet you at Bronco Billy 's . " <p> Lexi nodded . " That would be great . I 'm going to whine , though . " <p> " I 'm used to it . " Dana sounded cheerful . " Now stop speeding . You know that really pisses me off . " <p> " Okay . Sorry . " <p> Fifteen minutes later Dana slid into the booth across from Lexi . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still quiet . Lexi had spent the time waiting for her friend studying the various Clint Eastwood movie posters on the wall . Bronco Billy 's celebrated all things Clint . His movies played endlessly on TVs scattered around , T-shirts and DVDs could be purchased and the " Do you feel lucky , punk " sundae was a regional favorite . <p> Dana ignored the menu . " What happened ? " she asked . " Someone rip you the wrong way during a bikini wax ? " <p> Lexi pretended she had n't heard the snarky question . Normally she and Dana had a great time sniping at each other about their very different views on female beauty . Lexi owned a luxury day spa and believed in making the best of what a woman had . Dana considered using conditioner on her hair during her daily three-minute shower more than enough girly stuff for anyone . Lexi was n't sure Dana knew what mascara was for . <p> Dana wore her dark hair short , dressed in a uniform while at work and jeans and a T-shirt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they were ten and Lexi had only ever seen her in a dress three times . <p> Dana leaned back in the booth . " Okay , you 're seriously upset . What is it ? " <p> " I was n't kidding about the two million dollars . I need to figure out how to get it in twenty-one days . " <p> " Are you being blackmailed or something ? " <p> That made Lexi smile . " You 're such a cop . No blackmail . Just me being stupid and greedy . " She sighed . " When I left my dad 's company to start my own business , I had that small inheritance from my grandmother . I got Venus Envy up and running but I was barely making it . I had no assets of my own , except my condo . Without the right balance sheet , being a Titan means a whole lot less than people think . Anyway , I was struggling . One day about two years ago , my banker called me . One of his clients was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The terms were simple  --  I would make payments . The guy did n't even want a piece of the business . I used the money to buy the building and completely expand and redo my spa . It was a dream come true . But there was a catch . " <p> " There always is , " Dana said . <p> " The investor 's identity remained a secret and the loan was callable . He could demand full payment with only three weeks ' notice . " She shrugged . " The clock starts now . " <p> Dana swore . " Is it your dad ? This sounds like something Jed would do . " <p> " I do n't know , " Lexi admitted . " I wondered that myself . " Jed Titan was a legendary Texas businessman . Had her father given her the loan only to call it back as a test ? <p> " The reason I want to say no , " Lexi continued , " is that Jed is n't subtle . If he was screwing with me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Then who 's the guy ? " <p> " I have n't a clue . My banker wo n't tell me . " <p> Dana snorted . <p> " What ? " Lexi asked . <p> " Your banker . You have a banker . I know a little ATM machine by the grocery store , but we 've never been more than friends . " <p> " Everyone in business has a banker , " Lexi said , but knew Dana did n't believe her , even though she should . Everyone thought being a Titan meant something . Maybe it did  --  but whatever it meant , it was n't always good . <p> " What are you going to do ? " Dana asked . " Seriously , I 've got five thousand dollars in savings . You can have it , but I do n't think it 's going to help . " <p> " You 're sweet to offer , but no . That 's the irony . Everyone assumes the Titan girls are rich , but we 're not . Well , Skye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just like everyone else . Living from paycheck to paycheck . Jed holds all the family money and he wants each of us to prove ourselves before we get a piece of the family business . That 's what the day spa was about for me . My grand plan to prove I could make it on my own . I 'm not going to lose everything to some faceless jerk . I 'll figure out a way to get the two million . I 'll do anything . I do n't care what . " <p> Dana tapped the badge on her left breast pocket . <p> " Careful there , little lady . You do n't want to break the law . " <p> " If I do , I wo n't tell you about it . " <p> " Fair enough . " <p> The waitress appeared . They ordered burgers and fries , along with Diet Coke , because balance was important . <p> " I hate that I was stupid , " Lexi said when they were alone . " I hate that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , I 'm officially not going to whine for the rest of lunch . What 's going on with you ? " <p> " Your sister is a pain in the ass , " Dana grumbled . " Skye is having one of her fancy parties up at the house tonight to raise money for her foundation and expects me to attend . She knows I loathe that kind of stuff . " She rolled her eyes . " I have a friend who has a foundation . It 's like living in an alternative universe . " <p> " At least you can tell her no , " Lexi reminded her . " I 'll be required to attend . Not that I 'm complaining . Maybe someone will drop a really expensive diamond necklace and I can pawn it . " <p> Dana raised her eyebrows . Lexi 's gaze dropped to the deputy badge again . <p> " Sorry , " she murmured . " You did n't hear me say that . " <p> " Fortunately I do n't believe you 'd do it . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of boring rich guys there . Maybe you can talk one of them into giving you a loan . " <p> " I 'm not sure I 'd want to give them what they would require for that kind of money . " <p> " There is that . " <p> Lexi brightened . " Come with me . It 'll be fun . You can mock everyone . You enjoy that . " <p> " No , thanks , " Dana said . " I have a date . " <p> " With Martin ? " It was all Lexi could do not to roll her eyes . <p> " Why do you say it like that ? " <p> " Because Martin is just like all the guys you date . He 's too nice and you boss him around . " <p> " I do not . " <p> " You do . You find these sweet , unassuming men who adore you and are terrified in equal measure . You completely control the relationship , then complain you 're bored . You need to find someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So speaks the woman who has n't been on a date in six months . You 're not exactly an expert . " <p> " I have a career to think about . A business . " <p> Dana just looked at her . <p> Lexi dropped her head to the table . " That I 'm going to lose in three weeks unless I come up with a miracle . " <p> " Your sister runs a charity . Go ask her for the money . " <p> " She wo n't give it to me . She hordes it for disad-vantaged children . You know Skye . She 's practically a saint . It 's annoying . " <p> " Tell me about it . At the very least , there will be good food tonight . You can bury your sorrows in appetizers with funny names . Just do n't drive drunk . " <p> Lexi straightened . " You so need a man you ca n't push around . " <p> Dana grinned . " There 's no such animal . " <p> " There is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the meantime I need to find a man I can push around . Or a miracle . At this point , I 'd be very happy with a miracle . " <p> Cruz Rodriguez had never believed that cars and women had much in common . He loved cars  --  they were his life . But they could n't keep him warm at night or in the morning . And even brand-new , they never smelled as good as a beautiful woman about to surrender . <p> He climbed out of his silver Bugatti Veyron and tossed the keys to the valet . The kid stood there , staring at his car . <p> " J-jeez . You 're gon na let me drive that ? " <p> Cruz looked at the car . " You going to damage it ? " he asked . <p> " No , sir ! " The kid walked closer , reached out a hand to touch the side , then pulled it back . " It 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . " <p> Cruz grinned , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to stare at the most beautiful thing he 'd ever seen . <p> Lexi Titan stood on the porch of Glory 's Gate , talking to a couple he did n't recognize . Even from this distance he recognized her long blond hair piled on her head , the delicate , classic features of her perfect face . She laughed at something the woman said . The sound carried to him on the warm night air . It was a sound he remembered from a long time ago . <p> He knew all about Lexi  --  statistics were easy to come by and he 'd taken the time to remind himself about her . But he also knew other things . Like the way her skin felt in the shadows and how her breath caught when she could n't help herself . That she hated her real name , and saying it would make her eyes narrow and her hackles rise . He knew pride was both her greatest strength and greatest weakness , that she played to win and unless her back was against the wall , she lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was old money and breeding . He was a guy who 'd fought his way to the top . There were still plenty of social doors that were closed to him . Which was why he was here . He was ready to get those doors open by force if necessary . And whether she knew it or not , Lexi was going to help him . <p> He took the half dozen or so marble stairs up to the front of the house , careful to keep several people between Lexi and himself . He did n't want her to see him just yet . He would determine when and where they met . He would have the advantage . A less confident man might wonder if she 'd forgotten , but he knew she had n't . No woman forgot her first time . <p> Once inside the house , he took a moment to admire the architecture of the structure . It had been built in the 1940s , when land was cheap and a man was judged by the power of his horses , the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twin staircases curved up to a second-story landing the size of an airport runway . The entry glittered with light that reflected on the black and white tiles . A grand piano hugged one of the curved walls because what was an entryway without a grand piano ? <p> Although he 'd never been to Glory 's Gate before , he knew that the twenty-foot-high ceilings were hand carved . He noticed that the seemingly impenetrable walls of the two living rooms and parlor actually rolled away , creating a massive space that easily held five hundred . Now he walked into an elegant room mostly done in gold and sage green , with touches of red . The center parlor had been set up with rows of armless chairs for the auction that was to follow the cocktail hour . <p> He 'd come to be seen , to rub elbows with the Texas elite . To find a way in to their high-class society . A charity auction would allow him to announce his presence with subtlety and class . If he spent money here , he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be accepted . At least that was the plan . <p> He went deeper into the room , ordered a Scotch , neat , from the bar , then looked at the people he knew by reputation alone . He knew the exact moment Lexi entered the room , was aware of her chatting with the guests . As he watched her move toward her sister , he wondered how she was going to react when she saw him . Lexi Titan could give him everything he wanted . There was only one problem  --  ten years might have passed , but he was sure that when she saw him she would be far more interested in killing him than offering help . <br> Continues ...
