N IGHT is falling over the bayou and marsh region of southern Louisiana . Set between sedgy banks or bordered by gigantic live oaks draped with trailing Spanish moss , the inlets lie like motionless mirrors , here and there faintly yellow from the last rays of the sun . Heavy shadows darken the broad expanse of treacherous coastal marshlands . A pirogue slides across the waters to a clapboard shack . A splash of oars pulled in , a thud against the bank , and the occupant of the crude little boat , a rawboned , leather-complexioned man , staggers ashore under a load of pelts . His rubber hip boots make a slushing sound in the mud as he walks to the shack . From its single window a kerosene lamp gleams dully . Casting down his skins , he pulls off his rubber boots with a grunt . He is clad in overalls and work blouse  --  almost like a factory hand . " Not good at h'all , this day , no , " he says to his dumpy wife and two young sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manshac nex ' week . Bot , ' bout cinq minute apres fo ' I cam ' halong side one li'l lagoon , shap ' round Iak pond . . . . " So he describes his day 's experience before setting to work on his pelts . This tiny shack is like thousands scattered through the marsh country ; this man might be almost any one of 30,000 trappers , the workers in Louisiana 's fur empire , mostly descendants of early French and Spanish settlers . Many of them are " Cajuns , " descendants of those Acadians who were deported from Nova Scotia in 1735 , made famous in the " Evangeline " legend and utilized in romantic literature ever since . The millions of grass-covered acres of semi-marsh lands give the state the distinction of being the greatest fur-producing commonwealth in the Union . The value of fur pelts from Louisiana is almost as great as the annual budget of Honduras , greater than the value of all the gold and silver mined each year in Alaska , more than double that of all the fruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pelts than all the rest of the United States , more than Canada and Alaska combined . In an ordinaryyear  --  this year production was halved on account of saltwater flooding and a trappers ' war ? Louisiana sends more than six million pelts , mostly muskrat , to the world market . It is estimated that as many more are bOotlegged , with the connivance of crooked officials , to evade taxes . What does this mean in human terms ? The glamor of the trapper 's life in frozen regions has filled the pages of fiction , and the trappers of Louisiana still lead a pioneer life , with risks as great as those of their comrades in colder regions . Louisiana has no sub-zero weather and no blizzards , though there have been times when the ice did not thaw for a week ; but the trapper and his family are exposed to malaria , typhoid , pernicious anemia , hookworm , tuberculosis , and other dire diseases . And none but the veteran " marsh-walker " can penetrate the fastness of the swamps , bent under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without sinking out of sight in the fluid , often bottomless ooze . The seven million acres of trapping lands stretching brownish gray along the coast contain many spots of terre tremblante to engulf the unwary or even occasionally an experienced trapper trudging along his trap line . By the middle of November the trapper is ready for his arduous work . If he is not working for a company , he has already prepared his " camp , " a crazy shack not much more impressive than the pile of mud and branches built by the muskrats . Though he places it on the driest ground possible , the water often rises and floods through it , forcing the family to live ankle deep in water for days at a time . In the shack 's interior , sometimes papered with pictures cut from popular magazines , are a short-length wood stove , a lamp , barrels for packing , a cot or two , steel traps , and stretchers . The family diet consists chiefly of salt meat , flour , canned meat , and vegetables . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hotter than the hinges of hell , stronger than Arkansas religion . " Red beans and rice complete the bill of fare  --  a rough frontier diet , palatable after dawn-to-dark labor in the marshes . Occasionally instead of building a but the trapper converts a raft into a houseboat for the two and a half or three months of the open season . On the first legal day he gets up before daybreak , dons his rubber hip boots , and sets out with his traps , bent double under a load which most people could not carry across the street , let alone thread the treacherous swamps with . Here and there in the marsh grass bunches of tall reeds thrust up , the rousseau cane , commonly called " rozo , " which serves as a hint to the trapper of the muskrats ' haunts . At convenient intervals in the vicinity of the nests he sets out his steel-jawed " Gibbs " two-trigger or his double-spring " Victor . " On the following morning , again up before dawn , he takes a swig of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is off . " Ha ! zee first rat musque , " he cries . The jaws of the trap are pried open , the animal is extricated , the trap reset . When he reaches home long after dark , he and the whole family skin the animals . A knife slash near the tail , a swift jerk by muscular fingers , and the skin comes off over the head like a nightshirt . The skins are then scraped and stretched on steel frames . This gruelling labor lasts for the seventy-five or ninety days of the open season without a break . In a populous muskrat district boats and huts line the banks as in a Venetian slum . The huts are on stilts ; a few , if the soil is good , have tiny gardens ; perhaps a pig or two roots in a muddy pen . Down the water lane , wherever the output is not controlled by large companies , come the fur buyers in launches , bringing the day 's news from civilization or from other bayous and haggling over the pricing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , the homes of the trappers , are hardly better than the marsh shacks built for a season . Until about five years ago the condition of the trappers steadily improved . For centuries a queer isolated folk , they were being assimilated into the American scene and the machine age  --  as a-result of post-war expansion  --  under favorable economic conditions . More houses were being built in the mainland villages . Many trappers who had never before come out of the marshes were visiting New Orleans and other cities in their own cars . Hygiene , schools , better roads , automobiles , , telephones , and radios were becoming topics of conversation . Suddenly however , the whole picture changed . The inhabitants had trapped and hunted and fished in the coastal marshes for generations , as far back as the seventeenth century , but they had never obtained titles or leases for the trapping lands . When the wealth of the fur industry was discovered , the entire vast region began to fall little by little into the hands of various large landowners , and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was once a public domain , where even privately held portions were freely trapped . Men now trap on shares or for cash rent . Trouble has resulted just as when the cattle companies fenced the Far Western range . Trappers ' wars have broken out . Men have been killed . Some have gone to jail . Trapping means no longer a free and easy roaming life but almost an industrialized existence . In these past half-dozen years a sturdy group of American citizens  --  in the kingdom of the late Huey Long  --  has been driven into peonage . The story of this drastic change is one of chicanery , corrupt officials and judges , strike-breakers , gunmen , battles , murders , jailings . Today three or four big fur companies have a monopoly of most of the land and have createda situation similar to that existing in the soft-coal industry . Most contracts between the companies and the trappers stipulate that the trappers ' half of the yield shall be sold to the landowners . The companies are thus enabled to name their own prices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the market price , sometimes only a third as large . In addition , the fur appraiser divides the muskrat pelts into four classes according to quality  --  the price difference is as great as 80 cents  --  and by generally undergrading pays the trapper on several thousand furs from $100 to $400 less than a just price . On reselling them , the fur company establishes nine categories ; so actually the loss to the trapper is even larger . The monopolization of lands and the importing of outside company men have led not only to hostilities but to a great deal of poaching in season and out . And when this year the fighting and the floods cut the value of the output fully one half , to the lowest point in the past twenty years , Huey Long 's henchmen , some of whom have grown wealthy in these fur companies , pushed through the legislature , with his assistance , a trespassing law so drastic that it is possible to arrest any outsider found in the vicinity of company properties . On streams that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  armed guards trail every boat , and if an outsider puts foot on land he is immediately arrested . The trespassing- law has been made an excuse for the arbitrary arrest of members of the trappers ' union . Most of the fur-company guards are sworn in as state or federal deputies . When the NRA spread its blue wings of hope over the land , several independent fur buyers and independent merchants , who could scarcely operate because of the armed guards , helped the trappers to get a code in Washington . Though the trappers ' representatives were confronted by a brilliant array of company lawyers , they obtained a fairly liberal code , the chief safeguard being that the trappers henceforth were actually to be paid in kind , not in cash at a company-determined Price . It looked as if brighter days were ahead . But the federal " coordinator " did nothing . The same practices continued . We have not been able to find a single instance in which this provision of the NRA code was enforced . The trappers had no money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companies now boycott all local trappers and bring in outsiders , a large percentage of whom are mulattoes , under armed guard . As a result the independent trappers are starving . They try to survive by fishing , shrimping , and oyster hunting during the six months ' open season , but their highest return for such work is 50 cents a day . A recent shipment of oysters by one of the local men brought him 23 cents a sack , from which he had to pay commission , transportation , and refrigerating costs . Many a fisherman finds himself in debt after a week 's arduous labor . A few cut broom straw at $22 a ton . This requires at least two days to cut , then it must be dried and baled . An unexpected rain ruins it . From the sum received , freight and commission charges are deducted . At Shell Beach we found people literally starving . The local stores are all closing or going bankrupt . The imported strike-breakers do not derive much benefit from their betrayal of their fellows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-fifty basis and taken out to the company camps in company boats , but must pay for the transportation from their catch . They have no boats themselves and can not escape if there is a flood . Often they live for weeks ankle deep in water . Last year many families were taken off by fishermen after they had been standing on their beds for three days . The company made no effort to rescue them . Three or four families , men , women , and children , are dumped into flimsy shacks about the size of a small hotel room . For the rent of these shared shacks , each trapper must pay $25 or $30 a season . If a man must have a dugout to get to his traps , he is charged $10 or $12 more . Food is brought out by the company , with 10 per cent added for delivery to already inflated prices . Our inquiries revealed that last season a $4.90 sack of sugar was sold to the trappers for $8 plus 10 per cent . Traps worth $2.75 a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 cents a dozen were sold for $1.80 . The company is supposed to provide water , but often forgets , and the people have to use the brackish bayou water to make coffee . We talked with one company trapper who had brought in the unusual number of 4,000 furs , worth at least $2,000 at last season 's low prices . By the end of the season he was $90 in debt to the company . A wizard of a trapper can not clear $100 a year , whereas he used to be able to make several thousand dollars when he was free . Often the trappers have to wait weeks after the season is over before the company boat comes to take them off , and even longer for an accounting . Such is the vaunted individualism we are asked to protect as a sacred part of American life . When milady puts on her soft fur coat , it is quite possible that it was once stretched out on the side of a shack in the Louisiana marshes by men little better off than the animals they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
