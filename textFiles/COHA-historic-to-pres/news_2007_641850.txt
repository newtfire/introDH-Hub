In December 2005 , Edmonton resident Lilian Hosking turned 101 years old . She was active enough to go for a walk every day , alert enough to watch every Oilers game and mischievous enough to let everyone at the Meadowcroft Senior Residence know she had this thing for Edmonton captain Ryan Smyth and his famous " mullet . " <p> So on the day after Lilian 's birthday , who showed up ? <p> " I carried in this big birthday cake and we sang ' Happy Birthday , " ' Smyth recalled . " Everybody knew about it but her . She blew out the candles and they said , ' Make a wish , ' and she pulled me aside and said , ' The only wish I had was to run my hands through your hair . ' I said , ' Go ahead , ' and she did . " <p> Smyth also presented her with a No. 101 Oilers jersey . His visit with Hosking , who is slowing down a bit now at age 102 , is but one snapshot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet it helps illustrate why it was so wrenching when Edmonton traded him to the New York Islanders last February . When the veteran left wing signed a five-year , $31.2 million contract with the Avalanche in the offseason , it set up a series of potentially emotional reunions . Colorado will play at Edmonton four times this season , first on Oct. 23 . <p> Tonight , Smyth will open his first regular season with the Avalanche against the Dallas Stars at the Pepsi Center , teaming on a line with longtime Colorado captain Joe Sakic , the fellow Western Canadian whose recruiting phone calls helped seal the deal after Smyth became an unrestricted free agent on July 1 . <p> It 's a new chapter for the 31-year-old who got to fulfill his boyhood dreams . <p> As a boy in the resort town of Banff , Alberta , Smyth idolized the Oilers , from Wayne Gretzky on down , and was known to fall asleep in his bed with his skates on . In 1987 , when he was 11 , he served as a stick boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upcoming Canada Cup . At a practice , Glenn Anderson , a one-time University of Denver winger who was one of the Oilers ' stars , offered to let Ryan caddy for him at an afternoon golf tournament . <p> " I 'm thinking , ' This is great ! " ' Smyth said . <p> Tough break for a kid <p> Smyth went to Anderson 's car in the parking lot and , finding that the car was locked , walked behind the car and waited . He was bending over and tying his shoe behind the passenger side when Anderson , running late , jumped in the car , did n't see Smyth and decided Ryan probably was waiting on the other side of the rink . Anderson backed out and hit Smyth , who had heard the key turn and began to scramble . Before Anderson got the car stopped , the tire rubber made enough contact to leave marks on Ryan 's Canada Cup T-shirt , and Smyth suffered a severely twisted ankle . <p> " I 'm bawling and all that , " Smyth said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just take me to the hospital , ' that my mom and dad could come there because our service station was just right across the street from the hospital . . I did n't wash that T-shirt for a few years . " <p> Best of both worlds <p> Jim and Dixie Smyth , his parents , were big in town . They owned that service station , with an accompanying Avis rental car franchise , and when they noticed that their sons - Kevin , Ryan and Jared - were spending so much time on hockey , Jim and a buddy went in together and bought Banff Pizza , based in the rink . <p> " We had to eat somewhere , " Ryan recalled . <p> When they had time , the boys worked , pumping gas and delivering pizza . <p> " I went to school and then I 'd go to hockey practice , " Smyth said . " And after hockey practice , we 'd go up night skiing . It was the best of both worlds for a while . Then my mom and dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or another . " ' <p> Hockey , it was . <p> Ryan left home at age 15 to play for an AA midget team near Moose Jaw , Saskat- <p> chewan , and then - as Kevin had before him - joined major junior 's Moose Jaw Warriors . During his three-season run with the Warriors , Ryan also met his future wife , Stacey . <p> " The big thing to do was drive down Main Street , go into the McDonald 's parking lot , and then come back , " Smyth said . " So that 's what I did . I saw her standing there with some of her girlfriends . She had a Slurpee and I was with my buddies , and I just grabbed her Slurpee and started drinking and then gave it back to her . She was shocked . She had a boyfriend at the time , too , I found out later . " <p> Soon , they were dating , and today , they have two daughters - Isabella and Elizabeth . <p> Even when he was at Moose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game was more gritty than slick . <p> " I was always the get-your- <p> nose-dirty type of guy , " he said . " I knew that going to the net was where it was going to happen . " <p> Face of the franchise <p> When the Oilers drafted him as the sixth overall pick in 1994 , Smyth was elated . After playing for Canada and winning a gold medal in the 1995 World Junior Championships , he became a regular on national teams in the World Cup , Olympics , and World Championships . He won at least one gold medal in all of them , and that and the frequent " C " on his chest at the World Championships earned him a nickname : " Captain Canada . " <p> During the Oilers ' run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006 , he took a puck to the mouth in a game against San Jose , lost three teeth , went to the locker room for stitches - and got an assist on the game-winning goal in overtime . Several weeks later , Edmonton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from being able to add to his championship accomplishments with a hoisting of the Stanley Cup . <p> Still , Smyth had the town by its heart strings . <p> " He was the latter-day face of the franchise , and he was the one Oiler who was going to make it from the start of his career to the end of his career as an Edmonton Oiler , " longtime Edmonton Sun columnist Terry Jones said . " No top player has ever done that . He was an Alberta kid and he represented the blue-collar , **27;2675;TOOLONG mentality of this town . He was real . " <p> Last season , though , his potential unrestricted free agency loomed in the final days before the Feb. 27 trading deadline . The perception was that Smyth had compromised in his previous two contracts with the Oilers , and although he concedes he was more determined to play hardball this time around , the consensus in Edmonton was that at some point , he would re-sign with the Oilers . <p> Oilers general manager Kevin Lowe had gotten the offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agent Don Meehan engaged in a battle of wills . Lowe reacted impetuously on deadline day , and the trade that sent Smyth to the Islanders - a trade he later told the Edmonton media was a mistake - stunned everyone . Smyth shed tears at an emotional post-trade news conference at the Edmonton airport , leading to " Cryin ' Ryan " tabloid headlines . Looking back , with the two sides so close financially , it still seems surprising . <p> " It was about both sides feeling that maybe it was n't right , " he said . " I just wanted to make sure that at the end of the day , I was n't getting short-shafted . I did n't want that so-called ' hometown discount . ' It was n't about money , it was about the way things evolved . They wanted to go a different direction and obviously , I wanted to dig my feet in . " <p> Colorado , here we come <p> The divorce was huge news in Canada - and still is . <p> Smyth was with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then a five-game playoff loss to the Rangers . The Islanders were desperate to make it more than a rental deal , but while Smyth raves about the organization and says he was treated well , he turned his sights back to the west . <p> And the Avalanche called . <p> " Initially , we did n't have Colorado on the radar , " he said . " Why ? I think it was because we were in the same division . . When ( general manager ) Francois Giguere called and was interested , I was , too . " <p> With Smyth on the verge of playing his first regular-season game for Colorado , his new coach , Joel Quenneville , is excited . <p> " Great competitor , great leader , good veteran guy as far as providing regular offense , " Quenneville said . <p> One of his new teammates , defenseman John-Michael Liles , was nervous about greeting Smyth , given that Liles was involved in a controversial kneeing incident with Smyth early last season . <p> " I did n't bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was the second day , " Liles said . " I think he knows it was n't intentional . " <p> Liles laughed and added , " I 'm not going to lie to you . I 'm glad he 's on my team this year . . He 's been great on the ice and in the locker room and he 's kind of cut from the same mold as Joe ( Sakic ) , where he 's leading on the ice and off the ice . " <p> That 's what the Avs are counting on .
