We have lately had numerous examples of female ingenuity . We have been told how an innocent clock iu the hands of a lady was made to act the part of a tell-tale in the Tilton household . Then there was that case of the black burglar in the parlor closet . A woman was the sole occupant of the house when lie entered . She knew of his presence , but instead of giving au alarm , which might make him desperate , she took an empty bottle , walked with a steady step to the closet-door , ordered the burglar out , and sent him to a neighboring apothecary for a dose of medicine . The plan of the wife who persuaded herself that the midnight burglar was none other than her own " good-for-nothing brute of a husband , " returning home from a beer-drinking bout , may not be considered so original as the foregoing , although certainly much more laughable . The burglar was moving softly up the stairs , and had gained the second landing , when the indignant wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly downward , pounced upon him from out of the darkness , and taking his neck between her hands never let him pause for an instant to take breath until she had pushed him from the stoop head-foremost into the street . But all these are as nothing compared with the ingenuity which has just been displayed by a simple country maiden residing at or near the town of Pulaski , in this State . From time immemorial , it has been a puzzle to the fair sex how best to prevent fickle gallants from wandering about in search of new conquests , after they have confessed their love and engapdthemsclves to marry . We remember having read somewhere of a Kentucky girl who threatened that she would make an end of her life if her lover should prove false , but this did not prevent him from marrying somebody else . Luckily the girl did not carry out her threat . She took another way of " getting even . " She went into a belt of wood which bordered qn the road over which the false lover and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having calmly awaited their approach , sent a bullet through the heart of the horse which was speeding along with its happy load . The remainder of the journey must have been performed on foot but for the generosity of the jilted fair one , who , having satisfied her revengeful feelings , made amends by harnessing a team to her own wagon and driving the newly-married pair to their destination . The plan of the Oswego County girl is better still . The name of this interesting young person is SOPHIA . BAKER . although it is but right to say that she discards the i in SOPHIA , and in her matter of fact way calls herself SOMA . It appears that in the course of human events Miss SOPHA made the acquaintance of one HENRY SMITH . Their intimacy ripened into mutual affection , and finally culminated in an engagement to be married . After this state of affairs had existed fur a year . Miss SoPriA evidently became suspicious of her HENRY . She probably thought that the other young girls of the neighborhood , jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her , and that there was need fur prompt action . She wrote the following advertisement , and had it published in one of the most widely-circulated papers deleted 8 lines vals , she goes deliberately to the office of her family journal , and , like a sensible girl that she is , puts herself on record as having a firstmortgage on the affections of HENRY SMITH , and warns all the world that if he should attempt to negotiate a second , she will immediately foreclose . If , hereafter , some designing young person should alienate HENRY 'S affections from his true love , she will do so under a full apprehension of the consequences ; while , on the other hand , HENRY , having been forewarned that " he will hafto suffer the pently of the law , " in the event of a failure to keep his promise to Miss SOPHA , should the case come before a jury , will not have a shadow of a defense to offer . The simplicity of Miss SOPHA 's plan will commend it very strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall not be surprised to see her example followed to the extent of half a column of notices in each of the several weekly papers published throughout the country .
