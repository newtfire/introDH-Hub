As President Truman had directed , Attorney General Tom Clark last week issued his list of " totalitarian , fascist , Communist or subversive " organizations . It is to be used as a guide for the President 's Loyalty Review Board in judging the loyalty of federal employees . <P> Clark 's black list of 90 organizations , compiled from the files of the FBI and other Government bureaus , contained no surprises to newsmen and others who cover the Communist front . Under the Communist Party , it listed seven " affiliate " committees , among them the Labor Research Association Inc. and the Committee to Aid the Fighting South . It listed several disbanded outfits , but it did not include several large organizations whose leaders ' pursuit of the Communist line has made them suspect in Congress and elsewhere. * Now labeled by the Government as " Communist or subversive " were these busy and noisy organizations : <P> The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship , chairmaned by the Rev. William Howard Melish of Brooklyn 's Holy Trinity Protestant Episcopal Church . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall ( no kin to the Secretary of State ) . It has been the courtroom defender of avowed Communists . <P> The Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee , chairmaned by Dr. Edward K. Barsky , now out on bail pending appeal of his conviction for contempt of Congress . <P> The Council on African Affairs . <P> The Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade . <P> " Up-to-Date as a Model T. " Also listed were the American Youth for Democracy ( once the Young Communist League ) and eleven schools which Tom Clark 's sleuths decided were Communist Party incubators . From William Z. Foster , boss Communist in the U.S. , came the expected cry : " A purge list . . . takes the United States a long way toward fascism and police-state totalitarianism . " <P> The list found few friends anywhere . Its incompleteness was " utterly farcical " to New Jersey 's Congressman J. Parnell Thomas and to most of the members of his Un-American Activities Committee . Said Thomas : " There are hundreds of Communist and Communist-front organizations alone . " Said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford . " <P> " Guilt by Association . " Tom Clark prefaced his cautious listing with a warning : " It is entirely possible that many persons belonging to such organizations may be loyal to the United States . Guilt by association has never been one of the principles of American jurisprudence . " Editorialized the New York Times : " Guilt by association is certainly implied . . . . The Government will be on safer ground , well within the principles of the Bill of Rights , if it gives every organization . . . a public day in court . " <P>
