VAIL , Colo. - For a long while the folks in Stowe , Vt. , suspected that little Lyndall Heyer was either backward or a radical because she didn ' t fling herself off such local landmarks as Mt . Mansfield and Spruce Peak . As a child eccentric who avoided the usual playgrounds - ski trails called the National and the Starr - she seemed like a Tahitian refusing to swim or an eskimo declining to fish . She preferred studying to skiing , and even her teddy bears regarded her as abnormal , maybe even subversive . Her explanation for failing to join the Green Mountains rat race on elongated pointy feet : " I didn ' t have pushy parents . " But that was more than a decade ago . Eventually , Lyndall Heyer was a belated beginner - " I started skiing seriously at 12 , really late for Stowe " - and soon nobody thought her a case of arrested development . She was thrice national junior champion , did time as a member of the US ski team , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been prouder six days ago if they had witnessed Heyer busting down Vail Mountain , neck and neck with a powerful Frenchwoman - and then swooshing ahead to win the last giant slalom of the season . But others still might have considered her a radical , since Lyndall was doing it for money - $2940 , to be exact - as one of the pioneers on the women ' s pro ski racing tour . Professional ski racing for women may or may not rank higher than hat- checking on the occupational scale , but it doesn ' t get as much attention , approval or subsidization as its ( so-called ) amateur counterpart . The pro tour has completed its third winter , and none of the inmates claims to have made nearly as much money as Olympians Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein , Anne-Marie Moser-Proell of Austria or Cindy Nelson of the USA . But they are no longer kept women either , and Heyer grins , " It ' s great to be on your own . After a certain age , the team experience gets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As pros , " Lyndall says , glowing from the day ' s sun and triumph , " we ' re independent . On our own . It ' s a great feeling . " She sounds like Billie Jean King a dozen years ago , in the first days of female professionalism , when that game ' s amateurs were better known and compensated than the honest working women . " When I think of what ' s happened to tennis , " Heyer says , " I really have hope for us . No comparison now , of course . Not yet . No $100,000 prizes like Tracy Austin ' s been winning , but they had to start low , and so have we . " Indeed , her $2940 payday for the last giant slalom would have seemed opulent in the formative stages of female pro tennis . Somehow it all looks harder for the skiers . Their long-way-baby is a series of limb-risking charges down mountainsides at speeds as high as 70 mph , and winning an event could mean competing in as many as nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously this is a very tough sport for spectators , too , who must climb and shiver in the snow to be part of a standing audience . Heated arenas have greater appeal . " But , " says Jill Wing , a shrewd , tough young woman who is the mother superior of the ski tour , " we ' re showing progress . When we began in 1978 the tour had three races worth a total of $40,000 . The next year , four for $55,000 , and this year the circuit had seven stops worth $165,000 . Next year it ' ll be nine and $225,000 . " Wing , a 29-year-old ex-skier with fine features , long brown hair , and apparent organizational acumen , put the tour together , and calls the plays . She issues invitations , limits the field to 40 and - unlike tennis - will accept no bassinet refugees . " I don ' t believe anybody under 18 should be a professional , and so that ' s the minimum age . " The course on Vail ' s Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blue banners ) is extremely steep at the end of its 560- yard route . With a great burst of energy at the bottom , 23-year-old Lyndall Heyer pumps madly past Jocelyn Perillat to the most lucrative victory of her career . However , the second place for Perillat , a native of the French Alps , earns her enough points to secure the 1980 tour leadership . She had trailed Norwegian Toril Forland , the 1979 leader , but edges past in total points since Forland had torn up a knee the day before . But Heyer , on the strength of this giant slalom , closes out as the top American at No. 3 in the standings and has earned $15,932 in prize money . She says she also makes approximately that amount in endorsements , lovingly tapping the trade names on her skis , poles and everything covering her body . " Before I turned pro I was on a ski scholarship at Utah , but now I ' m paying my way through Vermont . I ' m a junior in forestry , " Lyndall says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She is lively , healthy , attractive , but beneath it all , she laughs , " I ' m a mass of bruises . " An aggressive skier , she nips the gates as tightly as possible . " People don ' t realize what a beating you can take from skinny bamboo poles when you brush them at high speed . " Heyer feels that as money and publicity increase more top-fight women will desert amateurism to work out their sporting destinies in a new profession . " I never felt so great about my sport , " says the former backward child . " And you know what else we have that I never encountered as an amateur ? " Our tour , " she beams , " has male groupies !
