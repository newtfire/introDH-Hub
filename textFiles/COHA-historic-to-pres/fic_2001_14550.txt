Scene Steam : A party in a hypothetical Newport , Rhode Island ; late summer ; only something has gone wrong , radically wrong , during the taking of the annual family photograph ; present are The Marplot ( Uncle FRASER ) , Aunt BIANCA and Cousin JULIA ( the Eraser ) , MOTH and LOUISA , ( the one they call The Ninny ) ; and two MUSICIANS . And a very frustrated PHOTOGRAPHER , standing next to an enormous silver-plate camera . Everyone is gossiping ( at the same time ) animatedly about everyone else ; there is a lot of bad jazz . Abruptly the bad jazz stops . The Photographer in horror Cousin Julia the Eraser . HORN GIRL They do n't call her The Grande Parade for nothing . Bad jazz starts up once more . COUSIN JULIA Whited sepulchers . Whited hypocrites and creatures of the blench . Blenched and two-faced , the whole bloody lot. * We get together once a blue moon , once a decade , once a century , once a millennium , and you see the incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A picture of the most appalling kind . A model of indecorous outrage and unhinged incivility . Injured merit run amuck.Observe the Marplot there . Fraser is so filled with swarthy venom he must disrupt this , this most innocent of occasions.Can he hear me ? No , of course not . Too wrapped up in his own foul rancor , a whirlwind of a man . A local disturbance posing as one of us . A hypothetical human . p. 3 AUNT BIANCA And I was doing nothing harmful ; and I was doing nothing of the kind ; and I was merely minding my own business when the two of them , yes , the two of them swept down upon me like the spider ; yes , very much the spider . She makes the spider . The two of them , with their eight legs arranged just so . The two of them , yes creeping sideways in her idea of spidery motion , her long red tongue lolling . She stops ; looks over her shoulder to see if FRASER is noticing her ; he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRASER OUTERMOST RING Can you believe it ? * I am surrounded by maniacs and idiots . It is hard to say which is worse , the maniacs or the idiots . It is hard to say which is worse , the mania of the maniacs , or the idiocy of the idiots . For if there is one thing I can not abide it is the mania of maniacs ; for if there is something I hate even more than that it is the idiocy of idiots . And the worst He rages silently.And the worst is the idiocy of bad jazz , and the noise of these infernal idiots and maniacs , idiots and maniacs as you see arrayed all about me . Me ! Arrayed all about in a way that I find Arranged in obsequious propinquity . Arranged in a way cunningly contrived to inflict the maximal insult upon the auditory person of my personhood . He dances a jig of insult . Reprise . p. 4 MOTH I am the only soft one ; I am the only soft one , even though I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am the only soft one ; I am the only soft one , because I am covered with feathers . Yes , with feathers . Not with fur.Yes.Yes . The others are not covered with feathers.Yes . With fur , look at them . Fur.Yes . And I should have stayed home.Yes , I should have stayed , and rested quietly behind the floral screen , in my very own room.Yes , behind the floral screen , where I love to sit in the darkness reading the geometrical writings of Isaac Ring Barlow , our ancestor . Yes and yes , I should have stayed at home , behind the floral screen , in my own little room , eating a prickled bloatfish , there , in suburban Kama-Loka , where I grew up . Curious . She smiles and shows her good teeth . COUSIN JULIA When we were young , we girls sang a song about Fraser . I shall sing it now : CuriousCurious is the man Curious the man who has time to fiddlehack upon a canbut not to riddlethe heart of man , nor his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy or girl ; whether top or swirlingcuriosity.O black black blackhearted curiosity . Reprise by all the WOMEN p. 5 LOUISA Er , Poor MOTH faints in horror.All this is my fault , I suppose , and , er It is true that I am a ninny though my name is not that , er It is Louisa ; but I am called " Ninny " because as a child , I visited with some distant relatives , strange white people from the deep , interior regions of Rhode Island 's vast wasteland and was told many wondrous things , er well , I suppose it comes down to that : I told my parents how how impressed I was by those strange people , not to mention their whiteness which was of an extraordinary kind ; All stop to hear what she is about to confess:and , well , I said to them , my parents , I mean , er I want to be one of them when I grown up . All turn slowly to regard her with cold condescension . Pause . All look away.So , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a real big disappointment . The Marplot breaks out of the freeze and begins a confidential talk to some of the members of the audience . FRASER OUTERMOST RING Can you believe it ? Can you ? Well , I ca n't . Because actually it is quite beyond whatever we mean when we call something " unbelievable " . Such a pretty girl , and so stupid . Yes , so profoundly stupid that her stupidity possesses a pallor that is almost He considers the question of what might constitute an apt comparison. that is almost godly ; in other words , a whiteness that simply beggars description . And all this must be the outcome of some genetic predisposition or some ancient curse laid upon our tribe by A glimmer of insight.Who knows ? By some other tribe of equally ancient , but heathenish morons A more substantial glimmer.I am referring to those ancient and heathenish ones who occupied the place even before us . A pause for reflection.If indeed the place could be said to have been occupied at that remote time , because it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly be thought of as a place , place qua place.A place actual , that is.No , for in our absence a place can not be said to constitute a place , only an emptiness.A noplace.A primeval wasteland , devoid He illustrates what it is he is attempting to convey with a motion of hand and arm . Pause . He does this again , it was so much fun ; However ; clearly such gestures are not The Marplot 's long suit , and so he gives it up . Seeing him apparently conclude his remarks , the MUSICIANS start up their machines again , and we hear more Bad Jazz.Stop stop stop* that hideous din . p. 6 COUSIN JULIA Oh Fraser , do put a lid on it , will you ? She steps forth , imperiously ; a magnificent specimen . LOUISA in particular is impressed by her aristocratic bearing : LOUISA This is a cousin  --  not of the moron variety  --  but of another , equally drastic : Cousin Julia , Cousin Julia , called The Eraser because her visits tend to be accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared by the rest of the family ; er , Cousin Julia has just returned from a trip to Jerusalem , where she has become a a jewel . FRASER OUTERMOST RING A monstrous carbuncle , one might say . COUSIN JULIA Just who am I ? you ask and since you pose that question I shall give you a fit reply . I am The Grand Parade , and that is the whole of it . That is also why I am universally feared and respected.Yes , I am she who guarantees when a way is found that it be the right way because what good would a way possibly be if it were not the correct way ? The splendor of my being shall illuminate all these matters until the time comes . LOUISA Er , COUSIN JULIA Please do not interrupt.Yes , my dear , The Grand Parade must run , run and run her course till what has been implied has taken on manifestation , a local habitation , and born the shame of such . p. 7 LOUISA No , I was merely going to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has begun snowing . Even though it is still September . A pregnant pause , as it has indeed begun to snow . We hear , very quietly , the Siegfried Idyll ; Or is the music emanating from some far stranger , metaphysical domain ? All are deeply concerned about this question , but none of them wishes anyone else to be aware of his or her concern . An Aryan pause . FRASER OUTERMOST RING It is snowing , of course . What of it ? AUNT BIANCA May I go back to the cupboard now ? COUSIN JULIA Yes , Lady Blank , you may go back to your damnable cupboard . Only see that you behave . AUNT BIANCA Only the tiniest peek , I promise . COUSIN JULIA Only the tiniest . Scene begins to fade out strangely . MOTH And so , at the turn of the century , we all assembled in this place , to greet the new century , and yes , the new millennium , yes , only somehow we got it dreadfully wrong . COUSIN JULIA Radically wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from them . All turn to him . An accusatory silence . From depths of his remoteness : p. 8 FRASER OUTERMOST RING Yes , yes . I know what you are thinking . You are thinking it is Uncle Fraser 's fault.It is a problem I have with the black art , yes , the black art of photography . And that problem revolves with a regular orbicularity about an unassailable truth : namely , that the photographer 's devilish craft involves the complete effacement and wiping out of the human soul . This process can be gradual or instantaneous , depending on the relative thickness or thinness of the spiritual entity in question . He casts a significant glance at The Ninny , who looks down abashedly.I of course have suspected this all my life , but did not arrive at a finished conclusion until I had secured my fortune , and by implication the fortune of the entire clan , with that old enterprise in the depths of the depths of the Telegu Archipelago . All the WOMEN do something strange.Yes , yes . You scoff at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we signed documents with the presiding fugleman in Frontenac Bay , all went according to our whitened way . A pale-faced pause.Deep , deep truths I learned from my hetman there , Baga and his catchild , Squeech . Deep , deep things . A strange , slow and dark music breaks out.At the rituals we we participated in , as full equals , I might add . As BAGA:WHATAMDISFER ? WHATAMDEMFER ? WHATEMDOSFER ? WHATAMYAMFER ? Or , more correctly : WHAT AM DIS FOR ? Holy holy holy.WHAT AM DEM FOR ? Lordy lordy lordy.WHAT AM DOS FOR ? Allalu , allalu , allalu.WHAT AM YAM FOR ? Blory , blory , blory . The MUSICIANS take up the chant , quietly.And , thus , even among the indigenous dwellers of that remote region , the central questions revolve just as they do for us ; with , one might say , as equal and perfect an orbicularity : Who am I ? What am I here for ? Who are they ? What are they here for ? Music ends.Baga and his catchild , Squeech . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiting out of the oft photographed human soul . p. 9 COUSIN JULIA All this feels rather arcane and superfluous , Fraser , given the difficulty of assembling the family . All at one time . All at any one place , that is . FRASER OUTERMOST RING I am resolved in my decision . COUSIN JULIA You have marred the occasion . FRASER OUTERMOST RING The occasion be damned . The PHOTOGRAPHER , who has been standing idly by , rages and chews on the brim of his hat . COUSIN JULIA The camera is prepared ; the photographer has been standing idly by ; we shall be forced to proceed without you . FRASER OUTERMOST RING I , the photographer be damned . LOUISA Er , Another white pause . Aunt BIANCA abruptly sits down . Cousin JULIA signals to the MUSICIANS . COUSIN JULIA Aunt Blank , will you lead us in a few verses of the originary document ? Aunt BIANCA brightens , gets up . AUNT BIANCA The family hymn ? COUSIN JULIA Yes , my dear . That will do . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be all day long , despite the black mood of Kaiser Fraser here . The MUSICIANS do their best as BIANCA begins , uncertainly : Mine eyes have seen the something of the coming of the Lord ; he is something something something with his terrible swift sword The song dissipates as it becomes apparent that neither BIANCA nor the MUSICIANS know what they are Doing . The scene piffles out . All leave except The Marplot and The Ninny . p. 10 FRASER OUTERMOST RING Have they all gone ? LOUISA Not quite . And in fact : JULIA and BIANCA are intently observing from just offstage , in the audience . Elsewhere , MOTH observes both the observers and observed , herself unseen . FRASER OUTERMOST RING They have ruined me , Louisa , with their wicked wicked obsession with establishing a visual record of all events , even the most seeming innocent . LOUISA I do n't know what to say . AUNT BIANCA What are they saying ? COUSIN JULIA How can I hear if you 're always yapping ? AUNT BIANCA I think* they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of partial erasure . FRASER OUTERMOST RING Well , they know what to say , Louisa . And what they are saying they are saying about you and me ; some of it about you and the greater part no doubt about me , and all of it revolting . LOUISA They mean well enough , Uncle Fraser . They ca n't help being who they are , vague and insubstantial . Fraught with the intangible . These qualities go with the terrain of their awful whiteness . MOTH I think all of this is very silly . I think all of this is so very silly , so silly I am going to tell you all a little story about the olden days when the vast metropolis of Newport had not been dreamt of . Long before our ancestors had discovered the principle , long hidden , of certain , wonderful flea circuses far away in the Telegu Islands , and came shortly thereafter to corner the market here . Long before Fraser , who was just a young boy ( I think it was this Fraser ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flinty dislike of all things associated with mechanical flea circuses and other miniature , wind-up automata . A profound hatred of all miniatures , be they natural , or artificial.Long before Grandfather Lockhart stood up during a performance of the Ninth Symphony at the Crystal Pavilion and took the bullet meant for Governor Gormley , a big , bald , whitish sort of man , and was declared a hero in his abrupt deconstruction. p. 11 LOUISA She 's talking about imaginary things again , Uncle Fraser . Decompression . Shadow dances on the Neman River in old Byelorussia . White Russia . Lovemaking under a pontoon bridge on Decoration Day . FRASER OUTERMOST RING She has changed into one of them . LOUISA What ? FRASER OUTERMOST RING A lepidopteran . MOTH Long before that , indeed . Long before Cousin Julia the Eraser erased the last two letters from my good maternal appelative and spat them out at poor little infant Louisa Outermost LOUISA Er , FRASER OUTERMOST RING What is it ? LOUISA Er . I said " Er " . FRASER OUTERMOST RING Be quiet then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before my own Great Uncle , Tom Blank , exhibited his device at the World 's Fair in Providence , the Rhode Island White-tailed Dioptrical Silver Plate , in whose shimmer shimmer even the Negro and his Negress might take in the radiant whiteness of his and her eternal Christian soul . COUSIN JULIA What are they talking about now ? p. 12 AUNT BIANCA Something about going to the cemetery . Putting up a monument to the Bishop He wrote books , I think . COUSIN JULIA Who wrote books ? AUNT BIANCA The Bishop . He collected things too . They tell me he was a bug man . COUSIN JULIA What ? AUNT BIANCA He had these pieces of cork with needles in them , and he catches bugs and sticks them on . We do n't understand these things but it 's true , just the same . Can I go to the kitchen and look at the Chiffonnier ? Something strange happens . All stop whatever they are doing ; and missing a beat , try to figure out , privately , what has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . COUSIN JULIA What did you say ? AUNT BIANCA I forget , something about wanting to go back to the kitchen . COUSIN JULIA And just what would you be up to , if you should do that ? AUNT BIANCA Well ah COUSIN JULIA Yes . AUNT BIANCA Well , since Lady Moth seems to be preoccupied with a fit of fantastical reminiscence , I shall maybe , at any rate , I might ah p. 13 COUSIN JULIA Yes . I think I know . AUNT BIANCA If you think you know , why do you ask me ? COUSIN JULIA I am hoping , dear Bianca , that I have misjudged your intentions . AUNT BIANCA Well , I thought with all these temporarious disturbances , what with everyone acting like the white mouse trapped within the tikum-tokum of an originary Diophantine Challenge Box The original model came only in alabaster and Mother of Pearl . Even the brilliant porches of Newport were not so brilliant , but dear me I have quite lost the thread of my idea . COUSIN JULIA That is because you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIA Yes you were . AUNT BIANCA Funny , I was not aware of being evasive . COUSIN JULIA That is not a justification . AUNT BIANCA Do you think my lost thread of thought requires a justification ? COUSIN JULIA There is a justification , or the implication of one floating about in the fluid suspension of your consciousness , my dear . Just asking to be rubbed out . p. 14 AUNT BIANCA My word , Julia . You make it sound like we are bobbing for apples . COUSIN JULIA  --  AUNT BIANCA  --  The MUSICIANS mutter in their corner , their hushed voices , strange , barely human . They sound like rodents . MUSICIAN ONE They call him The Marplot because he 's a grump . MUSICIAN TWO They call him something like that , I suppose . MUSICIAN ONE He hates us . He hates the music we make . MUSICIAN TWO He is rich . And large , and white . He can get angry at whomever he will . MUSICIAN ONE He hates us because he is one of us . MUSICIAN TWO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninny niece of his are making faces at us . Indeed , they are . Quite ugly faces . MUSICIAN ONE He is a hateful grump . And a grouch . MUSICIAN TWO What is a grouch ? MUSICIAN ONE Similar to the grump , but worse . Worse as rat is to mouse . MUSICIAN TWO Worse . MUSICIAN ONE Yes , much worse . Ruminative pause . MUSICIAN ONE scratches his hump ( he has a hump ) . Then why have we been hired to play music here ? p. 15 MUSICIAN TWO His wicked cousin , the one they call The Grand Parade has arranged the whole business . My surmise is that , in a previous life , he was an inventor of music boxes and mechanical flea circuses himself but I can not be entirely sure FRASER OUTERMOST RING What are you saying , my good man ? What idiotic calumny are you giving voice to ? You have laid siege to my wits with this expensive , idiotic noise . COUSIN JULIA Music , it is called , Fraser . Please desist from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been commissioned . FRASER OUTERMOST RING Noise , noise , noise . The MUSICIANS start up in a fury . He dances his angry jig.Expensive noise then . A stench in the ear . The two MUSICIANS sing:Description is the beggarrolling up the floorcutting up the carpetupon which the Devil poured bleach of his depiction.whirling like a djinn , pure description beggaredWhite as sin . White as sin ; white as sin ; white as description beggaredwhirling like a djinnwhirling like a djinn.White as sin ; white as sin . Reprise . All begin to whirl , their white clothes like monstrous blooms rotating around them.They sing : In the white squallof the metaphysical ocean.Ocean , ocean , ocean . White as sin ; white as sin ; white as description beggared.Whirling like a djinn.White as sinwhite as sin Music stops suddenly  --  as a mean and petty practical joke of the two MUSICIANS . They hide a cackle . All the others look somewhat embarrassed . In this awkward moment , MOTH chooses to start up her story again : p. 16 MOTH and long before that ; and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Founder 's Day and before , yes , even before the signing of the originary document and the preliminary description ; and before even the first voyage of our brave ancestor to the Isthmus of Telegu and the station at Whydah , along the bleached , bone-white sands of Dahomey ; and before the invention of the Rhode Island Silver Plate Dioptrical Flea Circus , and all the various types of music box : those of ivory and those of horn ; those of the right , and those of the left brain ; those of the angel who is the wandering &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; albatross , and those of the imp Obsidian &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whose weight forces the fulcrum up , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; whose weight forces the fulcrum down ; and before even the naming of names ; of Leucoblast and Leucorrhea ; of Leucocyte and Leucocytosis ; of Leucoderma and Saint Leukemia ; of all things so turned and so leprous they outwhite oblivion ; for Softly ; all the WOMEN join in the song , as this is a ritual from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light comes in.In every town , there is a white girl ; whiter than the rest , whiterthan snow , whiterthan corn tassel , whiter thanwheat flowing in the evening breeze ; whiter than the air we breathe ; A fluffy white silencio.Whiteness is the color of whatwant is . Whiteness is want ; what we all want , not knowing . A choral reprise.In every town , there is a white girlwhiter thanthe rest ; whiter than the air we breathe ; breathe . MOTH once moreAnd I thought I was that girl. * I was , I confess , that girl . p. 17 FRASER OUTERMOST RING I should have stayed at home , Louisa . LOUISA Oh , Uncle Fraser , cool it , will you ? Dear Moth is entitled to her imaginary raptures . FRASER OUTERMOST RING All this resembles nothing so much as a Sikkimese hangover . COUSIN JULIA Do n't like it , Fraser , when the hens come home to roost ? FRASER OUTERMOST RING Witchetty , all of it . Witchetty . Witchetty . Witchetty . LOUISA What 's " Witchetty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dahlia do you mean ? Aunt BIANCA brightens . A music of ominous footfalls . A transcendental music lifts our souls . Pause . AUNT BIANCA I was just getting around to that . LOUISA " Witchetty " . What 's it mean ? FRASER OUTERMOST RING How the devil should I know ? A strange , little MAN enters . This is the WHITE DWARF . All freeze except The Marplot , who is the only one to see him . The WHITE DWARF , like the others , is dressed entirely in white except for a red fez with a black tassel . This is the only scenic color in the play ( well , almost ) . The WHITE DWARF mutters to himself angrily . We do not hear much of what he says . He limps over to an audience member ( a shill ) ; grabs that person 's program ; bites it and growls ; rips the program into pieces ; stomps on the pieces , and rolls around on the stage scratching at them with his hind feet , rather like a nasty housecat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror . A Dwarfish pause . Suddenly the WHITE DWARF catches sight of the Marplot , gets to his feet , and begins to mutter again . We hear only the following amidst his demented garble and cackling. p. 18 WHITE DWARF " Witchetty " ! Witchetty , ha . It 's all one big Polo Bear bottom . One big white torpedo . An obsessional white horde , ha ! Now he begins taking flash pictures of FRASER with his instant Kodak . The latter grimaces in the agony of unwilling exposure ; but the WHITE DWARF continues , briefly , examining each photo before discarding it with gleeful contempt ; The WHITE DWARF moons The Marplot , who thereupon faints . Before exiting , he places his visiting card in The Marplot 's open mouth . A stuffed ZEBRA , on wheels , appears just at the lip of the stage . Greeting this with delight , the WHITE DWARF carefully places his camera on the stage , where it shall remain for the rest of the play , lit by a pin-light . Pause . The transcendental music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zebra ( his trophy ) in tow . The MUSICIANS are the first to snap out of it , and begin to play in a more soothing vein  --  but still their old Bad Jazz . AUNT BIANCA I said . I was just getting around to that . COUSIN JULIA Getting around to what ? The Ninny spies The Marplot stretched out at her feet , and let 's out a short but energetic scream . Lights back to normal . All focus on him ; MOTH alone smiles because , with all her years and wisdom , she finds the scene amusing ; LOUISA leans over to remove from FRASER 's open mouth the visiting card which the WHITE DWARF has placed there . She reads : p. 19 LOUISA Parking lot of the Wallmart on Route 7 . Near the dumpster . At the back of the abandoned Weiss Mechanical-Musical Flea Circus Factory . This Tuesday . Four pm . Be there . The Dwarf will lead you on from there . White Whiskey John , Assistant to the Disputant . The Marplot has come to his senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost tearful . COUSIN JULIA Disputant ? We shall have no disputes during the holiday . Fraser , what does this mean ? LOUISA I 'm sure there is a rational explanation , cousin Julia . AUNT BIANCA Moth , what can this mean ? Whatever can this mean ? LOUISA White whiskey John ? MOTH It 's a kind of shrike . All look at MOTH with surprise . AUNT BIANCA And what I was going to suggest is that we call it a day , since the photographer seems to have disappeared . All look at JULIA , who feigns innocence.And Fraser has suffered from a stroke or othermoral lapse ; and the musicians , or whatever they are , have assumed a dark and gloomy aspect , probably because they are waiting to bepaid ; and they shall not be paid ; And they shall not be paidbecause there is no money to pay them with ; The music stops.And they shall not be paid , because they are dark and witchetty , andpossibly in league with the Adversary ; And they shall not be paid , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds the authorityand controls the purse-strings governingthe writing of checks ; And they shall not be paid , because their music is of a disturbing kind , and lacks the melodious harmoniousness whichabove all the family fancies on these occasions , such as Founder 's Day , or the Day of the Signingof the Originary Document ; or on White-Handed Goose Day ; orWoonsocket Day ; orGravity Feed Day ; orMoon Dead Dog Day ; orAnna Innermost Ring Day ; oron Prickled Bloatfish Day or p. 20 COUSIN JULIA You are not making any sense , Bianca . AUNT BIANCA That is because I wish to return to my little room , and hide behind my little floral screen COUSIN JULIA We all wish to return to our little rooms , and we all wish to hide behind our little floral screens , but all the rest of us have the internal fortitude and the will power to resist that temptation . AUNT BIANCA I know , I know , I know . Pause . Something happens in the vicinity of The Marplot 's nose . Something connected to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is aware of the possibility of the WHITE DWARF 's return . COUSIN JULIA In fact , Bianca . In fact you are resorting to your old bad habits . AUNT BIANCA Julia , how can you say that ? In what way can I be said to be resorting to my old bad habits ? COUSIN JULIA You know . AUNT BIANCA I do not know . COUSIN JULIA Yes you do . AUNT BIANCA No I do n't . A standoffish pause . COUSIN JULIA Yes you do . p. 21 AUNT BIANCA No I do n't . COUSIN JULIA You know . AUNT BIANCA I do not . LOUISA Er , COUSIN JULIA Shut up , you feeble-minded white-handed tree-mouse . AUNT BIANCA Just because I would like to tip-toe into the kitchen and out the back way COUSIN JULIA Yes ? AUNT BIANCA Out the back way , and down the steps that lead to the other place ; Universal fear at the mere mention.The other place , you call the Gaming Room ( FRASER ) ; and you ( LOUISA ) call the Montessori Bughouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highborn Muskrat Hideaway ; and you ( MUSICIANS ) call the Take-After Take-Out Taj Majal ; and you , Julia , call the White-Haired White Leather White Tie ; but is , in fact , only the antique cupboard , or chiffonnier , that was Great Aunt Dahlia 's . COUSIN JULIA And is now her final resting place . AUNT BIANCA I only want a teensy peek . Teensiest of the teensy . COUSIN JULIA It is a low , depraved wish on your part , Bianca . Ancestor worship must aspire to more elegant expression in our contemporary Rhode Island , dear . p. 22 LOUISA Er , COUSIN JULIA Shut up , you hideous white crappie . Shock . The Grand Parade gestures to the MUSICIANS , who begin to play more or less morally affirming music  --  Whited sepulchers . Whited hypocrites and and creatures of the blench .

AUNT BIANCA The trouble of driving here , all the way from my little room in suburban Kama-Loka . COUSIN JULIA That is not such a far place . I drove all the way from Paris , France . MOTH Disaster , disaster , disaster . COUSIN JULIA  --  AUNT BIANCA  --  LOUISA Er , COUSIN JULIA Be quiet please . LOUISA Er , COUSIN JULIA Please . LOUISA Er , I was only going to point out that it has begun to stop snowing . All look about , as if to confirm or contradict this assertion . COUSIN JULIA It has begun to do no such thing . Indeed , The Grand Parade is , on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster , disaster . Aunt BIANCA lies down on the stage , and thrashes both hands and feet in total postverbal frustration . One of the MUSICIANS grows bold ( the First ) ; All glare at him disapprovingly ; he loses his nerve ; BIANCA rages once more ; his nerve returns ; he approaches very close to JULIA 's chin . MUSICIAN ONE We will be paid . COUSIN JULIA I beg your pardon ? MUSICIAN ONE We have played some music , some pretty darn good music and we will be paid . MUSICIAN TWO Yes . It is only right that , as god fearing tax payers , that we be paid . COUSIN JULIA Go whistle for it then . All turn their backs on the poor MUSICIANS ; save MOTH who has put on her snow shoes and trudged out ; and FRASER who is studying the card lately placed in his mouth by The WHITE DWARF ; Ambivalent as ever , LOUISA does not know what to do , nor with whom to sympathize so she counts imaginary rabbits as they hop on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to MUSICIAN TWO who thereupon sings a song:I am in an economic hell ; bell , do not ring for mebell , do not ring for mebell , do not ring for me because I am not not at alland I have lost my whiteness. p. 25 BOTH MUSICIAN Have lost thereby , lost my rightness , it 's true.And have lost my rightness . BOTH AND LOUISA Oh what a hell . Oh what a hell . ALL THREE Oh , rabbit of lossI am in an economic hellBelltell me what to do .

Cousin Julia the Eraser so called because of her strange ability to cause people and things to vanish . Whole epochs of the family chronicle caused to disappear under the insidious rub a dub dub of her India rubber eraser . Most of the chronicle from the time of Fraser1 and Fraser2 reduced to powder , mere pulverized rubber . Similarly , my own childhood , the time of my own father , Fraser3 has become , through her doing , a horrid , white blank or blot . An empty page in an old old book , once hallowed , now hollow .

DISPUTANT In this particular instance , you have confused your doing , the doing of Fraser4 with those of your ancestor , Fraser1 The Marplot is stunned . He looks out : can this be ? You have confused Late Capitalism with the dawn of the Wealth of Nations ; mediocrity with accomplishment ; parasitical decline with the miracle of appearance . Sudden realization . p. 35 FRASER OUTERMOST RING Oh , now I see . Quietly.My own failings , modest though they be , are to be confounded with those of my forebears .

Bianca wants to go to the kitchen , and to the old cupboard or chiffonnier , which for the good of all concerned has been closed to public view these long years . She wants to go to the kitchen so she may take a peek . He titters lightly and silvery , almost , but not quite like the DISPUTANT 's Two Assistants . This seems to make them uncomfortable.So she may take a peek ( Can you imagine ? ) BIANCA , MOTH , and JULIA appear high above , in a floral cameo ; they echo his last ; BIANCA , MOTH , and JULIA take a peek ( Can you imagine ? ) He is a little unnerved by this .

But then the bubble grew in swollen in swollen wonderment , and we all grew richer even than the Rings who worked for it . Yes , richer by far . He whistles in the bubble of his wonderment , intensely white.And so radical Aunt Blank went off to gay Paree , much to the shame of the family and became at first a photograph ( Can you imagine ? ) ; and then , and then : and became a rhododendron ; and became a speck of hoarfrost ; and became a hangnail ; and became a doorstop ; and became a great white peach louse ; and became a whited sepulcher ; and BECAME A PARROT . p. 37 THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offin the name of Jesus.Shake the devil offin the name of Jesus .

For concealed within that penchant lay the even deeper obsession , common to all us Rings , Innermost and Outermost alike , to go back to the starting point with a series of with a series of searching questions.And thus to initiate an interrogation , in the simplest of language , but an interrogation nevertheless . A drastic interrogation.Simple terms . Drastic interrogation.Much like this one , in fact . DISPUTANT And ? And so ?

Young Fraser was wholly innocent , at the time , of the darker implication of the project , and was promptly stationed at Turku , in the Karelian Isthmus.Young Fraser , like many in those days , believed what he had been told : that the Soviet Union must be stopped in her aggression against tiny Finland , a truth as apparent to him as the fact that Stalingrad had been named for Lenin.He and a young colleague , Truesdale , came to be posted on a low bluff , near the outermost ring of Turku , with an ancient Maxim gun from the Great War , seven crates of rusty ammunition , and a firing radius of 45 degrees . The Finns deposited these young Americans here thinking the main Russian thrust would come well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Gum Arabic to her whitish gums LOUISA once more counts imaginary rabbits as they hop on her knee.For several hours , the two discussed boyish things such as Fraser 's shocking escape from the altar at the rehearsal of his wedding to young Dinah Morgan , a relation to the great magnate of Hartford  --  and ever after a source of embarrassment to the family.Do you think , do you think , Clyde , for that was Truesdale 's Christian name , that I did the right thing or was I a cad ; or was I a cad to do the right thing ? or was I not a cad even though the thing was not the right thing ? Or was the act both wrong and right and hence undecidable , and therefore was I not in fact both a cad and not a cad ? Both P and Not P in the symbolic logic of Nkosi Whiteman Rudge , his tutor and of late a disciple of both Russell and Wittgenstein . p. 50 LOUISA  --  MOTH Truesdale , ended the conversation and incidentally , their friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you strike me simply as a passive aggressive hostile fuck ! As it began to darken and glower ; as it began to darken and glower and to snow rather heavily.An uncomfortable few minutes passed with this reply hanging heavily in the air.And all this despite Dinah Morgan 's exceptional pallor.But just at this momentFraser happened to catch sight of something rising slowly out of the snow , at the far end of the snowy field . A snowy figure , in fact . She adjusts the working of her teeth and gums.And then another , and then another , and another . Slowly arising like squat , appalling snowmen from the snowfield , each indistinguishable in hue from the field itself ; each figure arising then slowly , very slowly trudging towards the two lads . What is that ? quipped Fraser . Damned if I know , responded his fellow ; but what it was , was the Russian Winter Army , yes , advancing slowly but inexorably across the snowy field and through the snowy haze . Young Fraser watched in astonishment , and so did young Truesdale.Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vortices.At three hundred meters Fraser and Truesdale opened fire , raking the open field from one side to the other , rat-a-tat-tat , rat-a-tat-tat ; For a time Fraser would fire and Truesdale would feed the long belt of cartridges ; then Truesdale would fire and Fraser would feed . Oh , the advancing snowmen would fall silently one after another , and be buried in the mounting drifts of snow . Be buried as more and more snowmen rose behind them in the white mists beyond , near the edge of the white wood.And thus it went for hour upon hour . The little rat-a-tat-tat , rat-a-tat-tat of their Maxim , and the slowly toppling snowmen , advancing only to be mowed down , row upon row upon row.All day this went on : the two young boys slowly raking their 45 degrees of angle , filling the snowy vortices of that nameless place with a death more breathtakingly beautiful than any Christmas scene . Time passed even asTime seemed to stop.And no more snowmen came . All were dead And for another few minutes the snow fell and quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure how you would denominate such an event . LOUISA by now listening closelyA massacre , I would say . p. 51 MOTH I was just thinking the same thing , Louisa . A massacre . Yes , I suppose I would call it that . Pause for reflection.The two young men never spoke of this incident ; nor ever exchanged a word . Ever again . I must go now and check on poor Great Aunty Dahlia . You too like Fraser and the rest are new to the secrets of this house , for Great Aunty Dahlia grows unquiet unless I apply whitening unguents to the creases and folds of her indescribable pallor . Even now I can hear the hinges of her cupboard creaking , creaking ever so slightly . She gets up with her bucket of beans , turns out a light and is gone . LOUISA slowly stands and goes to the window . JULIA and BANCA smile at LOUISA , and go out , gravely . MOTH returns , for one last twist of the knife . MOTH The white identity , his father Fraser3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false effigies . A row of object zeroes . She disappears , leaving poor LOUISA alone . Something happens somewhere . LOUISA stands and speaks , all without the slightest pause ; LOUISA The sky was gray , like that day in the Karelian Isthmus , but there was a white gleam behind , and from where I was sitting I could look down on the town of Newport , and it was still and quiet and white , like a picture.I remembered that it was on that hill that Moth ( or someone very much like her , maybe even older and more white ) taught me to play an old game called " Whizzbang " in which one had to dance , and wind in and out of a pattern in the grass , and then when one had danced and turned long enough the other person asks you questions , and you ca n't help answering whether you want to or not , and whatever you are told to do you feel you have to do it . This person said there used to be a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was one by which people could be turned into anything you liked and an old man her great grandmother had seen had known a girl who had been turned into a large snake . And there was another very ancient game of dancing and winding and turning , by which you can take a person out of himself and hide him away as long as you like , and his body went walking about quite empty without any sense in it .
