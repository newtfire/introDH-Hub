UNITED STATES DEMOCRATIC REVIEW . APRIL , 1856 . GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES . IN a memorial presented to the President of the United States , and the Senate and House of Representatives , by the merchants and traders of the city of Baltimore , in the year 1806 , they say : " The relations which subsist between Great Britain and the United States rest upon the basis of reciprocal interests , and your memorialists see in those interests , as well as in the justice of the British government , and the firmness oar own , the best reasons to expect a satisfactory answer to their complaints . * * * The means of redress for the past , and security for the future , are respectfully , confidently submitted to your wisdom ; but your memorialists can not forbear to indulge hope , which they would abandon with deep reluctance , that they may yet be found in amicable explanations with those who have ventured to inflict wrongs upon us , and to advance unjust pretensions , to our prejudice . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the author of the memorial referred to , was appointed Minister Extraordinary to the Court of St. James . Mr. Monroe was also at that time Minister-resident near that Court . If genius , learning , and patriotism could have succeeded in bringing the government of Great Britain to consider with impartiality the points at issue , those shining qualities were so happily 19 // blended in our ministers that such a result could scarcely be doubtful . The expectations which based themselves , as in the Baltimore Memorial , upon the " justice of the British government , " or , with apparently better foundation on the skill and character of our negotiators , were rudely disappointed . Those which arose from a confidence in the . " firmness " of the government of the United States received a noble confirmation . Very early after Mr. Pinckney 's aTrival at his post , Sir John Nicholl , King 's Advocate-General , made a report in which he justified the British practice of impressing seamen on board of neutral vessels on the high seas . In a note to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and dismisses it with that contemptuous epithet . Yet the Englisi ministry persisted in acting upon the principles laid down in Nicholl 's report , until the encounter between the President and Little Belt relieved diplomacy of its burden , and substituted shot and shell for notes and protocols . In a word , seamen were impressed , often with circumstances of insult which aggravated the wrong , from beneath our flag ; the rights , of neutrals invaded ; compensation for spoliations of American commerce denied ; the rule of the war of 1756 insisted upon ; the orders in council of 1807 and 1809- " Which in their motive , principle , and operation , were utterly incompatible with our existence as a commercial people " - enforced , even after Napoleon had practically abandoned , with regard to the United States , the celebrated Berlin and Milan decrees ; - reparation for wrongs already committed ; security against future aggression ; even indeed the barren cou*rtesy of explanation contemptuously refused : and such an attitude assumed by Great Britain as left to the United States but one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to sue for mercy , to beg of his Majesty s ministers permission to exist on any terms they saw fit to grant , or to summon fate into the lists , and upon the ocean , and th' battle-field , " champion it to the utterance . " The genius of the American people , at all times eminently warlike , naturally seized upon the latter . The brilliant feats of arms performe the successes achieved , on land and sea , by American conduct and valor , decided in our favor the points at issue between the two nations , and introduced into the General Code of international law the first recognition of the rule , that the flag covers the cargo . The sacredness of the persons of seamen beneath a neutral flag came also , as between Great Britain and the United States , to be tacitly admitted . // From that war the feeble and once-despised navy of the United States came out " its forehead circled and adorned by the laurels it had torn from the brow of the naval genius of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out , with a well-earned reputation , as the equals of England 's most veteran regiments . From it the whole country issued with a just increase of confidence in its own power , dignity , resources , and capacity to resist aggression , and compel adherence to the faith of treaties . In the language of Mr. Cass , March 10th , 1856 : " When we entered . upon our last war with England our flag was contemptuously designated as striped bunting , and our armed ships as fir-built frigates . But when we came out of it , that striped bunting had so often floated over St. George 's cross , and those fir-built frigates had so often redeemed their character in desperate conflicts , and by capturing their opponents , that even national vanity , in its own defense , was compelled to admit the prowess of our gallant navy . " Into that war , however , we did not enter until we were pushed upon it as our supreme remedy . We continued to appeal to English j ustice , and to persuade ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would be accorded , until a long and persevering course of diplomatic insincerity , and frequent acts of wanton and unprovoked aggression , on the part of Great Britain , proved , irrefragably , that the siu* gle motto of English policy was : " That he . shall get who has the power , And he shall keep who can. ** Actuated by the same spirit of forbearance , and anxious to cultivate the most friendly relations with a people whose real interests are , as it were , almost identified with our own , the government of the United States , from the termination of the war , and the treaty of Ghent in 1814 , up to the present moment , has constantly displayed a rare and admirable temper . An impartial history of that half-century would exhibit it to the world as a model of mingled firmness and forbearance . Unhappily , English ministers and diploniatists fail to . appreciate either the power or justice of the principle which contrdls the policy of our government . Accustomed to . expediency as the common guide of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our intercourse and relationships with other States are governed by the inflexible rule , * to ask nothing but what is right , and submit to nothing that is wrong , " // that we do no more than utter one of the sounding phrases with which diplomacy at once amuses and betrays . The mistake is a grave one . The language of American diplomacy is not made to conceal its thoughts . The principle which maintains our national existence is truth . To that principle the acts of all the agents of the Republic must conform . When they violate its spirit they cease to be the representatives or exponents of American pAnciples or policy . To that princi .. plc the conduct of the government of the United States has conformed ; and by it its policy has been directed throughout the entire correspondence and negotiations with Great Britain , relative to Central America , and foreign enlistments upon American soil . And if an all-wise but inscrutable Providence , should strike the present ministry of England with blindness to the careful forbearance we have manifested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long and unwisely insisted upon maintaining ; if every pacific means having been exhausted , as before , namely , in 1812-14 , we should be compelled , by the interests and honor of a great nation , to vindicate the principles of its existence , and defend the rights on which its national future depends - our government through all vicissitudes will , at least , be able to console itself with the reflection , that it omitted no honorable means to avert the horrors of war , and appealed to the decision of God , only when hope had ceased in the justice of man . The attitude now occupied by the governments of Great Britain and the United States is precisely analagous to that in which they stood on the day that the " President " fired into the " Little Belt . " The line of demarcation between peace and war is often faint . A single slip of diplomatic India-rubber , and it is rubbed out . A single hot-headed naval captain , on a station which requires more coolness than courage ; a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miles away  --  and the mischief is done . Is it the purpose of the English press to bring about such a state of things  --  to provoke some fiery Tar to such an act ? The tone they have lately adopted , silly as it is , affords very plausible reason to think so . Before they proceed farther in this business , it will be the part of wisdom for both the English press , and the Cabinet of St. James* to understand , that whilst the present Administration fully comprehends all the blessings of peace , it is not prepared to buy them by the sacriflee of a single penny-worth either of principle or honor . It // will also much assist them in arriving at such a conclusion as results will warrant , to take as the basis of their calculations these facts , namely : That the American government clearly understands its position ; that from that position it can neither be coaxed nor driven ; that its policy being inseparably connected with all the interests of the country , commends itself to something better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , therefore , backed by the common sentiment of patriotism shared by all American citizens , and will receive their hearty and unanimous support ; and , finally , that the gentleman at the head of the State department , however it may be necessary to the feverish and unhealthy existence of certain partisan presses to attack and undervalue him , has long since proved himself the ablest war minister we have ever had ; and is probably , the coolest , most astute and longest-headed Premier in any cabinet existing at the present day . Let us examine for a moment the position which the honorable Secretary of State now occupies . In our opinion that position has been wisely assumed . That it will be immovably maintained , the character of the man , the exigencies of the time , and the strongly-pronounced sentiment of the American people leave us no room to doubt . But to arrive at a just comprehension of that position we must commence at the beginning and follow all the steps which have , year by year , led up to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be necessary to give a digest of the history of the negotiations between the governments of Great Britain and the United States , on the subject of Central America ; and also of the attempt on the part of the former to enlist American citizens , within the jurisdiction of the latter , as material of war against a power with which we were then , and still continue to be not only at profound peace , but also upon intimate terms of friendship . Great Britain has claimed that a title to the Mosquito shore , by right of possession , accrued to her so early as the seventeenth century . In the treaty with Spain , in 1786 , she surrendered it , by the fourteenth article , to Spain . By the second and third articles of the same treaty , a certain right was secured to British subjects in the district of country , lying along the shores of the Bay of Honduras , called the " Belize " That right was defined and laid down in the " second article " as being simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In return for the concession of this right , Great Britain covenanted and agreed that her subjects should never use the right so limited , as an excuse or pretext for assuming // any other right , or exercising any other privilege within that district . Up to a late period no larger claims were advanced by the British government . Upon the Mosquito shore , subsequent to the treaty of 1786 , she never had any rights , and the feeble effort made by the opposition in Parliament , in 1787 , to assume even the right accruing from temporary occupancy and organization , was at once cried down and defeated . There was yet some honesty in 1787 . And in that very debate Lord Chancellor Thurlow , who defended the Administration , relied upon nothing but the clause re*pecting the " Belize , * ' and indeed denied , in terms , that either Great Britain or the Mosquito Indians had any claims beyond what might be warranted by that clause . To the territorial extent , and for the limited uses described in the treaty of 1786 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States that Great Britain had the right to continue in the possession of the district known as the " Belize . " To any greater extent , or for any different purpose the legality of her assumptions has been denied and contested by us from the beginning . ilaving abandoned by the treaty of 1783 , and yet more distinctly by that of 1786 , the Mosquito shore , that section of country was reincorporated with the Spanish crown . But the Mosquito Indians had been the allies of Great Britain in the war with Spain . She , therefore , stipulated with the latter that no act of severity should be exercised against them on that account . That was the whole extent of her " Protectorate . " Nor does it even appear that she was ever at any extraordinary pains to investigate whether his Catholic majesty kept faith upon that head , or whether he caused her dusky allies to be comfortably shot or hanged for the assistance they had afforded his enemies . " When Great Britain determined to resume her dominion over the Mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known with any degree of certainty in the United States . The first information on the subject , in the Department of State , at Washington , was contained in a dispatch of the 20th January , 1842 , from William L. Murphy , Esq. , special agent of the American government at Guatemala , in which he states that , in a conversation with Colonel McDonald at Belize , the latter had informed him he had discovered and sent documents to England , which caused the British government to revive their claim to the Mosquito territory . " This and subsequent information led to the negotiations , // which resulted in the conclusion of the treaty of 1850 , known as the " Clayton-Buiwer Treaty . " By that treaty of April 19th , 1850 , it was agreed that a kind of joint protectorate should be exercised by Great Britain and the United States over a specific thing , namely , an inter-oceanic ship-canal , to connect the Atlantic and Pacific . They further agreed , " that neither the one nor the other will ever obtain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship-canal ; agreeing that neither will ever erect or maintain any fortifications commanding the same , or in the vicinity thereof ; or occupy , or fortify , or colonize , or assume , or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua , Costa Rica , the Mosquito coast , or any part of Central America. ** But , at the time of the conclusion of this convention , Great Britain was in possession of the Island of Ruatan ! What , and where was Ruatan ? It was a Central American island , belonging to the State of Honduras , and lying within thirty miles of her port of Truxillo . It was an island of great value and importance . Its harbors were fine , its position most commanding . The key of the Bay of Honduras , its occupation or fortification by either party , to the treaty of 1850 , was clearly a most insulting breach of the conditions of that convention . In the possession of either power , the commerce of the other , by the isthmus , must lie at the mercy of the occupant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they abandon iRuatan ? Did they comply , in good faith , with the terms and conditions of the treaty of 1850 ? On the contrary , they proceeded to new invasions both of its spirit and its letter . The island of IRuatan was captured in 1841 by Colonel McDonald , then her Britannic Majesty 's superintendent at Belize . Great Britain continued to occupy it up to the year 1850 . She continues to do so to the present time . In 1850 , and after the conclusion of the Claytou-Bulwer treaty , she established a colonial government over it . Nay , indeed , as if actuated by a spirit of insulting bravado ; as if resolved to show that the purpose of her treaties was to bind others , whilst she remained " legibus solutus , " and unclogged by the respect or fear of any in her avarice of empire ; as if bent upon securing her own ends , and acquiring , at whatever hazard , or by whatever faithlessness , a station from which she could command the great avenue of communication between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy five other islands of the same group , and converted them all into the British colony of the " Bay Islands . " // Startled by these indications of a purpose inevitably hostile , in its result , to the continuance of a good understanding between the two governments , the United States made strong representations to her Majesty 's government . Negotiations were commenced afresh , and dragged their slow length along until 1854 . In that year , Mr. Buchanan submitted a " statement , " containing the majority of the points to which we have rqferred , to the Earl of Clarendon . By that statement he advertised her Majesty 's ministers , in very plain and unequivocal terms , that the government of the United States seriously contested the claim of Great Britain to any part og or foothold upon the soil of Central America . That iRuatan , and the Bay Islands , were a part and portion of Central America . That Central America had assumed , from the circumstance of the railroads and *anals proposed to be constructed through the isthmus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the mutual desire of Great Britain and the United States to prevent each other from being placed in a position to exercise exclusive control , in peace or in war , over any of the grand thoroughfares between the two oceans , had been the controlling reason which dictated the Clayton and Bulwer convention . That for a good and valuable consideration , namely , the abstaining of the United States from occupancy or fortification of any point in Central America , etc. , etc. , Great Britain clearly agreed not only to abstain in like manner , but also to withdraw from each and every possession she might have previously occupied* except her limited occupancy of the Belize . " And yet the British* government , up till the present moment , have not deemed it proper to take the first step towards the performance of their obligations under the convention , ( of 1850 . ) They are still in the actual occupancy of nearly the whole coast of Central America , including the island of Ruatan , in the very same manner that they were before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having thus clearly manifested itself ; and the fact that they did not intend to adhere to the terms and conditions of the treaty of 1850 , as plainly and unmistakably defined by words which would admit of no other fair or honest construction than that put upon it by the government of the United States , the latter were compelled to ask that it should either be faithfully executed by both parties , or else cease to be used as a cloak to the British government for acts and designs not only never contem // plated by the government of the United States ; but , on the contrary , intended to be expressly provided against by them , and supposed to have been so provided against by the treaty of 1850 . Thus driven to the wall , the government of Great Britain was obliged to confess in effect that they never meant to observe the treaty ; that it was in simple verity no more than a diplomatic trick and subterfuge . To have said this in so many words ; to have said it frankly at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty 's ministers . It would have indeed been a death-bed repentance ; but at least better than norre at all . This was , however , a sacrifice to honesty and plainness of speech ; a practical confession of their want of both , through the whole preceding negotiation , of which they were not capable . They replied , therefore , that the very evident interpretation of the treaty of 1850 was that the United States should not colonize , fortify , acquire , or control , directly or indirectly , any part or portion of the states or territories of Central America ; and also that England had magnanimously stipulated and agreed to adhere to the same conditions . But , of course-how pleasing the irony of that " of course " - of course the terms of the treaty could have no reference to territory possessed and held by Great Britain prior to the conclusion of the treaty of 1850 . Which , in plain Saxon-English , was to say : " What we have we mean to keep ; and we merely nose-led our good simple cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from getting any thing for himself . The trade to California and China is entirely too valuable to be left to his control . We have the Bay Islands , ' therefore we mean to fortify and maintain ourselves there . They are the key of the door through which that trade must pass . Nobody shall have it but ourselves , and whenever it is necessary to maintain our commercial superiority by shutting that door , we will shut it . Meantime , and for the purpose of amusing you , we will negotiate and diplomatize with you . You are very young . Wide-awake enough , perhaps , in small matters of trade and commerce . But you have a great deal to learn yet . The grand scope of British statesmanship ; its prophetic grasp of the future , is quite beyond you . After we have amused you a few years with trifles suited to your age ; put you , in fact , through your A , B , Cs , and horn-book of diplomacy , we will lay before you the complete British Reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art to make the worse appear the better reason , you may disport yourselves , and learn a // great deal which will be useful to you for the next hundred years of your national existence . You ought to be sincerely grateful to us for the trouble we are taking to educate you ! " - We appreciate the benevolence of the proposition , and reply " Miarcy ! " - If you , gentlemen , Her Majesty 's adroit Ministers and astute Counsellors , can really out-wit him , we are perfectly willing to be matriculated as a member of the " Freshman Class ' ! in the Royal English College of Diplomacy . Till then we must be pardoned for saying , that , in our humble opinion , the present Cabinet of Great Britain is scarcely a body competent to complete the diplomatic educ*tion of either William L. Marcy or James Buchanan . A glance at the communication of Lord Clarendon , dated May 2d , 1854 , and at Mr. Buchanan 's reply , July 22d , of the same year , will dispose most minds , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the claims long since exploded , and drawing a pleasing , but airy and fanciful distinction between holding possessions in Mosquito , and holding the Mosquitos in possession , Lord Clarendon with a graceful air of disdain waves away the whole subject , and with a naYvet6 which would be delicious in a pretty woman , but which sits oddly enough on a wrinkled diplomatist , feels assured that " the government of the United States will not be surprised if the government of Great Britain abstains from entering into any thing which might appear an explanation or defense of its conduct with regard to its longestablished protectorate of the Mosquitos . " It is painful to be compelled to disappoint his lordship 's expectation ; but , by all the gods at once , that is the very thing which the government and people of the United States are surprised at . Possibly as no good reason can be given why one man should dislike a gaping pig , or why another can not bear " a harmless necessary cat ; " so none can be rendered why Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , her royal cousin of " Bluefields . " Men of evil minds have suggested that her love for him is of much the same kind as the Wolf 's in Little IRed Riding Hood , for that meritorious child ; and that when , one of these days , his Sable Kingship of Mosquito shall inadvertently say , " Dear Cousin Victoria , what a great big mouth you have ; " the answer will be- " That 's to eat you all up-my dear ! " Be that as it may , Lord Clarendon will be hanged and drawn first , before he will let the wolf out of the bag . So he waives the explanation , and gives us a very polite bow in its place . For the bow , as for all other mercies , we trust we may be made duly thankful . His lordship next lays down a new principle // in the law of nations , namely , that when a part of an empire constitutes itself into a distinct sovereignty , and its independence is recognized by civilized nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the territory of which the new sovereignty is constituted are not transferred , and vested in the latter , or necessarily recognized as belonging to it by Her Majesty 's Government . By this happy fiction of English diplomatic law , the recognition of the Independence of the United States , by Great Britain , does not release any of the original rights of Great Britain to the territory of which they are composed . Does Her Majesty 's Government anticipate a time when it will be necessary for it to exert also a Protectorate over the United States , as well as Mosquito ? Lord Clarendon also repudiates , with an ill-concealed sneer , the doctrine laid down by President Monroe in 1823-that " the American Continents , by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintained , are henceforth not to be considered subjects for future colonization by any European powers . " His Lordship 's sneer is ill-timed . Mr. Buchanan tells him " that doctrine has received the public and official sanction of subsequent Presidents , as well of a very large majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American minister 's plain-dealing contrasted with his lordship 's diplomatic shuffling , and we are compelled to think , that although Her Majesty 's government " can not now admit it , " before the question is finally settled to his lordship 's satisfaction or ours , Her Majesty 's government will , however reluctantly , concede " that doctrine as an international axiom which ought to regulate the conduct of European States . " Why , my lord , We , the American People , believe that doctrine to be " truth as true as holy writ . " We should deeply regret the necessity of propagating it by the sword , or of punishing resistance to it with bomb and round-shot ; but it must have free course . We will preach , it to you in love , if you will hear . But if you will none of our counsel , we must back our opinion with our steel . It is a great truth , that Monroe doctrine , may it please Her Majesty 's government . Our future greatness depends very much upon our maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God has joined us to these American continents , as man and wife are joined ; and what God joins together , man must not put asunder . There may be questions about balances of power in Europe . There can be none with us . The United States are Ike power of this Western world . We say this very gently , and with great good-humor ; but we // mean it . It is not a thing to rave about or bluster over . It is a plain substantive fact . We would be truly glad if her Majesty 's Ministers would accept it frankly , and to the end of the game play " a brother 's wager " ; but , if they will not , he that is the less cunning of fence " will take nothing but his shame , and the odd hits . " Nor can this information be distasteful to Lord Clarendon , or Her Majesty 's government , since he declares distinctly , and with his hand upon his loyal English heart , that " Her Majesty 's government has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central America . Truly we rejoice to hear it . Our minds are much relieved . But why all this pother , then ; why this engendering of malice ; this sowing of uncharitableness ; this increase of the British fleet in the West-Indies ; these new regiments to Canada , and all the bellicose bluster , and bobadil swagger of the Times , and Chronicle , and Pos4 and Telegraph ? What is it all about ? You have no projects of ambition . Surely we have none-Republican America can not be ambitious . That is a vice of kings . The royal rage of conquest , and godlike thirst for blood , is not a republican failing . How much we think alike . At least Lord Clarendon says so . But Mr. Buchanan has found , it seems , " inaccuracies " in his lordship 's resum6 of the points in Mr. Buchanan 's statement of January 6 , 18*4 . Little gentlemanly slips , we presume : slight mistakes as to dates , facts , rights , principles , consequences , peace , war , and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard man , this Mr. Buchanan , and quite careless of his lordship 's shattered nerves . He insists upon correcting his lordship 's " cakeology . " We think we see the faded smile upon his lordship 's wearied face . These rude , naked truths , disgusting things with not a rag of deceit or flummery about them , are really shocking . How ill-bred to force Her Majesty 's Ministers to listen to them . But Mr. Buchanan has no pityno sentiment : he will do it . He is so rude and downright as to insist that " the rights and duties of the parties must be regulated by the first article of the Convention of April 19th , 1850 . " He is so perseveringly careless of the feelings of his noble adversaries as to call their attention to that first article , and remind them that it declares that neither Great Britain nor the United States will ever occupy , fortify , colonize , etc. , etc. , any part of the country referred to by the Convention . Occupy . Let us print that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use my Lord Castlereagh 's // remarkable trope , " upon which the subject into which they have launched , chiefly hinges . " Occupy ! It is an English word . Now , good Mistress Doll Tear-Sheet , wert thou unwittingly a prophetess , and was Captain Pistol the renowned type of British statesmanship to all time : " He a captain ! Hang him , rogue ! He lives upon mouldy stewed prunes , and dried cakes . A captain ! these villains will make the word captain as odious as the word OCCUPY ; which was an excellent good word before it was ill-sorted . " Truly , so it was , but to be long of the same company with my Lords Palmerston and Clarendon is dangerous to the morality of any word , and our poor occupy has not come away from them scot-free . It has paid toll to their lordships* mill , and a swinging toll-dish they keep , and having left both its morality and its meaning behind it , has come away not even unbolted flour , but a mere undistinguishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How long Yankee good-nature will stand " chaffing " is another question . Also Mr. Senator Cass , a man than whom few living have a more intimate knowledge of : , or better appreciation of the character of English statesmen and diplomats , and the tendency of English principles , feelings , and designs with regard to this country-Mr . Cass seems to be of our advice ; for he says , in his place in the Senate , March 10th , 1856 , speaking of the wholesale bragging and billingsgate of the English press : " Some of the most violent of these papers are the supporters , and under the control of members of the Cabinet ; and appreciate their own position too well to give utterance to a single thought on grave public matters unacceptable to their readers . When , therefore , I read well-turned periods of conciliation uttered by Lord Palmerston , in the House of Peers , while he holds on with characteristic tenacity to the last letter of his construction of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty , by which he maintains that the engagement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any part of Central America does not mean what it says , but it means that she will not occurr any more of it than she claimed at the date of the treaty , or in other words , that she will not increase her occupation-when I read this and then turn to the miserable diatribe , preeminent for its arrogant abuse , against the United States , which has recently appeared in his journal , the Morning Po8t , I am free to confess that the coarse effusion of the paper more than neutralizes the professions of the peer , and in my opinion speaks more truly his sentiments . " And further on , speaking of the magnanimous proposal of Great Britain to refer the meaning of the word Occur* , not to the first English Dictionary at hand , but to the " arbitrament of a friendly power " - he says : // give rise to the least expectation that the views of the ministry will be changed respecting the differences arising out of the Clayton-Buiwer treaty . I see , indeed , there are intimations that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some friendly Power . For one , sir , I do not perceive how such a proposition can be accepted . The question in dispute is hardly a question for reference . It does not relate to disputed facts , nor to the fair construction of the engagements of the parties . It is a mere question as to the meaning of a word  --  the word occupv '  --  to bring the matter within its narrowest compass . I should as soon think of referring to arbitration the meaning of the words free , sovereign , and independent States , in the treaty of peace with Great Britain , which recognize our independence , as the words , occurv and assume and exercise dominion in the Clayton-Bulwer treaty . The former measure would be just as reasonable and honorable as the latter . No arbitrator , whether understanding the English language or not , can tell us better than we now know what a treaty means when it says that neither party shall occurv or . possess any dominion in Central America except in the single case provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OCCUPATION iS retained the treaty is violated , and we profess to know what OCCUPATION means without resorting to the lexicographical knowledge or good offices of friend or foe . " If England can hold possession without OCCUPATION she may make out her case . If she can not , ours is made out . The reference of such a question would be but a subterfuge unworthy of our position and our cause . " Well , indeed it may come to that ; we may have to arbitrate the meaning of " free , sovereign , and independent States , " if Lord Clarendon 's gloss upon the law be correct , and recognizing the independence of a government does not carry with it a recognition of the integrity of its territory . California , for instance , would be a valuable acquisition to the crown of Great Britain . Her Majesty 's government by no means anticipated the acquisition of California by the United States , when the peace of Versailles was concluded in 1783 . On Lord C1arendon*s system of international moralities , Her Majesty 's government can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to the single point at issue , for this quibble about the meaning of a wo*d , which has but one meaning , may amuse , but can neither mislead nor deter the Government of the United States from the pursuit of justice . In the words of Mr. Buchanan-does the language of the Convention of 1850 --  " require that Great Britain , shall withdraw from her existing possessions in Central America , including the Mosquito Coast " ? The British government says it does not . That it interferes with none of their existing possessions . That it is entirely prospective in its operation and effect . That it merely prohibits new acquisitions . To this , Mr. Buchanan replies : " If this be the case , then it // amounts to a recognition of their rights on the part of the American Government , to all the possessions which they already hold , whilst the United States have bound themselves by the very same instrument never , under any circumstances , to acquire the possession of a foot of territory in Central America . The mutuality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain may continue to hold nearly the whole eastern coast of Central America , the United States have abandoned the right for all future time to acquire any territory , or to receive into the American Union any of the States in that portion of their own continent . " This self-imposed prohibition was the great objection to the treaty in the United States at the time of its conclusion , and was powerfully urged by some of the best men in the country . Had it been imagined that whilst it prohibited the United States from acquiring territory , under any possible circumstances , in a portion of America through which their thoroughfares to California and Oregon must pass , the Convention , at the same time , permitted Great Britain to remain in the occupancy of all her existing possessions in that region , Mr. Buchanan expresses the confident conviction that there would not have been a single vote in the American Senate in favor of its ratification . In every discussion it was taken for granted that the Convention required Great Britain to withdraw from these possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Central America . Such was the common sentiment of the government and people of the United States . If any alteration has taken place in that sentiment ; if we no longer feel in as generous a mood , it is because the Government of Great Britain , not satisfied with equality , have clutched at exclusive power , dominion , and OCCUPANCY . Much as the word grates upon the fine nerves of the British Cabinet , we are forced to its repetition ; and to repeat to them also that to American ears that word occuPANcy , coupled with their knowledge of English governmental habits , means " to have and to hold " to their own special and exclusive use , benefit , and behoof  --  and to the exclusion of all others . And , in plain words , the American government and American people will permit no such " occupancy " by any European power . This question must be discussed openly , and frankly - for the people and in the people 's language-not in the jargon of diplomacy . It is American children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no lordly uncles making " babes in the woods " of them . The next generation of // Americans will need all these continents for elbow-room . We can not have English forts and " Bay Tsland " colonies keeping toll-gates on our national highways . We desire to be on terms of peace and amity with all men ; but the friendship of the greatest European nation , if it be only to be bought by a sacrifice of the principle of our own national growth , by a mortgage upon property already vested in us , or even by a post obi4 is too dear for our market . Therefore to the following language of Mr. Cass we may say most heartily , Amen : " This very state of things , however , renders it but the more proper to regard with careful attention the course and conduct of other nations , the pretensions they advance , and the results which their measures appear to foreshadow . Obvious as this duty is , it is scarcely ever fulfilled , but the cry immediately goes forth , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an idle charge , sir ; scarcely deserving serious refutation . To adopt the side of our country in her dispute with a foreign Power is not to desire war ; it is to desire that humiliating concessions should not be made , but that if war is forced upon us we should be ready to meet its responsibilities . Its true aim is to avert war , not to invite it . To avert it by showing that we are aware of our position , and are not to be driven from it by arrogance or injustice . My friend from Tennessee , ( Mr. Bell , ) as true a patriot as we have among us , in his remark the other day , fell into this error . He renewed the oft-repeated story of my bellicose disposition towards England , ( this is his word , not mine , ) founding the charge upon nothing better than the freedom with which I examine her pretensions , and the earnest desire I expressed , as I am convinced that my country is right , that she will yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator seemed to think that this course of discussion here would be considered by England as a determination to cut the gordian knot with the sword . So be it , sir , if she has the arrogance to view the debates here as trenching upon her rights and honor , as a menace , to adopt a phrase which the Senator used upon that occasion . If the statesmen and people of England , in that spirit of assumption so often displayed in her history , connect the free discussion of our cause with the determination , to appeal from the arbitrament of reason to that of force , let them learn to correct their errors in the school of experience . I repeat what I before said  --  the people of this country desire no war with England . Every man knows the calamities which such a rupture would bring with it ; and certainly , at my time of life , and with the experience I have had , I am among the last to look with satisfaction upon such a prospect . But we are not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dust , lest foreign Powers should see in the examination of their conduct a foregone determination to engage in hostilities . I agree at least with one sentiment recently advanced by Lord Pahuerston , that what a government has to consider is the justice of its cause . and what is befitting the honor and dignity of the country . ' That , I trust , will ever be our rule of action , and if it leads to peace , so much the better ; but if to war , we should meet it as we may . We find no example , either formerly or recently in English history , of this careful attention to the feelings of another nation , and of this studied purpose to avoid giving offense by avoiding the discussion of national differences . Why , sir , the people and the press of England // 279 are equally violent in their denunciations of our country and her position . I am not going to quote the terms of abuse so lavishly employed . They show how improvement follows practice ; for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of similar national favors , we have re*ceived none more significant than these . " With one fact we are particularly struck , and that is , the vastly superior ability of Mr. Secretary Mar*y over his British opponents . His whole course has been cool , dignified , temperate , and honest ; whilst that of Her Majesty 's Ministers has unfortunately developed exactly the opposite qualities ; and we are at a loss to decide which is the more amusing , their clumsiness or their irascibility . Nor do we imagine that in the hands of Mr. Dallas the interests of the United States will be exposed to any greater hazard ; or that Her Majesty 's Ministers will find in him a less worthy antagonist than his predecessor . The whole course of this discussion , both in England and America tends very clearly to show two things : first , that England means to occuPY ; and if right will not support her occupation , she will go near to try what might will do for it ; and second , that the government and people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and if right will not persuade her to retire , they will go near to try what might can do in the premises . We had intended to consider the vexed question of British Enlistments in the United States , but our space warns us that the subject must be laid over . In conclusion of the Central American question , we have merely to say , that the government of the United States and the people of the United States are of one accord in that matter ; and while , as a commercial people we deprecate war , as a people chary of their honor , and alive to the vast significance of the question , we are ready , if God will it , upon this issue " to fight until our eye-lids can no longer wag . " We will admit but one line of consideration , namely , " the justice of our cause , and what is befitting the honor and dignity of the country . "                  @ @ @
