Stimulated by the success of liberals in England and Japan ( see p. 25 ) , Socialists , members of the Left Cartel in the Chamber of Deputies spent a busy week trying to overthrow the Poincar government . <P> Having shunned the issue for three years , the Deputies were faced last week with ratifying the Mellon-Berenger Debt Agreement ( TIME , July 8 ) . No other course was open to them . They had either to ratify the agreement or pay a separate War supplies account of 400 millions to the U. S. on Aug. 1 . <P> Early in the week the following extraordinary statement appeared in L'lntransigeant , powerful popular daily : <P> " American friends as well as those Americans who are not our friends , put this in your pipe ; you will never see the color of our $400,000,000 on August first . ' <P> This was not an admission of France 's racial dislike of paying bills so much as admission that the debt agreement would have to be ratified . <P> White chinned Prime Minister Raymond Poincar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , as written , without reservation . Like bilious children avoiding bitter physic , the Deputies fought against ratification and used the issue as excuse to shin-kick the Poincar cabinet . Meeting outside to Chamber , both the Finance Committee and the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted to ratify the debt agreement provided that a reservation was inserted making France 's payments to the U. S. conditional on Germany 's payments to France under the Young plan . Patiently Premier Poincar reiterated that this would never be accepted by the U. S. , which has immovably insisted that Europe 's debts to the U. S. and Germany 's reparations to Europe must be kept separate . He wanted the reservation , if made at all , to be in the form of a separate announcement , noted and communicated to the U. S. apart from the Mellon-Berenger plan . The Opposition was immovable , clung to its reservation . Inflated with temporary success they waited a chance for a test of strength . With Latin complexity , a crisis was built up which had nothing to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt . <P> There had been a parade of wounded veterans in protest against debt ratification . The police had tried to stop the parade . In the Chamber , Deputy Maurice Dormann , representing the veterans , rose to make Minister of the Interior Andr Tardieu admit that during the parade , the bland face of Prefect of Police Jean Chiappe had been twice slapped by an outraged woman . Minister Tardieu assured the honorable deputy that the face of M. Chiappe had not so been slapped . Veteran Dormann declared he had seen it with his own eyes . He suddenly shouted : " As a Deputy , as a war veteran , as a man . I have been insulted ! I demand an official retraction ! " <P> For a few minutes the face of M. Chiappe threatened to upset the government of France . Prime Minister Poincar and Minister Tardieu pleaded anxiously with Deputy Dormann , pointed to the gleeful faces of the Opposition , told M. Dormann that he was being used as a parliamentary tool to overturn the government by creatures afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deputy Dormann hesitated , cooled off , let the " crisis " pass .
