Secretary of State Marshall accused the Soviet Union today of taking German assets at the rate of more than $500.1-000,000 annually from its occupation zone in Germany . He called for the cessation of that and other practices . He asked the Council of Foreign Ministers to agree not , to take anything out ' of Germany after Jan. 1 except reparation deliveries in capital goods , not current production . Unless there is such an agreement , said the Secretary of State , all the ** are wasting their time in London . He called for a positive answer from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov . He did not get it ? Many times in this conference Secretary Marshall has tried-to pin Mr. Molotov down to precise answers to his questions and not once has he succeeded . Today Mr. Melotoy would merely say that . Secretary ' Marshall s charges were unfounded and that he would prove them to be so when4'reparationt were discussed , which should be tomorrow , according to the agenda . Secretary Strikes Back That Secretary Marshall got great satisfaction . in-striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet delegate had been making concerning the western zones of Germany can hardly De doubted . Secretary Marshall asserted that German bilknesses were being taken over into a gigantic Soviet trust and that " much German manpower is being taken out Of productive effort either through forcible seizure or undqr the cover of contracts which are imposed . " It is hard to believe that aside from giving himself that satisfaction Secretary Marshall or any of the other Foreign Ministers got the slightest comfort out of . today proceedings . The sum total of actual accomplishment , after three hours of discussion covering seven paragraphs of the British paper3on economic principles for Germany , was an agreement to take the word " also " out of Paragraph 22 as being confusing . When Mr. Molotov , who was in the chair , triumphantly cried , it seems to me that we are heading for an agreement on . this point , " British Foreign Secretary Bevis grinned and said : " It looks like an also ran . " Confusion Is Compounded If the Ministers removed the Confusion caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . confusion to their proceedings ' . to date . They got themselves ' so tangled in translations , amend= ments , draftings , collations and arguments that on some important points no one can say just . What happened or where the delegates stand . British newspapers tomorrow morning , for instance , will make much of the fact that Secretary Marshall , in a statement about the Soviet zone , came ' out firmly against reparations from the current account . Yet there has been ? no change in that American , posi= tion since the Moscow-Council last spring , so far as can be ascer tamed . The United States , like Britain , has always ' been against. , reparat tions from current production be- , cause , as Secretary Marshall , said today , - the United States would la the end have to pay for snail ' repa. - t , rations or else the German economy would have to be depressed , to such a low level as to prevent the rehabilitation of Germany and : therefore , of Europe . However - the understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ' and raw ma-. teriala already . sent in ; and cm , meet the occupation costa , and ca. , balance her - economy , and if ti-ierC is then anything left overperhap. some of that current productior can go to reparations These " ifs " are so formidable that reparations from current production becomes an academic subject . Therefore it can be taken as certain that the United States and Britain will not in any circumstances yield to the Soviet demand for $10,000,000,000 in reparations , partly from current production from Germany in the next twenty years . The three Western Ministers are waiting for Mr. Molotov to repeat that claim tomorrow only to turn it down and , above all , to ' turn it into very bad propaganda for the Soviet Union in Germany . ' Another confusion today , arose over Mr. Molotov 's acceptance of repayment for German imports of food and raw materials , " as a first charge " on Germany . That seemed to mean that ht put such repayment ahead of reparations but nobody really believes that he meant that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's proceedings it is the complete failure to agree that makes the most sense . All the fundamental divergencies between the three Western powers and the Soviet Union remain . Yet the Foreign : Ainisters are going to go on talking until they get through their agenda , which all concerned , except ? perhaps , Mr. Molotov , earnestly pray will be accomplished before Christmas . There is nothing conducive to the Christmas spirit about this conference , as today 's performance showed from beginning to end . Secretary Marshall charged right in like a boxer resuming a fight after the rest between rounds . " Mr. Molotov yesterday , in asking for additional information on the pride of coal in the Western zone , stated that if We wanted a decision on the question , of exports we should know what the figures are , " Secretary Marshall said . " Yet subsequently Mr. Molotov said that no information from the Soviet zone concerning what had been happening there would be presented until an agreement was reached . Point Is Pursued " I wish to pursue that pqint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the three Western allies , who from time to time have made voluminous reports on matters concerning the situation and policies in their respective zones , are now told that our discussions relating to the treatment of Germany as an economic whole must be conducted without any information whatsoever as to the situation , policies or actions of the Soviet Government in the Eastern zone . " I am utterly unable to perceive any ' justification fo withholding by the Soviet Government of information that I , for my part , consider necessary to the serious consideration of the matters that we have to consider . Such an attitude obviously tends to make our discussions here very unreal . We must know what we are dealing with . " This hundredth effort to pin Mr. Molotov down merely resulted in the Soviet delegate 's saying that there was no procedure requiring representatives on the Control Council to present such information . Further Sharp Exchange There was ' another sharp exchange between Mr. ? Molotov and Secretary Marshall over Paragraph 25 of the-British paper concerning financial reform . Mr. Molotov remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington of new currency for circulation in Western Germany . The possibility of unilateral action appears to have been envisaged already . Such a course has as its aim the hampering of action by the four powers and is against the unity of Germany . " " I 'll state categorically , " replied 3eeretary Marshall , " that the United States has made no decision to issue new currency . On the contrary , the United States delegation included early currency reform for all Germany as an essential for German economic recovery . " And so the afternoon went . Paragraph after paragraph was either the subject of complete disagreement or went into committee for redrafting . There was the usual earnest , defense of the European recovery program by Secretary Marshall and the usual propaganda speech byjdr . Molotov aimed for German consumption . Some observers see tomorrow as the crucial day , since it will be concerned with the all-important question of reparations . If the Soviet Union sticks to its previous demands the Foreign Ministers will indeed , as Secretary Marshall said , be=wasting their time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
