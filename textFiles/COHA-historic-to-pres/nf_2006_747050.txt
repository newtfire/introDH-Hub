Section : CE <p> Patients with obstructive sleep apnea provide significant challenges to the perioperative team . This disorder is often undiagnosed and coexists with other disease processes such as hypertension , congestive heart failure , and cor pulmonale . The prevalence of obesity in American society suggests that an increasing number of patients with sleep apnea will present for surgery . During the perioperative period , life-threatening problems can occur during anesthetic induction and emergence . The pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea is reviewed here along with the anesthesia implications of this disease process . Members of the perioperative team need to be aware of the implications of sleep apnea so that surgical outcomes can be optimized . <p> Orthopaedic surgery provides a significant amount of the case volume in many operative settings . Findings from one recent study indicated that approximately 25% of all surgical patients are at high risk of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ( Murphy &; Vender , 2004 ) . Adverse postoperative outcomes occurred at a higher rate in patients with OSA who underwent hip or knee replacement than the matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanseen , &; Gay , 2001 ) . All staff caring for patients who had undergone orthopaedic surgery should be vigilant for manifestations of OSA , including potentially lethal events such as arrhythmias , myocardial ischemia , hypopnea , and apnea . <p> Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by intermittent closure or narrowing of the upper airway during sleep , which leads to episodes of apnea-hypopnea , arousal , and oxygen desaturation ( Jordan , White , &; Fogel , 2003 ; Krimsky &; Leiter , 2005 ) . This disorder is pervasive and affects nearly 18 million Americans ( Trupp , 2004 ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . Members of the perioperative team need to be concerned about OSA because of its associated long-term morbidity and mortality . <p> As many as 80-95% of persons with OSA are undiagnosed ( Benumof , 2004 ; Moos , Prasch , Cantral , Huls , &; Cuddeford , 2005 ) . It has been estimated that 24% of men and 9% of women , if formally studied during sleep , would have a diagnosis of OSA , and 4% of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Recent research has shown that OSA in patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement is associated with multiple postoperative complications . In this study , almost 30% of patients who had undergone orthopaedic surgery suffered significant postoperative cardiac or pulmonary complications . Patients who were not using continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) devices prior to hospitalization had a higher incidence of significant complications , such as hypoxemia , arrhythmias , myocardial ischemia requiring transfer to the intensive care unit , hypercapnia , apnea , and episodes of delirium , than the patients who were using them ( Gupta et al. , 2001 ) . Therefore , members of the perioperative team may identify OSA before an operative procedure and become gatekeepers of the well-being of an OSA surgical patient . Obstructive Sleep Apnea Terms <p> Apnea is the cessation of airflow at the nose and mouth for more than 10 seconds and indicates complete obstruction of the upper airway ( Moos et al. , 2005 ; Trupp , 2004 ) . Apnea is considered obstructive if there is continued respiratory effort despite airflow cessation , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no concurrent respiratory effort ( Qureshi , Ballard , &; Nelson , 2003 ) . Hypopnea is defined as a 50% reduction in airflow for 10 seconds for 15 or more times per hour of sleep associated with snoring and a 4% decrease in oxygen saturation . It connotes a transient reduction in airflow caused by increased upper airway resistance ( Benumof , 2004 ; Friedman , Ibrahim , &; Joseph , 2004 ; Qureshi et al. ; Trupp ) ( Table 1 ) . <p> Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is diagnosed by polysomnography using an apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) ( Holten , 2004 ; Nguyen et al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ; Shamsuzzaman , Gersh , &; Somers , 2003 ; Trupp , 2004 ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . The patient wears sensors attached to the head and body to record brain waves , eye movements , muscle activity , and cardiovascular ( i.e. , pulse oximetry ) activity while sleeping overnight in the sleep laboratory ( Den Herder , van Tinteren , &; de Vries , 2005 ; Zonato et al. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apneic and hypopneic events experienced during each hour of sleep ( Den Herder el al. ; Moos et al. , 2005 ; Trupp ) . <p> Obstructive sleep apnea is diagnosed by the presence of at least five obstructive apneas , hypopneas , or both per hour while the patient is sleeping . OSA is graded into three levels of severity : mild ( AHI of =5 but &lt; 15 events per hour ) ; moderate ( AHT of 15-30 events per hour ) ; and severe ( AHI of &gt;30 events per hour ) . Research findings reveal that significant clinical sequelae occur even with mild OSA ( Den Herder et al. , 2005 ; Moos et al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . <p> Obesity hypoventilalion syndrome or Pickwickian syndrome is a complication of extreme obesity characterized by OSA , hypercapni'a , daytime hypersomnolence , arterial hypoxemia , cyanosis-induced polycythemia , respiratory acidosis , pulmonary hypertension , and right-sided heart failure ( Stocking &; Dierdorf , 2002 ; Stocking &; Miller , 2000 ) . At its extreme , there is evidence of nocturnal episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , reflecting progressive desensitization of the respiratory centers to nocturnal hypercarbia ( Macey , Macey , Woo , Keens , &; Harper , 2005 ; Stocking &; Dierdorf ) . Pathophysiology of Obstructive Sleep Apnea <p> The pathogenesis of OSA is likely to be mutifactorial . Contributing factors include airway anatomy , the state-dependent control of upper airway dilator muscles , and ventilatory stability ( Jordan et al. , 2003 ) . <p> The site of upper airway obstruction typically lies in the pharynx . The pharyngeal luminal area during inspiration reflects a balance between collapsing intrapharyngeal negative suction pressure and dilating forces provided by the pharyngeal muscles ( Den Herder et al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . In awake human subjects , the patency of the retropalatal , retroglossal , and retroepiglottic pharynx is maintained by central nervous system 's continually mediated contraction of the tensor palatini , the genioglossus , and the hyoid bone muscles , respectively . These dilator muscles oppose the negative collapsing force developed during inspiration ( Benumof , 2004 ; Den Herder et al. ; Jordan et al. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of muscle tone is typically reduced during sleep and , in many individuals , leads to compromised patency of the upper airway with turbulent airflow and snoring ( Moos ct al. , 2005 ; Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) ( see Figure 1 ) . In obese patients , more adipose tissues in the pharyngeal structures increase the likelihood that relaxation of the upper airway muscles will cause collapse of the soft-walled oropharynx between the uvula and the epiglottis . Extraluminal pressure is increased by superficially located masses and the upper airway is compressed externally ( Benumof ) . <p> Zonato et al . ( 2005 ) prospectively studied the relationship of craniofacial tissue deformities and the incidence of OSA . The anatomic changes associated with OSA include a high-arched palate and a retropositioned mandible ; altered nasal anatomy , including severe septal deviation and enlarged turbinates , and oropharyngeal soft tissue alterations , including tonsillar hypertrophy and a large tongue ( Den Herder et al. , 2005 ) , are observed to be significantly prominent in sleep apneic groups ( Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ; Zonato et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by the literature ( Benumof , 2004 ; Macey et al. , 2005 ; Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) . Marcus , Katz , Lutz , Glaster , &; Carson ( 2005 ) evaluated the upper airway response to hypercapnia during sleep among school-aged children with OSAs . The study elucidated how upper airway neuromotor activation may be diminished secondary to chronic , sleep-related hypoxemia and , alternatively , it may be because of direct vibrational damage to the upper airway nerves due to chronic snoring ( Jordan et al. , 2003 ; Marcus et al. ; Nguyen et al. , 2005 ) . Macey et al . demonstrated how deficient cerebral , cerebellar , medullary influences can diminish respiratory drive during sleep and decrease ventilatory responsiveness to hypercapnia in patients with central OSA or obstructive sleep hypopnea ( Macey et al . ) . <p> Sleep abolishes proprioceptive feedback from thoracic and upper airway receptors and suppresses chemical feedback , which increases neural output to the pharyngeal muscles . At sleep onset , all or any of these mechanical , neural , and structural factors contribute to upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jordan et al. , 2003 ; Krimsky &; Leiter , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . During airway obstruction , hypoxemia , hypercapnia , and a decrease in pH development cause a progressive increase in ventilatory drive to the respiratory pump and upper airway muscles ( Marcus el al. , 2005 ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . Any of these mechanisms , such as extreme twitching , vocalization , gasping , or snorting on airway opening , could increase neural traffic in the reticular activating system and arouse the individual . This leads to a surge of pharyngeal dilator muscle activity , and the airway opens . Hyperventilation reverses the blood gas disturbance , and correspondingly the central respiratory drive is reduced . This process can repeat itself continuously during the night , allowing intermittent hypoxia and hypercarbia , fragmenting sleep , and triggering adrenergic surges with each cycle ( see Figure 2 ) ( Benumof , 2004 ; Den Herder et al. , 2005 ; Jordan el al. ; Krimsky &; Leiter ; Moos et al. , 2005 ) . Clinical Manifestations of Obstructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diaphoresis , nocturia , reports of dry mouth , awakening with a choking sensation , nocturnal snorting , gasping , or cessation of breathing reported by the patients sleep partner . Daytime features result from sleep disruption caused by the apnea- or hypopnea-associated arousals that include daytime somnolence , morning headaches related to nocturnal carbon dioxide retention ( Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) , impaired memory and concentration , decreased dexterity and cognitive difficulties associated with fatigue , and personality changes such as irritability , anxiety , depression , and decreased libido among others ( Qureshi et al. , 2003 ; Trupp , 2004 ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . Predictors and Risk Factors <p> The following clinical features can increase the probability of OSA but are usually not sufficient by themselves to establish the diagnosis of OSA . The definitive diagnosis of OSA requires a sleep study ( Benumof , 2004 ; Den Herder el al. , 2005 ; Holten , 2004 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ; Trupp , 2004 ) . <p> Obesity , defined as a body mass index =30 kg/m or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased volume of parapharyngeal fat pads . Obesity also imposes a restrictive ventilation defect because of the weight added to the thoracic cage that exponentially decreases functional residual capacity and total lung capacity , as well as respiratory compliance and resistance ( Benumof , 2004 ; Jordan et al. , 2003 ; Trupp , 2004 ) . Sixty to ninety percent of persons with OSA are obese ( Benumof ) . <p> Gender is related to the incidence of OSA . Because of high testosterone levels , men require smaller reductions in carbon dioxide to induce apnea/hypopnea and are more prone than women to periodic oscillations in breathing ( Jordan et al. , 2003 ) . <p> Age , family history , and ethnic background are also contributory factors to the cause of OSA . The age range of 30-60 years ( Moos et al. , 2005 ) , a positive family history of OSA , and members of the African American , Pacific Islander , and Mexican American ethnic groups are all factors associated with an increased incidence of OSA ( Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including evening alcohol consumption , drug-induced sleep , chronic sleep deprivation , anesthesia , and sedative-hypnotics ( Benumof , 2004 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . Clinical Consequences of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Disorders <p> Approximately 50-60% of patients with OSA are hypertensive , and an estimated 50% of hypertensive patients have sleep apnea ( Goodfriend &; Calhoun , 2004 ; Phillips , Hedner , Berend , &; Grunstein , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study ( Young et al. , 2000 ) demonstrated a three-fold increased risk of developing new hypertension with an AHI of 15 events or greater ( Shamsuzzaman et al. , 2003 ) . A number of mechanisms can explain this finding . OSA may disturb hemodynamic stability coinciding with apneas during sleep . Apneas lead to autonomic imbalance associated with surges in sympathoadrenergic traffic , promotion of persistent sympathetic activation , alterations in baroreceptor reflex control of blood pressure , and inducing of compromised nitric oxide production that alters endothelial-mediated dilatation and arterial distensibility . Emerging evidence also supports a key role for **29;2039;TOOLONG oxidative stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further deterioration of endothelial function ( Phillips et al. ; Shamsuzzaman et al. ) thereby-increasing the risk for atherosclerosis ( Shamsuzzaman et al. ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . In addition , the increased levels of circulating norepinephrine and endothelin resulting from hypoxemia activate the complete **28;2070;TOOLONG axis that causes sodium retention and systemic vasoconstriction ( Goodfriend &; Calhoun ) . <p> Repetitive apneic events disrupt ( he normal physiologic interactions between sleep and the cardiovascular system . During apnea , inspiratory effort against a closed upper airway results in negative intrathoracic pressures reaching as low as negative 80 cm HO that may impair left ventricular ( LV ) relaxation and reduce LV preload that leads to reduction in stroke volume and cardiac output ( Shamsuzzaman et al. , 2003 ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . During resumption of breathing , the restoration of venous return may distend the right ventricle , producing an inter-ventricular septal shift to the left , thereby reducing LV compliance and LV diastolic filling . Together with severely constricted peripheral circulation , these hemodynamic changes result in systemic hypertension ( Phillips et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypertrophy , decreased myocardial oxygen delivery , and eventually myocyte cell death ( Moos et al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ; Shamsuzzaman et al. ; Trupp , 2004 ) . An increased incidence of nocturnal angina ( Benumof , 2004 ; Moos et al. , 2005 ; Trupp ) , coronary artery disease ( Qureshi et al. ) , and ST-segment changes consistent with myocardial ischemia are evident in patients with OSA ( Trupp ) . Disturbances of cardiac rhythm have been reported , representing in part the diving reflex response to hypoxia ( Ancoli-Israel et al. , 2003 ; Shamsuzzaman et al. ; Trupp ) . Heart block , atrial fibrillation ( Gami et al. , 2004 ) , and ventricular ectopy have been described , but the most common arrhythmias are vagal bradycardia and atrioventricular block ( Moos et al. ; Qureshi el al. ; Shamsuzzaman et al . ) . Similarly , the catecholamine surges , hypertension , reduction of inflammatory cytokines that affect myocardial contractility contribute to the development of systolic and diastolic dysfunction and a progressively noncompliant left ventricle that increases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan &; Bradley , 2005 ; Shamsuzzaman et al . ) . Recent data have shown that 40-50% of patients with heart failure suffer from OSA or obstructive sleep hypopnea ( Trupp ) . Moreover , elevations in pulmonary blood flow and pulmonary vasoconstriction from persistent hypoxia can lead to pulmonary hypertension ( Benumof ) , right ventricular hypertrophy , and cor pulmonale ( Morgan , Mikhail , &; Murray , 2002 ) . Pulmonary Disorders <p> Studies have demonstrated enhanced asthma severity and frequent nocturnal exacerbations in patients with asthma having concomitant OSA . The degree of nocturnal desaturation is greater in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and OSA than in those without it . The mechanism of this effect has been hypothesized to be neurologically mediated from upper airway vibration , apnea-associated hypoxemia , sleep-associated ventilation-perfusion mismatch , or inspiratory efforts against an occluded pharynx ( Nguyen et al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2005 ; Trupp , 2004 ) . Endocrine Dysfunction <p> Higher levels of fasting blood glucose , insulin , and glycosylated hemoglobin , independent of body weight , have been linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Berglund , 2004 ) . Severe OSA is accompanied by a five-fold increase in the risk of overt diabetes mellitus ( Babu , Herdegen , Fogelfeld , Shott , &; Mazzone , 2005 ; Shamsuzzaman et al. , 2003 ) . The impaired glucose tolerance may be linked to sleep deprivation , elevated epinephrine secretion , and cortisol concentration ( Nilsson et al . ) . Patients suffering from sleep apnea also develop resistance to leptin , an adipocyte-derived hormone that suppresses appetite and promotes satiety . This condition can predispose patients with OSA to metabolic dysregulation and susceptibility to weight gain ( Shamsuzzaman et al . ) . Therapeutic Strategies <p> The approach to treating OSA is multifaceted . Lifestyle modifications to obliterate the risk factors for OSA have been suggested . These suggested changes include weight loss , avoidance of sleep deprivation , and refraining from tobacco , alcohol , and use of sedative ( Holten , 2004 ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . In a selected group of patients with mild OSA and mild or no obesity , positional therapy can be used . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their heads propped up to 30-60 degrees . The position typically reduces overall apnea frequency by stabilizing the pharynx during sleep . Electrical stimulation of the upper airway , nasal dilators , and drugs such as protriptyline and mirtazapine have been evaluated for OSA treatment , but all have been unsuccessful in reducing apneas ( Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . <p> The most effective and widely used treatment for OSA is the CPAP ( Ancoli-Israel el al. , 2003 ; Babu el al. , 2005 ; Benumof , 2004 ; Holten , 2004 ; Marcus et al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al. , 2003 ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . The use of CPAP for OSA was first reported in 1981 ( Qureshi et al . ) . CPAP treats apneas-hypopneas by providing air under positive pressure through a nasal or facial mask , thus creating a pneumatic splint in the pharynx , which prevents collapse of the pharyngeal airway ( Benumof ; Moos et al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al . ) . Common side effects of CPAP include rhinorrhea , mask discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , among others . Nasal congestion and mask intolerance are the most common complaints that reduce compliance with CPAP . <p> Compliance with CPAP is likely to be higher if a patient has a significant daytime somnolence before initiation of therapy and perceives subsequent improvement with CPAP therapy ( Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . Patients with mild-to-moderate OSA who can not tolerate CPAP because of discomfort from exhaling against high pressure can be treated with the addition of a pressure " ramp " or the use of bilevel positive-pressure method . This technique prevents airway collapse by providing high pressure during inspiration and low pressure during expiration ( Qureshi et al. ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . Autotitrating CPAP was also introduced with the premise that by continuously adjusting pressure to meet the patient 's variable needs , the overall mean airway pressure will be reduced ( Holten , 2004 ; Qureshi el al . ) . These strategies would hopefully allow better tolerance and therefore better compliance with CPAP therapy . <p> Surgical approaches are more likely to be more effective for patients with OSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wide variety of procedures directed at the site of obstruction is available ( Qureshi et al. , 2003 ) . Maxillary and mandibular osteotomies and its advancement move the palate and mandible forward to create more space in the posterior airway ( Qureshi el al. ; Willard &; Dreher , 2005 ) . Hyoidthyroidpexia involves stabilization of the hyoid bone interiorly by attachment to the superior border of the thyroid cartilage . Anterior movement of the hyoid complex improves the posterior airway space and neutralizes obstruction at the tongue base ( Den Herder et al. , 2005 ) . Other surgical procedures , namely , **25;2100;TOOLONG ( UPPP ) ( Friedman et al. , 2004 ) , septoplasly , turbinoplasty , nasal polypectomy , or tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy , particularly in children ( Marcus et al. , 2005 ) , have been used to correct anatomical obstructions and relieve adequately the symptoms of sleep apnea ( Holten , 2004 ) . If all treatment modalities fail , a tracheostomy can be considered as a final therapeutic option , especially in patients with morbid obesity having severe OSA , significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al. , 2005 ; Qureshi et al . ) . Effects of Anesthesia <p> General anesthesia depresses respiration in normal subjects , so any preexisting pulmonary dysfunction is exaggerated by it ( Stoelting &; Miller , 2000 ) . Research findings have demonstrated that after the induction of anesthesia , significant posterior displacement occurs in the soft palate , base of the tongue , and epiglottis resulting in airway occlusion ( Moos et al. , 2005 ) . A study on the influence of lung volume on upper airway collapse in humans during sleep also concluded that the increase in airway collapsibility was likely due to the decreased lung volume associated with deeper anesthesia as the end expiratory esophageal pressure was reduced with lighter planes of anesthesia ( Jordan et al. , 2003 ) . <p> All drugs that depress the central nervous system diminish the action of the pharyngeal dilator muscles and promote pharyngeal collapse in obese patients with OSAs . Commonly used drugs that demonstrated this effect include propofol , thiopental , narcotics , benzodiazepines , small doses of neuromuscular blockers , and nitrous oxide ( Benumof , 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The implications for the pathophysiology of OSA involve careful patient assessment , meticulous planning , careful execution , and evaluation of the plan during every phase of anesthesia care . Preoperative Considerations <p> As most adult obese patients with OSA are undiagnosed , it is reasonable to suggest that all adult obese patients or those who observe them while they sleep be routinely asked about nocturnal snoring or apnea , arousals , and diurnal sleepiness . The severity of these historical items correlates with the severity of sleep-study proven OSA ( Benumof , 2004 ) . Preoperative evaluation of severe OSAs as confirmed by a sleep test or extremely obese patients undergoing major surgery should attempt to assess cardiopulmonary reserve with an electrocardiogram , a chest radiograph , arterial blood gases , and pulmonary function tests ( Morgan et al. , 2002 ) . A thorough airway assessment should be performed before the induction of anesthesia . This evaluation should include temporomandibular joint function , mallampati classification , atlanto-occipital joint mobility , and thyromental distance ( Moos el al. , 2005 ; Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) . Premedication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of airway obstruction and hypoxemia ( Morgan el al . ) . Intraoperative Management <p> OSA , a short thick neck , and obesity are significantly related to difficult intubation and to each other ( Benumof , 2004 ) . Selection of the intubation technique should be based on findings of physical examination and history in relation to general anesthesia . This may include conventional induction and intubation with laryngoscopy performed in an optimal " sniffing " position before induction as well as optimal external laryngeal manipulation if the view of the larynx is poor ( Benumof ) . In some patients with marked airway pathology , awake tracheal intubation utilizing a fiberoptic bronchoscope may be recommended ( Moos et al. , 2005 ) . The low functional residual capacity associated with obesity and OSA means that rapid arterial desaturation may accompany direct laryngoscopy . This emphasizes the importance of maximizing the oxygen content in the lungs before initiating laryngoscopy and continuously monitoring oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry ( Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) . Mask ventilation must be optimally performed , with naso- or oropharyngeal airways in situ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set so that continuous airway positive pressure of 5-15 cm HO will be delivered to the pharynx ( Benumof ) . The difficult airway algorithm of the American Society of Anesthesiologists should be used for any difficulties encountered during this event . <p> In obese patients with OSA , larger fat stores provide an increased volume of distribution for lipid soluble drugs ( e.g. , benzodiazepines or narcotics ) . Thus , maintenance doses should be administered less frequently because clearance would be expected to be slower . The amount of intraoperative opioids administered has been correlated with complications during the immediate postoperative period ( Moos et al. , 2005 ) . In contrast , water-soluble drugs , such as neuromuscular blocking agents , have a much more limited volume of distribution , and maintenance doses should be based on ideal body weight to avoid over-dosing ( Moos et al . ) . Controlled ventilation of the lungs using a large tidal volume offsets decreases in oxygenation and functional residual capacity that accompany OSA and obesity and that may be accentuated by anesthesia ( Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apnea fully recover from the depressant effects of the anesthetics . Inhalational anesthetics , which attenuate ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide and abolish responses to hypoxemia , should be eliminated well in advance of extubation ( Moos et al. , 2005 ; Morgan et al. , 2002 ) . Several conditions must be present at the time of extubation . First , the patient should be fully awake , rational , oriented , and respond to commands in a clear and unambiguous manner . Second , full recovery from neuromuscular blockade is imperative as demonstrated by sustained head lift for more than five seconds and evidence of adequate vital capacity and peak inspiratory pressure . Third , a respiratory rate lower than 12-14 breaths per minute while the endotracheal tube is in situ may indicate an acceptable amount of circulating opioids . Fourth , extubation in the semiupright position minimizes the compression of the diaphragm by abdominal contents . Fifth , an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway should be in place , and application of a two-person mask ventilation should be prepared if possible . Sixth , if any difficulties were encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiberscope . If doubt exists about the ability to maintain adequate oxygenation or ventilation secondary to associated cardiopulmonary diseases , body mass index of the patient , and the severity of OSA , the patient should be left intubated for a period of postoperative mechanical ventilation ( Benumof , 2004 ; Moos et al . ) . <p> Finally , the selection of spinal or epidural anesthesia may be limited in obese patients because of obscured bony landmarks ( Shamsuzzaman et al. , 2003 ) . However , regional anesthesia is worth considering if it can be technically performed , the awake patient can tolerate the surgical position and the respiratory effects of the regional anesthetic , access to the airway is adequate , and the surgery can be quickly terminated . This technique can largely obviate the need for sedative and narcotic drugs both intra- and postoperatively ( Benumof , 2004 ) . Postoperative Care <p> Owing to the risk of opioid-induced upper airway obstruction , these patients need a monitored care environment , for example , continuous electronic and frequent visual monitoring such as heart rhythm , respiratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and apnea monitor . Supplemental oxygen should be routinely administered to decrease the likelihood of arterial hypoxemia . A 45-degree modified sitting position will unload the diaphragm and improve ventilation ( Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) . If the patient was on CPAP ( nasal or face mask ) preoperatively , CPAP should be applied at all rest times in the early post-general anesthetic period . The CPAP protects the patient with OSA against airway obstruction during sleep by pneumatically splinting the oropharynx ( Benumof , 2004 ; Moos et al. , 2005 ) . <p> Postoperative opioids must be used judiciously with constant direct observation for signs of respiratory depression . Patient-controlled analgesia is a commonly selected option for postoperative analgesia . The narcotic patient-controlled analgesia dosing should be based on ideal body weight . If possible , neuraxial opioids , for example , continuous infusion of epidural solutions containing opioids and local anesthetics , comprise an effective postoperative pain control . Supplementation with oral analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is also useful ( Stoelting &; Dierdorf , 2002 ) . <p> Research findings have demonstrated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or infection , is not higher in patients with OSA . However , the frequency with which other postoperative complications occur in patients with OSA is significantly higher than in control patients who did not have OSA . A significantly higher percentage of patients with OSA suffered serious complications or needed unplanned intensive care unit transfers compared with control patients . These complications included acute hypercapnia , with a PaCO greater than 45 ; episodic desaturations reflected by SpO 2 values less than 90% with witnessed apneic events mm Hg ; arrhythmias ; myocardial ischemia or infarction ; and delirium . The incidence of serious complications was higher in patients with OSA who were not using CPAP at home compared with OSA patients who were using CPAP at home ( Gupta el al. , 2001 ) . <p> The location of the patient postoperatively depends on the patients body mass index , AHI , severity of OSA , presence of any comorbid cardiopulmonary conditions , and postoperative narcotic requirements . When any of these factors are severe , admission to the intensive care unit or a high-acuity monitoring environment must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission to the ward may suffice . The large grey zone in between these extremes requires careful judgment ( Benumof , 2004 ; Moos et al. , 2005 ) . <p> It is important to understand that in the postoperative setting , sleep architecture is disturbed . The patient with OSA is at risk of prolonged apnea during sleep for up to one week in the postoperative period . Increased analgesic requirements from surgical trauma during the first three days after surgery incur a life-threatening apnea from drug-induced sleep . The next few days are marked by rebounds in rapid eye movement sleep , which was deprived during the early postoperative period , and increases the danger of a detrimental natural deep sleep-induced apnea ( Benumof , 2004 ) ( Box 1 ) . Conclusion <p> Obstructive sleep apnea presents a formidable challenge throughout the perioperative period . It frequently coexists undiagnosed in patients with cardiovascular disease and may be implicated in eliciting cardiac and vascular damage that potentiates disastrous effects throughout all phases of anesthesia care . The epidemic of obesity speaks to the likelihood of a dramatic increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to tracheal intubation and extubation mainly related to the increased risk of pharyngeal collapse , as well as in providing satisfactory and safe postoperative analgesia . It is then imperative that the perioperative team be fully aware of the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of OSA and that thorough planning and preparation be employed in the perioperative period to obviate major negative outcomes resulting from upper airway obstruction of sleep apnea patients .
