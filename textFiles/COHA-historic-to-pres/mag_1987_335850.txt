There was chokingly sweet carrot butter , which the manufacturer claimed makes men think " they have died and gone to heaven . " Also sour-sweet and metallic- tasting salad dressings " designed " by Gloria Vanderbilt and fool-the-eye chocolate Buffalo chicken wings packed with a container of blue-cheese dip . Something called Cowboy Caviar , made in California , was based on an old recipe for a Russian eggplant appetizer ; and Le Brut d'Escargot , from France , proved to be ghostly , ghastly white snail 's eggs that tasted like salty paregoric . <P> These were only a few of the specialties on the bizarre menu introduced to buyers for gourmet grocery stores at the 33rd Annual International Fancy Food and Confection Show , held last week at New York City 's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center . As the estimated 30,000 visitors shopped their way around 400,000 sq . ft. of floor space , eyeing and often sampling the wares of 729 exhibitors , it was clear that a marathon peripatetic nosh was under way . , Looking for products that will tempt big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fine impartiality , tasting almost everything they encountered en route , whether it was the finest Scottish salmon and Italy 's best Parmigiano-Reggiano or dismal Aussie Pie , which was baked and frozen Down Under , with its bland beef filling in a crust much like damp shirt cardboard . <P> Other beguilements included ham , salami , cheese and dozens of honeyed mustards , which , along with the oozing emulsions that passed for salad dressings , were the most characteristic products of the show . Many tasters found la dolce vita by way of ricotta-filled pastry by the Cannoli Factory , and most headed for the booth of Paron Chocolatier to see the first-prize winner among new products ( awarded by the show 's sponsor , the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade ) . A visit to Paron meant risking sugar shock because the blue-ribbon concoction turned out to be Eve 's Revenge , an obscene and hefty perversion consisting of a Washington State apple thickly coated with caramel and chocolate and encrustations of coconut or nuts . <P> There were many displays offering salads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " homemade " salad bars . Ca n't Budge Fudge zapped peanut butter with chocolate for a truly throat-clutching effect , and the Beverly Hills Confection Collection dished up samples of brittle with rancid- tasting peanuts . Everywhere were products for the health- and diet- conscious : " lo " in salt , sugar , calories and fat , and " lite , " meaning anything one wanted it to . Sweet , as usual , seemed to be the top flavor . Perhaps as Americans give up salt , they reach for sugar , figuring that one gritty white seasoning is as good as another .
