" Mmmm , I wan na be the cream in the middle of that chocolate . " Kanika soaked up all six feet , 4 inches of Tyrell standing at the other end of the bar . " Girl , you know you ca n't even handle that grown-ass nigga . Plus , he roll wit ' ya mama 's man and you know he into some real shit out there , " Peaches said as she slurped her drink . They watched Andre try to talk to two women standing near the dance floor . With the quickness they both dismissed him at the same time . Kanika and Peaches cracked up laughing . " Andre could n't catch a woman wit ' a ten-million-dollar NBA contract . " Kanika laughed as she watched her former classmate kick game to another girl against the wall at Crystal Palace . Tonight was a celebration of Kanika 's mother , Waleema , and the " business " expansion of her man , Tony Black , who just took down his rival Cee-Lo and took over an extra $5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beat and wrapped her long French-manicured nails around her glass of Henny and Coke . She was well aware of all the drama that had taken place in the streets the last few weeks , and though everyone seemed footloose and fancy-free , she was on-edge . She sipped her drink and gazed at her mother , who always seemed cool under pressure , even with a 9mm in her Chanel bag . Waleema was only 105 pounds and five feet , 4 inches of rounded hips , a trim waist , melon-sized breasts , and cherry lips . Her Asian-shaped eyes gave her a sexy , mysterious look and disappeared when she smiled . With her black licorice skin , Waleema looked like an African China doll , dressed in a skin-tight black kimono-style minidress and her cornrow-braided hair cascading down herback . She sat on Tony 's lap , momentarily rubbing his bald head as she chatted with a crew of her friends , mostly other " wives " of Tony 's friends who looked up to her for her style , status , and the respect she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone 's attention was focused on Waleema 's conversation as they laughed and edged her on while she told one of her many stories . But if Waleema was the queen , Kanika was the princess . Only a few weeks away from turning eighteen , Kanika never felt more like her mother than she did now . As she watched Waleema entertain the grown folks , Kanika admired the way her mother worked a room . They both had the same features , too . Distinctive eyes , long " good hair , " and bodacious frames , except Kanika was taller at five-seven . Tony and her mother 's friends were always reminding her how she and Waleema looked alike . Sometimes people wondered why a woman like Waleema would be with a man like Tony . He was n't that good-looking , fifty pounds overweight , with a glass eye from being shot when he was sixteen , a potbelly , and acne-prone skin at forty-two . He was five feet , five inches short but had more bank than the Federal Reserve . He treated Waleema well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keeping Kanika and Waleema safe out of harm 's way . Tony had enough street cred , for coming up with some of the most notorious Harlem hustlers in the eighties , and now was the " head nigga in charge " during a time when the drug game was gasping its last breaths . But besides that , Kanika respected him as a father . His was the calming voice when she and her mother would go at it about Kanika 's coming in late from school or a party . Sometimes , when her mother could n't make some of her parent-teacher meetings , Tony would come dressed in one of his pin-striped Italian suits and have Kanika 's female teachers swooning . She often wondered if he was the reason that she got preferential treatment . He was n't a tall man , but he had a big presence when he walked into their home . Kanika understood when Tony was around everything was all good . She respected Tony most of all for taking her and her mother in when they had no place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , and traveled to New York City , they went from one friend 's house to the next . Kanika remembered nights traveling against the cold , hard winter winds , kept warm by her mother 's arms , when it was time for them to move on to the next place . Until one night Kanika remembered her mother leaving for a party with friends dressed in black and coming back in the morning dressed in white and gold . It was n't too long before Tony took them into his four-family home in Bed-Stuy , Brooklyn . Since then , he had done everything for them . He sent clients and cash to Waleema 's strip club , and she played the role of his " wifey , " making sure his home was in order , his body satisfied , and his parties beautifully hosted . Tonight was a celebration of Tony reaching the top of his game . Cee-Lo was gone , and that meant more money , more problems . But there was no time for stressin ' , as the Dom P. flowed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge area . Top neighborhood ballers dropped Benjamins like hot potatoes on bottles of Cristal and the baddest girls and their friends . Waleema and Tony danced as Waleema showed off all her latest moves to a Jay Z hit . Kanika and Peaches did the same when they took their champagne-filled glasses back to the dance floor . The DJ spun one of Biggie 's hits , " One More Chance , " and Kanika flung her hand and her drink in the air to her favorite jam . Her shapely hips swayed from side to side as she and Peaches waved their glasses in the air with everyone else . Kanika was at her best this evening : she had her family and friends around her , her mother and Tony were looking happy , and she was about to graduate from high school any day . She could n't think of anything else that would top this but a kiss from Tyrell . He was twenty-four and Tony 's number-two man . While she danced , Kanika kept her eye on him in case some other female tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some professional chick who used to roll with Cee-Lo or at least be his jump-off in between his baby mama drama . Kanika did n't know much about her , only that she was older and had a college degree and a good job at the bank . It was that job that helped Cee-Lo get loans to open his sneaker store and record label and hide his money in secret accounts . But she was n't part of " the life " like Kanika was . Kanika was born in the game , like Tyrell , and if there was any woman who knew what Tyrell needed it was her . She remembered when Tony first brought him to the house . She had only been twelve and he had been eighteen . All she could remember was this tall , black , skinny guy with eyes so deep she could swim in them . Any time he walked by , her skin erupted in goose bumps . He did n't seem to pay her scrawny twelve-year-old frame any mind , but he teased her about her Asian-looking eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they both had grown a lot since then . He was still over six feet , more muscular , and his dark , creamy black skin still made her want to lick him from head to toe . " Girl , I ca n't believe high school is ova ' . I am so tired of messing with those lil boys . " " Why are you so into older cats ? They die soon , you know , " Kanika said , bringing her hips down to the floor . She glanced at Tyrell , but there was a light-skinned , red-lipsticked woman on his arm . Kanika snapped back up . It 's that bitch . " Not that old . And any woman I see who got something got an older man . Look at your mama , " Peaches said as they danced together . Kanika tried to remember a time when Peaches was not talking about some older cat . Even when they were fourteen and in the eighth grade , she was checking for dudes out of high school . It was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the fact that Peaches ' father left before she was born . Chick was looking for daddy in the face of every older cat she had ever gotten with . At least she had Tony to fill that void . " Well , thank God you gon na be eighteen soon ; then it can be legal . " " That kind of takes the fun out of it , but I 'll live . " Peaches ' eyes stayed glued to one of Tyrell 's older friends . " Mine is only ten days away , and a bitch ca n't wait , " Kanika said , as both of the girls laughed . But Kanika was fixed on Tyrell , as he stood all close to this girl . " Excuse me , " Kanika said abruptly , as she marched off the dance floor about to make her presence known to Tyrell . " Uh-uh , where you think you going with that nasty look on your face ? " Waleema asked as she stopped her daughter cold . Waleema gripped Kanika 's shoulders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen ? " Kanika did n't want to make a big deal . " I was just going to the bathroom . " Waleema followed Kanika 's line of focus and smirked when her eyes landed on Tyrell . " Honey , do n't tell me you about to go make a fool of yourself because a man is just being a man ? " Kanika tapped her foot impatiently as she cut her eyes away from Tyrell and his female companion . Waleema gently pulled her to a dark corner , away from the music and the noise . " I get a feeling that you got something more to say to Tyrell than hello . Am I right ? " Kanika ran her hands over her wavy black weave . " Mommy , I just wanted to say hello , but he 's with that trick again , " Kanika said , frustrated with herself . She had never gotten a chance to have a real conversation with Tyrell because he would always tease her about his being locked up because of her age . She wanted to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her feelings for him . " Baby , you gon na be eighteen soon . You got ta start acting more mature . You ca n't just storm over there and interrupt the man just because . You got ta do that with class , honey . Remember , a ho in the sheets and a princess in the streets . Understand ? " " I guess so , " Kanika said , as she forced a smile . Her mother was never one to mince words . " So what do I do ? I really like Tyrell and I know he 's feeling me . " " He is , but be careful . If you want his attention , act like you do n't care if he comes or goes . Do n't you think he got enough women trying to get close to him ? Be different . Walk on right by him , " she said , emulating a sexy strut with her hands on her waist , " swinging those hips your mama gave ya , and do n't take your eyes off him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels . " And get yourself a glass of the most expensive champagne at the bar , " she said , handing Kanika a stack of bills . Kanika stood alone as Tony swept her mother back up in his arms . She thought they looked cute , the way her mother stood taller than him in her four-inch gold Chanel stilettos . Kanika stuffed the money in her Prada bra and glided her way toward Tyrell . Her heart was in her mouth as she inched up closer to him . His back was against the bar and the chick was standing between his legs . As soon as Kanika turned the corner , Tyrell 's eyes met hers . That gave her the extra confidence she needed ; her skin-tight green and gold sequined Gucci dress did the rest . She pulled the V front down some to show off her cleavage . There were lots of people passing in front of her , but she made sure she followed her mama 's rules . Kanika 's eyes zeroed in on his face with a tempting look and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . In her mind , Kanika was already swimming in their depths . She was in a trancelike state , moving in slow motion with no one around but her and Tyrell . He was dressed in all-black linen slacks and shirt with a thick platinum chain and spinning hubcap pendant dangling from his neck . The strobe lights made his tea black skin radiate with a mysterious power that made him look good enough to jump . He diminished every other man in the room with his thick , muscular build and wide shoulders . His closely shaved head and beard made him look a few years older , with a handsome ruggedness . All Kanika could think of in those few seconds was sucking on his thick , brown lips . His gaze traveled from her breasts , to her hips , to her shapely legs as she glided right by him , careful not to even give his chick any recognition . Kanika slid into a space a few stools down and ordered her glass of champagne . Tyrell winked at her and smiled . The chick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped her hand away . Kanika snickered to herself . It was only a matter of time before she got Tyrell for herself , she thought . He always acted like she was too young for him , but she planned to show him soon that she could get as nasty as he wanted her to be . Kanika walked back through the crowd to the dance floor , somewhat satisfied , to where Peaches was still carrying on with a group of other girls . " I ca n't wait to start college . As soon I get down to Atlanta , I 'm gon na regulate on all dem prissy bitches , " Peaches said out loud , and flung her weave to the other side of her face . " I 'm gon na get me an older man , and take him for all his money . " Kanika laughed at they both got back into their groove with the others . " Where you disappear to ? " Peaches asked . " I just got me a little somethin ' to wet my throat , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a sweat . " And your panties . " She laughed . " I seen Tyrell over there , too . " Kanika rolled her eyes and laughed also . It was no secret how she felt about Tyrell ; everyone knew , including Tony , who was n't too crazy about them hooking up . Tyrell was what Tony called " a young cat " and too wild for his own good , but he kept him in his crew for those very reasons . He thought that Kanika was way too smart to be with a man who made his green on the streets , even if he was steep six figures . Kanika wondered if Tony had anything to do with Tyrell keeping his distance . But Tyrell was his own man . She could n't imagine another man telling him who to date . And if her mother approved of him , Kanika thought , hooking up with him could n't be so bad . As the music changed to some eighties Prince and Cameo jams , Kanika wandered off the dance floor . When Kanika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It was a few of her classmates from school , but she wanted to be alone to find Tyrell . She turned around , looked at her diamond-studded Jacob the Jeweler watch , and said , " Listen , y'all can go and do your thang . I 'm gon na chill for a few . " Peaches said , doing a fake karate stance , " If you need anything let me know , OK ? " " I will , " Kanika said as they all walked away . She did n't know what she could possibly need . Somehow , girls liked hanging with her , because at school it bought them all the right attention from the right guys and made them look " cool . " Little did they know that Kanika had her mind on bigger things than a school reputation . She had mastered school with good grades and exceptional performances as head of her cheerleading squad and school debate team . Her mother put heavy emphasis on studying , including a mandatory three hours of studying every Sunday . Sometimes Kanika @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already aced most of it . At this point , just days away from graduation , she was ready for life 's bigger challenges . Kanika slipped away from the party . She knew where to find Tyrell and she had to talk to him . She did n't understand why he was ignoring her all night , except for his little glances . She touched herself up in the women 's bathroom and glossed her lips with cherry red color and dabbed her eyes with a touch of silver eyeliner . Her hair was still neatly styled , despite the heat and sweat . She dabbed some Vaseline , a trick her mother had shown her , on the tops of her breasts to make her skin look dewy . Her mother had taught her to always accentuate what came natural . When Kanika left , a short brown-faced girl she had never seen before slipped her a note : Tyrell is in the cigar room . Classy , sexy first .  - -  Mommy Kanika tore the note up , adjusted her dress , and thanked God for a mother like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister and that she wanted to see her with Tyrell more than anything . Perhaps Waleema knew how happy that would make Kanika , as Waleema was always looking for a way to please her . Kanika walked into the cigar room just a few doors down from the ladies ' room . She knew he had to be alone , but even if he was n't , she was still going in . " Have you seen Peaches ? " she said , slightly opening the door to the smoke-filled room . She could care less where Peaches was , but she had to play the game . " Nah , her ass probably still out there dancing , " Tyrell said , standing up and quickly opening a window . Her eyes fixated on his fat diamond T-initialed pinkie ring . " Oh , OK , " Kanika said , lingering by the door . She closed it behind her . Tyrell put out his cigar and asked , " Keeping me company ? " " I just want a place to chill ; it 's kind of noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down . Again she caught Tyrell 's eyes on her breasts , but he looked away . She carefully crossed her legs , showing the curves of her healthy thighs . She sat across from him and waited . " Yeah , I was saying that to myself . Too many fake motherfuckas out there , " he said , sipping his glass of Henny . " Half them niggas I do n't even know . " " They all our friends and Tony . " " Tony think he got friends now . Man , since that nigga Cee-Lo went down , all hell ' bout to break loose . Watch how many friends he gon na have in a few weeks . " " If you talking about Tony , you talking about all of us . " Tyrell shook his head like she did n't get it . " Listen , I just ca n't be relaxing when I know shit is hot out there right now with Cee-Lo gone . This ai n't time for celebrating ; heads about to roll . " Kanika was frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , and though she did n't admit it , she , too , was nervous when she first heard Cee-Lo was killed . But no one else seemed to care , like her mother and Tony . Everything seemed normal . " How you know all that ? That chick you was talking to earlier ? " " Man , " he said , lighting another cigar . " That trick may play dumb , but she knows a lot of shit . She told me that Cee-Lo 's people ai n't go down without a fight . Just because Cee-Lo gone do n't mean a hundred motherfuckas is gone with him , " he said , then laughed . " But their money sure is . " Tyrell passed the cigar to Kanika , who took a healthy pull . Tony had shown her how to smoke them just last year . She did n't like the taste , but she loved how she looked holding one between her fingers . As much as she wanted to believe Tyrell , she thought he was overreacting . Cee-Lo had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not too quiet , because that was when trouble was most suspected , but calm enough to know the winds had changed . Kanika was n't too worried . " So who is this Cee-Lo chick ? You fucking her ? " " Come on , Kanika . A grown-ass man like me , " he said , flashing his handsome white smile , " is not gon na be explaining his sex life to a little girl . " Kanika walked over and looked down at him as he sat on the plush leather couch . " Does this look like the body of a little girl ? " she asked , taking a drag from the cigar . Tyrell licked his lips and marinated in her curves . She blew the smoke in his face and straddled him with her legs . She sat on him , face-to-face , and touched a healed stab wound under his left jaw . Tyrell maintained a serious demeanor , keeping his body relaxed and his hands to himself . " Tyrell ? You do n't ever think about us ? Or me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them graze the edge of Tyrell 's closed mouth . The softness of her lips invited him to taste . She took his hand and placed it on the voluptuous curve of her behind and pressed her breasts into his chest . Finally , he opened his mouth , and so did she , and they kissed hard , his tongue overpowering hers . She reached down to touch below his belt , but he grabbed her hand and stopped her . He pushed her away . " Whatsup ? " Kanika said , confused and feeling silly for putting herself out there . " Yo , chill wit ' all that , Kanika , " he said angrily . " I do n't play games . And in my eyes , you will always be like my lil sista ' , " he said . He laughed uncomfortably . " Besides , Tony said your mama ai n't having it . " Kanika 's suspicion was proven . Though her mother was encouraging her to holla at Tyrell because he was a " good catch , " all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to have a little talk with her mother . Tyrell glared at Kanika , but when she stared back into his dark eyes she saw that familiar softness behind them . It spoke what his mouth would n't . He wanted her despite his tough-man talk , she thought . And she knew there was always next time . Her eighteenth birthday could n't come soon enough .
