Coal walkout would hurt miners most <P> In the days of John L. Lewis , when the United Mine Workers called a strike it sometimes seemed that a mighty union was holding the entire nation for ransom . Once again a coal strike looms-but if 165,000 U.M.W. members walk out of the pits on Dec. 7 , it will be a sign not of union power but of union weakness . The strike would be the biggest of the year , and would get President Carter 's program to increase U.S. coal production ( the aim is a 66% hike by 1985 ) off to a most inauspicious start . But the people hurt most would be the miners themselves . <P> Years of internal feuding by the insurgents who took over the union in 1972 have reduced the U.M.W. 's top leadership to a fractious clique of backbiting squabblers . President Arnold Miller , 54 , re-elected by a minority of the members last spring ( TIME , June 27 ) , has remained mired in struggles with erstwhile supporters who say that he has not shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mushroomed out of control . As a result , the U.M.W. , now negotiating in Washington with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association for a new three-year contract , finds itself unable to do the two things that any labor union must do in contract talks : speak convincingly for its entire membership , and threaten management with a crippling strike if its demands are not met . <P> The union 's negotiating package includes a substantial wage hike from the present level of $65 a day ( up to perhaps $100 ) , better safety procedures and a restoration of payments to pension funds and health programs that were stopped during past wildcat strikes . But the key demand is to make the wildcats legal . For years , U.M.W. contracts have provided grievance and arbitration procedures to settle disputes between union locals and employers . But the union claims that the mine owners cynically drag out the proceedings , knowing that if the miners walk out , it is an easy matter to get an injunction forcing them back to work . <P> Consequently , Milter insists that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each U.M.W. local the Bright , by majority vote , to strike over local issues . To the mine owners that sounds like an appeal to recognize , and even give their blessing to , a state of anarchy . Under Miller 's leadership , they point out , man-days lost because of the unauthorized strikes have more than quadrupled ; the total so far this year is 2.3 million . Most dam aging were a series of brushfire walkouts that spread from West Virginia to Kentucky and Ohio this past summer , idling many mines for eight weeks . Though Miller personally appealed to the men to go back , his pleas were ignored . Mine owners-whose negotiating team is headed by Joseph Brennan , 42 , a onetime U.M.W. official-contend that buyers are becoming reluctant to purchase U.M.W.-mined coal , because there is no assurance of continued supply . <P> The employers are in good shape to take a big strike . Since 1970 , when some 74% of the nation 's coal was mined by U.M.W. members , vast new strip mines in Wyoming and other Western states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothold , have come into production . As a result , the union 's share of national production has slumped to less than 54% . And industry has ample coal stocks on hand .
