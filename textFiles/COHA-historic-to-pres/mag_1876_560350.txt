Old Woman 's Gossip . OLD WOMAN 'S GOSSIP . XI . ALFRED TENNYSON had only just gathered his earliest laurels . My brother John gave me the first copy of his poems I ever possessed , with a prophecy of his future fame and excellence written on the fly-leaf of it . I have never ceased to exult in my possession of that copy of the first edition of those poems , which became the songs of our every day and every hour , almost ; we delighted in them and knew them by heart , and read and said them over and over again , incessantly ; they were our pictures , our music , and infinite was the scorn and indignation with which we received the slightest word of adverse criticism upon them . I remember Mrs. Milman , one evening at my father 's house , challenging me laughingly about my enthusiasm for Tennyson , and asking me if I had read a certain severely caustic and condemnatory article in the Quarterly , upon his poems . " Have you read it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I send it to you ? " " No , thank you , " said I ; " have you read the poems , may lask ? " " Icannot say that Ihave , " said she , laughing . " Oh , then , " said I ( not laughing ) , " perhaps it would be better that I should send you those ? " The article in question may have been written by Dr. Milman himself , who was then one of the principal contributors to the great Tory periodical , and he perhaps had read the poems , but apparently without much edification . It has always been incomprehensible to me how the author of those poems ever brou , ht himself to alter them , as he did , in so many instances - all ( as it seemed to me ) for the worse rather than the better . I certainly could hardly love his verses better than he did himself , but the various changes he made in them have always appeared to me cruel disfigurements of the original thoughts and expressions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand ; and his changing lines which I had thought perfect , omitting beautiful stanzas that I loved and interpolating others that I hated , and disfiguring and maiming his own exquisite creations with second thoughts ( none of which were best to me ) , has caused me to rejoice , while I mourn , over my copy of the first version of The May Queen , *Enone , The Miller 's Daughter , and all the subsequently improved poems , of which the improvements were to me desecrations . In justice to Tennyson I must add that the present generation of his readers swear by their version of his poems as we did by ours , for the same reason , - they knew it first . The early death of Arthur Hallam and the imperishable monument of love raised by Tennyson 's genius to his memory have tended to give him a preeminence among the companions of his youth which I do not think his abilities would have won for him had he lived ; though they were undoubtedly of a high order . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and countenance ; and the upper part of his face , his forehead and eyes ( perhaps in readiness for , his early translation ) , wore the angelic radiance that they still must wear in heaven . Some time or other , at some rare moments of the divine spirit 's supremacy in our souls , we all put on the heavenly face that will be ours hereafter , and for a brief lightning space our friends behold us as we shall look when this mortal has put on immortality . On Arthur Hallam 's brow and eyes this heavenly light , so fugitive on other human faces , rested habitually , as if he was thinking and seeing in heaven . Of all those very remarkable young men , John Stirling was by far the most brilliant and striking in his conversation , and the one of whose future eminence we should all of us have augured most t876. // confidently . But though his life was cut off prematurely , it was sufficiently prolonged to disprove this estimate of his powers . The extreme vividness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of latent vitality and power ; perhaps some of this lambent , flashing brightness may have been but the result of the morbid physical conditions of his existence ; like the flush on his cheek and the fire in his eye , the over stimulated and excited intellectual activity , the offspring of disease , mistaken by us for morning instead of sunset splendor , promise of future light and heat instead of prognostication of approaching darkness and decay . It certainly has always struck me as singular that Stirling , who in his life accomplished so little and left so little of the work by which men are generally pronounced to be gifted with exceptional ability , should have been the subject of two such interesting biographies as those written of him by Julius Hare and Carlyle . I think he must have been one of those persons in whom genius makes itself felt and acknowledged chiefly through the medium of personal intercourse ; a not infrequent thing , I think , with women , and perhaps men , wanting the full vigor of normal health . I suppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the power of producing it in a less evanescent form than that of spoken words , and the looks that with such organizations are more than the words themselves . Stirling 's genius was his Wesen , himself , and he could detach no portion of it that retained anything like the power and beauty one would have expected . After all , the world has twice been moved ( once intellectually and once morally ) , as never before or since , by those whose spoken words , gathered up by others , are all that remain of them . Personal influence is the strongest and the most subtle of powers , and Stirling impressed all who knew him as a man of undoubted genius ; those who never knew him will perhaps always wonder why . My life was rather sad at this time ; my brother 's failure at college was a source of disappointment and distress to my parents , and I , who admired him extremely and believed in him implicitly , was grieved at his miscarriage and his absence from England , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all . My hitherto frequent interchange of letters with my dear friend , H- 5- , had become interrupted and almost suspended by the prolonged and dangerous illness of her brother ; and I was thrown almost entirely upon myself and was finding my life monotonously dreary , when events occurred that changed its whole tenor almost suddenly , and determined my future career with less of deliberation than would probably have satisfied either my parents or myself , under less stringent circumstances . It was in the autumn of 1829 , my fat.her being then absent on a professional tour in Ireland , that my mother , coming in from walking one day , threw herself into a chair and burst into tears . She had been evidently much depressed for some time past , and I was alarmed at her distress , of which I begged her to tell me the cause . " Oh , it has come at last ! ** she answered ; " our property is to be sold . I have seen that fine building all covered with placards and bills of sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not how many hundred poor people will be turned adrift without employment ! " I believe the theatre employed re*ularly seven hundred persons in all its different departments , without reckoning the great number of what were called sul ) ernumeraries , who were hired by the night at Christmas , Easter , and on all occasions of any specially showy spectacle . Seized with a sort of terror , like the Lady of Shallott , that " the curse had come upon me , " * I comforted my mother with expressions of pity and affection , and , as soon as I left her , wrote a most urgent entreaty to my father that he would allow me to act for myself , and seek employment as a governess , so as to relieve him at once at least of the burden of my maintenance . I brought this letter to my mother and be , ged her permission to send it , to which she consented , but , as I afterwards learnt , she // wrote by the same post to my father , requesting him not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to town . The next day she asked me whether I seriously thought I had any real talent for the stage . My school-day triumphs in Racine 's Andromaque were far enough behind me , and I could only answer , with as much perplexity as good faith , that I had not the slightest idea whether I had or not . She begged me to learn some part and say it to her , that she minht form some opinion of my power ; and I chose Shakespeare 's Portia , then as now my ideal of a perfect woman - " The noble woman nobly planned , To warn , to comfort , and ' command ; The creature not too bright or good For human nature 's daily food ; For transient sorrows , simple wiles , Praise , blame , love , kisses , tears , and smiles ; ** the wise , witty woman , loving with all her soul , and submitting with all her heart to a man whom everybody but herself ( who was the best judge ) would have judged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deephearted woman , full of keen perception , of active efficiency , of wisdom prompted by love , of tenderest unselfishness , of generous ma*nauimity ; noble , simple , humble , pure ; true , dutiful , religious , and full of fun ; delightful above all others , the woman of women . Having learnt it by heart , I recited Portia to my mother , whose only comment was , " There is hardly passion enough in this part to test any tragic power . I wish you would study Juliet for me . " Study to me then , as unfortunately long afterwards , simply meant to learn by heart , which I did again , and repeated my lesson to my mother , who again heard me without any observation whatever . Meantime my father returned to town and my letter remained unanswered , and I was wondering in my mind what reply I should receive to my urgent elltreaty , when one morniun my mother told me she wished me to recite Juliet to my father ; and so in the evening I stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lesson in tragedy . They neither of them said anything beyond " Very well , - very nice , my dear , " with many kisses and caresses , from which I escaped to sit down on the stairs half - way between the drawingroom and my bedroom , and get rid of the repressed nervous fear I had struggled with while reciting , in floods of tears . A few days after this , my father told me he wished to take me to the theatre with him to try whether my voice was of sufficient strength to fill the building ; so thither I went . That strangelooking place , the stane , with its racks of pasteboard and canvas - streets , forests , banqueting-halls , and dungeons - drawn apart on either side , was empty and silent ; not a soul was stirring in the indistinct recesses of its mysterious depths , which seemed to stretch indefinitely behind me . In front , the great amphitheatre , equally empty and silent , wrapped in its gray holland covers , would have been absolutely dark hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that darted here and there from some height and distance far above me , and alighted in a sudden , vivid spot of brightness on the stage . Set down in the midst of twilight space , as it were , with only my father 's voice coming to me from where he stood hardly distinguishable in the gloom , in those poetical utterances of pathetic passion I was seized with the spirit of the thing ; my voice resounded through the great vault above and before me , and , completely carried away by the inspiration of the wonderful play , I acted Juliet as I do not believe I ever acted it again , for I had no visible Romeo , and no audience to thwart my imagination ; at least , I had no consciousness of any , though in truth I had one . In the hack of one of the private boxes , comumandin , , the stage but perfectly invisible to me , sat an old and warmly attached friend of my father 's , Major D- , a man of the world , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , an amateur actor of no mean merit , one of the members of the famous Cheltenham dramatic company , a first - rate critic in all things connected with art and literature , a refined and courtly , courteous gentleman ; the best judge , in many respects , that my father could have selected , of 1876. 713 // my capacity for my profession and my chance of success in it . Not till after the event had justified my kind old friend 's prophecy did I know that he had witnessed that morning 's performance , and joining my father at the end of it had said , " Bring her out at once ; it will he a great success . " And so three weeks from that time I was brought out , and it was a " great success . " Three weeks was not much time for preparation of any sort for such an experiment , but I had no more , to become acquainted with my fellow actors and actresses , not one of whom I had ever spoken with or seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical business , as it is called , of the stage ; how to carry myself towards the audience , which was not - but was to be - before me ; how to concert my movements with the movements of those I was acting with , so as not to impede or intercept their efforts , while giving the greatest effect of which I was capable to my own . I do not wonder , when I remember this brief apprenticeship to my profession , that Mr. Macready once said that I did not know the elements of it . Three weeks of morning rehearsals of the play at the theatre , and evening consultations at home as to colors and forms of costume , what I should wear , how my hair should be dressed , etc. , etc. , - in all which I remained absolutely passive in the hands of others , taking no part and not much interest in the matter , - ended in my mother 's putting aside all suggestions of innovation like the adoption of the real picturesque costume of mediamval Verona ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and determining in favor of the traditional stage costume for the part , which was simply a dress of plain white satin with a long train , with short sleeves and a low body ; my hair was dressed in the fashion in which I usually wore it ; a girdle of fine paste brilliants , and a small comb of the same , which held up my hair , were the only theatrical parts of the dress , which was as perfectly simple and as absolutely unlike anything Juliet ever wore as possible . Poor Mrs. Jameson made infinite protests against this decision of my mother 's , her fine artistic taste and sense of fitness being intolerably shocked by the violation of every propriety in a Juliet attired in a modern white satin ball dress amid scenery representing the streets and palaces of Verona in the fourteenth century , and all the other characters dressed with some reference to the supposed place and period of the tragedy . Visions too , no doubt , of sundry portraits of Raphael , Titian , Giorgione , Bronzino , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with suggestions , with which she plied my mother ; who , however , determined as I have said , thinking the body more than raiment , and arguing that the unincumbered use of the person and the natural grace of young arms , neck , and head , and unimpeded movement of the limbs ( all which she thought more compatible with the simple white satin dress than the picturesque medieval costume ) were points of paramount importance . My mother , though undoubtedly very anxious that I should look well , was of course far more desirous that I should act well , and judged that whatever rendered my dress most entirely subservient to my acting , and least an object of preoccupation and strange embarrassment to myself , was , under the circumstances of my total inexperience and brief period of preparation , the thing to be chosen , and I am sure that in the main she judged wisely . The mere appendage of a train - three yards of white satin - following me wherever I went was to me a new , and would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , I never knew , after the first scene of the play , what became of my train , and was greatly amused when Lady Dare told me , the next morning , that as soon as my troubles began I had snatched it up and carried it on my arm , which I did quite unconsciously , because I found something in the way of Juliet 's feet . I have often admired the consummate good sense with which , confronting a whole array of authorities , historical , artistical , insthetical , my mother stoutly 714 June , // maintained in their despite that nothing was to be adopted on the stage that was in itself ugly , ungraceful , or even curiously antiquated and singular , however correct it might be with reference to the particular period , or even to authoritative portraits of individual characters of the play . The passions , sentiments , actions , and sufferings of human beings , she argued , were the main concern of a fine drama , not the clothes they wore . I think she even preferred an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , few people appreciated , and which , if anything , rather took the attention from the acting than added to its effect , when it was really fine . She always said , when pictures and engravings were consulted , " Remember , this presents but one view of the person , and does not change its position ; how will this dress look when it walks , runs , rushes , kneels , sits down , falls , and turns its back ? " I think an ed6e was added to my mother 's keen , rational , and highly artistic sense of this matter of costume because it was the special hobby of her " favorite aversion , " Mr. E- , who had studied with great zeal and industry antiquarian questions connected with the subject of stage representations , and was perpetually suggesting to my father improvements on the old ignorant , careless system which prevailed under former managements . It is very true that , as she said , Garrick acted Macbeth in a full court suit of scarlet , - knee-breeches , powdered wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grecian Daughter in piles of powdered curls with a forest of feathers on the top of them , high-heeled shoes , and a portentous hoop ; and both made the audience believe that they looked just as they should do . But for all that , actors and actresses who were neither Garrick nor Mrs. Siddons were not less like the parts they represented by being at least dressed as they should be ; and the fine accuracy of the Shakespearean revivals of Mr. Macready and Charles Kean was in itself a great enjoyment ; nobody was even told to omit the tithing of mint and cummin , though other matters were 715 more important ; and Kean 's Othello would have been the grand performance it was , even with the advantage of Mr. Fechter 's clever and picturesque " getting up " of the play , as a frame to it ; as Mademoiselle Rachel 's wonderful fainting exclamation of " Oh , mon cher Curiace ! ** lost none of its poignant pathos , thou0h she knew how every fold of her drapery fell and rested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Criticising a portrait of herself in that scene , she said to the painter , " Ma robe ne fait pas ce ph ha ; elle fait , au contraire , celui-ci . " The artist , inclined to defend his picture , asked her how , while she was lying with her eyes shut and feigning utter insensibility , she could possibly tell anything about the plaits of her dress . " Allez-y-voir , " replied Rachel ; and the next time she played Camille , the artist was able to convince himself by more careful observation that she was right , and that there was probably no moment of the piece at which this consummate artist was not aware of the effect produced by every line and fold of the exquisite costume of which she had studied and prepared every detail as carefully as the wonderful movements of her graceful limbs , the intonations of her awful voice , and the changing expressions of her terribly beautiful countenance . In later years , after I became the directress of my own stage costumes , I adopted one for Juliet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jameson , which combined my mother 's sine qua non of simplicity with a form and fashion in keeping with the supposed period of the play . My frame of mind under the preparations that were going forward for my dThut appears to me now curious enough . Though I had found out that I could act , and had acted with a sort of frenzy of passion and entire self-forgetfulness the first time I ever uttered the wonderful conception I had undertaken to represent , my going on the stage was absolutely an act of duty and conformity to the will of my parents , stren0thened Old Woman 's aossip. // by my own conviction that I was bound to help them by every means in my power . The theatrical profession was , however , utterly distasteful to me , though acting itself , that is to say , dramatic personation , was not ; and every detail of my future vocation , from the preparations behind the scenes to the representations before the curtain , was more or less repugnant to me . Nor did custom ever render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being so devoid of enthusiasm , respect , or love for it , it is wonderful to me that I ever achieved any success in it at all . The dramatic element inherent in my organization must have been very powerful , to have enabled me without either study of or love for my profession to do anything worth anything in it . But this is the reason why , with an unusual gift and many unusual advantages for it , I did really so little ; why my performances were always uneven in themselves and perfectly unequal with each other , never complete as a whole , however striking in occasjonal parts , and never at the same level two nights together ; depending for their effect upon the state of my nerves and spirits , instead of being the result of deliberate thought and consideration , - study , in short , carefully and conscientiously applied to my work ; the permanent element which preserves the artist , however inevitably he must feel the influence of moods of mind and body , from ever being at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the exercise of my profession , that which nature gave me ; and never added the cultivation and labor requisite to produce any fine performance in the right sense of the word ; and , coming of a family of real artists , have never felt that I deserved that honorable name . A letter written at this time to Miss S- shows how comparatively small a part my approaching ordeal engrossed of my thoughts . JAMES STREET , Septem1*er 24 , 1829 . M* DEAREST H : Your letter grieved me very much , but it did not surprise me ; of your brother 's serious illness I had heard from my cousin , Horace Twiss . But is there indeed cause for the terrible anxiety you express ? I know how impossible it is to argue with the apprehensions of affection , and should have forborne this letter altogether , but that I felt very deeply your kindness in writing to me at such a time , and that I would fain assure you of my heart-felt sympathy , however unavailing it may be . To you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , perhaps , to say , " Do not despond . " Yet , dearest II- , do not despond : is there any occasion when despair is justified ? I know how lightly all soothing counsel must be held , in a case of such sorrow as yours , but among fellow-Christians such words still have some significance ; for the most unworthy of that holy profession may point unfalteringly to the only consolations adequate to the need of those far above them in every endowment of mind and heart and religious attainment . Dear II- , I hardly know how to tell you how much I feel for you , how sincerely I hope your fears may prove groundless , and how earnestly I pray that , should they prove prophetic , you may be enabled to bear the affliction , to meet which I doubt not strength will be given you . This is all I dare say ; those who love you best will hardly venture to say more . To put away entirely the idea of an evil which one may be called upon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were possible in this world where every happiness one enjoys is but a loan , the repayment of which may be exacted at the very moment , perhaps , when we are forgetting in its possession the precarious tenure by which alone it is ours . My dear father and mother have both been very unwell ; the former is a little recovered , but the latter is still in a sad state of bodily suffering and mental anxiety . Our two boys are well and happy , and I am very well and not otherwise than happy . I regret to say Mrs. Henry Siddons will leave London in a very short time ; this is a great loss to me . I owe more to her than I can ever repay ; 716 June , // for though abundant pains had been bestowed upon me previously to my going to her , it was she who cause ( l to spring whatever scattered seeds of good were in me , which almost seemed as if they had been cast into the soil in vain . My dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest period talked of for my debut is the first of October , at the opening of the theatre ; the furthest , November ; but I almost think I should prefer the nearest , for it is a very serious trial to look forward to , and I wish it were over . Juliet is to be my opening part , but not to my father 's Romeo ; there would be many objections to that ; he will do Mercutio for me . I do not enter more fully upon this because I know how few things can be of interest to you in your present state of feeling , but I wished you not to find the first notice of my entrance on the stage of life in a newspaper . God bless you , dearest H- , and grant you better hopes . Your most affectionate , FANNY . My father not acting Romeo with me deprived me of the most poetical and graceful stage lover of his day ; but the public , who had long been familiar with his rendering of the part of Romeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking that of Mercutio , which has never since been so admirably represented , and I dare affirm will never be given more perfectly . The graceful ease and airy , sparkling brilliancy of his delivery of the witty fancies of that merry gentleman , the gallant defiance of his bearing towards the enemies of his house , and his heroically pathetic and humorous death-scene were beyond description charming . He was one of the best Romeos , and incomparably the best Mercutio , that ever trod the English stage . My father was Miss O'Neill 's Romeo throughout her whole theatrical career , during which no other Juliet was tolerated by the English public . This amiable and excellent woman was always an attached friend of our family , and one day , when she was about to take leave of me at the end of a morning visit , I begged her to let my fat her have the pleasure of seeing her , and ran to his study to tell him whom I had with me . He followed me hastily to the drawingroom , and stopping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , Juliet ! " Lady Beecher ran to him and embraced him with a pretty , affectionate grace , and the scene was pathetical as well as comical , for they were both white-haired , she being considerably upwards of sixty and he of seventy years old ; but she still retained the slender elegance of her exquisite figure , and he some traces of his preeminent personal beauty . My mother had a great admiration and personal regard for Lady Beecher , and told me an anecdote of her early life which transmitted those feelings of hers to me . Lord F , eldest son of the Earl of E- , a personally and mentally attractive young man , fell desperately in love with Miss O'Neill , who was ( what the popular theatrical heroine of the day always is ) the realization of their ideal to the youth , male and female , of her time , the stage star of her contemporaries . Lord F s family had nothing to say against the character , conduct , or personal endowments of the beautiful actress who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir of their house ; but much , reasonably and rightly enough , against marriages disproportionate to such a degree as that , and the objectionable nature of the young woman 's peculiar circumstances and public calling . Both Miss O'Neill , however , and Lord F- were enough in earnest in their mutual regard to accept the test of a year 's separation and suspension of all intercourse . She remained to utter herself in Juliet to the English public , and her lover went and traveled abroad , both believing in themselves and each other . No letters or communication passed between them , but towards the end of their year of prohation vague rumors came flying to England of the life of dissipation led by the young man , and of the unworthy companions with whom he entertained the most intimate relations . After this came more explicit tales of positive entangle1876. 717 // ment with one particular person , and reports of an entire devotion to one object quite incompatible with the constancy professed and promised to his English mistress . Probably aware that every effort would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s family to detach them from each other , bound by her promise to hold no intercourse with him , but determined to take the verdict of her fate from no one but himself , Miss O%Neill obtained a brief leave of absence from her theatrical duties , went with her brother and sister to Calais , whence she traveled alone to Paris ( poor , fair Juliet ! when I think of her , not as I ever knew her , but such as I know she must then have been , no more pathetic image presents itself to my mind ) , and took effectual measures to ascertain beyond all shadow of doubt the bitter truth of the evil reports of her fickle lover 's mode of life . His devotion to one lady , the more respectable form of infidelity which must inevitably have canceled their contract of love , was not indeed true , and probably the story had been fabricated because the mere general accusation of profligacy might easily have been turned into an appeal to her mercy , as the result of reckless despondency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her circumstances might not have been hard to find who would have persuaded herself that she might overlook " all that , " reclaim her lover , and be an earl 's wife . Miss O'Neill rejoined her family at Calais , wrote to Lord F-ps father , the Earl of E , her final and irrevocable rejection of his son 's suit , fell ill of love and sorrow , and lay for some space between life and death for the sake of her unworthy lover , rallied bravely , recovered , resumed her work , - her sway over thousands of human hearts , - and , after lapse of healing and forgiving and forgetting time , married Sir William Wrixon Beecher . The peculiar excellence of her acting lay in the expression of pathos , sorrow , ' anguish , - the sentimental and suffering element of tragedy . She was expressly devised for a representative victim ; she had , too , a rare endowment for her especial range of characters , in an easily-excited , superficial sensibility , which caused her to cry , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and enabled her to exercise the ( to most men ) irresistible influence of ' a beautiful woman in tears . The power ( or weakness ) of abundant weeping without disfigurement is an attribute of deficient rather than excessive feeling . In such persons the tears are poured from their crystal cups without muscular distortion of the rest of the face . In proportion to the violence or depth of emotion , and the acute or profound sensibility of the temperament , is the disturbance of the countenance . In sensitive organizations the muscles round the nostrils and lips quiver and are distorted , the throat and temples swell , and a * , rimace , which but for its miserable significance would be grotesque , convulses the whole face . Men 's tears always seem to me as if they were pumped up from their heels and strained through every drop of blood in their veins ; women 's , to start as under a knife stroke , direct with a gush from their heart , abundant and beneficent ; but again , women of the temperament I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lovely eyes , and their weeping , which is indescribably beautiful , is comparatively painless , and yet pathetic enough to challenge tender compassion . I have twice seen such tears shed , and never forgotten them : once from heaven - blue eyes , and the face looked like a flower with pearly dewdrops sliding over it ; and again , once from magnificent , dark , uplifted orbs , from which the falling tears looked like diamond rain-drops by moonlight . Miss O'Neill was a supremely touching but neither a powerful nor a passionate actress . Personally she was the very beau ideal of feminine weakness in its most attractive form , - delicacy . She was tall , slender , elegantly formed , and extremely graceful ; her features were regular and finely chiseled , and her hair beautiful ; her eyes were too li* , ht , and her eyebrows and eyelashes too pale for expression ; her voice wanted variety and 718 June , // brilliancy for comic intonation , but was deep and sonorous , and of a fine pathetic and tragic quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , and in the emergency my father and mother even thought of my brother Henry 's trying the part . He was in the first bloom of youth , and really might be called beautiful ; and certainly , a few years later , might have been the very ideal of a Romeo . But he looked too young for the part , as in ( leed he was , being three years my junior . The overwhelming objection , however , was his own insuperable dislike to the idea of acting , and his ludicrous incapacity for assuming the faintest appearance of any sentiment . However , he learnt the words , and never shall I forget the expYosion of laughter which shook my father , my mother , and myself , when , after hearing him recite the balcony scene with the most indescribable mixture of shy terror and nervous convulsions of suppressed gig* , liug , my father threw down the books , and Henry gave vent to his feelings by clapping his elbows against his sides and bursting into a series of triumphant cock-crows - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sweet , sentimental face , and the part he had just been pretending to assume , that I thought we never should have recovered from the fits it sent us into . We were literally all cryin , , with lau0hter , and a more farcical scene can not be imagined . This of course ended all idea of that young chanticleer being my Romeo ; and yet the young rascal was , or fancied he was , over head and ears in love at this very time , and an exquisite sketch Hayter had just made of him might with the utmost propriety have been sent to the exhibition with no other title than Portrait of a Lover . The part of Romeo was given to Mr. Abbot , an old-established favorite with the public , a very amiable and worthy man , old enough to have been my father , whose performance , not certainly of the highest order , was nevertheless not below inoffensive mediocrity . But the public , who were bent upon doing more than justice to me , were less than 719 just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially by my more enthusiastic admirers of the male sex , might , I should think , have embittered his stage relations with me to the point of making me an object of detestation to him , all through our theatrical loves . A tragi-comic incident was related to me by one of the parties concerned in it , which certainly proved that poor Mr. Abbot was quite aware of the little favor his Romeo found with my particular friends . One of them , the son of our kind and valued friends , the G-s , an excellent , good-hearted , but not very wise young fellow , invariably occupied a certain favorite and . favorable position in the midst of the third row of the pit every night that I acted . There were no stalls or reserved seats then , though not lou0 after I came out the majority of the seats in the orchestra were let to spectators and generally occupied by a set of young gentlemen whom Sir Thomas Lawrence always designated as my " body guard . " This , however , had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait long hours and even to fight for the privilege of his peculiar seat , where he rendered himself , I am sorry to say , not a little ludicrous , and not seldom rather obnoxious to everybody in his vicinity , by the vehement demonstrations of his enthusiasm : his frantic cries of " bravo , " his furious applause , and his irrepressible exclamations of ecstasy and agony during the whole play . He became as familiar to the public as the stage lamps themselves , and some of his immediate neighbors complained rather bitterly of the incessant din and clatter of his approbation , and the bruises , thumps , contusions , and constant fears which his lively sentiments inflicted upon them . This fanatico of mine , walking home from the theatre one night with two other like-minded individuals , indulged himself in obstreperous abuse of poor Mr. Abbot , in which he was heartily joined by his companions . Towards Cavendish Square the broad , quiet streets rang with the uproarious mirth with which they recapitulated his " damnable faces , " " strange Old IYoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and une , ainly deportment ; imitation followed imitation of the poor actor 's peculiar declamation , and the night became noisy with the shouts of mingled derision and execration of his critics ; when suddenas they came to a gas - light at the corner of a crossing , a solitary figure which had been preceding them , without possibility of escape , down the long avenue of Harley Street , where Glived , turned abruptly round and confronted them with Mr. Abbot 's peculiarly unimpressive countenance . " Gentlemen , " he said , " no one can be more aware than myself of the defects of my performance of Romeo , no one more conscious of its entire unworthiuess of Miss Kemble 's Juliet ; but all I can say is that I do not act the part by my own choice , and shall be delighted to resign it to either of you who may feel more capable than I am of doing it justice . " The young gentlemen , though admiring me " not wisely , but too well , " were good-hearted fellows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Abbot 's rebuke , and shocked at having unintentionally wounded the feelings of a person who ( except as Romeo ) was every way deserving of their respect . Of course they could not swallow all their foolish words , and Abbot bowed and was gone before they could stutter an apology . I have no doubt that his next appearance as Romeo was bailed with some very cordial remorseful applause , addressed to him personally as some relief to their feelings , by my indiscreet partisans . My friend G , not very long after this theatrical passion of his , became what is sometimes called " religious , " and bad thoughts of going into the church and giving up the play-house . He confided to my mother , who was his mother 's intimate friend , and of whom he was very fond , his conscientious scruples , which she in no wise combated ; though she probably thought more moderation in going to the theatre , and a little more self-control when there , might not in any event be undesirable changes in his practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was then his principal pleasure , or not . One night when the venerable Prebend of St. Paul 's , her old friend , Dr. Hughes , was in her box with her , witnessing my performance ( which my mother never failed to attend ) , she pointed out G scrimmaging about , as usual , in his wonted place in the pit , and said , " There is a poor lad who is terribly disturbed in his mind about the very thing he is doing at this moment . He is thinkin* of going into the church , and more than half believes that be ought to give up coining to the play . " " That depends , I should say , " replied dear old Dr. Hughes , " upon his own conviction in the matter , and nothing else ; meantime , pray give him my compliments , and tell him I have enjoyed the performance tonight extremely . " Mr. Abbot was in truth not a bad actor , though a perfectly uninteresting one in tragedy ; he had a good figure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-bred person , and , in what is called genteel comedy , precisely the air and manner which is most difficult to assume , that of a gentleman . He had been in the army and had left it for the stage , where his performances were always respectable , though seldom anything more . Wantin* passion and expression in tragedy , he naturally resorted to vehemence to supply their place , and was exaggerated and violent from the absence of all dramatic feeling and imagination . Moreover , in moments of powerful emotion he was apt to become unsteady on his legs , and always filled me with terror lest in some of his headlong runs and rushes about the stage he should lose his balance and fall ; as indeed he once did , to my unspeakable distress , in the play of The Grecian Daughter , in which he enacted my husband , Phocion , and flying to embrace me , after a period of painful and eventful separation , he completely overbalanced himself , and swinging round with me in his arms we both came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was all I could ejaculate ; he , poor man , literally pale green with dismay , picked me up in profound silence , and the au 720 June , // dience kindly covered our confusion and comforted us by vehement applause , not , indeed , unmixed with laughter . But my friends and admirers were none the more his after that exploit ; and I remained in mortal dread of his stage-embraces forever after , steadying myself carefully on my feet , and bracing my whole figure to " stand fast , " whenever he made the smallest affectionate approach towards me . It is not often that such a piece of awkwardness as this is perpetrated on the stage , but dramatic heroines are nevertheless liable to sundry disagreeable difficulties of a very unromantic nature . If a gentleman in a ballroom places his hand round a lady 's waist to waltz with her , she can ; without any shock to the " situation , ** beg him to release the end spray of her flowery garland , or the floating ribbons of her head-dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a scene of tragedy grief or horror , of the unreality of which by dint of the effort of your imagination you are no longer conscious , to be obliged to say , in your distraction , to your distracted partner in woe , " Please lift your arm from my waist , you are pulling my head down backwards , " is a distraction too , of its kind . The only occasion on which I ever acted Juliet to a Romeo who looked the part was one when Miss Ellen Tree sustained it . The acting of Romeo or any other man 's part by a woman ( in spite of Mrs. Siddons 's Hamlet ) , is , in my judgment , contrary to every artistic and perhaps natural propriety , but I can not deny that the stature " more than common tall , " and the beautiful face , of which the fine features were too marked in their classical regularity to look feeble or even effeminate , of my fair female lover made her physically an appropriate representative of Romeo . Miss Ellen Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broad - shouldered as well as tall , and her long limbs had the fine proportions of the huntress Diana ; altogether , she made a very " pretty fellow , " as the saying was formerly , as all who saw her in her graceful perVOL . XXXVII. - NO. 224. 46 formance of Talfourd 's Ion will testify ; but assumption of that character , which in its ideal classical purity is almost without sex , was less open to objection than that of the fighting young Veronese noble of the fourteenth century . She fenced very well , however , and acquitted herself quite manfully in her duel with Tybalt ; the only hitch in the usual " business " of the part was between herself and me , and I do not imagine the public , for one ni0ht , were much aggrieved by the omission of the usual clap - trap performance ( part of Garrick 's interpolation , which indeed belongs to the original story , but which Shakespeare 's true poet 's sense had dis . carded ) of Romeo 's plucking Juliet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff and motionless in her death trance , down to the foot-lights . This feat Miss Tree insisted upon attempting with me , and I as stoutly resisted all her entreaties to let her do so . I was a very slenderlooking girl , but very heavy for all that . ( A friend of mine , on my first voyage to America , lifting me from a small height , set me down upon the deck exclaiming , " Oh , you solid little lady ! " and my cousin , John Mason , the first time he acted Romeo with me , though a very powerful , muscular young man , whispered to me as he carried my corpse down the stage with a fine semblance of frenzy , " Jove , Fanny , you are a lift ! " ) Finding that all argument and remonstrance was unavailing , and that Miss Tree , though by no means other than a good friend and fellow - worker of mine , was bent upon performing this gymnastic feat , I said at last , " If you attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will kick and scream till you set me down , " which ended the controversy . I do not know whether she believed me , but she did not venture upon the experiment . I considerthat I was quite justified in using even this naughty child 's threat to prevent Miss Tree from doing what might very well have ended in some dangerous and ludicrous accident ; nor did I feel at all guilty towards her of the species of malice prepense which 18Th. 721 // Malibran exhibited towards Sontag , when they sang in the opera of Romeo and Juliet on the first occasion of their appearing together during their brilliant public career in England . Malibran ' s mischievousness partook of the force and versatility of her extraordinary genius , and having tormented poor Mademoiselle Sontag with every inconceivable freak and caprice during the whole rehearsal of the opera , at length , when requested by her to say in what part of the stage she intended to fall in the last scene , she , Malibran , replied that she " really did n't know , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " died in one place , sometimes in another , just as it happened , or the humor took her at the moment . " As Sontag was bound to expire in loving proximity to her , and was , I take it , much less liable to spontaneous inspiration than her fiery rival , this was by no means satisfactory . She had nothing like the original genius of the other woman , but was nevertheless a more perfect artist . Wanting weight and power and passion for such parts as Norma , Medea , Semiramide , etc. , she was perfect in the teaderer and more pathetic parts of Amina , Lucia di Lammermoor , Linda di Chamouni ; exquisite in the Rosina and Carolina of the Barbiere and Matrimonio Segreto ; and , in my opinion , quite unrivaled in her Countess , in the Nozze , and indeed in all rendering of Mozart 's music , to whose peculiar and preeminent genius hers seemed to me in some degree allied , and of whose works she was the only interpreter I ever heard , gifted alike with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of rendering it . Her mode of utterm sound , of putting forth her voice ( the test which all but Italians or most carefully Italian-trained singers fail in ) , was as purely unteutonic as possible . She was one of the most perfect singers I ever heard , and sug* ests to my memory the quaint praise of the gypsy vocal performance in the ballad of Johnny Faa : " They sang so sweet So very complete. ** She was the first Rosina I ever heard who introduced into the scene of the music-lesson Rhodes Air , with the famous violin variations , which she performed by way of a vocalise , to the utter amazement of her noble music master , I should think , as well as her audience . Mademoiselle Nilsson is the only prima donna since her day who has at all reminded me of Sontag , who was lovely to look at , delightful to listen to , good , amiable , and charming , and , compared with Malibran , like the evening star to a comet . Defeated by Malibran ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned herself to the impromptu imposed upon her , and prepared to follow her Romeo , wherever she might choose to die ; but when the evening came , Malibran contrived to die close to the footlights and in front of the curtain ; Sontag of necessity followed , and fell beside her there ; the drop came down , and there lay the two fair corpses in full view of the audience , of course unable to rise or move , till a couple of stage footmen in red plush breeches ran in to the rescue , took the dead Capulet and Monta0ue each by the shoulders , and dragged them off at the side scenes ; the Spanish woman in the heroism of her maliciousness submitting to this ignominy for the pleasure of subjecting her gentle German rival to it . Madame Malibran was always an object of the greatest interest to me , not only on account of her extraordinary genius , and great and various gifts , but because of the many details I heard of her youth from M. de la Forest , the French consul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wild and wayward but most wonderful girl , under her father 's tyrannical and harsh rule during the time they spent in the United States . He said that there was not a piece of furniture in their apartment that had not been thrown by the father at the daughter 's head , in the course of the moral and artistic training he bestowed upon her ; it is perhaps wonderful that success in either direction should have been the result of such a system ; but upon the whole the singer seems to 722 June , // have profited more than the woman from it , as might have been expected . Garcia was an incomparable artist , actor , and singer ( no such Don Giovanni has ever been heard or seen since ) , and bestowed upon all his children the finest musical education that ever made great natural gifts available to the utmost to their possessors . I suppose it was from him , too , that Marie derived with her Spanish blood the vehement , uncontrollable nature of which M. de la Forest told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said she would fly into passions of rage in which she would set her teeth in the sleeve of her silk gown , and tear and rend great pieces out of the thick texture as if it were muslin ; a test of the strength of those beautiful teeth , as well as of the fury of her passion . She then Would fall rigid on the floor , without motion , breath , pulse , or color , though not fainting , in a sort of catalepsy of rage . Her marriage with the old French merchant Malibran was speedily followed by their separation ; he went to France , leaving his divine devil of a wife in New York , and during his absence she used to write letters to him which she frequently showed to M. de la Forest , who was her intimate friend and adviser and took a paternal interest in all her affairs . These epistles often expressed so much cordial kindness and warmth of feeling towards her husband that M. de la Forest , who knew her separation from him to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent a0reement and harmonious life between them absolutely impossible , was completely puzzled by such professions towards a man with whom she was determined never to livQ , and occasionally said to her , " What do you mean ? Do you wish your husband to come here to you ? or do you contemplate going to him ? In short , what is your intention in writing with all this affection to a man from whom you have separated yourself ? " Upon this view of her epistle , which did not appear to have struck her , M. de la Forest said , she would ( instead of rewriting it ) tack on to it with the most ludicrous inconsistency a sort of revocatory codicil , in the shape of a postscript , expressing her decided desire that her husband should remain where he was , and her own explicit determination never again to enter into any more intimate relations with him than were compatible with a correspondence from opposite sides of the Atlantic , whatever personal regard or affection for him her letter might appear to express to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her act once , though I heard her sing at concerts and in private repeatedly . My only personal encounter with her took place in a curious fashion . My father and myself were acting at Manchester , and had just finished performing the parts of Mr. and Mrs. Beverley , one night , in The Gamester . On our return from the theatre , as I was slowly and in considerable exhaustion following my father up the hotel stairs , thinking less of the woes I had been feigning than of the tea and bread and butter of which they had left me in great need ; as we reached the landing by our sitting-room , a door immediately opposite to it flew open , and a lady dressed like Tilburina 's Confidante , all in white muslin , rushed out of it and fell upon my father 's breast , sobbing out hysterically , " Oh , Mr. Kembel , my deare , deare Mr. Kembel ! " This was Madame Malibran , under the effect of my father 's performance of The Gamester , which she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father ( who was old enough to have been hers , and knew her very well ) , patting her consolin0ly on the back , " Come now , my dear Madame Malibran , compose yourself ; do n't now , Marie , do n't , my dear child ! " all which was taking place on the public stair-case , while I looked on in wideeyed amazement behind . Madame Malibran , having suffered herself to be led into our room , gradually composed herself , ate her supper with us , expressed herself with much kind enthusiasm about my performance , and gave me a word of advice as to not losing any of my height ( of which I had none to spare ) 1876. 723 // by stooping , saying very amiably that , being at a disadvantage as to her own stature , she had never wasted a quarter of an inch of it . This little reflection upon her own proportions must have been meant as a panacea to my vanity for her criticism of my deportment . My person was indeed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " dumpy woman ; " but she had the figure of a nymph , and was rather above than below middle height . There was in other respects some likeness between us ; she was certainly not really handsome , but her eyes were magnificent , and her whole countenance was very striking . The first time I ever saw her sister , Madame Viardot , she was sitting with mine , who introduced me to her ; Pauline Viardot continued talking , now and then , however , stopping to look fixedly at me , and at last exclaimed , " Mais comme elle ressemble *t ma Marie ! " and one evening at a private concert in London , having arrived late , I remained standing by the folding - doors of the drawing-room , while Lablache finished a song which he had begun before I came in , at the end of which he came up to me and said , " You can not think how you frightened me , when first I saw you standing in that door-way ; you looked so absolutely like Malibran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ' *tait . " Malibran 's appearance was a memorable event in the whole musical world of Europe , throughout which her progress from capital to capital was one uninterrupted triumph ; the enthusiasm , as is general in such cases , growing with its further and wider spread , so that at Venice she was allowed , in spite of old established law and custom , to go about in a gold and crimson gondola as fine as the Bucentaur itself , instead of the floating hearses that haunt the sea - paved thoroughfares , and that did not please her gay and magnificent taste . Her dt*but in England was an absolute conquest of the nation ; and when it was shocked by the news of her untimely death , hundreds of those unsympathetic , unamsthetic , unenthusiastic English people put mourning on for the wonderfully gifted young woman snatched away in the midst of her brilliant career . Madame Malibran composed some charming songs , but her great reputation derives little of its lustre from them , - that great reputation already a mere tradition . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following harsh and ungraceful but literal translation of some of the stanzas from Alfred de Musset 's fine lament for Malibran . My poetical competitor produced an admirable version of them , and has achieved translations of other of his verses , as perfect as translations can be ; a literary feat of extraordinary difficulty with the works of so essentially national a writer , a genius so peculiarly French , as De Musset . " Oh , Maria Felicia the painter and bard Behind them , in dying , leave undying heirs . The night of oblivion their memory spares , And their great , eager souls , other action debarred , Against death , against time , having valiantly warred , Though struck down in the strife , claim its trophies as theirs . " In the iron engraved one his thought leaves en-shrined ; With a golden-sweet cadence another 's entwined Makes forever all those who shall bear it his friends . Though he died , on the canvas lives Raphael 's mind ; And from death 's darkest doom till this world of ours ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp guards the flame , so the bare , marhie halls Of the Parthenon keep , in their desolate space , The memory of Phidias enshrined in their walls . And Praxiteles ' child , the young venus , yet calls From the altar , where smiling she still holds her place , The centuries conquered , to worship her grace . " Thus from age after age , while new life they re-ceive , To rest at God 's feet the old glories are gone ; And the accents of genius their echoes still weave With the great human voice , till their speech is but one . And of thee , dead but yesterday , all thy fame leaves But a cross in the dim chapel 's , darkness , alone . " A cross and oblivion , silence , and death !

Malibran danced almost as well as she sang , and once took a principal part in a ballet . She drew and painted well , as did her sister Pauline Viardot , whose spirited caricatures of her friends and herself were admirable specimens both of likenesses and of humorous talent in delineating them . Both sisters conversed brilliantly , speaking fluently four languages , and executed the music of different nations and composers with a perception of the peculiar character of each that was extraordinary . They were mistresses of all the different schools of religious , dramatic , and national compositions , and Gluck , Jomelli , Pergolese , Bach , Ikadel , Haydn , Mozart , Rossini , Bellini , Scotch and Irish melodies , Neapolitan canzonette , and the popular airs of their own country , were all rendered by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very like that of the knife-grinder ) . When I returned to the stage , many years after I had first appeared on it , I restored the beautiful end of Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet as he wrote it ( in spite of Garrick and the original story ) , thinking it mere profanation to intrude sharp discords of piercing agony into the divine harmony of woe with which it closes . " . Thus with a ides I die , " " Thy husband in thy bosom there iies dead , " are full enough of bitter-sweet despair for the last chords of that ineffable , passionate strain ,  --  the swoon of sorrow ending that brief , palpitating ecstasy , the proper , dirge-like close to that triumphant hymn of love and youth and beauty . All the frantic rushing and tortured writhing and uproar of noisy anguish of the usual stage ending seemed utter desecration to me ; but Garrick was an actor , the first of actors , and his death scene of the lovers and ending of the play is much more theatrically effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stage excited a good deal of interest among the acquaintances and friends of my family , and occasioned a renewal of cordial relations which had formerly existed , but ceased for some time , between Sir Thomas Lawrence and my father and mother . Lawrence 's enthusiastic admiration for my uncle John and Mrs. Siddons , testified by the numerous striking portraits in which he has recorded their personal beauty and dramatic picturesqueness , led to a most intimate and close friendship between the great painter and the eminent actors , and subsequently to very painful circumstances , which estranged him for years from all our family , and forbade all renewal of the relations between himself and Mrs. Siddons which had been so cruelly interrupted . While frequenting her house upon terms of the most affectionate intimacy , he proposed to her eldest daughter , my cousin Sarah , and was accepted by her . Before long , however , he became deeply dejected , moody , restless , and evidently extremely and unaccountably wretched .

How this most extraordinary change was accomplished I know not ; but only that it took place , and that Maria Siddons became engaged to her sister 's faithless lover . To neither of them , however , was he destined ever to be united ; they were both exceedingly delicate young women , with a tendency to consumption , which was probably developed and accelerated in its progress in no small measure by all the bitterness and complicated difficulties of this disastrous double courtship .
