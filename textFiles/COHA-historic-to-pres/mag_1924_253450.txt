In London , permission for the erection of a memorial tablet to George Gordon Lord Byron , English poet , was refused by Bishop Ryle , Dean of Westminster . Wrote the Bishop to the London Times : " Byron , partly by his own openly dissolute life and partly by the influence of licentious verse , earned a world-wide reputation for immorality . Among English-speaking people , Westminster Abbey primarily stands to witness for Jesus Christ . <P> " A man who outraged the laws of our Divine Lord and whose treatment of women violated Christian principles of Purity and Honor should not be commemorated in Westminster Abbey . " <P> Among the more notable of Lord Byron 's intimates were Mrs. Spencer Smith , Lady Caroline Lamb , Lady Oxford , Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster , Claire Clairmont , Marianna Se-gati , Margarita Cogni , Countess Teresa Guiccioli . <P> In his own words , recently rediscovered by the British press , Byron would impiously say : <P> Let us have wine and women , mirth and laughter , <P> Sermons and soda-water the day after- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's a sigh to those who love me , And a smile to those who hate ; And whatsoever sky 's above me , Here 's a heart for every fate .
