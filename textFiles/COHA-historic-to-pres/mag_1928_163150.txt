While Representative Madden gasped his last ( see above ) , frantic calls went out for Representatives Sirovich ( New York ) , Summers ( Washington ) , Irwin ( Illinois ) , Fitzgerald ( Ohio ) , all of whom are physicians . Dr. Sirovich arrived first and , lacking a better remedy , applied artificial respiration to the dying man . Breath began , the pulse quickened , but not for long . In five minutes the damaged heart stopped beating . <P> Afterwards , as though in defense of his professional reputation , Dr. Sirovich said : " Had I had any medication , such as caffein , sodium benzoate , nitroglycerine , adrenalin or oxygen , I perhaps could have helped him . " <P> Dr. Sirovich also said : " I shall make it my duty when Congress convenes next week to introduce a bill insisting that every known medication which can be used instantaneously to save life shall be on the floor of the House of Representatives to be used in an emergency .
