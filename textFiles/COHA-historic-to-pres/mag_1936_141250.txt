Tiny Kent 's greatest fame comes from lettuce . Annually it produces half of Washington 's bumper crop , third largest in the U. S. Kent 's 2,000 citizens annually hold a three-day Lettuce Festival , big feature of which is the mixing of the " World 's Largest Salad . " <P> Proclaimed Queen of the Lettuce Festival last week was snub-nosed Opal Sorenson , telephone company employe . Together with two giggling high-school girls , she put on bathing suit and rubber boots , climbed into a huge wooden bowl . From two nearby trucks two pretty girls chucked tons of lettuce into an ensilage cutter . Shredded to bits , it was then blown into the bowl . Queen Sorenson added 100 gallons of ready-mixed mayonnaise . Wading in , the three girls stirred , churned , whipped , mashed . Dripping from head to foot with lettuce &; mayonnaise , they pitchforked it out to eager Kentians , for whom there is no tastier dish .                   @ @
