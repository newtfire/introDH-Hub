EVIDENCE OF LOVE by SHIRLEY ANN GRAU 240 pages . Knopf. $7.95 . <P> <P> Shirley Ann Grau is now 47 years , five novels and two short-story collections old . She is , by any reasonable standard , a successful writer . Critics generally admire her work . The Keepers of the House won a Pulitzer Prize in 1965 . Her sales chart is not dramatically craggy , but rises to a respectable plateau of long-term gains . Moreover , Grau has managed her career while raising four children as the wife of a philosophy professor in suburban New Orleans . <P> Such roots and obligations appear to have given the author a sensible attitude toward her work . She has avoided the dangers of early acclaim that might have thrust her into the footsteps of such belles of Southern lettres as Flannery O'Conner and Eudora Welty . Instead , Grau has usually played to her strength - a cautious application of talent to the Southern traditions and people she knows best . <P> Evidence of Love finds her on un familiar ground . The novel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after World War I , British East Africa , contemporary small-town Pennsylvania , Chicago and a modern retirement community on Florida 's Gulf Coast . But the three main characters seem to have less interest in place than in themselves . <P> Edward Milton Henley , born 1883 , is a cynically amusing and immensely rich businessman . He is guiltlessly dedicated to his pleasures , which include ex otic women and an occasional boy . He has had four wives but contracted with a bright , healthy Irish immigrant girl to bear his child . The result is Stephen Henley , raised in an expensive , loveless manner . Instead of following Edward 's sybaritic path , Stephen becomes a Unitarian minister and a classics scholar . He marries Lucy Roundtree Evans , a widow who has spent her sexual pas sion on her first husband . <P> The novel is neatly divided into sections in which Edward , Stephen and Lucy explore feelings and relationships . <P> The monologues allow a cross-indexing of various aspects of love : lust , friend ship , disinterested affection , good will and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated mockery of the mythical passions of a faithful Tristan . Stephen Henley , too , has anesthetized his emotions , by marrying a companion and choosing a church that prizes rationality more than faith . <P> Flimsy Sets . Lucy bridges some of the differences between father and son . <P> She is that familiar character of modern fiction , the wanderer who can in habit diverse places and situations as naturally as a hermit crab crawls into an abandoned shell . Unlike Edward , she accepts age and solitude without feeling boredom . Unlike Stephen , she can draw pleasure from watching dust motes dance in a shaft of light . <P> Grau 's excellence of craft disguises the book 's principal defect : Evidence of Love is not truly a novel but a linking of short stories . The author 's chief concern is to render her characters ' responses to intense moments of their lives - one of the working definitions of the short story of the ' 40s and ' 50s . Her far-flung locations are not textured settings but flimsy sets where the author vainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaffection.
