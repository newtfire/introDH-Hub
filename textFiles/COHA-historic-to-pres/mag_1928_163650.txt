" If anyone has-any difficulty-in hearing me-in the remotest cor-rners of this hall-do not bla-ame it on Calif-o-ornia-but bla-ame it-on Ka-ansas.City . " <P> The slow voice , a monster by itself , was amplified mechanically into a sonorous roar . A third of the grandstand seats were as yet unfilled . The shuffle of thousands of feet and the drone of thousands of excited conversations diminished slightly but by no means ceased . The voice paused a moment , and then intoned : <P> " Many ye-ears ago-I lost my hea-art-in California-but I have lost-my VOICE-in Kansas City ! " <P> This facetiousness pleased the mob . Waves of laughter lapped back against the amplifiers . The seat-hunters shuffled on , craning to see what was causing such a great sound from the platform . The sputtering , hissing Klieg searchlights played down on a tall , dark , ministerial figure grasping the high lectern with both outstretched hands . Despite the speaker 's height , his appearance was partly obscured by the three panels of aluminum microphones behind which all the convention speakers had to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . The drone of conversation died away slowly as the Voice resumed : <P> " Califo-ornia 's delegation-elected by six hundred thou-usand voters-in an uncontested pri-mary-present to you-for President of the Uni-ited States-America 's gree-eatest administrator in human welfare-Her-r-rber-r-rt Hoo-oover ! " <P> With an oratorical toss of the head , the tall , ministerial figure stepped back from the lectern like one whose duty is , for the moment , done . That was John L. McNab 's idea of how to introduce his Palo Alto , Calif. , neighbor to the country . <P> But the throng had been caught unready , unorganized , out of its seats . The growing noise lacked spontaneity . It was a rumble , then a roar . It in no way resembled an explosion . But Nominator Me Nab saw that everything was going to be all right so he left the lectern completely and walked back to stand and watch amongst the seated members of the National Committee . <P> After less than five minutes the demonstration was weakening when , to the rescue , in struggled tall young William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object some eight feet long and five feet wide . <P> " Ya-a-a-a-a-AY ! " said the crowd . It was a no less than four-times-life-size portrait of the busy-beaverish cause of the demonstration . <P> Secretary Mellon got through the jam and reached his seat , 30 minutes late . <P> In the press stand , Writer H. L. Mencken took off his coat , revealing a cocoa-colored shirt and loud suspenders . Next to Writer Mencken , Publisher Alfred A. ( " Borzoi " ) Knopf of the American Mercury climbed up on the desk and exposed several yards of film in his small cinema camera . Then , saving the film in case something else should happen , Publisher Knopf sat down again .
