Universal Pain <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> As I lay in bed suffering from a backache , my son tossed me your magazine with its cover story on backaches July 14 . I found myself in your article-slightly overweight , engaging in physical activity only in spurts , then overdoing it , and unwilling to do the exercises recommended by my doctor . <P> <P> Paul E. Kindig <P> Endwell , N. Y. <P> <P> Murray Goldstein 's comment that there is no evidence that spinal manipulation to relieve back pain is any better than singing Dixie is typical of the blinders-on approach the medical profession has toward chiropractors . After six years of pain and discomfort and four weeks out of work , I went to a chiropractor and am happy today to be able to sing Dixie and praise chiropractic care . <P> <P> John Comins <P> Rochester <P> How interesting that Dr. Bachrach 's female patients use back pain as an excuse for avoiding sex . Perhaps the reason why many middle-aged men have coronary artery disease is so they can say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife because I may have a heart attack . " <P> <P> Katherine Rubin <P> Watertown , Mass . <P> <P> Thanks for telling us that 80% of all backaches are psychological in origin . I 've been through the back problem twice in ten years , and if there 's a third time ( I do my exercises faithfully ) , I 'm going to save myself a lot of aggravation and tell everyone I 'm a manic-depressive , paranoid-schizo fetish freak with klepto-frigid tendencies , and be done with it . <P> <P> Dana Tueth Motley <P> Champaign , Ill . <P> <P> Why did n't you mention yoga as a preventive measure for back ailments ? Examine some of the ancient asanas and you will find these movements remarkably similar to the exercises recommended in your article . <P> <P> Cyndi Heller <P> Alameda , Calif . <P> <P> After 17 years of intermittent backache from a herniated disc , I have found swimming to be the only form of therapy that has kept me pain free and able to function comfortably . <P> <P> Judy McCormick <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out , you are now apparently In . <P> <P> Paul M. Lin <P> Wichita , Kans . <P> <P> The Abortion Decision <P> The Supreme Court 's decision to limit federal funding for abortions July 14 is a step in the right direction . What is needed now is a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortions for the middle-class and wealthy women as well . They are the largest destroyers of life . <P> <P> Carolyn Keogh <P> Chicago <P> So the Hyde Amendment allows federally funded abortions in case of rape or incest . Does Hyde recognize just a little that motherhood should be by choice ? <P> <P> Dan Wharton <P> Pelham , N. Y. <P> <P> Not-So-Private Lives <P> In answer to the question in Frank Trippett 's Essay July 14 , why the recent eruption in print of so-called intimacies ? Perhaps it 's because real intimacy between two people is so much harder to come by these days . <P> <P> Albert Perry <P> Westport , Conn . <P> <P> Intimacy-so longed for , so precious .
