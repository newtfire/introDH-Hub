The sweets and sours of the Administration 's sugar program <P> The retail price of sugar in the U.S. has careened between 17 and 63 per lb. during the past four years , a statistic well known to the often riled housewife . It is the cost at the supermarket that makes the headlines . But behind those prices can be multimillion-dollar battles between commercial and political rivals that escape public notoriety . And in this case there are . The very bitterness of the sugar-pricing controversy can be seen in one of the last official acts by the late Senator Hubert Humphrey , who in a statement accused the Carter Administration of " bungling and ineptitude " and acting " contrary to the expressed intent of Congress " in its sugar policies . <P> Pending before the Senate now is an international agreement that would stabilize sugar prices through voluntary limits on exports to the U.S. by foreign producers , chiefly the Philippines and the Dominican Republic . But the Senators , reflecting the anger with the President felt by Congressmen from farm states , are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy ensuring that U.S. sugar producers will not be hurt by foreign competition . <P> Sugar has been a sticky problem for Congress for years . As the world 's biggest importer ( 11 million tons a year ) , the U.S. used to control its vast imports by doling out quotas to exporting nations . That system broke down in 1974 when the price of sugar shot up , partly because of crop failures , to a record 64.5 per lb . Overproduction then sent prices dropping again . By the time Carter took office , they had fallen to about 10 per lb. , some 3 below the break-even point for domestic growers . Recalled Agriculture Secretary <P> Robert Bergland : " The sugar situation was an economic disaster . " <P> Both Bergland and the U.S. International Trade Commission urged Carter to reimpose import quotas , but the President refused , arguing reasonably enough that quotas would be too protectionist . Instead , he ordered a 2-per-lb. subsidy , which was supposed to enable efficient domestic producers to make a profit on their crops . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world prices were continuing to drop so fast that even with the subsidy they were losing money . At the same time , the major sugar-user firms , such as the Coca-Cola Co. , General Foods Corp . and Nestl Alimentana , were more than happy with Carter 's program because it kept prices low and increased their profits . <P> Many farm-state Senators and Congressmen muttered , perhaps unfairly , that Carter 's policy was chiefly intended to benefit Atlanta-based Coca-Cola , which is the nation 's biggest commercial sugar user , accounting for about 10% of annual U.S. consumption , and is headed by his longtime friend J. Paul Austin . At a Senate hearing , Louisiana Democrat Russell Long told Bergland , " I would call the existing sugar program a Coca-Cola program . " Replied White House Aide Lynn Daft : " The Coca-Cola charge is an outrage . " Still , in a July 7 memo to Carter , White House Assistant Stuart Eizenstat recommended that the President indicate his " willingness " to raise tariffs , at least to cool off Congress .
