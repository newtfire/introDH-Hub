Sadly the little man ran his eye over the cluttered warehouse yard . " The court , " he sighed , waving a hand , " of the illustrious unknown . " Foreign Ministry Official Sylva Poullin was knee-deep in statues : men of the Second Empire with pointed goatees and spiked mustaches , Third Republicans with voluptuous spade beards , poets , politicians , schoolteachers and generals , the Roman god Mars and France 's own Marianne , her bronze face pushed in . Like many more famous works of art , they had been patiently salvaged from Germany after the war by France 's conscientious Commission de Rcupration Artistique , brought back to Paris , and stored in an <P> Avenue Rapp warehouse to await the claim of their rightful owners . But now no one seemed to want them . <P> " One asks municipal authorities all over France to list carefully everything taken by the Germans , " said M. Poullin , gently kicking a bearded philosopher at his feet . " But no one lists this statue . Someone is being very silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want this statue back on its pedestal . " He sighed again . " The same goes for all these other messieurs " he continued . " No one wants them .

Now no one can remember even the names . Vanity , vanity , all is vanity . " <P> The official pointed to a general flat on his back before him . " This one , " he said , " we thought we could identify . It says on the statue ' General Dupas . ' But when we checked , it seemed that about 100 generals of the same name die each year . We never identified him . " He gazed at the general , but the general offered no clue . Nearby a mustachioed captain of colonial infantry , stern devotion to duty written all over his young face , looked up at an overweight nude ( see cut ) . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose neck , broken in transit , gave him more the look of a fey midshipman , cast a come-hither glance at a Grecian faun . <P> " Camels , " said the irritated M. Poullin suddenly , kicking aside a plaque that read LET us NEVER FORGET : 1914-1918 , " you 'd think that people would remember camels at least . <P> But we have a camel here that no one remembers , also a monument commemorating the first tunnel through the Alps .
