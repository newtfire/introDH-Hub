The Governor 's Water-Power Fight . The present clash between Governor Smith and the State Water Power Commission is no new fight . It Is pertinent to remind the People that the attempt of privilege-seeking utility corporations to use lite Constitution of the State of New York as an instrument for their exploitation schemes was thwarted solely through the efforts of Alfred E. Smith In the 1915 Constitutional Convention . Delegate Smith made the policy of govern ' meat control and operation of water power for the people 's welfare constitutionally possible . The Governor faces the present problem with a long record as a veteran conservationist . fighting the people 's battle to retain these precious natural resources for the welfare of the present and coming generations . He deals with it In his characteristic constructive fashion , with logic and knowledge , and with an absence of malice which is in striking contrast to the torrent of bluster and billingsgate that recently marked the emanations from a local source .
