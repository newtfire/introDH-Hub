THE man pointing the rifle advanced slowly down a slope of stones . He kept his aim steady , holding the firearm on his hip , and paid no attention to David Rohde 's entreaties . <p> " I 'm lost , I 'm lost , I 'm sorry , " yelled The Christian Science Monitor reporter , his hands in the air . This was a lie . Rohde knew exactly where he was , but he figured the truth - that he was an American journalist secretly searching for killing fields - would not be well received by his Bosnian Serb challenger . So he tried to look inoffensive , and made a move toward his rented Citroen . <p> It did n't work . The guard pulled the gun tight to his shoulder and sighted down the barrel . Rohde was deep inside territory he was not supposed to enter , carrying forged documents and suspicious maps , a camera filled with photos of a mass grave , and a borrowed coat on his back . A moment earlier he had been ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if he would live out the hour . <p> The guard kept coming . " Get away from the car ! " he shouted , as Rohde tried to talk to him . <p> There was nothing the reporter could do . He was now in the hands of men who considered him an enemy . For the next 10 days he would be their prisoner , hidden from the world as his family and editors worked desperately to free him . At times he would be threatened with a 10-year jail term . At times he would find comradeship amid the danger . <p> Rohde had sneaked into this forbidden region in search of evidence that Bosnian Serb soldiers had massacred thousands of helpless Muslim civilians . Ironically , this mission , once admitted , did not seem to bother his captors . At least , it did not bother them nearly as much as the scenario they seemed to consider the stronger possibility : that this strange and foolish American was a spy . <p> He was questioned for hours on end in a room three strides long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . " Mr. David , these are the three important questions , " his interrogator , Marko , said over and over again . " What is your rank ? Who is your commander in the CIA ? And what is your mission ? " <p> ' We should just shoot him ' <p> As he was marched through the dimming Balkan afternoon toward a distant guardhouse , a rifle at his back , Rohde could not guess what awaited him . He was both scared and angry at himself . He had already visited one suspected mass grave site that day , Sunday , Oct. 29 , and found grim evidence of murder : piles of coats , Muslim identity papers , a vast , newly dug field . But he was obsessed with capturing the breadth of the massacres . He 'd been told of a second suspected massacre site in the vicinity , at a dam near the village of Sahanici , and he drove there knowing that reason dictated he turn around and escape . The relative safety of Serbia itself was only minutes away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as Jupiter 's moons . <p> His captor was elderly and nervous . Except for the rifle he seemed about as threatening as a mall security guard . But he knew how to handle the gun , and after herding Rohde into the guardhouse , it became clear that he also knew how to conduct a search . He forced the journalist to kneel before him and slowly empty his pockets . The passport seemed in order ; and a forged press pass that Rohde had used to enter the area excited no suspicion . Then the guard saw Rohde 's map , a detailed , military-style photocopy with the grave sites highlighted . The situation began to go downhill . <p> The Bosnian Serb called for backup . Two teenagers - perhaps young soldiers - arrived , and Rohde could n't tell which excited them more : his map or a fist full of Deutsche marks . They found film in his socks , stuffed there as part of a backup plan that had involved abandoning the car and swimming the Drina . The American 's Serbian was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngsters had said " We should just shoot him , " and Rohde did n't like it . <p> " I 'm a journalist , I 'm a journalist , " he insisted . " I 'm just trying to take pictures of this beautiful lake and mountain . " <p> A half hour later , the police roared up , three of them . Rohde thought that maybe this was a good sign . The first 15 minutes is the most dangerous time for Western journalists taken in the world 's war zones ; once they 're delivered to higher-ups , they generally survive . Then the cops spotted Rohde 's jacket , borrowed from a friend in Sarajevo . Those small , pointed objects in a pocket on the sleeve - were they bullets ? They grabbed the journalist 's arm and began forcing the objects out , as if they were secret weapons . <p> " They 're pen caps ! They 're pen caps ! " said Rohde . The police laughed . <p> ' How stupid do you think Serbian people are ? ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " How stupid do you think Serbian people are ? " he asked . <p> The radio played its Serbian music softly in the background while David Rohde 's confidence collapsed . He 'd developed , he thought , a kind of camaraderie with the cops who had brought him to this police station in nearby Zvornik . After the shock of capture wore off , they had seemed to believe he was nothing but a stupid American sizing up the reddish , pollution-tinged lake behind the dam . But they had not let him go , and now this man in a worn leather jacket and nondescript pants was waving away his story like so much smoke . <p> His name was Marko , and he seemed to be the station 's second in command . Unfortunately , he also seemed to be a skilled investigator . <p> Communist leftovers <p> The room was an artifact from the communist era . A filing cabinet still bore a label listing it as the property of the prewar Tito regime . The door was padded , a favorite sound-deadening technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the padding burned itself into Rohde 's memory . <p> Marko began to pick Rohde 's story apart . If he was a photographer , why did he have the detailed maps ? What did the marks on the maps mean ? Why did he have tattered identity papers from Muslim refugees ? Why were those papers hidden in the pages of his rental car manual ? What was on his cassette tapes ? <p> Someone listened to the tapes . A guard came into the room - " Just music , just music , " he said . That was the last the reporter saw of his Walkman , and his recordings - bands like Green Day and Cowboy Junkies . Perhaps xylophone music was not every Serb 's favorite . <p> Still , Rohde did not break until they were leaving for the night . He was to go to a local hotel ; Marko would hold his car and his passport . As he rose , Marko said " We will develop the film tonight , and we will see , Mr. David , what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the film . Instead , there were shots of abandoned shoes , clothing , and the sad detritus of massacre sites . These pictures , developed , would prove Rohde had been lying . At the top of the stairs , he pulled Marko aside and admitted that he had been searching for mass graves . <p> " All right , you 're still going to the hotel , " Marko said , " but I want you to write out for me where you went and what you saw . Most of all , I want you to write down the names of the Muslims who told you about these massacres - and where are they now . " <p> A four-star meal ? <p> The hotel was n't bad , considering what Rohde had expected . Marko allowed him dinner in the dining room , almost as if he were a tourist . But that night he could n't sleep . He considered fleeing through the window and making for the river . But it was cold , and Rohde still hoped the whole incident would somehow be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drina tomorrow , a free man . <p> He wrote out his statement at 3 in the morning . It was a careful concoction of half-truths designed to protect his sources and himself . He made up names for Bosnian Muslims who had helped him ; the rest of his cover story was that he had learned the positions of massacre sites openly , at the end of a US official 's press conference . But it was the statement 's first line that got him in trouble : " I changed the date on my press accreditation . " <p> He 'd altered his press pass in the first place because it was unthinkable that the Bosnian Serbs would openly allow him on their territory . They had blocked all free access to the area around Srebrenica since it fell in July . Rohde had already found one possible massacre site , near the village of Nova Kosaba , in August . His story about it had earned him many enemies in Pale , the Bosnian Serbs headquarters 13 miles from Sarajevo . He admitted the forgery because he figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pale . If he admitted the truth , he did n't think the altered dates would be as large a problem . <p> He was wrong . <p> On Tuesday Marko took one look at the statement , and the espionage theme began . Only a CIA agent would forge documents in such a manner . Only a CIA agent would have Rohde 's map ; only a CIA agent would be able to read it . <p> The Monitor journalist laughed . " What , the CIA is going to send in an American in daylight , in a car with Austrian plates , a guy who does n't speak any Serbian ? " he asked . <p> It made no impression . First Marko said Rohde was CIA . Next , he was on a mission from the Muslims to blow up the dam and flood the area with polluted water . Finally , he was a NATO officer , perhaps mapping the dam as a prelude to its destruction by a bomb . <p> Rohde argued the truth : He was a journalist in search of evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarajevo on his clandestine mission , barely 24 hours earlier , he 'd thought that if his real identity and purpose were discovered he would be instantly shot . Instead Marko was looking for a larger conspiracy . <p> Near the end of the day a balding guard leaned in Rohde 's direction . He spoke a little English . " Spying is a crime . Spying is a crime , " he said , shaking his head . " You 're going to jail for 10 years . " <p> No sleep <p> As time passed , Rohde decided that his guards were an accurate cross-section of Bosnian Serb males . A majority were normal and almost friendly . They assured him he would eventually be released , let him watch dubbed 1970s Bill Cosby movies on TV in the station chief 's office , and worried whether he was cold . A minority of guards were hostile . A few - the young , balding guard among them - seemed to enjoy taunting him . <p> Early Monday evening , Marko turned to Rohde as he left for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David . We shall see . " <p> Minutes later , the balding guard told Rohde , " You are not going to sleep tonight . " He did n't smile . <p> At first the American thought he was kidding . Late that night , after losing three straight games of chess , Rohde was sitting in a chair in the office , his head beginning to nod . " Sit up ! " the bald guard growled . " You 're not going to sleep . " <p> The guard stood behind Rohde 's chair , playing with a pair of handcuffs . " Spying is a crime , " he said . <p> Rohde blew up . He loosed a stream of sarcasm in English - " Duh , like I 'm really a spy , I just drive in from Vienna in my foreign rental car , duh . " His guards just looked at each other . The balding one ordered : " Stand up . " <p> They made him stand in the middle of the room through important questions : What is your rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is your mission ? " <p> Otherwise , Marko threatened , Rohde would be turned over to a guard who Rohde thought had just asked when the American was going to be sent to a notorious Bosnian Serb prison camp . <p> It was the lowest point of Rohde 's captivity . His defenses weakened by lack of sleep and a constant dull fear , he broke down and cried . He considered admitting to espionage - but with Marko out of the room , a young guard leaned over the desk and whispered that he believed Rohde was a journalist and should n't admit to more . If not for that advice , Rohde might have given Marko what he wanted . Instead , he began to overdo his crying by blubbering on purpose . He decided it would only enhance the picture of him as a sniveling reporter , as opposed to a trained and hardened spy . <p> Boston efforts <p> Faye Bowers , Rohde 's editor at Monitor headquarters in Boston , arrived at work at 4 a.m. so she could make calls to the Balkans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , and she was becoming more worried . She 'd learned about his trip into Bosnian Serb territory from a computer message he had left her , and from one of Rohde 's friends in Sarajevo . She 'd put out feelers with the State Department and called David 's brother , Lee , in New Hampshire on Monday . So far , no one in the world seemed to know where he was . <p> Bowers called an experienced reporter in Belgrade and asked for help . She told the reporter of Rohde 's disappearance . Disconcertingly , the reporter began to cry . She knew the stories David had written , and knew the kind of people that probably had him in their grip . <p> But the reporter also promised to help . Shortly thereafter , she called back with a bit of news : The Bosnian Serbs did have Rohde , and the US Embassy in Serbia proper knew it . Immediately , Bowers called the Belgrade Embassy , where a US diplomat denied the story . " Ms. Bowers , that 's absolutely false , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's editor was terrified . She continued making calls to colleagues of Rohde in the Balkans , as well as State Department and UN officials . Other Monitor editors jumped in and began calling the International Red Cross , and anyone else they thought could help . By the end of the day , the paper 's senior staff decided to issue a press release on David 's disappearance . At this point , they decided , publicity was their best hope . <p> ' Deported ' from Bangkok <p> Back in Bosnian Serb territory , Marko and Rohde battled through the rest of the week . The reporter would stride up and down the small room , repeating his story over and over , denying that he was a CIA agent in the control of anybody . Communication was difficult , as Marko 's English was far from perfect , and Rohde 's Serbian was little better . At one point in their mental struggle , after perusing Rohde 's passport , Marko said " Ah , Mr. David , this is not the first time you have entered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Rohde asked . <p> " Right here , " said Marko , " I see here you were thrown out of Bangkok . " <p> Rohde looked at the passport stamp in question . " No , that says ' departed ' ! " he said , " Not ' deported ' ! They 're different words ! " <p> On Thursday , Marko allowed Rohde to return to the hotel for a shower . On Monday , the last time he 'd been there , the reporter had almost caught the eye of a passing international relief worker he knew . This time his guards marched him directly through the lobby into a hallway , making sure that as few people as possible saw the reporter 's return . Rohde thought this was not a good sign . No one in America knew where he was , he thought , and the Serbs wanted to keep it that way . He could be killed and his death blamed on combat , or the Muslims . <p> The shower , the first he 'd had in days , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried again . This time he was n't faking his emotion . <p> *Tomorrow : prison , then release .
