John Rankin 's Low <P> Sirs : <P> " Demagogue " John Rankin did more than hit a " new low " TIME , Feb. 14 in his attack on the soldiers ' vote bill . His sneak attack upon democracy and racial minorities is on a par with the Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor and the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia . ... A lot of good American boys , according to Rankin , have died in vain . . . . <P> ( SERVICEMAN 'S NAME WITHHELD ) <P> Tinker Field , Okla . <P> Sirs : <P> . . .

The unwholesome battle being fought over the soldiers ' vote bill in Congress is a bit nauseating to the men in the service .

I 'm proud to be one of your subscribers . <P> ARTHUR GOLDMAN Philadelphia <P> Sirs : . . Can TIME truthfully say it represents the opinion of all its readers with true impartiality as nearly as does John Rankin when he rises to make Congressional halls ring with old-fashioned Southern oratory , advocating States Rights , the poll tax , white supremacy and regard for Southern-nay , all - womanhood ? <P> Editor-Publisher The Summit Sun Summit , Miss . <P> &gt; Letters received were overwhelmingly damnatory of Mississippi 's Rankin. - ED . <P> Sirs : <P> . . .
