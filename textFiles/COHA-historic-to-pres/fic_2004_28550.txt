The Invitation " AND THAT 'S YOUR update for this Friday evening , May 23 . I 'm Olivia Ashford sitting in for Robert Marshall . " Olivia held her smile , a smile reflecting cool assurance that she was there to report the truth and nothing but . The cameraman directly in front of her signaled they were off the air and gave her a thumbs-up . " Good job , Olivia , " he said . A chorus of agreement from the rest of the crew followed the compliment . " Robert better get back from that island soon , or he might not have a job waiting for him ! " Mandy Overstreet was a young assistant producer whose smile held the same wattage as her red hair . Unlike Olivia 's , it did not reflect the polish of practice so much as spontaneity . But then she was still in the early throes of infatuation with broadcasting . Olivia had been , too , early on . Before she 'd learned that expendable was a word that loomed on her career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's Always Someone to Replace You . " Thanks , everybody . You guys make it easy . " Olivia unhooked her microphone and got up from behind the desk . " Nicely done . " Michael O'Roarke stood a few feet from the anchor platform , his arms folded across his chest , his blue gaze warm . " Thanks . " Olivia unbuttoned her suit jacket and loosened the collar of her blouse . They wound their way through a maze of desks to the long corridor that led to Olivia 's office . " Hey , we like you up there in the top spot , " Art , a senior writer for the evening news , boomed out in a Boston baritone . " Thanks , Art . Your words , though . " He grinned . " You make ' em sound good . " Inside Olivia 's office , Michael closed the door behind them . Olivia had intended to change the formal mahogany furniture in which someone else had dressed the room , but she had never gotten around to moving it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd left it , feeling the ill fit of it , as if she were borrowing someone else 's clothes . Sometimes , her whole life felt like that , as if it did n't really belong to her . " It 's yours , you know . That job is yours . " Michael sliced a hand through the air , a smile cracking his face wide open . " Is n't that jumping the gun a bit ? " Olivia laughed , raising an eyebrow . " This was my first night sitting in for him . " " But Robert 's going to retire . Everyone knows it . You 've been on the morning show for almost three years . And I 'm sorry , but people are going to like your beautiful blue-eyed self in a spot where they 're used to seeing a stiff . " " Michael - " " I know . You do n't like to talk about things before they happen . But I do n't think you can jinx this one . It 's just about as sure a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or predictable in this business , " Olivia disagreed , even though it was clear she was at least being considered for the position . Who would have thought the nearly destitute young girl who 'd answered an ad in a newspaper for the job of receptionist would ever end up here ? It had been a long climb . Michael tilted his head in reluctant agreement . " Granted . But I think it 's going to be yours if you want it . " Olivia rubbed the back of her neck where tension had unfolded and now blanketed her shoulders with clamplike intensity . " Here , let me . " Michael stepped forward to knead the knotted muscles , his touch efficient . " Wow , you are tense . " " You should do this for a living . " " Michael O'Roarke . Personal masseur , " he teased . " You 'd miss the power lunches . " " Ouch . But yeah , probably so . " As the morning show 's executive producer , Michael had hired Olivia three years ago as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them had tried a route other than friendship in the beginning . But a week skiing in Aspen had given them both a reality check . Seven straight days together had etched a convincing enough picture of why permanent was n't in the cards for them . It had taken them both a good six months to admit it was n't going to work . But miraculously , they 'd survived as friends . Good friends , really . And that was something she did n't take for granted . Before Michael , she 'd kept her life bare of serious relationships . There had been a couple of forays toward something more than casual dating , but there was always a reason to nip it in the bud . The guys were too assertive , too passive , too tall , too short , too aloof , too needy . Too something . From this , she had developed a reputation for being career-driven in each of the stations where she 'd worked . She 'd heard the labels attached to her name by some of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss North Pole . None of them exactly original , and there had been a few that did n't get anywhere near that flattering . But the reputation suited Olivia . As did being alone . At least until recently . Recently , the void in her life seemed to yawn wider with every achievement and every year that went by . She had once thought success , like ordinary old spackle , would fill the holes , heal any residual wounds and declare to the world that she was a person who had something to offer . But sometimes , mostly at night , she would wonder : Am I going to be alone for the rest of my life ? Is that what I want ? Is n't there anything more than this ? In the light of day , the panic resumed its day job as logic , and her own answer to the question was that a person could not expect to have everything . She had made work the emphasis in her life , and for the most part , it was a good life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentive hands and picked up the receiver . " Yes , Daphne ? " " There 's a woman on line three who says she went to high school with you . A Lori Morgan Peters ? Want me to take a message ? " Olivia blinked . Her lips parted , then pressed together . Lori ?
