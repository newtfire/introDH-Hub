WHAT HOLLYWOOD DOES TO WOMEN Natalie Wood , newest and brightest of the young stars , finds out how hard it is to be an actress ? and also a woman After the longest , driest , dullest spell in its history , Hollywood has at last found something to get excited about . That something is a diminutive , driving , talented , exquisitelyconstructed 23-year-old named Natalie Wood . Miss Wood has been kicking around the movie capital ever since she could talk . Between the ages of four and 21 , she appeared in 34 pictures , all of which ? except Miracle on 34th Street and Rebel Without a Cause ? were as undistinguished as her performances in them . Today she is being hailed as a new Elizabeth Taylor , the first really promising new young star in many years . How come Natalie Wood has suddenly begun to click ? How is it that an actress who was taken for granted for so long has suddenly become a star in the great Hollywood tradition ? complete with a bevy of attendants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest publicity build-up in years ? The immediate answer , but not the underlying one , is her performances in her last two pictures : Splendor in the Grass and West Side Story . The former won her an Academy nomination ; the latter a price tag of $250.000 a film , plus the right to be selective about her scripts and directors . ( Currently she is at work in the title role of the forthcoming block-buster , Gypsy , in which she will co-star with Rosalind Russell and be directed by Mervyn Le Roy . ) All this has happened to a girl who used to be considered a kind of continued on page 35 @#  | perennially mixed-up kid , with little talent for anything except getting into print . Natalie Wood- in case you have forgotten . is the girl whose romances with Nicky Hilton , James Dean , Elvis Presley. et al , were standard fan magazine fare during the ' 50s . Her much-touted marriage in 1957 to Robert Wagner fell apart in 1961 . For publicity 's sake she used to be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like leaving $12.000 in a paper bag on the seat of a movie theater . When Miss Wood finally got her highschool degree , she sent a box of cigarette butts to the Los Angeles Board of Education as a protest against not having been allowed to smoke while studying . Now all that has changed . Natalie Wood 's reach as of 1962 ? far exceeds her grasp . She is dead serious about her future , determined not only to stay at the top in Hollywood , but to become an important actress . At the same time , she has every intention of achieving a satisfying private life as a woman . If she brings it off , it will be despite the film capital , not because of it . Credit , if credit comes due , will go to her own lively intelligence ; to her capacity for hard work ; to what she learned outside of Hollywood from producer-director Elia Kazan ; and , finally , to an anonymous Los Angeles psychiatrist whom she wisely refuses to discuss . What it boils down to is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , although she 's riding high at the moment , it might well destroy her in the future . The star system does brutal things to women . This is the way it works : For every minute of a 12-hour working day , a star is followed around by a retinue of press agents , hairdressers , costume-designers , social secretaries , makeup experts ? all of whom register adoration at all times . ( After all , a star is a meal ticket . ) Not to be fooled by this kind of what's-in-it-for-me affection requires good sense and perspective . Natalie Wood has both . And she also has a quality of friendliness ? even for people who serve her . - Elia Kazan. who directed her in Splendor in the Grass and who Natage 32 alie says is responsible for her success , comments : " I do n't know anything about her private life . I just like her , that 's all . 1 think she 's a fine girl ? clean . honest . hard-working , down-to-earth , with a tremendous desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's toes if she can help it . " Kazan , however , is not so sure she can survive Hollywood . In his opinion the fact that she was " disgusted with the image " she had acquired there was what made her so receptive to his coaching . But it has been two Nears since they worked together . Subsequently she has become a star ? which is to say a very valuable property . Kazan hopes . but is not entirely convinced . that bliss Wood will be able not to become blinded by her own glitter . Another Hollywood pitfall she will have to avoid is the film capital 's preoccupation with itself . This reporter happened to be in Los Angeles on the day John Glenn orbited the continued on page 36 35  | earth . Glued to a TV set , I lost track of time , turning up late for a luncheon appointment with Natalie Wood in her apartment . The star was even later . but her secretary . Marc Crowley , a gentle and deeply self-abasing young man , was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press agent ) coffee . Next to come was Miss Wood 's hairdresser ? a woman with the approaching Academy Awards much on her mind . ( " Natalie ca n't miss . I always pick winners . " ) Miss Wood 's personal press agent arrived shortly thereafter . ( " Wait until you meet Natalie . She 's the greatest . " ) By that time we who were waiting numbered five . No one had mentioned John Glenn . At about one . Natalie Wood arrived -- fresh. beautiful , breezy , confident . wearing marvelous black velvet Capri pants and jacket , and a flaming satin blouse with matching red patent leather ankle boots ( see photograph ) I. She quickly established herself as a no-nonsense girl single-mindedl ) professional all the way . While her hairdresser worked on her hair and her secretary delivered messages and a waiter took her luncheon order , she started feeling me out to see what kind of an interview she would be in for this time . Forty-five minutes later she had found out . During lunch Miss Wood had eaten little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innumerable unsmoked cigarettes and talked fast . I had been struck with her skill at fielding questions : her choice of words she goes in for mild hipsterisms like " wild . " " blast . " and " far out " ) : and her realism about her own limitations . ( " Who am I to try to advise anyone about anything ? " ) Nonetheless , I kept wondering whether she 'd ever heard of the space program . Finally , it came out . I had asked a question about California 's lunatic political fringe . Looking puzzled . she had shrugged and said . " Politics are n't for me . Fm not the type . " Then , suddenly . her face brightened . her hand shot sky ward . " But come to think of it , " she said . " I ( lid hear they got a guy up there today . " So much for Glenn . Apparently in Natalie Wood 's corner of Hollywood there 's no time to get excited about earth orbits . People are too busy orbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that star , you need every ounce of maturity you can muster to avoid being trapped in your own circle of satellites . Here is what Natalie Wood brings to the task : First , a strong ? if unconventional moral code which hinges on her conviction that what is honest is good . Although there can be no doubt that she delivered a brilliant performance in Splendor in the Grass , the morality of the picture is highly questionable . Dealing as it does with the tragic consequence of sexual continence on the part of two adolescents . it is not a picture for children or for people who are emotionally immature . Natalie Wood defends the picture on grounds that it 's " rough " but " completely honest . " She is bothered less by the content of the so-called " sick " pictures than by the sensational way they are sometimes promoted and advertised . Even so , she prefers them to movies ( or TV shows ) which exploit violence for its own sake : The Al Capone Story . for example . or films with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second line of defense is her awareness that everyone ( including movie stars ) makes mistakes and should not be judged too harshly for them . Miss Wood has a 15-year-old sister , Lana. ( named for Lana Turner ) . who has been bitten hard by the movie bug . Lana. like many teenagers . does not always see eye to eye with her mother . Mrs. Nicholas Gurdin. a Russianborn. frustrated ballerina and Hollywood 's Number 1 expert on how to make a child into a movie actress . Natalie tends to take Lana 's side . " Sure . she wears too much eye shadow and would look better if she kept her lipstick inside her lipline . But she 's that age now . And she 's never going to learn what 's right for her unless she gets a chance to make her own mistakes . " Incidentally . Natalie Wood is kind and patient with her doting family . although she 's been running her own show -- and theirs ? ever since she was six . A third hopeful sign is her newfound determination to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something she learned from her husband ? the elegant . stealthy and well-born Robert Wagner . It appears to have been Wagner who convinced her that the kind of amthing-goes publicity she was getting could do her no good . As a result she has not given a fan magazine interview in four years . Even with representatives of the responsible press . she is very firm about what she wo n't talk about . Here in order of importance is what is taboo 1 . Her relationship with Warren Beatty ? especially- whether the plan to marry . 2 . The reasons for her separation from Robert Wagner and whether they plan a divorce . The reason seems to have been the fact that Natalie Wood was moving up farther and faster in Hollywood than he . Also . that by temperament they were too far apart ? he . too fancy , too stuffy for her : she . t .... little schooled in the art of running an elegant household . too impulsively intense to he comfortable as his wife . Then , of course . there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Her psychoanalysis . But of all Natalie Wood 's assets . her strongest is the fact that she genuinely wants to become an actress and is willing to labor tirelessly to that end . Karl Malden ? an outstanding stage as well as screen actor ? worked with her when she was 13 and is now working with her in Gypsy . He says . " Most child actresses fall by the wayside . The reason Natalie has n't is that she 's finally managed to grow up . She 's become an adult ? especially with regard to her career . It 's terribly hard to get inside a role and make it come alive for an audience , and now Natalie 's willing to make the effort to do it . W hen I first knew her she used to depend on tricks like glycerine to produce crocodile tears . Today she 'll knock herself out to make herself feel like crying and her tears will be real . ' It remains for Rosalind Russell . who will be Natalie Wood s film mother in Gypsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . she 's got a great future . " says Miss Russell . Then , rushing back to the set : " And anyway ? even if she does n't get to be Ingrid Bergman ? I wish I had such a pretty daughter . "
