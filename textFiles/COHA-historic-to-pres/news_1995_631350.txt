The Insiders ; Jack McDowell <p> 10 p.m . Saturday <p> Martyrs ' , 3855 N. Lincoln <p> Cover , $ 7 <p> ( 312 ) 404-9494 <p> There is sympathy for this devil . <p> Jack McDowell , the New York Yankee baseball pitcher , has gained recent notoriety for flipping off New York fans and teeing off on former employer Jerry Reinsdorf and the Chicago White Sox . <p> Jack McDowell , the **27;246;TOOLONG , is sincere about his pursuit of rock ' n ' roll . He can reveal a sentimental side more befitting Barry White than his surly White Sox legacy . Beneath the McDowell scowl is a compelling soul that is full of wonder and purpose . <p> Sports teaches how to harness emotion . Rock ' n ' roll is the opposite , an energetic escape from control . As one of the most accomplished pitchers in baseball ( in 1993 he won the Cy Young Award ) , McDowell finds himself between rock ' n ' roll and a hard place . <p> " I 've learned if you reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to do something else without being ridiculed , " McDowell said last month over a Cajun lunch at a downtown restaurant . " I 'm this intense person everyone sees for a few hours , and ( then they ) expect you to be that off the field . It can get frustrating . I have another side that comes out through music . What I 'm going for in music is totally pure . It 's real , probably more so than 99.9 percent of any other athlete that tries to get into music . <p> " I only envision myself in baseball for a short period of time now , " said McDowell , a free agent who turns 30 next month . " I 'm planning to do this when I 'm done , whether a couple of thousand people buy my records or more . " <p> McDowell does n't count the media among his running partners , but these days he even has the same New York-based publicist as Chicago soul swooner R. Kelly . And McDowell has agreed to talk about his new CD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. Kingsbury , Suite 203 , Chicago 60622 ) , from his latest band , Stick Figure . He came up with the name while bowling with members of the alternative band Wax . <p> " Just a Thought " features guest appearances from Smithereens bassist Mike Mesaros ; Crazy Horse bassist Billy Talbot , who plays on one track , and bassist Charles Levi of My Life With the Thrill Kill Cult . McDowell will pitch acoustic versions of his new songs Saturday night at Martyrs ' as the opening act for the Insiders . <p> Ecletic personalities are nothing new in professional sports . Bulls coach Phil Jackson is often lampooned for his deep spiritual convictions . Bulls forward Dennis Rodman has more tattoos than Lemmy of Motorhead . ( And remember , McDowell was getting his hair bleached before Rodman . ) Even Grand Ole Opry legend ; Roy Acuff was courted by the New York Yankees before he decided to pursue the fiddle . <p> Other jocks call them " flakes . " <p> They are connected by a disdain for their unconventional ways . <p> McDowell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a favorite track from " Just a Thought . " Wrapped over spiraling chord changes and soulful keyboards ( on the only track out of 12 that uses keyboards ) , McDowell 's vocal asks , " I want to know  --  is our time so well spent , that there 's no time to reinvent ? " The angst in his dense vocals are reminiscent of " Magical Mystery Tour " - era John Lennon . <p> " It 's a weird song to put out because it 's so personal , " McDowell said . " It 's about what I 'm trying to do musically  --  and all the grief I get trying to do it . This is a big part of my existence . " <p> " Just a Thought " reveals tremendous growth from McDowell 's previous projects with his first band V.I.E.W. , 1990 's " Extendagenda " and the 1992 EP " Replace the Mind . " V.I.E.W . ( the initials stood for nothing ) was a clubhouse version of the Traveling Wilburys , featuring drummer ; relief pitcher Wayne Edwards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDowell 's teammate on the Stanford University baseball team . A couple of years ago they opened some East and West Coast shows for the Smithereens . <p> " Just a Thought " is the first project McDowell has done that will be taken seriously . McDowell took the advice of his friend Eddie Vedder to be patient . ( The only photo of McDowell in the CD jacket is a black and white of the shiner he got while touring the French Quarter with Vedder . ) The V.I.E.W . recordings were done in three or four days . It took three months to record " Just a Thought . " <p> In baseball , McDowell is a fierce competitor who is blessed with the gift of deep concentration . That 's helped him in the studio . <p> " Making a record that 's not completely live  --  and no one records live records anymore , except for Uncle Tupelo 's last record  --  well , adding , subtracting and overdubbing is extremely monotonous . It takes a lot of concentration to get through something like that . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up things along the way . That ( sports ) discipline background helped me in the studio . " <p> And music has always been part of McDowell 's life . <p> He was born in Van Nuys , Calif . McDowell recalls growing up with a piano in the house . The first record he owned was by the Beach Boys . McDowell used to copy down all of the Beach Boys lyrics . <p> " My oldest brother was a huge Beatles fan , " McDowell said . " He and my sister were a generation ahead of me , so I got to hear all the ' 70s stuff growing up when they were in high school . I started guitar lessons when I was 10 or 11 . I was learning all this technical stuff , and all I wanted to do was play songs . It was frustrating . I still do n't know that much about the technicality of music . I know chords , and I know enough to relay it to someone in the studio or to someone playing . Other than after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I always wanted to play music , and there obviously was a tug of time . I put it down for a while and did n't get serious about it again until I went to college . " McDowell headed to northern California to study economics at Stanford . He wound up as a communications major , of all things . He also set the school 's career strikeout record at 337 . <p> McDowell considers himself a writer first . He zeroes in on song construction , economically slicing and dicing words into their appropriate place . He wrote the words to the celestial guitar ballad " Magneta " in 10 minutes . It was intended to be an instrumental . <p> ; ; ; McDowell keeps a note pad in his car and is sometimes influenced by ideas he hears on the radio . Recently he 's been listening to San Francisco-based American Music Club , Urge Overkill and the sonic Cleveland-based Afghan Whigs . " Their writing style reminds me of some of the things I 've done , " he said . " Especially with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of writing in airports and hotels . Next season , during off days , McDowell plans to perform occasional acoustic gigs . " Sitting around and waiting for night to come is a huge part of my life , " he said . " I bring my guitar on the road all the time . " <p> McDowell 's songwriting style has changed since the birth of his 10-month-old son , Lucas . He and wife Meridith ( who contributes backing vocals on " Just a Thought " ) have another child on the way . They still make their off-season home in Chicago but are considering relocating to Southern California . <p> McDowell saw his songwriting style evolve after the birth of Lucas . " I 've become far more personal , " he said . " I 'm not writing around my points so much anymore . I 'm more truthful . And I 'll get to the point where I have this line of records behind me and my kids will check them out . I really want it to be what I was thinking at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling . " <p> What if , one day after the millennium , Lucas approached McDowell and said , " Dad , I ca n't make up my mind between music and sports . " What would McDowell do ? He offered a thoughtful pause . " There are similar pitfalls to both , " he said . " I 'd tell him to do both . Ai n't nothing wrong with that . " <p> And then , Jack McDowell smiled . @x Of Tattoos , Teens , Tobacco The points in " Flesh , Not Canvas : Self-Expression Through Body Art Has Its Drawbacks " February 2009 about the dangers of tattoos seem exaggerated and disdainful . Bernadine Healy claims that the Food and Drug Administration " regulates food , cosmetics , and drugs with a vengeance . " I might feel better if I rely on myself rather than the FDA to oversee my tattoos . And it is rather audacious to state that " women suffer more psychological distress and tattoo stigma than do men . " Perhaps the problem is that we live in a culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stigmatizing for women than it is for men . Maybe the stigmas associated with tattoos are only the ones that your magazine seems bent on perpetuating . There is a way to protect yourself from the dangers of tattoos . It 's called thinking about your design first and doing the research on the shop that you are going to . Jacqueline Jensen Oakland , Calif . Your story about " The Amazing Teen Brain " February 2009 is proof that the minimum voting age should be raised . How about making it 25 years of age and requiring a minimum of a GED and proof of having paid FICA tax as an employee or self-employed ? Also , active-duty service in the U. S. military would qualify for voting rights . Tremendous article ! M.F. Gates El Granada , Calif . I read " Secrets of the Quitters " in the February print issue . I have a hard time understanding why a person can not just quit . I started smoking at about the age of 12 or 13 , smoked for about 35 years , then quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , if I went out to a bar at night . Around the time I quit , about 27 years ago , it was determined that smoking was harmful . I used no pills , no patches , no help . I just quit . To this day , I 've never had another cigarette , nor have I ever wanted one . The day you start smoking , people tell you it 's going to be hard to quit . After a number of years you start believing . Just step up and quit . It 's an inexpensive program . Maurice S. Haagenson Troutdale , Ore . Print Preference I read with dismay the news that U.S. News was cutting the print magazine to one issue per month Editor 's Note : " The Continuing Evolution of U.S. News , " February 2009 . As a 20-something , I get most of my information from the Internet , but there is still nothing like sitting down to enjoy a magazine or newspaper . I realize that ad revenue is down and that the future is uncertain for print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , a weekly print publication can be brought back . In the meantime , keep up the great reporting . Mike Grimm Goodfield , Ill . As a subscriber of 45 years , I am disappointed to learn that my weekly news fix will no longer be available to me in its original format . I 'm hoping the U.S. News Weekly will take the edge off my withdrawal pains . I have seen many changes to U.S. News over the years in style , print , and content as well as political leanings , and I have always been satisfied with the improvements . But this latest one that deprives me of my weekly print copy is a hard one to swallow . However , in keeping with the times , I look forward to receiving my U.S. News Weekly digital edition of the news as well as my monthly print copy of it . Keep the news coming .
