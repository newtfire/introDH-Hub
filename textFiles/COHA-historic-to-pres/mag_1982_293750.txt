And bombs fall on the Falklands as negotiators seek a way out <P> Steadily , malignantly , the ugly stain of war spread over the leaden South Atlantic last week . Sophisticated missiles streaked across the waves , while less visible but no less deadly computer-assisted torpedoes coursed through the icy waters . Before the week was over , each side had lost a proud warship to these lethal new engines of destruction . For the first time , the military forces of Britain and Argentina had mauled each other on the high seas in the bizarre battle for possession of the remote , inhospitable Falkland Islands . Then , as if stunned by the enormity of their actions , the adversaries momentarily drew apart , offering yet another opportunity for diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the crisis , which had begun with Argentina 's invasion of the desolate territory on April 2 . <P> As the fighting mounted , Secretary of State Alexander Haig , who had led the U.S. only days before from the position of concerned mediator to that of avowed British ally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful settlement . Haig 's plan would have produced a cease-fire between the two sides by noon E.D.T. on Friday . But the effort failed , and at week 's end the best hope for peace seemed to rest with the United Nations and a vague proposal sponsored by its Secretary-General , Javier Prez de Cullar . Both Britain and Argentina maintained that they were pursuing the peace plan " urgently and constructively , " but the language was contradicted by the mood : pessimism . <P> Despite the losses they had sustained , both countries and their leaders seemed as grimly committed as ever to their antagonistic objectives : Britain 's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , to making some 10,000 Argentine troops leave the Falklands ; Argentine President Leopoldo Fortunate Galtieri , to winning acknowledgment of his country 's sovereignty over the islands , which Argentines call the Malvinas ( after the 18th century colonists who settled there from the French village of St. Malo ) . The British task was by far the harder one , yet Foreign Secretary Francis Pym sounded as firm as ever when he declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentines ' unlawful occupation . Our resolve remains undiminished . " <P> To emphasize that point , Britain late last week declared that any Argentine ship or aircraft found more than twelve miles from Argentina 's mainland would be considered hostile and dealt with " accordingly . " Buenos Aires ' Ambassador to the U.N . Eduardo Roca immediately denounced the move as " illegal . " There was speculation that the 66-ship British armada , its deadliest elements standing at battle stations off the Falklands , might send troops ashore early this week . Weighing against that possibility was the fact that much of the equipment necessary for the invasion of the islands was aboard ships sailing from Ascension Island , 3,800 miles away , and was not expected to arrive until midweek or so . Britain , meanwhile , continued to requisition vessels of its commercial fleet , including the 67,500-ton Queen Elizabeth 2 , the world 's second largest passenger liner ( after the 70,202-ton Norway ) , to ferry additional troops and supplies to the Falklands region ( see box ) .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
