The most fightin ' words in Arizona are any kind of threat to the state 's crucial water supply . So verbal revolvers were drawn and brandished all over the state when word came last week of President Carter 's elimination of 19 water development projects from the fiscal 1978 budget . What bothered Arizonans most was that the biggest of these canceled undertakings was the $1.6 billion Central Arizona Project , which was scheduled to bring water from the Colorado River to the parched southern portion of the state by 1985 . " Without CAP , " said Wes Steiner , executive director of the state 's water commission , " all agricultural production in Arizona would have to stop . " Warned a pecan and cotton grower , Keith Walden : " Tucson will be covered up with sand and become a ghost town within a hundred years . " Said Jack Francis Jr. , co-owner of the state 's biggest cotton-gin firm : " The news was like having your dad die when you 're 17 . You just are n't ready for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutback seemed like a death sentence-and it could not have come at a worse time . Because of the drought , Gila Valley farmers-who would have benefited from CAP-are receiving only 10% to 20% of their usual water supply , and have had to reduce production drastically . The long-range outlook is even more alarming to officials . Ground water , which furnishes 40% of the state 's needs , is being pumped out at a rate five times faster than it is being restored . <P> Without more " liquid gold , " Arizonans fear that they will not be able to sustain either their $1.2 billion-a-year agricultural output or their fast-growing population . In the past five years , the number of state residents has risen by almost half a million , to 2,270,000-the biggest percentage increase in the nation . This year alone , the population could jump another 5% as more and more Easterners settle in the state-fleeing the harshest winter they have ever known for the bounteous life of the Sunbelt . <P> Adding to Arizonans ' ire is the fact that CAP is 30% funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , river crossings and tunnels have been built ; a $900,000 intake dike and a thermal-fired generating plant have also been erected . If work is stopped , 650 engineers and construction workers will be laid off . " That 's a damn poor way to create jobs , " complained Democratic Congressman Morris Udall , who was on somewhat shaky ground in making the statement ; he had not had CAP in mind when he signed a letter with more than 70 other Congressmen earlier this month urging savings in unnecessary public works projects .
