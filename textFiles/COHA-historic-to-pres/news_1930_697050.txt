Corporation Counsel Hilly of New York City , leading the attack against the rate claims of the New York Telephone Company at the renewal of hearings today before the Public Service Commission , protested the inclusion in the company 's rate base of mot e than $60,000,000 for construction now planned or under way . Present subscribers , he contended , were being forced to pay a return on facilities that will be used only by subscribers of 1931 or 1932 . He questioned various estimated increases in expenses , including a 40 per cent increase for repairs of buildings in the face of a substantial retirement of old property and the substitution of new . Scrutiny of the company 's estimated expenses revealed that its officials have enlarged their appropriation for legal expenses by $84,000 for the coming year . Last year the legal cots amounted to $395,000 . The estimate for 1930 is $479,000 . " I do n't see why you need an additional $84,000 unless you anticipate still more trouble , " Commissioner Lunn commented . Further Litigation Indicated . The disclosure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain indication that the present hearings before the commission , which is to promulgate permanent rates at the end of the next two and a half months , are only a preliminary to further litigation . By counsel for the company the hint also was given that it had not fully decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court from the Federal district court decision of last December . In any case , there appeared to be a certainty that the company would institute an action in the State courts if the forthcoming decision of ' the Public Service Commission lowers still further the rates now in effect . Both sides also count on the possibility of a commission appeal to the Supreme Court cn the lower court 's decree . Either the commission or the company must file its appeal by March 27 . The decision of the commission will probably await the naming of a new chairman . Commissioner at Odds . Continued friction between the , . Democratic members of the commission almost tied up the hearing today and caused a five-minute recess The dispute was between Commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes effective Feb. 28 , vainly sought to pacify them . Mr. Lunn was putting a series of questions to Henry C. Carpenter , staff vice president of the telephone company , when Mr. Van Namee objected . " What 's the use of all this ? " he said . " There will be a regular time for testimony on depreciation . Why not await it ? " " You and I don 's agree , " Mr. Lunn retorted , while Mr. Prendergast sug- gested , " In the words of General Grant , ' Let us have peace . ' " " I am only seeking orderly procedure so that we can get through by May 1 and not drag this out all Summer , " Mr. Van Namee explained . " I do n't surrender my responsibility because Mr. Van Namee does n't want me to ask questions , " replied Mr. Lunn . When the chairman remonstrated that the debate did not " embellish the record , " Mr. Van Namee reiterated that he objected to having time wasted , and Mr. Lunn appealed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Carpenter said he was willing to answer questions if he could . Peace was effected by Colonel Charles G. Blakeslee , counsel to the commission , who obtained a fiveminute recess . After he had , talked to the disputing commissioners , Mr. Lunn put two more questions to the witness , uninterrupted , and then desisted from his examination . Mr. Billy 's Protest . Mr. Hilly 's protest against the inclusion of present construction costs in the current rate base was enunciated when Mr. Carpenter testified that the telephone plant and equipment were being expanded , despite his prediction that 1930 would be a poor business year . " We expected an increase of over 100,000 stations this year , " he said . " At least that was our estimate at the beginning of the year . That requires a substantial amount of new construction . We also have a large amount of construction under way , necessitating the expenditure of $60 , - 000,000 to $70,000,000 in 1930 . Obviously , that work ca n't be dropped . Berliciee , we Imp to fOrynci Increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses here are for the future but are being charged against present subscribers , " Mr. Hilly said . " Why should 1930 subscribers be charged for 1931 service ? " " Whom else would we charge ? " asked Mr. Carpenter , and Commissioner Van Namee added , " Are n't the 1930 subscribers receiving benefits on construction done In 1928 , a return on which was paid by the 1928 subscribers ? " " You are charging the public for construction which will bring you additional profits in the future , " Mr. Hilly insisted . Edward L. Blackman , counsel for the company , said Mr. Hilly 's contention was altogether idle because the courts had specifically decided that the company was entitled to a return on construction In progress . Stresses Increase for Repairs . On the score of the increase for 1930 in the estimated cost of repairs , Mr. Carpenter declared that the the company 's plant had been vastly enlarged by a net increase In. property of $140,000,000 . He also pointed out that a 40 per cent increase for repairs , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might not be the same increase for other repair Items , he indicated . Among other increased expenses for 1930 , Mr. Carpenter testified , were the additional sums of $750,000 for general office expenses and $506,000 for the Relief Department and pensions . At the beginning of the hearing Mr. Blackman announced that many of the figures which the commission had requested could not be obtained in less than five to ten months ' time at a cost of less than $500,000 . An agreement was reached to obtain revenues and expenses as isolated in New York City and to supply similar data for the rest of the State , but on a different basis from that first requested . Mr. Hilly also read a statement replying to the formal allegations of the company that the temporary del 47. tbs. counliosign- Yore confiscatory . He charged that the company had sought to " intimidate " the commission in its protest . " The City of New York , " he said , " desires to go on record in denying that the New York Telephone Company has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary the commission has been unduly liberal in permitting the company to charge 80 per cent of the increase in rates that it sought to impose upon the City of New York as one of the , if not the , largest of the subscribers . " The record made in this proceeding indicates the commission and its witness , Hinman , resolved all doubts in favor of the company . " The hearing will be resumed here Tuesday . Knight to Give Date of Report . Senator Knight , chairman of the special legislative committee on revision of the Public Service Commission law , said yesterday that the date for final submission of the committee 's report would probably be made known next week . At that time it will also be announced , Senator Knight indicated , whether or not the committee will carry out its tentative plan to submit its findings to a public hearing before presenting them to the Legislature . Although the report will not deal specifically with the pending telephone rate case , it was indicated that some of its findings would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected that the report will deal extensively with the problem of establishing a uniform system of fixing rate bases and valuations of public utility properties . Another phase of the report will be its recommendations on the limitation of Federal court jurisdiction .
