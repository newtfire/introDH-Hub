During recent years Spain has sent the U. S. many an expert musician . ' Cellist Pablo Casals and Soprano Lucrezia Bori led the procession . They were followed by Conductor Enrique Fernandez Arbos , guest of the St. Louis Symphony , Guitarist Andrs Segovia , and Dancer Argentina who makes music with her heels and castanets . This year has added two more names , the Aguilar Lutanists ( TIME , Dec. 2 ) and Jos Iturbi , famed throughout Europe and South America as Spain 's greatest pianist . <P> Jos Iturbi was born in Valencia 34 years ago . In his early ' teens he won honors at the Valencia and Paris Conservatories but today he says that he has learned most by listening . At 24 , while playing in a Zurich caf , he was asked to go to the Geneva Conservatory as head of the piano faculty , a post once held by the great Franz Liszt . He accepted , stayed in Geneva for four years , then embarked on a concert career with immediate success . <P> Two months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wept . He went to a hotel chosen for him by his manager , rang for tea but , knowing no English , failed to make the waiter understand . He shrugged his shoulders , sat down at the piano , played Tea for Two , got what he wanted . His first Manhattan night was spent in a Harlem cabaret listening to brazen jazz which he adores , his second at a musicomedy . Then he started on a tour , played first with the Philadelphia Orchestra , went into Canada , then through the Middle West . <P> Conductor Willem Mengelberg of the New York Philharmonic welcomed Iturbi on his return to Manhattan . He gave him a birthday party , had a many-layered cake fashioned to represent a skyscraper . Iturbi , hugely pleased , cut it with a swoop while Pianist Ernest Schelling looked on with greedy eye . Iturbi sneaked his portion away , took it back to his hotel and sent it , adorned with two candles , to his twelve-year-old daughter in Paris . Soon afterward he appeared as Philharmonic Soloist under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week he gave a Manhattan recital solo . <P> Mozart 's A Major Sonata , Schumann 's Arabesque , Brahms ' Variations on a theme by Paganini , smaller quantities of Chopin , Debussy , Albeniz-such was the varied course which Iturbi chose to run . Because he had played Mozart with the Philharmonic , his audience was not surprised to hear him endow the Sonata with a cool , fresh beauty seldom equalled . The Brahms technical difficulties were topped at a speed which was never bewildering . Debussy , despite its mistiness , had structure , clarity . <P> When Iturbi finished his program no one left Carnegie Hall . Many rushed forward to watch his square fingers more closely , called for encore after encore . He will play once more in Manhattan , then go westward again . Now that he is a success there will accompany him the kind of press stories the public most eagerly devours . Many will be interested to know now that he likes apples , oysters , caviar , expensive cigars ; that he plays good tennis , boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lon Chaney , Pianists Wanda Landowska and George Gershwin ; that O'Rossen of Paris makes his clothes , Chanel his perfume ; that he is inevitably late save for engagements of one sort . When he is scheduled to appear in concert he is always meticulously prompt for he feels it a grave responsibility to be Jos Iturbi , Spain 's greatest pianist .
