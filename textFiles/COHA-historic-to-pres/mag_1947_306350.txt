The Woman on the Beach ( RKO Radio ) is sullen-faced Joan Bennett , one of Hollywood 's most efficient players of loose women , in an unusual and artful thriller . Along the sand comes a Coast Guardsman ( Robert Ryan ) , still shaky enough from an experience with a torpedo to be excused some of his sins in this film . His sins are extensive and , for a movie hero , pretty human . He is engaged to a nice girl ( Nan Leslie ) , but when she proves too nice and cautious to marry him in haste , he takes up with Joan , begins making love to her in a sinister-looking seaside wreck . He also meets Joan 's peculiar husband ( Charles Bickford ) . <P> Husband Bickford , who looks rather like a Beethoven left out in the rain , was once a great painter , but has gone blind . He is unpleasantly eager to make friends with the man who is carrying on with his wife , though he coldly hints his awareness of what 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the painter is holding Joan trapped in a sadistic relationship , 2 ) that Joan is no lady in distress but a bone-bred tramp , 3 ) that the pair of them are exploiting him for ugly , mysterious reasons of their own . <P> He also comes to doubt that the artist is really blind . His effort to find out , in a walk along the lip of a cliff , is a hair-raising piece of melodrama . Quieter , but no less exciting , are the nasty undertows of purely psychological uneasiness , as the members of this perverse triangle take each other 's measure . <P> The skilled principal players interestingly suggest real people ; notably good is Robert Ryan as a competent but unsophisticated man who gets involved with very bad companions . With an urgent score by Hanns Eisler , Director Jean Renoir has concocted a climax in which two men quarrel at the top of their lungs against the deafening sound of squally water and orchestral fortissimo . To balance such experiments , which smack of artiness , Renoir has thrown in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . Best of all , he has eloquently suited the pale visual tone of the film to the pale air , sea and sand of the locale and to the story 's mood of blindness , ambiquity and cryptic strain . <P> The Brasher Doubloon ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a rare coin that has been stolen from a dreary Pasadena mansion . Raymond Chandler 's famed private detective Philip Marlowe , this time played by George Montgomery , * is hired to recover it . In no time at all , the simple-looking case has branched out like a cuttlefish . The bulldoggish old dowager ( Florence Bates ) who hired Marlowe unaccountably fires him . He stays on for the sake of her frightened secretary ( Nancy Guild ) , who ca n't bear to be touched by a man but wants to get over her peculiarity . The detective also tangles with a gang of gamblers , a blackmailer , three corpses , the Los Angeles police force , and the old bulldog 's unpleasant son ( Conrad Janis ) . In the long run , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and takes an affectional full nelson on the young woman himself .
