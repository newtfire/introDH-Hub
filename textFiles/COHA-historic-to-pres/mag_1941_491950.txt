// 0 N A WARM spring day in 1881 , Samuel H. Jones , of Philadelphia , with no intention of becoming a Founding Father , tossed a bait into the sea off the east coast of Florida . Mr. Jones ' tackle was , in all probability , the sort then used for fishing in the surf . However , the tradition of Philadelphia  --  or of the name Jones , if one remembers John Paul and Bobby  --  was running strong . Mr. Jones felt a terrible strike and the battle of a halfcentury-plus was on . In the end , Mr. Jones brought to gaff a **25;1824;TOOLONG tarpon . It was the first game fish of more than one hundred pounds to be caught on rod and reel in American water . On the thirtieth of April , in this year . a large and exuberant crowd of anglers will overflow the fishdecorated salon of the Rod and Reel Club of Miami Beach to witness the giving of some seventy-five major prizes for the winter fishing tournament . The prizes , ranging all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Windsor , will be worth more than ten thousand dollars , and the winners will lead in a field of more than two hundred thousand  --  perhaps a quarter of a million  --  individual man-days of fishing . Mr. Jones ' fish is still a big fish  --  for a tarpon . But prizes will be handed out that night , without doubt , for fish that could eat the 170-pounder in two or three bites . Nobody knows all about the people who go fishing in America . Each year , they take out between ten and twelve million licenses . And , since no licenses are required for salt-water fishing or for many sorts of fresh-water fishing , it is logically assumed that some twenty-odd millions of our fellow citizens wet a line somewhere , sometime , in every twelve months . That is a lot of people . It is a bigger bunch of people than the bunch that merely looks at any other sport . It is astronomically larger than the number of persons who participate in any other sport . Hunting would rim it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a vastly bigger business February 8,1941 than football or horse racing . The money spent by fishermen each year directly and indirectly on their hobby would buy the stadia and the tracks and still leave a tidy sum . It has been carefully estimated at more than a billion dollars ! That may be difficult to believe , but when it is reckoned in terms of the number of people involved  --  in terms of tackle , boats , guides , railroad and plane fare , camps , houses , hotels , food , clothing , gasoline , and so on  --  its sense becomes clear . It is thought that something like two hundred million dollars per annum are left in the State of Florida each year by men and women who go there primarily to fish . By comparison , Florida 's citrusfruit industry and its cattle-ranching become unimpressive businesses . America 's Biggest Sports Event rTHUS it is not merely safe , but obvious , to say that fishing is our national sport . Not baseball . Fishing . And in the calendar of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint is the Metropolitan Miami Winter Fishing Tournament . Far more people compete in it than in any other sports event . More money is spent upon it . More varieties of competition are engaged in . But the prizes , relatively , are not great , and the attention given the tournament by the so-called sports world is comparatively trivial . A winning homer in a baseball game may be good for front-page banners in every city in the land ; a record marlin may not even get an inch on an inside page in a big-city daily . The reason for that becomes plain in Miami , which calls itself , justly , the " fishing capital of the world . " For many decades , people have come to Miami by thousands to fish . In a publicity-crazed city the daily procession of charter boats toward the Gulf Stream and the deployed fishermen along the banks and bridges have been regarded with a fair amount of tolerance . True , myriads have complained that the boats kept the bridges up and the roadside anglers hooked passing automobiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was giddily gaga  --  and the rest of the country with it ? about the races and the night clubs , bathing beauties and aquatic shows , jai alai and fashion parades , Lemon Queens and Orange Bowls . Angling was regarded as a quaint activity  --  picturesque and unimportant . When Mr. Erl Roman , local fishing columnist and piscatorial authority , suggested to the city fathers that a fishing tournament would he a social and sporting asset to the community , he was met by scornful laughter . But because Mr. Roman knew that various minor commercial schemes , such as the drainage of the Everglades and the netting of fish for fertilizer , were hurting his favorite pastime , he kept on talking about a tournament . He realized that a tournament would attract attention , and that Florida fishing was sick from a lack of state and municipal care . Together with other enthusiasts , he kept harping on the subject , and he used the best possible bait for Miami officials : publicity . Publicity is to Miami what a favorable balance is to a banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks ' tourney . The number of participators was small . The publicity , however , was considerable . A few city colons heard the far-off tootle of a band wagon . They jumped  --  not on  --  but toward it . In 1937 , 53,000 rods were held over the water in hopes of a tournament prize . Last year , people made an estimated 161,000 tries . This year , the number will shoot beyond that  --  and about 40 per cent of it will be composed of the frail fair sex . The tournament now lasts for ninety-nine days ? from January twelfth to April twentieth . It is run by a nonprofit group of local businessmen and enthusiasts , Anglers , Incorporated . It maintains a paid director  --  myself  --  and a staff . Operating costs are met by Miami , Miami Beach , Dade County , Coral Gables , and by contributions from various fishing camps , an air line , and local and national businesses . It is still regarded by many members of city and town commissions as an extravagant and foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the millions who read of their feats , seldom consider that angle . Nobody was ever more surprised , for instance , than the handsome young woman who , a few seasons ago , got a heavy strike while fishing for blues or trout one evening down in the Keys and brought to gaff a tarpon exactly as heavy as herself ; it was not the fish which constituted the major element of her astonishment  --  great as that was  --  but the fact that she had made herself a national figure while she was pumping and thumbing her reel and muttering with feminine dismay at what the tarpon was doing . A few years ago , newspaper sports editors would have passed up the lady 's picture for a shot of a man hitting a tennis ball . But the importance of fishing to millions is becoming recognized  --  the pretty girl and the big fish were news . Miami 's tournaments have been a principal eye-opener . Rod-and-Reel Gamblers A FISHERMAN , however , is not concerned with getting his picture in the paper . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand until there grew to be some organization in angling . A fisherman is n't watching a game  --  he 's playing it . Any fisherman has a chance ? an outside chance  --  at a record . Even a world 's record . A woman , for example , could never hope to be the heavyweight prize-fight champion ; but a woman actually has the world 's title for blue marlin , and blue marlin are tops . Her name is Mrs. Henry Sears ; she lives in Greenwich , Connecticut ; she caught the fish off Cat Cay ; it weighed 730 pounds . Another woman , Mrs. Alice Lusk , of Miami Beach , took first place for the heaviest fishcaught so far in all the winter tournaments , by bringing in , last April , a 621-pound blue marlin . A fisherman , furthermore , looks down his nose at the individual who walks up to a pari-mutuel window and places a bill on the nose of Black Dynamite . Such a person 's gambling is picayune , in the fisherman 's eyes . He faces far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his money and time but his strength , fortitude , reputation as an angler , and even , on occasion , his life . A fisherman cocks another anoot at a hunter . In the last analysis , if a hunter merely holds a tool at the right angle and pulls a trigger at the right time , his quarry will drop dead . That demands skill  --  and skill , perhaps , under difficulties  --  but in one important sense , it 's smallssination . The man with the rod and reel knows that his quarry has a better than even chance of getting away safely , even after it has been hunted down and struck . He fights his game alive , every spool turn of the distance . And he will patrol the seas , day in and day out , fierce weather or fine , with as much hardihood and bleak determination as any hunter ever showed in the search for a four-footed target . The angler has no cheering section . No teammates spur him on . When he comes home emptyhanded , he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game for that day . But it 's virtually impossible to break his spirit ; he goes back and back and back for more , even when more is  --  nothing . The golfer has his eighteen holes and the difference between courses . The angler has the entire aquatic outdoors  --  ail the variety of scenery and climate on the globe  --  and even when his " course " freezes solid , he chops a hole in the ice . He yenta the primordial need for battle upon creatures with coldblooded remorselessness  --  natural killing machinea ? not on thinking animals , or on other men . That last , perhaps , is the subtle explanation of the fact that fishermen are regarded as genial and philosophical souls  --  a connotation obviously sought by various politicians who make a pretense of fishing because it is known to be a vote-getting activity . In Miami , however , for every personage who poses with a fish just to get the public name of being an angler , there are hundreds of celebrities who fish because they love to fish . Governors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diplomats  --  everybody . On a single day , I saw six world-famous men take off in charter boats in four separate parties . On another day , a man in faded khaki and a defeated hat stepped from a charter boat and waited his turn to weigh his fish . When he found it was eligible for the tournament , he filled out a blank and silently handed it in . Initials and an address . Nobody  --  not even his captain  --  knew that he was also a governor until they looked twice at the address : State House , Raleigh , North Carolina . Often , from the crowd that comes each night to witness the return of the boats , a cry goes up : " Why ! It 's Errol Flynn ! " or , " It 's Bing Crosby ! " Or Jack Dempsey , Benny Goodman , Ben Hecht , Ernest Hemingway , Mary Martin  --  the names do n't matter , then ; just how they were hitting . And nobody ever refused a tournament prize , or one of the honorary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story and a good one . Perhaps the fishing was slow . Perhaps nobody even caught a sailfish that day . It happens , on rare occasions . But to someone , in some boat , at some time during that day , a particular and extraordinary experience happened . They saw a finback whale and were splashed by its fluke when it sounded . They were reeling in a kingfish when a porpoise took it and ran off like a rocket , snapping the line . They gaffed a gigantic ocean sunfish . They saw a sailfish on the surface that was trying to swallow a rabbit fish ? and could n't  --  because the living meal had blown itself up too big . A hooked marlin rammed the stern of the boat , broke off the line , and got away . They were fighting a grouper and " something " bit it off behind the head ? which head alone weighed thirtyseven pounds . They harpooned a loggerhead turtle . They almost ran into a waterspout . They hooked a fish that was swallowed by another which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nest of fish-within-fishes . They sighted , hooked , fought and boated a new-record barracuda , tarpon , bonito , dolphin , and here , by golly , it is ! Six Hundred Varieties There are twenty-eight kinds of game fish eligible in the Miami Tournament : African pompano , albacore , Allison 's tuna , amber jack , barracuda , black bass ( the only strictly freshwater candidate ) , bluefish , bonefish , bonito , channel bass , chiro , cobia , dolphin , grouper , jack , kingfish , mackerel , muko , blue marlin , white marlin , permit , pompano , sailfish , snapper , Snook , tarpon , trout and wahoo . That list includes , however , many subordinate members of several tribes of fishes . There are a dozen various groupers , numerous jacks , two bonitos , several mackerel , and a host of snappers , each family so nearly kin as to be conveniently classifiable in a lump . There ie even some argument about the possibility of there being more than one species of sailfish . However , Miami can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some six hundred different fish which can be taken on a rod and reel , and only the major branches of the toughest families are classed as " game . " That , of course , is the reason for the attention given Miami by the millions of fishing enthusiasts . Six hundred kinds of fish is the largest number by far which any spot on the continent can boast . And perhaps the gentlemen in the local chambers of commerce are inclined to disregard the importance of fishing to Miami because they had nothing whatever to do with the presence of those fish . They can take flamboyant credit for the sky line , the stadium , the beauty pageants , and even the flowers that bloom on the landscaped canals , but the Gulf Stream and its adjacent warm waters are a present from Nature for which no booster can take an ounce of glory . A Five-and-Ten Pastime In any case , the attitude does not dampen the near-fanaticism of the tournament competitors . And , to compete , you can be anybody with any purse . Prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shore a block from their homes and fished with fiveand-ten-cent-store tackle . The big marlin do n't shoulder in to land and grab a shrimp bait . To get them does cost money . But , of the twenty-eight classes of eligible fish , seventeen have been taken from rowboats , from piers , and also from the bank . All seventeen species  --  and possibly one or two others  --  caught from spots that coat absolutely nothing ! As director of the tournament I am , of course , on call to settle disputes , weigh an occasional fish , and investigate various claims . That aspect of my job makes very plain the abundance and availability of game fish in South Florida waters . More than once , I 've had my phone ring and an excited kid half shout , " Mr. Aitken ! This is Jimmy ! I 've just caught the biggest bonefish I ever saw in my life ! I 'm down south of the river , on the bank , where that dead-end street is ! Can you come ? " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which come the reports from charter boatmen of what is happening out in the Gulf Stream . Or I break off writing the afternoon 's radio broadcast on up-to-the-minute fishing data . I hop in my car . Jimmy is eleven , freckled , and , right now , wildeyed . Sometimes it is n't a very big bonefish . In one case , an ecstatic Jimmy called , and it was a big bonefish . It won Jimmy a prize that year . And it might he any of the sixteen other breeds that feed in near shore . I 've had another sort of call several times . A voice , perhaps with a British accent : " Mr. Aitken ? This is Williams , the Hart butler , on Sunset Island , in the Beach . Mr. Hart took his plugcasting rod out on his front lawn this morning and made a few casts from the sea wall . He 's caught what one fancies is a rather large jack and he 'd like your opinion . If it is n't incon-venient " Y , Again I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired merchant from the Middle West , doing something in the nature of a war dance on the grass between the hibiscus hedge and his wife 's rose garden . It is a big jack , all right . It stays " on the board " for several weeks until a lady fishing in the Keys catches a bigger one and pushes it into second place . Salt-water fishing is n't necessarily expensive at all . But , if you are determined to defeat any of the monsters which live in and on the edge of the Gulf Stream , the picture will change . The marlin , the sailfish , the tunas , the makos , and many others , demand a boat sturdy enough to go into the open sea . They demand expert guiding , unless you have learned the art yourself from the guides . They require help for the boating . In the Miami area there are about two hundred first-class charter boats . A maximum of four people can fish from one boat with comfort . The price is from twenty-five to thirty-five dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That includes everything except lunch ; the customer is expected to supply a meal for the captain and the mate as well as for his own party . If four persons split the costs , it means that a full day  --  sunup to sundown ? may be had in the Gulf Stream , on the finest sports cruiser , with the services of the most skillful men in the business , for a maximum of ten dollars per man . You need have no fear of being a novice , of never having fished even in fresh water , or of getting seasick . Every man on every boat has " fished " thousands of persons like yourself . He will show you the ropes , tell you what to do when you hang a fish , and , if you 're sick , take you inside the Bay where you can try your luck on myriad species in gluescalm water . The Tough-Luck Trophy Crunch and Des , the two fishing guides in Philip Wylie 's deep-sea yarns , are typical of the boatmen you may expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tournament , has done a dependable job in describing the thrills , anxieties , fun and the lore of fishing in Florida , the Bahamas , California , Jersey and elsewhere . He has been a salt-water angler for eleven years . He 's won two citations and one prize in the tournaments . He 's taken blue marlin , white marlin , giant tuna , and a great many others . He has his heart set on a broadhill  --  and that 's a goal , for a fact ! In almost fifty years of fishing , I 've never caught one . I 've hooked and fought fourteen , but I 've never brought one back in the boat . Phil has n't hooked any -- yet . No broadbill has ever been entered in the Miami tournament , though several have been caught between the winter and summer events . Phil fancies himself as a hard-luck fisherman ? though his record belies it  --  to such an extent that , for this year 's tourney , he is offering a special cup , called the Tough-Luck Trophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic fumble made during the contest . The cup bears Phil 's name as donor and the motto : " You and me , both ! " There ought to he plenty of competition for it because the mathematical possibilities of failure in fishing are infinite . Phil 's stories are regarded by the majority of South Florida 's citizens as a superb advertisement , which , of course , they are . However , their author is resentful of the attitude . " If these fish were in Greenland , " he says , " I 'd write about Greenland , and the Danes , who own it , would get the publicity ! A lot of men who regard me as a sort of inspired Florida press agent would nevertheless unthinkingly destroy every fish in the Bay , if their destruction were incidental to a financial profit . Look at the way they 've ruined lakes , rivers and canals to reclaim peat land that caught fire and burned up as soon as it was dry ! " Phil is an experimental fisherman . Right now , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be some new Crunch yarns about that soon . And Phil , I am sure , would he the first to admit that the fictional cruises of the Poseidon are n't necessarily illustrative of what will happen to one party , on one boat , in any given day . They 're all possible yarns  --  something like every one has actually happened ? and Phil says there are countless real adventures he ca n't write as fiction because they 're too incredible . But , as he puts it , he writes of Crunch and Des as if one of the best stories told in the fishing fleet for any given week took place aboard the Poseidon each time she slipped her moorings and put out to sea . There are plenty of headaches in the tournament  --  for anglers and for the people who run it . There was , for example , the man who caught a round pompano that might have been a record . But he did n't know it was a candidate for that distinction . He just ate it . Phil Wylie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camp in the Keys . He wanted it weighed and measured officially , and he wanted it mounted . He hung it on a fish rack pending the departure of the morning bus for Miami . Somebody stole it . All he had was a photograph that did n't show the whole fish . There was the young woman , last year , who caught a big ladyfish . She knew it was big , and she knew approximately how big ? later ? because it just did n't quite fit flat in her fish box , which proved to he thirty-seven inches long . When she put in at a dock she asked if ladyfish were eligible in the tournament . The dockmaster consulted the rules and said no . So the girl rowed out and hurled the dead beauty overboard . Ladyfish were eligible , all right , but we had unfortunately listed them under their other name : Chiro . The girl 's fish would have established a new record . This year both names are on the list . Sometimes that cloud has a silver lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the distinction requires knowledge . The easiest method to make it is to spread out the dorsal fin ? marlin dorsals are retractable into deep slots , as are the huge dorsals of sailfish . If the forward peak of the dorsal is rounded , it 's a white ; if the peak is a sharp point that drops away in a concave curve , its a blue . There may bees eept ional freaks ? the sea is fecund of freakishness -- but I 've never seen any . One day during the tournament a captain called me on the radio phone to say he 'd just boated a nice blue . Not big enough , he said , to take a first or second place in the tournament , but a good fish , nevertheless . Maybe a hundred and fifty pounds . By mere chance , I happened to he at the dock when they brought in that fish , and , from some inexplicable whim , I examined it , pulling out the dorsal fin . It was n't blue marlin at all , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ? and , as such , it was not only eligible but it took first prize . That captain had fished out of Miami for years , but this particular white marlin was so big he simply assumed , automatically , that it was n't a white at all . Nobody was more astonished than he --  nobody more pleased than his customer . People cheat ? or try to ? of course . The rules of the tournament are extremely simple . Fundamentally , they are : ( 1 ) The angler must set the hook and bring the fish to gaff or net , unaided . ( 2 ) A fish is disqualified if if has been shot , harpooned , taken on a hand line  --  i. e. , without the use of a rod and reel  --  mutilated by the attack of another fish , injured otherwise , or caught on a rod that was broken during the battle . ( 3 ) The fish must be weighed at an official station and an entry blank properly filled out for it . ( Continued from Page 62 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch . One , for example , weighed in a common shark , disposed of the carcass , and said he had caught a mako . On examination by a judge , he proved unable even to describe a mako , which is different in color , shape , teeth and eyes , from all other sharks . I 've never seen tried the old gag of stuffing lead sinkers in a fish 's throat , but I once found a man who attempted to increase the weight of his catch by pushing into its maw another , smaller fish . Now , anything a fish has eaten naturally is reckoned in its weight . But this man , unfortunately for him , had force-fed his quarry a fish that simply did not live in the same waters . And the tail stuck out ! An embarrassing error which produced a red-faced confession . And , two or three times , a man who laid claim to a big fish was seen during the fight to change places with somebody else in order to rest . The witness of that heresy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipper idly peering through binoculars  --  reported the fact to me and the fish was not entered . It can be seen that cheating of any kind may result in humiliation . It should he repeated , however , that the fishing fraternity  --  and sorority  --  is probably the most dutifully honest hunch of people in the world . Imitations of the Miami tournaments ? there is one in the winter and one in the summer ? have sprung up all Two months later , with high hopes , the Varians opened their invention factory in the sleepy microscopic village of Halcyon . They settled on Halcyon because it was their old home town , and they figured Sigurd 's four thousand dollars would last longer there than anywhere else . Russell was the idea man . Sig , who could make anything with his hands , was the mechanic . Their first discovery was that , though they worked hard , they were getting nowhere fast . " We 've got to have a physics lab , " said Russell . " We need a precision machine shop just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go up to Stanford and see if we can make arrangements to use the university 's , " suggested Russell . With their belongings , and Sig 's family , the Varians headed for Palo Alto . When they laid their idea before Dr. David L. Webster , head of the Stanford physics department , he said : " We can stretch a point and make you research associates without pay ; that will give you the use of the laboratory and the shop . We can furnish you with materials . But we have n't any money . " Sigurd Varian found a tiny cottage across the creek from the campus . Russ located a cheap room in Mayfield . The pair came to work early , quit late at night , working against time and Sig 's slim bank account . Big Bill Hansen joined them before and after classes . Likewise , Doctor Webster , with his flair for higher-mathematic computations , took a lot of the guesswork out of electronics . Sig sat around drumming with his fingers , restless and impatient , rearing to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate Russ was forever citing some advice about inventing that his father picked up from Uncle John Osborne . " There are only two ways to invent , " quoth Uncle John . " One is to over the country . Miami has gladly SuPplied full particulars to any community desirous of inaugurating such an event . Inquiries come from as far away as Australia , where the fishing is fine and a good catch gets a threecolumn picture on the front pages with a banner headline . The press and radio in Miami have learned , year by year , that angling is Florida 's biggest sport and they have given it increasing attention . Men have come all the way from England to compete in our tournament . Some of those men , now , to my knowledge , are out on their fishing cruisers sweeping mines from the Channel . Others  --  several of them  --  commuted in sports fishermen for ten days between Ramsgate and Dunkirk . This year , on the twelfth of January , the glamorously decorated fishing fleet paraded along the Causeway and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as always , a special prize for the first eligible fish brought to a weighing station on that starting day . Perhaps some millionaire , with a cruiser that cost forty thousand dollars , hung a sailfish the minute he dropped a bait overboard and raced back to collect that prize . Perhaps , as in 1940 , that prize was taken by a young man in a rowboat with an outboard motor , who started to fish when the gun was fired and actually cut through the marine flotilla to win before the more ostentatious anglers had wet a single line ! make a model of every idea you have and try it . That 's the slow way . The other is to discard all your ideas on paper but the last one . That 's the fast way . " While Sigurd fretted , Russell Varian washed out twenty-six different ideas for landing beams that looked rosy when they started . He washed them out on paper with the help of Professor Hansen and Doctor Webster . As fast as the group doused cold water on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . There was one tremendous drawback to using Bill Hansen 's copper apple . The stream of electrons it built up into such terrific voltages was direct current . For their beam , the inventors needed oscillating energy . They could think of no mechanism fast enough to break up energy traveling at such terrific speed , 25,000 miles per second . It looked as though they were stumped . Then , as Russ Varian sat at his desk late one night , his twenty-seventh idea began to take shape . " It was a kind of fancy idea , and I was skeptical at first because all ideas have bugs , " recalls Russ . " Still , it looked like a darn good lead . So I told Sig and Bill the next morning and they thought it might work . It sounded better yet when we outlined it to Doctor Webster .
