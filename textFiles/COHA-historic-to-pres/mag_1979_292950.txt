Minor differences keep delaying a U.S.-Soviet arms pact <P> It is one of the longest countdowns in diplomatic memory-and one of the most frustrating . For months the end of the U.S.-Soviet arms talks has seemed so imminent that officials and reporters have mounted a kind of SALT vigil . But a settlement keeps turning out to be just beyond reach . No sooner have negotiators resolved what earlier had been described as the last few issues than new points of dispute pop up . <P> Last week was typical . As it began , there were encouraging signs that the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. might approve a SALT II draft treaty within a few days . The White House had scheduled a background briefing for the press , and it was known that Jimmy Carter was planning to make SALT the centerpiece of his speech at the American Newspaper Publishers Association conference in Manhattan . There was even some speculation that he would use this forum to announce the conclusion of the talks . <P> The Cabinet-level Special Coordination Committee , which sets tactics for the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions for what might have turned out to be his final SALT II bargaining round with Soviet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin . But after conferring Wednesday , bringing to eight their meetings in April alone , the two senior diplomats were still unable to tie up the treaty 's ever unraveling ends . As usual , each of last week 's negotiating sessions yielded some progress , but not enough . <P> What stymied the talks this time were again relatively minor issues . Both sides , for example , had previously agreed that the number of MlRVs ( multiple warheads ) on each type of intercontinental ballistic missile would be frozen at the quantity already tested . That meant a maximum of ten for the Soviet monster SS-18 . But last December the U.S. detected the Soviets testing an SS-18 in a way that suggested that the missile might soon have the capacity to carry twelve warheads . Since the MIRV freeze is an important selling point in the upcoming battle for SALT II ratification , the Carter Administration wants specific language banning any Soviet test that could allow more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , the Soviets brought up an old complaint about America 's ICBMs . Under SALT II , each side will be allowed a maximum of 820 land-based , MiRVed rockets , and the two countries must agree in advance which are to be counted as MIRVs . From time to time the Soviets have hinted darkly that they were having difficulty distinguishing the 450 U.S. single-warhead Minuteman IIs from the 550 MiRVed Minuteman IIIs . For months they were silent on the issue , but they recently brought it up again , probably for bargaining leverage on other issues . What especially irritated the U.S. negotiators was that Moscow had previously implied that it had adequate means of determining the difference between the silos containing Minuteman IIs and Minuteman IIIs.
