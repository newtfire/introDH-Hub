Let it be said at once that Mr. EDwant . Box 's prize for a peace plan has ceased to be open to ridicule . Any man from now on who seeks merely to make fun of it will make himself ridiculous . A scheme which has gained weight and dignity by , the names and counsel of ELIHU ROOT , JOHN W. DAM , Judge LEARNED HAND , General MAcmoRn , Governor MILLER , Colonel HOUSE and honorable women not a few is no longer fair game for flippant humorists . Whatever else may be said of the Bok prize and its award , announced today , no one can deny that it has already been of great use in freshening discussion of an ' old subject . Merely as a device to stir and inform public opinion . In a country ruled by public opinion , the whole affair is already an achieved and creditable success . Turning to the winning plan itself , It is not in such form as to be laid before the Senate for approval . It ? consists of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public can vote on it as it stands , but it would have to be thrown into some other form before it could be laid before the Senate for formal action . It is true that its first recommendation , that the United States at once join the Permanent Court of International Justice , is embodied in a bill upon which the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate is still sitting heavily . That might be reported out and voted upon . But the other propos-qls of the winning plan would require to be recast in the form of a resolution , or to be tied up with a reconsideration by the Senate of the Covenant of the League of Nations . Either seems most unlikely at present . so that we must fall back on the idea that the plan will have its greatest immediate value in summoning a large and intelligent expression of sentiment , either for or against , through the balloting of interested citizens . Perhaps the best part of the winning plan is what may be . called its preamble . This consists of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as concerns international courts and co-operation with other nations , and also of the actual operation of the League of Nations since it came into being . This latter survey shows how most of the scruples and fears with which the League of Nations was regarded by some Americans have been dissipated or disproved by the way in which the League has interpreted its authority and directed its activities . The difficulties of walking have been solved by walking . Nowhere in the course followed by the League has there been any appearance of the dreaded superState . There has been no reliance upon military force . No nation has been called upon to do anything of which its constituted authorities did not approve . Moreover , in its own version of the scope of the famous article X. and in its amended form or quiet ignoring of Article XVI . the League has made it plain that it can not and does not desire to resort to any kind of compulsion which all the nations can not freely engage to apply in the name of peace which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of public opinion . " Consistent friends of the League of Nations must get a certain humorous satisfaction out of the discovery that all the inquiry and study and comparison of views brought about by the Bok prize simply lead us back to where we stood before . We must enter the International Court . If we can not just yet join the League of Nations , we must co-operate with it more fully and heartily than we have - yet done , and recognize the fact that no other association of nations or scheme of international co-operation lass the slightest chance of displacing , it The winning plan ** urges our joining the League With certain% reservations . It so suggests - that the United States insist upon a re-e vision of the Covenant . This is both . unwise and needless , as the very re- , view coming-first in the winning plait shows that America can get what she wants by interpretation of the articles in question , or by formal - reservations , without any radical amendments . It would be at thug late day imprudent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any considerable extent , the-Covenant of the League . All that is necessary is to let it stand as it is and to work together with the component members , assured that every national right we have will be fully protected . The substance of the winning plan is accurately represented in the condensed statement printed along with the ballot . If no one cares to read I more than that , he will have enough before him to vote upon understandingly . It is hard to believe that many could cast a ballot against the sub- I stance of the plan . Its general principles are such as to command almost I universal assent . If a timid or prejudiced person objects to approving these principles , because that might imply approval of the League of ** he ought to see that this is no good reason for not voting at all , and also that he should take a second look at the League of Nations , sous to find out if its fundamental aims are not those in which he has always believed .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
