Least Wanted FBI director J. Edgar Hoover has announced that he took a physical in August and " I was in better shape than I was in 1938 . " That 's Hoover himself speaking and , as he has repeatedly assured us during his 46 years as head of the agency , " The FBI never makes recommendations or draws conclusions . We are a fact-finding agency . " Draw your own conclusion : 76 next January , Hoover on the basis of his own fact-finding is good for another 32 or more years in charge of this nation 's pursuit of the Ungodly . Who they are , Hoover decides . Formerly , the most wanted people were Communists . As former Attorney General Ramsey Clark says in his book , Crime in America , published last week , the FBI under Hoover " was still making pursuit of the Communist Party its claim to fame long after there was any risk to national security from that source . " But Hoover is a man who believes in keeping pace with . . . well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of young radicals : no fewer than nine on his list of the 16 most wanted criminals are n't criminals in the conventional sense at all , they 're political ideologues ( three of the nine are women ) . Hoover says he believes these young people are more dangerous than the old-style Dillingers because they 're " less experienced " and so apt to blow the head off any person , cop or FBI agent who gets in their way . Skeptics who include other law enforcers have had the nerve to contradict Hoover on the point , and to suggest that the crimes record division of the FBI is also its public relations operation . We seem to recall that whereas the radical Angela Davis went along quietly when she was picked up in New York City , the late John Dillinger wasted not a second in attempting to shoot his way out of an FBI ambush . Seven people on the current FBI list of most wanted are tough criminals with long records , but the nine youthful politicals , wanted for alleged bombings , conspiracy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal attention of the FBI chief , who spends a goodly portion of his time directing the public eye to campus disrupters and the like . " Thai 's what knocks ' em dead out in Dubuque , " one big-city police official explained to The Wall Street Journal . Who really cares all that much that professional criminals with several notches on their guns and axes are at large ? Were n't they always ? The new danger is these kids with shoulder-length hair 6 and far-out notions and ( maybe ) home-made bombs . And , of course , black militants . Burke Marshall , who was Attorney General Ken-nedy 's civil rights assistant , has been quoted as saying that the FBI and Hoover " deliberately set out to get Martin Luther King , Jr . " Hoover has never denied that the FBI tapped the late Dr. King 's phone , but said it did so reluctantly , under orders from Kennedy . The truth seems to be that Hoover kept pressing Kennedy and his successors , including Clark ( the worst Attorney General in 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until two days before the civil rights leader was murdered . Clark calls electronic surveillance " a petty game , far from the arena of criminal activity , and wasting valuable time . " He charges that in the organized crime area , from at least the late 195os until July 1965 ( when President Johnson prohibited , by executive order , all wire-tapping without the specific approval of the Attorney General ) " hundreds of man-years of agent time were wasted . " The tapping secured no convictions . There is strong reason , moreover , to believe that Hoover bugged as well as tapped King . The information obtained was used to suggest that King was guilty , as a black man , of something that Hoover seemed to feel was more heinous even than disloyalty . It was spread around that King indulged himself with white women . If it 's true , as one police chief declares , that the FBI 's most-wanted criminal list " is not taken seriously by any law-enforcement people outside the Bureau , " and that the agency is little better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with it ? Last week , he supplied part of the answer by tossing a bouquet at John Mitchell : " There has never been an Attorney General for whom I 've had higher regard . " That is only part of the answer , however . Mr. Hoover has got away with it under Attorneys General for whom he had no respect at all , and who knew it . He 's box-office , that 's the answer , and he has been box-office longer than anyone else , even John Wayne . He is immovable , if not immutable , like the Washington Monument . He has been around so long that younger people sometimes confuse him with the Hoover who was President , and this Hoover sometimes seems to share that confusion . In 1953 , the FBI chief did n't hesitate to imply that former President Truman had lied about his bureau . No reprimand was forthcoming from the White House . Hoover has gone his own stern way , and no President has had the wish or guts to bring him in line or retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy invited two of his closest friends to make any recommendations they wished . Both advised : Fire Allen Dulles ( then CIA director ) and J. Edgar Hoover . The next day , Kennedy reappointed them both . It was smart politics , the pros said . The President very soon came to regret the Dulles reappointment at the time of the Bay of Pigs . The regrets were slower to arrive in the second instance ; but they came and were felt acutely by the President 's brother . When Bobby Kennedy pressed him to hire more Negro agents , Hoover taunted the Attorney General by saying that if he did n't like Hoover 's point of view or way of doing things , " why do n't you get another director ? " The FBI chief immediately reported that interchange to President Johnson , who , according to Hoover , said " Stand by your guns . " There are t8,000 FBI agents , but the FBI refuses to reveal how many of these are black . It says it is not prepared to let the American public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights never did interest Hoover . In the fifties , he thought it would be unnecessarily inflammatory if the Eisenhower Administration made lynching a federal offense . After three civil rights workers were murdered in Mississippi , in 1964 , Hoover went to Jackson and deplored " overemphasis " on civil rights . When Eugene McCarthy , during his campaign for the Presidential nomination in ' 68 , said that one of the first things he would do if elected would be to fire Mr. Hoover , it was as if the death of God had been announced . But then , sensible politicians always knew that Gene McCarthy was not a " serious " politician ; you can fight City Hall once in a while , and win , but you ca n't beat box-office . Out Gunning Just how much impact groups outside the traditional political structure have on the outcome of an election is a question that usually goes unanswered , even in post-mortems . But to Michael J. Parker , a 30-year-old criminal lawyer who played a lead role in organizing Citizens Against Tydings ( CAT ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat Senator Joe Tydings . Parker , whose ground floor office is in the slum-fringed area just down the hilt from the nation 's Captol is against gun control . He sees it as a " civil liberties issue . " ( He is a member of ACLU . ) " We decided we 'd spent enough time talking to Tydings , " he told this journal . " We made our feelings on his gun control legislation known to him many times . It gets to the point where letter writing just wo n't work . " That was the point at which Parker and Dr. Constantine P. Chaconas , a dental surgeon , established CAT , in a Route ioi motel . How big was CAT ? " Three or four hundred at the peak period , twice as many over the whole 13 months , " Parker says . They passed out 150,000 bumper stickers ( the ones that said " IF Tydings Wins , You Lose " ) , mailed out 35,000 brochures , distributed 15o,000 brochures , ran 3o full-page ads and four days of radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might have been enough to switch 15,000 votes to Tydings ' victorious Republican opponent . What draws people to something like CAT ? Parker insists that many of them were not firearms owners ! " Generally , it was a concern for the residuum of our rights . We did n't like to be legislatively declared criminals . A lot of people like to target shoot ( Parker does ) ; others are gun collectors . Some of my best liberal friends keep a gun under their pillow at night . They 're scared to death they 'll be faced by someone the next time we have a riot . " What about financing ? " Gun Week kept us alive , " according to Parker . It 's a weekly whose gun-owner subscribers responded to CAT ads with a steady flow of small bills . CAT spent an estimated $50,000 to $6o,000 , a large percentage of which came from out-of-state contributors in $1. and $s amounts . " There were only a couple of $t000 contributions , " and none , he says , from the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gun nuts " have been active . In Pennsylvania in 1968 they claimed the scalp of Democratic Sen. Joe Clark , and top people in Republican Sen. Richard Schweiker 's office would be the last to deny them credit . " That fall , all we heard at the factory gates in southwestern Pennsylvania ( steelworker country ) was guns and Wallace , " a Schweiker man says . Parker is interesting on that point . " We were in a position to move votes the Republican organization could n't . We moved a whole lot more votes in Montgomery County than the Washington Post will ever admit . " He recalls a public meeting in Rockville , Maryland that drew ao , 000 people to protest a county gun control law . Nor was it limited to white suburban areas : " Around the edges of the Baltimore ghetto you find the lower middle-class civil servants living in their own homes . There are some Negro gun clubs in Baltimore , you know . Those people are just as sensitive as white suburbanites . After all , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . " Exit Goodell The Administration 's purge of Senator Charles Goodell was more intricate than it appeared to the public . Mr. Nixon 's machine went into action against the New York senator last February ? five days after he became the first Republican senator to oppose the nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court . At that time , Bernard J. Lasker , chairman of the New York Stock Exchange , quietly confronted Goodell in his Senate office and identified himself as an emissary of Vice President Agnew . " Mr. Lasker pursued the possibility of my muting my voice , " Senator Goodell recalled later , " and adapting to the Administration politically , and conceivably getting support from the Administration . " After Goodell rejected Lasker 's overtures , the stock exchange chairman ? encouraged by Mr. Agnew ? lobbied against Goodell with New York campaign contributors , later helped raise money for Conservative party candidate James Buckley . Wall Street doors were closed to Goodell . The Administration prevented him from making the politically valuable announcements of federal grants and projects slated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His staff ran into roadblocks when they tried to deal with lower-ranking Administration officials , These were the first steps of a purge that concluded with Vice President Agnew attacking Goodell as the " Christine Jorgensen " of politics and President Nixon all but openly endorsing Buckley . The impact of the purge ? " I think the President hurt me significantly , " says Goodell , who discounts the effect of Agnew 's attacks on him . But Administration opposition was only one of several factors contributing to his defeat . " Both Dick Ottinger and I made the mistake of feeling that the other was the prime opponent . We underrated the law-and-order reaction of the voters . " Goodell was further battered by Governor Nelson Rockefeller 's failure to offer him significant campaign support and by the New York Daily News straw vote , which showed Goodell running a poor third behind Buckley and Ottinger shortly before the November 5 election . Though defeated , Goodell gets a last shot at the Nixon Administration in this rump session . While his staff crates up old files and prepares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation in five major areas , including health insurance and election reform , and to oppose Mr. Nixon 's request for an additional $zoo million For ABM . He may resign from the session a few days early and permit Buckley to take over " to give the people of New York State some seniority . " Then be will ponder how to pay his $400-thousand campaign debt . He does n't expect any help from the Republican party .
