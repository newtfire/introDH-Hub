The chains binding Granville Oliver 's wrists scraped the scarred surface of the table before him . Manacles also bound his ankles . Oliver 's shoulders and chest filled out the orange jumpsuit he had worn for half a year . His eyes , almost golden when Strange had first met him , were now the color of creamed-up coffee , dull in the artificial light of the interview room of the D.C. Jail . " Looks like you 're keeping your physical self together , " said Strange , seated on the other side of the table . " Push-ups , " said Oliver . " I try to do a few hundred every day . " " You still down in the Hole ? " " You mean Special Management . I do n't know what 's so special about it ; ai n't nothin ' but a box . They let me out of it one hour for every forty-eight . " Strange and Oliver were surrounded by Plexiglas dividers in a space partitioned by cubicles . Nearby , public defenders and CJA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute , somewhat , the various conversations , leaving a low , steady mutter in the room . A thick-necked armed guard sat watching the activity from a chair behind a window in a darkened booth . " It wo n't be long , " said Strange . " They finished with the jury selection . " " Ives told me . They finally found a dozen D.C. residents were n't opposed to the death penalty , how 'd they put it , on principle . Which means they found some white people gon na have no problem to sit up there and judge me . " " Four whites , " said Strange . " How you think they gon na find me , Strange ? Guilty ? " Strange looked down and tapped his pen on the open folder lying on the table . He did n't care to take the conversation any further in that direction . He was n't here to discuss what was or was not going to happen relative to the trial , and he was , by definition of his role as an investigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true that he had a personal connection to this case , but from the start he had been determined to treat this as just another job . " The prosecution 's going to put Phillip Wood up there first , " said Strange . " Told you when I met you the very first time he was gon na be my Judas . Phil ca n't do no more maximum time . Last time he was inside , they took away his manhood . I mean they ass-raped him good . I knew that boy would flip . " Oliver tried to smile . " Far as geography goes , though , we still close . They got him over there in the Snitch Hive , Strange . Me and Phil , we 're like neighbors . " Wood had been Granville 's top lieutenant . He had pled out in exchange for testimony against Oliver . Wood would get life , as he had admitted to being the triggerman in other murders ; death had been taken off the table . He was housed in the Correctional Treatment Facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the backyard of the D.C. Jail . " I 've been gathering background for the cross , " said Strange . " I was looking for you to lead me to one of Phillip 's old girlfriends . " " Phil knew a lot of girls . The way he used to flash ... even a bitch can get some pussy ; ai n't no trick to that . Phil used to drive this Turbo Z I had bought for him around to the high schools , ' specially over in Maryland , in PG ? Drive by with that Kenwood sound system he had in there , playin ' it loud . The girls used to run up to the car . They did n't even know who he was , and it did n't matter . It was obvious he had money , and what he did to get it . Girls just want to be up in there with the stars . It 's like that , Strange . " " I 'm looking for one girl in particular . She swore out a brutality complaint against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They do n't have to give you charges , only convictions . I found it in his jacket down at the court . This particular charge , it was no-papered . Never went to trial . " " What 's the girl 's name ? " " Devra Stokes . Should be about twenty-two by now . She worked at the Paramount Beauty Salon on Good Hope Road . " Oliver grunted . " Sounds right . Phil did like to chill in those beauty parlors . Said that 's where the girls were , so he wanted to be there , too . But I do n't know her . We went through a lot of young girls . We were kickin ' it with ' em , for the most part . But we were using them for other shit , too . " " What else would he have used a girl like Devra Stokes for ? " " Well , if she was old enough , and she did n't have no priors , we 'd take her into Maryland or Virginia to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . We paid for it , but she 'd sign the forty-four seventy-three . What they call the yellow form . " " You mean for a straw purchase . " " A straw gun , yeah . Course , not all the time . You could rent a gun or get it from people we knew to get it from in the neighborhood . It 's easy for a youngun to get a gun in the city . Easier than it is to buy a car . Shoot , you got to register a car . " Strange repeated the name : " Devra Stokes . " " Like I say , I do n't recall . But look , she was workin ' in a salon , chance is , she still doin ' the same thing , maybe somewhere else , but in the area . Those girls move around , but not too far . " " Right . " " Phil 's gon na say I killed my uncle , ai n't that right ? " " I do n't know what he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other across the desk . " You standin ' tall , big man ? " said Oliver . Oliver was questioning Strange 's loyalty . Strange answered by holding Oliver 's gaze . " I ai n't no dreamer , " said Oliver . " One way or the other , it 's over for me . The business is done . Most of the boys I came up with , they 're dead or doin ' long time . One of the young ones I brought along got his own thing now , but he 's cut things off with me . Word I get is , he still got himself lined up with Phil . Shoot , I hear they got two operations fighting over what I built as we sit here today . " " What 's your point ? " " I feel like I 'm already gone . They want to erase me , Strange . Make it so I do n't exist no more . The same way they keep poor young black boys and girls out of the public 's eyes today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid . Warehousin ' me and those like me down in the Section Eights . Now the government wants to bring me out and make an example out of me for a hot minute , then make me disappear again . And I 'm a good candidate , too , ai n't I ? A strong young nigger with an attitude . They want to strap me to that table in Indiana and give me that needle and show people , that 's what happens when you do n't stay down where we done put you . That 's what happens when you rise up . They want to do this to me bad . So bad that they 'd fuck with someone who was trying to help me to stop it , hear ? " You left out the part about all the young black men you killed or had killed , thought Strange . And the part about you poisoning your own community with drugs , and ruining the lives of all the young people you recruited and the lives of their families . But there were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange , following a personal policy , did not comment either way . " So I was just wondering , " said Oliver . " When they try to shake you down - and they will - are you gon na stand tall ? " " Do n't insult me , " said Strange . " And do n't ever let me get the idea that you 're threatening me . ' Cause I will walk . And you do not want me to do that . " Strange kept his voice even and his shoulders straight . He hoped his anger , and his fear , did not show on his face . Strange knew that even from in here , Oliver could have most anyone killed out on the street . Oliver smiled , his face turning from hard to handsome . Like many who had attained his position , he was intelligent , despite his limited education , and could be a charming young man at will . When he relaxed his features , he favored his deceased father , a man Strange had known in the 1960s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was just askin ' a question , big man . I do n't have many friends left , and I want to make sure that the ones I do have stay friends . We square , right ? " " We 're square . " " Good . But , look here , do n't come up in here empty-handed next time . I could use some smokes or somethin ' . " " You know I ca n't be bringin ' any contraband in here . They bar me from these meetings , it 's gon na be a setback for what we 're trying to accomplish . " " I hear you . How about some porno mags , though ? " " I 'll see you next time . " Strange stood . " One more thing , " said Oliver . " What is it ? " said Strange . " I was wonderin ' how Robert Gray was doin ' ? " " He 's staying with his aunt . " " She ai n't right . " " I know it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all pumped up about playing football for us this year . We 're gon na start him in the camp this summer , comin ' up . " " That 's my little man right there . You 're gon na see , that boy can jook . Check up on him , will you ? " " I get the time , I 'll go by there today . " " Thank you . " " Stay strong , Granville . " Strange signaled the fat man in the booth and walked from the room . Out in the air , on the 1900 block of D Street in Southeast , Derek Strange walked to his car . He dropped under the wheel of his work vehicle , a white-over-black ' 89 Caprice with a 350 square block under the hood , and rolled down the window . He had a while to kill before meeting Quinn back at the office , and he did n't want to face the ringing phone and the message slips spread out on his desk . He decided he would sit in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new day . Strange poured a cup of coffee from the thermos he kept in his car . Coffee was okay for times like this , but he kept water in the thermos when he was doing a surveillance , because coffee went through him too quick . He only sipped the water when he knew he 'd be in the car for a long stretch , and on those occasions he kept a cup in the car with a plastic lid on it , in which he could urinate as needed . Strange tasted the coffee . Janine had brewed it for him that morning before he left the house . The woman could cook , and she could make some coffee , too . Strange picked up the newspaper beside him on the bench , which he had snatched off the lawn outside Janine 's house earlier that morning on his way to the car . He pulled the Metro section free and scanned the front page . The Washington Post was running yet another story today in a series documenting the ongoing progress of the Granville Oliver trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the murder of his own uncle , while running the Oliver Mob , a large-scale , longtime drug business operating in the Southeast quadrant of the city . The Feds were seeking death for Oliver under the RICO act , despite the fact that the District 's residents had overwhelmingly rejected the death penalty in a local referendum . The combination of racketeering and certain violent crimes allowed the government to exercise this option . The last execution in D.C. had been carried out in 1957 . The jury selection process had taken several months , as it had been difficult to find twelve local residents unopposed to capital punishment . During this time , Oliver 's attorneys , from the firm of Ives and Colby , had employed Strange to gather evidence , data , and countertestimony for the defense . Strange skipped the article , jumping inside Metro to page 3 . His eyes went to a daily crime column unofficially known by longtime Washingtonians as " the Roundup , " or the " Violent Negro Deaths . " The first small headline read , " Teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sentences : " An 18-year-old man found with multiple gunshot wounds in Southeast Washington died early yesterday at Prince George 's County Hospital Center , police said . The unidentified man was found just after midnight in the courtyard area behind the Stoneridge apartments in the 300 block of Anacostia Road , and was pronounced dead at 1:03 a.m . " Two sentences , thought Strange . That 's all a certain kind of kid in this town 's gon na get to sum up his life . There would be more deaths , most likely retribution kills , related to this one . Later , the murder gun might turn up somewhere down the food chain . Later , the crime might get " solved , " pinned on the shooter by a snitch in a plea-out . Whatever happened , this would be the last the general public would hear about this young man , a passing mention to be filed away in a newspaper morgue , one brief paragraph without even a name attached to prove that he had existed . Another unidentified YBM , dead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell , thought Strange . The way it separates this city for real , might as well go ahead and call it a canyon . Strange dropped the newspaper back on the bench seat . He turned the key in the ignition and pushed a Spinners tape into his deck . He pulled out of his spot and drove west . Just a few sips of coffee , and already he had to pee . Anyway , he could n't sit here all day . It was time to go to work . ( Continues ... )
