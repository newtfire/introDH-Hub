ART . VL-TIIE INFLUENCE OF GREAT MEN . A Discourse delivered at the funeral of Professor Moses Stu art . By EDWARDS A. PARK . Andover , 1852 . IN the subject of this discourse we feel a deep interest . Few men have ever imbedded themselves more deeply in the affections of others , or exerted a wider influence over the educated mind of their day , than did the lamented Stuart . In his placein the appropriate sphere of his labors-he was indeed the star of America . That star has melted away into the light of heaven . The discourse above was called forth by that event . With little time for preparation , and pressed down with the common grief which his death awakened , the Professor has yet poured forth in this discourse a train of eloquent remarks , which // touches the soul of the reader , and brings him into sympathy with the subject , and with the occasion . It is indeed a noble tribute to the memory of the departed sage . The portrait is excellent-is life-like  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which the Christian scholar glorified the Master . But our object is not criticism . We have placed this discourse at the head of our article for the sake of its testimony to exalted worth , and as thus bearing upon a subject , to which we wish to call the attention of our readers , namely , Tni* INFLUENCE OF GREAT MEN . Our object is not their eulogy , but their work in its relation to the elevation of man-in its influence on the progress of truth and righteousness over the earth , and as a part of those instrumentalities , by means of which Cod is advancing our race to the promised glories of the new creation . We look upon their greatness as his gift to us ; upon their gigantic energies as created for the good of our world ; and upon their influence as just so much moral power , exerted for the high ends of human well-being . We trace the gift directly to his hand , and we connect its object as directly with the elevation of man . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we study the Bible , and the further we see into the working of God 's providence , the deeper does our conviction become , that in all the arrangements of our world , and in all his government over us , there is design and convergence in that direction . We see this in the wonderful subserviency to human interests , in-wrought into the very nature of almost every object in the material world . Here man is the central glory . All things are gathered around him , are fitted , in their constitution , to promote his happiness , and are a donation to him for this end . No fact is clearer than this design , this subserviency in nature to the purposes of human well-being . The further we pry into the properties of the different forms of matter , the more of material do we find , which can be turned to this account . This line , we believe , literally goes out through all the earth , and this word to the end of the world . Here there is set a tabernacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , when spoken into being . His they are in every form , and feature , and property , given to them . In the air therefore , and in the earth , in the fire and in the water , there are , we believe , treasured up for man vast resources , upon which he has as yet hardly begun to draw for his accommodation , and advancement in all the circumstances of his existence here . What he has discovered only creates the certainty that the treasure is vast-that the adaptation to human interests is universal . // We have a higher exhibition , however , of this fact in the moral world . We see it in the bestowment , which God makes , of gifts to men ; in their diversity , richness , and peculiarity ; in the powers of intelligence and sagacity , of ingenuity and contrivance , given to individuals , and l ; y which the properties of nature are discovered , adaptations are made , and results produced , which give a mighty impulse to the work of human improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the old economy-men , who made the earth feel their power . During the long period of types and shadows , individuals were raised up , from time to time , whose influence was felt in every part of the Hebrew Commonwealth . From the time of Moses onward to the close of that dispensation , men of giant minds appeared ever and anon on the stage of action-men , filled with the spirit of wisdom and understanding ,  --  prophets , who prepared the way of the Lord , who laid broad and deep the foundations of the social order , and intellectual and moral elevation , attained under the proclamation of the gospel . They sowed the seed , and others . reaped the harvest . They labored and others entered into their labors . One mind was made subservient to the interests of many . And so it has been from that day to this . So it always will be . Giants , therefore , there will be on the earth-mountain elevations in the intellectual world . They form a part of the economy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised up for a peculiar purpose , are placed out far in advance of all others , and act that others may enter into their labors , and thus reach their elevation . Their action , in one way or another , gives an impulse to improvement . It is in thus creating upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of water , that God is providing a supply for the whole earth . Yes , it is in thus creating these greater lights in our firmament , that he is bringing about the time , when the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of seven days ,  --  the time , when the feeble shall be as David , and the house of David shall be as the angel of the Lord . There is a tendency , in this age and country of ours , to bring everything down to a common level . There is danger , therefore , of overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which we lift up our hearts in gratitude to God . Indeed , a man may be so familiar with what is great and sublime as to be unconscious of its influence over him . He may live amid Alpine scenery , and view from his infancy those huge summits which pierce the skies , and have his whole being ennobled by the grandeur , and yet in all the outgoings of his grati voi*. xr. 32 // tude to God , he may never once recognize the mighty agency in nature that has been elevating him  --  the silent but powerful working of the sublimity without upon the whole mass of character within . He may never raise his eye in thankfulness to God for lifting up those mighty elevations . And just so the multitude may feel and act in relation to the influence of great men . They may be affected by it ; they may be elevated in thought , in feeling , and in action , by it ; they may even have their whole existence enriched and ennobled by the work of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fail to raise the heart in grateful emotion to God for the existence and abor of such men . We are not mistaken in this apprehension . The Giver is not remembered in the enjoyment of the gift . The boon awakens no fitting return to Him , who thus secured it to us . Great men are soon forgotten ,  --  men , who have done most to enlighten and bless the world-men , who had in their souls a precious treasure for all coming time , and who sacrificed time , and ease , and life even , to enrich that treasure , have no proper place in the recollections of the many , and their existence , consequently , and their influence , form no part of the public thanksgiving . They enter into the labors of these men and enjoy the benefit , but forget its source . There is indeed a wide , deep gulf between the multitude and the martyrs of science and religion . Thousands have looked at the heavens through the telescope , and have felt themselves ennobled by the grandeur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man , who thus enabled them to see the wonders of the heavens . The educated minds of the world have received an untold advantage from the studies of Tycho and Kepler , and yet how few have thus had their thoughts directed to God in gratitude for the existence of those men ? Millions in England have been enriched , and the resources of the whole country immensely augmented , and the general happiness greatly increased , by the inventions of her Watt , and yet what place has that man in the grateful recollections of those millions ? His country even to this day , we believe , is too poor to erect , in her legislative capacity , a simple monument to his memory  --  a country too , that has , in that capacity , poured out its treasures , and laid them as a grateful offering at the feet of her victorious warrior . We know indeed that great men have not always been wise . Talents have been abused . Energies have been thrown away , or have been enlisted on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lower the estimate of great men in the feelings of the community . But what has been the chaff compared // with the wheat ? What have been the energies thrown away , or enlisted against the truth , when placed along side of those that have been employed in its defense ? What if such men as Herbert , and Shaftesbury , and ilume arrayed their strength against Christianity ? We see mightier energies coming to its defense , in the colossal forms of Bayle , of Newton , and of Doddridge . True , some men of great minds have searched for facts , to array science against religion , and nature against her God . But greater minds have seen further , and with Butler , and Gisborne , and Miller , have demonstrated the harmony of nature with Revelation-of the phenomena of the earth with the statements of the Bible ; have traced the " footprints " even of the Creator in the humblest works of his hand , and brought these demonstrated truths-these trophies of victory  --  and laid them down meekly at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mourn over it , that , in the days of the corrupt Charles , for example , much of the talent of England was on the side of evil , that much of her genius was employed in ridiculing the truth , in pouring contempt upon vital religion . But what were all the talents then prostituted to evil , in comparison with those of that poor , blind Puritan , who , undisturbed by the corrupt tumult around him , " meditated the most sublime and holy work " ever put forth by an inspired man ?  --  a work that will be read and admired , and will exert an influence on the thoughts and feelings of men , when all the profane wit and ribaldry of his day shall have been buried in utter oblivion , and shall have rotted even from the pages that now contain the folly and the blasphemy . The talents , then , which have been abused , take nothing from the force of our statement . They do not abate , in any degree , our obligations of gratitude to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure still remains . Our indebtedness here is very great . Much of the general elevation is owing to the labors of such men . Their discoveries and inventions have often given a mighty impulse to the work of human improvement . Facts prove this . About the middle of the fifteenth century , there was born , in a city on the Mediterranean , one whose soul was filled with a solemn and lofty enthusiasm , and in whose mind a mighty conception began to form , and a mighty purpose to develop itself ere he reached the meridian of life . He cherished the idea he had formed . It grew with his growth , and soon became the settled and deep conviction of his mind . For eighteen long years the hidden fire burned in his bosom alone . He went from place to place , and from one country to another , and tried to kindle its flame in other bosoms , but in vain . He toiled on in the face of poverty , of neg // lect , and of ridicule . The prime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained a listening ear , and was suppli.cd with the means of making out the demonstration , of proving the truth of what had been in his mind from his boyhood almost ,  --  and then a new world burst upon the view of astonished nations . The discovery awoke a slumbering world , gave an impulse to its enterprise , called out its activities , and increased its wealth , its comfort , and its happiness . Oh what a gift to this world was the mind of Columbus ! What untold results were gained in consequence of what he did ! His discovery of a new world not only gave an impulse to the enterprise , and bettered the social condition , of Europe , but it provided a place in the wilderness , whither the elect of God , like the woman in the Apocalypse , were in after days to flee , when pursued by the red dragon of persecution , and where the children of the Covenanter and the Pilgrim were to sow the virgin soil of the new earth with the seed of that harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , and which is gladdening the face of the whole world . Next to the noble Genoese , we would place the names of Fulton and Watt , as the benefactors of their race , as the men , whose inventive genius has ministered most to the social , intellectual , and moral improvement of mankind . Their labors resulted in the creation of a gift , which is the most precious ever given by man to his race . Sure we are , that , when this result of their study and toil is seen in all its applications , and in all its capacity to act for man , the feelings of the reader will be with us in this matter . Let him look at this agent as able to serve us at all times , and in all places , on the arid heath , and on the mountain top-in the deepest mine , and in the heart of the most crowded city-let him see it where it multiplies thought , and manufactures intelligence , and gives the bread of life to the famishing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of men , and put into iron fingers that ply it faster , or where the sail is furled , and the oar is laid down , and the sinews of flesh are dispensed with , and where this unwearied servant , defying tide and tempest , flies with us over sea and land , contracting the watery domain , and bringing distant countries into close proximity , and hastening the day , when all shall be united in the warm charities of a common brotherhood of being ; - yes , let him see this gift in all its relations to human interests , in all its capacity to enlighten and elevate the condition of the whole family of man , and he will lift his heart in thankfulness to God that he gave such inventive talent to Fulton and Watt . // There is a feeling , we know , in the minds of many that a great deduction is to be made from our estimate of progress in this result . They feel that the good is connected with a vast amount of evil ; that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , that the mighty agent , of which we have spoken , often takes to itself its great power , and spreads devastation and death all around . True , there is suffering connected with it ; and yet we doubt whether the loss of life is as great , in proportion to th' number who travel , as it was before this agent was put upon the iron track , and into " the oak leviathans " that plough their way through the deep . A careful examination here will show , we think , that , in this aspect of the case , there is an actual gain in the securities to life . Those who now cross the ocean in ten or twelve days , escape the perils that had formerly to be encountered through thirty , sixty , and not unfrequently ninety days . But it must be borne in mind that the evil here , in most cases at least , results from carelessness and folly , comes from a reckless adventure in overtasking the energies of nature . The gift has indeed the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they disregard the laws of matter , and , for the purposes of pride and ambition , madden the energies of this giant , he may indeed burst from his enclosure , and do his strange work of punishment , and in a fearful manners But in this he is teaching man a mighty lesson . He is demonstrating the fact that he can not transgress the laws of God with impunity , that wrong doing is linked with suffering . But the objection goes yet farther . Many see no real advance in well-being in such results . Their position is that anything , which abridges , or supersedes , the necessity of manual labor , is of no real advantage , that whatever takes employment from men in this way , is even an injury . This , however , is a mistake . The action of the community , we admit , is exceedingly intricate and involved . There are a thousand dependencies . That which affects one man , in affecting him , may involve many others . If an invention took from men all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in which to be engaged , it would indeed injure them . But if it drives them from one mode of action to a higher and better way of life , then it benefits them . Now this is just what God , in his providence , is doing , an ddoing it through just such results . The progress consists in lessening the amount of manual labor , and thus giving time and incentive to the cultivation of the higher qualities of our being . In putting the spindle and the shuttle , for example , into iron fingers , that ply them faster , and greatly cheapen the result , and enable one person to do the work of a hundred , there is // given to the ninety and nine an opportunity of employing their time and energies upon something higher , something which requires more of the mind , and less of the physical strength . Every substitution of machinery , therefore , for manual labor raises man higher in the sphere of action , is a change from the physical to the mental-from matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it closes up one channel of labor , it necessarily opens another , and through a richer domain , and with a wider and more beneficial 6utlet . " It is the mind that makes the man . " In the cultivation of this , we rise in the scale of being . The heart , therefore , ought to go out in gratitude to God for the inventive genius he has given to men . It is connected with good , is the means of spreading truth and righteousness over the earth . Bacon complained in his day that science could hardly boast of a single triumph , which served to increase the power , to diminish the suffering , or to augment the happiness , of mankind . Could that prince of philosophers now return to our world , he would see a vast change in these respects , effected in consequence of the direction he gave to the thoughts of men , in turning them away from the subtelties of a false philosophy , and fixing them upon the facts in each case . He would see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inductive reasoning . Every one , familiar with the history of England , knows what immense suffering and loss of life were formerly connected with the coaleries of that land . Vast numbers were employed in those places . Down in the deep caverns of the earth , and in the midst of their toil , there collected a gaseous substance , which , when it came in contact with fire , instantly exploded , and with the violence of a magazine of gunpowder . It gave no warning of its approach , and there was no escape from its terrible effects . Hundreds were in a moment dashed to pieces , and whole villages clothed in mourning . The frequency and extent of these disasters led men to think seriously of abandoning this great source of the nation 's wealth . This state of things attracted the attention of one of the most gifted sons of science . He repaired to the scene of this suffering , and obtained some of that explosive gas . He analyzed it-ascertained its properties . One experiment led to another , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamp , " which , while it defends him perfectly from a force , that , in its effects , rivals the lightning and the earthquake , at the same time converts the destroyer into the means of greater light to him , and greater facilities in prosecuting his work in the deep caverns *of the earth . It is indeed a most benevolent gift of science to a class of men , // who are the farthest removed from its influence . When can the grateful miner , or the benevolent heart , forget the name of Davy , or cease to thank God for his existence , and for the work of his hands . We should do injustice to our subject , and to our feelings too , were we , in this connection , to pass in silence the greatest triumph of inventive genius , and profound thinking , in modern times . We allude to that mode of communication , which has literally annihilated time and space , and which flashes intelligence over land , and under the sea , and from continent to continent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mighty agent from the clouds , and tamed iL . But Morse has made it speak-has given it a tongue-an utterance as exact and as intelligible as that of the human voice . Some may indeed look upon this only as an ingenious contrivance for the communication of commercial intelligence , and value it mainly for the facilities it affords for the speedy transaction of business . We think it has higher claims to our regard . We look upon it as having most important moral relations-as connected with , and bearing upon , the brotherhood and the virtue of the world . God has made of one blood all the nations of the earth , and he is , in one way and another , bringing them together into nearest neighborhood , and thus into sympathy with their common origin , and their common destiny . It is even yet true , however , that " Lands intersected by a narrow frith Abhor each other . Mountains interposed Make enemies of nations , who had else Like kindred drops been mingled into one . " In the employment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness of truth , in freighting the lightning with intelligence , in thus flashing thought and feeling over the earth , God , in his providence , is removing these mountains , and annihilating these friths , and bringing about the time , when there shall be no more sea ,  --  the time , when man will talk with his fellow on the other side of the globe , and when the men in Seir may again ask , Watchman , what of the night , and receive from some Israelite at his antipodes the same answer , The morning cometh and also the night  --  the morning to us , and the night to you . This invention has other moral bearings . It exerts a mighty influence in favor of virtue , in the restraints which it puts upon evil . It makes it much harder for a man to be dishonest now , than it once was . It does this in taking so much from the hope of impunity , and in thus lessening the temptation to wrong ac // tion . Once a man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrunning the intelligence of his infamy . But that day is past . Concealment now is almost impossible . If a man does a wicked act , and flies from the scene of his guilt , the news flies faster , is at any place before he arrives there , is dotted down at every point and important station , and along every thoroughfare in the land . If he goes forward , it meets him . If he goes backward , it is there . If he turns to the right hand , or to the left , it is there also . It anticipates every step he takes , and works against him in every place . It makes the whole land to know him , for it flashes his likeness in every direction , and thus creates the man in a thousand different localities , and hangs up his image in every bar-room and police office through the country . It spreads all over the land a network of intelligence , which is sure to catch and to hold the evil doer . It is indeed one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest sympathy with his own omniscient glance . It is swifter than the wings of the morning . It flies to the uttermost parts of the sea . It makes the night light about men , and to it the darkness and the light are both alike . We thank God for the mind that conceived the blessing . There is , however , a higher range in the influence of great men . In the sentiments they put forth , in the spirit they breathe-in the direction thus given to thought , and in the elevation thus imparted to feeling-immense good has been done . Bacon , in teaching men how to reason and investigate , in guiding aright their search after wisdom , and in thus bringing about " the happy match between the mind of man and the nature of things , " made himself the benefactor of the whole human family . Luther , in exposing the absurdities of the Schoolmen and the impostures of Rome , in putting reason in the place of scholasticism , and the Bible in the place of the decisions of councils-Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates of error , and bearing them off , did a work which made heaven and earth glad , and which places him among the richest gifts of God to man . Calvin , in bringing to the interpretation of the Bible his profound knowledge , his acuteness of reasoning , and his mighty grasp of intellect-Calvin , in penetrating into the inner sanctuary of divine truth , and in bringing out the pure Word of God , free from all the perversions of a thousand years , stands out in advance of all who preceded him , as the greatest and best of men  --  the richest blessing of uninspired wisdom in all the ascension gifts , which the Saviour had given to his church and to the world . And Stuart  --  a name that will not soon be forgotten , in awakening attention to the study of the // Scriptures in the original-in teaching men to " read the Bible in the language of the cross "  --  and in thus rescuing the Word of God from the grasp of " an ironhanded metaphysics , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholastic philosophy ,  --  Stuart , in " alluring young men to become themselves the instructors of the community , and inspiring them with the love of the gospel , and in qualifying them to translate it into other tongues ,  --  in instilling into them an earnest desire to open this treasure before their wondering fellow-men , and in sending them forth year after year to the east and the west , the north and the south , " - Stuart did a work which eternity alone can fully develop . He thus became , in the glowing language of Prof. Park , " a teacher of teachers , himself a missionary , perarnbulating amoi*g the dark places of the earth , going from the wigwams of the West to the city of Constantine , and in a kind of moral ubiquity unfolding the varied truths , which he has gathered up in his still retreat . On one and the same Sabbath , through a hundred ministers , to Parthians and Medes , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and Cappadocia , in Pontus and Asia ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Arabians , he is speaking in their own tongues the wonderful works of God . " This is indeed living to some purpose-is making the whole earth glad . Immense good has been done by great men in the literature they created , in the rich legacy of thought and feeling left by them to all coming time . In all countries , and from age to age , God has given existence to men , remarkable for their talents and erudition ,  --  men of vast compass and reach of understanding , and endowed with powers creative and original , who made great additions to the material , upon which the minds of men in succeeding ages have been employed , and by which taste has been formed , and reason enlightened , and feeling disciplined to right action . They are the great schoolmasters of the world . The resources , created by them , form the common fund from which whole generations draw their intelligence and their wisdom . The works of these master-spirits , whose force , boldness , and originality surprise us , and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compose our libraries , are our intellectual nutriment  --  the mighty sentiments with which we commune in secret , and , in musing upon which we feel something of the same fire burning in our own souls , and thus have the intellect and the heart enlarged and ennobled . What a blessing , therefore , to the world , was the intellectual elevation given , in the providence of God , to individuals in Greece and Rome ! Their works have been school books in all // the enlightened places of the earth for more than a thousand years . They are to this day the models of taste to which we dIscipline the minds of our youth . No better can be found . Homer and Virgil , Plato and Tully , still hold the preeminence in all the high places of learning . What a gift , then , to men were the giant minds of Greece and Rome ! What an impulse was given to the work of mental improvement , in the creation of that brightest constellation in the intellectual firmament ! A good book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rescues its author from death . It translates him , not to heaven , but to a higher sphere of usefulness upon earth . It continues him among men , and enables him to speak when his body is in th' dust . The great men of the world , therefore , are still with us . We have in our houses , and by our firesides , Baxter and Howe , Milton and Cowper , Newton and Edwards . We have still with us loved and revered names , Alexander and Stuart ,  --  men , who continue to instruct us by their wisdom , and to cheer us on by their example ,  --  men , who tell us of a better country and of a higher life ,  --  of greater light and brighter visions of truth and of God . But more than this is true . A book not only continues its author thus upon the earth , but it is in the same sense the creation of just as many such men , as there are copies of his work circulating among men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good men of all ages . They are the inmates of every abode of intelligence , and are gathered in greatest numbers into those places , where the young mind learns to reason , to feel , to act . Johnson , most infelicitously for himself , fancies the poor , blind bard of Britain , after completing his immortal work , as musing upon the future of his Paradise Lost , upon its reception among men , and its influence in all coming time . Well might he muse , and with intense emotion too , upon that future , so bright with promise , so fraught with good to man . Well might he exult at the thought of thus continuing among men , and of thus pouring into their minds , from one generation to another , this stream of pure and elevated thought , and of thus " asserting eternal Providence , and justifying the ways of God to man , " even to the end of the world . We may not indeed be selfish , or glory in our own strength , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reason for rejoicing . Could the poor tinker in Bedford jail have fully realized what God was preparing for men through him ; could he have seen the future of what he was then meditating ; could he have seen that it would soon become the companion of an innumerable company of pilgrims ; that it would be translated into foreign tongues , and go wherever the // Bible goes , and be esteemed only less than the visions of his namesake in Patmos ; could he have seen this , and seen it as the result of the ways in which God was leading him , and as the fruit that came into being from the experience , the mental agony , and the depths of despair , through which he passed , in passing into the sunshine of hope and of joyous life ,  --  Bunyan 's soul would have leaped for joy . He would then have looked upon his dungeon as a palace , upon his imprisonment as the season of his greatest usefulness , and upon all his agony of soul as the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his labors , when he was composing his " songs for children , " and when there flowed from the full , deep fountain of celestial melody in his soul , those higher and richer strains , which are now sung in every Christian land , and which , we doubt not , will continue to be the medium of devout praise to God to the end of time ; could Watts have seen this issue of his efforts-seen , that , in touching the harp of David , he was drawing from it " sweeter tones than it has ever given to the church of God since the hand of the old Hebrew swept across its strings , and enkindled the devotions of the faithful , " then , next to his exultation around the throne of the Lamb , would have been his rejoicing on earth . In the literature , then , of great men , there is accumulated a vast amount of good for our world . True , there may be found in it sentiments , which we are not willing to endorse , teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . We may not be willing to go with Luther in his stubborn literality respecting the real presence , nor with Calvin in his views concerning the Sabbath . We may refuse to follow Edwards to the ne plus ultra of his necessarian scheme , or to side with Chalmers in his advocacy of ecclesiastical establishments . We may have no sympathy with Alexander in his limitation of the atonement , or with Stuart in his exegesis of the seventh of Romans . But what if we dissent here . Does our dissent make the literature of these great men useless to us ? What are these things , when viewed in connection with their whole teaching ? What are they , when seen in the light which these men pour upon the truth of God , and the path of our duty ? - spots merely in the disk of a glorious orb of light and heat to our world . We no more think of them , nor suffer them to lessen our estimate of the boon we have in their labors , than we do the dark places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheered by its genial warmth . The testimony of great men to the truth of the Bible , and to the worth of religion , is connected with the highest good of our // race . Their connections here are of great value . They thoroughly weighed the evidences of Revelation ; they saw far into the wants of the human soul . The testimony , therefore , of such men as Boyle , and Newton , and Hale , upon these points , is of immense benefit to our world . It sets aside the sneer of ignorance , and makes the shallow minds of infidels afraid to touch the ark of God . It matters not ) in this aspect , what the life of great men may have been . They may have gone contrary to their better reason-may have lived in the face of all their convictions of duty . All this may be true , and however we may regret it and weep over it , yet it does not at all lessen the value of their testimony to the truth of the Bible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest hour , when men are themselves ,  --  when passion ceases , and reason is on the throne ,  - -  the hour , when truth and eternity come into communion , and when the soul of man thinks and feels aright , and speaks out its convictions , and confesses its wants . In no act , therefore , of his long and useful life , did the great civilian of the West do more for his country , and for the weal of the whole human family , than he did in laying himself down at the feet of Jesus as a lost sinner , in trusting in his blood for eternal life , and in thus saying to the world , Here is my trust-here my only hope . In no exhibition of his giant intellect did the idol of New England ever give expression to words of higher import , or of more lasting importance to mankind , than he did , when he said , and said to listening thousands , " Religion is a necessary and indispensable element in any great human character . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds him to his throne . if that tie be sundered , or broken , he floats away a worthless atom in the universe , its proper attraction all gone , its destiny and its whole futurQ nothing but darkness , desolation , and despair . " Mighty words these ! In them Webster will live , and do good till the heavens , it may be , are no more . We might say much in relation to the influence for good which great men have exerted in infusing new life into the church , in giving increased efficiency to her action , and a higher spirituality to her devotion . Did our limits permit , we might speak of what Whitfield and Edwards accomplished in this work ; of what Buchanan and Mills effected for the cause of missions ; and of what Chalmers wrought out in his day for the church of Scotland , in bringing the minds of the people back to those doctrines , which give life , and in thus awakening in that land a spirit , unseen there since the days of the Covenanter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slain for // the testimony of Jesus ,  --  a piety that is now making itself felt all over the earth . We might speak of others , but we must stop . The theme is inexhaustable . The whole we shall not see until the books are opened , and the extent of this goodness is spread out for the benefit of the universe , and for the glory of Him , who wrought it all through the instrumentality of great men .
