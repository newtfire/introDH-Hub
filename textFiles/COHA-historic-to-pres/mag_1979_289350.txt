Charges of kickbacks and cover-ups in Japanese TV imports <P> " The Executive Branch has neither the will nor the means to enforce the antidumping laws . " <P> - Zenith Chairman John Nevin <P> America 's TV manufacturers have long been bitter about the flood of Japanese television sets into the U.S. For nearly ten years , they have insisted that these imports , which last year totaled 2.8 million sets and captured 40% of the market , have been illegally " dumped , " sold at cheap prices way below those charged in Japan . But the last three Administrations have been strangely deaf to the industry 's plaints . Investigations into the charges have been halted , and dumping duties that should have been collected have not been . Now , at the prodding of Congress , the Carter Administration 's attitude is changing . Meanwhile , evidence is emerging of lax enforcement of the trade rules and possible malfeasance by past and present Administration officials . <P> Last week the Treasury Department made a long delayed move to collect some back dumping tariffs . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties on color TV sets that were brought in to the country between six and eight years ago . The department was clearly acting under pressure . Ohio Democrat Charles Vanik , who heads a House subcommittee on trade , has called for hearings on the dumping issue . At the same time , federal grand juries in New York City , Norfolk , Va. , and Los Angeles , as well as a Justice Department task force in Chicago , are hearing federal allegations that several large retailers , notably Sears , Montgomery Ward and J.C . Penney , have accepted illegal Japanese kickbacks . <P> <P> These payments were supposedly designed to disguise the true extent of the dumping , which , according to U.S. Customs officials , was most intense during and after the mid-1970s recession . The kickbacks allegedly worked this way : manufacturers quoted a high official wholesale price but then made illicit payments to their U.S. importers that enabled them to undercut the retail price of American-made TVs by as much as $100 . Customs officials and Government lawyers say that virtually all Japanese manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . The U.S. importers-such as the large retailers and the U.S. subsidiaries of Matsushita , Sharp , Sanyo and Toshiba-could be required to pay dumping duties totaling $500 million owed on $2 billion worth of sets imported since 1971 . In addition , the U.S. &shy; owned retailers could face civil fraud penalties totaling $1 billion and criminal fines of $5,000 for each shipment of TVs brought in under a false import declaration . But the prospect is for a less painful out-of-court settlement . Says one Treasury lawyer : " Nobody wants to see the Government take over Sears . "
