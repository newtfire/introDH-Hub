A huge telescope under construction in a remote West Virginia valley will listen for whispers from the heavens . // OPERATORS OF the largest telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank , West Virginia , knew something was wrong when pieces of the control room ceiling began falling on November 15 , 1988 . Soon afterward , the 26-year-old telescope , with a dish antenna 300 feet in diameter , collapsed under its own weight . Years worth of research had to be put on hold while astronomers scrambled to apply for observing time on smaller telescopes . The only good news for astronomers was that Congress quickly granted the observatory $75 million to begin building a replacement , thanks largely to the influence of Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia , the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee . Finally nearing completion , the new Green Bank Telescope is not only bigger than its predecessor - it will be the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the worldbut also uses a radical newv design that wv1 ill make it easier to detect xN radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " listen " to radio signals , any more than your car 's radio listens to FI stations . In both cases , the antenna simply collects radio waves . But a radio telescope uses a large dish , instead of a rod or wire , for that purpose . And instead of translating radio waves into sounds , the telescope turns them into graphs or images that astronomers can use to observe distant objects in the universe .

Photograph // The radio signals collected by the Green Bank Telescope can tell astronomers about the molecular components of these distant objects . Astronomers can then study molecules in the regions where new stars are forming , for example , to learn more about this process . The telescope will also help astronomers find pulsars , spinning neutron stars that throw out radio beams like a lighthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probe the properties of interstellar space . The telescope could even be used to listen for messages from extraterrestrial civilizations . The radio signals coming from objects in distant galaxies are very faint , so astronomers need huge antennas to capture these signals . If you took all the radio energy falling on all the radio telescopes around the world and put it together , it would n't be enough to power a light bulb . But the bigger the telescope , the more weak radio signals it can collect-just as a larger bucket collects more raindrops . With a dish 100 meters across , the new Green Bank Telescope will be among the largest in the world . Astronomers joke that its abbreviation , GBT , actually stands for Great Big Telescope . But size is n't everything : The GBT 's shape is what makes it more efficient than another telescope of the same size located in Effelsberg , Germany . " What 's so different about the GBT is its offset feed arm , " explains Mark McKinnon , a scientist at the Green Bank observatory site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio signals on a receiver suspended above the center of the dish on support arms . The receiver , like the eyepiece of an optical telescope , collects the focused radio waves . But the support arms block some of the incoming radio signals from reaching the dish . With the offset design , that wo n't happen . Also , the telescope wo n't be as susceptible to the interference generated by nearby ground-based radio sources . The GBT is like a jumbo version of a pizza-size satellite TV dish . The surface of the antenna is 100 meters wide and 110 meters long , and the receiver arm is off to one side of the dish . But while a TV dish antenna is made from a single piece of metal , the GBT 's dish consists of some 2,000 aluminum panels that are pieced together to create smooth surface . Needless to say , the GBT is a lot heavier than a satellite TV dish-about 16 million pounds heavier . Like any large radio telescope , the GBT is so heavy that it deforms under its own weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to hold out your arm for a long time with a weight on it , " says McKinnon . The solution : beefed-up arm muscles . A network of welded steel beams , weighing up to 200 tons apiece , supports the dish and feed arm . Photograph If the rangefinder detects that a panel is misaligned , it cues the actuator to adjust the panel by as much as an inch . The entire surface can be fine-tuned in about 8 minutes . // The telescope is rotated by four tank-size trucks that move along a track encircling the antenna . The antenna changes elevation by moving on a semicircular gear . The telescope operator sits in a control room inside the observatory 's office building . The windows of the room are impregnated with metal mesh , and its walls have copper wallpaper-all to shield the telescope , 2.5 kilometers away , from unwanted electronic signals generated by computers and other equipment in the room . Data and control signals travel back and forth between the telescope and the control room on optical fibers . The GBT can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from about 100 megahertz to 100 gigahertz . At higher frequencies , however , deformations in the surface of the telescope 's antenna can distort the signals received . These deformations can be caused not only by gravity ( when the telescope is tipped ) , but also by temperature ( for example , if part of the antenna is in the sun while another part is shaded ) . The deformations caused by gravity are predictable , but the thermal deformations are not . To measure them , rangefinders mounted on the feed arm bounce laser beams off reflective targets on the dish surface . The telescope then corrects for any deformations using motor-driven actuators placed at each corner where four of the antenna 's panels meet . These actuators can move the panels by as much as an inch , and can be adjusted almost instantaneously . Astronomers will also try to minimize the effects of sun and wind by scheduling most of their high-frequency observations for the calmest , driest nights of the year-generally in the dead of winter . Accurate pointing is essential to high-frequency observations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rangefinders on the ground bounce beams off retroreflectors on the telescope 's structure to point the telescope with an accuracy approaching one second of an arc-the width of a dime when seen from a mile away . When will astronomers get their hands on this amazing instrument ? A sign at the observatory 's visitor center says the GBT is " projected to be completed in 1996 and operational in 1997 . " Both of the dates were missed due to contractual problems . However , it 's safe to say that the telescope will be finished soon , although months of testing will be required before it is turned over to scientists . 4 Quiet , Please CELLPHONES do n't work in Green Bank , West Virginia , home of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory . That 's because Green Bank is Located near the heart of the National Radio Quiet Zone , a 13,000-square-mile area established to protect the observatoryand a classified Naval facility about 30 miles east of it-from signals that interfere with radio telescopes and other sensitive electronic equipment . Green Bank was chosen as the tocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielded by high mountains , and Lacked potential for development . The world 's only Quiet Zone was established at the same time . Today , Frequency Coordinator Wesley A. Sizemore is responsible for ensuring that signals from radio transmitters within the zone do n't ruin telescope observations . Sizemore reviews applications for FCC Licenses , and sometimes requests changes . He may , for example , ask cellphone companies or broadcast stations to install special antennas that do n't radiate signals toward Green Bank . Recently , he convinced a nearby ski resort to drop its plans for a wireless computer network . When astronomers are using a radio telescope for Low-frequency observations , even an electric fence or a spark plug can interfere with their work . That 's why staffers use bicycles and a fleet of dilapidated diesel cars and trucks to get around the observatory . Sometimes Sizemore even has to set out in a pickup truck bristling with antennas to track down troublesome signals . One signal Led him to a coupLe in a nearby town who were keeping their old dog warm with a heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only provides protection from ground-based transmitters . Sizemore ca n't do anything about the pay phones on airplanes , for example . " If ET calls on 895 megahertz , we 'll never hear him , " says Sizemore . " We 'll just hear someone calling from 30,000 feet . " Photograph Wesley Sizemore tracks down transmitters that Interfere with radio telescopes . // Wireless technologies are proLiferating so rapidly that astronomers fear they will soon be enveloped in a radio " fog " that wilt cut them off from the universe . " The Quiet Zone is a national resource Like Yellowstone , " says Sizemore . " It 's a wilderness . Once it 's gone , it 's gone forever . " - D.S . <p>
