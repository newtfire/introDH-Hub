The Cabinet , I hear , was actually in session at the President 's house , where they dined en famille , deliberating upon the latest advices , but the nature of these has not as yet transpired . NOTHING SERIOUS APPREHENDED . " From the Memphis Appeal , Nov.16 . We apprehend nothing sedans from the recent outbreak in East Tennessee but regard it , on the contrary , at least in point of time , as one of the most fortunate incidents of the crisis . It was evidently one act in a carefully arranged programme of the enemy , all of whose parts were to have been executed simultaneously , but which has eventuated in a miserable abortion . We have long been aware that there sys a deeply disaffected element in this section of the State , and have repeatedly pressed upon our authorities  --  State and Federal  --  the necessity of exercising a proper espionage over their movements . A traitorous combination , headed by BROWNLOW , Taswuir , and other lesser lights , and in league with the exiles JOHNSON and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the enemy , and cognizant of his project to attempt the invasion of Tennessee through Cumberland Gap or some other inlet through that range of mountains . It was a stroke of policy merely that induced the abandonment of the Greenville Convention and the ostensible acknowledgment of the Confederate Government by the , arch conspirators who were encouraging this scheme . In fact , it was a most dangerous part of their conspiracy , inasmuch as it disarmed our authorities , and the adherents of our cause in that section , of all vigilance . They thought that the refractory spirit of the rebellion that at first showed its head had been permanently quelled , and looked for no further manifestation of it . This insurrection , however , while comparatively harmless from its being premature , gives evidence of a deep-laid plot among a few of the most reckless traitors of that region to resist the sovereign voice of the people of the - State by force of arms , so soon as they have hope of assistance from the Lincoln des . potism . It is fortunate that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully able to put a lasting quietus upon it , from which no appliances of future Federal aid will ever be able to resuscitate it . We slow have an open foe to conquer , who is rendered , Impotent by the very disclosure of his hostility  --  and not less so by his isolation . ARRESTS AND MARTIAL LAW . Tihe Appeal , of Nov. 16 , has these paragraphs , wMeh show that it was thought expedient to resort to stringent measures : " We learn from private dispatches that Chattanooga has been placed under martial law . Several arrests have been made . One regiment has been placed at Hiawasse , to guard the railroad . Gen. CAtaou 's Brigade will move at an early day from Chattanooga . Major F. S. HENKEL , a prominent Unionist of East Tennessee , has been arrested on a charge of inciting rebellion . He has been held to $20,000 bail for his appearance at the Confederate Court . " PROCLAMATION OF GOV . HARRIS . To the People of Tennessee : The State must , and , to the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with in ! Lesion , all good citizens will regard it as a patriotic duty to make any reasonable sacrifice to repel the infader . Regiments are now in camp and organized , while others are ready to organize , bit for want of arms are not prepared to take the field . Prompted by the noblest impulses of patriotism , these brave men are ready-to take the field to defend your homes , and to prevent the theatre of this cruel and vindictive war being brought within our borders . They appeal to you who quietly remain at home , to place arms in their hands , that they may give you protection and security . If you fail to respond to this appeal , I shall be compelled , by the sternest convictions of duty , charged as 1 am with the responsibility of seeing that the State is defended , to disband these regiments of brave soldiers , and call you who have arms into service as militia . I earnestly entreat that the people will bring forward and deliver to the Clerk of the County Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may send to the various counties , every effective doublebarrel shot-gun and sporting ride which they hare , to be immediately shipped to the a:senal at Nashville , Knoxville , or Memphis , where the same will be valued by a competent ordnance officer , and the value paid to the owner by the Confederate Government . I urge you to give me your aid in the important work of arming our troops , with which we can repel i he invader , but if you refuse , prepare to take the eld. for I am resolved to exhaust all resources be-ore the foot of the invader shall pollute the soil of Tennessee . Respectfully , ISHAM G. HARRIS . EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT , ' NASHVILLE , Nov. 12 , 1S61 . FOR DEFENCE . The Nashville Union states that Mr. CARE , of Franklin , has introduced a bill into the House of Representatives , to provide for the defence of the State , which confers upon the Governor the power to impress into the service all shot-guns and rifles , to be paid for when the volunteers are disbanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also provides for calling 10,000 volunteers into the State , to serve for twelve months , unless sooner discharged . This force may be increased to 20,000 men , if the Governor deems the exigency shall require it . We are hopeful of some measure , substantially containing the provisions of this bill , passing at an early day .
