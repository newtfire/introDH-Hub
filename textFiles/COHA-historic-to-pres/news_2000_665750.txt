A court judge in southern China has been held in a psychiatric hospital and forced to take narcotics for refusing to renounce his belief in the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement , a rights group said Friday . <p> The case of Huang Jinchun is the latest troubling sign that the communist government is using mental institutions to punish political or religious dissenters . <p> Huang displayed no symptoms of mental illness either at work or since being sent to the hospital nearly three months ago , the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported , citing former colleagues and nurses . <p> But at the Longqianshan Psychiatric Hospital in the southern Guangxi region , after Huang continued to practice Falun Gong , medical personnel gave him daily injections of a narcotic that left him sleepy and muddled , the rights group said . <p> " The doctors and nurses made fun of me : ' Are n't you practicing Falun Gong ? Let us see which is stronger , Falun Gong or our medicines ? " ' Huang related in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gong Web site . <p> The accounts could not be independently verified . Government , court and hospital administrative offices and courts were closed Friday for the Lunar New Year holiday . <p> Hospital authorities allowed Huang to go home Feb. 4 for a 10-day stay over the holiday , and he is being kept under close surveillance , the Information Center said . <p> His case underscores both how popular Falun Gong became even among educated officials the Communist Party entrusts to carry out policy and how desperate the government has become in trying to eradicate the sect 's influence . <p> Founded by an ex-government grain clerk in 1992 , Falun Gong attracted millions of followers with its mix of slow-motion meditation exercises , Buddhist and Taoist cosmology and message of moral living . <p> Fearful of the group 's popularity and its ability to mobilize thousands of followers for protests , Chinese leaders banned the group 6 1-2 months ago as a menace to public order and party rule . Yet protests persist despite a crackdown that has seen thousands sent to labor camps and top group leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Huang , a judge in the civil trials division of the Intermediate People 's Court in Beihai , left the busy port city on the Tonkin Gulf last September to join hundreds of fellow Falun Gong practitioners protesting the ban in Beijing , the Information Center said . <p> Arrested in Beijing , Huang was sent back to Beihai and detained for 15 days , according to his own account . It said the court fired him on Nov. 8 for refusing to sever his ties with Falun Gong and a week later two police took him from his home to the Longqianshan hospital in Liuzhou city , 300 kilometers ( 180 miles ) to the north . <p> The Information Center described Longqianshan as a the biggest mental institution in Guangxi region , holding hundreds of patients and managed in the style of a prison . <p> China has not been known to routinely warehouse dissenters in psychiatric hospitals as was commonly done in the Soviet Union . But sporadic reports indicate that the practice does occur . <p> Police returned a veteran political dissident , Wang Wanxing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he threatened to tell foreign reporters about his seven years confinement there . <p> In December , about 50 Falun Gong members were taken to a different mental institution outside Beijing and held for six weeks .
