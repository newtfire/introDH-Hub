THE moral constitution of the universe presents a problem that has perplexed the philosophers of all ages . When the mind of any one at all disposed to reflection , begins to expand itself and rise above merely physical and sensible things , it looks out from its new elevation with an anxious curiosity for the relations and prospects of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and the youth has felt the force of moral relations with the promptness of instinct , yet the man would fain contemplate the same subjects from a new point of // view , and teach himself the great truths he had been taught by others , or which had spontaneously sprung up in his mind as essential to his being . He examines the grounds of his belief , not merely as matter of curious speculation , but as the basis of his strongest hopes and fears . He ventures to ask himself if this is an orphan universe , and whether , when the body is struck by time , the mind is exhaled and dispersed like the odor of a flower that is crushed . The mere assumption of a doubt for the purpose of the inquiry , is painful to him , for it presents to his mind illimitable space , dark , desolate and blank ; void of the benignity , the almightiness and the perfect intellicrence of the Supreme , and his own existence as a transient flame , and his moral constitution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate his actions to which there are to be no corresponding consequences . He must imagine his being as withered , its beauty departed , and the universe a vain spectacle shorn of its glory . The very dreariness of such a view frightens thousands at once from its contemplation , and is of itself a sufficient argument forever to establish their faith in a God , their own immortality , and a moral retribution ; while others though not satisfied , are yet predisposed to believe . All men above the stupidity of the beasts , - excepting a few who studiously brurify their own minds , to the loss of the perception of all that is not physical and grossly material , out of a poor conceit of their own wisdom , - cling to their moral and immortal affinity to the Deity . The teacher of Natural Theology then has , for the most part , a willing audience , desirous to give their assent to his doctrines ; but his task is not therefore easy . The inquiry leads far away from experience and accustomed speculation into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seized by the understanding , and apt to elude the power of language . Lord Brougham gives the following reasons for writing his treatise . " The composition of this Discourse was undertaken in conse*uence of an observation which I had often made , that scientific men were apt to regard the study of Natural Religion as little connected with philosophical pursuits . Many of the persons to whom I allude , were men of religious habits of thinking ; others were free from any disposition towards skepticism , rather because they had not much discussed the subject , than because they had // formed fixed opinions upon it after inquiry . But the bulk of them relied little upon Natural Theology , which they seemed to regard as a speculation built rather on fancy than on argument ; or , at any rate , as a kind of knowledge quite different from either physical or moral science . It therefore appeared to me desirable to define , more precisely than had yet been done , the place and the claims of Natural Theology among the various branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly undertakes to show that Natural Theology is a science resting on inductive reasoning , on which a number of other sciences and a greater part of what we call knouledge depends . The work , therefore , does not profess to be a mere exposition of the doctrines of Natural Theology , and the evidence by which they are established , but is , rather a learned commentary upon both , somewhat after the model of Sir James Mackintosh 's " Progress of Ethical Science . " It is a logical criticism ; a species of philosophizing upon philosophy . It may rightly be called the metaphysics of Natural Theology . It is an arduous department of speculation , of precarious success ; for although the sciences of logic and metaphysics are , when pursued in the usual method , highly interesting and instructive , a writer runs great hazard of being tediotis , who undertakes to through series of connected arxuments classi go a fying then ) , according to their species , and weighing and incasuring their force . It requires great felicity of style , and address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sagacity and learning , to secure and reward the reader*s attention . It seems to be an unpromising task to instruct the reader how demonstrative or satisfactory a given course of reasoning may be , for he has already felt its full force , if he understands it and if the argument is not intelligible to him or does not lead him to the intended conclusion , he will profit little by the information that this is inductive reasoning , this bein*. , precisely what his teacher has already told him at school . We do not mean to say that very elegant and pleasing essays of this kind , replete with instruction , may not be written , and a more opportune occasion could not be chosen in respect to Natural Theology , than just on the publication of the Bridgewater Treatises ; we mean merely that , to be successful , such essays must be written with consurflfl ) ate skill , from abundant stores of learning , and must abound in striking reflections . A review of such a speculative commentary is liable to he // less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighten the labor then of following Lord Brougham in his difficult attempt , and , with the hope of being more useful to general readers , we purpose to give , in connexion with our remarks upon his book , an outline of what we understand to be the main links of the argument for Natural Theology , which is the foundation of ethical science ; and this involves moral obligation arising out of the constitution of man , his relation to the Creator , to men and to the system of things . This we are the more disposed to , since a speculative air has been given to this science by the very learned and curious inquiries which have been introduced into the discussion , since tl ) e publication of the work of Denham , in which , as Lord Bmou*ham justly remarks , all Dr. Paley 's grounds of argument are pre-occu pied , so that the latter , without any expense of thinking , had only to put the materials , ready furnished to his hands , into a new form , or rather into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of the works of both are substantially the same . A no less learned and scientific air has been given to these speculations in the Bridgewater Treatises , which are highly meritorious works , that may be read with great profit by every body , being full of instruction not only in Natural Theology but also in other sciences , from which illustrations of design in creation are particularly drawn . But still the general reader needs first to connect the leading steps in the reasoning , by having them brought near together , or else he may go through with the whole of these beautiful speculations and still doubt what is the precise force of the reasoning , and he may even be bewildered in the infinitude of the subject as thus treated , and think as Lord Brougham suggests , " that the whole argument is more fanciful than logical . " The first step in Natural Theology is to adopt a theory of the existence of the world . We have a choice of two different theories , 1 . That matter is from eternity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved from its essential properties , and have been coeval and eternal with it . 2 . That matter itself , and all its forms , animal , vegetable , and mineral , have been created , that is , that there is a God . We see , then , that whichever hypothesis is adopted , we must suppose something to have existed without a cause and without beginning . This is intelligible , the meaning is plain ; but the proposition is an exception to all our other knowledge // and belief . Though we can not comprehend how it can be so , we are necessarily reduced to the admission . Neither the theist , the atheist , or , which is the same , tl ) e pantheist , undertakes to solve the enigma of the universe . Each must in the outset confess and believe in a mystery . He must admit sometl ) ing unfathomable and incomj ) relensible to the human mind ; tl ) at is , the existence of some thing or some being without beginning . This is the common predicament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or irreligion . The proposition is common to them all , that the origin of things can he traced back only into the obscurity of a fathomless , incomprehensible past . This familiar fundamental position in the theory of the origin of things renders reasonings and modes of expression , that are applicable on other subjects , totally inapplicable to this . lATe say , for instance , in all speculations , in regard to all other subjects whatsoever , that every thing that is , must have a cause ; but in discussing the origin of things , we can not say so , for whether we assume that matter was eternal , or that all living forms are only the present links in a chain that had no first links , or that all was formed by an iiitelligent cause without a beginning , that is by the omnipotent and eternal Deity , still we assume equally , in either case , either that matter was not caused , or the chain of beings was originally not caused , or that the Deity was not caused . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the common maxim , that whatever is , is determined to be what it is by a cause , we utter an inapplicable proposition . We have not named among the hypotheses from which a choice may be made , that of the eternal existence of mere inorganic matter , or primordial atoms , because it explains nothing and accounts for nothing . A forming , creative power is still wanted to account for the origin of the species of animals and plants . It is true , the Epicureans and Stoics undertook fiorn this postulate only of prinordial atoms of various forms and properties , to explain the origin of the vegetable and animal species , and taught that the earth , before it had become sterile by age , and while it was yet in the genial period of its freshness and vigor , after the first specimens of the vegetable species had germinated from her fruitful bosom , became literally the mother of the animal races , giving birth to all sorts of forms , some perfect , others mixed and monstrous , the perfect only // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective races , through the series of their descendants , when their common parent , should lose l*er l ) rolific powers by senility and decay . This is all sung in beautiful verse by Lucretius , and is indeed a fit subject for poetry only , for we have no knowledge or ground of conjecture that a new species can originate in the powers and properties of matter . Except for the purposes of poetry , the hypothesis of the eternity of mere matter is sterile and useless . We are , accordingly , reduced to a choice of one of the two hypotheses already mentioned , namely , that the series of the present races of animals and vegetables had no beginning , or that there is a Creator ; and these are we believe the only two hypotheses seriously proposed . What then is there to recommend the theory of an eternal series of living things ? Whether we choose this , or the theory of an intelligent Creator , we assent equally to what is mysterious and incomprehensible . The existence from eternity of an intelligent creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more improbable than , that of an infinite anterior series of any one species of animals . Suppose a species of insects to be the only known living things , we might as probably at least , suppose them to have been formed by an intelligent power at the beginning , as to suppose the series to have been without beginning . Why then should those who affect to be philosophers ; rational , sceptical , and circumspect of belief , and fearful of being too credulous ; choose the harder faith , and believe that not one merely , but myriads , of species , have existed without a beginning . Why should they choose to believe millions of times more than is necessary . These , of all men , can certainly have no right to reproach others with credulity . They gratuitously adopt into their creed millions of mysteries , instead of a single one , which they themselves can not say is more objectionable in itself than any one of the millions , which they profess to believe in , - we say in itself , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and examine the structure of animals and plants , we shall find abundant positive evidence of an intelligent First Cause , as we shall soon notice . But , independently of that evidence , the hypothesis of such a cause , is , it seems to us , incomparably more philosophical . A decisive objection to the arduous faith of the atheist , if made out , is to be met with as early as Lucretius , who asserted // the recent origin of the human race , which he inferred from the rude state of the arts , and the short period embraced by historical memorials and traditions . We do not mention this theory in connexion with our present argument ; but it is plain that if we can go beyond the origin of the human race , or any species of living or vegetating thing , the theory of the infinite anterior series falls to the ground . Now it is remarkable , as mentioned by Mr. Godwin , that the modern discoveries in geology seem to disclose a period when the earth was inhabited by other speQies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confirmed by subsequent discoveries , and though , on the contrary1&gt;races of men and the present races of animals and plants should be discovered in all the anterior periods of which any memorials remain upon or beneath the surface of our globe , still it would afford not the slightest objection to the argument in favor of the existence of a God . But if , on the contrary , we can go back , by means of the memorials of the past state of the globe , to the period when either men , or any of the present races of living things , did not inhabit it , the admission of a creative power , becomes absolutely necessary . As far as geological discoveries have gone , they seem to carry us back to such a period . But whatever may be the results of geological research , the faith of the theist is supported by another , and seemingly a conclusive argument ; not a demonstration , but as strong an argument as can be given that is not such . We allude to the great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution of the world and its inhabitants . It is an argument at least , as old as the poetry of David , who says the heavens show forth the glory of God . And Cicero De Natura Deorum , in a passage quoted by Lord Brougham , says , that " the stable and perpetual courses of the heavenly bodies , with their admirable and wonderful regularity , manifest in themselves a divine energy and intelligence , in so much that the man , who does not see in them the power of the Di. - vlmty , must be truly stupid and insensible . " The mind of a man must have become warped into a strange obliquity and perversity little short of derangement , who can doubt that the feet were intended to walk with , the eye to see with , the ear to hear with , the wings of birds to fly with , the fins of fishes to swim with , and so on throughout the whole of the animal structure and economy ; and if any one does not doubt this , he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // This evidence is not drawn from the depths of science , and addressed merely to the initiated , it is level to the common understanding ; it is full , clear and palpable , and so striking , forcible and apparently conclusive , that it seems to be in vain to reason with a man who professes not to be satisfied with it . We conclude that his scepticism is either nothing more than affectation , or the effect of a perverted and disordered understanding ; and in either case it is in vain to proceed further with him . And here the argument in favor of the first fundamental doctrine of Natural Theology might be dropped ; we were almost ready to say that it is better that it should be , for the attempt to illustrate and fortify this unanswerable argument , very often weakens its force . The belief in a Creator is , as we have suggested , the simplest hypothesis which we can adopt ; it is in itself less improbable than the only other one that can be offered with the slightest plausibility ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , it is the only one which accounts satisfactorily for the phenomenon of the world ; for any hypothesis which excludes design , or which does not include it , does not satisfy the mind ; it does not answer the purpose for which any hypothesis is made in the case . Such are the leading arguments on the first great doctrine of natural religion , namely , the existence of a Creator . The other branch of this science , namely , the attributes of the Deity , and moral obligation and retribution , we shall notice subsequently . We are to bear in mind that Lord Brougham 's plan does not lead him merely to state the argument drawn from the evidences of design , but to show to what species of reasoning it belongs , and to what weight it is entitled . He remarks that writers have confined themselves too much to instances drawn from physical phenomena , to the neglect of the intellectual . Dr. Chalmers , however , urges this latter argument very strenuously , though he considers it less satisfactory than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument from the intellectual phenomena , having premised that he considers mind to be distinct from and independent of matter . This is a higher species of speculation it is true , but we can not but think that Dr. Chalmers is correct in considering this field of illustration less clear and satisfactory than that of sensible objects , since we must know the end proposed in order to appreciate the means . // If , for example , it be granted that men are to be nourished by solid substances , we see very plainly the necessity , or at least , the convenience and adaptation of an apparatus for mastication . But when we come to the mind , the end that may be supposed to be had in view , in the constitution of man , is not so obvious . The subject is wrapped in more obscurity , and therefore the form of the instances drawn thence are less striking and convincing . But still , the mind of man , and the instincts of brutes , certainly afford a wide field for strengthening the evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by considering man as an inhabitant of this world merely , for the reason that we know the condition and relations of men here better than in a future existence , and can therefore , reason from them more clearly . Indeed , in the present stage of the argument , we can not reason from a future existence , which is still to be proved . Denham very judiciously dwells much upon the instincts of brutes , the apparent design and various adaptation of which are easily intelligible and beautifully illustrative of the subject . We find , for instance , men , animals , and plants in particular positions and relations ; if we then go into an examination of their faculties and instincts we shall he struck at every step with the admirable adaptation of each species to its modes of life . The whole science of natural history may be translated into that of Natural Theology by merely laying a greater stress upon the design or final cause at each step . Lord Brougham attempts this mode of illustration by the moral and intellectual phenomena , instancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its effects , and the affections ; and remarks in a note that " not the least allusion is made , in Dr. Paley 's work , to the argument here stated , although it is the foundation of the whole of Natural Theology . Not only does this author leave entirely untouched the argument a priori , as it is called , but also the inductive arguments derived from phenomena of mind , but he does not even advert to the argument upon which the inference of design must of necessity rest ; that design which is the whole subject of his book . Nothing can more evince his distaste for , or incapacity for , metaphysical researches . He assumes the very question which alone sceptics dispute . In combating him they would assert that he begged the whole question , for certainly they do not deny , at least in modern times , the fact of adaptation . " // " Not the least allusion is made in Dr. Paley 's work to the argument here stated , " says Lord Brougham . His expression implies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , if the peculiar essence or substance of the mind is the ground of deduction ; but in respect to the evidence of design , the argument is the same whether mental or physical phenomena be referred to . Take the example of the patella or kneepan given by the author , and that of memory , also given by him , each adduced to prove plan , design , intention . The argument is precisely the same in either case , and the existence of an intelligent creating cause is as distinctly proved by one instance as by the other ; and the best is the one that is most plain and undeniable . If the object or use of a joint , or tendon , or muscle , or tooth , is more obvious , definite and unquestionable than that of the memory , the imagination , or reasoning faculty , then either of the former is the more appropriate and better instance . We do not intend , however , by any means , to say that these illustrations should be neglected . The reasons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral and intellectual faculties of man , as well as from the mechanical structure of animals , and mere physical phenomena , are not that they are more convincing , but that they may be more interesting , and that they belong to a more elevated strain of thinking , and that they may be more striking to some minds . A machinist , for instance , may be more struck with an illustration drawn from the action of a joint , or the structure of the hollow bones of birds , adapted to lightness combined with strength ; while a reader of intellectual pursuits and reflective habits , might see a more palpable evidence of design in the association of ideas . In this view , the author 's suggestion is important , though he does not seem to us to apply it with remarkable skill . He treats the argument of the existence of God a priori , as it is called , with much ability . This argument undertakes to prove , and , in short , to demonstrate the existence of the Deity , independently of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has generally been given up , but Lord Brougham points out its defects with great clearness . Here ends his review of the evidence of the existence of an intelligent creative power . The character and attributes of this power are the subjects of Natural Theology , and the investigation of the evidence of these , would properly come next // under review , but the author does not make this a distinct subject ; he only treats of it incidentally , in subsequent parts of his work . The usual course of argument on this subject , as is well known , is the same as on the existence of God , namely , the illustrations to be found in the actual course of things in this world . We have not noted any reason given by him for omitting so material a part of his subject ; it seems to be a striking deficiency in his work . The great difficulty of treating this branch of the inquiry would , we should suppose , have given it the greater attractions to him . The attribute of power is proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of God . But that he is all-knowing , just and beneficent , needs other illustration . The great difficulty of this argument arises from the existence of evil , and the infliction and the suffer ' . ing of wrongs ; we surmount these by the hypothesis , that all partial ill is universal good , and that the wrongs of the present life are compensated in another . The idea that an omnipotent being is malignant , is too horrid and appalling to be admitted , but upon the strongest evidence . The evidences that the Creator is not so , are sufficiently manifest in the world . The proofs of benevolence entirely preponderate . This includes justice , for we can not conceive of a benevolent being as approving of , or purposely doing injustice . Hence a very strong argument , - much stronger than those instanced by Lord Brougham , - is drawn in favor of future compensation for the evils and wrongs of this life . The argument is deduced from the attributes of the Deity supposed already to be proved . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world demonstrates its governor not to be a malignant being ; but to our imperfect view , it does not so clearly demonstrate his goodness . We see so many evidences of benevolence , that we suppose what seem exceptions , were we to judge from our own imperfect knowledge , are in fact not so . The Epicureans alleged the existence of evil against the doctrine of an intelligent Creator ; considering it a proof of imperfection . There are two arguments on this subject , which are more satisfactory grounds of belief , than our own experience and observation of good and evil , happiness and misery , in this world . In the first place , we can not easily conceive an almighty Being as otherwise than good . There is some seeming incongruity and inconsistency in such a conception . // Secondly , we can not suppose such a being to do wrong . Even allowing him , like the gods of the Epicureans , to be indifferent to the concerns of men , we can not suppose him to be unjust , for this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise be accounted for . Now it would seem to be unjust in the Creator to give his creatures , universally , a deep and all predominant admiration of the beauty and surpassing excellence of benevolence , if it were a vain delusion and mockery , and he himself were without the quality , in short , we can not believe in a God , without also believing in his goodness . After establishing the existence and attributes of the Creator , the obvious succession of topics in this science brings us next to the constitution of man , in which we seek for a knowledge of his relation to the Creator , and the foundation of duty , - the foundation , not the superstructure , for this belongs to the science of ethics , or deontology , - and here we are at liberty to reason , in part , from the character and attributes of the Creator , as already established , for if we have proved that HE is all powerful and just and benevolent , our theory of the constitution , relations , and destiny of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connexion is close , and the consequence necessary , since if it be proved that man must be the creature of the deity , it follows of course that human destiny is subject to his control . The inquiries then are ; first , what such a being as the deity is proved to be , will do ? Second , what is man , as we experience him in ourselves , and observe him in others ? Lord Brougham dwells upon the latter inquiry too distinctly , and does not connect it intimately enough with the former . He sets out with the proposition that the soul or mind is not material . This he considers to be a fundamental proposition . In this Platonic doctrine he departs from the course of reasoning adopted by Locke , Paley , and most of the champions in this science , and he lays so much stress upon this particular dogma , and so interweaves it with the texture of his treatise , that the work itself must stand or fall as it supports or fails in supporting this proposition . For he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not immaterial , the whole science of Natural Theology , as it bears upon the destiny of man , falls to the ground . Have his predecessors in this investigation , then , comniitted an egregious error on this point ? The question is not whether the arguments on the subject go // to the conclusion that man is mere matter , or a compound or combination of matter and some other substance that we call spirit , mind , or soul , but whether the latter doctrine is a fundamental and necessary one in this science . For a man may well believe the soul to be an immaterial substance , and yet not consider the doctrine as essential to the establishment of such a science as Natural Theology . Whether we affirm or deny that man is mere matter , or a composition of this and something else , it is assumed that we know something of matter . Suppose then that we have got over Bishop Berkeley 's doubts and objections , as to the proof of the existence of any such thing as matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there really is , as there seems to he , an external world . What knowledge have we of the matter of xvbich this exterior world consists ? We can only answer from the intelligence given by our senses . Had we but one sense , instead of five , six , or seven , ( for if we consider the feeling of heat and cold , and the power of perceiving resistance , two of them , the number will be seven , ) we should get but little information of this external world ; had we many more than xve have , our knowledge would be much enlarged . The doctrine of the Platonists , of Lord Brougham , and indeed of the far greater part of men , philosophers and others , is that we may , by means of such senses as we have , obtain such a knowledge of the properties and capabilities of matter as to authorize us in the conclusion that it can not think , - that something else must be superinduced to constitute feeling , perceiving , reasoning man . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know little of the nature and essential properties of matter ; we witness its phenomena , or rather a few of its phenomena ; what proportion we know not ; we witness other phenomena of the human mind , of which we have a more full knowledge , since our experience and observation extend to all its properties , powers , and capacities ; we then say that these latter are so diverse from and incompatible with the former , that God himself can not endow matter with the sentient principle . This we say without knowing whether there is but one or are millions of species of matter going to the composition of the globe and its animals and plants ; or whether the phenomena of a tenth or a thousandth of these species strike the senses . What constitutes life ? How are inferior animals endowed // with a capacity for sensation , memory , the passions , &amp;c. ? What line of distinction does Lord Brougham propose to draw between men and other animals , when he maintains that this dogma , as to the substantial composition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so consequently of ethics ? He does not point out the distinction . He does not even allude to it . He has a great example for this oversight . One of the arguments of Plato on the distinct nature and independent existence of the soul is , that there is a difference between the living man and the dead body , something being wanting in the latter which was present in the former . This something he says is the immortal soul This illustration is evidently as applicable to any other animal as man . So Lord Brougham , to prove the immateriality of the soul , and show that the phenomena of mind are not the result of any composition of material ingredients , says - C* We know of no case in which the combination of certain elements produces something different , not only from each simple ingredient , but also different from the whole compound . " Now this argument is as applicable to the instincts of animals as to the mind of man . The oversight of this objection is quite unaccountable , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , habit , dreams , &amp;c. , apply to brutes as well as men , that it seems all but impossible that the objection should not have occurred to him , that he was proving , with respect to brutes , what he was attempting to prove with respect to mankind . It is certain that very few readers will follow him through this part of his speculations , without perceiving the application of his instances to many species of the brute creation . If the argument upon this topic establishes any thing , it establishes so much as to be fatal to it . It is rare to find a more ill-conducted and objectionable piece of reasoning . Lord Brougham mentions a familiar fact , which shows of bow little importance is any theory on this subject of the materiality or immateriality of the mind , in regard to Natural Theology . He says the matter of which the body consists is constantly changing during life , and that it is not probable that a particle of that of the infant remains in that of the man at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal identity . He adduces this fact to show that identity depends // on something else than matter . But it certainly does not prove it to depend on any thing immaterial . We should say that a tree was the same plant from the time of its putting forth a leaflet , to the age of two or three centuries , however many entire changes may have taken place in its particles . This proves that in living things , whether animal or vegetable , our notion of identity does not depend upon that of the constituent particles . If the body may he entirely changed in its constituent parti*. des during life , without destroying personal identity , why should a similar change afterwards destroy it ? What necessarily hinders that the whole substance , whether material or immaterial , of an immortal being , should be changed again and again during its never ending existence , and still the personal identity be preserved ? It is not contradictory to our notions of identity in the instances just given , for the plant is wholly material , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still remains the same plant ; and so in the case of man , the body is taken into the account in our estimate of his identity in this life , and yet he remains the same ; we never doubt his identity , though as an animal he may have wholly changed . What ground have we for confounding identity of substance with identity of personality ? We know nothing of the possibilities within the control of Omnipotence for continuing personal identity through a series of changes , gradual or sudden , of form , and of substance whether material or immaterial . The whole subject is entirely mysterious . It is a fair subject of speculation and of variety of opinions ; but to erect these opinions , whether on one side or the other , and that gratuitously and unnecessarily , into fundamental doctrines , throws a cloud over science and savors of exploded modes of philosophising . Some men suppose they see in matter , properties and incidents inconsistent with its constituting the essence of an immortal being , but if others think a material essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbids . Each opinion is an hypothesis beyond the reach of decisive proof or disproof . It is supposed that the doctrine of materialism tends to that of the utter extinction of being at death . Indeed this is one of the arguments of Lucretius . Admitting this tendency , it does not authorize us to dogmatise on the opposite doctrine of spirituality . However obvious and necessary such a tendency may be , this , at least , would be no reason for assigning // to the doctrine of spiritualism , the position given it by Lord Brougham , and making it fundamental ; if the doctrines of moral obligation and future retribution can be established , as we think they can , without the aid of any inference from the doctrine of spiritualism . We can not reason from what we know nothing of , namely , a spiritual essence , in favor of a future existence . We must first prove a future existence on other grounds . We then say , as a consequence of this doctrine , that man , to survive the present life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference from the essential fundamental doctrines of Natural Theology . To transpose these doctrines and make that of spiritualism the basis and essential condition of the system , is to reverse the order of the argument . It seems to us , therefore , that the most distinguished predecessors of Lord Brou0ham in this inquiry , were logically and philosophically correct in passing over the hypothesis of materialism or spiritualism , as not being essential to this science . There is , as we have intimated , no necessity for resorting to any positive or negative theory as to the composition of the intellectual part of man , to establish the doctrine of a future existence . The existence of an intelligent First Cause , and the attributes of justice and benevolence , being proved , but a single fact more is necessary , and that a very obvious and an indisputable one , to force upon a fair and reasonable mind the belief in a future state of being , in which the moral inequalities of the present shall be compensated and its imperfections remedied . This fact is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding , makes the distinction of right and wrong , and has a sense of moral obligation . Men do not always agree to what is right and what is wrong in particular cases , though they usually agree even here ; but every man makes the distinction of right and wrong , and we do not know that any other animal does make this distinction in an ethical sense . It is one of the deepest , and strongest innate principles in the mental constitution of man . No rational human being , whether civilized or savage , is without it . It follows from the attributes of the Creator already mentioned , and from the analogy of the whole system of the world , as far as it comes under our observation and within our knowledge , that the destiny of men is to be in accordance with this principle of their nature . In other instances among men and inferior animals , the capabilities , wants , instincts , and endowments of each race , are accommodated to // its condition and destiny . If man 's condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonize with , his sense of right and wrong , it is an exception to a rule which holds throughout creation in all other instances , as far as our knowledge goes . Now , if existence terminates with this life , then his condition and fortunes are not in accordance to this strong a ad most noble constitutional principle . A future state of compensations is absolutely requisite to make the harmony and correspondence in this respect , which are manifest in the world in other respects . Leaving , then , all speculations respecting the intellectual substance , or the composition of the soul , we may rest on this basis , in confidence that the universal sense of right and wrong was not given to man to mock his hopes ; and is not an exception to the rule of harmonies and correspondencies prevailing in the whole system of nature besides . A like argument is drawn from the capacity of man for unlimited progression and improvement . We have thus stated concisely what appear to us to be the leading grounds of belief in the fundamental doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numerous ramifications and illustrations into which the argument has been pursued , and by which it is fortified . It is observable that this argument does not necessarily go to the immortality of man , but only to a future state of existence . We do not see that nature merely , independently of revelation , can carry us beyond this result , by decisive reasons , though cogent arguments may he adduced from the same source in favor of our immortality . But we apprehend that it is doing an injury to the cause of Natural Theology and morality , to press the conclusions on this question , drawn from our observations of nature and the constitution of man , beyond their obvious force and application . Even on the admission of atheists , of what no man in his senses can deny , that there is an evident adaptation correspondence , proportion and harmony pervading nature , though they deny the evidence of design , a practical foundation of ethics may be drawn from the moral constitution of man and his capacity for unlimited improvement , since if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correspond to his moral distinctions , and , therefore , when he is acting in conformity to these distinctions , lie is acting upon a natural principle , and for his own well being ; and , when he is acting in contradiction to // them , he is trying in vain to stem the current of nature , and will suffer in his conflict with the order of things established by fate . This is a sufficient ground for a system of ethics upon the mere principles of 1 ) rudence and selfishness . The argument from design , supposes a knowledge of the object to he attained , and , therefore , in one respect comes under the head of reasoning from final causes , a species of philosophising which Lord Bacon considered as not belonging to inductive science . Now , if Lord Bacon had laid down any axiom of philosophising which should make it a vain , fanciful speculation , to suppose the foot intended for walking , the kngs for breathing , and the ear for hearin * , ; for these are the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even so weighty an authority as that of the great teacher of the principles of inductive science , would have not the least influence in supporting such a proposition , in the opinion of any man of common sense . Lord Brougham , however , vindicates him from the discredit of intending to lay down so absurd an axiom ; and shows that he had reference to the abuses and perversions of this mood of reasoning , hy fancying final causes , of which we have no knowledge or evidence . Lord Brou6ham makes some just remarks on the division of inductive reasoning into the analytical and synthetical methods , which he considers to mean substantially composition and resolution , or the putting together , and taking apart ; and he agrees with Dugald Stewart that the division is wholly inapplicable , except to chemical experiments or analogous modes of investigation , and useless , and indeed unintelligible , in relation to moral and metaphysical researches . lie then introduces the subject of " the advantages of the study of natural religion , " which general division , he subdivides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of Natural Theology in particular , and the connexion between natural and revealed religion . The first of these topics , the pleasures of science generally , the delight of discovering new truths , the pleasing surprise of reducing the most remote and apparently disconnected phenomena to the same law ; the gratifying consciousness of the power of the human intellect , and of our own participation in its triumphs ; he illustrates with ability , though with less animation and eloquence than the subject admits and invites . He remarks that in the pursuit of any other science we may contemplate merely the pleasure of the pursuit itself , // without proposing any practical application to our own happiness or misery in any other respect ; whereas , in the study of Natural Theology , we are constantly unfolding truths in which our destiny is involved . This , he adds , " makes it heyond all doubt , the most interesting of all the sciences , and sheds on the other branches of philosophy an interest beyond that which otherwise belongs to them . See , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime inquiries ? Mark where it is that a Newton finally reposes , after piercing the thickest veil that envelopes nature ; grasping and arresting , in their course , the most subtile of her elements and the swiftest , - traversing the regions of boundless space , - exploring works beyond the solar way , - giving out the law which binds the universe in eternal order ! He rests , as by an inevitable necessity , upon the contemplation of the great First Cause , and holds it his highest glory to have made the evidence of his existence , and the dispensations of his power and wisdom , better understood by man . " It has been frequently remarked , and is quite obvious , that a single instance of design in creation is a demonstration of the existence of a God , " But , " Lord Brougham asks , " is it enough to the gratification of the contemplative mind ? The great multiplication of proofs undeniably strengthens our position ; nor can we ever affirm respecting the theories of a science , not of necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently cogent without variety and repetition . But independently altogether of this consideration , the gratification is renewed by each instance of design , which we are led to contemplate . " The concluding section , on the connexion of natural and revealed religion , presents the doctrine that the former is absolutely essential to the latter , in a strong light . The argument is indeed conclusive . The doctrine has been admitted by the most learned and philosophical christians , and questioned mostly by the weak , bigoted and arrogant , who were more inclined to dogmatize and give law , than to convince . Lord Broughani remarks that revelation presupposes the existence of God , and that his attributes must also be presupposed , namely , his power over the laws of nature , and his benevolence , in order to lay a foundation for the application of the evidence on which the christian religion very materially rests . For , if we suppose various beings in the universe , some good and some malignant , // each having , independently of the others , power over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the evidence of miracles , that they were wrought through the power of Beelzebub , would be unanswerable . But , if it be first established by other evidence , that there is but one being who has power over the laws of nature , it follows that the power of suspending those laws can be delegated only by him , and accordingly , that an exercise of such a power is a proof of commission from him . We have already noticed what we consider a fundamental defect in the work , in the rank and l ) osition given to the doctrine of spiritualism . Another instance of very hasty assumption of a theory , though less intimately blended with the texture of the argument , is that on the subject of dreams , which the author suggests may be only the accompaniments of falling asleep and waking up . That dreams may be the phenomena of only partial or imperfect sleep , is a common theory , but that they only occur at the time of going to sleep or of waking up , is , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new or old , it is , we think , inconsistent with phenomena within the observation of every one . Dogs in their sleep certainly show signs of an eager pursuit of the chase in imagination , without immediately waking , and at other times than directly after falling asleep . Somnambulists and persons wl1o talk in their sleep , certainly do not come within tl ) e theory . We have thus given an outline of this work . It certainly shows much ability and considerable reading on the subject . But it is not such a work as the public expected from Lord Brougham , upon such a science . The style is pedestrian , involved and laborious throughout . The author , instead of moving forward with bouyant spirit and ease , seems all the way to be trundling an unwieldy burthen . The work is full of abstraction and toil from beginning to end . The author is a guide in an obscure subterranean region , with a torch in his hand , showing object after object in detail , instead ( l of groups and landscapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning and science in the work , particularly the notes , and too much in the phlegmatic exaggerated style of a catalogue of curious and remarkable things . We would not be understood to exact of an author a vivacity , and brilliancy , luminousnes* and interest , that shall enchain the attention of the idlest reader , on a subject of so logical and scientific a character , // and so learnedly treated , but the reader has a right , we think , to ask to be conducted more among those " pleasures of science , " above spoken of , where he might occasionally feel a spontaneous delight and admiration , without being so often admonished in a frigid manner , to wonder at this and wonder at that . This want of a clear and luminous display of the received evidence of natural religion , as far as its doctrines come under remark , is not compensated hy the suggestion of new views , one of the most striking characteristics of the work , being the want of original thinking . The work certainly can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats . The work of the Rev. Mr. Godwin , on the same subject , the title of which is prefixed to this article , is in striking contrast with the one we have been examining . It appears from the preface , that in the neighhorhood of Bradford , in Yorkshire , in England , where the Rev. Mr. Godwin is an officiating clergyman and an instructer in a seminary , sceptical and atheistical doctrines have become prevalent to a considerable extent , and are openly defended and promulgated with much zeal . With the laudable design of checking the progress of such pernicious opinions , Mr. Godwin undertook a course of public lectures , on the atheistic controversy , which were delivered in his chapel , during the months of February and March , 1834 , and published in England , in the October following . The course consists of six lectures . " The interest felt in the town and neighborhood , was far greater than the lecturer had anticipated . The place was crowded to excess ; the congregation increasing as the course proceeded , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unremitting attention was given to the whole of the lectures , which occupied , on an average , each , about two hours and a quarter in delivery . Those who had embraced the tenets of infidelity , were general and regular in their attendance , and their behavior was marked with propriety . Indeed , " adds Mr. Godwin , " it is but just to say , that in all the communications the author has had with the leaders of the sceptical party , he has been treated with the utmost respect and courtesy. ** These persons promised an answer , and Mr. Godwin supplied them with the sheets of his publication as they came from the press , that they might more early make the intended reply . Whether this has been published , we have not learned . // Mr. Andrews has added , in a short appendix , a train of reasoning on the subject , in aid of the author 's . He remarks of the work in his preface , as , we think , very justly . " The character of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosopher , the scholar , and the man of taste , would desire . It presents the most powerful , logical and convincing train of reasoning , clothed in the most lucid , harmonious and engaging style . As a mere piece of composition , it is beautiful ; as a chain of reasoning , it is overpowering and irresistible . The temper manifested in it too , is highly creditable to the author and grateful to the reader . The most perfect candor , calmness and amiability , prevails throughout it . " A popular work upon this subject , and on this plan , was really needed ; and it could hardly have fallen into better hands . Mr. Godwin commands a bold , free and masterly style , that reminds the reader of Dr. Chalmers , though Mr. Godwin is superior in chasteness , taste and elegance . He is fluent , rapid and fervent . His illustrations are well chosen , and what is a great recommendation of the work , they are not digressions , - they are not so labored , followed out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument in the study of astronomy , anatomy and natural history . The lecturer is constantly going forward , always with spirit , and often with brilliancy and eloquence . In a course of lectures , delivered to such an audience , and under such circumstances , it might be expected that the lecturer would occasionally deviate from the most rigid train of ratiocination , into strong appeals intended for excitement as well as conviction . But on the whole , Mr. Godwin has very well withstood the temptations to address himself to the fears or prejudices of his auditors ; in general , he fairly deals with their understandings . He sometimes adopts an argument that would be better omitted , as for instance , that infinite space must be a property of something , and can be such only of the divinity ; and he sometimes lays too great stress upon a questionable , or at least , a feeble argument , as for instance , the general belief of mankind in a Creator , as evidence of an original revelation of himself .
