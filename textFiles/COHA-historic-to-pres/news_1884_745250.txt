Two strangers rang the bell at Busolfs Hotel , in Hoboken , at 3 o'clock yesterday morning . The porter admitted them , and they went from room to room in so daring a manner that the porter thought they must be robbers and had them arrested . One of them was William H. Humphries , a lawyer of Columbus , Miss. ; the other was John J. Hui : , who said he was a bookkeeper of Twenty-eighth-street and Broadway , New-York , but who is really a private detective . They said that they were hunting for Louis Green , a cotton broker , who is wanted in Mississippi to answer indictments charging him with embezzlement and forgery . He left the South two years ago , after , as Humphries and Hull said , fleecing cotton shippers out of goods valued at $100,000 . It is said that he forged bills of lading for goods by which cotton men in New-York , Fall River , and some other places were large losers . Humphries and Hull said that ever since his flight they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much labor , to New-York- , and Monday evening learned that he was at Busch 's Hotel , Hoboken , which accounted for their descent upon that establishment . The two men were discharged , and later in the morning Green was taken into custody . He admitted that he had misappropiated moneys , belonging to others , but denied the charge of forgery . He professed a willingness to return to Mississippi without waiting for extradition papers , but the lawyer was afraid that he would make trouble in some of the States through which he would have to pass on his way back to the South anti secure his release on habeas corpus . He requested , therefore , that Green be held until the necessary papers for his extradition had been secured . Recorder agreed to hold him till Monday next . He will , however , be detained by an officer at the hotel . When Green was arraigned Humphries was , of course , an interested spectator . A clerk in Busch 's Hotel recognized him as one of the men who had made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer Holm . The officer knew nothing of the previous arrest and discharge of the lawyer , and hurried him back to a cell in spite of all protestations . Recorder , who had meantime left the bench , was called back , and opened court to release the imprisoned lawyer a second time . Green was a cotton broker at Columbus and agent for the White Star Line , a cotton-carrying company engaged - in transporting cotton from Mississippi to the East . It is alleged that by false bills of lading and other manipulations of orders he contrived to swindle manufacturers at Falls River , Mass. , and brokers and merchants of New-York out of various sums of money , atrgregating nearly $100.000 . He fled in April , 1862 . On the eve of his departure , Capt . Humphries , who represented a'number of the creditors , called on Green and managed to obtain $26,000 on account of money due the Ontario Mills of Fall River . Green promised to settle the balance of the claim the next day and started ostensibly for Mobile to collect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarded a steamer for Europe . A few days ago it was learned that he had returned to this country . Ile was traced to a boarding house on Clinton-street , Newark , but before action could be taken to apprehend him he had gone . He was afterward traced to Hoboken , where , as already stated , he was arrested . He has a wife , an attractive and accomplished lady , and a child born just prior to his flight .
