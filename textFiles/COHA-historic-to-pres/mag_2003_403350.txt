FANCY VACATIONS ? FOUR-STAR RESTAURANTS ? PUH-LEEZE , TO STAY HOOKED ON EACH OTHER , LEARN THE SIMPLE TRICK THAT MAKES SPARKS FLY . // Ever notice how some couples just seem to glow when they 're together ? They lean in close , careful not to miss a word . They playfully nudge each other and exchange flirty glances . The buzz between them is almost palpable . " We 're all longing for that chemistry , " says Greg Godek , author of 1001 Ways to Be Romantic . " These couples have that spark , that indefinable something that connects them to each other . " Why are these twosomes able to keep their love energy alive year after year-alongside jobs , kids , and the general crazy-busyness of life ? It 's simple : They find easy ways to keep things exciting . Sure , it 's fun to rent a limo for a big night out or go on a romantic Caribbean cruise now and then . " But your real goal should be to stay connected and bump the relationship up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godek . We 're not talking elaborate escapades here-just little ( but powerful ) tricks to get back that heady , **26;756;TOOLONG feeling . So , ready to kick your couple chemistry up a notch ? Read on and learn how to keep the thrills coming . GET TEMPORARY AMNESIA Last summer my husband , Tony , and I were at a neighborhood barbecue when he launched into a story about one of the contractors who 'd worked on our house-a guy we found passed out in our basement one day , surrounded by empty beer cans . It 's a funny anecdote , but one I 've heard , oh , about a hundred times before , and my first impulse was to politely excuse myself to go search for the potato salad . Instead I stayed and focused on the way Tony was telling the story , imagining I 'd never heard it before . And to my surprise , I was suddenly thinking about his charm , his colorful way with words , his adorable habit of widening his eyes right before the punch line . Plus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot of love adrenaline ; it reminded me of what a wonderful sense of humor he has and why I was so crazy about him to begin with-and still am . The trick to seeing your partner through new eyes ? " Try to tune in to the excitement behind what he 's saying , not just the words , " Godek explains . " After all , things like those favorite old stories are part of who he is and can help you better appreciate him . " DUST OFF YOUR BOWUNG SHOES Whether you 're a former tennis whiz or you led a long-forgotten college punk band , your unique interests are part of what attracted your guy to you . So if your favorite pastimes were edged out by the demands of work and family , now 's the time to reacquaint yourself with them-but not as a couple ; the idea here is to do your own thing . So sign up for a weekly art lesson , buy season tickets to an avantgarde theater company with a group of girlfriends , or even hire a sitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides the obvious enjoyment factor , your " me time " will breathe fresh life into your relationship . Why that 's so : " The best way to bring passion back into your marriage is to bring passion back into your life , " says Michele Weiner-Davis , marriage therapist and author of The Sex-Starved Marriage . " If it 's through a hobby , a new job , friends , working out , or spirituality , you need to reconnect with the things that are uniquely yours . You 'll exude enthusiasm and energy , which will make your guy fascinated by you . " Nita Offineer , 44 , of Amherst , Ohio , has always cultivated her own interests ( e.g. , book clubs , girls ' nights out ) away from her husband . " It makes me feel good about myself , and that positive outlook filters into our marriage , " she says . " The same thing happens when my husband golfs or goes to sporting events . We 've allowed the outside world to invigorate our marriage . " THROW HIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other was new and fascinating . To re-create that " Who is this exciting creature ? " feeling , confess to something naughty . Case in point : When I told my husband that I 'd once dressed up like a guy ( carrying a Playboy magazine , no less ) to sneak into my ex-boyfriend 's college dorm room after hours , his curiosity about me was piqued in a way it had n't been since our dating days . He saw a facet of me that he did n't know existed , and suddenly I , his devoted wife of six years at the time , actually became intriguing to him . Michelle Weinstein , 35 , of Oakdale , Pennsylvania , had a similar experience when she told her husband , Eric , about a grad school prank she 'd played with some friends . " After several pitchers of beer , we broke into our professor 's empty pool house to use his hot tub . It was a crazy , impulsive thing to do , " she says . Her husband 's reaction ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike me to be that wild ; I 'm normally pretty cautious . And it really made him look at me differently-as an unpredictable woman , not just the play-by-the-rules wife and mom he 's used to . " WATCH HIM DO WHAT HE DOES BEST Grab the kids and go see him make that three-point shot at his weekly pickup basketball game , or when he 's in fix-it mode , admire his prowess with power tools . The point is , observing your guy doing his thing-and doing it well , whatever it is-will leave you thinking : He 's good , and he 's mine . Rosemary Buerger , 37 , who recently moved to Germany with her husband , a motor sergeant in the U.S. Army , gets her love-energy fix by eavesdropping when he tucks the kids in at night . " He 's a fantastic father , and it 's so heartwarming to see the sweet way he reads to our girls , " she says . " It makes him more attractive to me because it reminds me why I fell in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cares about . " DAY DREAM TOGETHER Remember when you used to talk for hours about your pie-in-the-sky dreams and deepest desires ? Now your most passionate conversations revolve around parent-teacher conferences and carpooling schedules . Well , it 's time to dream big-as a couple-again . Why ? " It assumes that you two have a future together , and that bonds you , " says Weiner-Davis , who adds that these talks pull you out of your everyday roles as Mommy or Daddy , wage earner or meal maker . " You look at each other with fresh eyes and gain a better , broader perspective of one another as interesting people . " What should you two daydream about ? You name it : exotic vacations , the fantasy house you 'd love to buy , what you 'd do if you won the lottery , what your if-I-could-do-anything jobs would be . One caveat : When you launch into daydreaming mode , do n't utter those three cringe-inducing words , " Honey , let 's talk , " which can often sound critical and uninviting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Godek , who suggests opening your talk in the form of a question . For instance : " Hey , honey . Want to have some fun ? Let 's think about where we could go on vacation . Now , say , in Rome , where would you rather make love : in the hotel or the Coliseum ? " For Denise Mussman , 37 , of St. Louis , a peaceful stroll is what helps her and her husband voice their dreams . " Last weekend we just went out for an hour , got a cappuccino , and walked around while discussing plans to renovate our house ten years from now : master bath , Jacuzzi , expanded kitchen , and so on , " she says . " Talking about our future while we were by ourselves-without the kids interrupting every ten minutes-rekindled our happy feelings of being in love . " MAKE LOVE IN STRANGE PLACES Not to worry-we 're not talking about phone booths or the crosstown bus . But how about sending the kids to a sitter and having sex someplace surprising-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark ? ( Finally , a use for that pup tent ! ) " If you always make love in the same place , it 's easy to get stuck in a mental and physical rut : same stuff , different day , " says i Village.com resident sexologist Patti Britton , Ph.D . " Doing something different can spark your interest in each other ; you both seem more alluring and sex is fun again . " To break out of the routine , simply change the setting and the mood-and do n't be afraid to get a little creative or goofy . ( A candlelit massage in the family room ? A tryst in the walk-in closet ? Lovers ' lane in the driveway ? ) These are the moments that really make things sizzle between you , because you do n't know exactly what your partner is up to-just like in the old days . And hey , just think of the meaningful glances you 'll be able to share later ; you two may never look at the minivan the same way again . DECLARE A SHORTTERM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true . Recently when Tony took a short business trip , I ended up missing him immensely , even though I 'd been looking forward to time alone : to plant flowers , sit in a coffee shop , and get through a whole novel in two nights . When he returned , it was wonderful to rediscover the joy in the sweet little husband-and-wife routines-putting the kids to bed , having dinner together , reading the Sunday paper-that we 'd been taking for granted . We felt genuinely connected as we exchanged meaningful " I 'll meet you later " glances over the kids " bedtime books . We were completely tuned in to each other after our time apart . To build time-outs into your marriage , look for opportunities to be apart for a bit : a visit to a relative , an overnight at a girlfriend 's house , a Girl Scouts camping trip with the kids . Just a day apart can stir up those feelings of longing . TURN BACK TIME-WITH A PEN Another way to recapture the intense emotions that first drew you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marchionni , 35 , of Havertown , Pennsylvania , recently wrote in a journal about her first date with her husband , 11 years ago . " I did it in the present tense , which made it feel more real and brought all those memories back up to the surface , " she says . " I remembered the tie-dyed-shorts outfit I had on , the sound of his voice , the way he looked at me , and the butterflies in my stomach . " Although the journal was a onetime thing , Mary Jo rereads it anytime she wants to get a crush on her husband again . " It reminds me of how great he is , why I was so attracted to him in the first place , and why I ca n't wait to see him now when he comes home . And it 's useful if he 's getting on my nerves ; it makes me remember that in the grand scheme of things , his good qualities are more important than the fact that he left a dirty cup on the counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a total city girl ? Suggest a camping weekend . Are you a book-worm ? Hit a karaoke bar ; he 'll be amazed at your nerve . Even something as simple as a getting up an hour earlier to have breakfast with your mate ( if you 're typically a night owl ) can be a welcome change of pace , says Godek . " There 's a danger in familiarity , " he says . " Changing any patterns and doing things unexpectedly is a great way to keep love alive . It works because surprise itself is invigorating ; it makes the relationship go " Zing ! ' ' " READ TO EACH OTHER There 's something so bonding , even sexy , about getting engrossed in a story together-or just hearing your guy read lines from Shakespeare , a scary mystery , or the latest best-seller . His voice , after all , is undoubtedly a big part of your history , as in those long phone conversations from your dating days and his first declaration of passion . Hearing him read aloud can make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband 's voice is such an intimate experience , " says Liz Boone , 33 , of Leetsdale , Pennsylvania , who often takes turns reading aloud with her husband , Rob , before bedtime . " We 're so busy with jobs , our house , and our sons that reading is a quick way to connect . Plus , I often want to talk more than he does , and books like the Chicken Soup series can be great discussion starters . " KNOW THE CODE Go ahead-be the only two people in the world in on a secret . By sharing code words or signals , you 'll crank up your chemistry level . Some couples have a set of special insider expressions and gestures that they use to stay connected when they 're in public : a sideways glance , a barely perceptible smile , a finger rubbed against a cheek . For Jennifer Vecere , 33 , of Beaver Falls , Pennsylvania , using obscure nicknames helps reclaim that just-between-us feeling . " I call him BD , which stands for Big Dog . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masculine and sweet , like a Saint Bernard , " she says . " And he calls me Lida , from The Music Man , my favorite musical . When he calls me Lida-so that I 'm the only one who can hear him-I just glow , especially if we 're around a lot of other people . " PURSUE INSTANT GRATIFICATION Adopt a right-here , right-now mindset-at least occasionally . No , the two of you ca n't ( necessarily ) just decide to skip out of work early and drive to Mexico in a red convertible . But there are other ways that you can work a little spontaneity into your union . For instance , if you 're thinking of your guy , call him now . Appreciate him ? Hug him this instant . Want to make love ? Track him down and do it as soon as humanly possible-or at least let him know the steamy thoughts that are running through your head . " The inherent message is that your spouse is top priority , " says Godek . " It 's a " Screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CELEBRATE EACH OTHER Showing your pride in him will give him that strong , confident , " I 'm the man " feeling , and it 'll remind him how lucky he is to have his number-one fan by his side . ( It 'll also make him more likely to look for ways to show his love and admiration for you , too . ) You do n't have to rent a billboard to make a statement ; you can celebrate , say , by sending him a card when he aces a big work project . Or when he finally meets his goal of running a 1OK race , call up friends and relatives ( while he 's within earshot ) to brag about him . When Jennifer Vecere 's husband , Erik , landed a great new job , she sent a bird-of-paradise flower-his favorite-to his office , along with a note that said , " Look in your trunk . " When he did , he found a basket filled with gourmet treats and new office supplies , along with a soothing Japanese fountain for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so touched and pleased , " says Jennifer . " He realized how proud I was of him ; he felt as if he could conquer anything , and that really sparked a connection between us . " Shortly afterward , Erik reciprocated by surprising her with ballroom-dancing lessons . " We all have hills and valleys in our marriages , " she says . " Congratulating each other on the good things really sends you speeding up those hills . " Sidebar 15 THINGS TO SAY THAT 'LL MAKE ANY GUY GLOW Never underestimate the power of a little flattery to get your guy 's heart racing , says marriage therapist Rebecca Fuller Ward , author of How to Stay Married Without Going Crazy . " Look , everyone loves hearing compliments , " she says . " They like to be told they look good , and they especially enjoy knowing that their partner finds them sexually satisfying . " A few kudos to get you started : * " You 're my hero . " * " No one carves a pumpkin/plays Santa/hides Easter eggs the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ger home from work to see you . " * That was hysterical ! You are so funny . " * " I 'd give up chocolate for you . " * " I want to show you off . " * " Hey , check out those abs ! Have you been working out ? " * " Vin Diesel has nothing on you . " * " You 're the best lover in the world-ever. " * " I 'm so proud of you . " * " I love watching you work . " * " Our kids are so lucky to have you for a dad . " * " Wow , you look really hot in those jeans . " * " I love it when you . " * " I ca n't ever imagine being married to anyoune else . " // <p>
