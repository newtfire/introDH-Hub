They were employed in the shoe shop on the third floor of the building . Both of them have been bearing a ball and chain . but they managed to file these off , and at 9:30 o'clock this morning , when a-switch engine which had been at work inside the walls started to pull out through the north gate , the two men suddenly broke from their benches , knives and hammers in hand , and ran down stairs past the second floor to the ground , reaching there just as the engine came along . The fireman was alone in the cab . Whiting jumped on and seizing the fireman by the throat , threw him to one side , while ho pulled the throttle wide open . Havens had crowded into the cab in the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine was within 10 feet , of the gate and running at a rapid rate of speed , a guard stationed on the wall - shot Whiting through the heart , killing him instantly . Havens clung to the engine until well outside , when lie jumped and started for a cornfield with a guard close upon him . His ankle had been sprained in jumping , and , finding himself unable to get away , he turned fiercely upon the guard and was shot in the head , the bullet glancing around his skull and only slightly stunning him . He was locked up . The engine was caught by a yardman and stopped . Whiting and Havens , although both under 25 years of age , were the most desperate characters in the penitentiary.
