A recent study of companies that repurchased their own shares during the 1980s produced some eye-opening findings that may point the way to big profits . Professionals have long debated whether stock buybacks trigger meaningful gains , and if they do , whether those gains are just blips that dissipate after a few months . Now business professor David Ikenberry at Rice University in Houston and his colleagues Josef Lakonishok at the University of Illinois and Theo Vermaelen at Insead , a business school in France , have come up with compelling evidence to settle the question . Their study of 1,239 companies that announced stock buybacks in the past decade showed that the boost such buybacks give to a firm 's share price is much bigger and longer lasting than many experts previously believed . After three years , the buyback companies beat portfolios of comparable stocks by 12.6% on average . And value stocks frequently scored a lot higher . " For companies whose shares start with a low market price relative to their book value , buybacks can add 45% over four years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timely now . Not since 1987 have there been so many opportunities to invest in companies that are repurchasing their shares . " We 're going through a buyback craze , " Ikenberry says . " So far this year , stock repurchases have totaled more than $25 billion . " Why do stock buybacks frequently help share prices ? There are two important reasons , according to Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany in Albany , N.Y. : * Buybacks often show that top executives think their company 's stock is too cheap . Share repurchases usually mean that a company can get a higher return on its own businesses than it could by investing cash elsewhere . Of course , the insiders could be overly optimistic . But on balance , they 're right more often than not . * Stock repurchases can boost a company 's earnings per share . When a firm reduces the number of outstanding shares , that usually translates into higher earnings per share ( assuming that the company earns more on its equity than it could by investing extra cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ) . Buybacks also tend to increase book value per share , another measure that many investors rely on . Further , if the stock has a high current yield , money saved on dividends helps to pay for the buyback . MONEY talked with a dozen value-oriented money managers to find companies buying back their stock that also appear to be undervalued . As long as the companies follow through on their announced buyback programs , the pros project that all five stocks could return 20% or more to shareholders over the next 18 months . Ametek ( ticker symbol : AE ; recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange at $15.75 a share with a 1.5% yield ) . A high-tech manufacturer with annual sales of $785 million , Ametek began a complex balance sheet restructuring this past spring . The company slashed its dividend 65% to 6c a quarter and borrowed $275 million at an average rate of 8.7% . Along with Ametek 's cash on hand , that money was used to retire $188 million of 9.2% debt and begin an 8.7-million share-repurchase program that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . " In percentage terms , it 's one of the largest buybacks I 've ever seen , " says Bill Staton , publisher of the newsletter Bill Staton 's Money Advisory ( $99 ; 800-216-1818 ) . Profits have been solid at the company 's electro-mechanical group , which makes small electric motors for everything from vacuum cleaners to computers and medical equipment , and at the industrial-materials division , which produces space-age plastics and metals . By contrast , the precision-instruments business , which manufactures aircraft cockpit gauges , among other things , and accounts for roughly a third of sales , has suffered because of the weak aerospace market . Analysts note , however , that cost cutting has improved profitability at that division . Overall , they say that earnings could improve sharply as Ametek 's shares outstanding shrink and business picks up , as expected . " The company has bought about half the shares it 's planning to , and the stock has gone from $11 to nearly $16 , " says Staton . " By the time they finish , the share price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 46% gain from here over the next 18 months . Loews Corp . ( LTR ; NYSE , $89 ; 1.1% ) . " With its shares trading below book value , Loews is buying back stock like crazy , " says Donald Yacktman , president of Yacktman Asset Management in Chicago . The $13.8 billion company , which is 26% owned by the . Tisch family , is chiefly in insurance but also has a tobacco business ( Newport cigarettes ) , a 23% stake in CBS , and other interests from oil drilling to watchmaking ( Bulova ) . As chairman Laurence A. Tisch 's stewardship of CBS makes clear , he may not be a broadcasting visionary , but he does know how to wring money out of a balance sheet . " The Tisches are some of the savviest financiers in the country , " says Yacktman . " If you add up all the pieces of Loews , you get a total value that 's double the current stock price . " Shares outstanding have been reduced 19% since 1989 to 60.5 million . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock could top its 1992 high of $126 within the next 18 months . That would mean a 42% profit for shareholders . Oshkosh B'Gosh ( GOSHA ; traded over the counter at $15 ; 2.7% ) . After trading as high as $42 in 1991 , Oshkosh tanked when earnings practically disappeared earlier this year . As a result , the stock is now barely trading above book value . The problem : The family-controlled firm ( $335 million in revenues ) , which makes and sells children 's clothing and adults ' casual clothes , has been too slow to react in a highly competitive apparel market , says David Katz at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York City . Still , he says , " The company has strong cash flow , no debt and a dominant franchise . " In July , Oshkosh announced a 1.5-million-share buyback , or just over 10% of the stock outstanding , and has already bought 650,000 shares . " Management is being more aggressive about trimming costs , so now a rebound is just a matter of time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 33% to top $20 over the next 18 months . Ralston Purina Group ( RAL ; NYSE , $36.75 ; 3.3% ) . Over the past 12 years , Ralston has been a steady buyer of its own stock . And for a long time , that strategy helped the share price : It grew eightfold to $60 between 1982 and 1991 . Since then , however , earnings have eroded more than 10% , and the stock has ratcheted down . To get the price back up , Ralston began a major restructuring last year . In July 1993 , the company distributed stock representing 55% of its $2 billion Continental Baking Group to shareholders . And this Maich , Ralston similarly spun off its $933 million consumer-foods division , which includes baby food , cereal and crackers . Those spin-offs have been worth nearly $13 for Ralston shareholders who have held on to the stock . The remaining firm , with sales of $5.2 billion , consists principally of Ralston pet food and animal feed and Eveready batteries . " It 's a good combination , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used to feed the growth of the battery business . " He expects that the company will continue to be a steady buyer of its stock and that the share price could gain 31% to $48 over the next 18 months . FPL Group ( FPL ; NYSE , $31.75 ; 5.3% ) . In May the holding company for Florida Power &; Light , one of the largest electric utilities with annual sales of $5.2 billion , stunned investors with a bold restructuring plan . FPL announced it would cut its dividend by nearly a third to 42 a quarter and use the money saved to buy back stock . Whatever the plan 's merits , shareholders did n't like seeing their dividend cut , and the shares promptly plunged more than 20% to below $28 . Since then the buyback seems to be appealing to more investors , who realize that it will boost the company 's growth in earnings per share and thus ultimately pay off in higher dividends . " They 've said they 're going to buy back 10 million shares by 1996 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised if they increase the number . " As a result , he thinks the stock could move up to $36 . Including the dividend , that would mean an 18.3% total return over the next 18 months . <p>
