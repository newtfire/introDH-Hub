Senator James C. Couzens , progressive ex-Mayor of Detroit and suc- cessor to Mr. Newberry , declared in a public memorandum that demagogues throughout the country are magnifying the difficulties under which railways are operating . The public is being offered the choice of wage reductions for railway men or increased railway tariffs . Reduction of wages is an obvious saving for railway executives to suggest . " Why , " suggested the Senator , " do n't they do a little brain work to produce the necessary saving by increased railroad efficiency ? " <P> In support of his contention that the railways can economize by efficient operation , Mr. Couzens offers statistics obtained from the Interstate Commerce Commission : The net ton miles per 1,000 pounds of tractive power in 1920 was exactly the same as in 1903 . On the 10 most efficient roads freight locomotives average 77.2 miles of travel a day , but on the 39 largest roads the average is only 63.4 miles . Coal consumption on the most efficient roads is 160 pounds per 1,000 gross ton miles , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of economics which Senator Couzens estimates at upwards of $465,000,000 if carried out . The railways have not yet replied as to the practical possibility of putting the suggestions into effect .
