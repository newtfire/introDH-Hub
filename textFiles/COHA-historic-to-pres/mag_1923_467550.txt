THE title of this essay was selected not without hesitation . Its writer exposes himself to attack on several lines . The pitiless public ( it is its business to he pitiless ) may say with varied emphasis : " Stuff and nonsense . There is no art in courtship . " Or : " How horrid to apply art to this sweet ? est , noblest , purest , etc. , emotion ! " Or , more rudely : " A lot you know about it , to lecture us who do know ! " Or , more wary : " I sha n't try it . " Yes , much may be said against this essay , but let us venture all the same . Let us be clear that generalizations on courtship do not apply to everybody . They do not apply to super-emotional people , to artists , whether in paint or passion , or to the unduly intellectual . Such monsters must look after them ? selves in the lists of love . We need not concern ourselves with the Romeos and Juliets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire spots . When in love , a normal man or woman should have an excellent appetite ; love needs sustaining . Besides , the original Romeo and Juliet were crude and blundering persons who would never have successfully fallen in love if they had not both been crude and blundering . Persons of that sort could fall in love with anything . The people who matter are the ordinary people , like ourselves , who are capable of falling in love , but arc also capable of contemplating the beloved object with an eye that retains some lucidity , capable , too , of falling out of love . Also , it will not do to be didactic . There is no patent elixir to pour into lady 's coffee or the lady 's car ; one should recognize that different people require to be approached in different ways ; that experiment must combine with experience ; that some cases are hopeless ; that some lovers are still more hopeless . One must do what one can , and for that reason , the reader 's forbearance is requested , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience can not apply to all men . In the first place , he should not be shocked by the suggestion that court ? ship is an art . It may sound insincere , in view of the romantic idea of the lover as one who ravels his hair , of the idea of the beloved as one who turns away and says : " It 's so sudden . " Those ideas are obstinate , and reliance does not yet accept that the modern proposal is no longer conducted on the knees , but more likely summed up in the question , " What about it ? " This , how ? ever , does not mean that the fatal , " What about it ? " is not best brought about , best from the point of view of success , if certain methods are adopted . In other words , success to-day is no more likely than success a century ago , unless one applies to courtship a certain degree of low cunning . You see , I am a horrid man , because I wo n't pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few thousand years is free from deceit . It is an elaborate piece of play-acting , generally so unconscious that the actors are de ? ceived . Consider any young couple ; mark the man 's tie ? not his everyday tie ; mark the reply : " Yes , darling " . . . and question his sisters ; consider the mildness of his anger when in the presence of the beloved , and ascertain his vocabulary when he misses a train . Likewise , consider the girl ; contrast her costume when keeping an engage ? ment with the one she reserves for the Sunday school ; listen to her : " How true that is , Jack ! " and compare it with her vision of Papa 's mind , as imparted to her sisters ; consider her vivacity ( if he likes a joke ) , her beauti ? ful , still silences ( if he is moody ) . They are acting , both of them , and they are not to blame . If we saw people absolutely as they are our allegiance might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not insincere ; their acting is legitimate because they are entitled to charm . Also : all art is conscious . Now and then you meet a temperamental giant , like Samuel Butler , or Rubens , who breaks the rules and is great , but , in general , art demands a great deal of conscious technic . Love too has its technic , and any woman of experience ( providing she has not at ? tained the age when a freshman can charm ) will confess that the skilled prod ? uct of the professional lover pleases her better than blundering emotion , however sincere . As a preliminary to courtship , it is of course important to decide what one wants to obtain from another person . Without decision ; there is no direction ; for instance , many women have set up companionships with men , thinking they need their friendship , when they seek their love , or vice versa . One can obtain from one creature love , friendship , af ? fection , gratitude , or respect , but one will hardly earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants . A preliminary to courtship is the investigation of the temperament of the beloved object . Many innocent people think that this does not matter , and that courtship itself will enable them to understand the beloved . That is doubtful ; the beloved wo n't allow it , if he or she is wise . The object should be seen in his or her own family , if possible tired , or receiving income-tax papers , or in some such revealing situation . Also , there are the friends of the beloved ; their evidence can be averaged , for some will tell you the worst , and a few the best . If we assume that the beloved object has been selected , it appears that court ? ship divides itself into two stages . One we may call the approach , which establishes a preliminary relation between a man and woman . That is the organic matter in which later the germ may be placed , and love develop . The second stage consists in the development of the germ until it produces , perhaps marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , everybody must in the end love somebody , but it is worth consider ? ing how to use both these stages in such a manner as to induce our germ , which we may call the cupidococcus , to become as large and as beautiful as may be . The first point in the approach is this : love is not enough . Love is a very good thing ; it is a pearl , but a pearl needs an oyster to hold it . It is not enough to love as the jellyfish between the waters . The complex human being 's first task is to implant in the mind of the beloved the idea that he or she might be accepted as a lover . This must be stressed , for many emotions go astray merely because the person at whom they are directed does not perceive them . The good seed falls on stony places and is devoured of the fowls of the air . The art of courtship consists in giving to these stony places a light dressing of good earth , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes love to a woman it is necessary that she should have imagined you as a possible lover . If we consider that any attractive young woman is on speaking terms with something between a dozen and a hundred men , it is obvious ( unless she is a little unusual ) that she can not have pictured herself in amative rela ? tions with all of them . The one who loves her , therefore , must by some means cause her mind to take in the idea that she might accept him as a lover ; he must detach himself from the others ; be must advertise . A good instance of this is the old story where a matchmaker , confronted with cold Arabella and frigid James , told Arabella that James adored her , and informed James that Arabella dreamed only of him . This provided the necessary approach : each one was then able to imagine the other as a lover , and the rest could be left to them . That difficulty is particularly strong between playfellows . People who have known each other since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad-tempered and dirty , fail to realize the change . Knowing each other very well , they find it difficult to love each other . The same applies to people who are supposed to be too old , too low in financial or social status . The be ? loved meets them frequently , but it does not occur to her that she might love the grown-up man who was " Dickic ? with-the-dirty-nose , " or this man of forty who told her stories when she was a little girl , or this minor clerk in her father 's big business . That is where the art of courtship operates . Much of it is instinctively known to lovers , but not all . Among the methods that are known we may place the fascination of the beloved by one 's wit , by one 's strength , one 's courage , one 's elegance . Those are not worth discussing , for the lover naturally shows all that is best in him ; but he neglects valuable weapons , viz ! that which is worst in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar exhibition of rakishness and evil-living , even though this have a limited appeal to women , particularly when they are good . I mean rather that lovers tend to ignore the value of weakness . The art of courtship would tell us not to lose emotional opportunities to exhibit des ? pondency , uncertainty of will , fear of the future , perhaps even tears : in one recorded case the tears of one lover proved stronger than the vigor of another . The same applies to poverty . Intelligently used , poverty can be as effective as wealth , providing it is properly advertised . This does not mean that one should brag of one 's poverty , as the vulgar do of their wealth . It means that the lover who is poor butwise will let his beloved see how his poverty bars him off from his dream . Or again , if a man be lonely , the art of courtship will tell him not to keep a stiff upper lip , but to let his beloved feel that she is the one ship on a hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lover . Or is it oddity , which leads to unpopularity ? Let not the lover be afraid . To begin with , the fact that he talks at all of his unpopularity convinces his beloved that she , who tolerates the things that make him unpopular , must be more discerning than other people : self-satisfaction encourages love . Or there is shyness . Women seldom think men stupid because they are shy . They are rather sorry for them , and sometimes believe themselves the cause of that shyness , which again is flattering . Or perhaps the lover has unrecognized talent , encounters adversity in business , or the arts . Admirable weapon ! The value of unrecognized talent is that it is so difficult to recognize : failure may draw from the eyes of beauty tears that would not be given to success . One can sum up by suggesting : " Do not stress your good looks , your wealth or your wit , but stress rather your pov ? erty , weakness , sickness , miseries . " Briefly , the lover who wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to him , should trade on her maternal in ? stinct . This may sound unfair , but love is a game where all things are said to be fair . The lover who practises this por ? tion of the art of courtship is making use of one or two female tendencies . Leav ? ing aside her natural impulse toward suc ? cess and vigor , he is using her contrary impulse to side with the weak , to protect the sick , and to soothe the wretched . You may say this is nonsense , and that if a woman can secure a lover six foot tall , with a big voice and a big banking account , she will not look elsewhere . That is not always true : the long-haired poet in consumption may overcome the young giant . Another important point , ill-recog ? nized by lovers , is that most women are highly responsive to the attraction of the arts , of letters , of music . They do not understand them much better than men , but they like them better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all re ? spond . Here the art of courtship bids the lover be cautions : culture is not a thing that can be bought ready-to-wear ; the beloved will soon had him out if he learns only tags from Browning , or to hum the third movement of the Kreutzer Sonata . What he needs to do is to in ? crease the tolerance with which the aver ? age crude man seems to view the arts . If he has no wings , then let him not clip hers ; let him sympathize without pat ? ronage , reserving for future matrimony the masculine privileges of crudity and ignorance . It accords with the temperament of the average crude man that the art of courtship should also recommend impu ? dence . You will observe that the same art has already recommended shyness , but different solutions fit different prob ? lems . Shyness is often artificially as ? sumed : a woman of experience who is told by a man that he is shy and does n't get on with women , will in him suspect profound motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as heavily if he has enough tact to discover his moment , enough common sense to discover how much the beloved will stand . . . and then slightly to exceed her limit . In my notebook stands the case of a young man who , at an evening party , ventured to kiss an attractive girl after half an hour 's acquaintance . She was furious . The impudent youth protested her beauty , the irresistible temptation , etc. , and flat ? tered her into such content that , spon ? taneously , she said : " All right , I 'll for ? give you . " The impudent youth replied : " I do n't want to be forgiven , I want to be understood . " During the mental dis ? array created in the lady 's mind by a reply so audacious , he was able to renew his offense . The last suggestion of the art of court ? ship , during this preliminary period of approach , when all that is desired is thatthe beloved should conceive the idea of a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of talking of love . The artis ? tic lover need not be crude : only in the later stage should he become personal . At this time nothing should be done to suggest that the lover is attracted ; to do that . would he most imprudent . But love , being a large subject , can be discussed from the emotional , the mystical , the sportive , the biological point of view . And it does not matter from what point of view love is talked of , providing it is talked of enough . Such conversation produces a favorable atmosphere ; it leads to anecdotes , confidences , and an ? ticipations ; a desire arises to know some ? thing of these emotions , to know them soon , to know them with . . well , why not ? Briefly , the atmosphere is created . The lover has attained a point where his approach will no longer surprise , or , if it surprises , it will do so only as a revela ? tion not devoid of attractiveness . That being gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is his business to con ? vert a companionship already tender into a relation more precise . It now lies with him to effect conquest by courtship . Assuming that the lover is reasonably young , not too ill-looking , not too poor , it may almost be said that any man can wed any woman if he knows how to read her emotional index , how to discover the moment when she will listen to him . She may later be sorry that she has done so , but she has listened . But one can not seize the moment as a rabbit suddenly by the ears : the beloved must have been courted . Companionship , however ten ? der , is not love . Love , let us repeat it , is not enough . Skill is required to convert companionship into true love . It . is easy enough for a man to marry a woman by offering her marriage , its novelty and its excitements , by holding up a home , money , freedom ; that is easy enough , and most couples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture a woman 's whole heart , though it is worth while . A woman 's heart is waste land for the sowing ; it depends upon the sower what crops arise , and whether they bear ten ? fold or a hundredfold . The principal object in courtship is to strengthen the vanity of the beloved ob ? ject . This , as a rule , is easy , and one might often think that the vanity which exists needs no strengthening : that is deceptive . You see a woman perfectly gowned , wayward , bragging of her eyes or her knowledge of Sanskrit ; she seems very pleased with herself , but she may possibly think herself a poor little thing among Olympians ; the smaller she feels , the more she boasts . Not long ago , there was current in England a vaudeville song " You must sprinkle me with kisses if you want my love to grow . " Why not : " You must sprinkle her with flattery , admire all her good points , and especially her bad ones ? " For " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hands which are her only defect one can say that they are " intelligent . " Indeed , her good points may be let alone ; she knows all about those , and less skilled lovers have informed her . It is her mediocre points she wants to have appreciated , partly because this reassures her , partly because it convinces her of the originality of the lover 's taste . The tatter matters not much : what matters is the reassurance , the certainty created by the lover that she is good-looking , that she is clever , because the good opinion of herself which the lover creates produces a malleable mood . She feels great : she can afford to condescend . She feels grateful : why not condescend to him ? Also , he alone sees these excellences : would it not he wise to turn to him who sees them where others may not ? Flattery is more than gifts , for it produces self-esteem , and self-esteem spreads toward its creator as the leaf turns toward the sun . Of course the flattery should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman accept the remark : " You are perfectly beautiful , " than to offer her a delicate compliment . The brutal com ? pliment is a splendid weapon , but it re ? quires an education of the voice , an elo ? quence of the glance , a dramatic mixture of audacity and confusion , which sug ? gests that he who pays the compliment is carried away . It had best be let alone . Indirect flattery is more effective in the hands of the inexperienced , and it should be dosed with a little blame , laughing , tolerant blame , so that it may " ring true , " just as a silver coin is hardened with a little copper . Of course , the com ? pliment should be sincere . . but there is no harm in a little more being per ? ceived than is intended . The truth can be put cleverly and seem more true . One serious error awaits all lovers , and even married lovers : triumphing over past or present rivals . His present rivals the lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless he is skilled enough to praise them as they should not be praised , but this too he had better let alone . In general , it is also unadvisable to refer to past rivals , even to dead ones . Dead rivals are some ? times dangerous , because they have be ? come ideals . If one could raise them from the dead , they would be easier to manage .. The main reason , however , for not running down a rival , even if he be drunken or faithless , is not so much that one enlists on the side of him one attacks the natural sympathy of the beloved for the underdog ; the main reason is that to depreciate a previous lover reflects on her good taste . After all , she once did distinguish him . Thus , one may always sympathize with her misfortunes , but never blame him who brought them about . Moreover , it is difficult to attack a rival unless one boasts of one 's own ex ? cellences , and boasting needs some man ? agement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . He must not exaggerate this , but he must at least feign a good opinion of himself , which will be accepted by a woman favorably inclined to him ; this will enhance in her mind the romantic value of her lover , the greatness of her prize . Probably , the best form of boasting consists in mock-modesty , because anything a human be ing says to another excites contradiction ; contradiction is our way of asserting our personality . Thus , the mock-modest lover will generally cause the beloved to argue on his side . To do this she must discover substantial arguments . Where can she find them save in the excellences of the lover ? So she must discover those excellences , and if he attracts her , she will . In the same order of ideas as boast ? ing lies , of course , the tactful and delicate exhibition of the lover 's social , political , financial , or artistic power . This needs care . It is wrong to say : " The boss wanted to see me , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . " This is shocking . Better say : " The boss wanted to see me . But I had an appointment with you . " Greatness . . . and slavery to a woman : what a tribute ! The status of a lover should be shown indirectly , and should not be concealed , let the ro ? mantic novelist praise as he likes the silent , modest man . The silent , modest man never cut any ice if anybody else happened to rush in with an ax . It is important that the beloved should rec ? ognize the status of the lover , so as to give her a pleasant dream of her future by the side of one so important . The lover should also avoid habits . We all fall into habits ; they enable one to get more into one 's life , but they seldom allow one to get as much out . The tend ? ency of a lover is to visit his beloved soon after business hours , to administer a preliminary kiss , and to offer some amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice for a month ; then , dull . If he behaves like that , the be ? loved will first come to expect attend ? ance and attention which it may some ? times be inconvenient to give ; if she is disappointed , she will be annoyed . If she is not disappointed , she will become bored . The lover should recognize that most women lead dull lives , and that he must provide the delightful unexpected . His visits should be irregular ; if he ar ? rives suddenly , she is charmed ; if he does not come when expected , she misses him a little . If he varies his suggestions , he ceases to be " Dick-who-takes-me-to ? the-theater , " and becomes " Dick-who ? always - proposes - something - amusing . " There is , it is true , an advanced course for lovers , where habits are intentionally formed , so that from time to time they may be broken , the object being to give pain . A lover may find it politic to in ? flict pain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reali ? zation of the lover 's value . This should not be done too early in the courtship , nor done too often , nor done at all except by the clear-headed . A similar point arises on jealousy . For thousands of years the poets have told us to arouse the jealousy of the charmer ; there is sense to this , though we must to-day deal with a type of woman more intelligent and clean-minded than the beautiful , selfish , revengeful , animal idiots represented by Shakespeare , Ten ? nyson , Homer , Dante , etc . Women did not have a psychology until the seven ? teenth century . They were just animals . So it was easy to arouse the feelings of jealousy . To-day , we must count with a prouder generation , with women who are less overcome when distinguished by a man . They love best in a state of safety , and often a creature ceases to love when it ceases to believe that it is loved . In courtship romanticism:is best ; the awakening of jealousy should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tional iceberg . Of gifts , which are essential in court ? ship , I would say only two things , the second being very English . One is that they should be varied , just as pleasures should be varied . Two pounds of choco ? late every Tuesday afternoon punctu ? ally is very nice , but it cloys . Occasion ? ally substitute peppermints . The second and English suggestion is : do n't over ? do it . Excessive gifts create an un ? fortunate precedent in the married state ; also , fulfillment feeds desire in these things , and he who begins in silver may end in platinum . Lastly , frequent gifts blunt surprise ; gifts are made rare mainly by their rarity . A difficult point , which must , be con ? sidered , is the exchange of confidences . Most lovers feel a horrid impulse to re ? veal to each other everything they have ever done or heard . This does not al ? ways matter , for the other party does not listen very carefully , and sits gasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to replace his dull confidences by her exciting ones . Still , one often says too much . Confidences are essential , but they should be calculated . The lover must have a past , provided that it is past . He must have a past , because women tend to think that a man without a past can have no future . A woman had better have only a present . That being said , in general , it seems that the lover would do well to reveal a few trifles , not too recent , which can compare with the great love that holds him now . The beloved then feels that she is different , and we all want to be different . Also ( all these remarks are based on truth , magnified , but still truth ) it does no harm to reveal a past great love , pro ? vided it is old enough . The advantage is that , while people believe that one can not love truly twice , they generally believe that one can love them all the same ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loving . However , something should be held back , fairly openly ; this increases inse ? curity and fans desire . A woman should feel safe of her lover , practically safe , but there is a certain spice in knowing that there is a hundredth chance . The tendency of many men is to keep their work out of their courtship . They say : " Oh , my darling , I would not spoil your beautiful pure mind with the grimy cares , etc . " Do n't be nervous . Women are n't so lilylike as all that . . . and , if they are attracted , your cares cease to be grimy . They become romantic . The woman who falls in love with a motor ? car builder will be as interested in motor cars as she would have been in law cases if she had favored an attorney . Indeed , a woman generally loves a man 's work until it interferes with his affections . This does not mean that she must be lectured , but she must be satisfied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work . If he is hers , his work is hers . Indeed , a lover will do no harm by occasionally sacrificing his be ? loved to his work . In my notebook stands the case of a lover who went away to keep a business appointment . His beloved said : " I hate you for going , and I should have hated you if you had broken a business engagement on my account . " You see , this art of courtship needs some management . It even de ? mands that the lover should ask his be ? loved to do him small services , to fetch or carry . This because self-sacrifice al ? ways enhances self-esteem . One thinks : " What a fine person I am ! " It is notori ? ous that martyrs are vain . So much in general . For the detail , the lover must use such tact as is left him by his gentle passion . He must measure his ardor if lie can , but always obtain a little more than the beloved seems willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek should be captured : however much this may seem to annoy , it increases in the beloved a pleasant sense of male dominance . " These men , " she says , " they will be men . Outra ? geous creatures . But can one do without them ? " It may be that all this sounds too technical to please ; it is n't , really . Who worries over the technic of a tal ? ented violinist ? Only the critics . Those who like the tune think only of that , and so it does not seem blasphemous to set up a score for the greatest of all hymns . There is nothing tricky in this ; on such simple arts rested the natural play of the satyr and the nymph ; it is that of the birds of the air , of the deer in the forest . It is worth while considering how to play the best of hymns on the exquisite instrument that is a woman 's heart . And a short hymn it must be , played only during courtship , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
