combine is a farm machine , a mobile factory that separates grain and seed from husk and stalk and pod , Think of it as a tunnel that connects the natural to the human world , a cornucopia ; these days it comes sized proportionately . The big red Case International combine that Tom Bauer wheeled from the darkness of its storage shed one morning late last August , engine growling and seven picker-head snouts thrust forward , looked as commanding as the front end of a Boeing 747 . A forty-seven-year-old farmer who works the deep , rolling farmland of central Missouri , Tom Bauer was beginning his twenty-fifth harvest since he had started farming on his own . Before that , back to childhood seasons hardly now recalled , he had helped his father harvest rented farmland . Despite the rural depression of the Reagan years , Tom was doing well enough . Autumn was his favorite time of year : it was the season of gathering , when he saw the results of his spring and summer labors , when the cornucopia flowed . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to travel around the Midwest leading a country band . Then he was drafted . One day toward the end of his Army stint at Fort Sill , Oklahoma , his dad turned up and asked him if he wanted to farm . The proposed arrangement was n't the best : William Bauer was speaking on behalf of an elderly farmer so impossible to work for that he 'd driven his own sons out of farming . But Tom said yes , he Richard Rhodes is the author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb . He is at work on a book about farm life in the Midwest . All of the names in this article have been changed . thought he wanted to farm . He married in 1964 ; he and his wife , Sally , bought their first forty acres in 1967 . Now Tom and Sally own 350 acres . Tom also farms another 750 acres for three different landlords , sharing the crops fifty-fifty . He raises cattle and hogs and grows wheat , corn , and soybeans . Sally keeps the books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch in when they can . Tom 's combine was dusty with soybean chaff . He had been exhausted when he put it away for the season on New Year 's Eve , 1985 , and had n't given it his usual post-harvest cleanup . Tom and two other men had helped a neighbor finish a soybean harvest made late by wet fields and combine troubles , running their four machines all night for four nights in a row to find traction on frozen ground , quitting in midmorning when the ground thawed to impassable mud . Confident of his skills as a mechanic , Tom rarely buys new machinery , preferring to let someone else take the large initial depreciation that distinguishes new equipment from used . His model 1460 rotary combine sold new in 1979 for $80,000 , He bought it in 1983 for $18,000 , of which he still owes half . It is his pride and joy and without question the most important piece of mobile machinery on his farm . A combine comes in two parts : a snouted picker head for corn and the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working surface of Tom 's rotary combine is a steel tube the size of a torpedo ( called a rotary ) that runs the length of the machine 's interior up a thirteen-degree incline . Turned by a 180-horsepower diesel engine through pulleys attached to its upper end , the rotary spins at high speed inside a rifled steel cylinder , transporting back through the machine the dry stalks and leaves of the grain being harvested . Sixteen hardened-steel rasp bars , grooved like gargantuan files , are bolted to the rotary near its front end . They crush stalks and ears of corn down against concave steel gratings fixed below , breaking everything up . Grain falls through the spaces in the " concaves , " as the gratings are called , while crushed stalks and cobs are barber-poled onward and upward to be dumped onto " sieves , " toothed screens in the rear of the machine that knock loose any fugitive grain that still clings . Augers lift the clean grain up to the top of the combine , where it pours into a 185-bushel holding bin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumps of mud discharges out the rear end , later to be disked back into the soil . Tom removed two panels from the left side of the combine , down under and behind the cab , and then the three awkward , heavy steel concaves . With penetrating oil and main force he unbolted the old rasp bars and replaced them one by one . They were original parts , worn rounded by seven years of harvests . He worked steadily all day , cramped between the side of the combine and one of the six-foot-high tires , stopping for occasional drafts of water from the well tap at the side of the workshop and combine is enclosed and air-conditioned , and a serviceman arrived the following morning to top off the Freon in the air-conditioning system . Tom and his wife would spend more than two hundred hours during the next three months driving the combine day and night through boiling clouds of chaff , mold , insects , and dust , in humid ninety-degree heat and in cutting twenty-degree cold . Nothing pains him more than hearing poorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers and their " air-conditioned tractors . " " That 's just ignorant , " he says . " I used to come in at night with the dust chills . Lie there shivering and cough and cough until the middle of the night , trying to get that old dust up out of my lungs . Farmer 's lung used to be near as bad as the black lung miners get . It 's just like in a factory . Controlling the cab environment saves lives , that 's all . " The combine 's radiators needed hosing off , which Tom accomplished with a Handy power washer hooked up to his well line . He went on to blast dried and hardened mud off the combine housing , where the big tires had flung it spinning through his neighbor 's muddy , half-frozen field . He changed oil filters , removed two spreader fans at the hack that he did n't need forachievement and the bane of American farming in recent years . Last year was no different . Four billion bushels of corn remained in storage from 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break records . The manager of the elevator where Tom would sell some of his grain told him that there appeared to be insufficient storage space for the new crop . Commercial elevators were setting their quality standards higher than usual and giving first call on storage space to customers who bought fertilizer from them . This year Tom 's elevator would n't accept corn with more than 20 percent moisture and would pay less for anything with above 15 percent . From day to day Tom drove to one or another of his fields , where he would pick an ear of corn and shell it into a small canister he carried that contained a battery-powered moisture-testing unit . He would n't start combining until the moisture in the corn in his most mature field was below 22 percent . The day finally came : September 8 , a Monday . Tom spent the early afternoon helping his neighbor Clarence Galen handle nineteen calves that needed worming and castrating . Finally , at two in the afternoon , he drove his combine to a landlord 's field two miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sparse outside rows of buff , rustling corn , and announced formally to the grasshoppers and squirrels : " So the 1986 harvest begins . " He 'd been noticeably tense all day , a tremor of excitement in his hands . He had wanted to begin picking corn earlier , but the vet was nearly an hour late arriving at Clarence 's . He left the Galen place in uncharacteristic haste as soon as the last calf had been run through the vet 's squeeze chute . His sixteen-year-old son , Brett , would be playing junior varsity football in town at five o'clock , and he wanted to make the game . But now he 'd begun , and the ears were thick and full in the planting beyond the edge rows where the deer fed . Tom picked two grain wagons full of corn that afternoon , 600 bushels , 34,000 pounds , the first corn of the harvest , and missed only the opening quarter of the game . Brett made a crucial tackle and the home team won . The next morning dawned cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather of the day before , the sky nearly overcast and a chance of rain . Tom was raring to go . Before the rain came he hoped to finish picking the fifteen-acre bottomland field he 'd started yesterday ; mud would make it impassable for weeks . Tom picked corn before soybeans , bottomland fields before hillsides , and his landlords ' fields before his own . Sally arrived in the better GMC pickup at 8:45 to take over running the combine while Tom unloaded grain . " I make Tom ride the firstround with me every year , " she says , " to make sure I remember all the switches and gears . " Sally was a small-town girl , and Tom 's sisters were n't sure she would take to farming , but she 's worked at Tom 's side off and on for more than twenty years and she handles the combine like a pro . She used to drive the big diesel trucks back and forth to the storage bins or the elevator to dump the grain . Two years ago she asked Tom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the field , the combine working through the corn , picking six rows at a time , sounds like a big commercial jet roaring in the distance . With its angular , multi-windowed head , its snouts mowing down the rows , its rear end steering crablike , it looks like a monster bug , the steel equivalent of a biblical horde of locusts . From inside the cab the picking process is slapstick comedy . Passing between the picker-head snouts , the tall stalks of corn shudder and begin flailing and then suddenly go wobbly , their legs giving way . The snapping rollers between the snouts seem to jerk them straight down into perdition . Actually , they 're chopped into pieces , their heavy , solid ears of feed corn knocked loose and shucked just like that , nothing left but huff-colored chop and yellow ears tumbling along the big traverse feed au- ger toward the mouth of the picker throat , which gulps them up . The ears of corn thump against the snouts as they 're torn loose , one and sometimes two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the crop 's knocking on the door , and it feels good . After years of combining , a farmer can almost estimate his yield per acre from the vigor of that knocking . While Sally picked corn , Tom dumped it , first the two grain wagons he 'd loaded the day before , then a shuttle of wagons and trucks . He had three corrugated-steel storage bins available on the farm of another of his landlords a mile up the road . The bin he would use for this field 's corn , the middle one , held 6,300 bushels . He had already set his big fifty-two-foot grain auger in place in preparation for the harvest . Its feed end rested in a catch pit he had dug and lined with a piece of canvas from an old Army tent ; it angled up three stories into the air , ending in a spout lowered over the uncapped hatch of the steel bin . The auger is a galvanized steel Archimedean screw supported on a two-wheeled carriage and turned by the power takeoff of a 1953 Farmall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Harvester made . Today Tom 's other machines dwarf it . He keeps it around for just such modest duties . With one of his big White tractors , which have Caterpillar diesel engines , Tom moved a grain wagon into position with its spout directly over the auger catch pit . Starting up the Farm-all , he engaged the power takeoff , lowered the spout , and cranked open the spout door . The corn began to flow out , pouring like water into the auger . It was warm from its night in the wagon , its warmth the heat of fermentation . At 18 percent moisture , it needed to be dried . The auger , beating rhythmically as its screw turned , carried the corn up to the top of the bin . Tom walked to an outlet box on a nearby post and plugged in a long yellow extension cord . It connected to an electric motor inside the storage bin , up under the roof , that ran a rotating steel paddle , a spreader , which interrupted the flowing fall of the corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread it evenly and prevent it from coning up and blocking the hatch . Next Tom started up the blower fan , housed in a tunnel like a stubby jet engine , which he would run day and night whenever the humidity was below 50 percent to dry the corn . Truck engines , tractor engines , the bear of the big auger , the racket of the spreader , the banshee wail of the blower : the harvest at its storage end was anything but pastoral . Tom 's friend Clarence Galen , a World War II veteran with a weathered face , trim and vigorous at sixty-three , arrived from the field with a load of Bauer corn on his truck . Embarrassed thathe 'd delayed Tom with the work on his calves the day before , he 'd driven over to help out . Tom moved the emptied grain wagon out of the way . Clarence backed the truck to the catch pit and raised its bed with a built-in hydraulic hoist to dump the corn . A few days later , Clarence turned up and announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated 182 bushels to the acre , an exceptional yield in commercial fanning . Tom averages 130 . " Them ears just crowded in that auger , " Clarence said happily . " Just flowed in . " " You sure know how to hurt a fellow , " Tom said . " Ruin his day . I 'll have to do you better , Clarence . You should n't tell the other guy first . " The two men get together whenever the weather is bad or the ground is too wet to work . It was gray and foggy that day , chilly , the humidity 92 percent , the wind picking up out of the east , big brown sycamore leaves rolling like tumbleweeds across the farm . The day before had been sticky with heat ; now it was autumn . Tom had parked two tractors and two grain wagons west of the old silo behind the workshop on his farm . Whenever Molly noticed them she barked , thinking them intruders . Then the rains began . " Mother Nature , " Clarence said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What had looked to be an easy harvest became a mire . Tom measured fifteen inches of rain at his farm in September , almost half the rainfall central Missouri usually gets in an entire year . He could n't pick corn . When he could pick corn , he could n't dry it because the humidity was too high . In the meantime , his soybeans sprouted in their pods and mildewed . The rains stopped long enough one weekend to pick a choice bottomland field . On that level , straight-rowed surface Brett drove the combine for the first time , work that moved Torn to quiet tears . " It brought back a lot of memories . I remember my dad sitting on the tractor watching me run the corn picker . I had real strong feelings about it . " Tom was happy to see signs that his son was becoming interested in farming , but he was n't sure he should encourage him . Clarence stopped by Tom 's workshop one rainy day with a joke . " You heard about the new John Deere tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got no seat or steering wheel . It 's for guys who 've lost their ass and do n't know , ' here to turn . " The men laughed , sheltered from the cold drizzle inside the workshop . The laughter sounded rueful . Sixty thousand American farmers went out of business in 1986 . By the end of September , despite the rain , Tom had finished picking all of his corn . He had worked on weekends , trucked grain ( on which he knew he 'd he docked for excess moisture ) to the elevator , and filled his storage bin with corn he 'd have to dry to save from rot . The humidity stayed high . Tom decided that he 'd have to add heat to his drying system . The blower on the corn bin had a built-in propane burner , but Torn had n't used it since he bought the blower new in 1973 . Propane had been more expensive in previous years , and the weather had never been so wet . Monday morning , September 29 , Tom drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in a central Missouri market town . He bought a $60 transformer , heavy and black as a car battery , to replace the transformer on the blower that charged the spark plug that ignited the propane ring . Later that day Tom met Joe , his propane man , and they drove to the bin . Joe charged a penny or two more per gallon for his propane , but he knew propane equipment well enough to be called in as a consultant by factories as far away as Kansas City , and he repaired his customers ' broken equipment for free . Joe kept a plug of snuff tucked under the right side of his lower lip . On his way out of town he had picked up a special solenoid valve for Tom , saving him a trip . The two men removed the old transformer and solenoid and installed the replacements . Orange-and-black caterpillars crawled on the bin and underfoot . Foxtail and wild marijuana grew thickly behind the storage bins . Neither man knew the particular unit they were repairing , nor did they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe started to remove the front panel , obviously intending to rewire it , replacing wires that had lost their insulation and might short out . " You that brave ? " Tom asked . " 1 just do n't want to get bit , " Joe explained . " That electricity bite you ? " " Did yesterday . " " The housing ? " " Bare wire . " Joe plugged in the big 220-volt plug and tried the push button that was supposed to light the burner . Nothing happened . He unplugged and reopened the front panel and switched a wire . Tom unscrewed a plate from the blower housing so that they could see inside . Joe pushed the starter button again . The spark plug clicked and fired . " I see it , " Tom said . Joe switched on the blower , and the fan started its banshee wail . Then he eased on the propane . A blast of heat came out of the hole Tom had opened , followed by the sweetish smell of burning propane . " Great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With $97 worth of propane , Tom saved his corn . He still had soybeans to harvest . That work would continue through a wet fall into early January , the latest he 'd finished a harvest in twenty-five years . Tom Bauer grew a total of 155 acres of corn for himself last year , yielding about 20,000 bushels . He fed half of that corn to his hogs and cattle over the winter . ( " My dad , " he explains , " used to say it 's better to let your corn walk off the farm . " ) Tom did better financially in 1986 than he had in any of the previous five years , primarily because hog prices have been high , above $50 a hundredweight when his break-even costs run about $44 . The other half of his corn crop remained in storage , held against a possible improvement in the market price . Tom is an efficient farmer . By buying used equipment , limiting borrowing , taking cash discounts , and watching for bargains , he holds his costs down . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,200 on hybrid seed , $1,000 on herbicides , $540 on insecticides , $2,150 on nitrogen fertilizer , and $500 on tractor fuel . Depreciation on his equipment ? tractors , chisel plow , disk , field cultivator , planter , combine ? came to $2,300 . There were other expenses : repairs , lime , hired labor , drying , storage . Not counting Tom 's labor or the labor of his family , it all added up to a cost of production per bushel of about $1.60 . The market price of corn at the end of January 1987 was $1.45 . As a result , the United States government will end up owning Tom 's corn . Having complied with the legal restraints on how many acres he could plant , Torn qualifies for a government loan of $1.88 per bushel at 8.75 percent interest . If the market price does n't beat the loan price within nine months ( not a likely prospect , given the glut ) , the government will foreclose the loan , forgo interest , and take the corn , effectively buying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents per bushel , $2,800 . " We joke and laugh , " Tom said one day , " but in the back of our minds we 've got it that there 's hard times down the road . The fat 's been rendered out . All those had managers and plungers you used to hear about are gone . I do n't see where it 's going . Six years ago we had a net worth of $450,000 . That 's been just about cut in half . You ask our city cousins and bankers if they could take a 50 to 60 percent cut in pay and still meet their commitments . That 's it in a nutshell . " By tightening his belt , repairing what he has rather than replacing it , forgoing vacations and luxuries , Tom Bauer has succeeded ? so far ? in weathering a pervasive rural depression . Looking to the beginning of a new crop year in the spring of 1987 , taking stock , he asked himself more than once how much longer he could continue to beat the odds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
