When Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin visited the occupied West Bank last week , he was taken to task by a local Palestinian Arab . " If the ( Jewish ) settlers start beating our boys , Israeli soldiers watch and do nothing , " complained Abdullah Sa'afin , 24 . " But if one of our boys throws a stone , we get live bullets directed at the chests of our children . " <P> The remark was prompted by the death of a twelve-year-old Palestinian boy named Ramadan Zeitun , who was shot last week during disturbances at the Balata refugee camp near the West Bank town of Nablus . At first it was assumed that the boy had died after Israeli soldiers fired into a crowd of rioters . Later it appeared that he may have been shot by a carful of local Israeli settlers . Either way , his death symbolizes the confusion and chaos that beset the West Bank as it undergoes the worst round of violence there since the spring of 1982 . <P> The latest bloodletting erupted two weeks ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles north of Jerusalem , launched a demonstration against the Israeli occupation . Specifically , they were objecting to a temporary roadblock that had been erected by the Israelis . When Israeli soldiers advanced , the students threw stones , and the soldiers responded with tear gas and then bullets . Two students , both of them 22 , were killed instantly . The next day a 14-year-old was shot dead at the Balata refugee camp , where three days later Zeitun was killed . Skirmishes flared as soldiers fought running street battles with youthful Palestinians . Meanwhile , the Israelis set up additional roadblocks , checking identity cards and searching for arms . <P> At the United Nations , the Security Council condemned the shootings by a vote of 14 to 0 , with the U.S. abstaining . The Israeli government , maintaining that its forces had only acted in self-defense , expressed disappointment that Washington had not vetoed the resolution . It also charged that the mass demonstrations were the result of efforts by the Palestine Liberation Organization to stage a comeback in the region at the expense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jerusalem : " The P.L.O . feels frustrated that it is not succeeding . It has been thrown to the wolves by Hussein , and it 's afraid of seeing its grip lessened in the West Bank . After all , there has been a major attempt by Hussein to restore his own influence in the territory . " <P> That effort began last February shortly after the split between Hussein and P.L.O . Chairman Yasser Arafat , who had failed in their efforts to pursue a joint peace strategy . The collapse of that coalition has deepened the existing political divisions among the 1.3 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Declaring that his aim is to " revive the Palestinian economy , " the King announced several weeks ago a contribution of $34 million toward a $l billion , five-year development plan for the West Bank . Among the goals are a rebuilding of factories , schools and other basic services .
