ANTIQUARIANS and philoso- phers have lately had a fine opportunity to do some first class observing at the northwest corner of ' Washington Square , where they are digging a hole preparatory to building an apartment house . Years ago , before Washington Square was built up , it was a swampy district , known as good duck-shooting country , and watered by Minetta Creek . What can be observed at the moment is nothing less than this same Minetta Creek being pumped out of the hole and running merrily down the gutter of Waverly Place . The cheerful probability , say philosophers , is that this earnest little stream will still be running when New York has ceased to exist . WE HAVE long realized that young business and professional men who live on the fringes of society , and whose ambitions are hopelessly greater than their incomes , are quite the funniest men in the city .

POOR posterity got it in the neck again last week when Mr. Ziegfeld had his new theatre dedicated .

It is " Sam Abramovitch , " the work of one Francais Porche , who , asking no royalties for himself , has made Miss tletoe , hard candy and reindeer , toilet sets and holly , traveling kits and Santa Clauses , chemises and chimneys , smoking jackets and starry skies  --  a tinsel medley , a jazz cam . Unanimity of purpose in the shops puts an end to ales resistance : drunk with the sheen of silver and snow , one rushes in and buys ... buys anything ! And the unanimity is apparent .

Through it all comes only one mournful note  --  the holly in the windows is not real ! The leaves are soft , the round berries shine like maraschino cherries . What has happened to real holly  --  the old-fash ioned prickly kind ? Only in Car-tier 's did this prying observer find what appeared to he solid , eighteen-karat holly berries and even then we were not sure and frosted the pane with our breath trying to verify it .

" It 'll look better when I have my hair curled , wo n't it ? " Nichols a present of the drama as a tribute to her genius . When M. Porche was in America several winters ago he went to see " . Abie 's Irish Rose " and left the theatre in a state of giddy rapture , assuring the author that she was the American Moliere . Since the man spoke no English he was handicapped in his desire to dash off a similar play in French , and he asked Miss Nichols to help him gather material for it . So for several weeks they spent their evenings touring the kosher sections of the city by limousine , peering into the East side soul . The result is a story of a Jewish immigrant to America , and it is being produced by Anne Nichols , Inc . THE NEW YORKER 21 The explanation of that incorporation , by the way , is to be found in the affable person of Mr. William de Lignemare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serene figure on Broadway . He is very dark , very round , and is the type one can not imagine without a cigar . He started life in the French diplomatic service , spent some years as a banker abroad , and finally arrived on these shores to gratify his love of the theatre . After experimenting with electric stage appliances for various managers , he joined Anne Nichols ' forces , then guiding " Abie 's Irish Rose " through its third year . The business end of Miss Nichols ' organization became M. de Lignemare 's mission in life , and he set to work to introduce modern banking methods into the rather chaotic show-business . Every detail of the performance was standardized , so that the couple who saw the play years ago in New York may attend a performance in Detroit today and find no jarring change in costume or stage set . Elaborate daily eeports of the work of each actor were ordered and sent to the main office , even by the company which is playing in Australia . One trick , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. de Lignemare employed in connection with road companies . Insteadof going into the obvious and more pretentious theatres , in many cities he sought out obscure ones , frequently unused , hired them cheaply and saved considerable difference in rental . PERHAPS Mr. de Lignemare 's greatest coup was introducing the seniority system to the theatrical world ? for Anne Nichols , Inc. , now engages only actresses who arc young enough to play the part of the flower-girl ; if they make good and attain their full growth , they arc promoted to the lead ; as time goes on they will grow old in the company 's service and be assigned the parts of Mrs. Cohen , and one presumes eventually will be pensioned . In the meantime the system works well  --  in five years not a single member of the company has been discharged , in spite of the stringent rule that any actor arriving at the theatre with liquor on his breath is to be instantly dismissed . Only one thing Mr. De Lignemare has been unable to borrow from the business world  --  banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which have the suave dignity of a Union Club , almost anytime between nine and nine . His foresight is such that he keeps a chauffeur always on duty in London awaiting his occasional visits , as he will never trust a strange driver and his American chauffeurs are not accustomed to driving to the left . His boast is that he would rather be Anne Nichols ' general manager than ambassador to England , and he considers her the greatest living woman author . To back this he will intimate that " Abie 's Irish Rose " will be sold to the movies in a few months for the sum of two million . ? WE WERE stopped on Central Park West yesterday by an acquaintance who insisted that we ought to say something about a new apartment house in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn which has just been christened the Buildmore .

' " Ominous IN THE hectic world of bridge a rumble as of distant thunder signifies the coming of Contract Bridge . Last spring it was a cloud no bigger THE NEW YORKER than a man 's hand , but during the Summer , Newport took it up  --  all of Newport that was able to graduate from Auction  --  and it spread to some of the smarter corners of Long Island too . One now hears of it in all parts of town ; it has been more or less generally adopted in our most exclusive sets , and there are those who say that it will have swept the whole East Side and be threatening Great Neck before the season is done . Intensive efforts made in our behalf to trace the history of Contract Bridge have failed , but it seems to have started somewhere in this country , going abroad from here . Men in their middle thirties report that they played it while at college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club " seven or eight years ago ; it was seen in China ten years ago , etc. , etc . Unquestionably , it gained a real vogue in Austria after the war , when kronen were worth little , although it declined in popularity as money became worth more . And it is certain that the present American vogue is largely attributable to the popularity of the game in France , where it has been widely played under the name of Plat ond . It is certain , moreover , that Contract is five times as steep as Auction and about five times as difficult ; that if you play Auction for half a cent you must play Contract for one-tenth ; that if you play an inexpert game and rely on drawing good cards you will lose your shirt . All of which is set down as a word of warning for those plebeians who are still ignorant and innocent . THE PRINCIPAL difficulty at present is that there are no official rules . The Knickerbocker and Cavendish Clubs have n't undertaken to father the game . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play it , but the most that can really be said for these clubs is that they are open-minded about it . Contract enthusiasts say they will be forced to take it up ; the conservatives suggest that , at best , it will be years before they do anything much about the rules . In the meantime a set of rules devised by Mr. Harold Vanderbilt is accepted as final . Mr. Jesse Livermore of Wall Street has also worked out a set . These gentlemen are both great players . There arc many who say that Mr. Vanderbilt is the best bridge player in the world  --  or the hardest to beat . He plays Contract in practically all his idle hours now  --  Racquet Club in the afternoons , private parties in the evening , and he is said to have cleared a sum equal to the salary of twenty-Eve minor executives at Newport last Summer . Reflection OO UR weekly story of journalism concerns a girls ' preparatory school noted for the rigorousness of its courses , one of which is in English composition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous newspaper men in town . Well , one day last week Daughter came home for the week-end and said the assignment for Monday in English was a three-inch story , written in newspaper style . So she asked her father whether he would n't  --  as a sort of joke on Teacher and the class write it for her . He wrote a story about the Bronx Zoo . She handed it in . " You know that story you gave me last week , " she said . " Well , guess what mark I got in it . . . Zero ! She said it was just terrible . I have to do another one this week , but if you ca n't do better , I 'll do it myself .

" Privileges HH OCKEY has returned to the Garden , and the concentration of opera hats and evening cloaks observed there warrants mention of that favored new organization , the Madison Square Club , for some of the wearers are probably members . When the new structure was contemplated the New York Trust Company had something to do with its financing and as a consequence of this connection , Mr. Harvey Gibson began the organization of the club . It was to be limited to a membership of three hundred congenial men , it was to be entitled to six hundred seats at the ringside for every fight at box-office prices , as well as fights that Rickard promoted elsewhere , and it was to be provided with club rooms in the building adjoining the Garden and fronting on Eighth Avenue , these to include checking and refreshment facilities and a connection with the arena by a private passage-way . The plan has matured as was hoped . The membership already totals nearly three hundred ( generally ? THE NEW YORKER 23 representative , although banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters are shortly to be opened , and the passage-way too . A generally satisfactory arrangement . Mr. Rickard gets a group of the better people conspicuously near the center of interest , and the better people get to the center of interest in an appropriate manner , at all times avoiding contact with the rabble . ? pADRAIC COLUM , the Irish I poet , lectured in Iowa not long ago and last Thursday there arrived in town a high school teacher who had heard him in Des Moines . Boarding a Madison Avenue car , she was excited to see thereon a gentleman who from his face , his ulster , spats , cane and soft gray hat was obviously Mr. Colum . She got a seat beside him and , after a moment , remarked : " Pardon me , but I heard you lecture in Des Moines last week . " " Vott ? " said the gentleman . Impressions THE DEATH in France last week of Claude Monet caused little stir . It is not that art folk forget their giants , but Monet 's activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pursuit of the finer variants of a technique he had long since helped to perfect . He was eighty-six , and a long way past the troublesome era of his youth when men fought duels over schools of art . His latter years were spent in his garden painting the same thing over and over again , to catch the object in different phases of sunlight . ' The news of his death will revive a problem that has troubled many a lay mind in this busy civilization . There were two of them , Mallet and Monet ; which was which ? For a time the erudite could always say " Manet is the one who is dead , " but that easy formula will no longer work . The lay mind is not to be blamed . It was young Manet himself who discovered another young upstart apparently using a corruption of his name and an imitation of his style . Seeking the other out , he found that there actually was a person by the name of Monet , an artist in his own right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impressionism ; together they fought many battles . And if it will help fix the fact in mind , it was Manet who , by his new technique , was the father of Impressionism , his seeds that have filled our fields with fruit now lumped as Modern . But it was Monet who holds title to naming the school . His picture , entitled " Impressions at Sunrise , " was thrown out of the Academy on its ear , but later was hung in a dark corridor . It set up such a stir that it became a symbol of the new kind of painting  --  the breaking up of pigment as against the old smooth method of brush-work . Of the contending parties following that episode , those who followed that school were called " Impressionists , " a term commonly misused today . ?
