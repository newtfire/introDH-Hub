THE OPERA AND RADIO CITY . To the Edt:or of The New York Times : Maybe you will agree with me that our glorious Metropolitan Opera House does not belong in Radio City . It seems strange to me that even the hint of such a calamity is passed by unnoticed by our thousands upon thousands of opera lovers . For the richest , biggest city in the world giving us opera as nowhere else in the world , we surely should have an opera house befitting our city and our growing music - loving public . Rather let us wait a few years and have an opera house worthy the name and tradition of our Metropolitan and New York City . The older people who know opera since the days of Lilli Lehmann and Alvary love our Metropolitan , the memories and tradition that go with our beloved opera house , its environment , its glorious horseshoe interior , the glorious proscenium arch with its more glorious golden curtain ; we beg for something grand and glorious as this in the years to come , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or overlooking our splendid Central Park . Somewhere , something , to point to with pride and glory as our Metropolitan Opera House , and that means  --  not in Radio City ! Has the musical public nothing to say ? MUSIC LOVER . New York , April 20 , 1932.
