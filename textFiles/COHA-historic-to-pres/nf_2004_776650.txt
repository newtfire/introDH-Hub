Planting Seeds // WYNNEWOOD , OKLAHOMA JUNE 1950 // My understanding of the world and its consequences - of right and wrong , good and evil - began when I was five in central Oklahoma . That may be hard to believe , but it 's true . // It was my father , Ray Franks , who taught me those lessons . // " You pull up just as hard as you push down , Tommy Ray , " Dad said . He was trimming two-by-fours for our barn roof with a handsaw on the tailgate of the old Ford pickup . The saw blade snarled down through the board and ripped up with a thinner sound . His right arm , tanned like leather under the short sleeve of a washed-out shirt , bulged as he leaned his stocky weight into the saw . // It was summer , nice in the shade of the cottonwood trees near the barn . I was barefoot , in faded bib overalls that were getting short in the legs , sitting in the dirt , watching my father work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . He smiled a lot and liked to josh around . But when we were alone together , my dad often took a moment to explain the things he 'd learned in his life . // " Here , Tommy Ray , " he said , tossing me a couple of splintery cuttings . " You can play with these blocks . " // " But , Dad , they ai n't real toys . " // " Are n't real toys , " he corrected , flipping another board end to me . " But they are , you see . A few years back , kids had to make do with toys their daddies made for them . They could n't just drive to the five-and-dime in town and buy ready-made . " // I fingered the wood , still hot from the saw blade . " How come ? " // He wiped his face with a handkerchief , laid another plank across the tailgate , and lined up the saw . " Well , Tommy Ray , we had a war . Most of the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight the Germans and the Japanese . Millions and millions of guys my age and younger were soldiers and sailors and flyers and had to go fight . " // Fight , I thought . That was like when the barnyard chickens went rolling around , pecking and squawking . Or like when the big kids walking to school in the winter threw ice balls . But what would make a million soldiers and sailors fight ? // " How come , Dad ? " // " Bad people , Tommy Ray . The Japanese attacked us at a place called Pearl Harbor . It went on for years , and a lot of our boys did n't come home . " // " Where 'd they go ? " // Father laid down the saw and smiled that soft grin he had when he needed to explain something sad , like when Ginger the cat got hit by a truck . " Well , those boys got killed . They died for America , Tommy Ray . " // My mother said people went to heaven when they died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got to heaven . // " Did you go fight ? " // " I was in the Army Air Corps , Tommy Ray . I fixed airplanes for the boys to fly . I did n't have to fight , but I think my job was important . " // In my mind 's eye , I could see my father fixing airplanes with shiny propellers . He could mend anything - the electric water heater for the bathroom , the truck , the tractor , all the different plows and reapers . Folks were always bringing their broken things to the farm for Ray Franks to fix . Mother told me that Dad could never say no if people needed help . // " Did you go to Pearl Harbor ? " // My father shook his head , smiling . " No , Tommy Ray . I went to a place called the Panama Canal Zone . They 've got palm trees down there , and really pretty birds called parrots . " // " Mother did n't have to fight , did she ? " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . Lots of men , too . The whole country went to work . People planted victory gardens for their food . The boys in my Scout troop collected tin cans and newspapers . Things were scarce . That 's why children could n't always have new toys , why their dads or uncles had to make them blocks and doll houses . " // My father always explained things so I could see a picture . So many years later , I recall that afternoon clearly . This was my first appreciation of war . What I learned was clear : Bad people started wars , and Americans had to go fight . I already understood about cats getting run over . About steers going to the slaughterhouse . Now I saw that whenever wars were started , some boys did n't come home . // " Will I have to go fight ? " // My father stacked the trimmed boards up against the fender and sighed . " Tommy Ray , I hope not . But you get used to playing with those blocks I just cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a place called Korea . I think America is in for another trying time , son . " // I set my blocks in a square and then leaned forward to scratch in the dirt between my ankles , fascinated by the little rust-colored bugs swarming up from the ground . They looked angry , like a million soldiers . // " Oh , hey ... " I yelped . The bugs were crawling up my legs and biting . " Dad ... " // He snatched me up with one arm and shook the flapping legs of my overalls . " Tommy Ray , you were sitting on an anthill . Those little devils are red ants , son . They 're nasty . " // We were at the garden spigot now , and Dad ran the water over my ankles . It felt cool . But in my mind I pictured crowds of soldiers with guns like my father 's 12-gauge shotgun , boiling out of the ground , just like the ants . // That night , I had my bath , said my prayers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go to sleep right away . I 'd learned important new information out in the shade of the cottonwoods . When there are wars , boys go to fight , mothers work hard , and kids like me go without toys . // ( Continues ... ) //
