No intelligent pessimist , seeking omens and portents of business depression , will allow himself to glance at the recent history of U. S. mail order houses . Balance sheets of Sears Roebuck and of Montgomery Ward are the particular pride of bulls , the dull despair of bears . In 1921 , Year of Deflation , Sears Roebuck admitted an operating loss of $16,435,468 . And Montgomery Ward showed a loss of $9,887,396 . But in 1922 , both companies declared net profits of about $5,000,000 . By 1927 , Montgomery Ward could show profits of $13,127,431 , and Sears Roebuck nearly twice as much . Estimating 1928 profits , analysts see large gains over 1927 figures , with Montgomery Ward fighting desperately to narrow the gap which separates it from its rival . <P> Equally astonishing has been the skyrocketing of Montgomery Ward securities* on the New York Stock Exchange . From the beginning of the great bull market , Montgomery Ward has been well in line with the leaders . Its record : <P> <P> HIGH LOW <P> 1923 26 18 <P> 1924 48 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 123 ? 60 <P> <P> But in 1928 , the stock began a sustained , sensational rise . Its low for the year , 117 , was reached on Jan. 19 . By Feb. 8 , it had hit 149 . Responding to the two brief periods of market weakness , it lost 20 points in the last week of February , won them back , then lost 10 points in the week ending June 16 . Sharp and spectacular was its recovery . It soared : <P> <P> July 7 ( week ending ) 159 ? <P> Aug. 11 199 ? <P> Sept. 15 264 <P> Oct. 13 282 <P> <P> On Monday , Oct. 15 , the exchange opened with Montgomery Ward the centre of all eyes . Rumors flew fast . Traders heard that good news was on the way . Monday saw Montgomery Ward leap to 304 . Tuesday added 1 points . <P> And on Tuesday the good news came . From Chicago , President George B. Everitt+ wrote stockholders . Interesting was the promise that Jan. 1 would see 200 chain stores in operation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1,285,000 to 6,000,000 shares , giving stockholders the right to buy two new shares , at $17.50 each , for every share now held . <P> By the end of the week , when the stock had gone to 352 , traders were swamped under an avalanche of orders . In a single day , 58,900 shares changed hands . Many a fortune had been made within the year , within the week . Jealously guarded , names and specialties of pool operators are known to few stockmarketeers . But Arthur W. Cutten and the Brothers Fisher did not deny they had scored again in a market dedicated to bulls . <P> <P> * Sears Roebuck stock , less spectacular , has not lagged behind the advance . From a low of 51 in January , 1927 , it climbed to a 1928 high , last fortnight , of 162 . <P> + South Dakota-born George Bain Everitt was first accountant , then cloak-and-suitman . He went into the Encyclopedia Brittanica Corp. , dropped it for the textile business . In 1921 he went to Montgomery Ward , becoming president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clan of young , debonair , clubmen-executives.
