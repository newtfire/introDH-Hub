In the storm of recriminations in Egypt that followed the Achille Lauro fiasco , the provocative leftist weekly Al Ahaly asked a pertinent question : " Will the crime of hijacking the Egyptian plane be the calamity that puts us back on the right track , which we have forsaken for the last 15 years ? " By that the paper meant , Will Egypt at last acknowledge the folly of maintaining close ties with the United States and take a more independent approach to resolving the Arab-Israeli dispute and reviving the economy ? A break with the United States by the most powerful Arab state  --  the only one to have signed a peace treaty with Israel  --  would have almost as profound an impact on the region as the Iranian revolution had . Officially the Egyptians say no change is in the offing . President Hosni Mubarak is trying to undo whatever damage his hot words about " piracy " might have caused him in Washington following the U.S. interception of the Egyptian airliner carrying the Achille Lauro hijackers . By granting U.S. " antiterrorist " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-fated storming of the hijacked Egypt-air jet in Malta , he gratified his American patrons . ( Maltese officials prevented the United States from direct participation . ) Now he is allowing the joint U.S.-Egyptian military exercises planned for this month to go ahead , , although the Arab press had reported that he intended to cancel them . He is also resuming talks with the Israelis on border disputes , which he had suspended to protest the October 1 bombing of Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters near Tunis . No one should be fooled by Mubarak 's attempts to pretend that all is well between Cairo and Washington and that even Egyptian-Israeli relations are not so bad . The displays of anti-American and anti-Israeli feeling in Egypt in the past two months have been more than isolated outbursts of emotion . The " normal " and " neighborly " relations with Israel prescribed in the 1979 peace treaty negotiated at Camp David have not materialized . As the Egyptian economy deteriorates and the peace process remains stalled , it is becoming increasingly difficult for Mubarak to justify the close relationship with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both fronts . To give just one example , in last year 's parliamentary election the three main opposition parties took positions highly critical of the Camp David accords , and Mubarak 's own National Democratic Party thought it the better part of valor to minimize . the nation 's ties with the United States and Israel . Stanley Reed is a writer who specializes on the Middle East . Its 8,000-word platform mentioned neither Camp David nor Anwar el-Sadat , the party 's founder . Many close observers of U.S.-Egyptian relations say that a confrontation like the one that occurred over how to dispoSe of the Achille Lauro hijackers was inevitable . Mohammed Hakki , a Washington-based consultant who served as press counselor at the Egyptian Embassy frOm 1975 to 1981 and as head of the State Information Service from 1981 to 1982 , was in Cairo shortly after the incident and was able to compare the reactions of officials and journalists in both capitals . " It was like being on two completely different planets , " he said . " There is a complete lack of proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly a factor in- the debacle . Political counselor Osama al-Baz , who is normally the best channel to Mubarak , was in Tunis at the time , so Cairo relied on Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Megid , who proved an unsatisfactory conduit . The embassy does not have . the ' easy access to this Egyptian president that it had to Sadat . That estrangement may be attributable in part to the abrasive personality of Ambassador Nicholas A. Veliotes , whose call for Egypt to " prosecute those sons of bitches " ( overheard in a ship-to-shore telephone conversation with an aide ) made him a hero in America but touched off demands for his recall in Cairo . Mubarak and his aides had recognized that Egypt was . a low-priority concern in Washington after Jimmy Carter 's defeat in 1980 , but they had not anticipated that the Reagan Administration would consider the offended dignity of a friendly Arab country a small price to pay for the opportunity to bring terrorists to justice . In an interview with a local magazine , al-Baz teamed the interception of the Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any country , let alone one that we consider a friendly state with a principal role in the peace process . " He should have known better . Al-Baz , a graduate of Harvard Law School , has been Mubarak 's political mentor since the late 1970s , and is the architect of a strategy that is likely to lead to further tension with Washington unless the Administration shows more flexibility than it did during the Achille Lauro incident . Acting on the assumption that Sadat was destroyed partly because he was too pro-American , al-Baz , with Mubarak 's endorsement , is trying to restore at least the appearance of independence . " Egypt is not a part of NATO , not a part of the United States and not a part of the strategy of the West , " he told me a year ago . " Egypt 's purpose is to forge a strategy for the Arab world . That is why we can not accept any military bases here in Egypt . " He complained : " Some people in Washington that is , Congress want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that Egypt is a friend is not enough . " When Egypt 's privileged position as the second-largest recipient of American aid , after Israel , is in question , however , the leadership plays a different tune . A few weeks after my conversation with al-Baz the State Department received a confidential document from Cairo describing Egypt as a major " strategic asset " of the United States . The communiqu ? , which was drawn up to support a request for a $995 million increase in U.S. economic and military assistance in 1986 , cited the numerous times that Cairo had allowed U.S. forces to use Egyptian facilities to support operations , elsewhere , in the region , including Lebanon , the Sudan and Oman . While making the obligatory bows to nonalignment , " regional priorities " and full control over military bases , the document emphasized that " none of these problems will prevent steadily closer cooperation between Egypt and the U.S. " The Achille Lauro incident was only the most recent indication of the difficulties Egyptians face in staying in the good graces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regain acceptance in the Arab world . The American demand that Mubarak hand over the hijackers for trial forced the Egyptian leader to choose between placating the United States and breaking an agreement with the PaleStinians . Predictably , he received little help from either side . Washington was unsympathetic , and Yasir Arafat , who Mubarak said had agreed to ' take custody of the gunmen in Tunis , suddenly became unavailable . The decision to involve Arafat seems to have been an ill-conceived attempt to force him to act like a responsible international figure . Handing the hijackers over to the P.L.O . for trial and punishment , Mubarak explained , " would have proved to the whole world Arafat 's commitment to his statements condemning terrorism . " In late 1984 al-Baz apparently convinced Mubarak , who had previously avoided staking his prestige on diplomatic gambits , that Egypt could reconcile its American and Arab objectives only by leading an " " Arab initiative " to lure the United States back into an active role in Middle East diplomacy . Egyptian efforts contributed greatly to an apparent breakthrough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the P.L.O . and Jordan would " move together toward . . . a peaceful and just settlement of the Middle East crisis .. . do the basis of . . . United Nations and , Security Council ' resolutions . " From the Egyptian point of view that state , ment came close enough to the long-sought recognition of Israel 's right to exist to warrant Herculean American efforts to drag the Israelis to the bargaining table . Instead , the U.S. negotiators allowed themselves to be drawn into a bizarre wrangle over which Palestinians the Israelis would let them speak ' to - in preliminary talks . In the fall events took a turn that the Egyptians viewed with great alarm . President Reagan 's endorsement  --  later changed to mild disapproval  --  or the Israeli raid on P.L.O . headquarttrs near Tunis indicated that the Israelis were winning the Administration over to their view that the P.L.O . is purely a terrorist organization and as such deserves no place in future peace negotiations . The harsh U.S. stance on the Achille Lauro incident was further evidence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate that it has agreed to this plan to exclude the P.L.O . from any coming settlement , " said al-Baz in an interview published in Egypt on November 1 , " and we consider this adangerous mistake . " The Egyptians believe there is no alternative to working with Arafat . Like others in the Arab world , they are exasperated with him and have doubts about whether he still has enough clout to sell an agreement to his people , but they see no credible challenger to his leadership . The most revealing aspect of Egypt 's reaction to the Achille Lauro affair received little attention in the United States . Although the P.L.O . chief 's close associate Mohammed Abbas had planned the takeover of the Italian ship , the Egyptians invited Arafat to Cairo and gave him a hero 's welcome in November . On previous occasions the government had tightly restricted Arafat 's movements , but this time Mubarak permitted him to make a grand political tour , visiting the headquarters of the political parties , private homes , , the Islamic University al-Azhar and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . The government-controlled papers ran long interviews with Arafat . An AI Ahram headline , " Egypt 's stand is necessary to resist the Israeli and American plot against the Palestinian people , " sounded the main theme of the visit . Behind the scenes , however , Mubarak and al-Baz browbeat Arafat into pledging that future guerrilla operations would be confined to the " occupied territories . " In a telephones interview , Mohamed Sid-Ahmed , an Egyptian political analyst , drew two conclusions from the Egyptian regime 's royal treatment of Arafat . First , he said , " Mubarak can not afford to lose Arafat because he is his only window into the Arab world . " Second , hosting Arafat was " a way to stand up to the Americans after the humiliation suffered at their hands . " Mubarak was trying to tell the Americans , " You can not hit me as you have and assure stability in Egypt . I can not be ill treated in this way ; I can not afford to be identified only with the U.S. and Israel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the verge of a precipitous break with the United States and Israel analogous to Sadat 's surprise expulsion of Soviet advisers in 1972 . Al-Baz 's presence makes such an impulsive action unlikely . " He is very good at keeping things from getting out of control , " he said . Still , Sid-Ahmed considers the U.S.-sponsored , peace treaty with Israel to be in growing peril . He rightly pinpoints the continued resistance to the development of normal and neighborly relations with Israel as the chief cause of concern . The Egyptians are delighted to sell Israel about $400 million worth of oil each year , and they are keeping then embassy open in Tel Aviv . But they are discouraging nearly all other exchanges between the two countries . Israeli tourists visiting Egypt outnumber Egyptians going in the other direction by at least ten to one . There has been no Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv since 1982 , when Mubarak withdrew his emissary to protest the Israeli invasion of Lebanon . Although the Israelis have sent their best and brightest Arabists to Cairo in hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo elite refused to mix with them . An unpleisant expression of anti-Israeli sentiment oc-. curred on October 5 , just after the raid on Tunis , when a 24-year-old Egyptian border guard- opened fire on a party of bathing suit-clad Israeli tourists who approached his position near a beach in Sinai . Seven were killed , including two women and four children . Mubarak sought to minimize the killings as " a small accident " that was the work of a man " who lost his mind , " and Al Ahaly published an apparently scurrilous report that the tourists had provoked the young man by taunting him and spitting on an Egyptian flag . Another opposition paper , Al Shaab , reported that at his trial by military tribunal , from which the press was barred , the soldier told the court , " I do n't care if you execute me to please America and Israel . " To their credit the Israelig limited their response to this ugly incident to bitter complaints about the conduct of the local authorities , who , according to Israeli Health Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat casualties " and prevented Israeli medical personnel on hand from administering first aid . The Israelis also were careful not to hold Egypt responsible for the August attack in Cairo in which an employee of their embassy was killed and two others wounded by an unidentified gunman , who sprayed machine-gun fire through their car window . Sooner or later a similar incident could touch off a serious confrontation between the two countries . The stunted growth of Egyptian-Israeli relations is worrisome because little binds the two countries together beyond the special relationship both have with the United States and the ever-present threat that Israel will reoccupy the Sinai . Egypt 's ties to America are much more substantial than those to Israel , mostly becaiise of the massive economic and military assistance programs that U.S. administrations have mounted in Egypt since the 1973 war . Egypt is scheduled to receive $1.3 billion in military aid and $1.29 billion in economic aid in 1986 . Certainly the Egyptian leadership would be reluctant to provoke an aid cutoff , particularly at a time when its main sources of foreign exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America enormous leverage over Egyptian policy . Egyptian attitudes toward the aid programs have changed radically since the death of Sadat , in 1981 . They are no longer seen as a cornucopia of blessings but rather as small potatoes compared with what Israel receives and a sinister means of imposing American tutelage on Egypt . Some of the strongest supporters of the American connection are senior military officers , who do not wish to see their main source of arms jeopardized . Defense Minister AbdelHalim Abu Ghazala , a former military attach ? in Washington , quickly came to the defense of the United States after the Achille Lauro incident and was sharply criticized in Al Ahaly for putting his ties to America ahead of the national interest . The leftist paper also reported that Abu Ghazala pushed Mubarak into the disastrous decision to storm the Egyptair jet in Malta , over the objections of alBaz . Egypt 's loan repayments - to the United States have become a special source of friction between the two counl tries . With foreign exchange earnings in decline , Egypt is hard pressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Egypt is now in the form of grants , military pro , curement loans prior to 1984 carried interest rates as high as 15 percent . Principal and interest payments on these obligations in 1986 will be $557.3 million . Mubarak ' s repeated requests for relief have been spurned by Washington . The turndowns rankle for two reasons . First , the terms on Israel 's debt are continually being eased ; the latest rescheduling proposal could cost the U.S. treasury $531.7 million in 1986 . Second , the opposition uses the debt issue to support its contention that Egypt is following a pro-Western foreign policy because of economic blackmail . On September 18 , as Mubarak prepared to make his second pilgrimage of 1985 to Washington , Al Ahaly commented , " The West is exploiting Egypt 's rising debts to step up the pressure so that Egypt does not withdraw from its assigned role in the Western strategic framework . " To demonstrate his irritation with the United States , the Egyptian President has let the arrears on Egypt 's military debt to the United States build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have less to complain about if the economy was still expanding at the 8 percent clip of the late 1970s , but even that high growth turns out to have been illusory . It was fueled almost entirely by revenues from oil exports , Suez Canal tolls , Egyptians working abroad , tourism and foreign aid , all of which were vulnerable to forces beyond Egypt 's control , and which have either leveled off or gone into decline . Egypt benefited more from the Arab oil boom than most people realize , and it is feeling the effects of the bust more than some of the exporters in the Persian Gulf because it lacks their ample financial reserves . Lower oil prices have eroded petroleum export earnings from a peak of $2.8 billion in 1981 to $2.3 billion in 1984 . The money sent home by the approximately 3 million Egyptians working abroad has also been affected , since Saudi Arabia , Libya , Kuwait and other employers of expatriate labor have slashed their spending and forced as many as 500,000 Egyptian workers home . Mubarak must discover a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects at $1.3 billion for 1985 . That will not be an easy task . Word of Egypt 's problems is already beginning to affect its ability to borrow . For example , the British government 's export finance agency has dropped Egypt 's credit rating to the poorest-risk category .. In managing the domestic economy , the Egyptians play a game similar to the one they play in foreign affairs . Recent Egyptian governments have talked about self-sufficiency and independence , but in practice they have taken on as much debt and foreign aid as possible in order to avoid hard decisions . Sadat allowed imports to increase 20 percent annually during the fat years of the late 1970s , and in the four months prior to last year 's parliamentary elections Mubarak permitted a 30 percent jump in food imports to put his constituents in a good mood . Egypt spends about $5 billion per , year on subsidies that stimulate consumption and benefit the rich as well as the poor because the government has never bothered to limit distribution of subsidized items , such as 2 cent loaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean years are here Mubarak must deal with the consequences of past inaction . He has brought in his third Prime Minister in four years , Ali Lotfi , an economics professor , who is reputedly an austerity-minded budget cutter . The government is holding its first serious negotiations since 1978 with the International Monetary Fund , whose pressures for austerity are widely blamed for the riots that followed the increase in food prices in 1977 . In hopes of securing a $1.5 billion loan , Lotfi is promising to cut the subsidies and provide more incentives for foreign investment . There is no reason to think that pain will be any easier to sell in 1985 than it was in 1977 . Mubarak 's standing is no better - now than Sadat 's was then , and in 1977 there were no opposition newspapers to tell the masses that they were being asked to make sacrifices for the benefit of . the rich and Egypt 's American creditors . On the popular black market , the Egyptian pound , always a good barometer of the-nation 's mood , has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its all-time low against the dollar . Mubarak enters what promises to be the most trying period of his presidency in poor shape . Although few doubt either his honesty or his good intentions , his handling of both the Achille Lauro and the Egyptair hijacking have revived the old questions about his leadership . More troubling , he has yet to carve out a constituency for himself . Those who thrived under Sadat mistrust him , while the Nasserites and other leftists will never accept him until he completely repudiates Sadat 's policies . Even the military officers , who should be his most reliable supporters , are smarting from their bungling of the Malta raid and unproved charges that they leaked Mubarak 's plans for the Achille Lauro gunmen to the Americans . Barring economic and diplomatic miracles , Mubarak faces stepped-up pressure from the leftists , the liberals and the Islamic fundamentalists , who , although incapable of toppling him , are already making his job difficult . It is not hard to foresee a chaotic political atmosphere developing that might provoke an impulsive move by Mubarak or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
