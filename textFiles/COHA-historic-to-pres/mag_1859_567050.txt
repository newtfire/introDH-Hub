ARTICLE VIII. - NATURE AND THE SUPERNATURAL . Nature and the Sapernatural , a together con8t*tutinf/ the One Sy8tom of God . By HORACE BUSHNELL . New York : Charles Scribuer. 1858 . ThE author of this work is our associate in the conduct of this journal , and a friend to whom we are warmly attached . We should need no apology for being disposed to estimate favorably a work like this , because it was written by him . Our readers will expect us to express a cordial admiration for its excellencies , and to pass lightly over its defects . This book , however , stands in no need of commendation from the friends of the author . Indeed their testimony is likely to be little regarded ; it certainly will not be needed , in the general voice of grateful welcome with which it has been received , and the hearty response which has been rendered for its manifest excellencies by appreciating readers , if not by amazed critics , and hesitating reviewers . Even those who are still disposed to question the claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it in their hearts to question that he has rendered an important service to the Christian Faith . Or if this purpose lingers in their hearts , it falters upon their tongues , and they can not readily give it expression . To many , who care little for the name , but have sighed for the reality of an established Faith , it will prove a benison for which their hearts will ever bless the writer . We need only open the book and glance through its pages , to see that it is fitted to excite the interest with which it has been received . The style is in the main pure and even classical , certainly it is more exact and finished than in his previous writings , while it has not lost thereby one of its peculiar charms . His so-called affectations are now sobered to an antique quaintness which is well suited to the earnest convictions that throb in every sentence ; while the measured rhythm of his stately sentences remind us of the earlier and better days of // English writing , when strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copious English poured forth at their bidding , and wrought them into sentences that rushed along like a river in the spring time . The illustrations are sparkling , various , and expressive , ever declaring the power and peculiarities of the author 's genius . Single sentences , sometimes single lines , sum up and drive home an argument . They are not merely " battles , " but victories . We mark here and there a paragraph which rises into the sublimity of prayer , and the chant of praise . One or two chapters , we are sure , " the world will not willingly let die . " The most captions and ill-natured reader must feel the presence of genius , and acknowledge the genuineness of the inspiration . Even the unbelieving critic who is not convinced by the argument , can not help being lifted from his feet , and borne onward by the force and earnestness of the soul that has imparted such power to the movement of its thoughts . As we look more closely , we can see unmistakable indications that the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earnest thinking of years . The theme has long rested upon the author 's mind as one of commanding importance . He has appreciated , as but few men have done , the fatal and appalling progress which the Anti-christ of these days has been making for more than a score of years . The secret of its power he has studied and felt . He has discerned the subtle mniasm which has diffused itself so extensively into our literature , that has poisoned our philanthropy , and claimed almost exclusive possession of popular lectures-that has even infected our sermons , and wrought itself into our hymns and prayers . Should it be said that he has felt its power and been affected by ' its fascinations , we have only to re*1y , that it would be a shame to him if he had not , for not to feel its power would argue a stu-* pid and unthinking soul , the stuff fit to make a dogged bigot , or a pliant devotee . The believer in these days , who has no honest doubts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think . If he does not , but believes from the simple promptings of a trusting and loving heart , his lot is blessed , and his life is peace . But if he must find a reason for the faith that is in him , he must be blind not to see , and deaf not to hear , and ; // senseless not to feel , that the atmosphere is haunted by strange and bewitching spirits , that must be confronted and laid , or they will not " down . " If a man thinks that such a book is not needed in these times , and in this country , it is decisive proof that he does not think at all . If he says that the representations given by Dr. Bushnell of the extent and power of modern unbelief are overdrawn , what he says will only betray his ignorance of the currents of thought that possess the minds of myriads of decent Worshipers in churches , and reputable members of the community . The fact is , that these representations are not overdrawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquire how far this entire or half unbelief has taken possession of their own flocks , they might be surprised to discover , that while they have been preaching pointless sermons , or flourishing in ornate pulpit orations , the essay , the magazine , the lyceum lecture , and the rampant reformer , have been awakening subtle misgivings in the minds of the most gifted among their hearers . It is now some twenty-five years since the first beginnings of this influence . Those who watched its rise , and predicted the fatal result , were thought to disquiet themselves for a foolish dream . But the dream has become a reality . Dr. Bushnell was not merely qualified to meet this unbelief , by being aware of its existence , and by having watched its progress . He has sympathized with all that is plausible in the objections which he seeks to answer , and struggled with the doubts and difficulties which he would fain remove . Had he not thus sympathized and struggled , he were not qualified to furnish the remedy , for he would not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , the reasonings and the associations which exert so prevailing an influence over the men to whom he speaks , he could not gain the ear-much less could he speak to the heart of those for whom he writes . Indeed , not to have been affected by the pantheistic Naturalism of the present time , so far as to be pressed by its difficulties , and to struggle manfully and earnestly for deliverance , argues a nature inferior in native force , or in opportunities for culture ; it assuredly is a complete dis // qualification for the service of strengthening others , in " the good fight of faith . " Those mellifluous divines who ride smoothly on the buoyant waves of admiring congregations , those fervid evangelists , who gently or hotly stir the sensibilities of the crowd that pants for religious excitement , those positive dogmatists , who having never known a difficulty , or been disturbed by a doubt , anathematize all who , with manly earnestness and prayerful struggles , have felt after God if so be they might find him ; and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who love the church better than the truth-none of these men are fitted to speak words of sympathy or snccor to those who are tempted-for they can not understand them . Now it has been the great misfortune of our time , that the new infidelity has either been wholly overlooked in its subtle progress through our literature and criticism , or has been attacked , and confronted by those who have not understood time real force of its arguments , nor the feelings and prejudices of the men over whom these arguments have asserted so potent a sway . In England this unbelief has walked unnoticed and unrebuked through the middle classes , taking possession of ten8 of thousands of artisans , while the dissenters have been occmipied with their noisy brawls . Already it has begun , as it were , to nestle itself in some of the cloisters of Oxford , while sleek and lazy churchmen have been dozing in their stalls . It has spoken with unrebuked and arrogant impudence in the Westminster Review , and the defenders of the faith have been content to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote it out of book clubs and reading rooms . At last the author of " The Restoration of Belief " was stirred to a defense of the old historic faith ; but though he comprehended his antagonists in part , he did not so fully sympathize with their difficulties as to reach their understandings , *r touch their hearts . The able author of " The Eclipse of Faith " exposed their inconsistencies , ridiculed their pretensions , and satirized their folly , but he did not understand the men , nor their difficulties-he wrote like an advocate , and had an advocate 's reward ,  --  to secure the dislike , but not to gain the conviction of his opponents . // The learned author of " Perversion " produced a tale to meet the exigency . But he was so unjust to all unbelievers , as to ascribe their doubts to low appetites and debasing vice , and hence his work , though able in its argument , graphic in its portraitures , and often moving by its pathos , is fitted to offend , and for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to disgust the community whom it would defend against their influence . Other writers of acknowledged gifts have treated of single topics with eminent ability and entire success , except the most important success of making an impression upon their antagonists , through a manifest appreciation of their position and difficulties , and a cordial sympathy with their struggles . From Dr. Bushnell 's book we augur a different result . It will be read by those for whom it is intended . It will be respected as coming from a man of ability and genius . It will attract for the power and beauty of its style . More than all , it will be weighed by candid and considerate men , because it is written by one who understands and appreciates the difficulties with which they are environed , and is alive to the subtle influences and associations that have woven themselves into a net-work not easy to break . The new unbelief is preeminently philosophical and learned . It brings to the judgment and criticism of the supernatural and miraculous in Christianity , naturalistic and pantheistic assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bristling with a scholastic terminology , or glistening with the many colored hues of daring speculation . It applies to the disintegration of the historic record , a criticism that is laboriously erudite , and sometimes so learnedly wise as to lose sight of and forget all other wisdom . But in this country it is neither profoundly philosophical , nor laboriously learned . It takes the results of borrowed speculations , which it has not fathomed , and is imposed on by criticisms which it has not followed . But it is none the less dangerous for this . It is even more so , because it believes in results , rather than works out processes , and receives the dicta of favorite critics , without having the means , because it will not be at the pains of weighing their arguuments. // Dr. Bushnell 's book makes no pretension to technical philosophizing , and no parade of critical erudition . It is all the better that it does neither of these . It gives abundant proof of philosophical power , and what is better , of practical wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are in question , as they are held among us , without troubling himself with the source whence they are derived , or caring for the philosophical systems from which they have been received , and in which they are defended . These assumptions constitute the strength of the argument for his opponents . Upon these he bestows the entire force of his discussion , and briefly applies his conclusions to the confirmation of the historic truth of the Christian record . Having carried the argument on the first position , he has carried the second , for the critical argument against Christianity depends for all its strength and coherence upon its underlying theory of the supernatural . It first assumes , or attempts to prove that the miraculous is impossible , and impelled by the pressure of the necessity which it has thus taken upon itself , to find or make a construction or explanation for the evangelic history , it extorts the best that it can , and makes of it a distorted and monstrous impossibility . But when these assumptions are shown to be unnecessary and irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , and the critical difficulties vanish at a single glance of the eye . These remarks must suffice for our general observations upon this volume . As we scrutinize it from a nearer view , we open upon the author 's statement of the misgivings and unbelief in respect to Christianity which have been rapidly gaining influence in these times . Upon this we need make no critical remarks . This , with a brief exposition of the author 's design , fills the first chapter . In chapter second , he gives his definitions and opens the discussion . " Nature and the Supernatural , " are the conceptions which he seeks to expound in their sharp contrasts , and to harmonize in that concurrent action by which they constitute and complete the one system of God . The contrasts are not new . // They are as old as the history of speculation . Fate and Freewill-Matter and Mind-blind Force and intelligent ThoughtNecessity and Freedom-Atheism and Theism-Pantheism and the doctrine of a personal God ; these and other contrasted terms oppose each other in pairs along the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the eye can trace the marshaled hosts of contending thinkers . Even the terms applied by the author are not new . Coleridge says in his Aids to Reflection , ( Note 29 , ) " Whatever is comprised in the chain and mechanism of cause arid effect , of course necessitated , and having its necessity in some other thing , antecedent or concurrent-this is said to be Natural ; and the aggregate and system of all such things is NATURE . It is therefore a contradiction in terms to include in this the Free will , of which the verbal definition is-that which origimc*tes an act or state of being . In this sense therefore , which is the sense of St. Paul , and indeed of the New Testament throughout , spiritual and supernatural are synonymous . " Similar to these are the definitions of Dr. Bushnell . lie draws them out with greater minuteness indeed , and asserts for the supernatural the authority to interfere with nature , to control nature , to introduce disorder into nature and to recover nature from " the damage which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuate . " The spiritual realm , when considered by itself , " is much more properly called a system than the natural , because it is closer to God , higher in its consequences , and contains in itself the ends or final causes for which the other exists , and to which the other is made to be subservient . " This may serve as a brief exposition of the title , which is expanded into the discussions of the volume . We anticipate the following objections as likely to be made against these fundamental definitions . It will be urged that the conception he gives of nature , is not that which is accepted by the most enlightened students of the physical sciences , for nature in the view of such , can not be interpreted apart from her relations to spirit , in which indeed , all her gradations culminate as the bright conmmmate flower completes and crowns the plant . To spirit also , her processes // are subservient-even those which stretch backward through the ages  --  and which look forward to still more splendid developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention , or final cause ; in order to have intention , we must suppose an intelligent and free spirit-in other words , we can not have a correct and satisfying explanation of nature , without supposing intelligence and freedom . These suppositions are admitted in the prima philosophia  --  the necessary pre-suppositions of the most enlightened naturalists . Without these the powers of nature can not be evolved in subordination to one another , and be subjected to uniform laws . To this we might say , this representation is just . Were this not so , there could be no relation of the natural to the supernatural , of blind force to intelligent thought ; much less that subserviency which the one claims over the other . The question is not , what is the correct philosophy of the domain of nature , but what is that which in fact is taken by the great mass of the votaries of physical science . It may be conceded that many of the most eminent and large-minded physicists like Owen , Agassiz , and Dana , do in fact recognize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the tendency of such studies on the whole , is not to bind the mind to an almost exclusive consideration of necessity and unchanging law , giving no room to creation in the intellectual theory of the universe , except by the compliment of a naked acknowledgment of the original fiat  --  a miserable substitute for the living and personal God . Or if a live Creator be allowed to stand far back in the vista of remote ages , and to originate forces and impose laws , for the glory and entertainment of the philosophers of these last times , yet the possibility that he should break or renew the chain by another original act in creation or miracle , is not entertained . Much less does the savant trouble himself with the possibility that the originator nmust perpetually recreate in order to sustam-that to preserve is to renew-that he who started this mysterious chain whose links he counts in their order and whose magic strands he is ever twisting , must also send life along its circuit , or its organism would fall asunder . Definite // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builder begins . Fixed laws are presumed . But what these forces , and principles , and plans are , or what they imply in their relations to a power which is greater than them all , he does not care to inquire . But without prosecuting this particular question any further , we are certain that the views expressed by the writer in respect to the naturalistic theories , and the extent to which they prevail , are unquestionably true . The question is not , whether these views are the result of physical studies , or whether they do or do not furnish a foundation broad enough even for a physical philosophy . It is far wider and more fundamental . It is none other than whether matter and spirit , including both man and God , are not generally regarded and reasoned of as bound under inflexible law . Is it not the scientific faith of these days , that the actings of everything which exists are predetermined by the constitution with which it comes into being , and that for this constitution in its elements and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beings that went before ? According to this theory , science is the knowledge of existence and events in their causes and laws . In order that this knowledge may be possible and reliable , the causes must be uniform in their actings , and the laws inflexible in their requirements . Otherwise there were no certainty of human knowledge , and no principles in science . Spirit may differ from matter in its powers , and may obey different laws , but given the powers and their laws , and the result is as certain and as necessary in the one case as in the other . Hence the confident theories of civilization and of the philosophy of history , in which the development of the race is accounted for as satisfactorily as the development of a flower , and the stages of its progress are traced as distinctly to their causes , as the unfolding of the bud , or the ripening of the fruit . The same theory is applied to explain the phenomena of each individual soul . Its entire history , each thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nature and its circumstances . Sin is impossible . Holiness is scientifically absurd . Personal merit // and demerit are unscientific and nuphilosophical conceptions . There is no guilt to be repented of-no recovery to be sought for . Of course there is no possible occasion for the work of Christianity , which presupposes guilt , and has no meaning if guilt is not both possible and real . Miracles ! they are unscientific , they can be admitted by no sane man who is illuminated to know that the laws of nature can never be broken , and its processes can never be reversed or interrupted . God himself is engulphed in this all-absorbing vortex of scientific necessity . For God himself must obey the laws imposed by his own nature , and his nature is but another name for whatever is . The universe is the sole expression for the actings of God , and the actings of God in each passing instant are evolved from the actings of the moment before , and so will it ever be as we look forward into the future , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the past . It avails little , it avails nothing that we draw a line through this dreary waste , and seem to divide the dominion of spirit from that of matter . All is alike wrapt in icy fetters , and that which seems to put on the semblance of joy , and love , and goodness , is only the more dreary for its likeness to that which it mocks , like the fields , and forests , and flowers which the traveler sees wrought in the icy waste , or painted on the mirage of the desert . " Whatever is actual is rational , " 1 . e. , must be explicable by scientific law , and " whatever is rational is actual " - in other words , the forces of the universe will have their way . This is the maxim of one , the great master of modern thinking , before whose remorseless logic , God and man , matter and spirit , is resolved into the perpetual evolution of the necessary conception of each , while the conception and real existence of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares that science has only for its object whatever is positively known , and nothing is positively known which is not resolvable into facts expressed by mathematical relations-so that all the phenomena of matter and spirit are explained by blind forces grinding upon each other at a fixed rate , and with a uniform energy . Even this man charms not a few // devotees of knowledge , who are so occupied by the wealth of facts that he has mastered , and the lucid order in which he arrays them , that they fail to see in the theory itself-blank atheism grinning through the mask of a defective and povertystricken metaphysic . To all these forms of naturalism should be added another , which is clothed with imposing supernatural pretensions , and invested with high religious and theological authority . We mean the scheme of actual Pantheism , taught under the name of High Calvinism . If it is Pantheism to absorb God in nature , and to make God himself come to self-consciousness for the first time in the spirit of man , it is philosophically and as really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of sovereign grace . This is done by those who teach such views of God 's government as make sin and the consciousness of guilt as really impossible , as those who in terms deny it , who hold that sin is not only imputed when there is no law , but when there is no personal guilt , and who resolve the administration of electing and redeeming grace into the ultinua ratio of a sovereign who reigns , not by the authority of beneficent goodness , but by that of creative power . Though the scheme is taught in Christian pulpits , and proponuded from chairs of theology , it is exposed to all the philosophical objections which hold against the other schemes of naturalism , and to this in addition that it puts a horrid mask on the Christian faith . To all these existing forms of naturalism , Dr. Bushnell opposes his theory of the supernatural , as a system of powers or forces , higher in dignity and more important in its ends than the entire realm of natural agents with their powers and laws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , and real in fact . This being established , it follows that sin is possible and real , and that a miraculous redemption is not incredible . To these results tend all the philosophical discussions of the book . The real applications of the argument are the powerful chapters on the fact of sin , and Jesus himself a miracle . But how does he demonstrate that the supernatural is both // possible and real ? He plants himself on the fact that man himself is supernatural in a part of his being , i. e. his will ; that by this he truly originates-that though brought in close connection with nature , he is not subject to it but above itbringing to pass effects which the mechanism of nature never could have accomplished , and acting upon the lines of cause and effect already furnished . He is thus himself a new power  --  a superior force competent to effect results not provided for by nature acting alone . This is a fact which no one will deny-which , if he should , would be confuted by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies , superior in dignity , more comprehensive in their reach , and vastly more important in their results . These higher agencies , ruled over by the highest of all , constitute a supernatural system which is ever acting on this vast universe which we call natural , and producing striking effects in the interest of this higher system , and for its immeasurably superior ends . But this supernatural system and its actings is not a ghostly thing , but is to be conceived as ever present and ever acting along the chain of natural agencies . Here it will be asked on every quarter , Is this all the supernatural which he gives us  --  a supernatural like that of the personal will in man ? Does he not thereby degrade the supernatural to the natural , and instead of lifting the natural up , does he not bring the supernatural down-giving us the name  --  the empty shell , but destroying the reality-by casting the kernel away ? What avails it to contend for inspiration , if by this is meant that all are in8pired , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is intended is , that man acts supernaturally and works a miracle every time that he raises his arm ? We reply , this does notfollow necessarily , but everything depends upon the conception of the higher powers and agencies which the author gives us , and to which he leads us upward from the lower . To argue from the fact of the lower to the possibility of the higher , is surely pertinent and effective as a method of reasoning , for it silences objections and stifles misgivings . The only question to ask is , what the higher is to // which we are conducted . The use of the terms in the sense of Coleridge and Bushnell , if they are carefully defined , may be open to objection as departing from usage , but it has its advantages in arresting the attention to a truth too readily overlooked , as well as in fixing and recording the arguments which the terms thus employed will be sure to bring to mind . We shall consider in its place whether the author 's conception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying . But what of his theory of the supernatural in man ; is even that correct ? Has he truly stated the fact on which he founds these important inductions ? Do the phenomena of our own experience justify the representations which he makes ? Will not the very foundation of his theory fail , so that the whole superstructure must fall in ? In other words , it becomes a serious question , which in some quarters will be sharply contested , whether Dr. Bushnell 's views of human freedom-called by him the supernatural-are tenable . Of this question we observe , that the author does not profess to give a theory of freedom complete in its details , philosophically exact in its language , which is clear from all verbal inconsistencies and guarded against every possible objection . To do this was not necessary for his purpose ; nay , it might defeat this purpose , which was to state the fact of freedom in a way which would arrest attention , and to assert for it an element supernatural . This he has done in Chapter II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a fuller expansion in Chapter III , under the contrast between powers and things . In developing his views of freedom , he does indeed bring out its most important relations , and attempt to clear his doctrine from its most serious difficulties . He defends the fact and forcibly appeals to our experience and observation . He discusses its relation to motives or the natural element in the soul and the universe which environs it . lie faces the difficulties which grow out of the divine omnipotence , and gives a solution of this much vexed question , which is clear if it is not satisfactory . He enters the labyrinthine discussion concerning " foreknowledge absolute , " and gives his impression of the real clue that would conduct him through , while he does not linger // so long as to lose himself and bewilder his readers in its " wandering mazes . " Upon his position in respect to these relations of freedom , we have no criticisms to offer , for we think his views are just in the main , though they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired . One important oversight we notice , because it runs through the entire treatise and carries with it important consequences , both to his philosophy and theology . We refer to his conception of character , as determined or constituted by the actings of the will . These actings he makes to terminate directly and exclusively in the domain of nature , and there to leave all their influence . Thus the natural in the soul , the " memory , appetite , passion , attention , imagination , association , disposition , " are governed by their own laws in part , and in part subjected to the action of the will ; and whatever the will can do , is manifest in its effects upon these and other similar departments of the natural self . If its action were normal , it would bind nature to its s*rvice and find in her concurrent impulses , as well a security against a fall , as an inspiration to higher virtue . But if it is sinful , the will becomes the slave of nature , remaining indestructible indeed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn , but not competent to execute so as to realize its own ideals . These views run through the volume and are ever recurring in the explanations of sin and redemption . Dr. Bushnell expressly tells us that " volitions , taken by themselves , involve no capacity to regenerate , or constitute a character . Holy virt.ue is not an act , 01 : compilation of acts taken merely as voliti ons , but it is a new state or 8tcttue rather , a right disposedness , whence new action may flow . " pp. 239 , 240 . Compare pp. 51 , 52 , 53 . Of this we observe , it is true that volitions do not constitute the whole of character , when considered apart from what nature has provided in original endowments and dispositions-nor do they , irrespective of the forming influence which the volitions the actings of this supernatural agent called the will add to these original gifts of nature . It is as near nonsense to speak of the will as constituting the whole of a man 's character , as it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when the question is , what is the moral element in his character , or what in character has worth or the opposite , incurring praise or blame , we do not hesitate to say that it is his will . This Dr. Bushnell asserts broadly , boldly , and truly . But when he limits the acts of the will to single , transitive efforts that pass into the pliant chain of nature , he overlooks the fact that there are activities which remain and live on , not by their effects upon nature only , but as acts which are springs o living energy to the man himself ; that there are states and conditions not only of the intellect or of the sensibility , but states of the will itself , giving a sublime interest to those great decisions by which the act of the moment decides the character , and the decision of an hour becomes a living force for good and evil , which makes or mars the man , which blesses or curses his destiny . The fact is unquestioned in our psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation . It is true in other applications than the moral and religions . Had Dr. Bushnell not overlooked this fact , he would not have set the disposition or character in so sharp a contrast with the volition , and seemed to involve himself in a constant inconsistency with his main doctrine concerning the will . By so doing , he would also have relieved his doctrine of the will from grave objections . These objections are , that many , nay , the most of our volitions , seem to follow the disposition or character with the force of natural law that there is no moral element in them , except that which this character unparts . If therefore , the character itself is not directly dependent on the will , these so called acts of will are brought under the dominion of nature and obey the law of cause and effect . But let it be seen that in those most trivial acts , this voluntary , self-sustained , ever-renewed character , is manifested and expressed , and the difficulty vanishes , while justice is done to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature giving constancy and steadiness to our executive acts , and the element of the supernatural which holds us responsible for them all , because of the character which they embody and express . // We come next to the problem of existence as related to the fact of evil . A new set of questions here present themselves , and new issues are raised . The author begins by stating distinctly of the will orpower* in the universe , that " nothing in the nature of force is applicable to their immediate direction . " " Regarding them as properly first causes , " " they are not subject to any direct control or impulsion of omnipotence . " " The will , the man himself as a power , is manageable only in a moral way ; that is , by authority , truth , justice , beauty , that which supposes obligation or command . And this again , supposes a consenting ol ) ed ience , and this a power of non-consent , without which the consent were insignificant , which power of non-consent , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no one can show beforehand that , having such a power , the subject will not sometime use it . " ( p. 92 . ) With the question whether sin is to exist , Oninipotence has nothing to do . It can have no possible relation to it , except to create or not to create , the beings who are certain when created to sin . This is consistent with the great doctrine of his system , that the supernatural in man is supreme . He proceeds however , to suggest that " it may , for aught that appears , be the very plan itself of God to establish his powers in the right , by allowing them an experiment of the wrong , in which to school their liberty ; bringing them up again out of its bitterness by a delivering process , to shun it with an intelligent and forever fixed abhorrence afterward . " With these words he introduces an hypothesis that he expands at the effect that certainty to fall may be involved in the existence of every created " power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come through the experiment of the wrong . He protests that God desires no result of sinthat he is in no sense responsible for its occurrence , except so far as it grows out of the fact that such powers exist . He does not limit this hypothesis to man , but aph ) hies it , as he is bound to , with all boldness , to every order of created existence . lie finds the ground for it , not in any proclivity to slim implanted or imparted , but simply in the " conditions privative " Puder which the innocent but inexperienced must necessarily lie . // " Made organically perfect , set as full in God 's harmony as they can be in the mold of their constitution , surrounded by as many things as possible to allure them to ways of obedience and keep them from the seductions of sin , we shall discover still that , given the fact of their begun existence , and their trial as persons or powers , they are in a condition privative , that involves their certain lapse into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the positions are two-fold , being created as powers it is possible that they should sin ; being powers in a condition privative , it is certain that they all will sin . To the first there can be no objection , it follows from the conception of freedom , ex vi ter'nini , that to misuse it is possible , and so , also , it is possible that it may be used aright . Of the second , that " of powers in conditions privative , " it also may be certain that some will fall ; and it may be certain that others will not fall , and why ? because while there is a possibility of non-consent , there is a possibility of consent . But the " condition privative , " may involve the certainty that none will consent . True , and it may not . To say or to think that it must , is to pass out of the sphere of " freedom " into the sphere of necessity . It is to reason concerning the " supernatural " as though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the argument , from the high position which " powers " occupy by the dignity of their condition into the lower , which pertains to " things . " " But you forget the tendency in the privative conditions I " Not in the least ; but what is more to the purpose , we do not forget the prerogative of freedom . We set over against the allurements to sin the fact that these " powers " are not only gifted with supernatural " freedom , " but are also " made organically perfect , set as full in God 's harmony as they can be , " that so far as constitution is concerned , " apart from any character begun in action , " they are " organically ready , with all heavenly affinities in play , to break out in a perfect song . " We do not forget that Dr. Bnshnell expressly deprecates the inference , that a connection in the way of " natural consequence " exists between this privative condition and the certain lapse . We can not however , find any relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so confident an hypothesis . We concede and affirm the fact upon which the argument is founded , that to an innocent but untried being , temptation is necessary . It is necessary from the fact that lie is freenecessary , in order that having overcome it by a successful resistance , he may be girded with that strength and conscious security which comes only from the actual experience of the blessings of victory . But though temptation may be necessary in trial and moral discipline , it does not therefore give the necessity of a fall . It is one thing to believe that the secure in virtue owe their strength to conflict and trial , and quite another that they owe it to a purgatory . Nor do the three particulars into which Dr. Bushnell expands this " condition privative , " relieve the argument . And first , there is indeed a " necessary defect of knowledge and consequent weakness of a free person , or power , considered as having just begun to be . " He can not know indeed , the excellence of good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and df cursing , until he has proved them by actual experience . That he has in some sense the materials by which to anticipate both , we argue from the fact that he is under obligation to accept the one and avoid the other . Dr. Bushnell , in his theory of moral distinctions , finds no such necessity . And yet he argues that the lack of this experience , this empirical acquaintance with the sweetly bitter fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , is an element of weaknes8 50 etron** as to overcome all the categorical sacredness of conscience . We honor the sagacity that seems to be aware , that on his theory of virtue this is exalting " the 2rudential " excessively , more than we praise the success with which he escapes from this self involved difficulty , by making curiosity the fatal impulse that casts us down . As if curiosity must necessarily , or even certainly , be stronger than conscience . We acknowledge this necessary defect of knowledge , and that it arms temptation with a peculiar energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sz*pernatural. only that it is a defect necessary to temptation , and discipline , but that it does not bring with it a fatal fall . But secondly , it is urged that to the ti'aining of the soul for its establishment in virtue , two economies are essential , the first of law , which killeth , whose motives are prudential , and whose result is therefore selfishness ; the second , of liberating grace , whose atmosphere is inspiration , and whose victory is perfect freedom . We need not expand this argument-were we to do so , we should be forced to prolong our own strictures upon it . We dissent from this view not in every point , but in those aspects which are material to a sound and scriptural theology . We think it is inconsistent with the author 's own noble position , " that the man himself as a power , is manageable only in a moral way ; that is , by authority , truth , justice , beauty , that which supposes obligation or command , and this again , supposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not admit for a moment , that the motive from authority is prudential or mercenary . We could not so debase our conception of law-nor of Him who is " the Uncreated Power at the head of his immense family of powers , all systematized or sought to be systematized , all perfect in good , or else to be perfected under one law , viz : the eternal , necessary , immutable law of riaht  --  a law which he first of all accepts himself , in which his own character of beauty , and truth , and even his felicity is based , and which therefore he ordains for all , to be the condition of their character as of his own . " p. 89 . Nor do we think that Dr. Bushnell is supported by the analogies from the Scriptures by which he has manifestly been misled . The law which is there described as breeding a servile temper , is law acting on a fallen soul which it was impotent to redeem , not law given to an unfallen spirit . That in the soul already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouses all the devil of opposition , is true ; but that it tends to this in the spirit unfallen , we do not admit . The law in its influence upon the unperverted mind , is " ordained unto , " and therefore fitted to result in " life , " and it is only // the man whom it condemns , to whom it is " found to be unto death . " The analogies from the progress of discipline , through law to liberty in the family and the school , all fail , because they are transferred from the subject who is sinful already , to one who is as yet innocent . The tendencies of an agent differ greatly , according to the subject on which they act . The authority which was interpreted as love , and received as inspiration by the trusting and faithful Abdiel , was bondage and a bribe to the proud and self-relying Apollyon . The third of these conditions privative , is " the social relation of powers , and their trial in and through that relation . " Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all notice of Dr. Bushnell 's suggestions in respect to angelic beings , both good and bad . It is a curious fact , that Dr. Bushnell , when pushing another arguin ent , completely abandons his theory that a fall is necessary to all , in order to secure a confirmed virtue . " Furthermore , as corruption or deprivation is propagated , under well known laws of physiology , what are we to think but that a regenerate life may be also propagated , and that so the scripture truth of a sanctification from the womb may sometime cease to be a thing remarkable , and become a commonly expected fact ? " pp. 182 , 183 . The " Fact of Sin** is next discussed with an ability , an adaptive skill and a convincing energy , which we can not too ardently admire , nor too extravagantly praise . The chapter in which it is found , we regard as one of the ablest in the volume , and as sufficient of itself to give to it enduring worth and permanent fame . The " Consequences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows , to which succeeds another on " Anticipative Consequences . ' The consequences of sin in the soul itself in the body , in society , and in the material universe , are all depicted with graphic power , and often with startling energy . We have no room for quotations , but can not refrain from transcribing the following : // 244 Nature and the Supernatural . " And exactly this we shall see , if we look in upon its secret chambers and watch the motions of sins in the confused ferment they raise  --  the perceptions discolored , the judgments unable to hold their scales steadily because of the fierce gusts of passion , the thoughts huddling by in crowds of wild suggestion , the imagination haunted by ugly and disfigured shapes , the appetites contesting with reason , the senses victorious over faith , anger blowing the overheated fires of malice , low jealousies sulking in dark angles of the soul , and envies , baser still , hiding under the skin of its green-mantled pools-all the powers that should be strong in harmony , loosened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion ; the conscience meantime thundering wrathfully above and shooting down hot bolts of judgment , and the pallid fears hurrying wildly about with their brimstone torches-these are the motions of sins , the Tartarean landscape of the soul and its disorders , when self-government is gone and the constituent integrity is dissolved . " pp. 172 , 173 . So far as the argument in this chapter is concerned , we have only to suggest that it is somewhat over-stated , in that these disorders are not so entirely or exclusively to be traced to the originating force of the supernatural acting upon nature , as would appear at first view , or as we are eager to admit , after being appalled by the pictures of horror which he gathers about us , and borne swiftly on the rapid torrent of his powerful eloquence. lie says truly , that the possibility of mental disturbance , of bodily disease , and all kinds of misdirected action , are provided for within the ample range of nature 's laws , and so far these results are natural , but compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are unnatural . Some of these are directly the result of man 's own sin . Others ai-e armed thereby with increased energy . Many however , fall alike to the evil and the good , and can not be even indirectly ascribed to the new force of evil which has been brought into being by the will . In one aspect these disorders are penal . In an argument ad ho**ne* , to one who contends that sin is but one of the graver notes in the diapason of nature 's harmonies , and that in her song are 110 discords , it is lawful to assume that they are penal , and to use this assumption in the argument . But to one who asks why and to what end are these disorders which seem to defeat all the ends of nature , it were more satisfying to answer , that the most of them are designed to recover and // redeem . We wrong nature , we defeat her better ends . She reacts upon us with sorrow in body and soul , as well as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may save us from ourselves . In the dark aspects with which nature frowns upon us , she is reminding us of the evil of sin . Even death itself , though it holds us all our life-time in bondage , ever stands over us as a stern monitor , and impresses us with salutary lessons . It is not to punish , but to redeem , that we are doomed to live in a world so out of joint . One striking illustration of this is seen in this , that fearful as are the disorders to which we subject nature within and without us , we can not drive them beyond a certain limit , before they re-act and are forced to their own cure . Thus intemperance forces to abstinence , violence to law , the desolations of war to the necessity of peace . The healing tendencies of nature are worthily and fully noticed by Dr. Bushnell , but he has not so distinctly recognized that many of these so called penal disorders are in fact redeeming forces . We need not so much to be redeemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrows to be redeemed from ourselves . This leads us further to observe that the worst consequence of sin , that from which it is hardest to redeem man , is not emphasized by Dr. Bushnell as we could desire . We refer to that self-perpetuated , voluntary perverseness to which man cleaves , and which all the motives of habit , consistency , and pride , urge him never to relinquish . Sin is too much , with Dr. Bushnell , a bondage to nature , wrought by man himself indeed , but when contracted , requiring for deliverance another supernatural force . It is such a bondage indeed , but the saddest and the most hopeless feature is , that it involves also a bondage to a perverse and determined will . This is the proper 1 ) ondage of a supernatural power , and that he be brought to renounce this , requires the intervention of the higher supernatural in all the variety of its resources . In other words , his philosophy of sin is one-sided and ill-balanced . He does not view sin so much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural . lie illustrates // in his own case , the influence of those very naturalistic tendencies which it is the design of his book to oppose and turn aside . This will appear somewhat more strikingly in his theory of the remedy for these disorders . We pass over the chapter on the anticipative consequences of sin , with its striking truths and its manifold over-drawn analogies , and come in Chapter VIII , to " No remedy in development , or self-reformation . " Under this title two rival gospels are treated of , the gospel of development , or the natural progress of the race , and the gospel of restoration by a self-cultivated or self-originated virtue , dispensing with all supernatural aids . In the treatment of the first , we find little to amend , in that of the second we agree entirely with the author 's meaning , but think the language not entirely consistent with his leading position concerning the autonomy of the will . But this grows out of the oversight already noticed , in respect to the state of the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the wilifalnees with which this is adhered to , when once it is made . Self-recovery and self-development are eminently hopeless , because of this willfnlness , and to overcome it , even when all the forces of religious truth are brought into requisition , is the reason of all others why supernatural interference is required . We do not deny that it must also interpose to restore the natural disorder which the will has occasioned , but still to bring the influence upon man which shall lead him to avail himself of these supernatural appliances , is its final and most glorious achievement . But we pass to Chapter IX , which opens to us the question which has been so much vexed in these last days , viz , whether the Supernatural in its highest sense , is compatible with Nature , and is subject to fixed laws . In other words , is not the belief in the miraculous , an offense against our faith in that order of the universe which is both the fret axiom and the final demonstration of all science ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply , viz , the belief in the miraculous is unscientific and absurd . The Pantheist* makes it , * Strauss takes this position , for to him nature is God , and God is nature . The difference that he makes between the immediate action of God and his mediate // who carries his notion of vigorous law with its necessitating force far , to subject to it either the beino ' or the actings so as of God himself . **31;33;TOOLONG , like Emerson , and those who affect his dialect , and are infected by his conceptions , do the same . Physical philosophers of all classes , who are occupied exclusively with the inflexible and comprehensive power of the laws of nature , and little accustomed to recognize the ends of nature as superior to her laws , take the same position . So do all those social and political philosophers , who , for the sake of making history a science , sacrifice to the Moloch of law all that gives history its dignity , i. e. , the freedom and responsibility of man . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , men who live in club houses , and criticize art , and study society , but have no earnest purpose in life , who will scarcely condescend to love , much less to religion. * With all these classes however , the belief in law , whether it is a principle or a prejudice , is a fact , and needs to be satisfied . Their objections to any supernatural interposition are two-fold , according to Dr. Bushnell . First , that such interference is incompatihle with the order of nature . Secondly , that this agency is dispensed without law , and contrary to reason . In opposition to the first , he undertakes to show that such agency is compatible with nature , and that even miracles do not imply any removal , or suspension of her laws . God 's acting upon nature may as truly be his acting upon the lines of nature , as is the action of man , when he gives new directions , and makes new comhinations , by the supernatural force of his will . Only the directions and combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those at the behest of man . action , to which Dr. Bushnell refers , and against which he argues , is to be interpreted in accordance with the logical pantheism of the Hegelian school , which excludes , when rigidly applied , the possibility of freedom , of sin , of the miraculous , and of a personal or supernatural God . There is no arguing with such men , except against their philosophical scheme . Still another class of like Parker , believe in God * men , who . , and to a certain extent in sin , being too sturdy and earnest in their nature to disown a personal God , too fond of personal independence to be willing to be engulfed in the pantheistic vortex , and too sensitively alive to real life , to be ignorant that sin is a fact-admit the possibility of miracles , but deny their reality . // We submit that in thus limiting the supernatural actings of God , he departs from his own principle , which is to exalt the supernatural . Who is the truly supernatural in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her uniformities and laws ? Not only has he called them into being by his creating fiat , but by his preserving word he holds them in being eve ryinstant , renewing the currents of life , and renewing also the channels of life in which they are to run . Shall we say that he can not suspend or reverse these laws ? That were to limit the range and sphere of his supernatural power . It were to yield a claim to nature which she has no right to assert . Will he ? Does he ? These are other questions , but that he can , who that believes in the supernatural will venture to deny ? This admission is not supported by the illustrations to which he appeals . " That nature is in fact submitted to his action , as to ours , in the manner supp osed , is evident from the report of science itself . For when the geologists show that new races of animal and vegetable life have taken a beginning , at successive points in the history of the creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be succeeded by others fresh from the hand of God , what does it signify , but that the atoms and elemental forces of nature are so related to God , that they do , by their own laws , submit themselves to his will flowing into new combinations , and composing thus new germs of life ? " pp. 254 , 255 . Surely Dr. Bushnell can not have reflected upon the import of his words , when for these phenomena he denies creative origination , and contends that it is only by laws and forces already in beincr that " of life were composed . " In new germs taking this position he seems to us to abandon all that he has asserted , and to throw himself , with all his artillery , into the camp of the naturalists . Again , it is inconsistent with all his reasoning concerning the uses of nature , as not of itself created for any final end , but only to serve the ends and uses of the supernatural . We would that we could transfer to our pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her true position in the universe of God . They are only marred by the assertion that nature must be a constant quantity , else we could not trust her , nor learn to control her , a remark which is neutralized and swallowed up by the force of the very argument in which it occurs . // For the ordinary ends of the supernatural , nature must indeed be constant , but for its extraordinary ends , her constancy must give way to a superior power . We say " if these ends require it . " It will not settle the question to say , " if nature were to be violated and tossed about by capricions overturnings of her laws , there would be an end of all confidence and exact intelligence . " This is true . Where confidence and exact intelligence would be infringed , there are no overturnings , but when higher ends than these come in , the " overturnings , " if it be right to call them such , are at least not " capricious . " But all that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , under his second head , in which he shows that the supernatural agency of God is itself subject to law and system . Indeed his exposition of this position , quite supersedes and refutes those to which we have excepted , and gives the true ground of defending the supernatural against objections of every kind . It is here that he plants his foot strongly on the principles furnished by the grand truth of his book , that nature does not constitute the whole of the system of God-nor is she even coordinate in rank and authority with the supernatural , but that the ends of the last give law to the first . These only furnish the true principles by which the order of each part , and of both together , can be and is regulated , and by which alone it ought to be interpreted . In unfolding this view for the object beibre him , he brings out the fact that neither natural nor moral law exhaust our conception of the laws that are possible , but that there is a third law which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one 's end , or the law which one 's reason imposes in the way of attaining his end . " Whenever the ends of God impose the necessity that supernatural agency should step in , it is according to system and rational order that it should-that system and rational order by which the supernatural subjects nature to its purposes . Inasmuch as God is a rational being , he acts in all such cases acccording to system . Inasmuch as his forecast is perfect , he has framed his plan of working so as to include such interpositions . Now we contend , that even if such intervention amounts to a suspension of the laws of nature , ( meaning thereby lower or physical nature , ) there is no real disorder , // but in this very suspension a more striking example of order itself  --  the order which requires that appropriate means should be used to accomplish the highest of all ends . To assume that in doing this , it may not be necessary that these laws should be suspended , or that " Nature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws themselves , which laws he has never to suspend but only to employ , having the great realm of nature flexible as a hand , " is to assert more than we know , and to fall back into those ways of thinking and speaking which should have been exorcised once and forever . But it will be still urged that we must believe that even in these supernatural workings , God only avails himself of one or more of an unsearched variety of hidden laws which he only can command . We reply , that whether he does or not , will depend entirely upon the ends which he proposes to accomplish . If he desires to break in upon the view of an atheistic universe by creating a new world , it may be needful to do it in other methods than by subjecting one set of laws to another , in the way that the vital forces overcome and manipulate the chemical , and the chemical the mechanical , because his very object- " the rule of universal application in all such cases " - may require something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to life by the word " Lazarmis come forth , " the end which " in this case is the law to God 's working , " may require that the work of nature in decomposition should be arrested , i. e. , suspended , and a force unknown to nature come in and recompose those disintegrated particles under the workings of a new vital energy . Any other interference than this , may fail to attain the end-which is to startle and surprise , as well as to demonstrate the power of the Almighty to those who cry out , " This is the finger of God . " We have lingered so long upon this point , and have expressed our views so fully , that we scarcely need notice the chapter formally devoted to the miracles wrought by Christ . We assent to the definition of a miracle given by the author , except that it is not theologically complete . So far as it goes it involves no error . Upon some of the negatives affirmed , we will make a passing remark . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a wonderful event developed under the laws of nature , and , ( 2 , ) that a miracle is no event that transpires singly or apart from system . lie asserts , ( 3 , ) that " a miracle is no contradiction of our experience , and is only an event that exceeds the reach of our experience . " This seems to be a verbal criticism . In the sense intended by Hume , it is a contradiction of our experience , i. e. , our experience of merely natural phenomen a . This makes it a miracle . Our error is , that we exalt our uncontradicted experience in this inferior realm , into a law for the realm which is higher , and refuse thus to make our belief of what is possible in the future , hold in check our uncontradicted experience of the past . As a rule of j ndgment , I-fume 's criterion was correct , and applies to all those cases in which supernatural intei'ference is not justified to our reason , by an occasion or end that accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 , ) that " a miracle is no suspension , or violation of the laws of nature . " Upon this point we need add little to what has been said . We have contended that there is properly a suspension of these laws , and not a mere subordination of them to the flexible hand of the All-powerful , and the more sagacious mind of the All-knowing . That this suspension of these laws involves no disturbance of the harmonious workings of nature , nor any violation of her peace , we need not argue . It is not a suspension of the law , as a law , but a suspension of the application of it to a single case , in which very case the maxim holds good , ececeptio probat regulam . The law itself is not abrogated , nor is a general license granted to awaken our distrust , but the supernatural power that holds the law in its hand stays it in its operatidn . We do not say that this is true of all the miracles recorded in the scriptures , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied , but we do assert , that on the grounds furnished by Dr. Bushnell himself ; there is no philosophical objection against their possibility. * * Thus writes Dr. Rothe , one of the most distinguished of living theologians : " Here must I face the question , how I dispose of the grave difficulties which seem to be involved in the very conception of a miracle . In respect to this question I find myself somewhat embarrassed . Not however , by the solution of // We do not , because we can not , give the forcible and eloquent argument that is presented on the question of fact , " did Christ work miracles ? " It is an argument which can not be described : To be appreciated , it must be read , and being read , especially in the connection in which it occurs , it must leave a strong impression , if not a firm conviction , on every truthloving mind . In answering the objections against miracles , Dr. Bushnell encounters the following : " If miracles are credible in the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible . " He thus rejoins : " To this we answer , that they are now always credible . But it does not follow that they now and always are fact . That must depend upon historic evidence . " This answer he follows by several considerations which on the whole are wise and just . We are surprised that he did not leave the subject here , but that as by an after-thought he added Chapter XIY , entitled " Miracles and Spiritual Gifts not discontinued . " In this , with confessed misgivings and with some very pungent remarks against the perversion to which the fact and the faith in it would expose the church , he contends that miracles have occurred in all ages , and recites not a few ancient and modern instances . We contend as earnestly as Dr. Bushnell that miracles in these days are credible , i. e. , possible ; rather , the fact that they can occur is credible . There is no hindrance to the divine power in this matter . Neither the theories of science , nor the associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have straitened the divine resources , nor interposed any medium between God and nature , so that he can not at any the difficulties , but because I do not see that any difficulties exist . I will in all simplicity out with my honest confession , that to this hour I have never been able to make it clear to myself how my rational nature could possibly take offense at the conception of a miracle . It may arise from this , that I am so thoroughly a theist in my nature , that I never could find in myself the least trace of deistic or pantheistic feelings . In part it may arise from the fact , that as a matter of prin ciple I have ever held these two questions distinctly apart , the simply abstract inquiry , whether a miracle in itself is rationally conceivable , and the concrete , whether , in a given case , a reported miracle , even if it be in the Bible , is to be received as having occurred in fact . " Studien und Kritiken. 1858. pp. 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her circuits , or by breaking her connections . But the fact that a miracle does occur is only credible when it is proved by decisive or sufficient evidence . Miracles are shown to be possible for another reason ; God may as truly bend or break the course of nature in spiritual or invisible acts as by miracles proper . He may answer prayer by healing the sick , or by reclaiming the soul , or in other ways interpose in extra-natural acts of divine agency ; for in human inspiration , support , or sympathy , there may be as real a departure from the strictly natural , as though a miracle were indisputably manifest to the mind through the senses . But when it is asserted that miracles proper do occur , meaning thereby " a sign to the senses " of superhuman power , we question the fact , because we distrust the evidence . In those acts of which we speak as of answers to prayer , of comfort , &amp;c. , there may be an exertion of supernatural power , but " there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why do you distrust the evidence ? Because in all these cases there is no decisive proof , we may say , no proof at all , in support of the essential fact to be proved , i. e. , that " there is a sign to the senses . " The event may be very wonderful , the individual or his friend may be satisfied that in its occurrence there is the " great power of God , " but there is no circumstance that decides that they may not be deceived . No man can say that the best attested facts , as the story of Mr. Yount of California , may not have been brought to pass by some extraordinary conduct of the laws of nature . The very difference between these striking occurrences and miracles proper , is stated by Dr. Bushnell himself , and this enables us to draw a broad and distinct line between these events and those wonders recorded in the scriptures , which deserve , in the highest sense of the term , to be called miracles . Again , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases of recovery from bodily infirmity , the subjective force of a strong faith in God , of itself gives intensity to the vital energies that would otherwise falter and fail in the struggle between life and death-that the imagination may be excited to see a " miracle , " when God only works a " wonder "  --  and that // this very persuasion in turn gives new confidence to faith and new energy to action , and that the faith in , and imagination of , the miraculous , thus excited , are potent uatural forces , which are acknowledged in common speech , to work miracles of healing and of heroism . That God 's hand may be in such events we do not deny ,  --  and that God at such times brings into play more than is usual of the common agencies of nature , and vivifies them with an iutense energy , we will not dispute , but that God works a miracle , is , to say the least , " not proven . " We urge also , that miracles are not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the criterion already considered , that miracles are to be expected when an occasion requires them , or when the ends of the supernatural require an invasion of the accustomed order . To this it will be suggested , that it is presumptuous for man to judge , and hard to prove that such occasions do not exist . We reply , it is no more presumptuous than it is for man to judge that they do . When Dr. Bushnell or others urge that such occasions do arise from time to time in the history of the church , that she may be aroused from her atheistic doubt and sloth , we reply , that these circumstances are not to be compared with those which attended the advent of Jesus , and the first setting up of his kingdom . To say or to think this , is to forget the fearful odds against which that kingdom contended  --  the savage tenacity with which all the powers of earth and hell held fast to their strong-holds , and the fanatic rage with which they sallied forth to swallow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes . Nay , it is to forget the person of Jesus himself , and the splendid argument in which Dr. Bushnell conducts us to the conclusion , that miracles of sense were fitly to be looked for in connection with a being so wonderful . There is now no necessity so stringent as in those early times , nor is there a personage so wonderful . The history of Christianity is itself more wonderful to the right-minded inquirer , than the raising of Lazarus from the dead , and the power of a consistent and fervent Christian life a mightier agency for the propagation of the gospel , than the tongues of fire on the day of Pentecost . It ' the church betrays her trust , or a generation // relapses into atheistic or scoffing unbelief , God can awaken both by judgments , such as those which he poured over Europe in floods of fire , in the days of Napoleon . We do not then expect miracles , because we know that we do not need them , inasmuch as we are untrue to those wonders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is by the conviction of these truths that we justify and explain the sentiment of the Christian church , which is so decided and so strong again st their recurrence . Another reason why we do not and ought not to expect the return of these supernatural gifts is , hat if given often they would lose their power , and would be abused to the service of gossiping and vanity . The sweetest things are most easily soured , the best things are the soonest corrupted , and the most sacred things are the most readily profaned to common and perverted uses . As Dr. Bushnell phrases it , miracles and gifts tend to issue into " a wild Corinthianism . " Even the wonders which we do behold , we can scarcely bear with a reverential composure . Our wonders of healing and of grace given in answer to prayer , are retailed with a gossiping vulgarity . Our revivals evaporate in story telling and censoriousness , are distracted by sectarian acrimony , or become the disgust of the right-minded , through the clap-trap with which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles if we had them ? The wonders which the church beholds , either pall upon her sense , or turn her sobriety into giddiness . Then the faithful and worshiping who believe in God 's ever active grace , find his ordinary ways full of wonder , and see occasions for no workings more extraordinary than those which they witness day by day . The men of other days , who needed miracles to arouse their besotted senses , could bear them when they came , but stimulants so potent as these would be sure to disturb our more sensitive natures . It is true that our faith may be very weak in these days . We are sure that our heads are not over strong . For these reasons we do not find reason to expect triiracles . For the same reason we are cautions and distrustful when they are reported to occur , by very honest and credible men . // There was as much wisdom as wit in the answer of Coleridge to a lady who asked him , " iDo you believe in ghosts ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " These events or occurrences that are put forth as undoubted miracles , do not come up to the criterion . They are not signs to the senses . Some of them are wonderful . Not a few are as surprising and interesting-nay , we think more so-as if they were the manifest workings of a supernatural power . They are workings of the same power that works miracles whenever miracles are wanted . Some of them are to be accounted for by natural agencies . Others , and not a few , are slightly altered in the recital . Others are more than slightly intensified in the coloring . Others we may not be able to explain . But as we have had no opportunity to discriminate and judge , we are content not to ftirnish a solution . Only we are quite certain that we are not bound to declare them undoubted miracles . Meanwhile if miracles are wrought or shall be wrought in these times , we stand ready to believe them , when they are proven  --  but not before . We honor the earnestness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject . We accept the suggestions of wisdom with which he has qualified them , but would rather pray for faith to do justice to the wonders which we see , than ask for others which might shock us by their novelty or inflate us with religious vanity . At the same time , we would rather believe with Dr. Bushnell , than scorn with Yoltaire , or serenely but coldly smile with Emerson . We would sooner bow and tremble before a manifested God at the elevation of the Host , than , with the Pantheist , own no God , but the actual universe , or its irnpalpable conception with its abstract relations . We would sooner hear and believe in the modern gift of tongues than be marshaled through the proprieties of a fashionable congregation . Nay , we would soooner shout in a camp-meeting , than freeze in a rationalistic chapel . We have omitted all notice of three chapters of this book : the tenth , twelfth , and thirteenth . The tenth is by far the ablest and the most interesting in the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our view , the finest upon its theme // in English literature . To have written this chapter in the circumstances and for the object for which it was done , is honor enough for a single life . It is skillful , just , eloquent , and warm , with ardent reverence for its wondrous theme . That Dr. Bushnell has witnessed a confession so good of his faith in Jesus , before those who are so ready to dishonor his claims , and in words and thoughts so worthy of his theme , will be the brightest crown of his glory , when he shall see Him as he is , and which , we doubt not , he will be ready to cast before the throne of Him when He shall be " admired of all them that believe . We trust it will lead many of the ingenuous and thoughtful youth of this generation to renounce their be wilderment and fantastic distrust , and to make the same open-hearted confession , to be followed by a life animated and sustained by a living faith in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the system of Christian faith from Christ as its center and starting-point , which with some want of clearness and fullness in its theory of justification by his death will be owned to be a scriptural and living presentation of Christian truth . The thirteenth gives us the elements of the philosophy of history , in which Christ takes his lawful place , as the beginning and object of all the purposes of God . The last chapter gathers and applies the results of the discussions to various uses of truth and the life , in which the defects and excellencies of the entire argument of course reappear . Most of these defects may be comprehended in the single statement , that the author has deferred too much to the Nature from which be has sought to escape . He has not always , in our view , sufficiently honored the supernatural , but has lowered it too nearly to the conception of the natural . The roots and principle of character he has found too much in the nature of the soul , and too little in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too exclusively limited to the evil which the will has wrought in nature , and not preeminently in the evil will . The supernatural is needed for redemption , chiefly to bring a power above nature to heal her disease , rather than to subdue and constrain the perverse and unbending man // 258 Nature and the Saperncttural . The miraculous is confined and imprisoned within the limits of nature , in too subservient an homage to those laws whose supremacy is elsewhere so nobly subjected to the creative spirit and his superior ends . But though the book bristled as thickly as a porcupine with defects like these , or with greater heresies , we should not hesitate to pronounce it a magnificent book . It so nobly redeems the free spirit from the shackles to which it has been subjected by prevailing assumptions , it so heroically exalts the soul above its bodily investiture , and the unseen Spirit above the garment of nature which He wears , though that garment be the glorious light ; it so heroically addresses itselt to exorcise the spell that has bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation ; it furnishes such ample materials for a successful argument for the miraculous ; it has so skillfully and powerfully demonstrated the fact of sin , so impressively illustrated its helplessness and degradation , and above all , it has so demonstratively and so cordially vindicated the claims of Him who " came unto his own and his own received him not , " that we do not hesitate to commend it as a truly Christian book , and a book pre-iminently adapted to the times in which we live .
