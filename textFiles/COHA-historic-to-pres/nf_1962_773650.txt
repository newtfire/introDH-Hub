 this case , the general natural law would be : " . . . in cases A , B , C . . . energy is conserved , in cases D , E , F . . . it is not in the following way . . . . " Entropy All processes that take place around us and in us are , strictly speaking , irreversible . True time can not , like a film , be run backwards . The laws of mechanics do not express this irreversibility . For instance , the exact reversal of the motion of a planet or of an undamped vibration is , according to mechanics , again a possible motion of the planet or a possible vibration . Neither does any true law of conservation , such as the law of the conservation of energy , involve a direction in time . It has been shown that even the basic laws of the electro-magnetic field and of atomic physics do not involve irreversibility of time . This property of true , historical time is expressed only in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermodynamics . If we pour cold water into hot , both temperatures become equal , without any work being done . This process can not be reversed in any way without expending some external energy , or without making some changes in the environment which , in their turn , are irreversible . A body in motion can be brought to rest through friction . If , however a body at rest is warmed with the heat thus liberated , this does not immediately put it into motion . We can say that although work can generally be completely changed into heat , heat can not be completely changed into work . Differences of temperature may be used for doing work ; as is done for instance , in the steam engine . However , the quantity of heat found at the lowest working temperature can not be changed into work . Otherwise we could build a machine that gains energy , by simply cooling the ocean . This second law can be formulated as the law of the impossibility of a " perpetuum mobile of the second kind " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heat reservoir , without anything else permanently changing in the world . The mathematical formulation of this law leads to the definition of a new magnitude , entropy ( Greek ? " turned within " ) , which may be taken as a measure of the energy // lost in the form of heat and not available for work . The existence of irreversible processes is expressed in the fact that the entropy of a system isolated from its environment can only remain constant or increase during any physical processes within this system , and that it can never decrease . A process in which the entropy remains constant is reversible , one in which it increases is not . Very strictly speaking , there is no process in the world which is reversible , for there is always a slight increase in entropy . Chapter 6 THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HEAT AND ATOMISM WHAT we have considered up to now is " phenomenological thermodynamics " . In it are derived the connections between pressure , volume , temperature , energy , entropy , etc. , without trying to refer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes . Many facts , however , become much clearer if we assume that heat is a disordered motion of atoms . The Kinetic Theory of Gases At first this leads to a simple interpretation of aggregate states . In the solid state , the atoms are held in fixed positions by their mutual forces ; it is for this reason that the body as a whole retains its shape . In the fluid state , the thermal motion of the atoms is greater . It is true that the forces still keep them attached to one another , but they move past each other much as do people in a crowd ; and thus liquids can take on any shape . In a gas the atoms are spread far apart or , at best , they remain united in smaller groups , the molecules . Every gas molecule flies freely through space until it meets another molecule or a wall of the container . Here it is strongly deflected for an instant , and then again follows its inertial path until the next collision . This model explains the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each molecule . The pressure which the gas exerts on the wall is due to the continuous collisions of the molecules with the wall . Each square centimetre of the wall at room temperature and at normal atmospheric pressure is hit by approximately 2.1 o23 molecules per second , each of which although it only weighs 5 . I 0 23 gm nevertheless collides with an average velocity of approximately half a kilometre per second . If , at constant volume , we increase the temperature , both the number of collisions , and also the change of momentum at each single collision , will always be increased proportionately to the average velocity of each molecule . Thus the velocity of the molecule must be considered twice , and the pressure exerted , therefore , is proportional to the square of the velocity , i.e. to the kinetic energy , and thus to temperature . If 52 // we enclose one and the same mass of gas at the same temperature , first into a volume of one litre , and then into two litres , then because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first case and therefore the pressure will be doubled . The absolute zero point is now shown to be the limiting temperature at which molecules will have no movement . It will be obvious that the concept of further cooling is nonsense ; there is no lesser motion than rest itself . But it will also be obvious that matter when it approximates this condition , will cease to be gaseous . The atoms will then hardly move at all and will only occupy a small space , touch one another , stick to one another , and form a liquid or a solid . The kinetic theory of gases ( Greek : KGVVTG3 =movement ) can further explain conduction of heat , diffusion and the viscosity of gases . It tells us not only the average energy of the molecules but also how the velocities of the molecules deviate from the mean ( Maxwell 's velocity distribution ) . The kinetic interpretation of the second law ( Boltzmann 's H-theorem ) is better discussedindependently of the special case of the idealgas . General Statistics In the kinetic theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the molecules . The energy of every single molecule can never be known to us , since two grams of hydrogen ( at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of o ? C in 22.4 litres ) contains 6.1023 molecules ( Loschmidt 's or Avogadro 's number ) . The kinetic theory of gases is therefore essentially a statistical theory . With it , probability has become an important concept in physics . The statistical character of the theory rests not only on the great number of molecules , but also on the fact that heat is a disordered motion of molecules . Let us remember what we said above ( pages 40 ? 41 ) about the concept of disorder in dealing with turbulence . Historically , the concepts discussed there were first used in the kinetic theory of gases and in the general statistical theory of heat , and only in the last fifteen years have they been applied to turbulence ( by G. I. Taylor and others ) . Here we shall take up these ideas in a form suited to the theory of heat . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different forms of motion , the differences of which we can not or do not want to investigate for each single case . In a given mass of gas only the thermo-dynamic magnitudes of its states such as pressure , volume , and temperature , can be easily observed . The latter , however , characterise the condition of the molecules only very summarily . Let us consider two equal volumes of gas at equal pressure and at equal temperature . In the two cases the two sets of individual molecules can easily execute quite different motions . Thus two gases seen macroscopically ( i.e. observed with the usual large scale laboratory equipment ) can be in the same condition ; we say that they are in the same macro-state ( ? aKpos =great ) . Equally , " microscopic " observation of all molecular movements would reveal quite different micro-states , which agree only in the average energy of the molecules and some similar " macro-magnitudes " . If we knew the micro-state , this would naturally also give us the macro-state . Every microstate , therefore , belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong very different possible microstates . The usefulness of these concepts is shown in the statistical interpretation of the second law ( Boltzmann ) . It seems paradoxical that a law , which propounds the irreversibility of thermal events in general , should be derived from a theory which refers heat to the motion of atoms and then applies the concepts of mechanics to these motions . On page 50 we observed that neither classical mechanics nor modern atomic mechanics involves the irreversibility of time . For the sake of simplicity , we shall here stick to classical mechanics , which was all that Boltzmann had at his disposal . According to the equations of mechanics , every possible motion of the atoms could take place equally well in the reverse way . Now if heat is motion of atoms , why then should not each thermal process be able to run in reverse ? It seems as though the kinetic interpretation of heat contradicted the second law directly . In reality , irreversibility is not introduced into the kinetic theory of heat by mechanics , but by statistics . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time which , it is true , is only introduced into the usual representation of this theory in a very veiled manner . We may emphasise this by // saying that : probability is a quantitative interpretation ( and a narrowing ) of the concept of possibility . " It is possible that with the next throw of this die we shall throw a six . " This is a relevant statement , but it can be made more precise as follows : A six will fall with the probability 1/6 . Statements of probability about actual events , just like other predictions derived from natural laws , can be tested empirically . Ex hypothesi , however , they can not be tested in a unique case , but only in an aggregate of cases , a " collective " . A statement of probability is empirically tested as a statement about relative frequencies : " How often amongst a sequence of many throws do we throw a six ? " What connection has this concept with the direction of time ? Only future events are possible . They alone have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their happening . Past events are facts . To ask about the probability of their occurrence is senseless , for they are already realised . Already fifty years ago , the philosopher Bergson had stressed this basic difference between the open , uncertain future and the performed past as distinguishing the structure of real time ( duree rielle ) from the physicists ' formal spatial concept of time . This is rather ironical for , not clearly understood by physicists and outside the paths of philosophers , it was just this time structure which was used in the statistical derivation of the second law . In detail the usual argument runs as follows : let a physical system be in any macro-state whatever . We ask in what macrostate it will be a little while later . To predict this exactly we should really know its micro-states . These , however , are unknown . Therefore , we can only ask with what probability the system will pass into one or another state . Now , macrostates differ as to micro-states contained in them . For instance , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecules is the same . Let one be cooled to absolute zero and let its entire kinetic energy be used to set the body as a whole moving through space at great speed . Let the other be considered as a whole body at rest , and let the kinetic energy of its molecules be in the form of a disordered to-and-fro motion , i.e. of heat . Both are well-defined macro-states . In the first case the micro-state is completely determined by the macro-state ; every molecule has the same velocity ( both in // magnitude and direction ) as the centre of gravity of the whole body . In the second case , there are possible innumerable forms of motion of the individual molecules ; this macro-state comprises very many different micro-states . Now the micro-state of a body will develop on the basis of the physical processes going on in it and of the interaction with neighbouring systems , but we do not know the details of how this will happen . After some considerable time has passed , the body will be in some other micro-state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is , nevertheless , obviously more probable that this micro-state will belong to a macro-state which comprises many micro-states , rather than that it should be " snatched " into a macro-state containing only a few microstates , let alone one . In the case of the fast-moving body at absolute zero mentioned above , the body may , for instance , redistribute its total energy to its molecules through some kind of interaction . It is extremely improbable that , after such an interaction , its molecules will still all be moving parallel to each other . It is much more probable that the body will be in one of the many micro-states classified under the heading of " disordered internal movements " , i.e. most probably its kinetic energy of macro-movement is changed into heat . If , on the other hand , we consider the warm body at rest in the second case mentioned above , and if we let its molecules exchange energy , it is most probable that the molecules will still be moving in a disordered way . It is most improbable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , i.e. that mechanical energy is created from heat . The improbable occasionally happens . We know of " fluctuations " in which heat visibly produces movement . An example is the Brownian movement of small particles suspended in air or in water , which can be observed in the microscope : an irregular , aimless to-and-fro movement which becomes the livelier the smaller the particles are . This movement is due to the fact that these dust particles are being continually struck by the even smaller molecules , now from the one , now from the opposite side . However , to see a stone jump up from the ground due to a sudden cooling , we should have to wait a time greater than the age of the earth . In this case , such a very great improbability is a practical impossibility . Chapter 7 THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC FIELD SOUND and heat can be derived from motion and since the seventeenth century there have also been mechanical theories of light . Newton assumed that light rays were the trajectories of small material particles . Huygens considered light as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fresnel showed , through their interference experiments , that light did in fact have the nature of a wave . It was known that the spectral decomposition of white light into colours , discovered by Newton , is the equivalent of a division into wave-lengths : the difference in colour is simply an immediate sense experience of what we call the difference in wave-lengths of different vibrations . The Problem of Light What is it that vibrates when we see light ? It is not the air or any other known material medium . Light can pass both through evacuated glass tubes , and through interstellar space dividing us from the sun and the distant stars , without being impeded . A very thin , all-pervading body capable of vibrating ? the ether ? was postulated as an attempted explanation . Lord Kelvin confessed that the ether was nothing but the subject of the verb " undulate " . The assumed mechanical properties of the ether ( greatest possible rigidity because of the quick propagation of light , and at the same time , lowest possible density because it has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other manifestations of this unknown something , called the ether , had been observed for quite some time , but their connection with light was still unknown : electrical and magnetic effects . At the turn of the eighteenth century , these had become the object of great discoveries and much speculation . They were the first examples of an unquestionable physical reality , which could neither be perceived 59 // by our senses , nor imagined simply by means of " material " pictures . Light , sound , heat are immediate sense data . Electricity and magnetism were first deduced from the ability of certain bodies to move other bodies . Only the mechanical concept of force allowed us to give a quantitative description of electricity and magnetism as the causes of these measurable movements . Faraday discovered that it was not in the bodies which were known as carriers of electricity and magnetism , but in the space between them ? the electro-magnetic field ? that the decisive processes took place . Maxwell derived the theoretical result , that this field ought to be capable of sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio and radar are the technical consequences of this discovery . Now , there were two kinds of unexplained waves ? those of light and those of electro-magnetism . Was there an " electromagnetic ether " as well ? What was the physical reality of Faraday 's field ? Both problems are , in fact , only one problem . Maxwell established that , in a given medium , electro-magnetic waves must travel with the same velocity as light , and he concluded that light was an electro-magnetic wave motion . Today this theory is confirmed in many ways . A little later on we shall discuss the wave-length scale of electro-magnetic waves in which visible light occupies only a modest octave . Today the laws for the field quantities are known in the form of Maxwell 's equations of the electro-magnetic field . All the many endeavours to find mechanical models which would give such laws of motion have been fruitless . Michelson 's experiment and its interpretation by Einstein in the special theory of relativity ( see page 90 ) show that the " ether " can not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . The search for mechanical ether models was gradually abandoned . Today we know , from atomic physics , that the impenetrability and the elasticity of matter are not basic properties , but that they follow from the deeper " quantum mechanical " laws as certain limiting cases . The familiar forms of matter ? solid or gaseous ? which were taken to serve as models for the ether , are themselves only superficial manifestations. // Inside the atoms electrical forces are at work . Thus we must not reduce electricity to mechanics , but rather mechanics to electricity . Today the electro-magnetic field , as described by Maxwell 's equation , is taken as a fundamental reality of nature whose connection with elementary particles or fields has not yet been explained . That this has not led us to a " mechanical " theory of light ( comparable to the theories of sound and heat ) is due to the fact that the electro-magnetic field , in contradistinction to the material field , does not produce any separate " bodies " , such as atoms . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is due to the fact that while matter obeys Pauli 's Exclusion Principle , the electro-magnetic field does not . The limitation of the wave concept which is connected with the discovery of light quanta , will be discussed in Chapter 1o . Processes in the Electro-magnetic Field The term electro-magnetism covers two groups of phenomena , whose connection was only discovered in the beginning of the nineteenth century : electricity , discovered by the effects of amber ( Greek : =amber ) and cat 's fur , of which the most impressive manifestation was lightning ; and magnetism , originally known as a property of iron and magnetite . These phenomena remain separate , as long as static processes unchanging in time are considered ; but even in static cases they have very similar properties . Electricity and magnetism both appear in two related polar forms . We differentiate between " positive " and " negative " electricity , " north " and " south " magnetism . However , while the two forms of electricity can be separated from each other , those of magnetism can not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , while a piece of iron , for instance , can only be polarised magnetically so that one of its ends contains a north pole and the other a south pole . The first demonstration of electrical charges was made possible through the force that charged bodies exert on one another according to the law : equal charges repel , unequal charges attract each other . Exactly the same law is valid for magnetic poles . // The correspondence of the laws goes even further . A very narrowly concentrated charge in space exerts on another equally concentrated charge a force that is inversely proportional to the square of the distance ( Coulomb 's law ) . Exactly the same law applies to the magnetic pole . It must be stressed that the mathematical form of the law is exactly the same as that of Newton 's law of gravitation . Today we are of the opinion that this agreement is no accident . To gravitation , electricity , and magnetism alike there apply simple basically similar field equations , and it is for this reason that they have similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the elementary fields and , although we do not understand it fully , the reason may well be connected with the foundations of geometry ( the theorem of Pythagoras ) . When charges move we have an electric current . Galvani and Volta found a continuous source of current in chemical processes taking place in solutions . Today we know that during electrolysis , electrically charged particles of the atoms separate from each other and travel towards the opposite terminals ? the electrodes . The quantities characterising a current are related by Ohm 's law : the current is equal to the potential divided by the resistance . The current is that quantity of charge which flows through the conductor in unit time . The expression current is reminiscent of water currents . The strength of the current then corresponds to the rate of streaming of the water . The potential in this comparison corresponds to the pressure gradient of the water flow . The simile is exact . The charge moves because an electrical force is acting on it . Force times distance equals the work done , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of charge conveyed and the potential . In a metal wire it is the electrons , which we shall consider more fully when discussing atomic physics , that are the carriers of the current . The strength of the current is then proportional to the number of electrons moving through the conductor per unit time . The resistance can equally be understood as the frictional resistance which the electrons experience in rushing through the metal built up of atoms . As in every other case of friction , heat is created ( Joule 's law ) . The law of the conservation of energy can also be proved in the case of electricity . // Oersted discovered that every electric current is surrounded by a magnetic field . Ampere found that a magnetic field exerts a force on an electric current . This could have been expected from Oersted 's discovery , since the current causing the magnetic field acts just like a pair of magnetic poles ( a solenoid , for instance , acts like a rod magnet ) , and we know that magnetic fields exert forces on magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon was discovered by Faraday , namely induction : a change of magnetic field in the vicinity of an electrical conductor produces a current in the latter . A moving magnetic field corresponds to an electromotive force . This is a symmetrical completion of Oersted 's discovery , according to which a moving electric charge creates magnetic forces . Field and Action at a Distance In our previous considerations we often had to use the concept of " field " . We must now define it a little more precisely . Let us think of a charge concentrated in space ( point charge ) . It exerts on another point charge ( the test body ) brought into its vicinity , a force which depends , according to Coulomb 's law , on the distance between both charges . Thus , the process could theoretically be ascribed to effects at a distance . But equally well we could say that the charge changes the condition of space in its vicinity , and that the force on the test body is just the way in which this change manifests itself . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge of the test body and the electrical field strength , at any place on the test body . Coulomb 's law then states that in the neighbourhood of a point charge the electrical field strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from it . Thus read , it is a law of field physics . Magnetic field strength is defined in an analogous manner . The difference between the theories of actions at a distance and of fields is so far only a difference in modes of expression . A factual difference appears only in the case where the field is changing in time . If a charge is moved , the question arises as to whether the whole field follows this motion instantaneously , i.e. , whether it is rigidly fixed to the charge , or whether changes in the field can only be propagated with a finite // velocity . This difference can be conceived as a difference in our ideas as to the causality prevailing in the field . According to the first hypothesis , the strength of the field at every place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " action at a distance " ) . According to the second assumption , the field exerts effects on the field at neighbouring or contiguous points ; field-changes are not only effects , but also causes . If all field-changes spread only in this manner , we speak of a consistent " contact-action theory " . Faraday and Maxwell built up a theory satisfying contiguity . The fact that field-changes appear as the causes of other fieldchanges is especially noted in Maxwell 's concept of the " displacement current " . The strength of the magnetic field produced by a current is given by the Biot-Savart law in which a closed circuit is considered as a magnetic " double layer " a pair of north and south poles spread over planes placed immediately next to each other , whose ( dipole ) strength depends on the strength of the current and the area circumscribed by the current ( see page 6i ) . This is proved by experiment . But what happens if the circuit is not completely closed ; for instance , if two plates facing each other ( condenser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are discharged by means of a wire loop ? Maxwell noticed that although no charges travel in the open part of the circuit between the plates , something physical takes place : during the discharge of the condensers , the electrical field becomes reduced . Maxwell considered this change of field as equivalent to a current , calling it a " displacement current " , and he assumed that , like any other current , it produces a magnetic field . Only in this way can symmetry with Faraday 's law of induction be established , for since a magnetic pole current does not even exist , it is only the change of the magnetic field in the neighbourhood of the conductor which can be responsible for the origin of the electromotive force or , in other words , the electric field strength . Experiment has confirmed Maxwell 's hypothesis . The latter leads to the electro-magnetic wave being considered // as a process in which changes in field are propagated through space alternately as effect and as cause . Waves in the Field Let us consider an electro-magnetic analogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us apply electric charges of opposite sign to the two ( plates of a condenser so that there a is a given potential difference between them . If we connect the plates by means of a conductor , for instance a coil of wire , then the charge will flow through the conductor in the form of a current . According to Oersted this builds up magnetic fields in the neighbourhood of the conductor . According to Faraday this field , since it is changing and not constant in time ? it appears and disappears ? induces an electrical potential in the conductor itself . This process is called self-induction . This potential is opposite to the original potential of the condenser . After having first been discharged by means of the current , the condenser is now recharged in the opposite sense by this induction . The process is then repeated in the reverse direction and so on ; this is fully analogous to mechanical vibrations : to the state of maximum the displacement of a pendulum ? there corresponds the state of the greatest discharge of the condenser ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pendulum when traversing the position of rest , there corresponds the E // maximum value of the current at that point in time , in which the condenser changes from one polarity to the other . Just as a mechanical vibration is damped by friction , so the electromagnetic energy is used up by the electrical resistance of the oscillatory circuit ( for as we have seen , electrical resistance can be considered as the frictional resistance of the electrons in the conductor ) : " a damped electrical vibration " is produced . A collapse of the electric field in the condenser is re- tarded by self-induction in the conductor ; at first the current increases against the self-induced counter potential . With large self-induction , therefore , the charge decays very slowly . As a result the charge on the condenser plates can distribute itself equally at every moment . Although the charge is led away by the conducting wire only at one single point of each plate , the remaining charge has a sufficient time to distribute itself evenly on the rest of the plate . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all points of the condenser . If , however , the self-induction of e in the conductor is very small , the electric field of the condenser collapses very rapidly . The charges no longer have time to balance one another , and the field strength at different points of the condenser will be noticeably different . In this case , the electric field will travel with a very high , but finite , velocity along the condenser . A field travelling in this way is a displacement current in Maxwell 's sense , and thus produces a similarly moving magnetic field in its neighbourhood . The // magnetic field on its part , induces a moving electric field in its neighbourhood . Thus , the oscillation of current and field in the condenser produces a series of oscillating fields in neighbouring space . These can spread from the oscillatory circuit into space just as sound waves produced by a vibrating membrane spread through the neighbouring air . However , the radiation of electro-magnetic waves in the closed oscillatory circuit , which we have considered so far , is very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By an electric dipole we generally mean two equal and opposite electric charges a certain distance apart . We produce a dipole by means of two wire halves whose free ends project into space . These two wire halves may be considered as being two unfolded condenser plates . The wire halves , just like the condenser plates in the closed oscillatory circuit , are alternately given positive and negative charges , and the current , the amplitude of which is greatest midway between the two dipole halves , can be demonstrated , for instance by the glow of a little lamp . The distribution of the current , which in the dipole looks like a standing wave , is given by the distribution of the electric field of the dipole which changes quickly with time , closing the circuit in the form of a displacement current around the dipole . Measurement of the velocity of propagation of the electric field ? in the laboratory this is most easily done by determining the frequency and measuring the wave-length of a dipole whose two wire halves point in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of propagation is equal to that of light . In the Lecher system the waves propagated between the parallel wires spread freely into space . To every change of electric field strength in any part of space , there again corresponds a given magnetic field , determined both in magnitude and direction by Maxwell 's hypotheses , and again to every change of magnetic field there corresponds an electric field . The picture created by the superposition ( interference ) of all these fields in space is best represented by diagrams of the lines of force of the electric field strengths , as introduced by Hertz . It is clear from this that the greatest part of the energy is radiated at right angles to the dipole ; no radiation takes place in the direction of the dipole . ( See Figs. 6-9 ) . Light waves differ from the electro-magnetic waves pro68 CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS duced in the wire dipole only in that they have a very much shorter wave-length , or in other words , a far greater frequency . The complete electro-magnetic spectrum comprises radio , infra-red , light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio-active y-rays and the I km. energy-rich photons from cosmic radiation to which we shall refer later , belong to the domain of electro-magnetic waves ( Table II ) . ) Transition to Geometrical Optics Geometrical optics uses an older , phenomenological approach : a " light ray " is compared with the undisturbed rectilinear motion of a . material particle in space , as in mechanics . This method is indispensable , even today , a as first approxi- ? mation in calculations concerning loo optical instruments . It is justified in view of the small wave-length of visible light . As we have already explained in the case of sound , waves are propagated rectilinearly if their wave-lengths are very much smaller than the obstacles which stand in their way . The " ray " is then the direction of propagation of the waves ; // the wave front . The wave-lengths of visible light lie between 8 . I o 5 cm for red light , and 4 . I o-5 cm for blue light , and are thus very small indeed compared with the dimensions of optical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a light wave ( conical wave ) emerging from a point light source can be made as // small as desired by means of an eye-piece , without disturbing the process of propagation , until we have a " ray " which , in a homogeneous medium , is rectilinear . A wave with a small angle of aperture is thought of as composed of an infinite number of rays which are completely independent of one another . In geometrical optics it is further assumed that the ray could equally well travel in the reverse direction . It is obvious that both the rectilinear propagation and also the independence and the reversibility of light rays neglect the diffraction effects due to the wave nature of light ; for what was originally a single light ray would , after diffraction at a very narrow slit ( see page 37 ) , be split ELECTRICAL LINES into different rays corresponding to individual diffraction maxima . This process is obviously not reversible . The diffraction effects HALF in optical instruments must there- fore , be taken into account in the Fm . 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different media is lar to dipole ) . H governed by the laws of reflection and refraction . In the simple language of geometrical optics , reflection means the bending of the light ray back from the interface into the first medium , and refraction the sudden change of direction at the interface by an amount solely determined by the nature of the media . A deeper cause of refraction and reflection is to be found in the differing velocities of propagation in the two media . Since the frequencies in both media are equal , being determined by the source of light , the wave-lengths of the light are different . Considerations of the continuity of electric and magnetic field strengths lead to the laws of reflection and refraction ; an exact consideration of the boundary conditions at the interface gives us the amount of light reflected and refracted and also the directions of vibration of the electric and magnetic field strengths ( polarisation relations ) . Applications : Radio and Radar The vibration produced in an oscillatory electrical circuit consisting of a condenser and a wire coil ( having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , quickly disappear because of damping . The production of undamped electric vibrations required for news transmission and for wireless , is done by means of a relay-like feedback circuit using an electron tube ( see Fig. 9 ) ? the function of which we shall discuss later ( see page 78 ) the condenser always receives the full charge at the right moment . This process corresponds to the fact in mechanics that a pendulum ( for instance that of a clock ) , is restored to its original maximum displacement by a small extra impulse during each vibration . The changes in the self-induced magnetic field produce a current in a second coil connecting the two ends of a stretched wire dipole . This current oscillates with the same frequency ( the principle of the transformer ; " inductive coupling " ) . In this way , the oscil lations of the closed oscillatory circuit are transmitted to the open dipole circuit ? the transmitter which radiates the energy into free space . The field changes spread through space with the velocity of light and can produce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same frequency ( resonator ) a current oscillating with the same frequency . This is amplified further by a receiver . Now the electrical oscillatory circuits of radio transmitters give frequencies ( I o 5-3 . I o 8 Hz ) , which are far greater than those which can be perceived by the human ear . They can therefore not serve for the immediate transmission of sound . For this reason , the very high but constant carrier frequency of the oscillatory circuit in the transmitter , must be modulated by the audio-frequency . This can be done by synchronising the amplitude of the constant carrier frequency with the much lower audio frequency ( amplitude modulation ) . By means of suitable circuits , amplitude variations are changed in the receiver into current variations , which are then ? for instance in a loud-speaker ? changed back into the mechanical vibrations of a membrane , and thus into sound vibrations . It is understandable that amplitude modulation is easily upset by any changes in the field , produced for instance by electric discharges in the atmosphere ( lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the discharges , which in themselves are high frequency vibrations , produce strong field changes to which the receiver is sensitive . Sound transmission by frequency modulation is largely free from effective field disturbances ( and from the effects of transmitters broadcasting on adjacent wavelengths ) and is therefore used in modern very-high-frequency ( VHF ) transmission . Here the frequency of the transmitting wave is modulated according to the transmitting tone frequency ( see Fig. 1o ) . Short Wave Techniques Electro-magnetic vibration of wave-lengths less than I metre can not generally be produced in an ordinary valve transmitter , since the wave-length would then be of the same order of magnitude as the structural elements . The transit-time of the electrons in the tubes used ( see page 78 ff. ) would then become comparable with the period of the oscillation and conditions in the tube would no longer correspond regularly to the changes in potential . On the other hand , wave-lengths of approximately 10 cm and less have become necessary in the last few years for the important radar techniques , i.e. for the detection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reflected from the // object back to the receiver requires , as we have already seen , wave-lengths which are small compared with the " beam transmitter " producing the radiation , and with the irradiated object . These extremely short ( decimetre and centimetre ) waves are produced in special circuits or ? in most cases ? by means of " magnetrons " ( see page 8o ) . The transmitter then delivers a wave impulse of very short duration . This travels from the transmitter to the object and is sent back to the receiver which is located next to the transmitter . The time taken by the signal can be measured by means of a cathode-ray tube ( see page 82 ) . From it , just as in depth sounding , we can infer the distance of the objects . In this way we can determine fairly accurately the direction and distance of aeroplanes , ships , etc . The technique of very short electro-magnetic waves has been of especial importance in the measurement of the ion content of the upper stratosphere , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Heaviside-layer and the charges in it . The ultra-violet radiation of the sun causes electrons , in layers between 8o and 500 km above the earth , to be split off from the atoms and the molecules of the air , so that there remain positively charged ions and molecules together with free electrons . The density of these charged particles in the ionospheric layer is great enough for the layer to act like a metal towards electro-magnetic waves of certain wave-lengths . The charges resonate and reflect the wave . That wave-length which is only just reflected is a measure of the electron density of the reflecting layer . The height of this layer can again be found from the difference in time between the transmitted and the reflected signal . Using electro-magnetic waves of so short a wave-length that they can penetrate all layers of the ionosphere , investigators have managed to reach the surface of the moon and to demonstrate the radiation reflected by it . The reflected signal was received approximately 2.4 seconds after transmission . For some years we have known with certainty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centimetre waves penetrates the earth 's atmosphere in the form of cosmic short-wave radiation . Only recently could it be proved that our sun also transmits such very short-wave radiation . A relation has been established between the in THE // tensity of this short-wave radiation and the number , surface area and arrangement of sunspots . All the cosmic short-wave radiation is perhaps the sum of the contributions from single stars in which processes like that in the sun produce short-wave radiation . Visible Light and Related Fields A prism divides white sunlight into its spectral colours . However , it not only produces the visible colours of red , yellow , green , blue and violet , but even beyond both red and violet can the existence of energy still be demonstrated . Beyond the red , in the infra-red region of the spectrum , the energy can be demonstrated by a simple thermometer ? the mercury is found to be heated by an invisible , i.e. infra-red radiation , and shows a rise in temperature . It is this radiation which is emitted by a warm , invisibly glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a screen impenetrable to this radiation . The wave-lengths of the infra-red spectrum range from the limit of visible light ( about o ? 8 ? =8. i o 5 cm ) to the shortest wave-length that can be produced by magnetrons ? microwaves ? i.e. up to an order of magnitude of one millimetre . The longest wave-length of infra-red radiation hitherto observed is that in the spectrum of the mercury vapour lamp : the radiation has a wave-length of about 0.3 mm and already shows all the properties of an " electrical " wave . In recent times , infra-red radiation has been used technologically . Air drying of lacquer and thin film layers and also of textile fibres and materials after certain preparatory processes , has today been replaced by infra-red drying . The drying time compared with previous methods has already been reduced to a filth . The success is mainly due to the fact that the longwave infra-red manages to penetrate to a certain depth of the object to be dried and thus dries the whole layer through its entire thickness . Visible and infra-red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infra-red photography can be used with advantage in those cases where visible light can show no fine details , or where it is absorbed . Infra-red photography is used for the investigation of colours , for instance , in the textile industry , in medicine , and in // criminology , for testing paintings , and for photo-microscopy . It has special advantages for landscape photographs since mist and fog are penetrated by infra-red " light " , and also for photography in the dark . There are even stars and other astronomical objects which appear much more clearly on infra-red plates than on normal photographic plates . Thus in 1944 . Baade , at the Mount Wilson Observatory , managed to resolve the nuclei of the nearest extra-galactic nebulae ( for instance the Nebula in Andromeda ) into single stars . Many nebulae in our own Milky Way were only properly recognised on plates sensitive to the red . Microscopes and Telescopes The properties of visible light , ranging between wavelengths of o ? 8 and o ? 4 are generally known . Optical instruments , concave mirrors and lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the angle under which the object appears to the eye . Optical techniques are used to reduce the degree of distortion of a picture over the entire field , and to increase the resolving power of the instruments , i.e. the ability to distinguish two neighbouring points . The resolving power of an optical instrument is limited by the fact that because the light beams are narrowed through the objective , tube , or ocular , etc. , two very close points can only be perceived separately if the first diffraction maximum of one lies on the first diffraction minimum of the other ( Rayleigh ) . Since that angle subtended by the two objects when they can just be distinguished is inversely proportional to the diameter of the lens , or in the telescope of the convex mirror , and especially since the brightness of the constellations against their background is proportional to the square of this diameter , it becomes understandable that astronomers are building telescopes with ever greater mirrors . The new telescope on Palomar Mountain in California has a mirror of 200 inches diameter ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human eye , and theoretically it can produce a magnification of 20,000 x . However , because of the movements of the earth 's atmosphere , this can not be utilised fully . In time , this instrument will no doubt enable us to measure the proper motions of neighbouring fixed stars // accurately enough to determine whether they are affected by the gravitational effects of possibly existing planets . Above all , the great telescope is meant to give us an accurate knowledge of the structure of the most distant objects of the universe . The technical difficulties in the use of this instrument are very great already . We must consider that its effectiveness depends on the precision with which the mirror is adjusted and with which the temperature is kept constant throughout its entire diameter , for even the smallest and most insignificant difference in temperature produces deformation in its surface , and this causes the image to deteriorate . In the microscope the maximum resolving power has been reached in practice . The resolution can be increased only if we diminish the wave-lengths used which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of the electron microscope ( see page 81 ) . Nevertheless , in the optical industry there are ever new practical improvements . For instance it is now possible to demonstrate elements of structure which are both transparent and colourless , but which differ in their refractive index , i.e. in the velocity with which light passes through them . The difference in the velocity of light in two different media produces small phase differences in the light rays passing through . The latter can not be detected by the eye since it distinguishes only radiations of different amplitude and not of different phase . In " phase contrast " procedure the phase difference is subsequently brought out by a suitable method ? for instance , by the inter-position of a plate delaying the light by half a wave-length , so that clear interference pictures are created and the phase structure is made visible to the eye as an amplitude structure . Furthermore , beyond the violet of the visible spectrum there is short-wave radiation which is imperceptible to the human eye ? namely ultra-violet light . Radiation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong effect on the skin , especially at great heights , is well known . The greater part of the ultra-violet light coming from the sun is however absorbed in the ionospheric layers where it ionises the air . The density of these charged particles formed in space is measured by the reflection of very short electro-magnetic waves as we have already discussed ( page 71 ) . // X-rays The shorter wave-lengths ( higher frequencies ) of the electro-magnetic spectrum are followed by ultra-violet light , and then by X-rays . During experiments with Lenard tubes , designed for the production of free electrically charged particles , Rontgen discovered a radiation that emanated from the point at which the electrons met the glass wall or the metal part inside , and which had a far greater power of penetration than all previously known rays . Von Laue showed by means of diffraction phenomena in crystals ? of which we shall speak in greater detail below ( see page 137 ) ? that X-rays were of even shorter wave-length than ultra-violet rays . The wave-lengths of X-rays are between approximately 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loss in intensity which , as was shown by all experiments , can be represented by an exponential law ? i.e. in layers of matter of equal thickness the same fraction of the penetrating radiation is always absorbed . The absorption depends on the wave-length used , and on the atomic weight of the absorbing medium . It is for this reason that X-rays can be used for examining the human body with great advantage ; for organs which contain heavier atoms than their surroundings , absorb X-rays far more strongly than the surroundings , and therefore look brighter on the X-ray negative . Cavities of the body to be investigated may be filled previously with contrast media containing especially heavy atoms ( for instance bismuth ) , so that they appear on the photograph as clear structures . Similarly , machine tools , etc. , may be examined by X-rays , giving a method of testing which does not harm the material . Cracks , gas bubbles , foreign inclusions , etc. , can be made very clearly visible by X-ray . There are electro-magnetic vibrations of even shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cosmic radiation . We shall deal with these in Chapter I I. Chapter 8 ELECTRONS LET us return from the electro-magnetic field to the charge causing it . It has been noticed that electric charges are freely movable , while magnetic poles can only appear materially tied to the opposite pole . Ampere assumed that all magnetic poles were , in fact , small electric currents , such as electric charges moving round atoms . Today we agree with him . What do we know of charges ? The Foundations It is an old question whether electricity is a continuous fluid or whether it has an atomic structure . This question could only be decided hand in hand with that of the corresponding question for matter itself . In nineteenth-century chemistry , the idea of an atomic structure of matter gained the upper hand . In electrolysis Faraday 's law of equivalences holds . If a current flows between two electrodes that dip into a conducting fluid , then some of the fluid particles are continuously deposited at the electrodes . For instance in a copper sulphate solution , copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . Since an acid radical can not exist independently , it reacts chemically with the electrode and if this is of copper , it reforms copper sulphate which goes into solution . The deposition of the solute at the electrodes is interpreted by assuming that the current in the fluid is the charge transported by the electrically charged atoms ( ions ) themselves . Now Faraday 's law states that with a given quantity of matter there is always transported a given charge , such that a given quantity of charge corresponds to every deposited molecule , no matter what it is . From this Helmholtz and Stoney concluded that the electric charge itself appears in atomic particles . The magnitude of this elementary electrical charge has been measured in different ways . No charge smaller than the elementary charge has ever been demonstrated experimentally . 77 // Now the question arises whether the elementary electric charge must always be tied to an atom , or if it can travel freely through space . Today we know that the latter is the case . This freely moving charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance as cathode rays , when we send an electric current through a highly evacuated vessel ( a Geissler or Crooke 's tube ) . Now a moving electron is equivalent to an electric current on which a magnetic field can exert a force . From the deviation observed , it is concluded that the electron must have a negative electric charge . As we shall see later ( page g8 ) , every atom contains a certain characteristic quantity of electrons so that electrons are present in every body . In metals there are always some electrons moving freely between the atoms . When an electric field is applied , they begin to wander through the metal . Every change of position of the charges is noticed as an electric current . If the applied electric field becomes greater , a greater energy of translation is imparted to the electrons in the metal because of the more violent collisions taking place in the conductor ; the latter becomes heated , a fact which is made use of in electric fires and electric bulbs . Electron Valves or Tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since in it no carriers of electricity are present . If a metal is heated to a high temperature in a vacuum , electrons can be expelled from it and in moving through the vacuum , they form an electric current . This is due to the fact that the electrons moving between the atoms of the metal have obtained such a velocity , that their kinetic energy is great enough to overcome the molecular forces of attraction and so they may leave the metal surface . However , the mean velocity of the electrons in the metallic conductor is not high enough to cause more than a very small percentage of the electrons to be ejected . For this reason the very large number of electrons in the metal is not appreciably reduced . Nevertheless , the electrons leaving the metal surface can produce considerable currents . Electrons can only emerge from cold metal surfaces when they are acted upon by so high an electric field ( approximately Io , volt/cm and more ) , that the molecular forces of attraction are overcome by it . // If we apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which there are one ( electrically ) heated and one cold electrode , then the current of electrons can flow in one direction only . If we apply a negative potential to the hot electrode , electrons can travel only from this electrode to the positive electrode . With reversed polarity , there can be no current of electrons at all since , in practice , the cold electrode can not transmit electrons ( rectification ) . In the X-ray tube the electrons emerging from the glowing cathode are concentrated on the anode , on as small a focus as possible . This is done by means of a special auxiliary electrode in the form of a cylinder ( see also ray focusing in the cathoderay tube , page 83 ) , where the electrons produce the X-rays . The electron collisions generate a great deal of heat ? 99 per cent of the electron energy in collision is not changed into X-rays but into heat ? and the anode must be artificially cooled . By including further electrodes between the glowing cathode and the anode , it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process which is practically free of inertia and effort , and which is useful in many physical and technological problems . In the three-electrode-tube ( triode ) a mesh-like electrode called the grid , is put in circuit between cathode and anode . If the grid is given a strong negative charge , the electrons emerging from the cathode can not overcome the negative grid potential and therefore can not reach the anode : there is no current in the valve , the valve is " blocked " . From a certain anode potential upwards ? and increasingly with greater potential ? the electrons that would otherwise lie in front of the cathode as space charge clouds , can now pass through the grid ( working range of the triode ) until finally at a given ( not very high ) positive grid potential , the current between the cathode and anode remains constant . By means of small changes in the grid potential , considerable changes in the anode current corresponding to the change in grid potential can be produced in the working range ; in this way the anode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relay and amplifier , the electron valve has become the most important means of news transmission . For special purposes further grids s0 CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS can be put in the circuit , or several electron valve systems can be combined in one valve . For the production of electro-magnetic waves with wavelengths of not less than I metre , normal electron valves with the usual circuits no longer suffice . Here electron valves with special circuits must be used or , for greater power , special tubes or valves must be employed , for instance magnetrons in which the electrons go into a state of vibration , producing high frequency current alternations between the anode and the cathode . We have already seen that when the temperature of a metal in a vacuum is raised some of the electrons have such high kinetic energy that they can leave the metal . However ( as we shall explain later ) an increase in kinetic energy can also be produced through electro-magnetic radiation , light , X-rays , etc . If , for instance , light falls on a cathode , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in a vacuum ( e.g. the photo-electric cell ) , electrons will emerge from the cathode ( photo-electric effect ) when only a low potential is applied ; a current between cathode and anode can be shown to flow outside the vacuum . To demonstrate the presence of very small numbers of electrons due to this photo-electric effect the electron current originally transmitted is amplified , by causing the primary electrons to expel secondary electrons from a further electrode and so on in a third , fourth electrode , etc . This produces an avalanche-like multiplication . With these photo ( or secondary electron ) multipliers we can obtain an intensification factor of up to about one million for measuring weak light sources . The expulsion of electrons by light can take place not only in a vacuum and on the surfaces of metals , but also inside transparent materials , for instance , inside a crystal . Under the influence of an applied electric field the electrons begin to travel and thus lead to a greater conductivity of the material ( photo-elements ) . Semi-conductors have recently begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike superconductors ( see page 140 ) , semiconductors lose their conductivity as absolute zero is approached , and generally increase it with higher temperature , largely due to the thermal excitation of // the electrons . If the possibilities of electron migration differ in individual regions of a semiconductor , e.g. a transistor ( a crystal that has been split into , say , three separate regions ) , then , by applying a bias voltage across the boundary between the first two regions , the current through the other boundary region is cut down . In this way , transistor circuits can be used to produce large gains in input voltage . Electron Optics Since the electron carries a charge , its direction of motion can be influenced by electric and magnetic fields . An electron propelled into the space between the two plates of a parallelplate condenser is attracted by the positive plate . Its original rectilinear trajectory is therefore curved towards the positive plate . In a homogeneous magnetic field at right angles to its motion , an electron describes a circular path which ? as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by considering the moving electron as a current on which , according to the law of induction , a corresponding force is acting . We can now arrange the electric and magnetic fields in such a manner that the electrons spreading from a given point in different directions can be focussed , just as by optical lenses in the case of visible light . // The electric and magnetic " lenses " produced in this way have the great advantage over optical ones that their " focus " can be altered at any time by variations of potentials and currents . By means of electric and magnetic lenses we can build microscopes which like optical microscopes magnify very small structural elements , but which have the further advantage ( because of the very small wave-lengths of the electrons ? see below ) of having a far greater resolving power than an ordinary microscope ( see Figs. i I and 13 ) . Electron or ultra-microscopy is of special importance in chem istry and medicine . Today already the smallest viruses , protein and fibre structures , large organic molecules , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the electron-microscope . Theoreti , we should be able to demonstrate even a molecule or an atom in the electron microscope , but not all the practical difficulties have been overcome so far . In the last few years a field electron microscope has been developed in which the spherical cap of a very fine metal point ( as negative electrode ) is made to throw an image on a screen . At the metal point there is a field of about 4.1o7 .. I o7 V /cm so that the electron can be expelled by means of field emission and is then propagated from the surface radially and rectilinearly . The linear magnification in this arrangement is up to the order of i os , the resolution up to about 3.10-8 cm , i.e. approximately 10 hydrogen molecule diameters . It can however be increased even further under special conditions ( for instance by the absorption of flat molecules on the metal point ) ( see Fig. 13 ) . Cathode Ray Tubes In electron optics there are also used cathode ray tubes : electrons produced by a glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cathode , and having a small hole in the centre through which the electrons can pass . To produce a very fine electron beam the cathode is made as pointed as possible and in its immediate vicinity there is placed an auxiliary electrode ? which is generally given a weak negative charge ( " Wehnelt-cylinder " ) ( see Fig. 12 ) . The electron beam falls on a screen and produces a bright spot on it . If we allow the stream of electrons to pass through a pair of condenser plates in its path , it will be deviated by an amount corresponding to the magnitude of the potential applied to the condenser , and the bright spot on the screen will be deviated more or less from its original position . If we arrange a further pair of plates perpendicular to the first pair , we can study the relation between two magnitudes . In many cases , the horizontal displacement of the beam is used as the time axis . The spot on the screen is made to travel in the horizontal direction , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical deviation can be conceived as dependent on the time . For instance it can then follow very rapid potential impulses , and it is an essential measuring instrument for rapid variations in current and potential ( oscillograph ) . // In a similar way the deviation of the beam can also be produced by the magnetic fields set up by the currents to be measured in solenoids mainly outside the tube itself . The technical significance of the cathode ray tube lies in its application in television and radar . In television the spot is directed by the mutually perpendicular deflection plates so that , like handwriting , it runs along a regular sequence of ruled lines . While the spot traverses the screen , its brightness is varied according to that of the corresponding picture . Because of the short after-glow of the screen , and because the eye retains an after-image for a short time , we gain the impression of a full screen picture . The B.B.C. television service uses 415 lines and 50 pictures per second . In radar the reflected signals are reproduced on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the direction of the beam . Their brightness corresponds to that of the reflecting object , so that if the direction of the reflected wave is correctly adjusted with the displacement of the spot of the cathode ray tube , an undistorted electron-optical image of the irradiated surface appears on the screen of the cathode ray tube . This image may be used as a map . Chapter 9 RELATIVITY THEORY RELATIVITY theory can be considered as the completion of the field physics inaugurated by the electro-dynamics of Faraday and Maxwell . However , from a methodological point of view , it is the first conscious step of a new method of thought in the theoretical physics of the twentieth century . Classical and Modern Physics We call the physics of the nineteenth century " classical physics " . This name implies both a recognition and a limitation . Classical physics itself hoped to discover basic laws of nature which were to be valid always and everywhere . Today we believe that although the laws of classical physics hold always , they do not do so everywhere ; more exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Within this domain they are correct and final for all time . Never will eclipses of the sun be calculated by laws other than those of Newton , never will we construct a steam-engine according to laws other than those of classical thermodynamics . According to other laws would here mean according to contradictory ones . The same laws can of course be formulated differently . Furthermore new laws may be discovered which whilst having a greater domain of validity than those of classical physics , nevertheless do not differ from the classical laws within the domain of the latter ? at least not in an experimentally determinable way . These new laws would then have a greater domain of validity in which that of classical physics is included . This state of affairs can be clarified by means of an example . Classical physics can be compared to an accurate map of a small town . This map is based on some general assumptions . For instance , it must be drawn on a flat piece of paper , and therefore supposes that the earth is flat . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a well-defined ( horizontal ) plane of reference ( for instance , that of the market-85 // place ) . Those who know no more than this will readily agree with the assumption that the earth is everywhere flat , even outside the known domain of the small town . Now , modern physics can be compared to the recognition that the earth is round . The world picture of the small townsman is thus completely changed . Nevertheless , every single empirical recognition expressed in the town plan remains completely valid . Since , within the domain of the town , the curvature is immeasurably small , we can here justifiably assume that for all practical purposes the earth is flat . We say that the general theory ( in this case that of the spherical nature of the earth ) changes in the limiting case ( here the limiting case of a small extension ) into the special theory ( here that of the flat earth ) . The example shows that the delimitation of a particular domain of validity is not sharp , and is only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we know the spherical nature of the earth and its ( approximate ) diameter , can we say how far we may go from the market-place of our small town , for the difference between the true shape of the earth and that of a plane still to remain within a given limit . We usually choose this limit so that it corresponds to the degree of accuracy of the measurements we are making . Our example does not show the inevitability of the classical point of departure . A man can leave the town in which he was born , he can travel around the earth : the spherical earth lies , if somewhat abstractly , within the realm of his possible immediate experience and of his powers of imagination . Modern physics , however , deals with objects which are quantitatively beyond direct perception ( atoms can not be seen , an object flying past at the velocity of light can not be followed with the eye , etc. ) , and furthermore its laws state that no rule of similarity exists by means of which these objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern physics differ structurally from those of the perceptual world . While we can use a globe as a model of the spherical earth , which we have also never been able to perceive as a whole , there is no model for the objects of relativity and quantum theory . It is for this very reason that we can not dismiss the ideas of classical physics simply as being merely a preliminary step in physics . Modern physics too is based on experiment . // Experiment , however , is only using our senses . All I have experienced I must be able to describe in a material and conceptual manner . Classical physics describes the utmost limits up to which the concepts of physics can be represented by perceptual models . Immediate sense experiences , therefore , even in modern physics , must always be expressed by means of the concepts of classical physics . It may sound paradoxical that a physics which transcends the domain of validity of classical physics describes all experiments in a classical manner . It is no less paradoxical than the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits of sense perception . That this can be done is based on the laws governing the connections between natural processes ; without this connection there could be no conclusions from what is perceived to what is not perceived , i.e. in the final analysis no human life would be possible . This interconnection is also assumed in the realm of the objects of modern physics , and we confirm it by verifying the predictions made on its basis . However , we no longer formulate it by means of perceptual models , but rather we use an abstract " law of transformation " . By this we mean : A single experiment always gives no more than one aspect of events : a look at the earth from one particular tower , the measurement of one particular property of an atomic structure . A model or a law connects these aspects . From the spherical form of the earth we can deduce how the earth would look from every other tower . The model permits the transformation of one aspect into every other one . A vector , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every different system of co-ordinates . The co-ordinate system chosen by the observer characterises the aspect . What interests us here is how to transform the components from one co-ordinate system to another , and especially , which data do not depend on the co-ordinate system at all ( for instance , the length of the vectors ) . We call these the invariants of the co-ordinate transformations . Now in modern physics the transformation laws of the aspects are no longer put down in conceptual models . Their character as laws of transformation thus emerges more purely and at the same time more directly . This is indicated by the // name itself : relativity theory means no more than that certain physical statements are related to the chosen co-ordinate system . Perhaps I may be permitted to point out how much this method of thought differs from relativism in the common usage of the word . The relativist dissolves the concept of truth by teaching that what is " true " depends on the point of view of the subject . The contemporary physicist knows well enough that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he searches for the laws that determine what is seen from which point . It is just in these laws that he finds that form of truth that can be understood by us . We can choose the point of view , but what we then perceive no longer depends on us . Special Theory of Relativity The problem of the relativity of motion which we left open in our discussion of mechanics was brought into a new light by electro-dynamics . We can follow its development in two stages characterised by the works of Einstein , by concerning ourselves first with inertial motion , and then with all kinds of motion . The question whether we can attribute an absolute significance to the concepts of rest and motion , or whether they are only relative to their respective reference system , that is , if they are to be defined purely as aspects , has remained unsolved in classical physics . It is true , Newton postulated the existence of absolute space and absolute time in which all bodies moved ; rest and motion have an absolute meaning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 years later , Mach noted that this doctrine was no necessary part of classical physics , but an additional metaphysics . For in classical physics there is no experiment to determine whether a body in an absolute sense is at rest or in uniform motion . This " principle of relativity " of classical mechanics is , as we shall see at once , a consequence of the law of uniform motion . It is thus an empirical statement itself , and must therefore be strictly distinguished from the commonplace that we can describe the condition of motion of any chosen body at will : for instance , describing a circus acrobat swinging on the trapeze as at rest , and the motion of all other bodies in this // co-ordinate system as rushing past him . In such a co-ordinate system Newton 's laws are not valid . For instance , in the acrobat system a body on which no force is working , does not remain at rest or in uniform motion ; rather will it execute complicated screw-movements which translated into a reasonable system , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equally privileged " co-ordinate systems for which there is no experiment that can determine a preference , are only those in which Newton 's laws are valid . People in a railway train travelling with constant speed and without any vibration can only tell whether they are moving by looking out of the window . This means that they can not determine their speed absolutely , but only relative to the environment . This is not at all obvious as can be seen from the fact that acceleration can be determined absolutely . If the train should suddenly brake , standing passengers will fall over and the suit-cases be thrown out of the racks . Acceleration can only be produced by forces , and if we should use an accelerated system of co-ordinates , i.e. that of the braking train , then bodies like travellers and suit-cases , which obey the law of inertia , behave as if forces were working on them . The relativity principle is therefore a consequence of the fact that only the second derivative of place with respect to time is determined by the force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is measurably different from every other acceleration ; for zero velocity or zero place-co-ordinates , the corresponding statement is not valid . Newton based his concept of absolute space empirically on the fact that accelerations can be determined absolutely . Whatever this might mean ( see pages 92-93 ) in any case the relativity principle too is a consequence of Newton 's law and the assertion of absolute space is therefore , in so far as places and velocities are concerned , basically unprovable in classical mechanics . ( For the present we shall be content to compare systems which move in rectilinear uniform motion with respect to one another , where Newton 's laws are valid . We call them " inertial systems " . ) This state of affairs was apparently changed by electrodynamics . In it there is an exceptional velocity : the velocity of light . It is independent of the state of motion of the light // source : the luminous body does not emit light corpuscles which , like bullets sent by a flying aeroplane , take part in its motion , but produces waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using , as in the past , a material picture , in the " ether " . It was thought reasonable to consider this ether as a material transmittor of Newton 's absolute co-ordinate system . Experiments were designed to demonstrate motion with respect to this ether . Michelson is responsible for the famous experiment to measure the motion of the earth with respect to the ether . The result , as in all similar experiments , was negative . The principle of relativity also holds in electrodynamics . Equally valid is the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light , i.e. that the measured velocity of light neither depends on the velocity of the light source , nor on the velocity of the observer . For this reason , Einstein raised the two principles of relativity and of the constancy of the velocity of light to the status of basic postulates , and showed that they did not contradict each other if and only if previous conceptions of space and time were discarded . This perhaps can be most easily shown by the following : A light wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity . This means that any chosen velocity added to the velocity of light would again give the velocity of light . But how do we compose velocities ? Velocity is the path traversed in unit time . Hitherto we assumed naively that the length of a measuring rod and time measured with a clock , were inherently constant magnitudes . Einstein , however , found that if the two postulates were true , lengths and time intervals must necessarily depend on the motion of the reference system in which they are measured . This had already been postulated ad hoc by Lorentz as a means of explaining the Michelson experiment . For instance , moving measuring rods become shortened when considered from a stationary reference system , and moving clocks seen from the stationary reference system go more slowly . We can not enter into the mathematical details here , but it may seem reasonable that thus even the concept of velocity depends on the reference system , in a way different from that of classical physics . Einstein 's achievement was to show that even the relativity // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relativity of another concept , of that of the simultaneity of distant events . Two events , which seen from one reference system occur simultaneously , do not need to do so when seen from another reference system . We can not enter into any greater detail , but we can say generally : Einstein recognised that " length " , " time interval " and " simultaneity " belong to the aspect , and that only the " law of transformation " ( the Lorentz-transformation ) set out in the two basic postulates , is the absolute physical assertion at this stage of physics . Energy and Mass A consequence of this theory deserves special mention : the equivalence of energy and mass . We have called the law of the conservation of energy one of the basic laws of physics . Of similar importance is the law of conservation of mass , on which all quantitative chemistry is based . By means of the relativity theory , both laws of conservation were fused into one . In order to satisfy the demand that the law of the conservation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectilinear motion with respect to one another , it follows from relativity theory that the mass of a body in motion , seen from a non-moving reference system , is dependent on its velocity , and , furthermore , that to all masses at rest there must be assigned an energy content ( E ) , which only differs from the mass ( m ) in the factor of the square of the velocity of light ( c2 ) : E=mc2 . In the case of velocities usually considered in macroscopic processes , the change of mass with velocity can not be determined in practice . However , the more the velocity of a body approaches that of light ( as happened , for instance , in the case of electrons in the cathode ray ) , the greater becomes its mass , and thus its resistance to acceleration , until the mass ? according to the theory of relativity ? becomes infinitely large at the velocity of light . The velocity of light is thus the upper limit of the velocity of any body whatsoever ; no bodies can ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy has been confirmed in atomic physics . The energy of some nuclear reactions is so great that the corresponding change in mass of the atoms can be measured directly . // General Relativity Theory Since the concept of absolute space has been discarded in respect of positions and velocities , it does not seem satisfactory to retain it for accelerations . On the other hand , it is an empirical fact that accelerations can be determined even without comparing them with motions in the environment . What does this mean ? Let us consider Newton 's classical pail experiment : The simplest accelerated motion ( bearing in mind that velocities are vectors , see page 22 ) is uniform motion in a circle . In this case inertia can be observed as centrifugal force . We can say of two bodies rotating relative to each other , which of them is really turning : it is that in which a centrifugal force can be observed . Newton demonstrated this in his pail experiment : a bucket containing water is freely suspended by a string ; the bucket is rotated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water surface remains at rest . When , however , the water starts rotating , it climbs up the wall of the bucket and thus reveals the presence of a centrifugal force . In other words , it was not the movement of the water relative to the bucket ( for this was the case only as long as the bucket turned and the water stayed at rest ) , but the rotation against absolute space which produced centrifugal force . On this experiment Newton based his conviction that absolute space is a reality in itself , capable of producing physical effects . Mach criticised Newton 's conclusion . He noticed that Newton had not proved that this centrifugal force could not have been produced by motion relative to the walls of the room , to the earth , or to the aggregate of the most distant stars . Today we know that it can not be the circular motion relative to the stars of our Milky Way that is the cause of centrifugal force ( for the stars of the Milky Way move in orbits implying a normal centrifugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to the aggregate of the galaxies might be responsible . Einstein took over this question of Mach 's and adapted it to the fact that in more recent physics we do not assume any direct interaction between objects separated in space . He therefore introduced a field transmitting the interaction , and found that this field was probably identical with the gravitational field . This is plausible because of the empirical fact that the // mass of a body can be defined in two completely independent ways leading to the same numerical result : either as the constant proportional factor between force and acceleration in Newton 's second law , or as the constant determining the gravitational interaction of the body with other bodies ( the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ) . From this fact follows , amongst other things , that all bodies fall at equal speed in a vacuum : although a body of greater mass is attracted more strongly by the earth , it offers a greater inertial resistance to this force . It follows that in the case of a body falling freely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceleration of the body can be determined without reference to the motion of the environment : we can replace a gravitational field by an acceleration and vice versa . All processes inside a uniformly accelerated body take place just as if the body were at rest in a gravitational field . Einstein therefore postulated the basic equivalence of gravitational fields and accelerations . This equivalence allowed him to work out a theory of the behaviour of matter in any accelerated co-ordinate system , and in any gravitational field . This theory is mathematically too complicated to be given here . Einstein showed that this equivalence could only be strictly valid if one assumes that the true geometry of space deviates from usual Euclidian geometry in having a curvature which varies from place to place . He introduced two fundamental physical quantities into his theory : matter and the gravitational field , which give the structure of space at any point considered . He finally formulated two basic equations : one which shows how matter behaves in any given gravitational field , and a second which shows what gravitational field is produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton and Einstein We still want to pose the question whether this point of view is opposed to that of Newton . It does refute his opinion that space is absolute , a ready-made " lodging house " into which matter has but to move . Newton has , however , been proved right as against Leibniz and Mach : space is a reality which can have physical effects . These effects are attributed by Einstein to the gravitational field which is responsible for the curvature of space . Einstein 's equations can be expressed thus : t CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS le space structure is responsible for the particular motions of latter ; and matter in turn determines the space structure . However , this does not fully answer Mach 's criticism f Newton 's ideas . The gravitational field is not necessarily Illy determined by the distribution of matter . It is possible that infinite space contains only a finite quantity of matter , nd that space at infinity becomes Euclidean . In that case , would not be the motion of matter relative to other matter , but relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ould induce a centrifugal force . Einstein , however , has given possible model of the Universe in which there is a finite total volume of space without space itself being bounded . An analogy of such a space is the surface of a sphere on which a straight " line finally runs back into itself . Such a space could , for instance , have a constant density , and consequently constant urvature in its medium . So far it has been impossible to decide hether this model corresponds to astronomical reality . The General Theory of Relativity predicts three empirically verifiable phenomena : the displacement of a light ray in a ravitational field , a shift to the red in the spectrum of a source L a gravitational field , and the deviation of the orbits of the lanets about the sun from ellipses ( precession of the periheon ) . Although all three effects can only be measured with reat difficulty , they have been demonstrated conclusively . Chapter zo THE FOUNDATIONS ATOMIC physics , in the contemporary sense of the word , presupposes the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their transformations , and with the general laws of nature involved . To assess the contemporary state of our knowledge , it is best to review the stages leading up to it . The Development of Atomic Physics Materialist philosophers had long believed that all reality is the interplay of the smallest , indivisible particles of matter ( atoms ) . An explanation can only be considered satisfactory if it does not assume everything which it wishes to explain . Were atoms as coloured , as scented , as spirited and as fateful as is the world of our physical life , they would not have enthralled the philosophers . It appeared that atoms had to be different from the objects composed of them . On the other hand , one did not wish them to be so different that they became inconceivable , and thus ceased to be a means of explanation . Thus there arose the idea of the primary and secondary qualities of matter . The primary , such as extension , mass , impenetrability , were to be attributed to the atoms themselves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other imponderables were supposed to be produced by the interaction of the atoms with the perceiver . Clear-thinking philosophers such as Leibniz and Kant saw that the assumption of the indivisibility could hardly be reconciled with the primary qualities assumed . Indivisibility is the only property of atoms which does not derive from comparison with sense experience , and it is precisely this indivisibility which is the most important point in the whole atomic picture . Unlimited divisibility is one of the aspects of the mysterious inexhaustibility of the world in which we live . This mystery was to be solved by the atoms . However , is it not true 97 // that what has dimensions must be divisible into parts ? Why should just certain of these very definite parts be indivisible ? In its happy naivete , natural science of the nineteenth century forgot about this problem and created the basis for a broad , empirical exploration of the atoms . On this basis some of the true properties of the atoms were discovered in our century , and with them the old problems of philosophical atomic theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the explanation of the law of constant proportions in chemistry : water , which has the chemical symbol H2O , consists of molecules , each of which contains two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen . All hydrogen atoms are alike just as are all oxygen atoms . Stereo-chemistry goes further and is concerned with the spatial arrangements of these atoms in the molecule . The role of atoms in the physical theory of heat has already been considered as has also our recognition of the atomistic structure of electricity . Further developments of atomic physics have proved by direct methods the existence of the structures called atoms by the chemists ( see page 120 ff. ) , and they have also proved their divisibility . This development took place through the interplay of experimental and theoretical discoveries . These two lines of approach can be followed separately for some part of the way . Radio-activity and Quanta The most important experimental impetus was the discovery of radio-activity by Becquerel , and its investigation mainly by the Curies and by Rutherford . It was shown that radio-activity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutherford produced an atomic model based on his own experiments and those of his pupils : the atom consists of a very small nucleus ( of diameter about 10-12 cm ) which contains almost the entire mass of the atom and which has a positive electric charge , and of a shell of negatively charged electrons which , under the influence of electrical attraction , revolve around the nucleus at a distance of roughly i o-$ cm . This revolution can be likened to the planetary orbits around the sun . The number of electrons in the shell of a particular atom is equal to its atomic number in the periodic system ( see page 136 ) . RadioTHE // active mutations are changes in the atomic nucleus . It emerged from further experimental developments of nuclear physics ( see page 111 ff. ) , that the atomic nucleus consists of two kinds of particles : positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons . The charge on the proton differs from that on the electron only in sign . It is therefore the number of protons in the nucleus which actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines how many electrons an atom can contain in its normal , electrically neutral , state . Radioactive mutation thus corresponds to a transformation of chemical elements . This simple picture , however , as Bohr soon came to realise , is irreconcilable with the ideas of classical physics . An electron revolving around a positively charged nucleus is equivalent to a small dipole , and this should constantly send out electromagnetic waves into space . The electrons would thus have to emit energy until they dropped into the nucleus . The atoms would then neither be stable nor equal . It was Bohr 's achievement that he stuck to this model in spite of this contradiction , and that bearing the latter in mind , he was led to a revision not of the model , but of classical physics itself . He based this theory on the results of what was then an independent theoretical branch of physics , namely quantum theory . In retrospect , we can not directly connect quantum theory with the inner difficulties of the atomic concepts . Boltzmann appropriately used the following argument in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body has many ( in the case of strict continuity , infinitely many ) degrees of freedom of internal movement . We have seen this to be the case for gases and fluids when we considered turbulence ; solid bodies can not flow but can , however , have internal vibrations of different wave-lengths . All forms of mechanical energy imparted to the body through thrusts , etc. , will produce some vibrations of very short wave-length or ? in other words ? of very high frequency . For the statistical reasons which have already been discussed in the sections dealing with the kinetic theory of heat , this energy will hardly ever return into the very few observable macro scopic kinds of motion . In other words , mechanics requires disordered movement on a small scale ; " if there were no heat , it would have to be invented " . // This argument is , however , equally applicable to the interior of finite atoms ? and here it turns into an argument against Boltzmann 's " billiard ball atoms " , for the interior of expanded atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would destroy the explanatory value of the kinetic theory of heat . This theory rests precisely on the fact that the energy does not decay into vibrations of ever smaller wave-length , for only then can equilibrium ever be reached , i.e. the condition of equalised temperature and maximum entropy . Atoms , which can get hot by themselves do not explain heat , they simply shift the problem into a different dimension . This difficulty ( which first arose in considering the problem of the rotation of atoms ) was not taken very seriously by the supporters of the kinetic theory of the time ( with the exception of the most profound of them : J. W. Gibbs ) since there was no model of the atom to confront them with it . When , however , statistical considerations were applied in the case of the electro-magnetic field , the laws of which were known since Maxwell 's time , the same problem emerged . Just as one asks about the most probable division of energy in a piece of matter , one may also ask what is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . iJ Let us think of an empty space with reflecting walls , in which there is nothing but electro-magnetic waves reflected backwards and forwards from the walls . These waves can have many different wave-lengths ( and therefore many different frequencies ) . Every wave of a given frequency and wavelength can be considered as a " degree of freedom " of the radiation field . In the most probable condition , the energy would have to be uniformly distributed over all these different degrees of freedom . Now , however , as one passes to ever greater frequencies , there are ever more degrees of freedom ; the radiation field , strictly speaking , has infinitely many degrees of freedom of infinitely great frequency . Therefore no true state of equilibrium could exist . In time , all energy would go into the degree of freedom with very small wave-lengths ( " ultraviolet catastrophe " ) . In fact , however , such an enclosure containing radiation can empirically be brought to a given temperature , for instance by bringing a small , warm body into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enter into an equilibrium of energy exchange with the radiational field . It then shows a very definite energy distribution over the degrees of freedom : here , above a certain frequency determined by the temperature ( i.e. below a given wave-length ) , there is no longer an equipartition of energy over all degrees of freedom , but a finite amount of energy is distributed over the infinitely many degrees of freedom lying above this limit . Planck 's Quantum In 1900 , Planck explained this discrepancy between experiment and classical physics by the radical assumption of the quantum hypothesis , which we wish to use here in the form of the light quantum hypothesis due to Einstein ( 1906 ) . When dealing with a vibration of given frequency either in a material body or in a radiation field , it is assumed that this vibration can not exchange arbitrary amounts of energy , but must exchange either none at all , or a clearly determined amount which varies as the frequency , or an exact multiple of this amount . Mathematically speaking , the formula for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E =h v. Here h is a new natural constant introduced by Planck , the so-called " quantum of action " . How does this assumption help us to an understanding of our problem ? For higher frequencies it removes the possibility of the equipartition of energy over all degrees of freedom , since above a given frequency ( which depends on the total disposable energy , i.e. on the temperature ) a single degree of freedom would , on the average , receive less than its corresponding energy quantum h v. This , however , is not possible according to the quantum hypothesis , unless it absorbs no energy at all . For this reason , there will be hardly any energy at all in all degrees of freedom above this critical frequency , and only in a few will there happen to be a full quantum hv . The latter will happen the less frequently the higher the frequency , and thus the very high frequencies do not absorb any energy at all , in agreement with experiment . From his hypothesis Planck was further able to derive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Quantum theory can be understood only if one recognises the paradoxical character of its assumptions when considered from the point of view of classical physics . In the latter there is no connection between energy and wave-length . With energy quanta ( photons ) one apparently re-introduces the corpuscular theory of light , despite the fact that the wave theory has been proved by interference phenomena . Let us anticipate historical developments and merely note that in 1924 de Broglie introduced this dualism into matter itself ; ascribing a wave nature to the latter ? an assumption which was soon proved empirically by observation of interference phenomena with electron beams . From this there resulted a further basic equation . The momentum p of a material particle is inversely proportional to the wave-length A of the wave associated with the particle : p=h/A . Here the factor of proportionality is again Plancks constant h ( 6.62 . Io-27 erg. sec ) . Fully conscious of its paradoxical nature , Bohr took over Planck 's quantum hypothesis , in order to explain the equally paradoxical fact of the stability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postulates : 1 . Atoms exist only in sharply defined " stationary states " or " levels " , whose energy content differs by fixed amounts ; there are no intermediate states . 2 . In stationary states the atom radiates no energy at all . Radiation only occurs through transitions between two stationary states . Light is emitted with an energy quantum equal to the energy difference of two stationary levels . The frequency of the emitted light is derived from this energy according to the Planck-Einstein equation E=hv . From these assumptions one is able to explain a number of extraordinarily important facts . The stability of chemical atoms is axiomatically contained in them . There is a " ground level " corresponding to the least possible energy content for every atom , in which it can not radiate at all and is stable for an unlimited time . Apart from this , Bohr was able to derive the spectrum of light radiated by atomic hydrogen : the frequencies of the spectral lines correspond exactly to the calculated energy // differences between the stationary levels . General rules emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The periodic system of the elements was understood in principle ( see page 135 ff . ) . By considering the special theory of relativity , Sommerfeld obtained a quantitative interpretation of the fine structure of the hydrogen lines , and thus also one of the most important empirical confirmations of relativity theory . Quantum Mechanics In spite of its achievements , Bohr 's theory contained many contradictions and nobody knew this better than its author . Its weaknesses remaining from the classical conception were eliminated by a new atomic mechanics which , within its domain of validity , must be considered to be final . This theory was developed through two different approaches : that of Heisenberg ( 1925 ) who followed on Bohr , and that of Schrodinger ( 1926 ) who followed the Einstein and de Broglie approach . The many successes of this theory of quantum and wave mechanics will be indicated in the following pages . First , however , we must explain the bases of their conceptual structures in so far as this is possible without recourse to formulae . Let us choose an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see page 85 ) . Let us , for instance , consider a simple structure such as an electron , and for the sake of simplicity let us assume that all those experiments are technically possible for which our assumptions do not contradict any known laws of nature ( e.g. quantum mechanics itself ) . For instance , let us assume that the position of this electron could actually be measured by means of a microscope . Note that although this can only be done indirectly and inaccurately today ( for instance , by the blackening of the grains of the emulsion on which the electron falls ) , the direct measurement is not beyond technical possibility . The modern electron microscope can reach down to an order of magnitude of a few atomic diameters . For our purposes , however , this is sufficient since we are only concerned with finding a very simple representation of the structure of atoms . Every measurement ends in a sense-datum and thus // leads to a magnitude defined by means of classical physics . For instance , the position of an electron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be measured . Every measurement of this kind gives an " aspect " in the sense that we have already discussed . Now how are these aspects connected ? Classical physics can see no problem here at all . For instance , supposing we wish to measure the position and the momentum of an electron at a given moment . If the forces acting on the electron are known , its path can now be calculated and thus all its possible future " aspects " determined . This , however , can no longer be true in quantum mechanics for the electron has wave properties as well ( see page Ioz ) . These enter in the following way : according to the theory , for any given measurement a certain wave must be associated with the electron . If the momentum is known we could , for instance , say that it is a plane wave or , in other words , one in which points having the same phase lie on a set of parallel planes perpendicular to the path of the particle . Such a wave is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculated by means of the de Broglie relation . If , however , the position of the electron is known , the associated wave is a " wave packet " , i.e. a wave whose amplitude differs from zero only in the close vicinity of the position in which the electron was actually observed . These " wave functions " give the transformation to other aspects by means of a probability statement . If we now measure the position of the electron , the probability statement says : the probability of finding the electron in a given place is given by the intensity of the wave function at this place . The forms of the wave function discussed above show that immediately after a positional measurement there is no probability of finding the electron at any other place ; after an exact measurement of momentum , however , the location of the electron is completely undetermined . A simultaneous and exact knowledge of position and momentum would thus ascribe to the wave function contradictory properties , and must , therefore , be impossible . In fact , it can be shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two magnitudes precludes the simultaneous measurement of the other magnitude ( Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle ) . // Wave theory explains the appearance of the stationary states of the atom ; they are comparable with the fundamental and harmonics of stretched strings ( see Chapter 12 ) . It is obvious that this theory has basically changed our conception of physical reality . The appearance of probability statements has led to assertions that the causal law has here been broken . The decisive point , however , is not the fact that we can no longer calculate subsequent states from a fully determined original state ( this would indeed produce a break in the causal chain ) , but that at any instant only one aspect of any state can be determined ( i.e. either position or momentum ) , and not the complete state as is required by classical models . ' What is new is the fact that fundamentally a determination of the state must be referred to the given observational situation at any instant , and that a total separation between the observing subject and the observed object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeper break in the programme of the physics of modern times ( as established since Galileo and Newton ) than even a failure of the law of causality itself would be . How deep this breach is will become clear from the question which is occasionally put by philosophers : what is the actual role of the experiment in making an " observation " in the quantum mechanical sense ? Is it the physical act of the interaction between measuring apparatus and measured object , or the conscious act of reading the apparatus ? It can be shown that both views are false by themselves , and that the answer must lie in the factual unity of both acts . An experiment is not made without the co-operation of the human body which interacts with the object by means of the measuring apparatus . Observation is at the same time both this physical interrelation and an act of consciousness . One will only be able to think of this consistently after a deliberate rejection of the Cartesian division into resextensa and res cogitans ( see Introduction ) . Elementary Particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be thought of as a change in classical kinematics . However , it says nothing about the elementary units of which atoms are built and the forces acting between these units . H // Table III ( page I o6 ) gives a survey of what are today known empirically as the " elementary particles " . In it every particle is also assigned a field according to the fundamental dualism of quantum mechanics . The relevance of this Table to the structure of . the physics of composite bodies has already been discussed in the Introduction . Here we want to see what questions this empirical material poses for realms beyond quantum mechanics . In modern times the four elements of ancient physics ( earth , water , air and fire ) have been replaced by a great number of basic chemical elements . When the number of known chemical elements had sufficiently increased , regularities ( the " periodic system " ) were discovered which were finally explained by atomic physics . Similarly , before the discovery of the neutron there were two elementary particles of matter : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of elementary particles makes one hope that one day a common root to all elementary particles and fields may be discovered . This is borne out by the fact that elementary particles can be changed into one another in many ways : a photon into an electron-position pair , a neutron into a proton and electron , a proton into a neutron and a positron , etc . Further elementary particles ( mesons ) are produced from the field of force of the atomic nuclei and the kinetic energy of very fast protons . These transformations take place preferably in the case of very high energies and momenta and accordingly ( from the de Broglie relation ) of very small wave-lengths . This points in the same direction as certain mathematical difficulties which appear in quantum mechanics in the limiting case of very small lengths . It is assumed that there is a lower limit to our concept of geometrical length . Single elementary particles , at rest , can not be experimentally observed . However , the tracks of individual elementary particles and atoms carrying electrical charges can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance which they have penetrated , i.e. they can tear electrons from the atoms , so that charged atom or molecule remainders ( ions ) remain . The first observations of the positions of elementary particles // were made by means of scintillations , i.e. the single flashes on a fluorescent screen which showed that charged elementary particles had hit the latter . This method of observation played a large part in the first investigations of atomic structure by Rutherford and his collaborators . In principle , the ionisation chamber is a condenser whose plates attract the positive and negative ions or the electrons produced during the passage of an ionising particle . Every time an ionising particle passes through the chamber , a small drop in potential is produced which can be read off from a highly sensitive electrometer . From the magnitude of the drop one can draw conclusions as to the nature Of great importance in all atomic physics is the Geiger counter ( see Fig. 15 ) . In its simplest form , it consists of a metal cylinder crossed axially by a taut , thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1000 V is applied between cylinder and wire . When a charged particle passes through the counter it produces ions and electrons just as in an ionisation chamber . Here the electrons in particular , because of their lightness , are + + // accelerated by the electric field in the counter , so that they repeatedly ionise the gas inside until finally an " electron avalanche " is produced which builds up within a millionth of a second , and produces a current in the wire . This build-up would lead to a glowing discharge if the latter were not immediately extinguished by means of a very high external resistance . In this manner , passages of the particles produce pulses in the counting wire , which are led to a suitable amplifier and finally can be counted by means of a loud speaker or a counter . Uncharged particles , such as light quanta and neutrons which do not ionise directly , can be counted by means of a counter surrounded by a substance in which these particles produce charged elementary particles to which the counting tube is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braked in passing through a counter but only loses an insignificant fraction of its energy , and which is further not deviated , is capable of passing through a great number of counting tubes in circuit . This enables us to determine the direction of the rays which is particularly important in studying cosmic rays ( see Chapter 1 ) . A number of counters are placed in a straight line behind one another ( " counter telescope " ) and one now counts the cases in which all the tubes respond simultaneously . If this happens one knows that the charged particle has passed through all of them , and hence its trajectory . By introducing different absorbing materials between the counters one can also determine the energy of the particle ( see Fig. 16 ) . // The Wilson Cloud Chamber In the Wilson cloud chamber , which is indispensable in modern atomic physics , one can observe the trajectories of single particles and their inter-action with the material through which they have passed ( see Fig. 17 ) . It contains a gas saturated with vapour ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gas is suddenly expanded by rapidly moving the piston forming the bottom of the vessel , and , because of this expansion and the consequent cooling , the vapour becomes super-saturated . In this condition , it tends to condense into drops . Such drops are most easily formed when ions are present , which can serve as condensation nuclei . If a charged particle has been shot through the chamber just before the moment of expansion , the drop formation takes place along its trajectory where the ions have been produced . With side illumination , fine traces of mist can be seen through the upper glass plate against the black background ( piston cover ) , and thus the trajectory of the particle shot through the chamber is made visible ( see Plate 5 ) . From the density of the track we can draw conclusions as to the nature of the particle which has caused its appearance . If a strong magnetic field is introduced into the cloud chamber then the trajectories of the particles are deviated according to the velocity of the particles ( and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the sign of the charge . As in a cloud chamber the tracks of the charged particles can be investigated on specially designed photographic plates which will show them as a sequence of blackened grains . Recently this method has been used most advantageously for recording rare transformations , especially those due to cosmic rays , and has led to the discovery that there exist more than one kind of meson ( Powell ) . Chapter II ATOMIC NUCLEI AND COSMIC RAYS BECAUSE of the small size of atoms , direct observation of their structure is as yet impossible , even with the aid of the electronmicroscope . We must therefore refer to the indirect manifestations of the atom which can be perceived with the senses , and investigate its structure by means of suitable probes shot into the atom as projectiles . We use projectiles which are themselves of atomic or sub-atomic dimensions , i.e. elementary particles . Naturally , these tiny projectiles can not be directed individually , but if a great number of them are used , it is probable that some will score a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , when during the bombardment of a piece of matter , particles are ejected that differ from the bombarding particles , or when the matter becomes radio-active for quite some time . The yield is unfortunately comparable to the result of peppering a big railway station with machine gun bullets in order to kill a single fly . Atomic Projectiles and Structure of the Atomic Nuclei Our first information on the structure of the atom was obtained by observing the passage of elementary particles through matter : electrons , originating from cathode-ray tubes served as projectiles in the investigations , and Lenard was able to conclude that " the truly impenetrable substance contained in a platinum cube of side one metre is not greater than the head of a pin " . Rutherford and his collaborators used positively charged radio-active a-particles , of which we shall speak below , as projectiles and concluded from the scattering produced when they passed through thin sheets of material , that electrostatic forces were acting between the scattering centres and the a-particles . From these results Rutherford concluded that the entire inertial mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diameter of approximately 10-12 cm and around which electrons revolved at a " great " distance ( 10-8 cm ) . 111 // The chief sources leading to an understanding of the structure of the electron shells of the atom were the spectra of emitted and absorbed light . Light emission and absorption happen in nature constantly , and without human interference . Heat , light and chemical transformation impart to the electron shell energy of an order of magnitude roughly corresponding to the energy differences between the possible electron orbits in the Bohr model . Thus experiments investigating the atomic shell are directed more towards the analysis and clear representation of the phenomena , than towards their production . Matters are different in the atomic nucleus . For the transformation of an atomic nucleus energies are needed which are approximately a million times as great as those produced in the atomic shells . Such concentrations are not found under the normal conditions on earth . It is for this reason that atomic nuclei are generally completely unchanged by external influences such as heat , pressure , light and chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic nucleus were obtained by means of radio-activity . Some of the elements , especially the heavy ones , have the property of decaying spontaneously without any external energy being imparted to them . They emit either a-particles which prove to be doubly charged positive helium atoms , i.e. nuclei of helium atoms without the two shell electrons , or very fast electrons known as fl-rays . Since these particles originate in the nucleus , their emission results in a change of the nuclear charge and ? since the chemical properties are determined by the charge on the atomic nucleus ? a transformation of one kind of atom into another ( transmutation of elements ) . Together with the emission of a or /3 particles we can generally observe very energetic electromagnetic radiations , i.e. of very short wave-length according to Planck 's relation : the y-rays . We shall have more to say in the following section about the processes involved in radio-active transformations . We obtain a more fundamental knowledge of the structure and the construction of the atomic nuclei through the action of projectiles on the atomic nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutherford in 1919 at Manchester . He found that protons were produced when nitrogen atoms // were bombarded with a-particles . His investigations showed that the protons , i.e. the hydrogen nuclei , were probably basic units of all atomic nuclei . From experiments some ten years later on the bombardment of beryllium with a-particles , further new particles were discovered , which Chadwick called neutrons . These too , were considered as basic units of the nuclei . Today we know that every atomic nucleus is , in fact , built up of protons and neutrons . Both particles are approximately of equal weight . The proton ( Greek ? the first ) has a positive electric charge , the neutron is electrically neutral . Both are given the generic name of nucleons . The number of protons in a nucleus defines , as we have explained on page loo if. , the chemical nature of the element . However , different numbers of neutrons can be associated with a given number of protons . The number of neutrons can be obtained from the total mass of the atomic nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleons apart from correction which we shall soon discuss . In other words , most elements have numerous isotopes : nuclei of different total mass . For instance , apart from ordinary , or light , hydrogen the nucleus of which is simply a proton , there exists heavy hydrogen , the nucleus of which , the deuteron ( Greek ? the second ) , contains a neutron as well as a proton . When heavy hydrogen combines with oxygen , " heavy water " is obtained . If the hydrogen nucleus contains two neutrons as well as the proton , we have tritium , hydrogen which is still heavier . The atomic number ( i.e. the number of protons equal to the number of electrons in the atomic shell ) is often added to the chemical symbol of the element as a subscript , and the total number of nucleons ( which is essentially the atomic weight in chemical calculations ) as a superscript : 1H1 is an atom of hydrogen with one proton ; 8016 is an atom of oxygen with eight protons and eight neutrons , i.e. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass Defect The force keeping the atomic nucleus together is so great that according to Einstein 's equivalence relation of energy and mass , it could be weighed . In fact , it makes itself known as a diminution of the mass of the atomic nucleus : the " mass // defect " . This can be understood as follows : let us consider that the eight protons and the eight neutrons , which together constitute the nucleus of oxygen , are at a large distance from one another . If we bring them closer , attractive forces come into play , for the nucleus is kept together by such forces . The particles would thus be accelerated towards one another , so that the potential energy of the nuclear forces is changed into kinetic energy . For the particles to stay together , this energy must somehow be given out for instance , as electro-magnetic y radiation . This amount of energy is now lacking in the atomic nucleus ; it is precisely the amount of energy which would have to be supplied to separate it again into its parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of its particles by an amount equivalent to this energy according to Einstein 's equation . This mass defect can easily be determined , and is approximately I per cent of the mass of the nucleus . The same defect of mass or energy can also be expressed in electron-volts ( eV ) . One electron-volt is the energy of an electron , or any other particle having one elementary charge , when it is accelerated from rest by a potential of one volt . The energies of chemical reactions produced by changes in the atomic shells are of an order of magnitude of one electron volt , and sometimes ( for instance , for many organic compounds ) only a fraction of this . The energy , however , with which a single proton or neutron is bound to the nucleus is six to eight million electron volts : in order , therefore , to free the nucleons from the nucleus this same very great amount of energy must be imparted to the latter , and this is best done by means of atomic bombardment . Radio-active a-particles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five million electron volts , are thus very suitable probes for the investigation of the atomic nucleus . They have the disadvantage that generally only one in about a million particles hits the atomic nucleus . The others are lost in passing through the atomic shells , for they impart their energy to the shell electrons . When the energies are too small , the a-particles can not come near enough to the nucleus , since they are repelled by the equal charge on the latter . Protons and deuterons of large energies comparable to those of radio-active a-particles can be produced in gasATOMIC // discharge tubes with intensities far surpassing that of radioactive rays . Those hydrogen nuclei contained in the positive ( glow ) column which have lost their electrons through the discharge are accelerated to the cathode as a result of their positive charge , and are led away through a hole in the cathode ( canal rays ) . They are then further accelerated by a correspondingly high potential , until they possess energies of some million electron volts . In the following section we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radium emits approximately forty million a-particles per second , an artificial proton stream of only one-millionth of an ampere is equivalent to about six billion particles in the same time . However , a-particles , protons and deuterons can only penetrate and transform the nuclei of light , or at most of medium atoms ; the heavy atomic nucleus can not be reached with them . It was therefore desirable , in the bombardment of nuclei , to make use of the neutrons produced from some nuclear reaction . These , being electrically neutral , can penetrate even the heaviest of nuclei without difficulty . Neutrons of weak intensity can be obtained from nuclear transformations , for instance by bringing beryllium powder into contact with radium in a glass tube . Greater neutron intensities are produced in the " neutron generator " in which , for instance , artificially accelerated deuterons produce neutrons through the bombardment of lithium . A further possibility of effecting nuclear changes is by means of y-radiation . For instance , the deuteron can be split into a proton and a neutron by a y-quantum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nuclear transformation possibilities , in which the individual basic units of the nucleus remain themselves unchanged . Particle-Accelerators To produce elementary particles with an energy of some million electron volts the particles must be accelerated by a correspondingly high potential . This was first achieved in a high-tension apparatus with a Greinacher-circuit . By means of a transformer , there is set up an alternating potential of a few hundred thousand volts , and this is fed by a suitable D.C. transformer to two chains of condensers in series ( see Fig. 18 ) . The total potential is the sum of the potentials of the single condensers . The potentials so far produced with this arrangement are between one and three million volts . The high-tension generator of van de Graaff ( see Fig. 19 ) is based on the principle of the induction machine . Inside a large metal sphere an endless belt of insulating material passes over two pulleys with their axes of parallel to each other so that the belt travels in a horizontal A plane . charge is communicated to the belt by spraying positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the belt to the interior of a hollow electrode where a high difference of potential is developed between the electrode and the earth . On principle , this could be increased ad infinitum , if an upper limit were not set by the dimensions of the space in which the apparatus is contained . Above a certain potential there will be a spark to the walls and the floor , and thus the conductor will become discharged . Potentials of approximately three million volts may be produced with such apparatus . With high-tension equipment giving potentials of one million to a maximum of five million volts , protons , deuterons and a-particles can be given velocities of an order of magnitude // comparable with the speed of particles emitted during radioactive transformations . Particles accelerated in this hightension apparatus can therefore interact only with elementary particles and atoms or atomic nuclei , just as is the case with radio-active rays . This procedure , however , has the great advantage that it enables us to investigate the interaction of matter with protons , deuterons and neutrons , i.e. particles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected from theoretical considerations that particles having an energy of about ten to a hundred times that of radio-active particles would produce very different effects , from those accelerated by means of the Greinacher or van de Graaff apparatus . By means of more strongly accelerated particles it was especially hoped to produce nuclear fission and fragmentation , and also artificial mesons which had previously only been observed in high frequency radiation . The Cyclotron paratus for the acceleration of particles to higher energies is the cyclotron , in which the particles are exposed to numerous successive , moderate potentials , and are thus brought to velocities corresponding to particle energies of some hundred million electron volts . In this , use is made of the fact that a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field has a circular orbit due to the lateral force of the magnetic field : the greater the circle , the faster the particle . The time that the particle takes for one revolution does not depend on its velocity . A fast particle describes a large circle in the same time that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution is determined only by the strength of the magnetic field and by the specific electric charge of the particle . // If we now combine the magnetic field , which would always bring the particle back to the same place after the same period of time , with an alternating electric field , the latter will always accelerate the particles in the same direction at the end of each revolution . This is used technically in the following manner : the accelerated particles are created or introduced between two flat , semi-circular containers , the " dees " ( see Fig. 20 ) . The plane sections of the dees facing each other carry two electrodes to which a high frequency alternating potential is applied , by means of a strong short-wave transmitter with a peak potential of about 30,000 to 100 , 000 volts , and a frequency of about ten million oscillations per second . The dees are placed in a very strong constant magnetic field . Each half period , the charged particles are pulled into one of the containers , the trajectory inside which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency of the applied alternating field is chosen so that the particles , after describing one semi-circle , enter into precisely the opposite field at the slit between the two dees , and are thus accelerated still further in the opposite direction . Corresponding to its now greater energy , the particle describes a larger circle in the unchanged magnetic field in the same time . When the particle returns to the slit once more , it again finds an accelerating field , because of the chosen frequency of the alternating field . This process is repeated a few hundred times in the cyclotron so that the trajectory of the particles is made up of orbits of ever-increasing diameters , so forming a spiral of several hundred turns . At the edge of the container the beam of particles is displaced by an additional electrical field and // directed wherever we wish to work with it . In large cyclotrons it is possible to produce particles with an energy of about woo million electron volts . The velocities of particles with these great energies are already a significant fraction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of the particles on their velocity is appreciable . With increasing particle mass , however , the increase in velocity due to the electric field becomes less than would be the case with a fixed particle mass , so that at these great velocities the particles would no longer pass between the electrodes in phase with the alternating field , and the arrangement would cease to function . Thus an upper limit is set to the possible particle energies produced in cyclotrons . This limit , however , can be extended by lowering the applied frequency for the external trajectories to compensate the increase in mass . This is done in the synchro-cyclotron by making use of frequency modulation . By means of the cyclotron , protons , deuterons and aparticles can be accelerated . The acceleration of electrons can not be satisfactorily carried out in the cyclotron . Since the electrons have a very small mass , the accelerating field would impart to them so great a velocity that the frequency would have to be far greater than for the acceleration of the other elementary particles and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even today . Furthermore , the mass of the electrons is considerably increased since their velocity would approach that of light , so that the effects mentioned above apply to the electrons particularly , and the accelerating action of cyclotrons on electrons would normally cease , even at relatively small particle energies . The Betatron In the betatron ( see Fig. 21 ) , which is also called the electron-catapult , electrons can be brought to energies as great as those of heavy particles accelerated in the cyclotron . The principle on which the betatron works is the formation of a circular electric field in a magnetic field changing with time . This principle is also used in the case of the transformer . The electrons move in a tube replacing the transformer winding , and in one revolution they will be accelerated by an electrical // potential equivalent to the voltage , that would be produced in the winding of the secondary spool of a transformer . On account of the increasing velocity of the particles a constantly increasing magnetic field is required to maintain the required circular motion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic field that produces the accelerating electrical potential . An acceleration of electrons up to energies of some hundred million electron volts can also be produced in the synchrotron , which apparatus is a combination of the cyclotron and the betatron . Just as in the case of the cyclotron , the acceleration of the particles is produced between two electrodes . The particles are kept on the same fixed orbits by means of a magnetic field increasing with time and corresponding to their increase in velocity . The linear accelerator works without a magnetic field . Pre-accelerated particles ( electrons and heavy particles ) enter a tube some meters long , in which they are exposed to accelerating electric fields which act upon a particle just at that instant at which it enters the position of action . Technically this effect is produced by means of a travelling electric wave which , in practice , runs with the particle and always produces an electrical field at the position of the particle in such a way that the particle is constantly accelerated . Nuclear Transformations We must now pose the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only do in a roundabout way , namely by talking about the transformations of atomic nuclei . We can
