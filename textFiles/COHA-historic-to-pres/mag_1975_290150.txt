" It 's the death knell of the city , " predicts Boston City Council Member Louise Day Hicks . " People will not comply , " says State Senator William Bulger . " They will leave the city . " From Hyde Park to South Boston the doomsayers were in full cry last week , and their bombast was directed at Federal District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity . In a 104-page court order , Garrity produced his final plan for desegregating the city 's troubled schools-a decision that promises , at the least , to keep Boston in turmoil for months to come . <P> Garrity 's new plan supersedes a temporary one that he had ordered the Boston School Committee to put into effect last fall . That order led to school boycotts by whites , unruly demonstrations , occasional bloodshed and massive use of police . At first glance , it appears likely that Garrity 's Phase Two scheme will spawn more of the same . The plan calls for the busing of approximately 21,000 students , 3,000 more than in Phase One . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bused be children in Grades 1 through 5 ; only 3,000 students in those grades were bused this year . Garrity says that he hopes to limit the length of the trips to an average often to 15 minutes . For that reason he has ruled out busing for one potential trouble spot : predominantly white East Boston , which is separated from the rest of the city by Boston Harbor . <P> Garrity 's aim is to bus enough students to ensure that the racial mixture at most Boston public schools conforms more or less to the city wide ratio of 51% white , 37% black and 12% other minorities . To help achieve that goal , he has ordered 20 schools to close their doors and has created nine new school districts . One of the districts will consist of 22 " magnet " schools spread throughout the city . The magnet schools , open to any Boston children as long as their enrollment conforms to citywide racial ratios , are designed to encourage voluntary desegregation by offering specialized courses that will attract students from other neighborhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but many whites were enraged . During a hearing last week in Judge Garrity 's courtroom , hundreds of R.O.A.R . ( Restore Our Alienated Rights ) members wearing STOP BUSING buttons and waving American flags demonstrated noisily outside . Inside the courtroom , Garrity was hissed as he questioned two R.O.A.R . leaders about their part in a demonstration the week before outside South Boston High School . As the hearing ended , one spectator complained ( loud enough for Garrity to hear ) : " The guy 's sick , that 's all , sick . " <P> New Schools . Some whites , resigned to the inevitability of public school integration , are making plans to educate their children elsewhere . Says Helen Barrett , whose son will start school in September , " We may just go to Ireland for a couple of years . " Ed King of West Roxbury has another solution . " We 'll start our own schools , " he says . Indeed , some white students are already attending new private schools .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
