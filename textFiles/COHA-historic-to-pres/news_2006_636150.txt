Muslim fundamentalists are n't shy about naming their enemies . They 've identified Zionists and secularists as particular foes of Islam ; picked out apostates , Americans , and Jews for scorn ; disparaged " crusaders " and imperialists , and even  --  like conspiracists everywhere  --  warned against the Freemasons . <p> But Islamists have selected one enemy that 's entirely baffling : Rotary clubs . <p> For instance , this appears in Article 17 of the Hamas charter : <p> " Therefore , you can see the enemies making consistent efforts by way of publicity and movies , curriculi of education and culture , using as their intermediaries their craftsmen who are part of the various Zionist Organizations which take on all sorts of names and shapes such as : the Free Masons , Rotary Clubs , gangs of spies and the like . All of them are nests of saboteurs and sabotage .

Colonialism and its followers , the apostate rulers , then started to openly erect crusader centers , societies and organizations like Masonic Lodges , Lions and Rotary Clubs . " <p> Dark references to the Rotarian conspiracy against Islam can be found in Turkey 's Islamist paper Vakit ; Egypt 's weekly Aqidati and the government daily Al-Ahram ; the Palestinian paper Al-Hayat Al-Jadida , and even Saudi high-school textbooks ( " Rotary is among the destructive organizations that were most dangerous to Islam and the Muslims " ) . In the 1970s , Egypt 's highest religious official , the Shaikh of al-Azhar ( an Islamic institution comprising a mosque and a university ) , reportedly issued a fatwa forbidding Muslims to join Rotary clubs . And while these examples all stem from Sunni fundamentalism , Rotary clubs also show up in old speeches of Ayatollah Khomeini . <p> For Americans , of course , this seems slightly comic . Rotary clubs ? Are n't they like the Elks , except less edgy ? But the roots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangled history of Western influence in the Middle East . <p> Story begins in Chicago <p> Our story begins with the formation of the first Rotary club in Chicago in 1905 . Originally conceived as a social club for its four founding businessmen , the club soon expanded and became focused on community service . One of its initial projects was the construction of Chicago 's first public bathroom . The name came from the club 's practice of rotating meetings among members ' workplaces . <p> Over the next several years , clubs were chartered in San Francisco , Oakland , Los Angeles , Seattle and New York . By 1910 , there were enough members to hold a national convention . In 1912 , the first overseas Rotary club was formed in England . And by 1925 , what had come to be called Rotary International had more than 200 clubs on six continents , 20,000 members , and a charitable ethos that led Albert Schweitzer to join . ( Among many other activities , Rotary has since been involved in the founding of UNESCO and the near-eradication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused outsiders believed that Rotary clubs were a branch of the Freemasons . While this was n't true , it also was n't made up out of whole cloth : At least one and perhaps two of the first four Rotarians were Masons , and until the practice was banned , some early Rotary clubs accepted only Masons as members . <p> This supposed Mason-Rotarian connection ensnared the Rotarians in the conspiracy theories and suspicions that long plagued the Masons . The Masons first appeared in the early 1700s in England , and by 1798 a British author published Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe , Carried On in the Secret Meetings of Free Masons , Illuminati and Reading Societies . The book 's thesis was just what it sounds like : Masons , fired with Enlightenment fervor , were secretly planning the overthrow of the entire established order ( hence , perhaps , the American and French revolutions ) . <p> The suspicion of Masons grew through the 1800s ( President Millard Fillmore was first elected to Congress as a candidate of the Anti-Masonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . While almost no one remembers this now , The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is n't about a Jewish plot to control mankind  --  it 's about a Jewish-Masonic plot . Hitler spoke of a Jewish-Bolshevik-Masonic conspiracy . And Reinhard Heydrich created a special section of the SS to extirpate Masonic influence in Germany . <p> Similar views on masonry were held ( in less virulent forms ) by conservative elements of the Catholic Church . And as Rotary clubs spread , the church lumped them with the Masons . In 1928 , several Spanish bishops declared that Rotary was " nothing else but a new satanic organization with the same background and teachings of masonry " and deemed it " a suspected organization " that " should be considered as execrable and perverse . " Soon afterward , the Vatican decreed that Catholic priests could not join Rotary clubs . <p> This chill lasted for a surprisingly long time . Dan Mooers , former chairman of Rotary International 's Executive Committee , recalls Rotary being denounced from the pulpit as late as 1970 . The relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Pope John Paul II publicly endorsed Rotary 's humanitarian projects . <p> Borrowed conspiracy theories <p> But what does this have to do with Islamic fundamentalism ? The answer seems to be conspiracy gridlock : For years , fundamentalist Islam has borrowed wholesale from European conspiracist cosmology . Ever since Protocols of the Elders of Zion was first translated into Arabic , it 's provided a handy explanation  --  Masons and all  --  for the Western menace to the Islamic community . ( In Iraq , Moqtada al-Sadr 's paper Al Hawza published a picture of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton and explained that their hand gestures were a sign of the Zionist-Masonic conspiracy . ) And , like the Catholic Church , Islamists lumped Rotarians in with the Masons and called both anathema . <p> It 's tempting to leave it there in the realm of pure conspiracy , but that actually is n't the whole story . In fact , Masons were involved in the European efforts to control the Middle East , efforts that helped spur anti-Western Islamist sentiment . <p> Masonry provided an opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen to open lodges overseas and then invite their local counterparts to join . Generally speaking , neither the European nor the Middle Eastern businessmen were what you might call populists . Berkeley 's Hamid Algar , one of the world 's preeminent scholars of Islamic history , explains that Freemasonry : <p> " . . . has generally functioned since its first appearance in the Muslim world in the late 18th century as a channel for the promotion of Western dominance , politically and ideologically ; one Istanbul lodge in the mid-19th century had the British ambassador as its grand master and the Ottoman chief vizier as one of his initiates . Visiting dignitaries from Iran and the Ottoman Empire would regularly be initiated by their hosts on their visits to London and Paris . <p> Of course , none of this means that Masons ( or Rotarians ) played a particularly important role in colonialism 's history ; British and French power surely owed much more to money and guns than the Ancient Scottish Rite . Nevertheless , it 's a natural human tendency to believe that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade people that while there may be secret forces , they are engineering very little . <p> View limits Rotarian good works <p> Where does all this leave Rotary clubs in the Islamic world today ? It 's a mixed picture . While it may be because of general anti-Western sentiment rather than specific fears of Rotarian menace , Rotary has had trouble operating in some Muslim areas . Several years ago , the polio eradication campaign led by Rotary ran into resistance in Muslim regions of Nigeria amid rumors that the vaccine would sterilize children . And Rotary has no outposts in much of the Middle East , including Saudi Arabia , Iran , Syria and Iraq . <p> At the same time , Rotary is quietly thriving in parts of the Islamic world . There are about 100 chapters in Indonesia , more than 80 chapters in Turkey , 70 in Egypt , 20 in Lebanon and even one in Dubai . Indeed , in some quarters Rotary is perceived just as it is here . <p> As one youthful Cairo blogger reports : " They seem nice enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( See microfilm for photo description ) .
