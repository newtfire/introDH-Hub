THE PRESIDENCY/HUGH SIDEY <P> A while back New York Congressman Jonathan Bingham slipped Jimmy Carter a 414-page book , saying that he wanted Carter to have it even though he knew he was too busy to read it right away . The book , Courage to Change : An Introduction to the Life and Thought of Reinhold Niebuhr , was by Bingham 's wife June . Carter fixed his determined gaze on Bingham and replied , " I shall read it within the month . " <P> Within the month Carter ran into the Binghams in Washington and reported : " I have only three chapters to go and I have been underlining . " Now he is finished . <P> It is one of the comments on this political year that finding a candidate who carves out time for books is such a unique experience . Carter had to slow his pace of three books a week to win the Democratic nomination . But during his interlude in Plains , while waiting for his opponent to be chosen , he resumed his regular pace . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . He went through a biography of Teddy Roosevelt , a President he admires . He read Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream by Doris Kearns and eagerly welcomed the author a few weeks later when she came to interview him . Recently Carter polished off General Maxwell Taylor 's new book on national defense , Precarious Security . He is savoring Justice and Mercy , a collection of Niebuhr 's sermons , addresses and prayers that was sent to him by the theologian 's widow . <P> Besides books , Carter sometimes samples as many as ten newspapers a day , six from his Southern region and three or four from beyond . He has a clipping service that goes through six to eight other papers around the country and dips into scores of magazines every month . <P> All men in pursuit of power follow the news . But book reading is something special . Teddy Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman were three who indulged . John Kennedy could speed-read 1,200 words a minute , so he was able to continue consuming books even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course but claims no records ; yet he fully intends to keep up with important books should he win the November election , though campaigning will slow his consumption until then . <P> The most important book in his life is , of course , the Bible . Another that had profound impact was James Agee 's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men . The book Reinhold Niebuhr on Politics was important in developing his attitude toward public life . <P> As a boy he was urged to read Tolstoy 's War and Peace . He was disappointed when he found it was not about cowboys and Indians , but he stuck with it nonetheless . He has read the book two or three times and counts it as one of his favorites . He was deeply moved by Sandburg 's volumes on Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin 's Autobiography . <P> A few days ago , Carter plucked out Bertrand Russell 's A History of Western Philosophy . He handled it gently , like an old friend , opening the worn pages carefully and glancing at familiar lines . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .
