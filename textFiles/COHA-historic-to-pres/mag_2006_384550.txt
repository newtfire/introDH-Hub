LINDA CARROLL 'S unorthodox relationship with her famous mother and infamous daughter forced her to reevaluate love , loss and the control we have over the people we most want to protect . Photograph Photograph // THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP MORE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED THAN THAT BETWEEN mother and child . The gravitational pull defies space , time and logic and persists in the wake of estrangement , rejection and worse . Every human bumps up against these bonds , but few have grappled with them as directly as Linda Carroll , a 62-year-old therapist in Corvallis , Oregon . Carroll , the mother of five children , struggled with her firstborn , the notorious rock **25;2168;TOOLONG Courtney Love , whose erratic behavior and outsize persona have made headlines for years . Linda emancipated Courtney at age 16 , and the two are now estranged . When Courtney had a daughter in 1992 , Linda began a search for her own mother , the woman who gave her up at birth . The quest led to Paula Fox , acclaimed writer and a National Book Award winner . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painful dissolution of her relationship with Courtney and her improbable reunion with Paula . Carroll spoke to Psychology Today about ambiguity in relationships and the myth of closure . Photograph BABY LOVE : Courtney 's first birthday , July 9 , 1965. // PT : Your book is about your famous daughter and your famous mother . Why ? LC : I wrote abook about me and looking for my roots . I found that the roots were inside me . It 's my struggle to understand . My daughter Courtney has struggled with alcohol and drugs and mental illness and celebrity . It is a lethal combination , and she continues to do damage . The question is , how do you go on with your life ? How do you mourn the living ? You learned to live with ambiguity . You talk about Courtney and her inconsolability when upset even as an Infant I took Courtney to a therapist when she was 2 . I felt something was wrong . There were times she would cry for hours and could n't be soothed . Other times she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would study people and then do it . The first therapist I consulted said , " I do n't know what 's wrong . But I have a feeling it 's going to get worse , and there 's not anything we can do . " I have been grateful all my life for him . For admitting that he does n't have any answers and he 's not going to blame you ? He was an intern ; he had n't yet learned that he knew everything . When she was 14 , we went to a therapist who also said she may get worse . All the rest said , " It 's you . " And I believed that . You lived a chaotic lifestyle with many moves and several marriages . Besides Courtney , I have two other daughters by my second husband and two sons by a third husband . The four children are really close . The two girls did a lot of moving back and forth as children , and they are all so worldly . They say it was hard but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth husband , of 17 years , my selection process in men was bad People always talk about the negative effect of divorce on kids , but they do n't talk about how children might be better off not being raised by a disturbed father . A therapist once said to me , " Your problem is not getting divorced , it 's getting married . The fact that you got out is really healthy ; you finally got your act together . " In Courtney 's childhood , when did you stop blaming yourself for her behavior ? When she was about 8 and I became the brunt of her rage . Something in me shifted then . One time , years later , I was visiting Courtney 's daughter , Frances , at their home in Beverly Hills , and Courtney was horribly cruel to the people who worked for her . I felt deep shame and asked myself what I must have done to her for her to do that to them . I went to my own therapist and cried . I was trying to show myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I know that I 'm not making her make those choices and that I did n't make her bipolar . What I did do was give in to her . I was so scared of her anger that I indulged her , and I taught her really young that if she screams , she could get her own way . But I did not make her a seriously character-disordered person . You have had to deal with heartache as a parent . You 've faced existential Issues . And then there 's the fact that it Is all done on a big public stage . Was that an undertone with Courtney growing up , what other people thought ? No . But it started to be when she was in juvenile detention and I was training to become a counselor . On Sundays I would drive with my daughters Nicole and Jaimee to see her in detention , where she 'd busted a door and knocked someone 's teeth out She was 15 or 16 . That was so mortifying , I did n't talk about it I was becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and then I have this kid who is in prison . When did you last speak with Courtney ? About six years ago . She was cleaning up her act , practicing Buddhism . She was dating the actor Edward Norton-she was sort of his project We had some conversations . She made some generous gifts of money to me and to her half-brothers : paid for a year of their college . But she became enraged when she found out one of her siblings had n't listened to her new album as soon as it came out . That was the end . Have you achieved closure in this relationship ? Closure is the worst term in our culture . I do n't think there 's such a thing as closure . I think of people who have experienced the death of a loved one by murder and are waiting for the murderer to be executed . They say things like , " Well , then there can be closure . " Closure is a human fantasy . We live with open wounds . We live with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only place where choice exists is how I deal with something that happened . I can also take steps to reduce the chances of something happening . But our culture emphasizes the idea that we have control over all sorts of things that we do n't . We do n't have power or control over other people 's lives . When you havea child or a family member whose behavior or mental condition or life story is really painful to observe , it just exaggerates how powerless we are . There 's an ultimate existential moment , which I see as a marriage counselor , where marriages really begin either to die or to get healthy . It 's when two people say , " I can not change you . Either I accept this or I get out . " That 's an excellent analogy , accepting people for who they are , no matter how flawed . With a baby , it 's like falling in love . You think , " I 'll keep you safe , you 'll have everything I did n't , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shows up who has her path of destiny and her life . We make children better or worse , but we do n't make them . Clearly in Courtney 's childhood you were holding out hope for change . At what point did you realize you could not fundamentally alter the course of her life ? It happens all the time . It happened last week . I got a letter on my Web site for Her Mother 's Daughter that I knew was from Courtney , written at 4:38 A.M. It said , " You 're a terrible mother , no wonder your baby died . " But when I first saw her letter , I thought , maybe some part of her is able to engage at some other level . You 're telling yourself that maybe this time it 'll be different . Courtney does n't cook , drive or have relationships . One hundred years ago , she would have been institutionalized . So much of Hollywood is based on people like that . One day two years ago , Frances was staying with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a television on . The announcer said , " After the break , we 'll tell you what ex-rock star was running naked through the hallway . " I grabbed Frances and said , " We 've got to go , sweetie , I just remembered I have an appointment . " In the car , she said , " Grandma , I know that 's Mommy . And if you do n't tell me , I 'll have to look on the Internet . " That night her manager called my daughter Nicole and said they 'd just taken her to Bellevue Hospital , nobody there cares what happens to her , and if someone from her family does n't come , they 're going to really throw away the key . Nicole called me and said , " We have to go . " I said , " But you know what she 'll do , " and Nicole said , " It does n't matter . That 's her karma . Our karma is we have to show up for her . " There 's something I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't even have sentimental feelings for her anymore , but I would give her my kidney . I can see the National Enquirer , " Courtney Love 's mother admits she does n't love her . " But love is an ongoing relationship . The sum of all the work I have done has gone from " Maybe I can fix it " to " I 'm not going to show up " to " I 'm going to show up because it 's right , but I 'm going to have a good time in New York when I go , because most likely she wo n't have anything to do with me and she 'll twist it . " But there 's always something that can happen with a human being . So I went . And she said something like , " My mother 's trying to have me committed . " How do you deal with this open wound ? You just work with it . You build your own life . I can not change her . What I can change is me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to fix her ? No . What are my expectations ? Will she let me be a resource for her ? Probably not . She 'll probably say I 'm there to lock her up . I go because it is the right thing to do . I 'm showing up , but with a clear expectation of what 's possible . I have to do that because my instincts and the likely outcome are at odds . There 's a belief about our own omnipotence as mothers . My other four kids are fabulous humans and I would think to myself , " How did they get that way ? " Then I would think about Courtney , " How did I screw up so badly ? What did I do ? " One day , I was astounded to realize that while I could not take credit for the way my children have done well , I took all the blame for the child who has troubles . Photograph HALLOWEEN GRUNGE : Seven-year-old Courtney inaugurates the look she 'd later make famous . Photograph A YOUNG WRITER : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late 1940s. // Has your work as a counselor helped you handle this ? I 've drawn more insights from Courtney and from three bad marriages to people I should never have been with . I started with a lot of arrogance . Dealing with Courtney has been good for me as a human being . Having a child or family member that is lost to drugs or alcohol or mental illness or celebrity , or all of them , teaches you about helplessness . How do we react in the face of helplessness ? Depression is one common reaction . But that 's a way of not choosing-I deliberately use the word " choosing " - an active path out of it , a learned helplessness . One thing that distinguishes us as Americans is a grandiose optimism that we 're in control of our lives . I drew tremendous insight from the opening line of M. Scott Peck 's book The Road Less Traveled : " Life is hard . " When you 're dealing with an open wound in the family , you have to enrich your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Along comes the paradigm-busting child and you have to rethink everything you thought you knew . That 's hard as parents . Do I take all the responsibility for the good choices my kids make when they 're adults ? That 's a light narcissism . But it 's a black narcissism to think that I make Courtney behave the way she does at 42 . Maybe some of her success is due to the fact that I did n't give up on her a lot earlier or force her into a mold or give her electric shock treatments . One thing that helped me was the day my youngest son said , " Mom , you have no context to understand Courtney ; she is not of your world . She cares about power , and it 's all about who is more powerful than whom . You care about things like connection and good will , and she hates those things . Anything to do with human kindness enrages her . And she thinks you 're a total wimp . " How have you been disabused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Courtney was my greatest teacher about that . With my other kids , I still have some illusion ; once in awhile , they call and ask what I think about something . But with Courtney , there 's never been control . I 've never been able to soothe her . I was never able to find a school or a therapist or a friend or a life that in any way worked for her . I never understood her music . I do n't understand how to be her mother or how to support her . I know what to get my other kids for their birthday that they 're going to love . But Courtney is foreign to me . To have a child and not know how to comfort her , it 's just been so painful to see her making such a mass of fuck-ups . Those words are n't big enough to describe it That 's where I 've learned that I am not in charge . And then when she had a child , I knew I was n't going to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life . It 's popular today for parents to believe that they control how their kids turn out . The truth is that some of the darkest paths we walk give us the greatest gifts . If we let them have a bad fourth-grade teacher and teach them how to live with the teacher rather than change schools , then they have a little skill when they have to work for someone who 's an asshole . I took Courtney to therapy when I was living in New Zealand ; she was an insomniac . I was mad at her , and I feel so bad about that ; I 'd say to her , " If you 'd just sleep at night . " But she could n't , and it was horrible . They gave her sedatives at 10 years old . And Kurt Cobain , who had ongoing stomach trouble and scoliosis and could n't sleep , was also given sedatives at age 10 . The drugcouple of the world and both were put on drugs at 10 . But what do parents do when there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one child ? The limits of my mothering were acutely brought home to me with this child . You grew up adopted and when your first grandchild Frances Bean Cobain was born , you began searching for your mother . I grew up in the 1940s . People believed then that any baby could become a part of any family , that we were a tabula rasa ; you just got a blank baby and filled it in . My parents told me , " When you were 10 days old , we brought you home from the hospital . " I knew something happened during those 10 days , but it was never talked about . I was always listening behind doors for some clue . When you grow up with secrets , the secret becomes bigger than what 's there . The 10 days became an enormous truth about my life that got bigger and bigger . **27;2195;TOOLONG Betty Jean Lifton has said that every child who is adopted knows that to be adopted means that you had to be unadopted first . But nobody ever talked about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care what people say , I care what they do n't say . " One reason I became a therapist was to hear what really went on with people . Did you ever find out ? There was another dynamic , which I found out in bits , finally , from my birth mother , Paula , when I met her . My parents had been given a baby boy the year before I came , and after several months , his mother changed her mind and took him back . My adoptive mother was devastated . My father went to the up-and-coming gynecologist in town and said , " Get her another baby and make sure the mother does n't come and get her . " When Paula got pregnant at 19 and told the doctor she did n't know what to do , he insisted she give the baby up for adoption . Four days after I was born , she told the doctor , " This is a terrible mistake , I want my baby . " He told her , " You have signed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll have you put in jail . You have to leave San Francisco . " She had no clue about her rights . I think my adoptive parents knew that I was n't legitimately theirs . My adoptive mother was a righteous woman who , I 'm sure , was haunted by the suspicion that my mother had tried to get me back . My father knew . I know there was a veil beyond the adoption veil . Did you always have a fantasy about contacting your mother ? No . I had a fantasy about that until I was 5 . Every day I 'd see two women who walked by my house , one who looked like a movie star , one a drunk lady with shopping bags heading to the bar . I had the idea that one of them was my mother . One day the pretty one said , " Hello , sweetheart . " I knew that was her , that my mother was the queen . I told a friend down the street that my real mother was going to come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back to Luella , my adoptive mother , who was outraged . She said , " Tour real mother did n't want you , and you 're lucky to have people who do . " Then I remember just knowing that my real mother was the drunk lady . I stopped longing for her . By the time I was 11 , it became about men . I wanted one to fix me . So much in our culture still leads women to think they do n't really have a life until a guy comes along . I 'm really grateful for my marriage , but it has n't saved me from myself . When I was 30 , I decided I wanted to find my mother . Then I got really scared that she would be a homeless alcoholic and I would be embarrassed . I had made the drunk woman into my mother . But that was really a reflection of how I felt about myself : If I came from someone who did n't want me , I had to be pretty bad . I understand now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in myself and had my own sense of rootedness , because adoptees have to be prepared for anything . You ca n't approach the search with a fantasy ; you need a sense of curiosity and acceptance . By the time I did search , I was 47 and had done so much work on myself that I was ready . I was prepared for anything but what I found . Photograph HOLLYWOOD OPENING : Courtney and daughter Frances in Los Angeles , 2006. // What did you do ? I got a search expert , who found nothing . I turned to an underground system of people , and after many months , I got my real birth certificate . There was her name , " PaulaFox , " under Mother . I felt like Pinocchio turning into a real boy . It said my mother was from the South , when she was really from New York . One thing it did say was that she wanted to be a writer . Photograph FOUR TIME 'S THE CHARM : Linda with fourth husband Tim Barraud in Oregon . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm looking for someone who may have written something once . " The librarian was annoyed and said , " What 's her name ? " I said " Paula Fox . " She said , " Paula Fox ? ! She 's one of the best writers in America ! " She typed her name and the computer started exploding with pages about my mother . I felt faint . I asked , " Where can I read about her ? " She pointed me to Who 's Who . There I read from a speech she delivered when she received the Newbery Award for children 's literature : " This effort to recognize is an effort to connect ourselves with the reality of our own lives . It is painful ; but if we are to become human , we can not abandon it . Once set on that path of recognition we can not forswear our integral connections with other people . We must make our way towards them as best we can , try to find what is similar , try to understand what is dissimilar , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connect , abandon , painful . I went home inastate of delirium and wrote heravery Jack Webbish letter , just the facts : This is who I am , I found out you 're my mother , I do n't care about meeting you or want a relationship , I just want facts . Who was my father ? What happened ? Iwantto know my medical stuff . I put it in an envelope and remembered that she was turning70 and thought , " She 'll have a heart attack . " An intense feeling of caring came over me , so I put a little card atop the brown envelope . It said , " Go slow . " I sent it by FedEx . When she opened it and saw those words , she screamed up four stories to her husband , " Martin , she 's found me . " What was your first Interaction with Paula Fox ? I sent it on Tuesday . On Friday , the FedEx man delivered a package containingabrown envelope . I thought she was re turning my package . In reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You have the wrong woman ; do n't come into my life . " I looked inside and all these pictures fell out . My mother wrote : " I 'm sitting here with tears streaming down my face , and my husband of 40 years is standing behind me . Welcome into my life . " We wrote three or four times a day for three months . Tim said it was like taking a lover . Then we decided we 'd meet . We practically sent out birth announcements . You still had n't spoken on the phone ? No . It was too scary . We had decided to meet in San Francisco , the place where we 'd been separated . She 'd never gone back there even though her agent lived nearby . We went everywhere , to the house where she lived when she was pregnant I called my best friend and said , " My mother 's here . " What about your birth father ? My mother and father had stayed in contact . He lived in Los Angeles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to dinner , but they never talked about me . Immediately , she called him . He had died two months before . But I found his family . He had no children , but he had told a nephew about me . It 's a tough question , but how do you think life would have been different had Paula raised you ? I do n't think she would have become the writer she is . Becoming a writer has given her a foundation that has allowed her to live a rich , good and full life . It has filled in a lot of the holes in her life as nothing else could have . If she had kept me , it would have been a very different road for her . I 'm really grateful for the way my life has turned out . My mother felt a loss that never went away that had to add to all of her other losses . She lost her mother and she lost her daughter . And I lost my mother and I lost my daughter . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are wonderful . My life feels rich . My adoptive parents died when I was 27 , but growing up I had freedom in the world . I would n't have had that with Paula , because she had nothing behind her . I would have felt responsible for her and made very different choices . She and I have a hard time talking about this , because for her , it was the worst thing that could have happened and she regrets it every day . And I feel she could n't have done anything else , that it was a brave thing , unfortunate in the way it was done . What advice would you give to other adoptees seeking their birth mother ? You have to have a life that works , that you can turn to and drink from when the fantasy does n't pan out . Whatever those obscurations are in your life that stop you from living the life you want to be living , you 'd better deal with those before you go looking for your mother . It 's pretty awful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have the wrong woman ; never bother me again . " Somewhere tucked into the mind of every adopted adult is the idea or hope of a relationship . An adoptee has a built-in mystery , an automatic fantasy . You can go there whenever things are bad , " My real mother would ... " " It would be different if .... " You 've had to realize the ambiguity in each of your relationships . How does it feel to be sandwiched between a famous mother and a famous daughter ? I 'm not in between them . I do n't want the notoriety . I 'm not a Buddhist , but I have a lot of the Buddhist in me . It 's all fluff . It can all go in a heartbeat . I love that phrase about the ego : " One day a peacock , the next day a feather duster . " When the book was published , a review would come out : " This is such a good book . It 's so solid . It 's touching . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a writer , I have it in my blood . Then another review would say , " She ripped off her daughter . What kind of mother would do that ? The book is terrible . Who cares ? " and I 'm a feather duster . It 's up and down . I have to keep saying , Tm not this . I 'm not that . " My mother lives in that world , where she 's elevated and defeated . Courtney lives in that world much worse . She 's elevated much higher than Paula and smashed much lower . Paula is fragile , but it 's amazing how she functions . Courtney is always flung around by what 's happening . In her room are piles of magazines . What she does all day is look for herself . If she 's not in there , she 'll do something to make herself in there , because that 's how she knows she 's alive . How do you reconcile the trajectory of losing a daughter and finding a mother ? The " formula " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . Both relationships are anomalies . But both have been about learning to let go of expectations and being surprised at the outcome . I had to let go of everythingabout Courtney , including whether she lived or died and how she treats people . She 's not " mine " any more than Paula is " mine .
