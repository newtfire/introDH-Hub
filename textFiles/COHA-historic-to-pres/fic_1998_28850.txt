Skeleton Canyon Chapter One It was five o'clock on a Friday afternoon in June when Bree came into the kitchen . Even with the airconditioning going full blast , the kitchen was hot compared to the rest of the house . Sweat rolled down Mrs. Vorevkin 's jowly cheeks as she stood bent over the kitchen sink , cleaning and chopping vegetables for the salad . " I 'm ready to go . " Olga turned and smiled at the young woman whose tan , lithe , and cheerful presence never failed to brighten any room she entered . " The cool chest is in the pantry , " Olga told her . " It 's all packed . " She put down her knife and dried both hands on her apron . " The soup is ready , " she added . " You should have some before you leave . Hot soup on a hot day will cool you off . Besides , it 's such a long drive . You should eat something besides sandwiches . " Bree sniffed the air . Over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of them had n't lasted because they could n't stand up to David O'Brien 's stringent demands for quality and impeccable service . Olga , however , had been with the O'Briens a little over three years . She was an excellent cook who had come to them , by some circuitous path , from a job with the U.S. embassy in Moscow with an unexplained stop-off in New Orleans along the way . During her three years ' tenure , she had developed a very loving friendship with this bright , golden-haired young woman who stood in her kitchen , waffling with indecision . Bree glanced at her watch . Nacio , as she usually called him , would be off work in another hour . She wanted to be there in time to meet him when his shift ended , but there was just time for some of Mrs. V. 's delicious soup and a thick slab of the crusty white bread she made on a daily basis , summer and winter . " All right , " Bree agreed at last , slipping into her favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to hurry . " The soup was a clear broth with a few green slivers of scallion floating on the top . Five or six tiny homemade meat-filled dumplings sat on the bottom of the bowl . It was wonderful . " What time will Mom and Dad be home ? " Bree asked , glancing casually at her watch . She wanted to be through the security gates , off Purdy Lane , and on the highway headed for Douglas long before her parents returned . Not that it mattered that much whether or not they were home when Bree left . She was going regardless . It was just always easier for her to leave without having to face them , without having to lie to them directly . Although , with practice , even that was easier now , Brianna was getting used to it . Finishing the soup , Bree pushed her chair from the table , carried her dishes to the counter , and plucked a plump radish from the pile of clean ones Mrs. V. had stacked next to the sink . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're not very filling . " Tossing her ponytail , Bree took a second radish and then hurried to the pantry . The cooler was right there , just as she had known it would be , packed with sandwiches , sodas , fruit , and , most likely , some little dessert surprise as well . Mrs. V. was a great believer in the Cajun tradition of lagniappe  --  something extra . Bree lugged the cooler as far as the front door . As soon as she opened it , she almost choked on the raw stench of cigar smoke that lingered in a hazy cloud just outside . Alf Hastings , her father 's director of operations , was sitting in the shade of the verandah next to the fountain . He hurried to his feet as Bree came through the door . " Let me help you with that , " he offered . Alf had n't been on Green Brush Ranch long . Bree did n't know much about him other than he was one of those middle-aged men who gave her the creeps . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard outside her bedroom window on the off chance he might catch her in the act of undressing . " No , thanks , " she said . " I can manage on my own. , , Not one to take no for an answer , Hastings leered at her . " Looks pretty heavy to me , " he said . " At least let me open the gate to the camper . " That was the last thing Brianna O'Brien wanted . If he opened the camper shell on the pickup , he was bound to see all the camping equipment she had smuggled out of the garage and stowed there without anyone-her parents especially-being the wiser . " It goes in front , " she told him , quickly putting the cooler down on the ground . " I 'll have to go back inside to get the key . " He was still standing there puffing on what was left of his cigar when she came back out of the house with the key in hand . " Off to Playas again ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing her ? Had he seen her loading the stuff into the truck and figured out what was really going on ? Or was he just making conversation ? " That 's right , " she said . This time Alf made no offer to help , but she noticed that he had moved off to one side , no doubt hoping to look down her tank top when she bent down to pick up the cooler . Give the dirty old man a thrill . If he 's looking at my boobs , that means he probably is n't looking inside the camper . Once the cooler was properly situated on the rider 's side of the seat , she slammed the door shut . " Hope you keep the doors locked when you head off on your own like this , " Alf said . " A young girl like you ca n't ever be ...
