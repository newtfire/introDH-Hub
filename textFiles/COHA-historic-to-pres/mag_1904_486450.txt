Persons having material  --  especially unpublished MSS. or letters  --  likely to be of service in the preparation of a biography of the late Edward Rowland Sill , are requested to communicate with Mr. W. B. Parker , 30 Stoughton Hall , Cambridge , Mass . Prof Angelo De Gubernatis informs us that he is just beginning the impression of his ' Dictionnaire International des Scrivains du Monde Latin , ' of which we have already spoken , and hopes to finish with it by the end of May . An octavo volume of 1,000 pages , this ' dictionary will contain from five to six thousand biographical notices of writers on Latin ? subjects , of the present day . There is still time for the tardy to send in personal-bibliographical particulars concerning themselves to the editor , whose address is No. 11 via S. Martino al Macao , Rome .

James Flint 's ' Letters from America ' is one of the very best of the reprints in Mr Thwaites 's " Early Western Travels " ( Cleveland ? Arthur H Clark Co ) . This Scotchman was a friendly and level-headed observer , who came over in 1818 , landing in New York when the city outlines were obscured by the masts of vessels , when the Lombardy poplar was the favorite shade tree , and the census showed still some 600 slaves on the island Flint has also to tell of Philadelphia , in passing , and of negro pews even in Quaker meeting-houses ; of Harrisburg , Pittsburgh , Wheeling , etc .

A bulky quarto , the first volume of " The Home Library , " is sent us from the pressof the American Publishing Company of Middlebury , Vt . The book is of the sort that lies on the table in the best room of the farmhouse , and , ? indeed , it is too heavy for the hand It is a collection of extracts from well-known works , familiar poems , etc , and the selection is made with some judgment , although the arrangement is haphazard The numerous photographic illustrations are also capriciously inserted , and few of them have any connection with the text . Many are uninteresting and of inferior execution , but some of the Vermont scenes are of striking beautgr The book is superior to most of its class , and will no doubt be welcome in many homes Even little books have fates of their own , and the tinier the libeller the stranger often the future Some , especially , are indestructible and irrepressible ; sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady of the Lake ' and ' Waverley , ' Marjory Fleming , known as " Pet Marjorie , " wtete 6-9 , was writing her Journal , a life of Mary Queen of Scots , and other works . But it is only some forty years now since tantalizing fragments began to appear , fragments which yet brought the little poet into the great ' Dictionary of National Biography . ' And again , only within the last year have they been fully published from the verbatim copies which the happy care of Dr. John Brown made . The present American edition ( ' Marjorie Fleming : The Story of Pet Marjorie , together with her Journal and her Letters , ' by L MacBean , Putnams ) , adds Dr. John Brown 's sketch . The juxtaposition is unhappy , for the editor has imitated Dr Brown 's method of running comment , and has in no way reached his curious felicity. - But Marjory 's own words will live with the language . They are those of a healthy child , and of a healthily conscious artist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mystery of style and charm She is the one example without affectation or sickliness of the child with a pen - Messrs . A &; C Black 's series of descriptive books illustrated in color is draw-mg out now in long array , and evidently has met the popular mind In them the contributor of the " letterpress , " to use a politely ambiguous term , is in much the position of the librettist of an opera : with the difference that his work is done in docile sequence and more or less annexlon to the pictures Such cases as Mr. Kelly 's ' Egypt , ' where artist and describer happily combine , are of necessity rare . In " Bonnie Scotland , " painted by Sutton Palmer and described by A R. Hope Moncrieff ( Macmillan ) , the describer has exercised a tolerable independence and produced a very entertaining book , full of bits of history , character , and custom , anecdote and reminiscence , all much fresher than might easily have been expected ; ties of blood , also , and intimacy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life have been his fortunate guides . His patriotism is of the pawky , discriminating kind which lends insight . The pictures , too , are good and suggestive , if not too closely viewed . Their limitations are those of the color process , and for magic mists and transparent rays color processes have no spell . The light that never was , on sea or land , perhaps neighbors closest to Scottish hills and seas , purple or gray , but it no mechanical art , can reach . Yet Mr. Palmer has done much , and the printer has done his best ; and the results , for suggestion or memories , will stand for much more than they are in themselves . Those who plan to live in the country are nowadays in danger of being distracted by the multitude of advisers . Mr. E. P. Powell , however , is no mere amateur , and his book , ' The Country Home ' ( McClure , Phillips &; Co. ) , is full of practical suggestions drawn from a long and successful experience in horticulture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , water supply , and drainage , buildings , roads , etc. , and adds a- frequent dose of sentiment , which is wholesome and genuine , even if not always far above the prosaic . The very full lists of meritorious trees , shrubs , fruits , vegetables , and flowers should be found of value by every one who cares for a garden , as Mr. Powell appears to have tested whatever he recommends . The book is pleasantly illustrated , and is in every way creditable to the publishers . To such of our readers as may desire a brief survey of Goethe 's literary activitY ? we can with safety commend H. G. Atkins 's Johann Wolfgang Goethe ' ( London : Methuen ) , in the series of " Little Biographies . " The get-up of it ' is charming ; the paper is light but opaque , and the print is a delight to the eye . The author 's style , also , . is appropriate ; lucid , direct , unaffected , it does not divert the reader 's attention from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; still , it is by no means dull . Of course , one should not expect'even an epitome of the real Goethe in 170 pages ; what one gets here is merely a rapid glance at Goethe the author . Of Goethe 's influence in finance and politics , in art , science , and philosophy , scarcely a word . Yet this side of Goethe is the one which now attracts most attention in his own country . The German , to whom " Werther , " ' Meister , ' and " Faust " are well-worn themes , wishes to know more of Goethe the myriad-minded man . Perhaps some German Goetheaner will succeed before long in digesting the now undigested mass of the " Jahr buch " and countless monographs , and laying bare the springs of action of which Goethe 's poetry was but one manifestation . Meanwhile , the English reader can profit by the present volume . It is accurate in what it gives , readable and healthful in tone , and well proportioned . We regret that the author speaks ( p. 93 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers in Der Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeiger were no more " journalism " than were Addison 's papers in the Spectator . Goethe cared even less than Addison for the day 's doings . To do anything like justice to Mr. William H. Winch 's ' Notes on German Schools ' ( Longmans ) , the reviewer should have at his disposal ' the columns of a Pachzeitschrift . We in this place must be content with noting the author 's painstaking method and his sobriety of tone . The reader can not but feel that the author has tried honestly to apprehend the salient facts of a complicated system and to present them clearly . In general , the schools here discussed are those below the Gymnasium , and correspond in the main to our New York " grades . " In certain studies , however , such as algebra , geometry , and foreign languages , the work overlaps that of our high school . In foreign languages , especially , it is much more thorough and rational . The whole question of language-instruction has evidently a strong interest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ) : " How often , for example , one reads an account of the teaching of foreign languages in Germany which leads us to think that grammatical teaching is dead , that exercise writing is abolished , that no translation is permitted , and that oral instruction by the direct method is the only one in favor with the best teachers . The detailed lessons which I give form a needful corrective to such notions . " And , again , we would call attention to the remarks upon the character of the German teacher , upon the study of grammar , upon the " old " and the " new " method ( pp. 197-202 ) . Altogether , the book is rich in food for thought . If Winch 's book is in the main a collocation of facts and data , with at most a passing judgment . by the author , BagsterCollins 's ' The Teaching of German in Secondary Schools ' ( Macmillan ) is dodtrine from ? start to finish . The book undertakes to show how German may be taught to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , the reviewer should have the space of a Fachgelehrter addressing his Collegen . We , in our more restricted sphere , can only testify that the book is well planned and well written . The author inclines to the " new " method of teaching , without going to the extreme in his inclination ; his doctrine is always mindful of American conditions and limitations . In substance , the book is a response to the Report of the Committee of Twelve , 1898 . We are not disposed to take issue with the author , even where he seems to have entered upon debatable ground ; for his opinions are at least matured , and , after all , the field is open to every form of illuminating discussion . Only upon one point do we venture upon a general dissent . " Learning to speak is a complex process , compared with learning to read " ( p. 20 ) ; " translating and reading a language are two different processes , for a pupil may read a language almost as his mother-tongue , and yet flounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( p. 199 ) . Both these utterances are true , yet they are far from giving the whole truth . In view of the circumstance that Columbia publications now abound in psychology , we would ask what is the psychology underlying this whole business ? Is it definitively psychological to say that speaking one 's own commonplaces is more " complex " than reading the pregnant utterances of another ? Does not the fundamental difficulty in translating lie in the need of adjusting one 's own mentality to the mentality of the original ? If that Is the case , we can scarcely admit ' that the American who reads his Goethe " almost " as English truly understands his Goethe . The chapter on Pronunciation is vigorous and wholly up to date . The Jefferson letters , in the seventh volume of the Buffalo Historical Society 's Publications , are likely to attract general attention . They are fourteen in number , eight of which appear to be now printed for the first time . They were written to Francis Adrian van der Kemp ( 1752-1829 ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barneveld , New York , later Trenton . All of them ' possess the true Jeffersonian flavor . An extract from one dated April 25 , 1816 , is just now gaining Wide currency , for the reason that it has been quoted by Dr. Cyrus Adler in his admirable Introduction to the so-called " Jefferson Bible , " which Congress in handsome style is distributing through the country . Whoever examines the full text will be inclined to think that - what the writer of the Introduction does not print has been judiciously omitted . Gen. Henry A. S. Dearborn 's letters in the same volume are more or less valuable . The Life of Augustus Porter is likewise of general interest . This able pioneer of the Niagara region has left his mark in the history of western New York . The name of Porter is associated with Niagara Falls as closely as is that of Irving with the Hudson . Judge Porter 's own narrative , written in 1848 , possesses much of the charm that attends the plain , simple talk of a man of action who tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The early annals of Buffalo , it is evident , are well cared for . This well-printed volume is a credit to the Society and to the editor . It has several illustrations , mostly portraits ; and the index of names appears to be full . Under the title , " A Doubtful Island of the Pacific , " Mr. James D. Hague gives an account , in the National Geographic Magazine for December , of the various attempts to discover an island or group of islands reported to lie about midway between Hawaii  --  and Panama . The unexplored region in question consists of some 40,000 square miles , of which 10,000 have been carefully searched by the Albatross in 1899 and the Tacoma in May , 1904 , without finding any trace of land . A special interest in the investigation is the possibility that the United States sloop-of-war Levant , which sailed from Hilo for Panama , September 18 , 1860 , may have been wrecked on some unknown island , and that some of her crew may still survive : It was on this ill-fated vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , his romantic career , and Mr. Hague closes with this characteristic note from Dr. E. E. Hale , which he found awaiting him on his landing from the Tacoma : " If you have found dear Phil Nolan , bring . him at once to this house ; I will ' adopt him - as my grandfather . " Among the other contents are an address on China by the Hon. John W. Foster , and an ' abstract of the report of General Greely , Chief Signal Officer . Of the Alaskan telegraph system he . says : " The entire construction of 3,625 miles includes not only 2,079 miles of cable and 1,546 miles of land lines , but also a wireless system of 107 miles " between Cape Nome and Fort St. Michael . This " perfects the military intercommunicating system of the United States . " Every important military command , except the legation guard at Pekin , can now be reached over strictly American lines of telegraph and cable . A conviction of the strategic importance of the republics of Hayti and Santo Domingo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic which will flow through the Panama Canal , has led the London Times to send a correspondent to the island to study its conditions with a view to the question of Its political future . The results of his experiences in Hayti are given in a recent communication ( December 7 ) , which may be summed up in the assertion that " the great bulk of the people . . . subsist on a social and economic basis but slightly higher than that of Africa . " " In theory republican , the government is a system of arbitrary force , unregulated and unmodified by any consideration save that of individual self-interest and toleration . Martial law is the normal condition in the republic , the military are predominant , officers , soldiers , and police are the most conspicuous element everywhere The houses of the ministers are guarded , they themselves go about armed with revolvers , and all night long the towns echo to the challenging of guards . " Hayti 's independence as a negro State is the fundamental principle on which its existence is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer on the subject , and the possibilities for Hayti involved in American intervention in Santo Domingo were pointed out , he replied that his race had fought for independence , and would die to a man before it was given up " Trade and banking business are almost entirely in the hands of Germans , though the bulk of the exports go to Havre , the greater proportion of the imports coming from the United States The normal relations between the natives and foreigners  --  a few hundreds only in number  --  are on the surface friendly , but in times of economic and political crises " the atmosphere is electric with fear and uncertainty , a massacre of the whites often being spoken of and always being possible . " Under the auspices of the Verein der Deutschen Ingenieure , a special commission of German scholars has been appointed to cooperate in the unification of the orthography of foreign Scientific and technic cal words . At a recent convention held in Berlin , the principles upon which this uniform spelling es to he based were practically agreed upon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter The meeting , which was largely attended by specialists in the technological departments , could not quite agree whether the new system should be based on the international scientific orthography ( e g , calemiren ) , or on the popular system ( halziwren ) , or whether both systems might be followed . to a certain degree . A list of the words concerned is to be prepared and sent to the different specialists for further study None are more interested an this matter than the editors and publishers of the great Technological Lexicon now in preparation under the auspices of the above society , with Dr Jansen as manager . The Schiller Gedachtniss-Stiftung , an association that purposes to supplant the trashy literature of the day by publishing cheap editions of the best writers , reports that , during the present year , at has distributed gratis more - than 10,000 copies of good books to poor libraries in Germany , Austria , and Switzerland , and that at is prepared to distribute 15,000 during the coming twelvemonth It appeals for membership fees of three marks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamburg . In an address delivered by the retiring rector of the University of Leipzig , Prof Dr Bucher , some new Da ) cts were given in reference to the proposal to assess a special tax on foreign students attending the universities and the technological institutesof the Fatherland , this movement being one of the outcroppings of the anti-foreign spirit which has been making itself felt of late to a noteworthy degree in the academic world of the Enipire . The project was even discussed in the Reichstag , and there found . some favor . A conference of rectors was held in Leipzig , which decided to throw its influence against the proposed innovation , on the ground that such an extra tax could not be justified , seeing that the presence of foreigners does not increase the expenses of these schools Bucher declares that , to his knowledge , none of the German State Governments show any inclination to put this additional burden on students from abroad . ? Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. complete their centenary edition of Emerson 's works by the simultaneous publication of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miscellanies , ' and ' Natural History of Intellect , - and Other Papers . ' Dr. Emerson 's taste and skill in editing and annotating this edition of his father 's writings have held out bravely to the end Indeed , these qualities have been less conspicuous in the former volumes Perhaps the - truer word would be that the biographical and local sketches , especially those dealing with Concord subjects , are more fertile in suggestion and reminiscence for the editor than those of a more abstract character . Emerson 's " Historical Discourse at Concord " has seemed to many so perfect of its kind that there could be no addition or subtraction without harm , but Dr Emerson 's notes to this address are uncommonly rich So are those to the short papers en Dr Ripley and Mary Moody Emerson There are no additions to the body of the Lectures and Biographical Sketches ' as compared with this volume in the Riverside edition , but to the ' Miscellanies ' of that edition we have here some notable additions . They include a most noble letter written to President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians from Georgia , and a Concord speech on - the Fugitive Slave law , after its enactment The Shakspere speech at the Boston Saturday Club has an amusing history Emerson 's endorsement on the manuscript was to the effect that the speech was delivered at the Revere House April 23 , 1864 . Mr Cabot 's recollection is that Emerson made no speech , but a dead funk , remaining , however , serene and unabashed , though unable to say a word Emerson 's interview with Lincoln , recently published in the Atlantic , is not published with the notes on his Lincoln speech , but reserved for a later publication of certain selections from Emerson 's journals . ? The twelfth volume as much richer than the corresponding volume in the Riverside edition . It contains five new lectures , two of which , " Country Life " and " Concord Walks , " are in Emerson 's most pleasing ' vein , and their inclusion with the other three is auite as much in order as that of many other things for the publication of which Emerson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the volume Which he edited on their original publication The sections added to the " Natural History of Intellect " are interestingand valuable , but , like the narrower inclusion , are convincing that Emerson had little faculty for a systematic presentation of his philosophic thought Much interesting light is thrown on the methods of Emerson 's work . His trans .. ference of matter from one lecture or essay to another was apparently habitual , and the final or secondary setting was seldom an improvement on the first . A general index to the twelve volumes covers 125 pages . It is remarkably full and appears to be exceedingly well done . In its present form it is the work of Miss Laura Woolsey Lord , ? Volumes xvii , and xix of ' The Philippine Islands , 1493-1898 ' ( Cleveland : Arthur H Clark Co ) bring the record forward from 1609 to 1621 It was a period notable , in the matter of striking events , for the continual struggles with the Dutch in the Orient , not only at the very entrance of Manila Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan , then soon to be almost completely shut up to Europe again These volumes naturally bring forth various documents bearing on these conflicts , as well as documents for the years 1619-1621 , touching the proposal to abandon the Philippines because of the costliness of the foothold maintained by Spain in the Orient- at a time when Philip III and his resources were sadly strained at home It is a favorite assertion of historians given to the picturesque that Philip III held to the Philippines , cost what they might , solely because of his desire to christianize their people . That the friars ' arguments availed greatly with him is certain , but it is plain from the record that the hope of empire , and the shame of abandoning it in the face of reversals , were motives that played at least as great a part . These three volumes , however , deal rather with the more significant matters of internal government of the Philippines than with the striking events of buccaneer warfare . ? The documents are mostly drawn from the original manuscripts , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the case throughout the series . The letters from Jesuits are of prime value , and also deal considerably with China , Japan , and India . A. reprint of Hernando de los Rios Coroners memorial on faults of administration and abuses of the natives in the Philippines , first published at Madrid in 1621 , is also notable . The various documents mostly shed . some light on the drain upon Philippine resources , and still more the impoverishment and abuse of the Filipinos resultant upon the equipment of ships to fight the Dutch among the Spice Islands . The editors have performed . good . service by interposing selections from the Laws of the Indies , the other documents revealing by comparison how far these humane provisions came from successful enforcement . Volume xvii has a valuable appendix in the form of a list of the various governors of the archipelago from beginning to end of Spanish rule , the most correct and serviceable yet compiled in English , with abstracts from Sinibaldo de Mas ( 1843 ) and Montero y Vidal ( 1866 ) on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abstract of ' Spanish government in the first volume of the Report of the Philippine Commission ( Schurman ) of 1900 ( the fault of which abstract was that it was mostly confined to the provisions of administrative reforms but recently enacted ) , and the student will have a very good working knowledge of Spanish administration . It is regrettable to hear that this series has received most scanty support in the United States , even from libraries , though this is only another evidence of the lack of any serious effort worth mentioning as yet in the study of Philippine history and affairs in our country . The publishers of the series have been comnelled to announce that , beginning with February next , they will limit the number of volumes printed strictly to the number subscribed . ? Mr William Macbeth , the picture-dealer , publishes a thin volume of less than sixty pages , ' Homer Martin : A Reminiscence , ' by the painter 's widow . The book is well and simply , if not quite frankly , written , and has a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of its publisher , afford " valuable insight into the life and work of this highly gifted artist . " As is inevitable , however , the insight given is rather into the causes of the artist 's weaknesses and , partial failure than into the sources of his strength . No one has ever been able to explain genius or even talent , it is possible to show , in some degree , why genius or talent did not had fuller fruition The causes of Martin 's shortcomings as a painter seem to have been an almost total lack of systematic training , a temperamental inability to work except when in the mood , a defective vision culminating in almost entire blindness , and certain " habits " and " propensities " which are hinted at but not named . Against each of these handicaps artists have victoriously contended  --  against all of them together no one could quite victoriously contend . Mrs. Martin quotes George H. Boughton to the effect that if Martin hadbeen a pupil of Corot 's he " could hardly paint more like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and color there is indeed a marked similarity between the works of the two painters ; but of the breadth of design and of the suave perfection of a personal but , masterly technique which marked the great Frenchman , there is little trace in the work of the American Of what he was we have learned to be justly proud , to understand may be to pardon , but need not be to forget what he was not . ? There are not many philosophers . as distinguished from the professors of philosophy , but the late Thomas Davidson was of the number . He deliberately chose the vocation of a sophist , to use the term as explained by Grote , and refused to attach himself to any scholastic corporation . He took money for his teaching from those who could afford it , but gave counsel freely to the poor . An account of the results of a few lectures which he delivered on the East Side of New York has now been prepared by Mr. Charles M. Bakewell , and published by Ginn . &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Incredible as it may seem , Davidson aroused in a gathering of people nearly all whose waking hours were devoted to manual toll , an enduring interest in books and subjects which are quite beyond the capacity of most of the " leisure class " He set them a stiff course , but they proved themselves equal to it , and have continued the movement with wonderful courage . What is even more remarkable , Davidson at the outset persuaded many of his hearers , who knew no hope but that offered by Socialism , that there was a higher ideal . Socialism , he showed , involved the loss of the very thing for which the State exists  --  personal jib erty . To preserve liberty and at the same time secure opportunity for self-development , implies the existence of the conditions that Would make Socialism possible . In other words , society will be reformed when the people who compose it became elevated , morally and spiritually ; and without this elevation no changes in government or in material wealth will make the world better . Mr Bakewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment and its present results , and his account of Davidson and his philosophy should perpetuate the memory of a man who labored sincerely and successfully to bring light into the lives of his fellows . ? The latest lists of hooks and articles on special subjects issued by the Library of Congress , as prepared under the direction of the chief bibliographer , Mr. Griffin , draw fresh attention to the defective bibliographical workmanship of this series . We have never been able to understand why books , articles in periodicals , and Government documents are listed separately , nor why the books are arranged alphabetically while in all the other divlisions the titles are arranged chronologically , nor why the alphabetical index to authors should cover the similarly arranged list of books The absence of topical indexes is a serious blemish . The distinction between the divisions is not always kept in mind by the compiler . In the list on Immigration , for instance , several articles in periodicals and in Congressional documents are listed as if books , and at least one , John P. Altgeld 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under articles in periodicals  --  it was first printed in the Forum for 1890 ? and as a " book , " because it was afterwards reprinted in the author 's collection of essays called ' Live Questions ' In the list on the Far East a number of book-titles are accompanied by descriptive or commendatory quotations , but the sources are not always indicated Each of the lists mentioned is prefaced by a note describing the material and repeating a number of the titles , with an occasional word or two . of evaluation , too many titles are given to be of any value as guides , and the evaluation as haphazard What is here said of the lists just issued is true of nearly all of the publications of the Division of Bibliography , their standard is not what one has a right to expect from publihations emanating from the National Library . ?

THE RECENT HISTORY OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS . A Histo'y of South , America , 1854-1904 By 1Charles Edmond Akers With illustrations E. P Dutton &; Co 1904 . It is surprising , when one considers the size of the South American States , and the importance which some of them are acquiring , that so little has been written about them , either by way of describing their economic and social condition or as a record of their history Americans , Englishmen , and Germans seem to have found them - either too uninteresting or too troublesome and perplexing an object of study , so that until now it has been hard to discover any trustworthy account of the political phenomena which distinguish these republics from the rest of the world . Mr. Akers had accordingly every justification for attempting a condensed account of the recent history of South America such as his volume presents- He takes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uruguay , Brazil , Chile , Peru , Bolivia , Ecuador , Colombia , Venezuela , treating the four last named very curtly , and the others more at length . Two chapters ' give a rather too sketchy general introduction , four in the middle are devoted to an account of the war between Chile and Peru , while a concluding one reviews the general situation . and intimates views of the future . The plan is good , and the execution not unworthy of the plan Although the author tells us that he is a journalist by profession , who has resided for fourteen years in South America , there is nothing in his style characteristic of either the newspaper correspondent or of the leading-article writer . He is plain , concise , businesslike , using no rhetoric , spreading himself out with no vague amplifications He does not profess to write as a philosopher , examining=-the causes of the political phenomena which he describes , nor does he make any reference . by way of illustration , to the political phenomena of other governments in other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes sensibly and temperately , making on his reader at least the impression of a man who deserves confidence The book is one not meant to charm those who read for entertainment , but addresses itself to persons who desire to be informed regarding the recent history and present state of a vast continent which must play in the future a larger part than it has played in the past Such persons will find in its pages most of the facts they - need ; there .. 1s , liadeedi so far as we know ,
