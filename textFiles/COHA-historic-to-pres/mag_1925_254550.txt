U. S. Ambassador Myron T. Herrick , accompanied by Abd-el-Krim , his dog , left France for the U. S. on board the Paris . <P> At Versailles , the wind blew-blew so hard that it uprooted a fine willow that had been weeping for Napoleon for nearly 100 years . In 1832 , this tree was planted at Versailles from a cutting , obtained under British fire , by a Lieutenant Drouville from Napoleon 's grave at St. Helena . <P> Trade negotiations between France and Germany , reported ruptured ( TIME , July 13 ) , are to be continued on Sept 15 . <P> French coke output for May was greater by 10,000 tons than the monthly average for 1913 . The figures were : May , 255,000 tons ; 1913 monthly average , 245,000 tons . <P> The brow of one M. Raphael Duflos clouded . On the porch of his country house was a trunk . He approached gingerly , opened it . Ah ! then he was just in time , for the trunk was filled with his valuables . After tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let himself into the house . Placed conspicuously on a table was a letter addressed to his wife , Mme. Hugette Duflos , once a Comdie Francaise beauty about whom half Paris raved and about whom the other half would have raved had it not been raving about other beauties . M. Duflos , visibly agitated , tore open the letter , read : <P> I did not go so far as to steal your things , madam , and will confess to you why . When entering here I swear to you I did not know whose house it was . Passing by chance , I thought it looked like a likely place to contain nice things . You will be able to see I am a man of good taste . While continuing my inventory , I happened to come across pictures of the woman whom I admire most in the whole world , both in the theatre and on the screen . Imagine my surprise . I am sincerely sorry to have disarranged the charming interior and make every apology and abandon everything I coveted to take along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimental nonsense . " I will indemnify him . But allow me , madam , to take your pictures . Your radiant beauty , which seems to me also to speak of great goodness of heart , will excuse this petty larceny . Some day I will write and tell you my life duty . Perhaps it will be you , madam , who will prove to be my redeemer . <P> At the Lyce Louis-le-Grand in the heart of the Latin Quarter , where he had gone upon invitation to distribute prizes , ex-Premier Edouard Herriot rose to address the assembled boys . He got no further . Young Royalists of the organization Action Franchise whistled , howled , cat-called . In vain , the police attempted to restore order and in the end the ex-Premier was forced to leave . Outside the Lyce , the same demonstration was carried on . Several arrests were made , but to no avail and it was not until he entered the Chamber of Deputies that he was cheered : " Vive Herriot ! Down with the Action Frangaise assassins !
