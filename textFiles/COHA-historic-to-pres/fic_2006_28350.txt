The Ghost Orchid By Carol Goodman Random House Carol Goodman I came to Bosco for the quiet . That 's what it 's famous for . The silence reigns each day between the hours of nine and five by order of a hundred-year-old decree made by a woman who lies dead beneath the rosebushes -- a silence guarded by four hundred acres of wind sifting through white pines with a sound like a mother saying hush . The silence stretches into the still , warm afternoon until it melts into the darkest part of the garden where spiders spin their tunnel-shaped webs in the box-hedge maze . Just before dusk the wind , released from the pines , blows into the dry pipes of the marble fountain , swirls into the grotto , and creeps up the hill , into the gap- ing mouths of the satyrs , caressing the breasts of the sphinxes , snaking up the central fountain alle , and onto the terrace , where it exhales its resin- and copper-tinged breath onto the glasses and crystal decanters laid out on the balustrade . Even when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , while the ice settles in the silver bowls and we brush the yellow pine needles off the rattan chairs , when it seems the silence will never be broken . When it seems that the silence might continue to accumulate -- like the golden pine needles that pad the paths through the box-hedge maze and the crumbling marble steps and choke the mouths of the satyrs and fill the pipes of the fountain --  and finally be too deep to disturb . Then someone laughs and clinks his glass against another 's , and says . . . " Cheers . Here 's to Aurora Latham and Bosco . " " Here , here , " we all chime into the evening , sending the echoes of our voices rolling down the terraced lawn like brightly colored croquet balls from some long-ago lawn party . " God , I 've never gotten so much work done , " Bethesda Graham says , as if testing the air 's capacity to hold a longer sentence or two . We all look at her with envy . Or maybe it 's only me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done today , but because everything about Bethesda bespeaks confidence , from her slim elegant biographies and barbed critical reviews to her sleek cap of shiny black hair with bangs that just graze her perfectly arched eyebrows -- which are arched now at Nat Loomis , as if the two of them were sharing some secret , unspoken joke -- and set off her milk-white skin and delicate bone structure . Even Bethesda 's size -- she ca n't be more than four nine -- is intimidating , as if everything superfluous had been refined down to its essential core . Or maybe it 's just that at five nine I loom over her and my hair , unmanageable at the best of times , has been steadily swelling in the moist Bosco air and acquired red highlights from the copper pipes . I feel like an angry Valkyrie next to her . " Magic , " says Zalman Bronsky , the poet , sipping his Campari and soda . " A dream . Perfection . " He releases his words as if they were birds he 's been cupping in his hands throughout the day . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist . The famous novelist . I 'd had to stop myself from gasping aloud when I recognized him on my first day at Bosco -- and who would n't recognize that profile , the jawline only slightly weaker than his jacket photos suggest , the trademark square glasses , the hazel eyes that morph from blue to green depending ( he once said in an interview ) on his mood , the tousled hair and sardonic grin . Along with the rest of the world ( or at least the world of MFA writing programs and bookish Manhattan ) , I had read his first novel ten years ago and fallen in love -- with it , with its young , tough , but vulnerable protagonist , and with the author himself . And along with the rest of that little world I 'd been immersed in these last ten years , I could n't help wondering where his second novel was . Surely , though , the fact that he 's here is a favorable sign that it 's only a matter of time before the long-awaited second novel is born out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too quiet , " Nat says , now taking a sip of the single-malt scotch that the director , Diana Tate , sets out each night in a cut-glass decanter . David Fox , a landscape architect who I 've heard is writing a report on the gardens for the Garden Conservancy , holds up a Waterford tumbler of the stuff , the gold liquor catching a last ray of light as the sun impales itself on the tips of the pines at the western edge of the estate , and proposes a toast , " To Aurora Latham 's Sacro Bosco -- a sacred wood indeed . " " Is that what the name means ? " asks one of the painters who 've just joined us on the terrace . " I thought it was a funny name for an artists ' colony -- is n't it some kind of chocolate milk housewives made in the fifties ? " The other artists , who are just now straggling in from their out- lying studios and cabins like laborers returning from the fields , laugh at their cohort 's joke and grouse that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good chairs , leaving them the cold stone balustrade . One ca n't help but notice that there 's a class system here at Bosco . The writers , who stay in the mansion , play the role of landed gentry . Nat Loomis and Bethesda Graham somehow manage to make their identical outfits of black jeans and white T-shirts look like some kind of arcane English hunting wardrobe . Even unassuming Zalman Bronsky , in his rumpled linen trousers and yellowed , uncuffed , and untucked dress shirt , looks like the eccentric uncle in a Chekhov play . " She named it after the Sacro Bosco garden in Bomarzo -- near Rome , " I say , my first spoken words of the day . I 'm surprised my vocal cords still work , but , after all , my book -- my first novel -- is set here at Bosco , which is why I know that the estate is n't named for a bed- time beverage . I address my remarks to David Fox , though , because the other writers , especially Bethesda Graham and Nat Loomis , still scare me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , never call Nat Nathaniel , or Bethesda Beth . I smiled at that evidence of vanity on their parts , but then I remembered that I 'd been quick enough to modify my own name to Ellis when I published my first story . After all , who would take seriously a writer called Ellie ? " She saw it on one of the trips she and Milo Latham took to Italy , " I add , " and was inspired to create her own version of an Italian Renaissance garden here on the banks of the Hudson . " We all look south toward where the Hudson should be , but the towering pines obscure the view . Instead we are looking down on crumbling marble terraces and broken statuary -- statues of the Muses , whose shoulders are mantled with the gold dust of decaying pine needles and whose faces ( at least on the statues who still have their heads ) are cloaked in shadow and green moss . The hedges and shrubbery -- once clipped and ordered -- have overgrown their neat geometry and now sprawl in an untidy thicket across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sphinxes who once spouted water from their mouths and breasts , leads to a statue of a horse poised on the edge of the hill as if it were about to leap into the dark , overgrown boxwood maze -- Aurora Latham 's giardino segreto -- at the bottom of the hill . Somewhere at the center of the maze is a fountain , but the hedges have grown too high to see it now . " Actually , the garden 's closer in design to the Villa d'Este at Tivoli , " Bethesda Graham murmurs , sipping her mineral water . " The idea of all these fountains and the springs running down the hill into a grotto and then out to the main fountain and from there to the river and finally to the sea . . . Aurora wrote in her Italian journal that she wanted to create a garden that was the wellspring of a fountain like the sacred spring on Mount Parnassus . " Bethesda pronounces Aurora 's name as if she were a contemporary who 'd only moments ago quit the terrace . Of course , I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethesda 's the expert here . " The whole hill is a fountain , " David Fox says . " One might even say the entire estate . Pumps draw the water up from the spring at the bottom of the hill and then pipes funnel the water down the hill though a hundred channels . On a night like this we would have heard the water cascading down the terraces like a thousand voices . " Zalman Bronsky murmurs something . I lean forward to ask him to repeat himself , but then the words , half heard and still lingering in Bosco 's perfect silence , sound clearly in my head . " ' The eloquence of water fills this hill , ' " I repeat . " How lovely . It 's iambic pentameter , is n't it ? " The poet looks startled , but then he smiles and takes out of his jacket a piece of paper that has been folded in quarters and begins to write down the line . When he sees it 's too dark to , he gets up to go inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their manual labors having given them keener appetites . " What happened to the fountains ? " I ask David Fox , but it 's Bethesda who answers . " The spring dried up , " she says , taking another careful sip from her glass . " Not a particularly good omen for those who 've come to drink at the wellspring of the Muses , " Nat says , downing the last of his scotch . " We might as well go inside for dinner . " He looks into his empty glass as if its dryness stood for the dried-up pipes of the fountain . Bethesda takes the glass from him as he gets up and follows him through the French doors into the dining room . David Fox and I are left alone on the terrace looking down on the overgrown garden . " So when you finish researching the garden , will it be restored ? " I ask . " If we get funding from the Garden Conservancy , " he says , draining the last drop of scotch from his glass . I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wineglass . As his hand brushes mine , I feel a tremor -- as if the pipes of the old fountain below us had come to life and were about to send forth jets of water , into the last lingering glow of the sunset . The garden wavers and quakes like a reflection in a pool of water , and I see a slim white figure swimming at its center . I force my eyes shut and , ignoring the sweet , spicy smell that has swept over the terrace , count to ten . When I open them , the garden has gone still and I can see that the slim white figure is only a statue standing below the western edge of the terrace and the scent of vanilla has faded from the air . " You 're right , " I say , " it is prettier as a ruin . " He laughs . " I agree , but I never said anything of the kind . The Garden Conservancy would have me fired if I did . " At dinner I sit between Zalman Bronsky and Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Fox , because I 'm still embarrassed at what happened on the terrace . Of course he had n't said that the garden was prettier in ruins . It was only my imagination . Sometimes after a day of writing , after listening to the voices of my characters in my head , I begin to imagine that I can actually hear their voices .
