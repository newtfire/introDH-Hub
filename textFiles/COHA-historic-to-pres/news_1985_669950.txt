TOKYO  --  At a Tokyo department store , a Japanese housewife in her fifties is looking through a rack of French dresses . Yes , she says , she watched Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone ' s television appeal to the Japanese people to buy more foreign goods . So will she ? She frowns . " I bought American electrical appliances 10 years ago , but they seem to be getting worse and worse each year , " she says . " I won ' t buy more foreign goods just because Prime Minister Nakasone asks me to . I will buy foreign goods only if they are better than Japanese products . " She turns and heads for another department . " Today , I haven ' t bought any foreign goods , " she adds . Nobody said you could change Japan overnight . Occasionally , of course , it has happened . In a radio speech at the end of World War II , Japan ' s emperor told the nation to end its hatred of Americans and begin cooperating with them immediately , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal for imports , no matter how unusual it may be , isn ' t likely to have the same effect . Indeed , an entirely unscientific survey of Japanese businesses and consumers suggests that many people here hadn ' t heard about the speech Tuesday night , in which the prime minister dropped his austere facade and appealed to people directly , in colloquial language . He told the Japanese they were facing an international crisis similar to the days before World War II . Many of those who heard about the speech say they don ' t share his sense of urgency . That doesn ' t mean nothing will change . Mr. Nakasone ' s speech is the first round in a government campaign to promote imports , and everyone here can expect to feel the pressure . But one reason that Japan showed a $37 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last year is that the Japanese are tough customers . They demand quality goods , and they put that before an international trade crisis . Many of Japan ' s major exporters have been pressured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment from abroad . In response to Mr. Nakasone ' s appeal , they say , in effect , " I gave at the office . " " It was an unprecedented speech by a prime minister and it was a very strong appeal to the public , " says a spokesman for Honda Motor Co . " However , we have already been trying to import foreign goods , so even if we are asked to do more it is difficult . " A Toyota Motor Corp. spokesman says his company is planning to continue its existing procurement program . He notes that last year Toyota imported nearly $190 million of foreign parts , machinery and raw materials , up nearly 40% from a year earlier . He won ' t say how much came from the U.S. , however , and Japanese officials say that companies like Toyota will be feeling direct pressure from government regulatory officials to import more . One retail businessman complains that the speech sounded as if it were aimed more at impressing foreigners than at persuading Japanese to change their habits . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce bureaucratic obstacles if it wanted more imports . In general , the idea of importing more seems to have been greeted , initially at least , with the visceral reaction that foreign goods just aren ' t Japanese enough . A spokesman for Ito-Yokado Co. , a major supermarket chain operator , says that " there still aren ' t many foreign goods fit for the Japanese living and dining style . " Foreign cans , for example , tend to be too big for the Japanese , many of whom prefer small portions and don ' t have large refrigerators , he says . At Mitsukoshi Ltd. , one of Japan ' s oldest department stores , a spokesman is more positive . " The prime minister couldn ' t make such an appeal on television unless there were a considerable sense of crisis , " he says . " As Japanese , we must reflect on the causes of the problem . " He says it is too soon to say whether his store will import more foreign goods . " We have to see the reaction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we haven ' t seen any sign of a change in customers ' attitudes . " Credit : Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal
