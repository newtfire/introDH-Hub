 Lakes region and westward to the Pacific Coast . It is possible , however , that other borderline iodine-deficient areas exist in the U.S. B. Effect of Deficiency Goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland which is located along each side of the trachea in the upper neck area . The enlargement occurs when a lack of iodine causes the thyroid to overwork in an effort to produce more thyroxine or in response to an increased demand by the body for additional thyroxine . When an iodine deficiency occurs and less thyroxine is produced , the anterior pituitary gland releases a thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) which causes the thyroid to overwork in an attempt to produce more thyroxine . But , an enlargement of the thyroid gland may be caused by factors other than an iodine deficiency . Feeding excess iodine to the dam , for example , caused an enlarged thyroid in the foal at Cornell University ( 61 ) . However , this situation seldom occurs . Goitrogens in feeds are capable of producing an enlarged thyroid by interfering with thyroxine synthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cause goiter , especially if the iodine level in the diet is borderline in meeting body needs . To illustrate the importance of ' the thyroid , the gland has been renewed experiXXI. // mentally shortly after birth in all animal species and its removal causes decreased mental , physical , and sexual development . The iodine-deficient foal may be stillborn or show extreme weakness at birth which results in difficulty in standing and suckling . Foals will also show labored breathing and rapid pulse rate . Occasionally , a stillborn foal may be hairless . Foals born alive with a well-developed goiter will usually die or the few that live will remain weaklings . No treatment has been found especially effective . Iodine will prevent goiter but may not have much , if any , effect once the goiter is developed . There is some indication that the incidence of " navel ill " in foals may be decreased by feeding iodine to the brood mares , but , this needs more verification . European studies show a decline in libido ( sex drive ) and semen quality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Iodine deficiency in mares may cause abnormal estrus cycles ( 5 , 52 , 58 ) . Most mares will not show a goiter even though their foals do . This is also the situation with many other animal species . C. Iodine Requirement The recommended iodine requirement for the horse is 0.1 ppm in the total diet ( 5 ) . This is usually supplied by iodized salt or mineral mixtures containing iodine . If the horse diet contains goitrogenic substances , many horse owners will increase the level of iodine in the diet to 0.2 ppm or slightly higher , depending on the level of goitrogenic activity . But , one must not go too high , since excessive levels of iodine may be detrimental . A level of 3.5 ? 4.8 ppm of iodine in the diet has been shown to be harmful to a small percentage of foals ( 52 , 59 ? 61 ) . Affected foals have enlarged thyroids , may be weak , and have skeletal deformities . But , even this level is 35 ? 48 times the iodine requirement . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tolerable in the diet is 5 ppm ( 5 ) . So , there is a good safety factor between the required level of iodine and that which might cause harmful effects . Most other animals do not show harmful effects from excess iodine until a level of 200 ? 600 ppm of iodine is fed in the total diet . Table 6.11 gives the iodine requirement of the horse as recommended by the 1989 NRC Committee ( 5 ) . Table 15.10 gives the suggested iodine level to use in a trace mineralized salt for horses . I ) . Sources of Iodine Iodine is supplied in a number of ways . Potassium iodide is used but requires the addition of stabilizers such as sodium thiosulfate and calcium hydroxide to keep it from being destroyed . Many prefer iodate compounds such as potassium // and calcium iodate because they have a higher level of iodine stability and a stabilizer is not needed . Pentacalcium orthoperiodate ( PCOP ) , sodium iodide , EDDI , and others are also used as sources of iodine . XXII . IRON A. Introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the air in the lungs to all parts of the body and brings back carbon dioxide on the return trip . Hemoglobin contains about 0.33% iron . All red blood cells contain hemoglobin , and a lack of iron causes a lack of red blood cells which causes anemia . About 60% of the total iron in the body is in the blood hemoglobin . The remainder is in other compounds as well as in some important enzyme systems . Thus , iron is very important and affects every organ and tissue in the body . Bone marrow provides an important reserve for iron and is one of the last body reserves to be depleted . So , bone marrow serves as an important diagnostic measure of body iron status . The red blood cells which contain hemoglobin are formed in the bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis . The red blood cells and their hemoglobin are continually being destroyed and replaced . So , iron is constantly needed throughout life and especially during rapid growth when the body is increasing in size and a corresponding increase in total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body properly . When red blood cells are normally destroyed , their iron can be reused to form new ones . But , in certain diseases the iron can not be reused and additional iron is needed . If the red blood cells are not renewed as rapidly as they are destroyed , anemia results . A measure of the adequacy of iron in the diet can be determined by measuring the level of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood . But other factors can also affect this level . B. Effect of Deficiency The primary signs of an iron deficiency are microcytic and hypochromic anemia ( 5 ) . In severe cases of anemia the breathing of the horse becomes heavy and labored . The horse breathes harder in an attempt to make the available hemoglobin carry as much oxygen as possible to the various tissues of the body . An anemic horse , therefore , has difficulty performing any routine task such as walking , working , riding , or performance . It will tire quickly and is unable to do much . The horse becomes weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its blood will look watery if the horse dies and a necropsy is performed . An anemic horse is more susceptible to stress factors and diseases . This causes losses froni secondary effects such as reduced growth rate , diarrhea , and pneumonia . // An iron-deficiency anemia may occur when horses are heavily parasitized . The parasites cause bleeding and loss of blood which in turn causes loss of iron . Increased iron requirements should be carefully watched for in areas where parasitism is heavy . This is especially the case where the climate is hot and humid . Parasite infestation is greater on pastures which are too heavily grazed and the horses are forced to consume forages too close to the ground . The parasite problem is still a very serious one since most horses are usually treated for parasites once a month in areas such as Florida and every 2 months in drier areas such as California . Mare 's milk is low in iron ( 62 ) . Unfortunately , the iron level of the milk can not be increased by feeding iron to the lactating mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or borderline iron intake in the foal if it depends too heavily on mare 's milk for its total feed intake . Fortunately foals will quickly consume other feed and increase their iron intake via that means . Many horse producers supply the foals with a creep feed which usually provides a good source of iron . C. Requirement The 1989 NRC recommended 40 ppm of iron in the diet for mature horses and 50 ppm for growing foals and pregnant and lactating mares ( 5 ) ( Table 6.11 ) . Table 15.10 gives the suggested iron level to use in a trace mineralized salt for horses . An excessive level of iron should be avoided to prevent harmful effects since excess iron is especially toxic to young foals ( 63 ) . A Florida study ( 64 ) showed that adding 1 g of iron ( as ferric citrate ) per kg of diet did not appear to affect growth or bone development of young ponies , nor did it affect various blood constituents . D. General Information Iron is only one of many nutrients needed for hemoglobin formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also needed . High phytate and phosphorus levels have been shown to bind iron and make it unavailable . The kind of fiber and other carbohydrates in the feeds used can also affect iron utilization . Very high levels of iron can also decrease zinc utilization as well as phosphorus absorption although this would be a rare occurrence . Therefore , many nutrient interrelationships are involved in proper iron utilization . Moreover , the form of iron used is important . For example , iron oxide is virtually unavailable to the horse . Iron sulfate has good iron availability and is used extensively . Some samples of iron carbonate have low iron availability and those who use it run tests on it beforehand to make sure the iron has high availability . Sniitli et of . ( 65 ) showed that serum iron concentration alone can not be used to evaluate the iron status of the horse . Dietary iron absorption in nonruminants // fed adequate iron is likely to be 15% or less ( 5 ) . Iron utilization increases in irondeficient diets and diminishes with higher than normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cadmium ( 66 ) . XXIII . COPPER A. Introduction A trace of copper is necessary to serve as a catalyst before the body can utilize iron for hemoglobin formation . Copper is also needed in many animals for growth , reproduction , bone development , tissue respiration , and skin pigmentation . Whether the same is true for the horse is not yet known , but it may be similar . Copper is a constituent of several enzyme systems in the body and therefore , very important for the horse . Dr. W. J. Miller of the University of Georgia reported that determining copper requirements is a very complex matter since molybdenum , zinc , sulfate , calcium , iron , cobalt , manganese , selenium , and other minerals and nutrients can affect copper metabolism and needs . B. Effect of Deficiency A Texas A &; M study by Dr. Charles H. Bridges and co-workers ( 67 ) indicated that osteochondritis dissecans in Thoroughbred foals is clinically similar to the lameness that has been associated with a simple copper deficiency . Their data implicated copper as a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also stated that excess zinc may have played a secondary role by reducing the absorption of copper in the foals . A New Zealand study ( 68 ) also indicated that a lack of copper may be associated with osteochondrosis and osteodysgenesis . Studies ( 69 , 70 ) with horses reared in pastures near a zinc smelter showed that they developed lameness and swollen joints . Both studies reported osteochondrosis and osteoporosis in the foals . Some have suggested that the lesions may have been the result of high zinc levels lowering the copper levels in the foals . These studies implied that excessive levels of zinc may increase copper requirement , as it does in the pig . Another Texas A &; M study ( 71 ) showed that copper-deficient foals developed intermittent , but nondebilitating diarrhea . All the foals developed stilted gaits and ultimately walked on the front of their hooves . An Ohio survey ( 7 ) of horse farms in Ohio and Kentucky revealed a high incidence of osteochondrosis , epiphysitis , and other skeletal disorders in growing horses . They observed indications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skeletal disorders may he related to deficiencies of copper . // zinc , and possibly other minerals . But , in many of their survey sites there were adequate amounts of copper and zinc in the feeds and forages but there was still a high incidence of skeletal disorders in the foals . The Ohio study , and others , indicates that skeletal disorders have a number of causes and are a complex matter . But , it also indicates that one should pay attention to the copper and zinc levels of the diet since they could be involved in certain situations . In another study by Knight et al . ( 72 ) mares were fed 13 and 32 ppm of copper in the diet and their foals were fed a creep feed containing 15 and 55 ppm of copper . All foals were healthy , grew normally , and showed no signs of lameness or ataxia . Histological lesions were reported for each group , however . A Texas A &; M study ( 73 ) showed that a diet containing up to 580 ppm of zinc had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell ( 74 ) showed that a level of 1200 ppm of zinc in the diet of weanling pony colts did not show signs of zinc toxicity or copper deficiency nor signs of osteochondrosis . It is apparent , therefore , that the horse can tolerate a fairly high level of zinc . It also appears that copper and zinc are interrelated with many other minerals and nutrients . These interrelationships may account for different results obtained under different conditions . It is apparent too that osteochondrosis and other bone disorders are complex and that nutrition , genetic predisposition , disease , management , and other factors may be involved . So , a research finding under one set of conditions may not apply under other conditions . It appears that the horse is tolerant to a high level of copper . A Minnesota study ( 75 ) showed that feeding copper at a level of 791 ppm for 6 months resulted in copper accumulation in the liver of mares and foals but there was no evidence that the horses were adversely affected . The 1989 NRC report estimated that 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level ( 5 ) . C. Requirement The 1989 NRC recommends 10 ppm of copper in the diet as the requirement for the horse ( 5 ) . French and German scientists also recommend 10 ppm of copper in the diet for all ages of horse , regardless of degree of work or stage of reproduction ( 5 ) . A Cornell study ( 76 ) estimated the copper requirement for maintenance of mature ponies to be 3.5 ppm in the diet . A University of Florida study ( 77 ) involved feeding three levels of copper , zinc , iron , and manganese to yearling horses . The horses receiving the highest level of the four trace minerals showed the greatest increase in bone mineral from the start to completion of the I 40-day trial . This indicated that the level of one or more of the four trace minerals required may be higher than the 1978 NRC recommendations ( 52 ) . Another Florida study ( 78 ) showed that copper supplementation enhances the level of ' hone mineralization in growing horses . A Colorado State University study ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 to 53 ppm and the copper level from 4 to 12 ppm in the diet did not change the milk content of zinc and copper . There was a trend , however , for the foals of mares fed the higher level of zinc and copper to have a greater gain in weight . A number of studies indicate that forage levels of zinc may be less than 30 ppm in many areas , which is lower than the 1989 NRC requirement of 40 ppm of zinc in the diet of the horse ( 5 ) . Dr. H. F. Hintz of Cornell University ( 80 ) reported that in New York the analysis of more than 5000 samples of forages by the New York dairy forage testing laboratory showed an average of less than 7 ppm of copper . Sometimes the values were lower than 5 ppm . Other studies indicate that the copper level in forages in the U.S. is frequently lower than the 10 ppm that the 1989 NRC recommended ( 5 ) . Dr. Hintz suggested that the grain mixture for horses should contain 20 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this level might not be adequate if only limited amounts of grain are fed or if the forage or environment contains high levels of factors that decrease copper absorption or increase the copper requirement . When horses are fed primarily on forages with little or no concentrate feeding , then the copper , zinc , and other minerals need to be supplied by either trace mineralized salt or a complete horse mineral supplement . Table 6.11 gives the 1989 NRC recommendations on copper requirements of the horse ( 5 ) . Table 15.10 gives the suggested level of copper to use in a trace mineralized salt . D. General Information Horses are tolerant of fairly high levels of molybdenum ; they have not shown any signs of harmful effects on high-molybdenum pastures which severely affect cattle . One study ( 81 ) , however , showed that a level of 5 ? 25 ppm of molybdenum in forages caused disturbances in copper utilization in horses . Extra copper counteracts the high level of molybdenum in cattle . Sulfur also helps counteract high levels of molybdenum but it has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82 ) with ponies showed that the addition of molybdenum to the diet decreased copper absorption and retention as a consequence of increased excretion of dietary copper in the feces and increased excretion of absorbed copper in the bile . Studies in Ireland ( 83 ) showed that fetal livers contained 371 ppm of copper , foal livers 219 ppm of copper , and adult horse livers 31 ppm of copper ( all on a dry matter basis ) . The study indicated that the copper level in the liver decreases with age . A Kentucky study ( 84 ) indicated an apparent relationship between low blood serum copper levels and hemorrhaging in aged parturient mares , suggesting either reduced absorption of copper as horses get older or reduced ability to mobilize copper stores . // A study at Michigan State University ( 85 ) indicates that copper has a sparing effect on the toxicity of selenium in the horse . Colostrum is substantially higher in copper than milk and there appears to be a decline in the copper level of milk throughout lactation . XXIV . ZINC A. Introduction Zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbohydrate , and lipid metabolism . It is also involved with many hormones and their production and activity in the body . Zinc is necessary for a properly functioning immune system which is needed to decrease the body 's susceptibility to infections . Various kinds of stress and disease cause a lower than normal zinc level in the blood plasma . A lack of zinc causes serious consequences in all livestock including the horse . B. Effects of Deficiency The symptoms of a zinc deficiency in the horse are very similar to those in the pig , cattle , sheep , and goat . Foals fed a zinc-deficient diet stopped growing between the 6th and 7th week ( 86 ) . At this time lesions began to appear in the hoof area . These lesions were initially characterized by hair loss and flaking of the dried outer layer of the skin . The lesions extended progressively upward in the legs and by the 90th day were seen on the abdomen ( belly ) and thorax ( chest ) . In some cases , hair along with portions of the dried outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In advanced states of the deficiency , areas of the skin devoid of hair on the legs became covered with a rough , crusty layer of serous exudate and desquamated epithelium ( this would resemble what one might call a mangelike skin condition ) . Small , ordinarily insignificant abrasions on the legs healed poorly . Infections of the lower legs occurred occasionally and required treatment with antibiotics ( applied on the surface of the leg as well as by injection ) . Face lesions around the muzzle and nose developed in the horses between the 70th and 80th day of the deficiency . The foals also showed a hair loss , reduced tissue and blood zinc levels , and reduced blood alkaline phosphatase activity . The foals were slaughtered at the end of 90 days and various tissues in the body were studied . Therefore , no information was obtained on the effect of zinc treatment of the deficient animals . This has been done in the pig , however . Zinc-deficient pigs with their body completely covered with lesions caused by the deficiency ( which resemble a mangy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to normal within 35 days after zinc was added to // the diet . In 1 or 2 days after zinc supplementation , one could see changes occurring . Chances are good that the same might happen with the horse , provided that the zinc deficiency is not long standing . Zinc is needed for the development and maintenance of hair and skin . Since horse owners like to have horses with beautiful looking skin and hair , it is essential that zinc levels in the diet be adequate . C. Requirement The 1989 NRC publication on nutrient requirements of the horse recommends a level of 40 ppm of zinc in the diet ( 5 ) . Research in Kentucky ( 86 ) and Cornell ( 3 ) indicated that a level of 40 and 41 ppm of zinc in the diet , respectively , was adequate under their study conditions . The addition of 5 ppm of zinc to a diet containing 35 ppm of zinc prevented a decrease in blood serum zinc in pregnant mares and a decrease in milk zinc during late lactation ( 58 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diet is near the requirement . A later study with ponies ( 87 ) suggested that their maintenance requirement was less than 3 ? 5 ppm of zinc in the diet when it contained about 3 Meal of digestible energy per kg of dry matter . Table 6.11 gives the 1989 NRC recommendations on the zinc requirements for the horse . Table 15.10 gives a suggested level of zinc to use in a trace mineralized salt for horses . Phytin in feeds produced from plants also affects zinc needs . About 70% of the phosphorus in plants is present as phytin phosphorus . About 50% or more of the phosphorus in cereal grains , and their by-products , is in the form of phytin phosphorus . Soybean meal , cottonseed meal , and other plant protein supplements are also high in phytin phosphorus . Unfortunately , zinc combines with phytin and forms zinc phytate which is insoluble in the digestive tract and remains unabsorbed . This was well demonstrated in swine studies which showed that the pig needed 50 ppm of zinc when fed soybean meal protein as compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contains no phytin phosphorus . Thus , the phytin in grains and their by-products and in soybean meal , cottonseed meal , and other plant protein supplements will increase zinc needs . How much the phytin phosphorus increases the need for zinc in the horse is not known , but it should be taken into consideration as one evaluates zinc requirements for the horse . Recent studies in Florida , Idaho , and some foreign countries show that zinc deficiencies occur in beef cattle grazing forages containing 20 ? 30 ppm of zinc . Other studies indicate that borderline zinc deficiencies may be more common than previously realized . This raises the question about zinc deficiencies occurring in horses fed primarily on pastures or hay from forages containing less than 40 ppm of zinc which is the 1989 NRC zinc requirement for horses ( 5 ) . // The grains are low in zinc levels which vary from 10 to 30 ppm depending on whose analytical figures one uses . Even most plant protein supplements vary from 30 to 70 ppm of zinc . Thus , a combination of grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the concentrate mixture ) will require zinc supplementation . Most commonly used hays , including alfalfa hay as well as dehydrated alfalfa meal , contain less than 30 ppm of zinc . A few hays contain above 30 ppm of zinc . It appears , therefore , that diets commonly fed to horses need zinc supplementation in order to meet NRC zinc requirements . D. Zinc Toxicity The danger of excess zinc is low since the use of 700 ppm of zinc in the diet was not detrimental to mares or their foals ( 88 ) ; excessive levels should , however , be avoided . The 1989 NRC has set 500 ppm of zinc in the diet as the maximum tolerable level . Foals fed 90 g of zinc per day ( equivalent to 2% of the diet or a level of 20,000 ppm ) developed enlarged epiphyses followed by stiffness , lameness , and increased tissue levels ( 89 ) . An Australian study ( 90 ) showed that zinc levels above 1100 ppm induced a copper deficiency under field conditions . Foals grazing near a zinc smelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture being grazed contained 500 ppm of zinc . In another study ( 70 ) the foals from pregnant mares grazed near a zinc smelter had generalized osteochondrosis in many joints of the skeleton . E. General Information The highest concentration of zinc occurs in the choroid and iris of the eye and in the prostate gland ( 5 ) . Intermediate concentrations occur in the epidermal tissues , such as skin and hair . Table 6.12 shows data on the zinc concentration in certain body tissues ( 86 ) . Traces of zinc also occur in the blood , muscles , bones , and in various organs . The colostrum of the mare is rich in zinc and contains 2 ? 3 times the level found in milk ( 62 ) . Studies with the pig showed that zinc requirements appear to be higher for the male than for the female . A zinc deficiency was easier to produce on a diet fed in a dry form as compared to a wet mash . The autoclaving , or heating , of a diet increased the availability of zinc in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pig . If high enough , calcium may double or even triple the zinc requirement . A high copper level depletes zinc stores in the liver and increases zinc needs in the pig . Pigs deficient in iron are more susceptible in zinc toxicity . Studies with other animals indicate that genetics may be involved in zinc requirements since some animals are more seriously affected than others by a deficiency of zinc . " There is also considerable variation in the availability of zinc in various feeds depending on stage of maturity , processing methods used , and many other // factors . It is apparent , therefore , that many factors affect zinc requirements . All of this must be considered as one decides on the level of zinc supplementation to use . XXV . MANGANESE A. Introduction Manganese has some very important functions in the body . It is involved in a number of enzyme systems concerned with protein , fat , and carbohydrate utilization . Manganese is concerned with proper bone development and formation . It is also involved with growth , reproduction , and lactation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animal production . B. Effect of Deficiency The effects of a deficiency of manganese in the horse are not known . With animals other than the horse , bone abnormalities such as lameness , enlarged hock , crooked and shortened legs , overknuckling , ataxia , skeletal deformities , slipped tendon , and others have been obtained with a lack of manganese . The bone becomes lower in mineral content , density , and breaking strength and so breaks occur more easily . In pigs , it sometimes takes two generations on a manganese-deficient diet for the leg abnormalities to show up . The bone abnormalities are more apt to occur if the diet is too high in calcium and phosphorus which reduces the amount of manganese that is absorbed . This may be due to the absorption of the manganese by the precipitated calcium phosphate in the intestinal tract before it is eliminated in the feces . The exact role of manganese in bone formation is still not known . There is evidence , however , that it is concerned with enzyme activity . It has been shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a major constituent of bone cartilage . Manganese is also needed for the formation of mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins . A lack of these two products leads to decreased cartilage formation which might be involved in the skeletal abnormalities obtained with many animals . The organic matrix of the bone is composed largely of mucopolysaccharides . Therefore , while all the complex chemistry may not yet be understood , it is definite that proper bone formation requires an adequate level of manganese . Research studies with other animals have shown that manganese is also concerned with reproduction . In the female , there appear to be three levels or stages of a manganese deficiency . In the least severe deficiency stage , the animal gives birth to live young , some or all of which show incoordination or loss of equi132 6 . Mineral Requirements librium . In the second , or more severe deficiency stage , the young are resorbed , born dead , or die shortly after birth . In the third , or most severe deficiency situation , the estrus cycle is absent or irregular , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an absence of sexual desire occurs . It is associated with a degeneration of testicle germinal epithelium and a lack of sperm production . Whether these deficiency symptoms occur with the horse is not known . They are given , however , so that horse owners are aware of what might occur with a deficiency of manganese . C. Requirement The manganese requirement for the horse is not known but the 1989 NRC ( 5 ) stated that , on the basis of data obtained with other species , 40 ppm in the diet should be adequate . Table 6.11 gives the 1989 NRC requirement for manganese in the horse . Table 15.10 gives a suggested level to use in a trace mineralized salt for horses . D. General Information Some scientists feel that the absorption of manganese from the diet is poor in all animals . A University of Pennsylvania report ( 91 ) showed that in southern New Jersey the manganese level in the soil , grass , and hay is very low . Congenitally enlarged joints , twisted lets , and shortened forelimb bones have been associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It is thought that the extensive liming required to offset the acidic effects of smelter effluent on the soil markedly reduces the availability of manganese . XXVI . COBALT A. Introduction Vitamin B12 contains about 4% cobalt in its molecule . The only known role played by cobalt is in the synthesis of vitamin B12 , which takes place in the digestive tract and which is aided by intestinal microorganisms ( 93 ) . This means that a deficiency of cobalt is a deficiency of vitamin B12 . Horses have remained in good health on pastures so low in cobalt that ruminants confined to them died ( 5 , 52 , 94 ) . The horse 's requirement for cobalt , therefore , is very low . B. Effect of Deficiency No information is available for the horse on the symptoms caused by , a deficiency of cobalt . In cattle and sheep . which are t'riiin ' ; Ulimalx , a lack of // cobalt results in a loss of appetite and weight , weakness , anemia , emaciation , listlessness , and finally death . The anemia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosis of a cobalt deficiency is to give the animal cobalt and determine if it responds . Response is usually rapid with appetite returning within a week . Remission of the anemia , however , will take a longer period of time . All of the cobalt-deficiency symptoms can also be cured with vitamin B12 which is evidence that a cobalt deficiency is actually a vitamin B12 deficiency . Giving the cobalt-deficient animals either cobalt or vitamin B12 may not cure all the symptoms if the deficiency is a long-standing one and irreparable body tissue damage has occurred . The appearance of a cobalt-deficient animal is similar to that of a starved one . The starvation that occurs from a cobalt deficiency results , at least partially , from the inability of the ruminant to metabolize proprionate , since they lack vitamin B12 , which is needed for its utilization by the body . Proprionate is a volatile fatty acid , which is a product of rumen fermentation in ruminants and cecum fermentation in the horse . It is an important source of energy for both the ruminant and the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their utilization since acetate as well as proprionate ( both volatile fatty acids ) need vitamin B12 for their utilization in sheep . It is known that the horse produces volatile fatty acids , especially from forages , in the cecum and that these volatile fatty acids may supply about one-fourth of the energy used by the horse . Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the horse needs vitamin B12 for the utilization of proprionate and possibly other volatile fatty acids . Since grains , forages , and other plant feeds do not contain vitamin B12 , the horse needs to get it from : ( 1 ) microorganism synthesis from cobalt in the digestive tract ; ( 2 ) some animal protein supplement ; ( 3 ) diet supplementation ; or ( 4 ) some combination of these three sources . There is no doubt that the horse needs the vitamin for many body functions . The big questions are whether supplementation is needed and what role does cobalt play in meeting the vitamin B12 needs of the horse . C. Requirement There is experimental evidence to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cobalt in the diet and that some absorption of the synthesized vitamin B12 occurs . It would appear , therefore , that the horse has a requirement for cobalt even though that level may be quite low . Many people use 0 . I ppm cobalt in the diet or a trace mineralized salt which contains cobalt as a means of ' ensuring an adequate intake of cobalt for vitamin B12 synthesis by the horse . The still unanswered question is how much of the vitamin B12 needs of the horse is supplied by synthesis in the digestive tract . This is still not known , so many owners with high-level performance horses supplement their diets with vitamin l 12 to ensure that this vitamin is not deficient in their animals . // The 1989 NRC publication on nutrient requirements for the horse states that an intake of 0.1 ppm of cobalt in the diet should be adequate for the horse ( 5 ) . It is doubtful if the horse needs cobalt if the diet contains an adequate level of vitamin B12 . To be on the safe side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate in cobalt as well . Table 6.11 gives the 1989 NRC recommendations on cobalt needs of the horse ( 5 ) . Table 15.10 gives a suggested level of cobalt to use in a trace mineralized salt . A condition called polycythemia , caused by excess cobalt , occurs in some animals . Presumably it might also occur in the horse . Polycythemia results in an abnormally high level of red blood cells . This condition should be avoided since it is harmful . A very wide margin exists between the level of cobalt needed to meet nutritional requirements and that which is toxic . Ruminants require from 0.05 to 0.1 ppm of cobalt in the total diet . Harmful effects from excess cobalt may occur at levels of 10 ? 200 ppm . The 1989 NRC ( 5 ) has recommended 10 ppm of cobalt in the diet as the maximum tolerable level to use for horses . This is about 100 times the requirement . D. General Information Cobalt is normally not stored in significant quantities in the body . What is stored does not easily pass back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse where it can be used for vitamin B12 synthesis . As far as is known , there is no synthesis of vitamin B12 from cobalt in the body tissues . It is only synthesized in the digestive tract by microorganisms located there . Therefore , ruminants need a continuous supply of cobalt in the daily diet in order to ensure a continuous supply of vitamin B12 from microorganism synthesis . The same may be true for the horse . A requirement for cobalt is found only in certain bacteria and algae and they need it to produce vitamin B 12-like compounds . Vitamin B12 is not produced by higher plants and animals . Therefore , it appears that only certain microorganisms are vulnerable to a cobalt deficiency . In animals , the majority of cobalt in the body is excreted via the urine . Small amounts of cobalt are lost by way of the feces , sweat , and hair . The highest concentration of cobalt in the body occurs in the muscle , bone , and kidney , but these levels are very low . Supplementary cobalt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk if the diet already contains sufficient cobalt . However , cobalt supplementation of cobalt-deficient or cobalt-marginal diets significantly increases the vitamin B12 content of both the milk and colostrum . Information is not available on what the situation is with the horse . In dairy cattle , only about 3 ? /v of the cobalt in the diet is converted to vitamin B12 which occurs primarily in the rumen , and only I 3 ' % of the vitamin 1312 // produced is absorbed by the animal . These are very low levels of vitamin B12 synthesis and absorption . The situation in the horse is not known . XXVII . SELENIUM A. Introduction Selenium is part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase which aids in detoxification of lipo- and hydrogen peroxides which are toxic to cell membranes . The loss of unsaturated fatty acids by peroxides causes extensive damage to cell membranes and affects their permeability and function , and causes cell wall fragility . So , glutathione peroxidase protects the cells in the body from oxidative stress . Most feeds contain compounds that can form peroxides . Unsaturated fatty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of peroxides that destroy nutrients . Vitamin E , for example , is easily destroyed by rancidity . Selenium spares vitamin E by its antioxidant role as a constituent of glutathione peroxidase . There is an interrelationship between selenium and vitamin E. Both are needed by animals and both have metabolic roles in the body in addition to an antioxidant effect . In some instances , vitamin E will substitute in varying degrees for selenium , or vice versa . However , there are deficiency symptoms that respond only to selenium or to vitamin E. Although selenium can not replace vitamin E in nutrition , it reduces the amount of vitamin E required and the onset of vitamin E deficiency symptoms . Selenium may also have other functions such as in sulfur amino acid synthesis and in increasing immune response in animals ( 94a ) . The sulfur amino acids , methionine and cystine , protect against several diseases associated with low intakes of selenium and vitamin E. It is thought that this is due to their antioxidant activity . So , the sulfur amino acids can spare vitamin E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need selenium and can grow normally and produce optimum yields even though they contain an insufficient amount of selenium to meet animal requirements . Therefore , an excellent looking pasture can be deceiving and result in selenium deficiencies in horses grazing it . Selenium deficiencies are occurring more frequently throughout the United States and in all areas of the world . Selenium-deficient areas have been found in 44 U.S. states and throughout most of Canada ( Fig. 6.2 ) . Moreover , feeds produced in selenium-deficient states are shipped to other states and to many foreign countries . Therefore , selenium deficiencies are likely to occur almost anywhere . Countries that import U.S. grain and soybeans are likely to encounter selenium deficiencies , even though their soils may be adequate in selenium . This will especially he the case if their diets consist largely of imported feeds . // B. Effect of Deficiency Deficiency symptoms associated with a lack of selenium such as white muscle disease , muscular dystrophy , yellow fat disease , and others have been observed in horses . One report ( 95 ) indicated that the myopathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in suckling and swallowing , respirato-ry distress , and impaired cardiac function . Therefore , even though research information for horses is considerably less than for other animals , enough data are available to warrant selenium supplementation under most conditions . A number of reports show that a lack of selenium causes white muscle disease // or muscular dystrophy in foals ( 96 ? 99 ) . The age of onset may vary from birth or as late as 5 ? 7 months of age ( 96 ) . The affected foals show muscular stiffness , are disinclined to move , have a stiff gait and difficulty in walking , and may be unable to stand up or follow the mare to nurse . In severe cases the body temperature is elevated and the heart and respiratory rate are accelerated . The foals appear dejected , lie on their sides , and may die within a day , or death may be delayed for a week . Some of the foals may excrete myoglobin , which gives the urine a brownish color . The dead foal may show some hair loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , muscular dystrophy , and yellowish-brown fat . When blood analyses are made , they show a decreased level of blood serum selenium and a higher level of blood serum GOT ( glutamic oxalacetic transaminase ) . A few reports indicate that , when foals show these symptoms , giving the mares selenium prevents further outbreaks . If this is not possible , one report indicates that prevention of muscular dystrophy in foals can be accomplished by giving the foals 1 mg of selenium per day by oral or parenteral supplementation . Tying-up usually occurs after a few days of rest from heavy work , training , racing , or performance schedule . It causes a lameness and rigidity of the muscles in the loin area . One report ( 100 ) stated that 2 ? 5% or more of all horses at the race track may get tying-up disease . It may appear in horses of all ages . Some scientists feel that tying-up is due to excessive accumulation of lactic acid in the muscle . They feel that the oxidation , or breakdown , of the glycogen stored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lactic acid in a relatively short time . A number of studies ( 100 ? 103 ) indicate that tying-up may be related to a lack of selenium and/or vitamin E. A single injection of 25 mg of selenium and 250 mg of vitamin E will cure tying-up in most horses , but a second dose may be needed ( 100 ) . Some horses are cured quickly , whereas others may respond partially or take a longer time to respond . A small percentage of horses may not respond at all . This could be due to irreparable damage having occurred or to the dose involved or when the injection was given during the tying-up syndrome . It is apparent , however , that it is worth trying selenium and vitamin E injections in horses suffering from tying-up . Whether proper levels of selenium and vitamin E in the diet would prevent the tying-up disease is not known . There are a number of reports indicating that the tying-up syndrome does not correlate with vitamin E or selenium status ( 104 ? 106 ) . This indicates the complexity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 107 , 108 ) . Such horses have shown signs of heart failure and skeletal muscular dystrophy . In some cases the blood serum selenium levels are low and the serum vitamin E levels appear to be normal . The older horses show anorexia ( loss of appetite ) , emaciation , generalized muscular weakness , tachycardia ( rapid heart beat of 80 ? 100 heats per minute ) , and diarrhea . Enlargement of the liver , kidney , and heart is seen on necropsy . The horses also show an elevation of blood serum GOT . // C. Requirements The 1989 NRC publication indicates that the selenium requirement of the horse is estimated to be 0.1 ppm in the diet ( 5 ) . A Washington State University study ( 109 ) with 4-year-old ponies fed a dry cull pea and pea straw diet supplemented with vitamins and minerals showed that a level of 0.078 ppm selenium in the diet prevented selenium deficiency signs over a period of 217 days . It appears , on the basis of present knowledge , that a level of 0.1 ppm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table 6.11 gives the 1989 NRC requirement for selenium for the horse ( 5 ) . Table 15.10 gives the selenium level to use in a trace mineralized salt for the horse . Selenium in excess can be harmful , so one needs to be careful in its use . Selenium can be added at levels of at least 50 times the recommended level ( or 5 ppm ) before toxic effects appear ( 52 ) . Therefore , there is a wide safety margin between the level needed and that which may cause harmful effects . The 1989 NRC reported that 2 ppm is the maximal tolerable level of selenium for the horse ( 5 ) . D. General Information There are some areas of seleniferous soils in South Dakota , Wyoming , Montana , North Dakota , Nebraska , Kansas , Colorado , Utah , Arizona , and New Mexico that produce selenium-accumulator plants which are toxic to livestock ( Fig. 6.2 ) . The occurrence of the toxic selenium-accumulator plants is most widespread in Wyoming and South Dakota . However , these accumulator plants probably add very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow in dry nonagricultural areas according to the 1983 NRC publication on " Selenium in Nutrition . " The publication also states that the impact of the selenium-accumulator plants on the livestock industry in the seleniferous areas is small because of the widespread adoption of practical techniques for controlling the problem . Generally , higher levels of protein , sulfur , and arsenilic acids will partially protect against a toxicity of selenium . Selenium is eliminated rapidly from the body when animals are fed a low-selenium diet . One should avoid using highlevel selenium diets , however . The amount of selenium used should be close to the requirement level . In the horse , a toxicity of selenium results in a loss of condition , erosion of the long bones , elongation and cracking of hooves , and a partial or total loss of hair in the mane and tail ( 111 ) . Acute selenium toxicity ( blind staggers ) is characterized by apparent blindness , head pressing , perspiration , abdominal pain , colic , diarrhea , increased heart and respiration rates , ; Ind lethargy ( 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is characterized by // alopecia , especially about the mane and tail , as well as cracking of the hooves around the coronary band ( 5 , 112 ) . The selenium available to plants varies a great deal among soils from different locations . Moreover , the total selenium level in soils does not accurately predict how much of it is available to plants . Almost all of the selenium excreted by animals in the feces and urine is in an insoluble form that is unavailable to plants . The major selenium compounds in seeds or forages consumed by livestock appear to be selenocystine , selenocysteine , selenomethionine , and selenium methyl-selenomethionine . Selenium supplements which are added to animal diets are mainly sodium selenite and sodium selenate . There are considerable differences in the availability of selenium in various feeds . Data in Table 6.13 were recalculated by Dr. G. F. Combs , Jr. , of Cornell University from earlier data obtained by Dr. M. L. Scott and others at Cornell . The data shown in Table 6.13 indicate that feeds of plant origin are much higher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ se lenium in alfalfa meal and brewer 's grains has the highest availability . Sodium selenite and sodium selenate have the highest availability of the inorganic se lenium compounds . The data shown in Table 6.13 show that analysis of feeds for total selenium // can be misleading . It means that many diets thought to be adequate in selenium may be deficient when the availability of selenium is considered . This accounts for more selenium deficiencies being detected . Moreover , the use of new highly refined and sensitive chemical methods make it possible to determine very low levels of selenium in feeds and body tissues . This has made it possible to determine the selenium-deficient feeds and areas where they occur and thus more adequately evaluate the selenium status in an area . XXVIII . POTASSIUM A. Introduction Potassium , along with sodium and chloride , occur largely in the fluids and soft tissues of the body . All three minerals function in osmotic pressure and acid ? base balance which is very important in the passage of diet nutrients into body cells as well as in body water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sodium , and chloride since it has very little storage capacity for them and an excessive intake is rapidly excreted . For optimum health and normal operation of the body system , the pH of the blood and other body fluids must be maintained within a narrow range . Fortunately , the body has a very effective buffering system which maintains the blood pH within normal levels even when feeds react as either alkaline or acid . Urine excretion of excessive alkaline or acid products is one means of accomplishing this . But , there are limits to how much the acid ? base balance can vary before it starts affecting the performance of the animal . Unfortunately , there is still too little known about acid ? base balance and methods to keep it in the best equilibrium for optimum health and performance of the horse . In addition , potassium has many other important functions in the body . It activates and functions as a cofactor in a number of enzyme systems which include energy transfer and utilization , oxygen and carbon dioxide transport in blood , protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nerve and muscle function . Muscle tissue has the highest concentration ( 56% ) of potassium in the body . B. Effect of Deficiency A summary of potassium deficiency symptoms which occur in all animals are as follows : decreased growth rate , decreased feed intake , muscular weakness , stiffness and paralysis , heart abnormalities such as cardiac arrhythmias , intracellular acidosis , degeneration of vital body organs , and nervous disorder . Only a limited amount of potassium research has been conducted with the horse . A // study at the University of Kentucky ( 113 ) showed that young foals deficient in potassium had a reduced feed intake , decreased rate of growth , unthrifty appearance , and hypokalemia ( decreased blood serum level of potassium ) . A study with ponies at Cornell University ( 114 ) showed that the small intestine appears to be the greatest site of potassium absorption but a significant amount is also absorbed from the large intestine . The kidney was the primary pathway of potassium excretion . C. Requirement A Cornell University study ( 115 ) showed that the maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kg of body weight . This is equivalent to about 0.4% of potassium in the diet . This requirement does not include sweat and dermal ( skin ) losses plus increased needs for performance . They stated that the total potassium requirement of the horse is probably less than 0.6% of the diet . Until more data become available , they indicated that the use of 0.6% potassium in the diet appears reasonable . But , they also stated that the need for potassium for top level performing horses may be even higher because of the extra potassium they lose in the sweat and the fact there are reports that their blood potassium levels can be quite low . In a study at the University of Kentucky ( 116 ) it was recommended that foals ( 1 ? 3-months old ) fed a purified diet should have 1.0% potassium in the diet in order to have normal levels of various blood constituents . Table 6.5 gives the 1989 NRC recommendations on the potassium requirement of the horse ( 5 ) . The potassium requirement level varies from 0.3 to 0.43% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during intense work and with lactating mares ( 0.42% ) from foaling to 3 months of lactation . D. General Information Many factors can increase potassium needs . Vomiting or diarrhea or loss of electrolytes during dysentery , scours or hauling to various locations may increase potassium needs . Stress conditions such as weather , hard work or performance , diseases , injury , sweating , high water intake and other factors can cause potassium depletion and increased needs . The effect of hot weather in increasing potassium needs of high producing dairy cows has been shown recently by University of Florida and Texas A &; M scientists . The University of Florida studies showed that high producing dairy cows also needed higher levels of potassium and sodium than previously recommended in order to milk to their full genetic potential . This is reasonable to expect since potassium is the most abundant mineral element in milk ( 1.5% ) and sodium is also contained in milk at a high level . These studies with dairy cows // should be considered as one evaluates the potassium needs of the horse . Highlevel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress during performance and training . Moreover , they sweat considerably more than other classes of livestock , and significant amounts of potassium are lost in sweat . The high milk producing mare should also need adequate potassium intake in order to milk to her full genetic potential . This discussion indicates the need to obtain more information on the potassium needs of the horse . At the University of Florida , a potassium deficiency with high producing dairy cows resulted in dramatic reductions in feed and water intake , milk yield , and blood potassium concentrations within 3 ? 5 days after feeding a potassiumdeficient diet . A near-complete loss of appetite and vigor , a craving for unnatural feeds ( pica ) , and death of three cows occurred . The rapid deficiency effects show the lack of potassium storage in the body . Giving the deficient cows potassium reversed the condition within 12 ? 24 hours . If the stress of lactation is combined with heat stress , then the potassium requirement appears to be greater . High humidity would further increase sweating at high temperatures . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potassium in horse diets . A periodic decrease in potassium intake because of diet inadequacy would adversely affect optimum health and performance in the horse . The blood serum concentration of potassium does not always reflect the proper potassium balance . Much body potassium can be lost before the serum level decreases . There are some reasons for this . The main one is that potassium may shift from inside the body cells to the fluid outside the cells and thus keep up the level of potassium in the blood serum . But , the animal 's body system could be short of potassium . Research at the University of Nebraska showed that dry winter ranges result in forages very low in potassium ( 117 ) . Some of the forages contained as little as 0.09 ? 0.10% potassium . We need to know if this is the case in other areas with dry range forages . A recent cooperative study between the Tennessee and Texas Agricultural Experiment Stations showed that increasing the potassium concentration from I to 1.5% in the diet of steers that were stressed by shipping resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 28 days in a feedlot in Texas . Potassium is concerned with water balance in the body and considerable body water loss occurs during shipping cattle . This study should be followed by others to verify the role of potassium in helping to minimize shipping stress and losses with horses . While the research data cited above are with cattle grazing dry range forages low in potassium , this finding should alert horse owners and research scientists to determine whether or not horses might be affected similarly if grazing such forages or if consuming hay made from the forages . Cornell scientists found that an increased intake of potassium did not inlluXXIX. // ence the digestibility or retention of calcium , phosphorus , or magnesium ( 118 ) . A high level of calcium ( 3.4% in the diet ) did not influence potassium retention or digestibility . They studied three levels of magnesium to determine its effect on potassium digestibility . The levels of magnesium were 0.16 , 0.31 , and 0.81% of the diet . The highest level of magnesium ( 0.81% ) increased potassium absorption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cornell scientists stated that it appears unlikely that high levels of calcium or magnesium would induce a potassium deficiency in the horse . There have been no reports of potassium toxicity in the horse ( 25 ) but excessive levels should be avoided . There seems to be an antagonism between sodium and potassium . Excess sodium increases potassium needs by causing more of it to be excreted by the kidneys . Excess potassium likewise has the same effect on sodium excretion . This theory is believed to be true , but some scientists question whether it always occurs . Pasture grass sometimes contains 18 times as much potassium as sodium . If this ratio of potassium to sodium causes excess sodium excretion , it emphasizes the need to make sure that the horse gets enough sodium . Potassium loss accompanies persistent diarrhea . Young animals with diarrhea develop acidosis and a potassium deficit more rapidly than mature animals . Their metabolic rate is greater and their kidneys do not conserve potassium as well . XXIX . MAGNESIUM A. Introduction It is estimated that about 60 ? 70% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bone contains about 0.75% magnesium . Magnesium is closely associated with calcium and phosphorus and serves as a constituent of bone . Very little is known , however , as to the actual function of magnesium in bone . It must have some function since a lack of magnesium in the diet causes weak pasterns in the pig and leg weakness in some other animals . About 30 ? 35% of the magnesium in the body occurs in the fluids and soft tissues where magnesium has a vital role in certain enzyme systems . It activates enzymes which transfer phosphate to various compounds and thus influences most , if not all , metabolic processes in the body . So , magnesium is important in almost all functions in the body . B. Effect of Deficiency Symptoms of a deficiency of magnesium include nervousness , muscular tremors , ataxia followed by collapse , with hyperpnea , ( hard breathing ) , sweating , convulsive paddling of legs and , in some cases , death ( 119 , 120 ) . A Kentucky // study with foals showed degeneration in the lung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the heart aorta ( 121 , 122 ) . Skeletal muscle degeneration was consistently found in all the foals fed the magnesium-deficient diet for 71 days or longer , although it was not extensive . In this study , a sharp decrease in blood serum magnesium levels was detected within 24 ? 48 hours after the foals were given the magnesium-deficient diet . The University of Kentucky study ( 121 , 122 ) showed that the amount of magnesium which can be mobilized from bone depends on the age of the horse and the rate of bone growth . Magnesium availability from bone decreases with age and may be as low as 2% in adult animals . There are also differences in the sensitivity of various bones to depletion of their magnesium level . The Kentucky study with horses showed that the rate of reduction of bone magnesium varied not only between different bones but between different areas of the same bone . A number of studies with different animals show that the young animal can mobilize about a third of the magnesium from bone during periods of inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnesium deficiency frequently show little or no depletion of bone magnesium . Present information , therefore , would indicate that bone is not a reliable source of magnesium if the animal diet lacks this mineral during certain periods . C. Requirement Cornell studies showed that the horse requires about 13 mg/kg bodyweight daily of magnesium for maintenance ( 123 ) and the pony requires 12.8 mg/kg bodyweight for the same purpose . The 1989 NRC ( 5 ) recommends that 0.09 to 0.13% magnesium in the diet ( dry matter basis ) for all classes of horses ( Table 6.5 ) . On a 90% dry matter basis , the 1989 NRC report ( 5 ) recommends from 0.08 to 0.12% magnesium for all classes of horses ( Table 6.6 ) . D. General Information Grass tetany is increasing in frequency throughout the United States . Just a few years ago , tetany was thought to be a problem only in a few areas . Under certain conditions , the magnesium in forages decreases in availability to a very low level for ruminants . Sometimes only 5% of the magnesium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the horse is not known . However , since horses consume about 50% of their total feed as forage , it is important to be on the lookout for this possibility occurring . The 1973 NRC publication ( 53 ) on nutrient requirements of the horse stated : " Outbreaks of tetany that respond to magnesium therapy have been reported from humid grassland areas . The addition of 5 ' / , magnesium oxide to the salt mixture has been a helpful protective n e : sure . " The // 1989 NRC states that pastures that are conducive to magnesium deficiency , tetany , and death in ruminants do not affect horses similarly . Studies by Cornell University ( 123 ) showed that the main site of magnesium absorption in the horse is the small intestine . The lower half of the small intestine appears to be more effective in absorbing magnesium than the upper half . Small amounts of magnesium may also be absorbed from the large intestine . About 5% of the magnesium absorption occurred in the cecum , dorsal colon , and small colon . Diets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet with 20% milk products absorbed more magnesium than horses fed linseed meal . This would indicate that milk products may enhance magnesium absorption or that the magnesium of milk products is more available than that of linseed meal . The addition of lysine to linseed meal did not improve magnesium absorption . Magnesium is excreted in both the feces and the urine , but the major part is excreted in the feces . An excessive intake of calcium will increase the excretion of magnesium in the urine . Therefore , excess calcium in the diet or water will increase magnesium requirement . Excess potassium may also increase magnesium needs . This is due to a decreased absorption or increased excretion of magnesium or both . It appears , therefore , that excess intake of calcium and phosphorus ( and possibly potassium ) can increase the requirements for magnesium . It has also been shown that a moderate excess of magnesium , in a mineral supplement , feed , or water , will not markedly disturb calcium retention , although it may tend to slightly increase the requirements for calcium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance between calcium , phosphorus , and magnesium is necessary . Magnesium oxide has about 53% magnesium , whereas magnesium carbonate has 28.8% magnesium ; magnesium chloride has 12.0% magnesium , and magnesium sulfate has 9.9% magnesium . So , magnesium oxide has the highest percentage of magnesium . The form of magnesium to use would depend on the way it is to be used , its availability for the horse , and the cost per unit of magnesium . There are no controlled studies on the effect of excess magnesium on the horse . Although the maximum tolerable level of magnesium in the diet for the horse was estimated to be 0.3% ( from data on other species ) by NRC ( 124 ) some alfalfa hays with magnesium levels of 0.5% have been fed to horses without apparent ill effects in Cornell studies ( 125 ) . XXX . MOLYBDENUM A. Introduction Molybdenum is an essential nutrient since it is a constituent of the enzyme xanthinc oxidase as well as several other enzymes . The level of molybdenum // required is very low , which makes it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the concern with molybdenum is when it occurs at excessive levels in the soil and feed . Molybdenum occurs in soils , plant , and animal tissues . The molybdenum level of forages used for grazing can vary a great deal and is affected by soil molybdenum level , soil pH , and season of the year , as well as by contamination by industrial and mine wastes . The highest and the most variable level of molybdenum in feeds fed to animals occurs in legumes and their seeds . Usually , the molybdenum level of mixed pastures varies according to the proportion of legumes in the forage . The level of molybdenum in many forages increases steadily during the growing season . It is known that alkaline soils increase molybdenum availability but decrease copper availability to the plant . Therefore , alkaline soils increase the severity of the problem in areas of excess molybdenum . Soil wetness in poorly drained soils may also increase the molybdenum level in the forages produced there . Forages usually contain levels of 3 ? 5 ppm of molybdenum which is considered about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forages may contain 20 ? 100 ppm of molybdenum and sometimes as high as 200 ppm . With ruminants , a copper deficiency may occur when forages have a copper level below 5 ppm and the molybdenum levels goes above the 3 ? 5 ppm level . In areas of excess molybdenum one can usually counteract the excess molybdenum by increasing the copper level in the diet by 2 ? 3 times the required level with ruminants . But , sometimes higher copper levels are needed , depending on the many interrelationships of molybdenum ? copper ? sulfates ? other nutrients ? type of soil and the kind of diet being fed . It is a complex matter with no exact answers yet . B. Effects of Deficiency There are species differences in the response to excess molybdenum . Cattle are the least tolerant , followed by sheep , whereas horses and pigs are the most tolerant farm animals . The high tolerance of horses is apparent since they have not shown symptoms of molybdenum toxicity on pastures that severely affected cattle . But , foals have been reported to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 ) . This could be due to the high molybdenum level causing some disturbance in phosphorus metabolism , which has occurred in cattle and sheep in some areas , or it could be due to a lack of copper or to a lack of both copper and phosphorus . Symptoms obtained with cattle due to molybdenum toxicity include the following : weight loss ; scouring ; disturbance in phosphorus metabolism giving rise to lameness ; joint abnormalities ; osteoporosis ; high serum phosphate levels ; difficulties in conceiving ; lack of libido in males ; and damage to the testes and // spermatogenesis . Connective tissue changes and some spontaneous bone fractures have also been observed in sheep on high-molybdenum pastures . Since cattle and sheep suffer bone abnormalities with high molybdenum intake levels , it is not surprising that foals have been reported to suffer from rickets when their dams were on high-molybdenum pastures . It appears that copper has a role in proper bone metabolism . Dr. E. A. Ott , at the University of Florida , showed that copper enhances bone mineralization in growing horses ( 78 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit apparent harmful effects from grazing highmolybdenum pastures ( which were very harmful to cattle ) their foals showed the effects . It is known that the molybdenum content in the milk of cows , ewes , and goats reflects the level of molybdenum in the diet . It is not known if the mare 's milk would also reflect the diet molybdenum level . But , if it did , it may account for the foals showing rickets when consuming both the mare 's milk and forage both of which were high in molybdenum . It has also been reported that molybdenum accumulates in the equine liver and that it may cause rickets in foals grazing pastures containing 5 ? 25 ppm of molybdenum ( 81 ) . It may be logical to assume , therefore , that even though mares may not show apparent harmful effects when grazing high-molybdenum forages that the foals may be adversely affected . This possibility should be explored in high-molybdenum areas . C. Requirement There is no known requirement for molybdenum in horse diets . It appears that the adequacy of copper in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The 1989 NRC recommends a level of 10 ppm of copper in the diet of horses ( 5 ) . This level might be increased somewhat to counteract the high-molybdenum forage . Copper should not be increased more than 2 ? 3 times the normal requirement for horses . Since horses appear to be more tolerant to excess molybdenum than cattle , doubling the copper requirement might be adequate to counteract reasonable levels of excess molybdenum in the forage . Studies at Cornell ( 82 ) showed that the addition of molybdenum to the diet of ponies decreased copper absorption and retention and caused increased dietary copper in the feces and increased excretion of absorbed copper in the bile . Therefore , copper needs were increased by molybdenum in the diet . Urinary excretion of molybdenum by ponies effectively removed most of the absorbed molybdenum ( 81 ) . Doubling , or even tripling , the copper level in the diet should not be harmful since the horse has been fed 791 ppm of copper in the diet with no apparent adverse effect ( 75 ) . But , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excess molybdenum level . It is always piudcnt to avoid feeding nutrients much above required levels . // D. General Information Under normal conditions , the liver contains about 4 ppm of molybdenum . This level can increase to 25 ? 30 ppm with excess molybdenum intake . The level in the liver returns to normal when excess molybdenum intake ceases . If the excess molybdenum intake is prolonged , a depletion of tissue copper levels occurs and a deficiency of copper results . If the sulfate intake is high , it helps counteract the effect of high molybdenum levels in the forage . The degree of molybdenum absorption and retention in the body tissues is decreased by the sulfates . This means that if the copper intake of the diet is about normal , the sulfates can counteract a slight excess of molybdenum . The high levels of molybdenum in the liver decline rapidly if the molybdenum intake decreases and the copper and sulfate in the diet is increased . There are limits , however , to the extent that sulfur sources decrease the adverse effects of increased levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain level , the sulfide sulfur formed within the intestinal tract or in body tissues may actually exacerbate the effects of high molybdenum . This further complicates the molybdenum ? copper ? sulfate interrelationship . But , with few exceptions , the sulfate ion , whether it originates in the diet or from sulfur amino acid ( cystine and methionine ) breakdown in the body , limits molybdenum uptake , increases its excretion , and therefore increases the animal 's tolerance to a high molybdenum level in the diet . Understanding molybdenum and its effect on animals is still a very complex matter . There is the interrelationship between molybdenum , copper , and sulfur . But , dietary protein , zinc , iron , vitamin E , vitamin C , lead , and tungstate have all been reported to affect the level of molybdenum in tissues . It should be noted that not all manifestations of molybdenum toxicity are due to a lack of copper . In certain situations , and with different species of animals , symptoms occur which are not typical of a copper deficiency . This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molybdenum ? coppersulfate relationship . XXXI . SULFUR No information is available on the sulfur needs of the horse . Sulfur is an important constituent in the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cystine . It is also present in insulin and in the vitamins , thiamin and biotin , as well as in heparin and chondroitin sulfate . If the diet is adequate in protein , it will usually provide at least 0.15% sulfur . According to the 1989 NRC , the 0.15% sulfur level in the diet appears to be adequate ( 5 ) . Table 6.1 I gives the 1989 NRC recommendation on sulfur requirement for the horse ( 5 ) . One report ( 126 ) noted harmful effects from excess sulfur accidentally fed to 5 ? 12-year-old horses at a level of 200 ? 400 g of flowers of ' sulfur which contains over 99 ' / sulfur . Two of the 12 horses died following convulsions. // XXXII . FLUORINE A. Introduction Many scientists classify fluorine as an essential mineral element since it is beneficial to teeth and decreases tooth decay . The big problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather an excess . B. Effect of Excess Fluorine Utah State University scientists ( 127 ) reported that horses with moderate to marked fluorosis appeared unthrifty even when they had an ample supply of good-quality feed ( Fig. 6.3 ) . The hair coat was rough and dry in appearance , and the horse 's winter coat was slow to shed in the spring . The skin became taut and // was less pliable than normal . When tooth abrasion and wear became excessive , feed utilization became poor and " slobbering " of poorly masticated feed was common . As the deficiency increased and horses developed marked clinical fluorosis , they became lame and were unable to walk , run , or jump normally ( Fig. 6.4 ) . They took shortened steps and , then , only reluctantly . The horses ' lameness frequently intensified with use , exercise , or work . Even when the affected horses were not worked , there was apparent pain , since these animals often stood with their feet in unnatural positions with one forefoot placed in front of the other . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if // they were trying to relieve the pain . Many of the horses examined had severe dental fluorosis with excessive wear of the teeth and abrasion ( Fig. 6.5 ) . The teeth were irregular and uneven . These irregularities resulted in poor chewing of the feed as well as occasional biting and injury to the surface of the cheek and gum . As the teeth became more affected , some of the teeth broke down and allowed feed material to be forced through the hole in the teeth and into the pulp cavity . This material formed abscesses . These horses then developed a lumpy jaw appearance ( Fig. 6.6 ) . Bones are affected by excessive fluorine intake . The jaw bones often become thickened . Bones in the nose often thicken and cause a " Roman nose " appearance . In severe chronic fluorine cases , all bones are affected to some degree . The bones appear chalky white with a rough , irregular surface and are thicker than normal bones . Fluorine has a remarkable affinity for deposition in the bone . The amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without causing any apparent // changes in structure and function . However , once a certain level of fluorine deposition occurs , toxic effects take place and are more apparent . Fluorosis in horses can be diagnosed clinically by well-qualified persons . If excess fluorine intake occurs during the period of tooth formation , the teeth will show a mottled enamel . This condition is characterized by chalky-white patches on the surface of the teeth . The teeth may become stained and show a discolora-tion which varies from yellow to black . This mottling is primarily a defect of the permanent teeth , which occurs during their formation . However , if the perma-nent teeth are already in , this mottling does not occur . This can be seen when older horses , with their permanent teeth , are brought into an area or situation where excess fluorine intake occurs . // The studies by Utah State University ( 127 ) show that lesions of fluorosis develop in horses in a similar way to cattle , sheep , and other animals . The teeth and bones are the major sites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones and teeth , although no harm is immediately apparent . Approx imately 99% of the excess fluoride retained in the body is stored in the bone . This deposition of fluorine in the bone is nature 's way of protecting the soft body tissues against excessive fluorine deposition . However , once the bones become saturated with fluorine , the unabsorbed fluorine is free to produce its toxic effects on the various organs and soft tissues in the body . Growth , reproduction , lacta tion and the well-being of the animal are interfered with . // C. Safe Level of Fluorides The safe level of fluoride intake is shown in Table 6.14 . These are the levels recommended by the 1974 NRC report on " Effect of Fluorides in Animals " ( 22 ) . The values in Table 6.14 are presented as ppm in diet dry matter . In the first column , the values reflect the use of a soluble fluoride such as NaF . In the second column , it is assumed the fluoride in the diet is present as some form of defluori nated rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance level is increased by 50% . This is because the fluoride in NaF is more readily absorbed and sometimes is twice as toxic as the fluoride in rock phosphate . Since NaF is not always twice as toxic , a figure of 50% increased toxicity is used . The fluoride tolerance levels shown in Table 6.14 assume that fluoride is being continually ingested by the animal . It is not known what the tolerance level // would be if an intermittent intake of fluoride or varying levels were consumed periodically . The majority of feed grade phosphates that originate from rock phosphate deposits have fluoride levels ranging from 2 to 5% and average about 3.5% . In the United States , a phosphate that is to be classified as defluorinated phosphate must contain no more than 1 part of fluorine to 100 parts of phosphorus ( see Table 6.8 ) . The information shown in Table 6.8 can be used as a guide in determining the calcium and phosphorus levels of various phosphorus sources for horse feeding . Moreover , the fluorine levels can be used as a guide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding . A level of up to 60 ppm of fluorine in the total diet of the horse has been established as safe by the NRC Committee on Fluorine for Animals ( 22 ) . Although evidence is not available , the committee also stated that " it is felt that Thoroughbreds , Quarter horses and other breeds being trained and developed for racing at an early age , during the period of rapid bone growth , may have a lower tolerance for fluoride in the diet . " The 1989 NRC states that horses can tolerate 50 ppm of fluorine in the diet for extended periods without detrimental effects ( 5 ) . This level has been fed to horses for extended periods by Utah State University scientists ( 127 ) without any detrimental effects . Horses evidently are more tolerant of excess fluorine than cattle . XXXIII . SELF-FEEDING MINERALS Many horse people do not self-feed minerals . They feel that using a feed that has all the minerals needed by the horse means there is no need to self-feed extra minerals . This is the best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same amount of feed , have the same mineral requirements , and are fed the same level and quality of pasture and/or hay . Horses vary in their mineral requirements depending on their heredity or breeding , their rate of growth , level of exercise or work , reproduction rate , level of milk production , level of total feed intake , quality of the hay or pasture consumed , level of minerals in the water , and how much they drink of it , plus many other factors . Therefore , there is considerable variation in the minerals needed by individual horses . This means a diet may not supply all the minerals needed by every horse under all conditions . The concentrate mixture ( or feed that has the minerals added ) can come close to meeting the mineral needs of many horses if it is properly developed for a particular situation . There is considerable variation in the level of concentrate mixture fed to horses . Some are fed very little or no concentrates at various periods of the year . Moreover , the concentrate mixtures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various stages of maturity . Some horses will be on grass , others on grass legume pastures , and some on just an exercise area // ( since the pasture contains very little or no vegetation ) . Moreover , there is a large variation in the amount and quality of hay fed . Therefore , the mineral content and intake from pasture and hay varies a great deal . Since pasture and/or hay usually make up at least one-half of the total feed intake of horses , it is apparent their affect on the level of minerals needed in the concentrate mixture is substantial . Salt needs , for example , will depend to some extent on how much a horse is worked or exercised . A horse worked moderately can lose 50 ? 60 g of salt in the sweat and 35 g in the urine . Sweat contains about 0.7% salt . Unless this lost salt is replaced , the horse will soon show signs of fatigue or overheating just as the human does . This is why it is so important to self-feed salt to horses so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a Michigan study ( 51 ) , it was found that the horse consuming the most salt ate 12 times as much salt as the lowest consumer . See Sections XIXG 1 and XXB for problems involved in developing complete mineral mixtures to be self-fed to horses . It is a complex matter since the mineral mixture must be formulated to meet approximate needs and must not be under- or overconsumed by the horse . There is some objection to the use of a mineral box because of the possibility of injury if a horse runs into it , although experience has shown that this is a rare occurrence . This possibility can be eliminated by placing the mineral box in a corner of the pasture , pen , or stall . It is preferable to use a plastic rather than a wooden mineral box to preclude the possibility of head injury . The added benefits in better mineral nutrition and superior performance and reproduction would more than pay for any cost or inconvenience involved with self-feeding minerals to horses . XXXIV . WHY HORSES EAT DIRT OR CHEW WOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eat dirt and chew wood and other objects . Therefore , the first step is to prevent this from occurring and to make sure the diet is adequate in minerals . However , the addition of the known essential mineral elements to the diet will not always solve the problem . For example , pigs on well-balanced diets will chew each other 's tails . Some producers have cut their pigs ' tails off at birth . When this is done , some of the pigs start chewing each other 's ears and other parts of the body . No one definite remedy will eliminate this problem . Giving the pig more space , placing a tire or some other object in the pen for it to play with , and other management improvements will minimize the problem . Some horses chew each other 's tails when they are fed only a completely pelleted diet . This may be due to a lack of enough pasture or hay . It could he due to a lack of some minerals , or it could be due to some other factors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood . Some of it may be due to boredom . Even under the best of nutrition and management conditions , chewing wood and eating dirt occurs with some animals ( see Fig. 6.9 ) . Why it happens is not known . Maybe there are some minerals lacking that we do not think are needed by animals . Maybe some animals have higher nutritional requirements than others , while others may have just developed bad habits . We know that soil has some factor ( or factors ) that benefits the pig fed all the essential mineral elements . Therefore , we need to keep an open mind on the possible need for minerals , or other factors , we think do not need to be added to livestock diets at the present time . Reports that cadmium , chromium , molybdenum , vanadium , tin , and other new trace mineral elements that have metabolic roles in the body have appeared . They may be involved in the problem of wood chewing and eating dirt under some conditions . At least we should eliminate that possibility . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but making sure horses have an adequate mineral intake and a well-balanced diet is very important . One also needs to look at housing and management . Housing is // usually based on our preferences , without taking into consideration a horse 's likes and dislikes . Maybe part of the problem is that the horse is bored or dissatisfied with its housing and management . Until this is taken into consideration , wood chewing , eating dirt , breeding problems , and handling problems may persist . XXXV . HAIR ANALYSIS AS NUTRITIONAL INDICATOR Horse owners and trainers are interested in whether hair analyses can be used as an indicator of the nutritional adequacy of the horse . In fact , many are routinely obtaining blood and hair analyses periodically throughout the year . As one considers this matter there are a number of questions that need to be answered . The first is where to take the hair sample from the horse 's body . This should be studied to determine if it is the same area for the various nutrients . It may be that certain parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any difference in analysis of hair that is regrowing , after being clipped , compared to hair that has never been clipped should be studied . The best indicator might be hair that is regrowing . The age of the animal may also influence the level of minerals in hair . Another unanswered question is how to treat the hair that is being clipped for analysis . Should it be brushed to take out the dirt and sweat that has accumulated on it ? If so , how should this be done to get the best hair sample for analysis . One might want to wash the hair . If this is done , how should one do it to prevent the nutrients from being washed out of the hair ? Which solvents should be used ? These questions are important if one is to get a hair analysis that represents what the hair itself contains . One does not want to analyze the dirt and sweat in the hair since it can vary greatly , nor does one want to lose nutrients from the hair by washing it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . This could be due to changes in environmental temperature or to hormonal changes that occur during the year . The effect of the season on hair analysis has already been shown for certain nutrients ( 128 ) . Therefore , one has to follow a regular system of analysis with at least one ( and possibly more ) analysis during each season of the year . This means one can not take just one hair sample , analyze it , and expect to have a good evaluation of the nutritional status of the horse . There will be differences in results obtained in hair analyses between animals . This has been shown to be the case particularly for calcium and phosphorus . Therefore , results obtained with other animals can not be relied upon to he the same for horses , but should be used primarily as a guide . I lair color may affect certain minerals in hair . Cornell showed that colored hair from pinto ponies had // higher levels of calcium than did white hair taken from the same ponies ( 129 ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both colors of hair . Horse owners and trainers are interested in hair analyses because it would save having to obtain blood samples . They prefer not to use a needle in their horses unless they have to . If hair analyses are similar to blood analyses , they could sometimes be used as an indicator of the nutritional status . It seems logical to assume that the horses blood supply is the main source of the nutrients that are deposited in the hair . Blood analyses sometimes will not show a nutrient as being low in the diet until a severe deficiency exists . Therefore , if the blood supply of a nutrient is adequate , it may also be adequate in the hair , since the hair obtains these nutrients from the blood . This discussion does not imply that hair analyses should not be studied they should . Hair analyses may be a good indicator for certain nutrients . This discussion should emphasize , however , that much needs to be learned about this type of analytical work . It should be done properly if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a guide on the nutritional status of their horses . One study at Louisiana ( 130 ) indicated it was doubtful whether hair analyses could be used to determine the calcium and phosphorus status of the horse . Another study at Virginia Polytechnic Institute ( 128 ) involved studies on phosphorus supplementation of horses . Their analytical work on hair showed that phosphorus supplementation increased the phosphorus level in the hair of the weanlings but not in the mares . A Cornell study ( 38 ) showed that excess molybdenum increased hair molybdenum concentration , but did not influence the level of copper and iron . They were not able to make any conclusions concerning the effect of excess molybdenum on hair calcium or phosphorus . G. J. Fosmire , Pennsylvania State University ( 129 ) , stated that " hair analysis is not only inaccurate but also misleading in the nutritional assessment of a given individual human , and the technique should not be used as a routine measure for assessing nutritional status . " It is evident that much more needs to be learned before hair analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the horse . XXXVI . CONCLUSIONS As soils decline in fertility , new minerals may need to be added to horse diets . Looks can he deceiving as to the nutritional adequacy of a beautiful looking pasture . Plants do not need selenium , iodine , and cobalt , and sodium is essential only for certain plants . Moreover , certain plants grow normally and produce optimum yields even though the level of ' these four and other essential minerals // are not adequate for the horse . Declining soil fertility , increased horse productivi ty , and intensified and confined conditions increase the need to supply adequate minerals in the diet . Mineral interrelationships , availability , chemical and physical form of miner als , mineral processing methods , and acid ? base balance affect the mineral needs of the horse . Mineral requirements are a very complex matter and much remains to be learned about the these requirements in the horse . The 14 essential mineral elements are calcium , phosphorus , potassium , mag nesium , sulfur , sodium , chlorine , copper , iron , iodine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deficiency signs , requirements , their role in body metabolism , and general information are provided on each essential mineral element for the horse . Bone is not static once it is formed . There is a continuous interchange of calcium and phosphorus between the bone , the blood supply , and other parts of the body . So one needs to provide the horse with its mineral needs continually throughout its lifetime . Bone consists not only of calcium and phosphorus but other minerals , protein , vitamins , and other nutrients . Therefore , sound bone requires a well-balanced diet . Excess molybdenum in forages may be a problem with foals whose dams graze these pastures . Extra copper supplementation may counteract the excess molybdenum but more information is needed . Excess fluorine in the diet needs to be avoided since it is harmful to teeth , bones , and various organs and tissues of the body . Safe levels of fluorine and molybdenum are recommended . Formulating complete mineral mixture for self-feeding to horses is a complex and challenging area . The mixtures must be designed to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overconsumed by the horse . Horses eat dirt and chew wood . Some factors causing it are known but others are not . Very little is known regarding the use of hair analyses as an indicator of the adequacy of nutrients in the diet . More needs to be learned before hair analysis can be used as a reliable indicator of nutrient adequacy . // // 7 Protein and Amino Acid Requirements I. INTRODUCTION Protein generally refers to crude protein , which is defined for feedstuffs as the nitrogen content x 6.25 . This definition is based on the assumption that the nitrogen content is 16 g of nitrogen per 100 g of protein . In general this is accurate enough for feedstuffs , but there are certain proteins in which the nitrogen content varies considerably from 16% . Proteins are made up of many amino acids combined with one another . Protein in the diet is not required as such , but it is needed as a source of essential ( now usually referred to as indispensable ) amino acids and nitrogen for nonessential ( now usually referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put together in various combinations to form body proteins , and are often referred to as the building blocks of proteins . Every protein has a definite amino acid composition and no two are alike . Amino acids contain nitrogen combined with carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , and sometimes sulfur , phosphorus , and iron . The nitrogen is in the form of an amino group ( NH2 ) ; it is from this that the name amino acid is derived . Amino acids are commercially synthesized , and a few are available in large quantities . A lack of protein is frequently a limiting factor in the diet . This is because farm grains and their by-products are deficient in both quantity and quality of protein for horses . And since protein supplements are usually more expensive feeds , some people still tend to feed too little protein . Animals continually use protein either to build new tissues , as in growth and reproduction , or to repair worn out tissues . Thus , horses require a regular intake of protein . If adequate protein is lacking in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of weight . Ultimately , protein will be withdrawn from certain tissues to maintain the functions of the more vital tissues of the body as long as possible . Protein is needed to form milk , muscle , hide , hoof , hair , hormones , enzymes , blood cells , and other constituents in the body . Thus , protein affects almost every body function . It has been shown also that animals are more resistant to infections if they are fed an adequate protein diet . This is because the compounds in the bloodstream that help resist disease are proteins . So , adequate protein in the diet is one way of helping keep animals resistant to disease . // More emphasis is now placed on amino acid requirements rather than on protein needs since protein is not required per se . But , protein level is still used and is a good guide for meeting amino acid needs ( 1 ) . Protein is not stored for later use as some other nutrients are . Thus , a proteindeficient diet should not be fed for any length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of a mixture of many different proteins . Each feed ingredient , such as a grain , a protein supplement , or a hay , contains many different kinds of protein . The proteins that the horse consumes are digested or broken down to amino acids in the digestive tract . There are differences in the digestibility of proteins . They can result from structural differences in the proteins as they occur naturally in the feed or from variation in processing treatment . The temperature used in processing protein supplements can affect the amino acid availability . For example , too low as well as too high a temperature during processing can adversely affect amino acid digestibility . II . AMINO ACIDS There are 22 different amino acids . Proteins are made up of many amino acids in different combinations . The various combinations and the different levels of amino acids are what characterize proteins and make one different from another . For example , one protein may have hundreds of amino acids , whereas another may have thousands of amino acids in its molecular makeup . Some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dispensable amino acids are so named because they can be synthesized in adequate amounts in the body and do not need to be supplied from an outside source . This means they are dispensable as constituents of a diet . However , they are essential to the animal after they are synthesized in the body . Physiologically , all amino acids found in animal tissues are essential otherwise tissue could not be formed . The indispensable amino acids are synthesized at too low a level , or not at all , by the body and , hence , a certain amount must be supplied preformed in the diet . This means they are an essential part of the diet and must be included at adequate levels to supply the animal 's need . Amino acids are made up of both D and L forms , which refer to the stereo configurations . Amino acids occurring in nature are in the L form . However , both D and L forms can be synthesized in the laboratory . Animals can change the D to the L form to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the most part , only the naturally occurring L form of the amino acid is utilized by the animal . There are some differences between animals in this regard , however . There is no information available for the horse to indicate to what extent , if any , it can utilize the D form of certain amino acids . This is important to know it synthetic amino acids are to he used to supplement horse diets . If the synthetic // amino acid contains equal amounts of the D and L forms , then it is only one-half as effective as the L form . It takes twice as much of the DL-amino acid as of the Lamino acid to meet the animal 's needs . III . INDISPENSABLE AMINO ACIDS It is not known how many indispensable amino acids the horse requires . It is known , however , that the amino acid lysine can benefit the young horse when added to the diet . University of Florida studies ( 2,3 ) indicated that maximum growth rate occurred when the lysine content of the diet was at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lysine requirement is at least 0.6 0.7% in the total diet for weanlings and 0.4% for yearlings ( 4-6 ) . The younger foal needs a higher lysine level ( 7 ) . A Florida study ( 8 ) showed that 38 ? 40 g of lysine daily is adequate to support maximum growth in yearly thoroughbred and Quarter Horse foals . The 1989 NRC ( 1 ) report states that the lysine requirement varies from 0.28 to 0.61% depending on the stage of the life cycle of the horse ( Table 6.5 ) . The highest requirement is 0.61% for the rapidly growing weanling horse . Therefore , lysine is an indispensable amino acid for the young horse , since it can not synthesize enough to meet its body requirements . How many other amino acids are indispensable for the horse is not known . Table 7.1 gives a guide to the indispensable and the dispensable amino acids required by the pig . It can also be used as a guide for the horse . Animals can synthesize certain amino acids from other amino acids or other nutrients in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires only one indispensable amino acid ; the rest of the 21 amino acids shown in Table 7.1 are dispensable for the horse . It may be , however , that the young foal or young horse under the heavy stress of training or racing may require other indispensable amino acids , since it may not be able to synthesize all it needs under high-stress conditions . An adequate amount of dispensable amino acids in the diet lessens the need for certain indispensable amino acids . For example , cystine is synthesized from methionine . Thus , if the cystine content of the diet is low , there must be enough methionine in the diet to supply not only the body 's need for methionine but also a sufficient quantity to be used for the synthesis of cystine as well . It is more efficient , therefore , to supply the dispensable amino acids in the diet than to create them by synthesis from indispensable amino acids . Of special importance is that body protein synthesis requires that all of the indispensable amino acids involved be present simultaneously . Any indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utilization of all the others . For example , if one indispensable amino acid is present at about iO% of its required level , it will limit the use of all the other indispensable amino // acids to about 80% of their needed level in the diet . Therefore , it is important that diets contain the proper level of all the indispensable amino acids for maximum amino acid utilization and protein production . The mechanism of protein syn thesis in the body is governed by the completeness and balance of the amino acids supplied from the diet and those currently available in the body from amino acid synthesis . Amino acids are not stored in the body as such . An incomplete mixture of amino acids is broken down and used as a source of energy , i.e. , they are not held for any length of time in the tissues waiting for the arrival of the missing amino acid . This means that protein supplements should be mixed with the grain at the proper level so the horse receives a well-balanced concentrate diet each time it eats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemental methionine showed a trend toward increased serum levels of methionine , lysine , histidine , arginine , tryptophan , leucine , isoleucine , and valine . This may indicate that methionine is an indispensable amino acid under certain conditions . A Florida study ( 10 ) reported results indicating that threonine may be the second limiting amino acid for yearling horses receiving grass forage-based feeding programs . Inadequate threonine appears to reduce feed intake and weight gain . A report by M. J. Glade ( 11 ) suggested that specific amino acid supplementa tion during conditioning may enhance aerobic work capacity . His work involved using leucine , isoleucine , valine , glutaminc , and carnitine. // Table 7.2 gives the lysine levels in some of the feeds commonly used for horses . Of the grains , corn and the sorghum have the lowest level of lysine . Of the plant protein supplements , soybean meal has the highest level . Fish meal , dried skim milk , and dried brewer 's yeast are also excellent sources of lysine . IV . QUALITY OF PROTEIN Feeds that supply the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " good-quality " protein whereas those feeds that furnish an inadequate amount of any of the indispensable amino acids are consid-ered " poor-quality " protein sources . This is best illustrated in a Cornell Univer-sity study ( 12 ) where linseed meal and a blend of milk products ( containing dried whey , dried whey fermentation solubles , cheese rind , and dried buttermilk ) were fed to colts that were 5 months old and weighed 420 lb . The milk products contained 25% protein and the linseed meal 35% protein . The linseed meal and milk products supplied about 40% of the total protein in the diet . The results obtained during a 76-day trial are given in the following tdhulation. // The colts fed the milk products consumed 14% more feed , gained 56% more weight , and were 20% more efficient in the conversion of their feed to body weight . Since both protein supplements supplied the same amount of total protein , these results indicate that a lack of some amino acid was involved . In the next experiment the Cornell workers added 0.4% lysine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses fed linseed meal to do as well as those fed the milk products . This indicated that the big difference between linseed meal and the milk products was the fact that linseed meal is low in lysine . The linseed meal diet contained between 0.3 and 0.4% lysine , whereas the milk products diet had between 0.65 and 0.70% lysine . This trial also verified another study ( 13 ) in which it was found that 475 ? lb horses needed 0.60% lysine in the diet . Borton et al . ( 14 ) found that foals weaned early and fed dried skim milk grew faster than those fed soybean meal diets . The diet that has the highest protein quality is the one that supplies all the indispensable amino acids needed in the proportions most nearly like those in which they exist in the body protein of the horse . This kind of a diet will meet the protein needs with a minimum intake of feed protein . Grains are lacking in lysine and , therefore , contain " poor-quality " protein , as does linseed meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , is a " good-quality " protein supplement , since it has a good level and balance of the indispensable amino acids ( see Table 7.2 ) . The majority of the amino acids are absorbed in the small intestine . There is also some absorption ( 15,16 ) of amino acids of microbial origin from the cecum and large intestine ( microbial synthesis ) . It is thought , however , that the amino acids synthesized by the organisms in the cecum and large intestine are not too efficiently utilized by the horse . If this is the case , then protein fed to a young horse needs to be of good quality . It means the young horse will be dependent , to a considerable extent , on the balance and level of the amino acids in the feed and can not depend on the synthesis of amino acids in the cecum to take care of its amino acid needs . V. BALANCE OF INDISPENSABLE AMINO ACIDS A balance of indispensable amino acids in the diet is very important for horses in much the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids need to be // fed at the right level , in the right proportion , and at the right time with the other indispensable amino acids for maximum response . The complexity of the amino acid supplementation problem accounts for the inconsistent results that have been obtained by many workers supplementing diets with amino acids . Sometimes they get beneficial effects and other times they do not . To obtain good results from adding amino acids to diets , one must be careful to avoid imbalances . All the limiting amino acids need to be added for optimum response . If two amino acids are lacking in the diet , the addition of the second limiting amino acid without adding the first limiting amino acid ( the one most lacking ) can cause a depression in the rate of gain and feed intake . When the first limiting amino acid is also added , however , the growth depression is overcome . Once the amino acid supplementation problem is well understood , it will be possible to use lower protein diets as well as have a better balance of amino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in diets as much as possible until more is learned about the amino acid needs of the horse . This should especially be the case with the young , rapidly growing horse that is being developed at an early age for racing or high-level performance . To determine definitely the need for an amino acid , various levels of the amino acid as well as diets of different protein content ? and in some cases other possible limiting amino acids in various combinations and levels must be fed to test all possibilities . In other words , determining the need for amino acids in diets is difficult and complex . Moreover , the requirement for amino acids varies not only with the type of diet used and the relative supply and availability of the amino acids , but also with the dietary supply of other essential substances which can , in case of need , be made from an amino acid . In studying the amino acid needs of the horse one must be aware that if an amino acid is added to the diet and the horse does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet is adequate in that amino acid . The horse might have responded if the correct amino acid level was fed and if the balance and level of other possible limiting amino acids was also met . VI . AMINO ACID ANTAGONISM Clarification of amino acid antagonisms requires further research but one must he aware of it as an area of possible concern . This antagonism might occur when one amino acid affects the requirement for another by interfering with its metabolism . This might occur among amino acids that are structurally related . These interrelationships indicate the complexity of determining the requirement kw indispensable amino acids and whether or not supplementation may be needed . Amino acid requirements will vary a great deal depending on the feeds used . their quality , their method of processing , amino acid and other nutrient interrelationships , and many other factors . // In a Minnesota study ( 18 ) with 92-day-old pony foals fed a low-protein ( 13% ) diet plus 100 ppm niacin and 0.6% added lysine gained significantly faster than foals fed the low-protein diet or the low-protein diet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give for these results where a possible synergism occurred . VII . AMINO ACID INTERRELATIONSHIPS The study of amino acid needs of the horse is in its infancy . It is known that lysine supplementation is helpful in the young horse . There is a possibility that methionine and threonine supplementation might also be needed in certain situations . Some amino acid interrelationships in the pig are presented as a means of clarifying factors affecting amino acid requirements . These interrelationships need to be considered as one studies amino acid needs of the horse , especially with the young foal , even though there is no assurance that the swine data will entirely apply to the horse . A. Tryptophan The pig can use tryptophan and synthesize niacin from it , but it can not convert niacin back to tryptophan . It is estimated that each 50 mg of tryptophan in excess of the tryptophan requirement will yield 1 mg of niacin . It appears that when studying niacin needs , one should use diets that are just adequate in tryptophan . When studying tryptophan needs one should use diets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , niacin . D-Tryptophan has a biological activity of 60 ? 70% that of L-tryptophan for the growing pig . B. Methionine Methionine can be converted to cystine but cystine can not be converted back to methionine . Cystine can satisfy at least 50% of the total need for sulfur amino acids . Methionine can meet the total need for sulfur amino acids ( methionine + cystine ) in the absence of cystine . It appears that methionine supplementation may be beneficial with improperly processed soybean meal but may be of no help with a properly processed meal . Methionine can furnish methyl groups for choline synthesis . Choline is therefore effective in sparing methionine , because , with an adequate level of choline in the diet , methionine is not needed for choline synthesis . In a diet which is mildly deficient in both , adding either one will improve growth . // DL-Methionine can replace the ' , form in meeting the needs for methionine , but the D-form is used less effectively than the L.-form by the very young pig . C. Phenylalanine Phenylalanine can meet the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tyrosine . Tyrosine can not be converted to phenylanine . If the diet contains sufficient tyrosine , phenylalanine will not be used for tyrosine synthesis . Tyrosine can satisfy at least 50% of the total need for the aromatic amino acids tyrosine plus phenylalanine for growth . D. Arginine Swine can synthesize enough arginine for maintenance and pregnancy , but not enough for early growth in the young , in which situation diet arginine is needed . E. Proline Proline is not yet considered to be an indispensable amino acid , but the young pig ( 2.2 ? 11 lb ) appears to be unable to synthesize it rapidly enough for its requirements and so , in this situation , a dietary source is needed . If further studies verify this , proline may then possibly be considered as an indispensable amino acid for the pig . VIII . EXCESS PROTEIN Excess proteins are deaminated ( the nitrogen removed as ammonia and urea ) . The remainder of the protein molecule serves as a source of energy or is stored as fat through complex mechanisms in the body . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess protein should not be fed to supply energy and fat , since it is usually too expensive to do so . Rather , grains and their by-products and other high-energy feeds , which are cheaper sources of energy , should be used . A Colorado study ( 19 ) with endurance-type horses showed that increased sweating and high pulse and respiration rates occurred when excess protein was fed to their horses . A survey of seven trainers at seven thoroughbred race tracks in New Jersey showed that the average time for their horses to finish a race increased by 1 ? 3 seconds for every 1000 g of crude protein ingested in excess of the 1978 NRC-recommended protein requirements ( 20 ) . While this was a very high level of protein intake , it indicates a need for further attention . Another study ( 21 ) found that feeding 130% of the 1978 NRC-recommended amount of protein increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus as compared to // foals fed 70 or 100% of the NRC-recommended protein requirement . A Cornell University study ( 22 ) reported no harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 23 ) found no detrimental effects from feeding an excessive level of protein ( 20% ) in the diet to 2-year-old horses which were fitness-trained on a treadmill for 5 weeks . But , they also found no beneficial effects from the 20% protein diet as compared to a 10% protein diet . A Utah State University study ( 24 ) reported that the higher protein levels used in their trial were of no metabolic hindrance to competitive performance . A Kentucky study with 6-month-old colts fed 10 , 13 , 16 , and 19% protein showed an increased rate of gain with each increase in protein for 112 days ( 25 ) . These studies would indicate no appreciable , if any , harmful effect from feeding a reasonable amount of protein above the NRC requirement levels . But one should be careful and not exceed these levels to any appreciable degree . It is best to err on the side of feeding a small excess of protein rather than run the risk of a lack of protein for the high-level performance horse . This is especially important because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and quality of protein in the hays used . Dr. H. F. Hintz of Cornell University has stated that there is no scientific evidence that the level of protein is related to the incidence of bumps in horses ( 26 ) . IX . ENERGY ? PROTEIN RATIO RELATIONSHIP There is an optimum calorie to amino acid ratio for each stage of growth as well as for the entire life cycle of the horse . If the calorie to amino acid ratio is correct , it maximizes energy utilization in the horse . As the energy content of the diet increases , there is an increased need for amino acids , or protein , in the diet . A lack of protein in the diet , therefore , decreases energy utilization , increases the feed required per pound of gain , and decreases rate of gain or performance level . Practically no information is available on the calorie ( or energy ) to amino acid ( or protein ) ratios for the horse . The poultry industry is the most advanced in making use of more sophisticated energy values , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximizing energy efficiency and utilization . Eventually , horse nutrition will need to reach the same degree of expertise . In the meantime , the level of protein used should be slightly more liberal than the experimentally determined minimum protein requirements . This will ensure provision of an efficient protein to calorie ratio . It will also provide a needed safety margin since there are considerable differences in the quality of protein among the hays and other feeds fed to horses . More attention to calorie ? amino acid ratios will be needed as fat is added to // high-level performance diets as a means of increasing diet energy density . Since more feed is consumed when the diet energy level is low and less when higher energy density diets are fed , the dietary protein levels need to be adjusted upward to the higher energy level . X. EFFECT OF PROCESSING ON AMINO ACIDS The method of processing has considerable effect on the amino acids and quality of protein supplements . An excellent review by Meade ( 27 ) presents the following facts : 1 . Severe overheating of protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids . Lysine appears to be more sensitive than some of the other amino acids to overheating . 2 . Amino acids are highly available from properly processed soybean meal , cottonseed meal , and peanut meal . This is very important since soybean meal and cottonseed meal are widely used in horse diets. 3 . The amino acid content of fish meals was not found to vary greatly , but availability did vary greatly , with serious depression of availability if meals were overheated or scorched in processing and shipping . 4 . Amino acid composition of meat and bone meal varies greatly depending on the starting material . Availability of amino acids is depressed if the meals are overheated in processing . 5 . There is a need for a rapid method for determining the availability of amino acids . Methionine availability is lowered when the soybean meal is underheated . Raw soybean meal contains some factors that are destroyed by heat , such as trypsin inhibitor , which reduces its nutritional value . XI . SYNTHETIC AMINO ACIDS Until recent years , the study and use of synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level because of the limited amino acid supply available , the high price for some amino acids , and the limited research available on amino acids for the horse . It now appears that new technological breakthroughs are occurring in amino acid synthesis via genetic engineering , recombinant DNA techniques , and other means . As these new developments occur , amino acids will be produced more efficiently in sufficient quantities and at prices that will encourage their study and // use in horse diets . When this happens , lower protein and amino acid levels will be required in horse diets because of the optimum amino acid balance provided by proper amino acid supplementation . As a rule of thumb , 3 lb of feed-grade lysine monohydrochloride ( 78.4% Llysine ) can replace 100 lb of 44% soybean meal per ton of diet for the pig ( 28 ) . Costwise , it will be more economical to use when 3 lb of lysine + 97 lb of grain costs less than 100 lb of soybean meal ( 28 ) . These figures can be used as an approximate guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XII . NONPROTEIN NITROGEN ( NPN ) AS PROTEIN SUBSTITUTE Urea is a nonprotein nitrogen compound . It consists of carbon dioxide and ammonia and contains over 46% nitrogen . Thus , 1 lb of urea is equivalent to 2.87 lb of protein . Urea is the end product of protein or nitrogen metabolism in mammals ( including man ) . Microorganisms in the rumen of ruminant animals can ingest urea , which is then used to synthesize protein . When the microorganisms travel from the rumen to the stomach they are digested by enzymes in the digestive tract . Thus , the microorganisms serve as a source of protein and are digested just like other protein sources . Urea is an important protein substitute for feeding beef , dairy , sheep , goats , and other ruminant animals . For many years there has been considerable interest in whether the horse can utilize urea as a source of protein . The horse has a large cecum and many scientists have wondered whether urea conversion into protein by microorganisms in the cecum and the protein digestion and subsequent absorption of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell University scientists ( 29 ) observed equal nitrogen retention ( or utilization ) by mature ponies from urea , soybean meal , and linseed meal when they were added to a low-protein diet . They concluded that the equine can utilize urea to increase nitrogen retention if a low-protein diet is fed . They also stated that the efficiency of utilization of the absorbed nitrogen from urea is considerably less than that of nitrogen from a protein supplement . A 1981 study by L. M. Slade and R. G. Godbee at Colorado State University involved the use of urea versus soybean meal in the diets of growing horses , including weanlings , yearlings , 2-year-olds , and 3-year-olds ( 49 ) . They found that the young weanlings fed soybean meal grew more ( 79 lb ) than those fed the urea ( 24 lb ) . There was no difference in growth rate between the older groups of horses fed either urea or soybean meal . Thus , it appeared that horses are capable of utilizing urea more efficiently as they become older . Part of this may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding , such as occurs with ruminants . It usually takes 2 ? 4 weeks for ruminants to adapt to urea feeding . Part of the explanation could also he that the older horse has a lower protein requirement // than the young horse . The Colorado scientists also stated that it appears that horses are better able to utilize urea for minimal growth or maintenance than for maximum growth ( weight gain ) . A good many studies have been conducted with urea to show that it can be used to support nitrogen balance in mature horses fed low-protein diets ( 29-32 ) . Theoretically , the increased nitrogen retention could be brought about through utilization of microbial protein ( 32,33 ) or endogenous protein synthesis in the liver from ammonia released by microorganisms ( 34 ) . Data obtained in Ohio ( 31 ) strongly suggested that in the horse ammonia absorption occurs from the cecum . Studies in Colorado ( 35 ) showed that either urea or soybean meal are able to provide the ammonia pool needed for microbial protein synthesis . Studies in Cornell ( 36 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the digestive tract of the horse . Studies in Maryland ( 37 ) suggested that the addition of yeast culture to the diet of thoroughbred yearlings acted by stimulating the conversion of recycled urea to microbial protein and amino acids . Another Maryland study ( 38 ) suggested that the decreased fermentability of the hemicellulose fraction of their straw-containing diet was responsible for the decreased microbial utilization of recycled urea and its metabolite , ammonia . This suggested that nitrogen intakes should be supplemented when mature horses are fed poorly fermentable feeds . Studies in California ( 39 ) showed that nitrogen retention was increased at each crude protein level ( 7 , 10 , 13 , and 16% ) by the addition of urea to corn gluten ( an imbalanced protein source ) diet . The response from urea decreased as the protein level in the diet increased . Studies in Washington State ( 33 ) showed that biuret , a compound resulting from the condensation of urea production , was slightly more beneficial than urea when added to a low-protein diet . Biuret is much less toxic than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more expensive . The slow release of ammonia provides safety against ammonia toxicity . The Washington State study ( 33 ) indicates that hiuret can be used safely in horse diets . A field trial ( 40 ) also verified the safety of feeding biuret to horses . In evaluating the use of NPN in horse diets , there is no adequate information to indicate how much of the increased nitrogen retention is due to dispensable amino acids synthesized in the liver of the horse or from the absorption of amino acids synthesized by the microfiora in the digestive tract ( 41,42 ) . Two separate studies have shown that the horse can tolerate a fairly large amount of urea . Horses were fed from 0.5 to 0.55 lb of urea per day and did not develop any adverse effects . Scientists at Louisiana State University ( 43 ) fed horses levels of urea up to 0.5 lb per day for 4 weeks , and the horses exhibited weight gains , glossy hair coats , and good physical condition . In another study ( 44 ) horses were fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months without any harmful effects . Thus , mature horses are not as susceptible to urea toxicity as sonic scientists once thought . Studies in Delaware ( 45 ) showed that mature // ponies weighing 387 lb were fed a diet with 2.5% urea with no adverse effects . The average consumption of the ponies was 67.1 g of urea daily . An Abilene Christian University study ( 46 ) showed that weanling horses may safely be fed concentrate diets with 1% urea . Some investigators feel that young foals might be susceptible to urea toxicity . Therefore , one still needs to proceed with caution with regard to possible urea toxicity in horses . A Cornell study ( 47 ) showed that ponies weighing 286 lb fed 450 g of urea in one feeding died as a result of ammonia toxicity . The urea intake was equivalent to 25% of the diet . One study ( 48 ) suggested that an inverse relationship between dietary crude fiber content and the apparent digestibility of nitrogen similar in magnitude to that for cattle may exist for the horse . A study by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University involved the use of commercial range protein blocks containing urea ( 49 ) . They were fed to brood-mares during the last one-third of their gestation period . The mares consumed 5.5 lb of the protein block plus 17.6 lb of grass hay daily . The Colorado scientists concluded from their studies that the range protein blocks containing urea had no detrimental effects either to the fetus or the mare . This should decrease the concern of horse owners who run cattle and horses together and where the cattle are fed protein blocks containing urea . Presently , urea is still not recommended for use in horse diets . There is still much to learn on whether it might be feasible and economical to use in certain horse diets . The age of the horse needs to be considered . The kind of diet used and the level and quality of the protein it contains may also influence the response obtained from urea feeding . There are still too many unanswered questions concerning urea use by the horse , and until this information is obtained , it is difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The person with young foals or with valuable performance horses should not feed urea in horse diets until more is known about its use and value . The 1989 NRC report ( 1 ) states that there appears to be no beneficial effect of including nonprotein nitrogen ( such as urea ) in practical diets for horses . They also state that urea is well tolerated by the mature horse at levels of up to 4% of the total diet . They indicate that this tolerance is likely due to the high solubility of urea , which results in its absorption from the small intestine and subsequent excretion by the kidney . Two studies indicate that growing horses can not achieve maximum growth rates ( 49 ) , and lactating mares do not give maximum milk production ( 50 ) when a major portion of the nitrogen requirement is provided by urea . XIII . PROTEIN REQUIREMENT INFORMATION The protein requirement depends on the amino acid content of ' the feeds used . If the total diet is balanced and is a high-quality protein diet , the protein level // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a low-quality protein diet . When protein of marginal quality is fed , the diet protein must be increased to provide the indispensable amino acids ( 51 ) . Lysine is a limiting amino acid with linseed meal and with all the grains used in horse diets ( see Table 7.2 ) . Therefore , lysine supplementation may be needed for the young , growing horse unless other lysine-rich feeds are used . Weanling horses require 0.6 ? 0.7% lysine and yearlings require 0.4% lysine in the diet ( 4,5 ) . A. Effect of a Protein Deficiency A protein deficiency results in a depressed appetite , which leads to inadequate consumption of total feed . A poor hair coat and reduced hoof growth may also occur . A protein deficiency and a lack of energy often occur together . This results in a loss in weight in mature horses . In young horses , slow , inefficient growth and underdevelopment occurs ( 52,53 ) . Other possible effects of a protein deficiency include reduced conception rate ( 54 ) . Pregnant mares deficient in protein may have small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of protein ( 55 ) . B. Research on Protein for Horses The amino acid requirements for maintenance of the horse are not known ( 51 ) . The body composition of the horse varies with age . Although the fat-free body of the horse tends to maintain a water content of 72% , a protein content of 22% , and an ash content of 6% ( 56,57 ) , the whole body may vary from 2% fat at birth to 20% for a mature horse in good condition ( 58 ? 60 ) . There is little or no increase in diet protein required above maintenance for work ( 51,61 ) . A 1985 study ( 62 ) showed that exercise alone did not increase the protein requirement in growing horses . Another study ( 63 ) suggested that diets of exercising horses need not have protein at concentrations higher than that required for maintenance . A small amount of nitrogenous compounds , including protein , is lost in sweat ( 64 ) . The energy requirements for work are met by extra feed intake . This results in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen lost in the sweat ( 51,65 ) . Beeley et al . ( 66 ) recently isolated a protein called latherin in horse sweat . They suggested that latherin may have a role in thermoregulation of the exercising horse . Sweat losses increase as activity levels increase , and losses as high as 5% of body weight have been estimated ( 67 ) . Sweat may contain 1 ? 1.5% nitrogen ( 67 ) . Nitrogen balances tend to be more positive in conditioned horses as compared to idle horses fed similar levels of nitrogen ( 68,69 ) . I ) wring the last 90 days of gestation the protein requirement increases consideia hly . The products of conception ( fetus ) contain 11.3% protein and total 10 ?
