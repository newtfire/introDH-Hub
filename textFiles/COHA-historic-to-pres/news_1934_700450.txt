With shipments currently running close to 2,500 units a day , Chrysler Corp . ' s unit outturn during February should approach the corporation 's output for the entire first quarter of 1933 when 57,861 cars and trucks were shipped to dealers and distributors . As activity is now on the uptrend , it is possible that actual shipments might slightly exceed this figure . In common with all the producers who were affected by the tool and die makers ' strike during the fall and by the production delays caused by extensive model changes , Chrysler 's output in January was considerably below the levels justified by orders for its products . Plymouth produced 17,545 cars in January . most of which were manufactured in the latter half of the month . Nevertheless . Plymouth 's output was about double its production during January of last year , Airflow Models Delayed Production figures for the corporation 's other linen were not released , but it is likely that aggregate shipments were several thousand units in excess of the total for the month last year , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chrysler and DeSoto Airflow models did not get under way until the end of the month . In keeping with the present strong retail demand for cars and with the usual seasonal trend of business , the expectation now is for a further expansion in production schedules during March . If the best potentialities are realized . it is possible that total shipments for the first quarter might run close to 160,000 cars and trucks . Minimum expectations , based on current conditions , would be for about 140,000 units . Cost of Extensive Changes These projected limits to the quarter 's business compare with actual shipments of 159,753 units in the second quarter of last year and 169,652 units in the third quarter , when net profits totaled $1.80 and $1.67 a share , respectively . However , estimates on the current quarter 's earnings , based only on comparison of prospective unit volume with 1933 periods , are hazardous . Uncertain , factors from a profit standpoint include ' the extent to which higher prices on 1934 products have compensated for increased costs , the allocation of tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 due to the extensive changes incorporated in the 1934 cars , and possible additions to reserves for contingencies . The substantial recovery in Chrysler 's earning power last year was concentrated in the second and third quarters . In the first quarter , with business at a low ebb , a net loss of $3,038 , - 081 was incurred , after charging earnings with $1,518,809 to increase reserves for contingencies . Reserves Drawn Down During the fourth quarter , with production virtually at a standstill during the latter half of the period because of model changes and the tie-up resulting from the tool and die strike , an indicated net profit of $191,437 was shown in the corporation 's annual report . However , during the quarter , reserves for contingencies were drawn on to the extent of $5,165,188 , offsetting the increase in these reserves during the first nine months of the year and reducing the account to $4.418,763 , compared with 54.543.418 on December 31 , 1932 . Part of the charge against reserves during the quarter was employed to reduce deposits in closed banks to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits were carried at $4,985,730 . The exact amount of the charge-off or of possible recoveries from some of these deposits in the last quarter was not disclosed in the annual report . A substantial increase in the permanent asset account occurred during the fourth quarter . presumably reflecting in large part increased expenditures for dies and equipment in connection with 1934 models . On December 31 , net permanent assets were valued at $60,409,225. an increase of $7,281,352 since September 30 . NVorlcing Capital ilp In rear These expenditures , combined with dividend payments of about $2,150,000. purchase of $879 , - 000 face amount of Dodge Brothers debentures . and acquisition of additional amounts of the corporation 's own shares brought a decline of $11,312,900 in net current assets during the fourth quarter . The total of $53,417,113 in working capital held on December 31 was , however , $4,130,696 larger than at the end of 1932 . Once the industry as a whole has adequately stocked its dealers with 1934 cars , competitive sales figures will be watched closely to determine whether Chrysler will be able this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preceding three years . The corporation 's product program for 1934 shows that it is continuing the policies responsible for the past expansion . On the other hand , competitive effort throughout the industry is keener this year . In 1933 , Chrysler increased its share of the domestic passenger car market to 25.8% from 17.4% in 1932 and about 9% in 1929 . Reflecting the benefits of the successful invasion of the low priced field responsible for this showing . Chrysler 's unit sales last year were slightly larger than in 1929 , while sales by the industry as a whole were 64% under 1929.
