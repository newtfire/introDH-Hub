THE word " Society , " the single word , unaccompanied by an article or qualified by an adjective , not a society of some sort of crank or the society of an intimate friend , or good , bad , or polite society , but simply society with a capital S , and meaning roughly the world of fashion , has be ? come almost exclusively an American term . One seldom hears it in England . In England , people occasionally men ? tion an undefined yet absolutely definite thing called good society which people do or do not belong to , and they speak of this or that set , and call someone " an awful outsider " or " a frightful bounder , " but the life of the great world is not re ? ferred to as " society , " partly because it is not centered in a town where street lamps and the lighted doors of restau ? rants give the man or woman in the street the chance to gape and gossip , but goes on mostly in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hedges , glades of oak , beech or ash , paddocks and stables , and a drifting mist of rain . Everything that really matters in Eng ? land is shrouded and misty and pursues its course without noise or fuss . Not Lon ? don , but the big country house , or the pack of foxhounds , or the race meeting is the social center of England . There are hundreds of centers , not one ; and the good society of England is based on county society . But again the phrase is not used . The word county is enough . The word society does n't figure . It is almost as if there was something slightly vulgar about it . Those who are in it take it for granted ; those who are not , do n't talk about getting into it , For thesocial system of England is more like a mountain than a ladder , and to be taken up by a smart set in London is quite a different thing from being accepted by England as a gentleman . The world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one takes London 's social life seriously . Socially , one may say , London has no society of its own . it is too big , too hu ? man , too good-humored and slovenly and generous . But people use it , the grand people , as a meeting ground . They come up to town for six weeks or a month , or a couple of nights , to attend com ? mittee meetings and board meetings or debates in Parliament , to go to a play , or attend a function or give one , to bring a girl out and take her to Buckingham Palace , and have the children 's teeth seen to , and so on . Perhaps they have a house in town , perhaps not . The house in town , in any ease , is merely a con ? venience . One of its chief attractions is that it is easy to get away from , to Ascot or Epsom , to Ranelagh or Hurlinghani , or home again from Saturday to Mon ? day . However that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublimely inconsistent English County pours into London , leaves its gardens in full glorious bloom , puts geraniums in the window boxes of Mayfair , and lends its presence to the town , filling Bond Street with flowered chiffon frocks , parasols , and garden hats ; and big grimy indifferent London partakes for a moment of the glamour of the country and is touched with magic . The Quality in frivolous mood gives London every year an ele ? gant appearance . It takes , roughly , fifty years , or three generations , for a family of intelligent and determined outsiders to climb up the English mountainside as far as that high plateau where leisured folk securely rooted in rustic class-prejudice stand aloof above the smoky valley of the in ? dustrial world . It is a slow process in England , this climbing , yet not so slow as some would like to believe . There are people scattered all over lovely England who would turn pale with horror at the idea that a county family or a gentleman 's house could be built in three generations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious about it , it can be done . Indeed , one can watch the process . It is going on all the time . One can observe the three generations living out their lives simultaneously on the three levels , sometimes all under the same roof . It is n't a case of buying family portraits or a Rolls and clothes from Paris . Clothes have nothing to do with it . It is all much more drastic . It is acase of uprooting and transplanting , geographically , of moving in fact into the country . The workman 's cottage gives way to the big house on the out ? skirts of the town . It is here that the old people stick , with a view of the fam ? ily 's factory chimneys from the windows . They are rather lost , the old people , in the big house . They are shy in the pres ? ence of the butler and the footman and very lonely . They have no friends , and secretly long for the old days , when they had high tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , the old lady trots timidly round the rooms up ? stairs after the competent housemaids with a duster in her hand . Not so the young married couple . The son divides his time between the factory and the hunting field . He plays bridge and dines out in a dinner jacket and goes to hunt balls . He has married a sporting girl from some other part of the country and is determined , once the old people are gone , to move away from the sight of those chimneys . Perhaps he does n't wait . It is important to get away fromstreets and trains before one 's children are out of the nursery . He gets himself a hunting box or a farm in a good hunt ? ing district . The boys are put down for Eton or Harrow the week they are born ; and by the time the children take notice the scene has changed , the third genera ? tion is surrounded by horses and dogs , a home farm and a garden , women in tweeds or riding clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk in the autumn is all of partridges , pheasants , and grouse , in winter of foxes and hounds , in spring of cricket and salmon . And , lo ! an English gentleman is in the making . It all goes on in the country , the real thing , the real process of transmu ? tation . The ranks of the gentry are filled up slowly by people who have had the patience to mold themselves to type , to the required rustic type , the type of the country squire . London has noth ? ing to do with it . Self-made Englishmen with ambitious wives do n't descend upon London from Manchester , Birmingham , Liverpool , or Leeds to get into society . They do n't think about society and never hear the word . They merely know that they want something from life for their chil ? dren which they did 11 ot have themselves ; and so they move into the country , buy horses and dogs , cows and pigs , take to farming and gardening , and presently their children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain in England is through the ani ? mal and vegetable kingdom . A house in town , a season in London , being put up for this or that club , going to smart parties , presenting the girls , putting the boys into the Army , all that automati ? cally follows , It is the horses and cows and pheasants and partridges that lead the way . But America , someone objects , is a young country and a democratic country and takes no interest in all these old English customs . America does n't be lieve in leisure . It believes in work . The hundred-per-cent American has no use for Society . He has other things to do than go to lunch parties , dinner parties , and tea-fights . He has his busi ? ness , and at night he is tired . All the so ? ciety he wants is the society of his fam ? ily . His idea of social life is the family circle . He gets all the excitement he wants in the office ; when he leaves it he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in his shirt sleeves if he feels like it . Unfortunately his wife does not agree with him . She has social ambitions and plenty of time to indulge in dreams of their realization . The poor man is forced into a tail coat and dragged out to dinner parties , theater parties , and dances . He goes meekly enough , for he is a submissive male and too tired to fight , but inwardly he swears and rebels . Secretly he despises Society and Society women . If his wife is one he secretly despises her too . He hates all that English class rot . He loathes loafers and fears leisure . A man who does n't work is a waster . He has no use for him . The privileges and re ? sponsibilities of birth , breeding , or cul ? ture ? Nonsense . All men are equal or should be in the eyes of the Lady who stands at the entrance to New York Har ? bor . " Liberte , Egalite% Fraternig . " He has a vague impression that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy . It was a revolt against privilege and snob ? bery , a protest against the right of a class to cultivate idleness and an elaborate technic of pleasure . Our hundred-per ? cent American believes in simple pleas ? ures . In spite of his contempt for so ? ciety he is a gregarious sociable creature who does n't like to be alone , and he has the habit of crowds , of noise , of hustle and bustle more than anyone ; hut his pleasures are the pleasures of children . He likes games and he likes toys . A motor car and a gramophone and a pal who plays golf are the only companions he needs outside his family . He is , moreover , the descendant of men withmoral convictions somewhat similar to those of the revolutionaries in France , and who sailed to America , carrying an outfit of stern ideals with them in the Mayflower . These ideals of our Pilgrim Fathers are still powerful and they have made the normal development of polite society difficult . For worldliness is still considered rather wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the United States who are most fitted by tradition and instinct to lend grace , dig ? nity , and elegance to American Society will have little or nothing to do with it . They do n't , as the saying is , go out . Well , the world is the poorer and they perhaps are too . Who can tell ? In any case without them social life can never be what it should be . For it should be an art and , if it is to be taken seriously at all , should be judged as architecture , music , or painting are judged . The social life of a nation , or the art of human inter ? course as it is practiced in any given country , is the index of its civilization . Our hundred-per-cent American would not admit this . Most likely he despises art too . Painting , music , poetry , these belong to the woman 's world . He knows nothing about them . He has no time to listen to music or look at pictures . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer in the Life Guards , did beautiful needlework , he would immediately jump to the conclusion that the man was an idiot or a milksop and that the British Army would be routed the next time it went into battle . It has not yet oc ? curred to him that variety is the spice of life , and that it is worth while to adorn life with as many beauties , interests , and graces as possible . But climbing and the social climber have always been words of opprobrium . I wonder why ? Except in the nostrils of saints or hermits , why should they have such a nasty odor ? Why not admit that snobbery is one of the very greatest forces for refinement in the world ? Surely , it is an excellent thing that men and women should learn to discriminate be ? tween good food and food , for instance , or between a loud noise and wit . Surely , unless one is going to withdraw from the world altogether , it is desirable that the men and women in it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make themselves agreeable . Com ? pare for a moment the chattering of the monkeys in the zoo with the repartee of a French dinner party . There you have the measure of the dynamic energy contained in the force of snobbery . Snobbery or , in other words , the striving to imitate one 's betters , is the humble housemaid in the house of evolution . The French , who are the great artists in life , have always looked upon social intercourse as one of the fine arts . The manners and modes of the beau monde have always seemed to Frenchmen of in ? telligence worthy of critical attention . The French are stylists . They adore elegance of form ; and the style of a social group , perhaps because it is an ephem ? eral thing and can leave behind it no monument in stone nor portrait on can ? vas , has for them a special precious inter ? est . The Eighteenth Century in France marked for the Western world the cul ? mination of a social technic that was a creative achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took some hun ? dred years to develop , and it imposed it ? self as something of absolute value in a world where men were in the habit of massacring one another by thousands for a religious idea or a moral prejudice . This question of taste is the crux of the whole matter . The function of Society is to make the life of a community agree ? able and to add to it grace , beauty , and dignity . The fact is that life in the raw is a dreary business for most people , or an exciting nerve-racking business , an exhausting struggle full of disappoint ? ments , failures , hard knocks , and heart ? breaks ; and men demand relief from this and sympathy , and they want pleas ? ure . They go to one another for these things because they can not supply them to themselves . They huddle together and band together in the search for pleas ? ure , and this huddling is Society in em-bryo . Society is simply a community of pleasure-seekers . Its quality and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choice of pleasures . Eighteenth-century France produced the " salon " and the art of conversation and chose wit as its special form of amuse ? ment . England evolved the elaborate comfort of the great country house and its lavish decorous hospitality . Amer ? ica ? well , America is still choosing . It imitates the French sometimes and sometimes the English . It has built palaces on Palm Beach and has organ ? ized many magic cities where stunts and thrills abound . It depends for its en ? joyment very largely upon jazz and cock ? tails and games of contest . The more subtle pleasures of social life are as yet , for the most part , unknown in America ; for they grow on very old vines like bunches of purple grapes that ripen very slowly ; and he who would taste their delicate flavor must go gently , else the fragile glass house will come down on his head with a crash , vanish like a dream , and he will find himself stranded in a resort very like Coney Island . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is very little good society ; for taste and a sense of the proper use of leisure are not acquired in a day . Merry-go-rounds and joy barrels , jazz bands and football have nothing to do with the social life of civilized people . They are merely a sign of its non-existence . Children do not know what social intercourse means . Charming little savages , each isolated in his own bounding and eager ego , they meet to engage in make-believe death-struggles , just as all barbarians do . So ? cial life is the antithesis of the football scrimmage . Yet in America many peo ? ple have not yet learned the difference between the two . The American as a social being is still a child . Good society is like a pudding . It re ? quires certain ingredients . Its founda tion must first of all consist of well-bred people . They are the eggs and they must be real . You can not fake eggs . No one that I 've heard of has invented a substitute . There are no patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-bred people I mean gentlefolk , people who by instinct and tradition are gentle with one another and who know that the golden rule ? " Do unto others as you would be done by " ? is a very good guide to agreeable intercourse with one 's neighbors . If the majority in any so ? cial group is not gentle , then society breaks down , and you have the football scrimmage and the joy barrel . The second ingredient in the social pudding is intelligence , the third is leisure , and the fourth , alas , is money . Some of the group must have money . Not very much , not too much . If there is too much money about the tendency is to pay professional entertainers and cease to exert yourself ; but there must be enough to insure that margin of freedom from toil and worry which is necessary for the elaboration of a technic of enjoy ? ment . These things are absolutely nec ? essary if the pudding is not to go at and soggy . Gentleness produces tact and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people than in yourself . Gentlefolk may be hypocrites and villains . They may be complete egotists , but they do n't show it ; and in society it is what appears that is impor ? tant . Morals are of no importance in society so long as they do n't protrude . This is a cynical saying perhaps , but it is true . The young woman who is out to reform the world is not a social crea ? ture . The people who feel bound to make a display of intolerance have no place in good society . They are bores . They may he infinitely more worth while to the State and the body politic ; that has nothing to do with it . They are out of place in the drawing-room ; and society wo n't tolerate them , not polite society , unless they can drop off their militant bonnets and warlike weap ? ons when they go out to enjoy them ? selves . As for intelligence , without intel ? ligence there can be no conversation , and without conversation society again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great extent everywhere . Why talk when one can dance ? The jazz bands do the talking . Why be witty when one can go to a play ? Why , in fact , think or use one 's wits at all , when there is so much cheerful noise going on and the champagne is flowing ? Too much alcohol will of course ruin any social pudding . Those who are under its influence arc no doubt per ? suaded that they are conversing . I have sat at dinner tables in America where the men on either side of me , knowing dimly that they wished to say something about the weather or the latest play , went on repeating it again and again till the end of the meal and then were not certain that they had said it . I have also been to an enter ? tainment given in a home for the men ? tally deficient . The patients sat together watching a comic film , laughing and snig ? gering . No one was aware of anyone else , though they all talked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking to himself , blowing vague sounds from his throat into the great vague shapeless world . A group of tipsy folk are in an exactly similar case . If any of the convives are sober and sane they must necessarily suffer the extremity of boredom . There are other less important ingre ? dients than those I have mentioned , that give the pudding an extra fine flavor . Indeed , the more spices there are , the richer it will be . Beauty of women is one ; though the French can do without this . They prefer above all else that their pudding should be flavored with a caustic and elegant wit . Erudition as something apart from intelligence is good too , but in small doses , lest it give heaviness to the dish . Nothing must be overdone . All the elements must be carefully proportioned and lightly mixed . The result should be as succulent and complicated as a plum pudding or mince pie and as light as a souffl ? . Inciden ? tally , the male and female ingredients must balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a society worth the name made up all of women or all of men . A society composed entirely of women becomes in the end hysterical and silly . Men , left in a bunch and told to enjoy themselves , play games for a bit , talk shop for a bit , then go to sleep like so many hibernating bears . One of the great drawbacks to social life in America is that society is almost entirely a woman 's affair . The truth is that , if good society is Eke a good pudding , American society is more like a popover . It looks like a souffl ? . It is a lovely golden color but it is empty inside . There is no body to it and no substance . It contains nothing but air and , since the air of America is very electric , it is likely to explode in your face as you bite . Seriously , who has not noticed it , there is a certain feel ? ing of danger in the air at parties in America ? I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking at similar entertainments in Lon ? don or Paris . As one enters the great blazing portals of a ballroom one is aware of a peculiar excitement , a menacing vi ? bration in the atmosphere . One is not quite certain what is going to happen . Something strange and unexpected , some wild burst of jubilant energy or some exhibition of primitive passion , seems to promise a thrilling diversion , perhaps even a tragic disruption of the elaborate scheme . The party seems not quite real . It appears to be stretched in midair like a net in a circus , over a rushing torrent of reality that is tremen ? dous and magnificent in itself , but as menacing to the tranquillity of polite society as the Mississippi River in flood . As one looks about at the faces , listens to the voices , watches the movements of the beautiful girls and lithe young men , one becomes less and less convinced thatthese people have met together for the sake of the rare pleasure of social inter ? course . What they seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adventure perhaps , or per ? haps oblivion . There are , at any rate , always two strong elements at an Amer ? ican ball : those who seek adventure and those who seek oblivion at the bar or in the supper room ; and of course the cock ? tail party ? that most famous concoc ? tion of American society ? is a truly dan ? gerously clever mixture of the two . It is all very exciting of course and very strange . One is asked out to din ? ner and gets nothing to eat . I have come home from dinner dances in Amer ? ica faint with hunger because food was put at my place at table while I danced and taken away when I sat down . And I have been to lunch parties of women where the table groaned with good things and no one but myself was indelicate enough to partake of them . The joys of the palate are evidently unknown and completely neglected . I have also been to dinner parties given in clubs where wine could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not remain at the table two minutes on end , and I spent most of my evening between two empty chairs . And all this takes place in the most elaborate setting . Everything looks quite too lovely . The women are beautiful as exotic birds , their frocks are even more so . The table decorations would make Kew Gardens pale with envy . The silver , the damask , the carpets , the tables and chairs , everything is super ? lative . It is all golden and glowing . Infinite pains have been taken , thou ? sands of dollars have been spent upon food that no one eats , flowers that no one sniffs , frocks that no one can see , at least that the men do n't see . Ah , the men : They are bored . Their atten ? tion is elsewhere . If not too exhausted , or too filled with the fumes of alcohol , they are dreaming of oil wells , of machin ? ery , of fields of grain , and prairies dotted with cattle . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mexico . They are simply not there . If the poor things had a chance ? if the women would only listen to tales of Wall Street or a description of the latest thing in steel girders . . . . But the women wo n't listen . Talk of busi ? ness bores them so they do the talk ? ing ; they chatter on while the men be ? side them escape behind the semblance of an admiring if somewhat sleepy grin . The ingredients of the social pudding in America are not right and they are badly mixed . There is too much of one thing and not enough of another , and some essentials are almost completely lacking , while other extraneous astrin ? gent substances that have no right to be there are very evident . There is too much money and too much femininity . The amount of money lavished on en ? tertaining is bad because it creates an illusion of brilliance where there is none and makes people socially lazy . The preponderance of the female element , as we 've said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , there are not enough gentlefolk and , in fact , not enough Americans . There are too many savages and too many half-breeds and too many questionable for ? eign adventurers . This makes , partic ? ularly in New York , for confusion and chaos in matters of taste and it drives the well-bred people out . They know what they want of Society and , not getting it , they keep away . Finally , there is very little intelligence displayed and almost no wit . The masculine intelligence of America can not be bothered with social things , and the feminine intelligence , forced in upon itself , becomes an elab ? orate narcissism which is inimical to the very basis of social intercourse . If every woman at a party has gone there in order to force admiration from an envious world of other women , or from a reluctant and exhausted world of men the chances are that she will go home feeling " peevish . " The whole thing has on the other hand a barbaric splendor . There is a wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is this that saves it . These wild children have something , they have youth . They are ardent and fiery and electric . They have brains too , some of them , and an inordinate capacity for enjoyment . All the raw materials of social life are theirs , when they choose to use them . At present they do n't . At present this great big show called Society in America is a farce , in spite of the emphasis laid upon it , because no one really cares about the pleasures of social life , they only care about fun , adventure , love , money , work , and the biggest country on God 's earth that has the future in its grip . The American voice comes to my ears as I write . " There 's plenty of time . Wait a bit . In another couple of hun ? dred years when we 're middle-aged and settled down , we 'll go in for those hot ? house grapes of yours . Just now we 're in too much of a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't make any mistake . If it explodes , well , we like excitement . Fried chicken with waffles and maple syrup is a lot better than any of your French messes . As for parties , gee whiz ! what do you know about that ? Do you think anyone can teach us how to throw a party or mix a cocktail ? And do n't be too down on Coney Island either . Our Coney Island 's a great place . What I mean is that Coney Island 's good enough for us and will be , till we 're a lot more tired than we are now . " There is an American story in verse called " The Wild Party " which is creating something of a sensation in London . It is a vivid , ice-cold descrip ? tion , inspired by hatred , of the boozing animal idiocy of a certain savage New York set . The same set was described in a weaker and more frivolous temper by Anita Loos . Mr. Carl Van Vechten would perhaps be surprised did anyone tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in a slightly different dress . Mr. Van Vechten 's sophisticated social figures are the savages of the Wild Party imitating what they think is the civilization of Europe and cramming themselves with culture as dyspeptic youths cram down undigested facts for exams . Mrs. Wharton gives us some ? thing different . Her Age of Innocence is a portrait of the polite world of New York as it used to be , and it has some ? thing of the same charm that breathes in Henry James 's Washington Square . But no one writes like that of New York nowadays . How can they ? If they did , few would read their stories . The gentle ghost of Washington Square is not interesting to the American public . The skyscrapers have obliterated the old landscape , and the roar of the city drowns the sound of these mild voices and tinkling tea cups . The lazy charm of the laden tea table , the deep chairs by the drowsy fireside , and the half-dozen men , some hoary-headed and distinguished by achieve ? ments in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis of the absurdities of life , to the charming woman whom they have known for twenty years ? this sort of thing is , I fancy , unknown in New York . It is English ? the stodgy , comfortable , enduring English version of the French salon . New York has no time for it and is antagonistic to what it stands for , since New York , the great machine , is inhuman , and this is the quintessence of human intercourse . The truth is that New York is the enemy of social life just as machines are the enemies of human beings , but it will come all the same . Americans will escape from the machines and build themselves human habitations out of reach of skyscrapers , subways , elevateds , and bars . They will build in the country just as the English have done . They arc doing it now . The aristocrats of America are already consciously or unconsciously adopting the English Idea . Imitation ? Yes , why not ? Call it rather adaptation , by the knowing , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best is the best and endures because it is the best . The Wild Party is having its day and will drop out of sight . There will always be wild parties just as there always have been in any Nero 's Rome or An ? cient Babylon , but they will he ignored in time by artists in life , or noted merely as the freakish expression of men 's capacity for beastliness . It is not , after all , the drunken orgy that makes an epoch or stamps a civilization . Leisure will come to American life and the knowledge of how to enjoy it . Frenzied youth will be put in its place by wise old age and middle age . The mellow qualities of old port will win out against the kick of the cocktail , and the life of the country house will become the center of social life . It wo n't be , of course , so very like England . The climate and the soil and the geography of the United States will mold it . It will he wider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more excitement . The summers will be hotter , and winters will bring sharper frosts . Distances wo n't count . Airplanes will whirl men for hundreds of miles back and forth from offices in American towns to their homes in Car ? olina or the Catskills , to ranches in Colorado or on plantations in Ken ? tucky and Tennessee . The point is that the mountains and the prairies , the forests and the rivers will impose them ? selves upon the life of men . And the talk will be of shooting and foxhunting , of racing and fishing , of cattle breeding and horse breeding . And the animal and vegetable kingdoms will reign just as in England because horses and dogs and prize cattle and pigs will be the real luxuries of life , not machines . Ma ? chines will be cheap and will lose their fascination . Even New York will be ignored by indifferent men of leisure . They will use it just as the great fam ? ilies of England use London . It may even be that , in time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human .
