" Sometimes I ' m called Lady Cotton , " he said with a chuckle , " or Lord Cotton , or Mr. Ambassador , or just plain ' you . ' The nice thing about being a diplomat is that you are called rude names very much less than when you are a politican. " // The business of being knighted is all very simple , Sir Robert added : " The Government recommends to the Queen that she confer a title ; in her wisdom , she agrees ; then you receive a communication asking if you would accept such a title and you say , ' Yes , for sure , ' and in due course you get it. " // But no matter how he is addressed , Ambassador Cotton says he has felt " very welcome " and at home here . He has discovered , he said , that Americans and Australians are very much alike , and not just because they speak the same language , albeit with vastly different accents . <> <> Attitudes and Instincts // // He finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Americans , in their openness to people and ideas , in their attitudes and instincts , in their forms of government . What is more , he senses that there has been a recent strengthening of ties , that although there are some Government-to-Government differences , for the most part the United States and Australia are being drawn ever closer together by trade , tourism , sport and cultural exchanges. // Ambassador Cotton says that as a result of the many Australian films , television dramas and popular novels that have recently made their way to the United States - not to speak of the Australian yachtsmen making off with the America ' s Cup last year or of Rupert Murdoch , the Australian newspaper czar , buying up American newspapers right and left - Americans no longer think of the country " down under " as strictly the land of kangaroos , cuddly koala bears , swagmen and billabongs . Americans have even taken to drinking Australian beer in significant amounts. // But the Ambassador finds that Americans continue to have one misconception about his country . " Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the way we used to be , ' " he said . " We get all kinds of inquiries from people who want to go to Australia and take up a big cattle ranch. " // In fact , more than 100 , 000 Americans , informed or otherwise , visited Australia last year , and Australia lists the United States as its second most important trade partner , after Japan . <> <> A Big , Open Land // // Musing on why Australia and the United States have so many things in common , Ambassador Cotton pointed out that Australia , like the United States , is a big , open land that was settled by people who came a long way to begin a new country . " Mostly they came from deprived backgrounds , or they were persecuted and they came to make a better life for themselves and families , " he said . " Both countries have opened their borders to people from all over the world . We in Australia have a great ethnic mixture , as do you. " // He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of six colonies , became a nation state , it drew upon the United States Constitution for some of its governmental form . " For instance , " he said , " our Senate is elected in almost the same manner as yours and has the same kind of authority. " // A relaxed , jovial man , Ambassador Cotton is not a diplomat by trade and he irreverently says of his job : " I ' m the chief import for politics here. " // There is little he has not tried in his 69 years . A rancher , farmer , industrialist and businessman , he was an early member of the Liberal Party and was first apppointed , and then was elected , to the Australian Senate in 1965 , a position he held for more than 10 years . He has also served as Australia ' s consul general in New York City and has been appointed to any number of boards , commissions and Cabinet ministerial posts . <> <> ' They Still Pay Me ' // // Although the Labor Party came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Australia ' s envoy to Washington . " I didn ' t leave and they didn ' t ask me to - and they still pay me , " he said with a laugh as he chatted in his spacious office in the Australian Embassy on Scott Circle , a half-dozen blocks from the White House. // " I have a phrase for Washington , " he said , looking out windows that give him a view down 16th Street . " The Imperial City . I call it one of the world ' s Imperial Cities . For someone working in government you are dealing in one of the centers of world power , importance and influence . And it is a noble city with classical buildings and great vistas and avenues. " // One measure of the current Australian view of the United States is the size of its diplomatic contingent in this country . It has 1 , 150 officials posted in various cities and military installations , one-third of that number in Washington , where Australia maintains its largest overseas government presence. // A measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plans being made for the 1988 Australian Bicentennial celebration . Charles W. Parry , chairman and chief executive officer of Alcoa , is head of a group of Americans who are working with Australians in planning for that celebration . Alcoa is one of 850 American companies that do business in Australia , almost twice the number of Australian companies active in this country . <> <> ' We Must Work at It ' // // There always has been and will continue to be an Australian-United States nexus , Ambassador Cotton said . " But we must continue to work at it , " he added , " not only on a nation- to-nation basis but on a people-to-people basis. " // One issue on which the United States and Australia part company is recognition of Vietnam , where the two countries fought as allies in the 1960 ' s and early 1970 ' s . " What we are trying to do is to act as honest brokers to see that Vietnam is not just wedded to Russia but becomes more a part of the region and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live out there and we want peace and progress out there. " // The United States and Australia , along with New Zealand , are treaty partners and allies under the Anzus agreement . But last week there was an international flurry of sorts when some Australians took umbrage that the Republican Party platform included no mention of Anzus in its foreign policy plank. // Ambassador Cotton dismissed it as " a non-event . " " They just cut and shortened the platform some and they also cut a reference to NATO , " he said . " We have no doubts about the strength of the alliance. " // //
