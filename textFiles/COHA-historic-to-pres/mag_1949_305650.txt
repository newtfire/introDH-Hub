The sleepy village of Manchester , Vt. ( pop . 325 ) sat up and took notice last week . White-haired ladies from porch rockers of the Equinox House , straw-hatted farmers , Green Mountain tourists and artists by the station-wagonload jammed into the red brick gymnasium where the Southern Vermont Artists ' Association was staging its 20th annual show . <P> As usual , the crowd stamped first into the " 25 Dollar Room " to grab up the bargains-small pictures signed by such big-name summer residents as Reginald Marsh , Clay Bartlett and John Koch . Summertime Vermonter Paul Sample had forsaken landscapes to paint a dingy backstage ballet scene ; John Taylor Arms sent a sheaf of his architectural etchings . But such relatively individualistic efforts were exceptions to the show as a whole . <P> Far more typical of the 220 artists represented were two local landscapists whose work changes not a whit from year to year : Dean Fausett ( TIME , Aug. 22 ) and Luigi Lucioni . Their crisp , slick pictures of red barns , cows , birches and green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making an exhibition steeped in milk and spinach , the way the customers liked it . ( The exhibiting artists sold $10,000 worth of pictures at last year 's show , might do as well this time . ) <P> Painter Fausett once took a fling at modern art , still likes some of it . " But , " says he , " it does n't belong inside a frame . It 's decorative and that 's all . Braque , for instance , is at his best in tapestries . " Lucioni , who paints barns in a studio barn of his own , is too much awed by nature to tamper with it in his pictures : " When I 'm out in the woods I have the feeling that I 'm in an immense cathedral . " <P> " I feel puny , " he adds , measuring off a half-inch between his thick thumb and forefinger , " very puny . " <P> Such modest conservatives , entrenched in their green hills , might hold off the moderns indefinitely . They hope to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art as the Berkshires ' Tanglewood festival is in music . Plans are under way for a huge , round exhibition hall and theater patterned on 18th Century Vermont 's barns , to make next year 's exhibition bucolic inside &; out . Artist Fausett , who helped hang last week 's show , was particularly pleased with the idea . In a round barn , he mused , no one could complain of being hung in a corner .
