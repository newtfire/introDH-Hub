How to save Yeltsin 's reforms . <p> The greatest foreign policy blunder of the Bush administration has been its neglect of Russia 's needs in the year since the collapse of the Soviet Union . American stinginess ( not to mention that of the Europeans and the Japanese ) has made President Boris Yeltsin 's task vastly more arduous and has strengthened the hand of the hard-liners , who are once again trying to reverse the economic reforms at the current meeting of the Russian Congress . <p> Despite the great stakes of the West in the success of Russia 's reforms , actual Western support has been minuscule . Indeed , the contrast of high-sounding rhetoric and little real support has had an enormously corrosive effect on Russian politics . The reformers have been derided for trusting in the West . Hard-liners have urged a return to inward-looking policies , declaring that the West has shown itself to be unreliable and hostile to Russia 's efforts . <p> The mismanagement of the aid effort is a startling tale . On October 28 , 1991 , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia would embark on the most dramatic democratic and market reforms in history . This remarkable speech was followed by silence from Western leaders . A few weeks later Yeltsin appointed a government of brilliant young reform economists , wisely skipping two generations of economists who Yeltsin sensed were still mired in the misconceptions of the old system . <p> The leading finance officials of the Western governments arrived soon after in Moscow . One would assume that these officials met with the new Russian government to see how the West could help with the mind-boggling task of stabilizing the Russian economy . But the purpose was rather different . The officials spent the entire week pressing Russia and the other republics to continue paying the interest on the old Soviet debt , an impossible demand , given the lack of financial reserves . The new Russian government signed on , despite the sure knowledge that it would have to default on the agreement within days . <p> In January Secretary of State James Baker convened a White House meeting of more than forty countries to discuss Western assistance  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration was more interested in a smooth meeting than in substance . Afraid that the Russian government might use the occasion to appeal for meaningful financial assistance , Baker did not invite a single Russian official to participate . There was no talk about Russia 's real financial needs , only about highly visible " humanitarian assistance , " such as food credits , which fell far short of Russia 's actual needs . <p> At that point the G-7 countries assigned the International Monetary Fund to be the West 's agent in Russia 's reforms . One should have some sympathy for the organization . It is the only one in the world that has a relatively clear view of how Russia can most effectively reform its economy , and that speaks clearly about the urgent need for Russia to cut its budget deficit and get its monetary policy under control . But it also is an exceedingly cautious bureaucracy , unwilling to take initiatives unless strongly prodded by the leading Western governments . Sure enough , the IMF took its cue from the G-7 last January when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial help in 1992 . <p> In March the Russian government demanded from the IMF a professional assessment of its financial needs . To the IMF 's credit , it reversed its position and acknowledged that in fact Russia 's financial needs were significant . Partly as a result of this , and partly due to political hammering on Bush by Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton about the need to do more for Russia , the G-7 governments announced a $24 billion aid package on April 1 . This had one crucial effect . It helped the reformers in the spring session of the People 's Congress make it through the political pitched battle with the hard-liners . <p> The Russian government immediately asked the IMF for a detailed description of the $24 billion program . There had been no discussions of specific projects , the organization of the aid effort , or even the sources of the funds . And alas , the IMF could n't come up with an explanation of the program . It devised four contradictory explanations over four months , admitting in private that there really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much support Russia might receive from various sources , including the IMF , World Bank , Western governments , and debt rescheduling . Again , it was not the IMF 's fault : there was simply no G-7 policy to grab on to . <p> In the end , there was no organized aid effort at all . Russia received about $8 billion in short-term credits to import grains and other basic goods . Most of these loans had actually been arranged in 1991 and were simply being implemented in 1992 . Since these are short-term credits , about $2.5 billion is coming due in 1993 ( not to mention the amounts on the pre-1992 loans ) , and Russia will be unable to pay it off . Russia received another $500 million or so in humanitarian grants . The IMF lent $1 billion this summer , but under the proviso that the funds not be touched in 1992 . And the World Bank has lent $600 million , with another $100 million to $200 million on its way , perhaps by the end of the year . Russia 's debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though a serious effort to do so is finally under way . <p> All in all , the Western effort has amounted to around $10 billion of unstructured lending : no program , no timetable , no attempt to link the vast majority of the funds to actual reform measures . In the absence of significant international assistance , the Russian reformers have had to make unappetizing and risky compromises , such as occurred after the April session of the People 's Congress , with an inflationary flood of money channeled to the military-industrial complex . The government also acceded to demands of the hard-line parliamentarians for a change in Central Bank management . The old head of the Central Bank under Gorbachev became the new head of the Russian Central Bank . Although the government thought it was making a few modest concessions , the results have been close to disastrous . The Central Bank promoted an explosive growth of the money supply by issuing credits to the old industrial dinosaurs . The money supply rose around three times in five months ( nearly 30 percent per month ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink of hyperinflation . Monthly inflation now runs at around 30 percent per month . <p> Fortunately , Russia still has some instincts for self-preservation . Yeltsin , his reform Cabinet , and even the Central Bank have recognized that Russia 's policy of unchecked subsidies to industry must be reversed . In late November Yeltsin issued a decree making the Central Bank part of the government , rather than under the control of the Parliament , where the industrial lobby holds sway . This may or may not be an empty gesture . All will depend on Yeltsin 's political strength in the coming weeks and months . And as before , that strength will depend largely on whether he finally receives meaningful support from the West . <p> The situation is dangerous but far from hopeless . In fact , although the monetary situation is abysmal , much else about the economic reforms is looking bright . The public is not only acquiescing in but is actually supporting the move to a market system . There has been no social explosion , no important unrest at the grass roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thousands of enterprises converting themselves into joint stock companies under the guidelines of the government 's privatization program . The government is distributing " privatization checks " to every Russian citizen , which may be used to buy shares in state-owned companies , in auctions that will start next month . <p> Decentralized , market-based behavior is taking root throughout Russia . Enterprises in the Urals and in Siberia are engaged in extensive barter trade with Chinese firms . Manufacturing enterprises are waking up to export opportunities in the West . Yes , there is massive smuggling in order to avoid taxes and to keep funds outside the countries , but perhaps more important , there is an enormous growth in market-oriented trade . Although virtually all Russians complain about the various " mafias " that direct the flow of goods , there is much more competition and honest trade than when the society was run by the one vast mafia of the Communist Party . <p> Even the decline in industrial production should not be mourned . As in Eastern Europe , much of the shrinkage is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectors of the economy . A new service sector is taking root , seen most clearly in the tens of thousands of kiosks that have opened up in Moscow in recent months . In Poland over the past three years the same transformation  --  from heavy industry to services and consumer industries  --  has led to a successful remaking of the economy , a process that most Poles enthusiastically endorse . Incidentally , even the most feared consequence of reforms , unemployment , remains at a mere 1 percent of Russia 's labor force , vastly below the unemployment rates of market economies . Unemployment will grow , surely , but along with the growth of new opportunities in the economy . <p> The key for Russia is to persevere in the basic four lines of reform : macroeconomic stabilization , liberalization of economic activity , privatization of state-owned resources , and construction of a social safety net to support the vulnerable groups in the population left behind by the market changes . Stabilization is most urgent , since a real hyperinflation could derail all of the rest of the reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack by the old guard ( who think about heavy industry and almost nothing else ) , the West still has a chance to play a pivotal role by supporting the main themes of reform . <p> Assuming that the reformers survive the coming political onslaught , as looks likely , the urgent need will be to reinforce the stabilization program in January and carry forward on the rest of the reforms . The Western assistance in 1993 should be geared to provide maximum political and economic support to the basic contours of reform . Rather than announcing a pile of cash , as the G-7 did in April , the West should work with the Russians to establish a series of projects , each directed at a key aspect of reform . The following kind of package makes sense : <p> An emergency social fund , to help pay for unemployment compensation , emergency medical support , and supplements to pensioners . The fund would be supported by direct grants of the Western countries , on the order of $8 billion in total ( of which the U.S. share would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allay current anxieties that the unemployed will be left to fend for themselves . Obviously , such a fund would help to cover direct budgetary needs without resort to the ruble printing press . <p> An industrial restructuring fund , to help pay for military conversion and other industrial restructuring operations . This money would be in the form of long-term loans from export credit agencies , the World Bank , and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development . About $8 billion per year could be divided among military conversion , agroindustry , and energy development . <p> A small business loan program , modeled on U.S. efforts in Poland and Czechoslovakia , to make hundreds of thousands of loans throughout Russia to small private-sector enterprises . Such a fund , lending about $1 billion per year , could be managed by the EBRD . <p> Balance of payments support from the IMF , to help cover foreign exchange needs , both for imports and for currency stabilization . The money would be divided between a normal IMF loan , of about $4 billion , and a special ruble stabilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's payments on the old Soviet debt would be deferred , though not canceled . <p> The direct U.S. budgetary costs would be about $3 billion per year ( about 1 percent of defense spending ) , with the rest covered by Western Europe , Japan , the international financial institutions , and off-budget export credit agencies . As with the support going to Eastern Europe , the financial package would not be enough to rebuild Russia ( a task properly left to the Russians ) , but it would be pivotal in helping the economic reforms take root . <p> This is the kind of program that could fire up the imagination of the millions of Russians trying to find their place in Russia 's rapidly changing order . They would have vastly more confidence that basic needs would be met in the event of unemployment ; a better chance to start a private business ; and hope for their factory 's future if it is eligible for long-term restructuring assistance . All Russians would be aided by a stable , convertible currency made possible by meaningful support from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of package on the table and monitor its implementation . And only the president of the United States can lead the G-7 to take these steps . With some forethought by the new Clinton team , January 1993 can mark a period of decisive regeneration for Russia as well as for the United States . <p> By Jeffrey Sachs <p> <p> Jeffrey Sachs is professor of economics at Harvard University and an economic adviser to the Russian government . <p>
