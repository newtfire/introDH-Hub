When the Kaiser 's Germany was beaten , the victors rejoiced in an old , simple and true belief that it is good to tear down the mighty who abuse their strength . That was not , however , the whole truth about World War I. Germany had been invited on the path of conquest by the weakness east and west of her borders . <P> In the years that led to World War II , the guilt of the weak was even more apparent . The outside world was no more Hitler 's victim than it was its own . Divided , hesitant , cynical and lazy , it let the evil grow and smoothed the way to catastrophe . <P> This week the U.S. , Britain and France made another pact with Germany ( see INTERNATIONAL ) . This one , at least , lacked the fatuous overconfidence of the last . Victors and vanquished were far more keenly aware of the dangers ahead . The fact of the peace itself and all the terms of the contract were influenced by the threat of Communist aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat was less ; if the West fell apart or stagnated , the threat would grow . <P> Germany itself was the index of the future . It would have nothing to gain from deserting a strong and united anti-Communist world . If might , however , be tempted to use its great vigor aggressively again , or to make another deal with the Reds if the Western alliance faltered . <P> How well the alliance would work was largely up to its leader , the U.S. It would have to avoid the illusion of safety , the guilt of weakness .
