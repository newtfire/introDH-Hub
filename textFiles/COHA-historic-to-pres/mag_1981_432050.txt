LIFE/STYLE  | Each morning , while her office colleagues sip coffee at their desks , she slips alone into the women 's lounge for her own kind of refreshment break . Glancing furtively around , she extracts the 25-cc container of methadone from her purse , gulps it , then washes it down with a soft drink . " I do n't talk much because I do n't want them to find out , " says Vickie , a $1,700-a-month designer for an Atlanta engineering firm . " They think I 'm a snotty bitch , but can you imagine telling some broad in your office you 're a junkie ? " The other women in the office no doubt would be shocked . So would the wealthy Houston insurance salesman whose 25-year-old daughter secretly quaffs methadone at home to kick the heroin habit she started at college . So would the two doctors and several lawyers whose sons and daughters began using heroin chasers with their cocaine in a " young swingers " apartment building in suburban New Jersey . Says a 28-year-old alumnus of the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crowd are dead , some have disappeared . I hear the others are still getting high . " Epidemic ' : Addicts like these do not fit the classic mold of the slumbound street junkie , but they are scarcely unusual . For thousands of middle-class teen-agers and young adults , heroin has become the deadly new kick . Jaded with pot , pills and cocaine , intrigued by a pure and potent new opium strain from Asia , the children of affluence are venturing where once the poor and desperate nodded out . The drug is being retailed at rock clubs , at Hollywood parties , and among lunch-time crowds in predominantly white business districts . Even drugtreatment officials profess astonishment at the clean-cut new breed of heroin addicts they are seeing . " When I first came here I was shocked by the people , " says Shirley Gordon , director of Atlanta 's Southside Methadone Treatment Center . " They look just like me and you . " Experts emphasize that heroin is still mainly a ghetto problem . Marijuana and cocaine remain the chief recreational drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white heroin addicts is turning up most visibly in the hip purlieus of the East and West coasts and the troubled Arcadias of the Sun Belt , while authorities elsewhere report no significant change in their addict populations . But there is an especially dangerous attractiveness in the current crop of high-powered , high-purity heroin . " This is n't dirty brown Mexican , " says psychopharmacist Ronald Siegel of the University of California , Los Angeles . " It 's fit for the tablecloths of England . It 's clean , it 's chic . " And its sheer abundance is prompting concern about a potential " epidemic " spilling across demographic divides . The new users are putting their own middle-class stamp on the habit . Most shun  |p63A  " mainlining " ? injecting heroin in a vein ? because it evokes images of street junkies and overdose deaths in squalid tenement hallways . They prefer a more antiseptic high : snorting the drug like cocaine , or dissolving it and inhaling the vapors , or " skinpopping " ? a superficial shot in a muscle . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even sprinkle it on the end I : of a marijuana joint and smoke it , a method that has found particular favor among California users . Many are no more than " chippers " ? occasional users ? or what Carroll Benson , director of Atlanta 's Midtown Drug Treatment Center , describes as " weekend junkies . They tend to be in a stable job Monday through Friday , and Friday night they stick a needle in their arms . Ritual ' : This cautious , intermittent use seems to provide an illusion of safety , or even probity , for people too young to remember the ugly lessons of past drug epidemics . " We 're not skid-row junkies , we 're respectable people , " insists Kathy , a 19-year-old San Franciscan who began dabbling in heroin last year . Middle-class users also offer cheery testimonials to the drug 's virtues . sounding not unlike TV endorsements for an extra-strength painkiller . " Heroin gives you a warm feeling , relaxed and mellow , " says Connie ( not her real name ) , 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a three-month fling with heroin in Florida . Yet experts warn that heroin is addictive no matter how it is ingested or how briefly used . As tolerance levels build up , dosage increases , and snorters can be hooked as surely as mainliners . One young East Coast businessman began snorting after his father died two years ago . It was the start of a $600-a-day habit that led him , finally , to the Fair Oaks treatment center in Summit , N.J. " It was my whole life ? it replaced love , it replaced pain ; I was totally engulfed in the ritual , " he recalls . The resurgence of heroin is partly a con-sequence of the recurring boom-and-bust cycle in the narcotics trade . A combination of diplomatic suasion and cooperative international law enforcement succeeded in staunching the Turkish and Mexican supplies that fueled the heroin epidemic of the 1960s and early 1970s . By 1978 the flow was down to a relative trickle , and the estimated U.S. addict total of 400,000 was the lowest on record . But by then drug traffickers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of Iran , Pakistan and Afghanistan . In 1979 that region 's poppy growers harvested a bumper crop of more than 1,500 metric tons of opium ? around twenty times the size of the 1970 Turkish harvest and enough to render 150 tons of heroin . With political turmoil in the Crescent thwarting crackdown efforts , much of the new crop has been making its way to U.S. markets ? mainly via Italy and West Germany . The potency of the Asian heroin is even more disturbing to drug officials than its volume . Purity levels as high as 90 per cent @#  | have been found in seized wholesale caches , with street-level purities averaging up to 20 per cent ? around six times the typical strength of the 1970 Turkish brand . The high purity gives the heroin a shimmering whiteness that makes it look no more threatening than Ivory Snow ? or cocaine ? though it is actually more lethal and addictive in equal doses than weaker strains . And it has helped create a bull market in the drug . A New York state Senate committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.2 pounds of 90 per cent pure wholesale heroin costing about $200,000 in the metropolitan New York area can be cut into 640,000 doses at $100 a dose . Gross revenues : about $64 million a kilo . " To exploit the boom , dealers use what one drug-treatment specialist calls " sophisticated marketing techniques , like the ones used to sell soap . " To help buyers find the potency they can tolerate , for example , dealers are labeling their packages with colored tape ( red for a " dynamite high " ) . Another ploy : starting new users on high-purity heroin at bargain prices , which builds up need quickly ; then diluting the dose once the customer is hooked , so that he must buy more to meet his needs ? at higher prices . Safe Conduct : One of the early signs that heroin trade was no longer off limits to middle-class shoppers came in September 1979 , when David Kennedy , a son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy , reported that he had been beaten and robbed in a Harlem hotel that police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then , some dealers have relocated to less dangerous " transitional " neighborhoods . And a few are even providing their own security patrols to ensure safe conduct for their clientele .  |p64B  When the Asian heroin first appeared , a generation of potential users was seemingly waiting for it , prepared by decades of casual pill-popping and , more recently , cocaine chic . " If you 're into recreational drug use , " says Frank McGurk , director of Manhattan 's Greenwich House treatment center , " whatever good and new comes along gets tried out . " Dr. Robert Millman , an addiction specialist at New York 's Payne-Whitney Clinic , agrees that cocaine opened the doors to the harder drug . " The same people who would have run out of the room at the mention of heroin a few years ago are buying it intermittently and using it , " Millman observes . " It 's become another white powder to them , and they do n't have to inject it or cop it on the street . Where you used to go to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cocaine ? ' , you now hear , Would you like some Uptown cocaine or Downtown heroin ? ' " But there may be a more compelling connection between the two drugs . Because cocaine produces a swift , surging high , users often need something to " come down " with , once the initial euphoria wears off . As a result , drug connoisseurs often take cocaine and heroin together ? a potent mixture called a " speedball " ? or in alternating doses . " When people have been using a stimulant drug like cocaine , they tend to end up with a sedative drug like heroin , " says Yale psychiatry professor Herbert Kleber , who runs a New Haven , Conn. , drug-treatment program that includes the children of business and political leaders among its patients . Although some drug counselors insist that heroin addiction is not a novelty among the middle class ? it has always cut across socioeconomic lines , they argue ? the phenomenon is clearly spreading . One rehabilitation expert , Edward Flowers of Washington 's Second Genesis center , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in middle-class society . The number of middleclass patients at Second Genesis has doubled in the past three years , Flowers says . And while heroin arrests are actually down in many cities , some authorities believe the figures are meaningless . " These are not the sort of people who get arrested , " says Rick Tibor of Los Angeles 's Do It Now Foundation . " They do n't have to steal toasters and TV sets to support their habits . " Indeed , one difference in middle-class addicts may be that they do their stealing at home . One patient at New York 's Daytop Village says that to pay for his heroin he was looting his father 's business . " Once I got $50 from my grandmother to buy some clothes , and I went out and spent it on heroin , " says Kathy of San Francisco . But other than " writing some bad checks to Safeway for a while , " she adds , she has never had to steal , " because somebody 's always got money . " Rock star John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hocked houses , cars and paintings to support a $1 million-a-year heroin habit for himself and NEWSWEEK/AUGUST 10 , 1981  |p64D  his wife , before he was arrested for dealing . Phillips has since undergone treatment and become an anti-drug crusader in company with his daughter , actress Mackenzie Phillips , a reformed cocaine user . Some authorities see limits to the spread of the heroin habit : the drug has retained its sinister image for most Americans , even the pill-poppers and coke-snorters . But addiction has been steadily growing over the past few years . Narcotics officials estimate that there are now about 450,000 heroin addicts in the United States , and they fear that a cheaper , still more potent strain of opium from the original " Golden Triangle " of Laos , Burma and Thailand ? expected to reach this country 's shores as early as the fall ? could more than double that total by the mid- ' 80s . Over the long run , narcotics agencies can do little to control the tidal ebb and flow of heroin . At best , they can damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stress : No one knows why heroin has become so widespread among the middle class . Answers range from the specific influence of the rock culture to the general breakdown of middle-class values . But some experts believe that many people seem no longer able , or willing , to handle stress without a palliative drug . " They are refusing to accept pain , " says Donald Russakoff , a regional director of the Therapeutic Communities of America . " Youngsters are growing up that way . They are being told they do n't have to deal with pain in any sense , from headaches to anything that 's bothering you . It 's hard to say whose fault it is , but it happened . " In fact , the use of all drugs continues to rise among all classes of people ? from alcohol and over-the-counter potions through prescription drugs like Valium to hard drugs like heroin . Authorities fear that this is more than a problem of individual addiction . They now worry about the graver threat of an addictive society . 64D     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
