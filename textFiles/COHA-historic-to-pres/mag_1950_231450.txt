Last week nine million West Germans in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia - which includes the Ruhr-went to the polls to elect a new state legislature . It was the second free election in Germany since the Nazis , and the quietest yet . By evening the voters , mostly miners and steelworkers , representing one-fourth of all voters in West Germany , had smashingly rejected both Communists and extreme right-wing Nationalist parties . <P> When the votes were counted , the Christian Democrats had won 36.9% , the Social Democrats a strong 32.4% , the right-of-center Free Democrats 12.1% . The Reds kept only twelve out of their 28 seats-representing 5.5% of the total votes . Communist Leader Max Reimann was beaten in his own constituency . <P> The state 's electorate was also voting on a proposed new constitution whose most important articles were 1 ) the right of parents to send their children to denominational schools ; 2 ) socialization of certain " monopolistic " Ruhr industries . By week 's end it seemed probable that the new constitution had been adopted , but the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual nationalization of the plants .
