Other countries might have produced such a journalist , but only in the U. S. could he exist today . In Germany or Italy he would be in prison or silent ; in Russia , dead ; in France , a partisan among partisans ; in England , anonymous ; in Japan , inconceivable . Only in a kind where the banner of a free press still proudly flaps could such a journalistic phenomenon as Walter Lippmann rise and continue to shine . Last week , however , Walter Lippmann rose and shone in a new quarter of the political firmament . <P> Plague to Both Houses . A journalist but his own master , a columnist but a dignified writer , a pundit almost without pomp , the master of a lucid style which thrice multiplies the effect of his political criticism , Walter Lippmann has been a marked man even among the small company of those for whom journalism is not a trade but a profession . Hence during half-a-dozen years of political crisis he has commanded , from his eight million readers , a respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , at the very least , disturbing . <P> Actually he has disturbed not one but two antipodal regimes . Six years ago , when a Republican Administration was dying of slow political and economic tuberculosis , Herbert Hoover , sitting down to his breakfast and his worries , used to turn regularly to the editorial page of the arch-Democratic New York World to read Walter Lippmann 's dispassionate discussion of his shortcomings . When in recent months Franklin Roosevelt , sitting up in bed with his breakfast and his grin , has occasionally picked up the arch-Republican New York Herald Tribune , he has found no less disconcerting reading in Walter Lippmann 's column ' ' Today &; Tomorrow . " <P> Milestones . This change of target on Lippmann 's part did not coincide with his change of employment from a Democratic to a Republican paper . For the first three months of the Roosevelt Administration he was one of its strongest supporters . At the end of six months he had begun to speak of the " dictatorial spirit " of NRA , although he continued for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been right . " By the end of two years he reached the point of saying , " The courts will do an historic service not only to the nation as a whole but to recovery and reform , to the President and his Party , if they liquidate a major part of the centralized regulation to which the New Deal has committed itself . " <P> When four years had nearly gone , Lippmann announced : " I am going to vote for Governor Landon ; " but not with elation , not without misgivings voiced as criticism of Landon 's campaign . Not until last spring , after Franklin Roosevelt launched his Supreme Court plan , did Pundit Lippmann , who had steadily grown more critical of " personal government , " turn to outright condemnation . <P> So Lippmann alienated a large group of his former admirers , liberals who had once stood with him against Hoover , who now stand with Roosevelt against Lippmann . To them Lippmann as an opponent of the New Deal is a man convicted of treason to progressive social ideals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meretricious appeals of Bourbonism.
