A stronger dollar swells prices <P> <P> The dollar can do no right , at least in the eyes of Europeans . When the greenback was plummeting almost daily last year , moneymen in strong currency nations like West Germany and Switzerland screamed that their goods were being priced out of the U.S. market . Now their complaints have changed . The newly revived dollar , strengthened by Jimmy Carter 's rescue operation last November , is quickening the inflationary pace all around Europe . As a result , Germany , Switzerland , France , Britain and Italy are suffering a severe case of racing prices . <P> The key culprit , of course , is not the dollar but oil . Crude imports are paid for in dollars , and in years gone by Europe got used to offsetting higher OPEC prices by the subsequent declines in the value of the dollar . Every time the dollar fell-and it nearly always fell when OPEC 's prices were raised-the real cost of oil hardly changed and sometimes actually became cheaper for countries with strong currencies . <P> No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of OPEC increases , the dollar has remained strong , largely because multinational money dealers believe that the U.S. Government is at last determined to protect its value by keeping interest rates high , reducing budget deficits and pursuing other anti-inflationary policies . Over the past six months the dollar has gained 21% against the Swiss franc and 11% against the West German mark . Consequently , Switzerland and West Germany , which import nearly 100% of their oil , have been hit by the full inflationary impact of the cartel 's rate rise . And this hurts : prices in Switzerland and Germany have shot up at an annual rate of 9% and 9.6% , respectively , in this year 's first quarter , compared with practically no increases in the preceding three months . Moreover , double-digit inflation now plagues every major European Community country . In the first quarter , prices in France rose at an annual rate of 10% , vs. 8.4% in the preceding quarter ; Britain suffered 12.4% , vs. 6% ; and Italy 17.6% , vs. 12% . <P> Oddly , Europe 's problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter , is no longer much higher than that of the strongest currency countries . While the gap may not close completely in the near future , this trend will add strength to the dollar , attract capital back to America , and reverse the once large dollar outflows . Europe , for its part , unfortunately may have to adopt more restrictive monetary , tax and spending policies and learn to live with higher unemployment as well as lower economic growth .
