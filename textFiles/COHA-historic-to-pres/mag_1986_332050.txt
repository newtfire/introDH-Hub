There are good reasons why Administration officials played it coy on the subject of whether they intended to kill Gaddafi with a well-aimed bomb . For one thing , acknowledging such an attempt could provoke a political fire storm . But more important , the idea of killing a leader raises difficult legal and moral issues , issues that the Administration seems unwilling and unready to confront publicly . <P> If the raid was in fact a veiled execution attempt , it would pit the Reagan Administration against a specific presidential order and substantial legal precedent . In 1976 , after public discontent over the revelations of cia assassination attempts in Chile , Guatemala and Iran , President Ford issued an Executive Order forbidding the Government from authorizing the assassination of world leaders . Both Presidents Carter and Reagan have reaffirmed that ban . <P> In discussing whether the Administration had tacitly hoped to kill Gaddafi , Secretary of State George Shultz seemed to be engaged in a kind of Jesuitic legal maneuvering . " We did not have a strategy saying we wanted to go after Gaddafi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general stance that opposes direct efforts of that kind . " The implication is that if the attempt was indirect and unofficial , they would be off the hook . <P> But some experts suggest that the Administration need not engage in any protective hairsplitting . They argue that Reagan 's risk in superseding Executive Order No. 12333 would be political rather than legal . The Executive Order represents a voluntary restraint rather than a legally imposed one . By violating it , the President is not breaking a law but a promise . Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger speculates that the President could have sidestepped any legal problems by issuing a secret National Security directive sanctioning action against Gaddafi . <P> The question prompted by an assassination attempt , say some , is more a moral issue than a political one . Critics of the Administration suggest that the Government 's actions have undermined American claims of moral superiority , reducing the U.S. to the same level as the terrorists it condemns . If the Administration did intend to get Gaddafi , notes former Carter Legal Adviser Lloyd Cutler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a foreign leader . " <P> There are those who think that the U.S. erred on the side of restraint , that the Administration should have had the courage of their convictions  --  or their animosities . " If we genuinely believe that Gaddafi is more than just a booking agent for terrorism , " says Robert Kupperman , a terrorism expert at Washington 's Center for Strategic and International Studies , " then covert means of getting rid of him should be considered . We seem to be dealing in niceties . We think we can use the larger instruments of warfare to bring about his elimination , but that we should n't use the smaller ones , such as a pistol .
