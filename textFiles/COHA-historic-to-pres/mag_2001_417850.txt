// We took a shortcut through the mountains , a logging road that climbed above the clouds . Dad drove slowly . Under the snow was ice , and we slithered round the bends . " I would n't try this without fourwheel drive , " he said , and laughed . " Or a team of oxen , like the poor Vanderlees . " " Who ? " I asked . " You 've never heard of Titus Vanderlee ? " He shook his head . " What do they teach you in school these days ? " The Bronco shuddered through a switchback . " The Vanderlees came west in a wagon train , " he said . " A hundred wagons-a thousand oxen-so many that it slowed them down , and it was winter when they reached the mountains . They had to wait for spring . " The car lurched on a patch of ice . " Titus Vanderlee did n't want to wait " said Dad . " Stubborn man ; he said he 'd get through the mountains or bust . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but others did . Six wagons in all . " " Along this road ? " " It was n't here yet , " said Dad . " But this is the route . This is Vanderlee Pass . " He steered through a curve . " The others watched the wagons climb up through the clouds . And that was the last that anyone ever saw of them . Alive , at any rate . " " What do you mean ? " I asked . Dad pressed the gas and started up a rise . " My mother-your grandmother-told me the clouds over the mountains were the Vanderlee wagons drifting along . She said the Vanderlees were swallowed by the sky . But others say they 're still there , that sometimes you can hear .... " He did n't finish . The Bronco mounted the crest and came right away to a corner . Dad cranked the wheel ; suddenly he shouted . Everything seemed to spin around me . The car tilted , my head banged against the window , and the next thing I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Are you all right ? " His voice was like an echo . I could still feel the car tilting and spinning . " You 've been out for nearly an hour , " said Dad . " You scared me . " He turned on the light , a tiny bulb . But it shot terrible pains through my head . There was a lump above my ear as big as a baseball . The car sat at a slant , the windows frozen with our frosted breath . " I 'm cold , " I said . " I know . " Dad sighed , then turned off the light and started the car . The air grew warmer , melting the ice from the windshield . I saw a field of snow bright with moonlight . We had fallen six feet , onto a ledge . By skill or by luck , Dad had steered into the trunk of a pine tree , the only thing that had stopped us from tumbling 600 feet more . He peered into my eyes . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going for help . " He showed me how to stop and start the car . But he warned me not to run it often . " Why not ? " I asked . " We 're low on gas . " His face crumpled . " I 'm sorry , son . A shortcut that nobody uses . No food , no water , no shovel . Surprise your mother ! " He barked a little laugh . " Ha ! Would n't she be surprised to see us now . " " Dad , it 's O.K , " I said . He patted my shoulder and got out of the car , wading through snow to the road . He turned up his collar , thrust his hands in his pockets and puffed white breaths as he got smaller and smaller . When he shrank round a corner , I had never felt so lonely . I slept until the cold woke me . Then I ran the car , slept and ran it again . I was scared of the silence , of the cold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found comfort in the purr of the engine . Shadows swept over the snow . I looked at the moon , saw it half covered by clouds , and thought of the Vanderlee wagons drifting along . I remembered Dad saying there was something you could hear . Something about the Vanderlees . The wind came down to the ground , sending swirls of snow slithering over the windshield . I was watching them when I heard a thud on the roof . A sudden bang , it set my heart racing , the blood roaring through my head . And then I heard it again . // Stories rushed into my mind , campfire tales that came to me whole in that instant : a man with a hook for a hand ; a lady stranded in a car with a maniac on the loose . " Get out of there , " the police told her . " And whatever you do , do n't look back . " I wished I had n't remembered those stories . They made me think of the Vanderlees , vanished in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes you can hear .... " What ? I wondered . There was another thud . Louder . I imagined a man up there , a maniac with a hook instead of a hand . I locked the doors , then huddled in the middle , staring through the windows , waiting for his hook to appear , his face . Something moved-only a swirl of snow . And I smiled at my fears . Thump ! It shocked me more than the first time . It was as though the maniac had waited to catch me off my guard . Stop thinking that , I told myself . I had to get out before I went crazy . Quietly , I worked the lock ; I turned the handle very slowly . Then I shoved the door and hurled myself out . I fell into snow , got to my feet and stumbled again . I clawed like a spider trying to escape from a sink . Do n't look back , I thought . But I did . On top of the car were big dollops of snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on the roof with a thud . I laughed out loud . It echoed back like a crazy man 's cackle . My shoes , my jacket , even the cuffs of my pants were stuffed full of snow . I scattered big lumps of it over the seat when I got back in the car and started the motor . I held my shivering hands to the heater vents . And the car spluttered and stopped . I cranked the key , but it did n't help . The cold came rushing back and , wet to the skin , I shivered and cried . Frost coated the windows , sealing me in blackness . My face tingled then went numb . My hands and feet did the same . I was freezing to death , but there was nothing that I could do to keep warm . I fell asleep , woke and slept , then woke again to sounds outside . They were muffled and strange , a jingle and creak . My hands were so cold that the frost felt hot when I scraped it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard the useless hum of the heater , switched on the wipers and headlights . An inch of snow fell from the windshield , and I saw thousands of snowflakes tumbling through the silvery beams of the headlights . The sound grew louder , and around the curve came a covered wagon , swaying from side to side . A man on its seat was wrapped in a blanket ; his oxen were dusted with white . Behind him came another wagon , another after that , creaking toward me with a jingle of harness . The Vanderlees , I thought . It scared the blood from my body to see them , the breath from my lungs . I could neither move nor shout as the wagons stopped beside me , as men in fur coats waded down to the Bronco . They opened the door . They reached in and carried me out . The next thing I knew , I was lying in a bed , in a room made warm by a wood stove . There was one small window in the walls of plain boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside me . She smiled . " You 're awake , and he 'll be glad to hear it . " " Who ? " I asked . " Well , do n't you know ? " She stood up . " Are you fit to travel ? " " Where ? " I said . " What 's happened ? " " Hush , " she said . " I 'll fetch him in . " " Is it my father ? " She left without answering . I lay bundled in blankets , not sure where I was or how I 'd got there . I did n't see the man come into the room , or hear him until he spoke from the foot of the bed . " It 's dawn , " he said . " We should be on our way . " It was n't my father . This man was enormous , with shaggy hair and a flaming-red beard . Though the room was stifling , he wore a coat of thick fur . A picture came to my mind of that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who are you ? " I asked . He stepped to the corner of the bed . " Who do you think I am ? " I was too scared to answer , but I knew who it was , the man or his ghost I saved you , boy . " He came up to my side , his hand reaching out He asked me again , " Who do you think I am ? " I looked in his eyes , and they were ancient and sad . I ached to speak , but could n't . " Do n't you know ? " he asked . " Do n't you know who I am ? " I was opening my mouth , trying to talk-to tell him-when he passed between me and the window . The light shone through him , his clothes and his body glowing like swirls of dust . He touched me , his fingers colder than ice , and I shouted , " Dad ! " I screamed for my father . " Help me ! " I cried . And the bearded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it all turned white . Then I was back in the car , and the door was flung open , full of bright sunshine and a shimmering cloud of tiny snowflakes . My dad was there , his hand on my shoulder . " It 's all right , " he said . " I 'm here . It 's all right now . " I heard a jingle of metal , the same sound I 'd heard when the wagons came , and I looked up at the road , at a bubbling mist of gray smoke . A man came walking from it , dragging a jingling chain . // " It 's the tow truck driver , " said Dad , sensing my fright . " You 're safe now , son . I 'm here . " I did n't know where I 'd been or how I 'd got back or how much time had passed . I just sat in a daze as Dad climbed into the car . " Let 's see if it starts , " he said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impossible , " said Dad . " But you 've been gone for days . " He stomped on the pedal . " I 'm sure it feels like days , but it 's only been four or five hours . " The engine whirred when he turned the key . It whirred and coughed and finally started . " You have to pump the pedal hard , " said Dad . He helped me up to the road , to a tow truck that was idling there , its gray exhaust clinging to the snow . I sat in the cab while Dad and the tow truck driver winched the Bronco from the ledge . I must have dreamed it all , I decided . The day and the night , wagons and house , had all been only a dream . We followed the tow truck down from the mountains . It left us far behind , with Dad driving slowly . I was surprised when he stopped beside a crumbled old building , a heap of snow-covered boards . " That 's where she lived , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the mountains in the spring , and would go no farther . She built this house and waited for Titus . " Dad stared at the building , then started driving again . " In her dotty old age she said his ghost would come to see her , sometimes bringing strangers . They would spend the night and leave at dawn . " I felt a chill in the heated Bronco . Dad was staring ahead , both hands on the wheel . There was one more thing I had to know . " What is it you can hear ? " I asked . " About the Vanderlees . " Dad laughed . " They say you can hear their wagons , and sometimes you can see the ghost of Titus Vanderlee . And he 'll take you with him wherever it is that he goes . He 'll take you away forever-if you only say his name . " <p>
