The students who used to ride the school bus home after football practice will be among the first to notice the impact of Lockport High School District 205 ' s deteriorating financial condition . They will have to find other ways to get home this season , because late-activity buses , long a feature of high school life in the district , will be curtailed to save $51 , 000 . That is only part of district efforts to balance a budget that carries an annual shortfall of nearly $1. 5 million and that school officials say will not be helped much by the recent increase in the state income tax . Other cuts will shave an additional $113 , 000 from the district ' s $15 million budget . Such cutbacks , officials say , are inevitable in a district whose voters have failed to approve a tax increase over the last two decades . But they are nothing compared to what is projected for the 1990-91 school year , when the district proposes closing its East campus , now used by freshmen and sophomores . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central campus . The district would eliminate transportation and extra-curricular activities all together . The 1990-91 cuts would reduce expenses by $1. 5 million and bring the system ' s revenue in line with expenses . The district , which includes Du Page , Homer and Lockport Townships in a booming area of eastern Will County , is under surveillance by the Illinois State Board of Education because of its poor financial performance . The gloomy scenarios for the system ' s 2 , 200 students come in a financial plan approved in July by the district board and presented to the state school board as part of the requirements to remedy its problems . District 205 is among a dozen districts in the state to be placed on " financial certification . " " Without adequate financial resources , continued operation of Lockport Township High School , as the community has come to expect , is threatened , " Supt. Donald Weber said in the report to the state school board . The district had tried to remedy its problem by proposing a merger with neighboring districts . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy that has been rejected by voters 10 times in the last 20 years : an increase in the district ' s education fund tax rate . " Our voters feel frustrated by taxes . On Chicago ' s Northwest Side the homeowners this summer are protesting their tax bills , but people here have felt that way towards taxes for a long time , " Weber said . The most-recent attempt , which would have boosted the education fund tax rate to $1. 32 per $100 assessed valuation from 92 cents , was defeated April 4 by a vote of 4 , 730 to 3 , 184 . As a result of the failure to increase taxes , the district has gone consistently deeper into debt . For the last two years it has had to borrow $2. 8 million in short-term loans known as teacher ' s orders so that it could meet its payroll . The burden of the interest adds to the district ' s financial woes . Of the district ' s total tax rate of $2. 24 per $100 assessed valuation , nearly 74 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district board is set to consider again an education tax rate increase proposal , which would be before voters on the Nov. 7 ballot . But also on the agenda will be a suggestion that would make the boost a little more palatable : The board is set to vote on a resolution that pledges it to put a ceiling on the district ' s tax rate at $2. 24 . By increasing revenue through the education fund rate increase , the district could reduce its borrowing , Weber said . The current payback period could be lengthened on district bonds and the various tax rates that make up the total tax rate could be accordingly adjusted so that the overall rate does not increase , he said.
