Illegal immigrants : Responses to " Modern-day slavery helps Florida 's farms thrive , " News , Dec. 7 <p> It does n't compare to black experience <p> At no point did the author mention that these " illegal immigrants " are breaking American law by their very presence here . <p> The things that are mentioned are abhorrent , but it cheapens what blacks endured  --  complete subjugation in America before the Civil War  --  to liken the experience of illegal migrant workers to that of African-Americans . <p> In order to rectify the problem , we should deport all illegal immigrants and let them get in line and apply for citizenship . <p> BILL OTTAWAY , Flowery Branch <p> They are criminals who can go home <p> Africans brought to our continent on slave ships had no choice , but today 's illegal aliens freely and willfully violate international borders , jeopardize their children 's lives and enter our country unlawfully to work , knowing full well what they are up against . <p> Any time they are not happy about their working conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a gun to their heads forcing them to cross our border . Harboring , aiding , abetting , employing and assisting illegal aliens is still a federal crime , whether or not it is enforced . <p> GALE NORBY , Buford <p> Calling it slavery is a bit of a stretch <p> Certainly , in all types of industry some forms of abuse take place  --  but to make the leap to modern-day slavery astounds me . <p> Of course , a person who crossed the border illegally and is now a criminal would probably be more likely to be associating with other lawbreakers . I am sure they would be subjecting themselves to possible mistreatment . <p> The solution to this problem would start with coming into our country legally and obeying our laws . Then and only then will one benefit from the protections they grant and enjoy everything good this country has to offer . <p> JAMES F. STAUB , Dahlonega <p> Remove incentives that lure them here <p> All the problems cited in the article would go away if the U.S. government would do its job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd quit giving away free medical care , food stamps , etc. , word would get out that the land of milk and honey is only for people who come here legally . Incentives to sneak across our borders should be taken away . <p> It 's a shame that the lawbreakers in Florida are being mistreated by other greedy lawbreakers . But again , enforcing the laws all the way around  --  punish companies that knowingly hire illegals and at the same time deport illegal immigrants as they are found  --  would solve the problems . <p> LOUISE STEWART , Norcross <p> Rest of us must demand change <p> I find it interesting that in a country that howls to other nations about human rights abuses , the government looks the other way when workers are mistreated right here inside its own borders . <p> This happens because the rich corporations are calling the shots , and until the rest of us wake up and demand change it will continue to happen . <p> LINDA EVANS , Matthews , N.C. <p> End economic barbarism <p> The article shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind eye to out-of-control illegal immigration . <p> The South has a history of using agricultural economics to justify slavery . Let 's not make it national economic policy . Slavery in any form is wrong . Let 's end it once and for all . We must stop illegal immigration and the economic barbarism that seeks its justification . <p> JIMMY HERCHEK , Lawrenceville <p> Marriage : Responses to Cynthia Tucker 's column " You may now diss the bride , " @issue , Dec. 7 <p> Show 's hypocrisy escaped many <p> What a great column . <p> I totally support gay and lesbian marriage , and I never thought of the hypocrisy of the publicized TV weddings until now . I guess we overlook the obvious sometimes . <p> I have been active in writing to my elected representatives . Too many citizens just sit back and let those with the squeaky wheels be heard , even though " the moral majority " is neither . <p> Thanks to Tucker for speaking out on what should be common sense . <p> DEBORAH A. FRISCHKNECHT , Clarkston <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows how truly out of touch she is with conservatives if she struggles to find any who denounce the mate-baiting shows on television , such as " Joe Millionaire " and " The Bachelor "  --  as if conservatives were the only ones who care about the sanctity of marriage in our nation . ( Liberals , are you ruffled by her assumption that you should not be bothered or vocal about such issues ? ) <p> Tucker 's rush to denounce conservatives as hypocrites is reminiscent of the biblical Pharisees , who refused to come into contact with sinners . Thorough introspection should reveal that not one of us is untouched by hypocrisy in our own lives . After all , are n't the organizers of the " Hate Bush " rally the same people who demand " tolerance " in our society ? <p> SHIRSTEN DREYER , Lawrenceville <p> Nail hit her head ? <p> Cynthia Tucker has hit the nail on the head  --  Republicans are behind the onslaught of " reality " television ! As the direct result of this , homosexuals can not marry and stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks for it . <p> With that kind of logic and with Tucker 's disdain for the same , too bad her parents were not gay or lesbian . We would have been spared such drivel . <p> TOMMY LEE MADDOX , Kennesaw <p> Needed : A license to kill publicity <p> Well said , and I could n't agree more . <p> One point that Cynthia Tucker did n't mention is that a license to marry is required , and it is the license that conveys the legal protections between spouses that gays currently do not have . <p> Just because they 're of the opposite sex , Trista and Ryan will have no problem getting a marriage license , and they will have those legal protections from Day One ( in addition to the publicity , of course ) . <p> SCARLOTT CAGLE , Alpharetta <p> Topic was overdue <p> I 've been waiting for someone , on the right or left , to bring this up . <p> " Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire ? " was disgusting  --  high-stakes prostitution on national television  --  and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> NEAL BYLES , Concord , N.H. <p> Howard Dean : Responses to George Will 's column " No evidence of Dean 's intellect , " @issue , Dec. 7 <p> He could n't even manage Vermont <p> I wholeheartedly agree with George Will 's column . <p> As a former Vermonter , I saw Howard Dean mud wrestle with legislators and leave his intemperate remarks on the foreheads of public officials . He spent his last two-year term preparing to run for the presidential nomination , leaving his own state in fiscal despair with an ever-increasing tax burden on its people and a regulatory debacle regarding the state 's largest private hospital . <p> Dean 's ambitions outweigh his intellect by a country mile . If he can not competently govern a state with only 600,000 people , then he is certainly not suitable to run for president . <p> TORIN TOGUT , Lawrenceville <p> Will is not so smart himself <p> It is amusing that George Will , who considers himself so intelligent that he can attack Howard Dean for his lack of intellect , fails to grasp a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only reason that any of the Democratic presidential candidates are suggesting civil unions instead of gay marriage is that people on the religious right are dead set against it . However , a same-sex civil union would give all the same benefits and obligations , at least in terms of civil law . The only remaining difference is what is bestowed by the church involved ( if any ) , which is out of the government 's jurisdiction . To pretend anything else is being disingenuous , at best . <p> KEITH KAYLOR , Atlanta <p> A free and democratic Iraq is imperative <p> Thomas Friedman is right ( " Bush alters stand on Iraq as burden of office grows , " @issue , Dec. 7 ) . However devious the original intention regarding Iraq and however deeply we must seek the truth involved for future use by our democracy , nevertheless we have the first opportunity in modern history to impose freedom on a people , whether they want it now or not . We must not fail in this task , for our own future security depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now must become a crusade in the most noble meaning . It is our obligation as the standard bearers of freedom in this world to make sure that Iraq is and remains free . Let 's root out any profiteering involved in this project , to be sure , but let 's not forget our duty . Failing this , America has failed . <p> PHILIP McPHERSON RUDISILL , Atlanta <p> Blame who you want , war is Bush 's fault <p> I see that President Bush 's spin doctors are busy trying to distance him from the mess in Iraq ( " Cheney instigated war , which was n't the plan , " @issue , Dec. 7 ) . <p> The latest ploy is blaming Vice President Dick Cheney for duping Bush into attacking Iraq . I suspect this will be followed by dumping Cheney from the 2004 ticket for " health " reasons . But whether he was duped or did it on his own , Bush 's decision to rush us into an unwise and unnecessary war on Iraq has disqualified him for a second term . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait <p> Especially noteworthy in a book review Sunday ( Arts &; Books , Dec. 7 ) is this question in reference to the GOP : " How did the party that began as a protest against Democrats ' refusal to abolish slavery become home to this country 's most intolerant elements ? " <p> I imagine such party leadership would include a man who belonged to the Ku Klux Klan ( Robert Byrd ) , a man who succeeded in putting the Confederate flag atop his state Capitol ( Fritz Hollings ) , men who interned Japanese-Americans during World War II simply because of their race ( Earl Warren and Franklin Roosevelt ) and a man who wrestled a young boy , Elian Gonzalez , from the arms of freedom and handed him over to Fidel Castro ( Bill Clinton ) . <p> Intolerant , indeed . <p> MARC O'DELL , Alpharetta <p> Parking meters will chase away customers <p> Parking meters are not the solution to Atlanta 's financial problems and will do nothing but hurt businesses . <p> In areas such as East Atlanta , Virginia-Highland and Midtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival . I recently went to Sunday brunch in a Midtown restaurant . The wait at the restaurant was 45 minutes and brunch with friends lasted another hour . Afterward , we walked to the nearby businesses to do some shopping , and by the time we left we had racked up $8 in meter fees . I will never go back . <p> Eating , drinking and shopping in one area is the basis to the " new urbanism " concept , which is built around people not driving as much . But at $2 an hour , people are going to be getting back in their cars and leaving as fast as they can , heading to the free parking at the malls . <p> SHAWN ERGLE , Atlanta <p> The f-word : ' Decadent society ' a term that , sadly , fits <p> The Federal Communications Commission 's approval of the use of the f-word is evidence of the truth in the statement by Nikita Khrushchev . <p> As prime minister of the Soviet Union , he referred to the United States as a " decadent society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar of modernness . <p> CHESTER T. COHEN , Alpharetta <p> It 's the job of parents to be a shield <p> The letters I 've been reading berating the FCC for allowing the f-word to be said on television are incredibly off-the-mark  --  especially those written by people appalled that our children might be exposed to this terrible word . <p> Parents control this matter , not the FCC . Turn off the television , for goodness sake . Whether you want to hear it or not , TV rots children 's brains . If you are allowing your children to watch the types of programs where the f-word may be uttered , then whether they hear that particular word is the least of your worries , because the damage has most certainly already been done . <p> JANICE W. FAHY , Marietta <p> Plenty of ways city can raise cash <p> An editorial asked the Atlanta business community to help Mayor Shirley Franklin find new sources of revenue to pay for the $3 billion restoration of the city 's water and sewer system ( " Memo to CEOs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Recently , the Fulton County Taxpayers Association recommended the following " new sources of revenue . " <p> * Revenue enhancement : A moderate $100 annual commuter tax would generate approximately $50 million a year ; a gas tax of 10 cents per gallon ( subject to the approval of the General Assembly ) would generate approximately $62 million a year ; a one-half percent increase in the city tax on liquor , beer and wine would generate approximately $12 million annually ; a $1 tax on parking in the city of Atlanta would generate approximately $22 million a year . <p> Once the sewer problem is corrected , these measures should be rescinded . <p> * Cutting costs : Privatizing city services  --  such as garbage collection , fleet management , information systems , parks and recreation , etc.  --  and consolidating duplicate city/county services ( such as courts , police and corrections , purchasing and public works ) could save the city more than $100 million annually . <p> JOHN SHERMAN <p> Sherman , of Atlanta , is president of the Fulton County Taxpayers Association . <p> Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Jimmy Carter 's recent lament that the appointment of Sen. Zell Miller ( D-Ga. ) was one of Gov . Roy Barnes ' biggest mistakes , may I suggest that the policies that Miller endorses have encouraged economic growth and preserved American security . <p> Perhaps Carter should revisit his own presidential administration and reconsider the policies he enacted , which inhibited growth and appeased American security . <p> Perhaps one of the American people 's biggest mistakes was electing Carter president . <p> BRIAN SCOTT JOHNSON , Tucker
