Thespians Have Taken to Arguing the Point with Patrons <P> Lately there has been an outbreak in the theatres of what might be called neighborly quarrels between the actors and the audiences who paid money to see them act . Early last season Richard Bennett when playing in repertoire for the Theatre Guild set the fashion by chiding audiences in the West , particularly in Detroit , for not showing a greater appreciation of his loving efforts to entertain . <P> Actor Bennett made quite a feature of stepping out of his part and rebuking the natives for not rallying in larger numbers around the cause of Art as upheld by him . <P> This season the same star has maintained the quaint custom . In Philadelphia recently he reproved an audience at The Dancers , more in anger than in sorrow , for not containing more Bennett enthusiasts per square foot . Quite a fuss resulted , though no blows were actually struck by either side . He has made such a name for himself in theatrical circles by this practice that now such an impulsive act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pulling a dick bennett . " <P> A few days ago E. H. Sothern , that expositor of all that is chaste , discreet and classic in thespic art , startled the stage world at Syracuse by pulling a dick bennett . He is reported in upstate despatches to have told a sparse audience for a Shakespearean performance that if Syracuse did not show more emphatic recognition of good plays , managers in the future who went out of the way to give that city worthwhile productions would pass by on the other side . He implied that theatre-goers there would be left to the mercy of burlesque shows , but to date the Syracuse Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Clubs have done nothing to stave off their doom . <P> John Barrymore is another actor who has been known to belabor audiences , though generally for giggling inopportunely , rather than for negligence . Morris Gest , when convoying an attraction on tour revels in such rows in the newspapers . It is doubtful if audiences do , or if the squabbles increase attendance through publicity . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scolded-they can get that at home . <P> Sometimes such wrangles lead to drastic action . Last week a vaudeville performer in Manhattan brazenly defied an audience to dislike him , and several spectators walked out . The next day the management yanked him off the bill . <P> F.V.
