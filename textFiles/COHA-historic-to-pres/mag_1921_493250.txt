NUMBER 368 The Week TURN-for a moment , Americans , from your play or your work . Imagine that through your street , prosperous , cheerfully lit , with its bakeries and butcher stores filled with every kind of thing to eat , you heard the sound of people coming , pass- g by , and coming again , an increasing stream , two or three thousand of them every hour . Imagine them pouring past you , day after day , week after : eelt , for all the hours of the day , with a monotony he only by the varying footfalls , vigorous or t , eeti Rle , or the short light steps of children . If all ussians who are dying from hunger , or disease that follows hunger , this day and tomorrow and ! vet " day until spring , could file past your window ' , Your street would be filled with a like procession , and Your soul haunted by it . How many hours coUld listen you listen to those uncountable muffled , shuntinglig footfalls , hinting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before you gave h : . nd many of your least necessary dollars toward Ping to make them less frequent ? Wish everyone who thinks of helping , and yet n ( lt reached the point of actually giving , could read the reports of the American Relief Administration 's agents in Russia , as published in the A. R. A. 's bulletin . Here we find detailed figures of the food shortage . In sixteen of the Central and Volga provinces , with a population of 40,000,000 , there is an average per capita shortage of 2os pounds of grain . In the six of these known as the " famine provinces " the shortage is 285 pounds per capita . If anyone will try to live on a daily pound of bread for a couple of weeks he will see what this means . No wonder that children in the Volga districts are described in the Bulletin by a relief worker as " worse than any children I had ever seen , and the effect of their white and wizened faces and toothpick legs was heightened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children will die before we can get food to them . " The case of the village of Saltygonovo , in the province of Kazan , may be taken as typical of what is happening in countless other small villages . " Before the migration started , there were 72o people in the place . . . so percent have left already , and they continue to leave , so that in about a month there will be none left . . . . One almost wondered how they could stand . They had the swollen bellies of ' grass eaters . ' " WHAT are we doing for the " grass-eaters " ? The President has asked Congress for an appropriation large enough to give the A. R. A. io , 000,000 bushels of corn and 1,000,000 bushels of seed grain . This suggested gift is not large , it comes late , and it is as yet only a recommendation . But let us be grateful for it . Let us be glad too , that the first bill passed by the Senate , where it was introduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand over his department 's surplus medical supplies to the A. R. A. for use in Russia . Medical relief is also being planned in the form of an independent " Medical Unit for Service in Soviet Russia , " which will leave for Russia with a completely equipped field hospital as soon as enough money has been contributed ( Room 303 , Ito West 4oth St. , New York City ) . The Friends Service Committee have done valiant work , but necessarily on a small scale . Send a check to them at 20 South t zth St. , Philadelphia . The American Relief Administration ( Russian branch , 42 Broadway , New York City ) has assurances of money enough to feed 1,20o,000 children , one balanced ration a day until the next harvest . But not all of these children are in the famine districts . Aside from the millions of undernourished who need to be fed , there are ten millions or more Russians actually starving . Why can not the number of children fed be doubled ? The answer , says Mr. George Barr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be decenter to let them die at once than to carry them for three or four months , bringing them back to physical condition approaching normal , and then abandon them to go back through the stages of slow starvation again . " God forbid that our indifference should continue to make this kind of " decency " necessary . FOR the first time since the armistice an election in one of the victorious countries has resulted in a clear and emphatic triumph for the liberal groups . The powerful coalition which has governed Canada since the issue of conscription split the Liberal party has met with overwhelming defeat and has succeeded in electing only about twenty percent of the members of the new Canadian Parliament . The Liberals will possess a clear majority over both the Conservatives and the Progressives . The majority is not , however , large , and it is doubtful whether the Liberals can form a sufficiently powerful government without Progressive help . The problem of Mackenzie King , the new Prime Minister , will be to satisfy the demands of the economic groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienating the conservative and even reactionary ingredients which that party contains . The Liberal victory is at bottom a victory of agrarianism over industrialism . It is the result of the economic distress of the Canadian farmer , and its endurance will depend upon the ability of his leaders to formulate a program which will relieve the distress of their constituents . Canada is about to be ruled by a group analogous to the agricultural bloc in our own Congress . It remains to be seen whether the ensuing government will be any more " undemocratic and un-American " than that of an industrial bloc . THE New Republic has opened its columns to statements of opinion in regard to Sacco and Vanzetti . It is the view of many competent and trustworthy persons , which we share , that there exists a reasonable doubt of the guilt of these men of the crime with which they are charged . The person nearest the car in which the murderers escaped failed to identify Sacco or Vanzetti among them ; persons less favorably situated on whose identification the state chiefly , depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' psychological perjury ; a strong alibi for the accused was not overthrown , nor was the state able to trace any disposition by Sacco or Vanzetti of the money for which the crime was committed . The New Republic has only the strongest commendation for the New England Civil Liberties Committee which has raised funds for the defence . Surely the committee has acted in accordance with the highest dictates of what we like to call Americanism in coming to the help of these men whose alien origin and radical sympathies were a handicap in their appeal for justice . It is entirely consistent with this attitude to deprecate the demonstrations in foreign countries in behalf of Sacco and Vanzetti , as the New Republic did on November znd . Such demonstrations merely confuse the public mind , arouse national prejudice and shift the issue , which is simply that a reasonable doubt exists as to the guilt of Sacco and Vanzetti . IT is unnecessary to state that neither the New England Civil Liberties Committee nor the New Republic has anything to do with the campaign , undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their behalf in foreign lands . Beyond the obvious damage to the cause of the accused in American opinion , there is the further unfortunate effect of such manifestations in bringing back the attack of class prejudice and popular hysteria which we had reason to hope had passed with Wilson and Palmer . Attorney General Daugherty and Senator Sterling are working to this end . The latter , who is a sort of national edition of Senator Lusk ( we trust the statement is not actionable ) is particularly eager to take advantage of the situation to forward the prospects of the Sterling Anti-Sedition bill . HOW the Sacco-Vanzetti manifestations lend themselves , to perversion by unscrupulous propagandists of reaction appears in Senator Sterling 's talk about " the killing of twenty men by a bomb in a street demonstration , " and his mention of the attempt " to blow up the home sic of Mr. Herrick , Or Ambassador at Paris " in order to reach the con ' elusion that " it might be worth while to further consider sic the bill with a view to broadening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amnesty for political prisoners has undoubtedly cooled off since the armistice , there is no doubt that amnesty remains an unpopular cause . There is no profit to be reaped by espousing it ? and that possibly is why the great New York dailies , with one notable exception , have practically ignored it . The exception is the World , which has followed up a vigorous editorial urging freedom for the politicals by a conspicuous canvassing of that part of public Opinion which favors amnesty . The World 's campaign is a rare example of the independence from considerations of profit , of the clear vision , and of the fearlessness which ' can make journalism responsible . THE riot act has been read to the " agricultural bloc " which a few weeks ago gave a strong proof of its vitality by disobedience in the matter of the surtax . The reader is Secretary Weeks . He dePlores " special legislation , not representing the action of the majority , but forcibly enacted by combinations of divergent interests . " The bloc , he thinks , is a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward a breakdown of party regularity " and responsibility , which might end ? who knows ! ? in the collapse of the Republican Party . One might be puzzled to explain why this ' , warning should have come from Mr. Weeks be- fore the President was heard from , if it were not plain that such a warning will have little effect . The he agricultural bloc can not so easily be frightened . It can , on the contrary , be made to feel More self-conscious of its dangerous power by lust such an admonition as that of Mr. Weeks . 4. v , Ir ? Wickersham , in 1909 , under somewhat sim-'tar circumstances called the progressives to order , with results that , for the Republican regulars , were not happy . LABOR has reason to feel greatly disturbed at the the Lockwood committee has unearthed about e Inside Electrical Workers Union No. 3 . Here in s a union which numbered but 3,800 members whose dues were only $24 a year apiece , while ? 11 ; le fifteen thousand electrical workers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union , were taxed $52 to 13() for " permits " to work . This is not the worst . appears that death benefits were diverted from the relatives to whom they should have been paid ; it appears that the officers of the union were fi-ItZeiallY quite irresponsible . No records of money the in or spent were kept , poor memories took " e Place of accounts , large sums disappeared and 40bod Y could account for them . We believe that ' ases like that of No. 3 are rare . Nevertheless , labor should leave nothing undone to purge its system of such corruptions . Unlike capital , it can not afford them . Rightly or wrongly , the inchoate thing called public opinion has placed the burden of proof upon labor . Labor may see no cause to admit that this feeling is justified , but that is no reason why as a pure matter of strategy it should not act upon this psychological fact , and act vigorously . THE cause of the strike , followed by serious rioting , in the Chicago stockyards is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " company union " which the packers started in competition with the bona-fide Amalgamated Association of Butcher Workmen . For four years , all disputes between the " Big Five " packers and their employees had been arbitrated by Judge Alschuler . In September the unions tried to have this agreement continued , but the packers refused to deal with them , and proceeded to organize a " company union " on a representative plan . This house-broken union accepted a wage reduction which was loudly advertised by the packers as a brilliant example of the success of privately controlled industrial democracy . But when the old union refused to accept the cut , and asked for arbitration , it met with a blank refusal . The strike is the result . It proves once again that the employee " representative " system , with which Mr. Schwab expressed his complete satisfaction some time ago , is usually a fraud . A YEAR ago the chances were that the liquidation of the British Empire would begin with Egypt . The Milner Commission , in spite of the distrust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement with the Egyptian ministry which it appeared might be acceptable . Then the seat of negotiation was transferred to London , Lord Curzon replaced Lord Milner , and the Egyptian delegation rejected the terms . It appears from the Associated Press report that the breaking point was the military occupation of Egypt . The summary of terms as given in the British White Paper indicates that Great Britain agreed to restrict her troops to Port Said and the eastern zone of the Suez canal ; while Alexandria was to become a British naval base with an international police force . On the other hand the Egyptian reply states that by the terms Great Britain reserves " the right to maintain her military force at all times throughout Egypt and to control communications . " The conjecture that the Egyptians are right in their interpretation is given color by the statement of General Allenby 8 6 THE NEW included in the white paper . " Neither the present condition in the world nor the course of events in Egypt since the armistice , " says General Allenby , " permits a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a part of the empire 's communications . " T thus appears that the negotiations broke down on a matter which has been covered by repeated and solemn promises of Great Britain , the evacuation of Egypt . According to General Allenby : " We must insist on effective rights and powers to safeguard both Egypt 's interests and our own until the Egyptian people have shown the capacity themselves to preserve their country from internal dis order and from intervention by foreign powers . " Another promise . But so long as General Allenby and Lord Curzon remain the interpreters of it the time of its fulfilment will be never . General AL . lenby is further reported to the effect that 90,000 troops will be needed to hold Egypt . The financial cost can be calculated in pounds . The moral cost must be estimated in terms of the Denshawi atrocity . Bernard Shaw has given an account of this detestable result of the superior race theory in the preface to John Bull 's Other Island , a great passage of modern English prose , worthy to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of British dealings with subject peoples any more than is Amritsar , but both Denshawi and Amritsar are part of the price which Great Britain pays and will always pay for empire . ONE of the recent and scarcely heralded triumphs of medical science has been the discovery that the hideous scourge of the hook-worm may be removed from the human body by a single application of X-ray treatment . Accounts which reach this office speak of whole tribes in Africa sitting naked in close order while the health giving rays are played over them as from a searchlight , and rising from this baptism with renewed vigor to take up the black man 's burden . Not since St. Francis Xavier received thousands of Japanese into the Church at a single session , has there been such wholesale diffusion of the benefits of Christian civilization among the pagans . We earnestly suggest that the Rockefeller Institute , to which credit for the discovery belongs , should lend its diffusing apparatus to the public schools and especially the colleges . From a close study of symptoms of the hook-worm disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which those called to the intellectual life in- America most commonly suffer . Healing , like charity , should begin at home .
