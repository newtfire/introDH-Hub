As soon as it was shown that the French Senate , by a majority of not far from two to one , was determined to prevent a Ministry of which it disapproved from carrying on the Government , there was nothing for the Ministry to do but to resign . It was paralyzed at once by the refusal of the Senate to give it money to go on with . The contention of the Ministry that it was responsible to ? the two houses jointly , and not to either separately , is thus shown to be entirely academic . If it could be reduced to practice , it would enable a Ministry which retained the con-/ fidence of either chamber to go on in spite of the other . So it is for the public interest that it shall not be reducible to practice . There is no way of taking the sense of the two chambers except by taking the sense of each . But if there were such a way , the Ministry would have been turned out weeks ago . On " joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes , the two chambers would stand , as it has been computed , 401 against the Bourgeois Ministry to 392 in its favor , deducting the votes of the Ministers whose conduct is in question . Adding these votes , the Ministry would enjoy on joint ballot a majority of precisely 1 . Of course such a Ministry can possess no moral authority , unless the slender parliamentary majority in its favor is known to be reinforced and sustained by po- ) ular sentiment . And of this in the present case there is no trustworthy evidence . If the Ministers had been quite sure of " the country , " it may ( *be assumed that they would have appealed to it before this . It does not seem that the appeal can be long delayed . President FAURE seems to be engaged at present in compiling a Ministry which shall be as nearly as possible identical with the Ministry which has ceased to " function , " while yet sufficiently different to rescue it from an immediate displacement by the Senate . Even if he should succeed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a mere makeshift , and that the electoral body must be invoked finally to decide between the two contending parties . ' This ? decision can scarcely be doubtful . M. BOURGEOIS may have a , good deal to say for himself as against his opponents , especially in the matter of the scandals which play so large a part in French politics , and which it- is the object of so large a proportion Of the active politicians to prevent from becoming overt , and to keep in the twilight of gossip and rumor . But whatever he may ha ve to say for himself , it is evident to every Frenchman that he is supported by the Radicals and the Socialists , that he needs their support , and that he must pay for it . This condition is necessarily alarming to the French voters . The mass of French voters are conservative , in the social rather than in the technically political sense , like the mass of American voters . The reason is the same in both cases  --  the general diffusion of property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose . A Socialist ticket , or a ticket mortgaged to the Socialists , can scarcely have a chance of success in such a community .
