" Yours , " he said gravely . " You wo n't last twenty-four hours if you slip your cable . " I picked the bills up . Two five hundreds . I tucked them in my vest . " Right , " I said . " I would n't be a legit any more then , would I ? " " Think that over , dick . " We grinned at each other , a couple of nice lads getting along in a harsh , unfriendly world . Then Red-eyes turned his head sharply . " Okay , Louie . Forget the Mulholland stuff . Pull up . " The car was halfway up a long bleak twist of hill . The rain drove in gray curtains down the slope . There was no ceiling , no horizon . I could see a quarter of a mile and I could see nothing outside our car that lived . The driver edged over to the side of the bank and shut his motoroff . He lit a cigarette and draped an arm on the back seat . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an alligator . " We 'll have a drink on it , " Red-eyes said . " I wish I could make me a grand that easy . Just tyin ' my nose to my chin . " " You ai n't got no chin , " Louie said , and went on smiling . Red-eyes put the Colt down on the seat and drew a flat half-pint out of his side pocket . It looked like good stuff , green stamp , bottled in bond . He unscrewed the top with his teeth , sniffed at the liquor and smacked his lips . " No Crow McGee in this , " he said . " This is the company spread . Tilt her . " He reached along the seat and gave me the bottle . I could have had his wrist , but there was Louie , and I was too far from my ankle . I breathed shallowly from the top of my lungs and held the bottle near my lips , sniffed carefully . Behind the charred smell of the bourbon there was something else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to me in another place . Suddenly and for no reason at all I remembered something Larry Batzel had said , something like : " East of Realito , towards the mountains , near the old cyanide plant . " Cyanide . That was the word . There was a swift tightness in my temples as I put the bottle to my mouth . I could feel my skin crawling , and the air was suddenly cold on it . I held the bottle high up around the liquor level andtook a long gurgling drag at it . Very hearty and relaxing . About 1 half a teaspoonful went into my mouth and none of that stayed there.  |p101I  coughed sharply and lurched forward gagging . Red-eyes laughed . " Do n't say you 're sick from just one drink , pal . " I dropped the bottle and sagged far down in the seat , gagging violently . My legs slid way to the left , the left one underneath . I sprawled down on top of them , my arms limp . I had the gun . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never touched the Colt except to knock it off the seat . The one shot was enough . I heard him lurch . I snapped a shot upward towards where Louie would be . Louie was n't there . He was down behind the front seat . He was silent . The whole car , the whole landscape was silent . Even the rain seemed for a moment to be utterly silent rain . I still did n't have time to look at Red-eyes , but he was n't doing anything . I dropped the Luger and yanked the tommy gun out from under the rug , got my left hand on the front grip , got it set against my shoulder low down . Louie had n't made a sound . " Listen , Louie , " I said softly , " I 've got the stutter gun . How 's about it ? " A shot came through the seat , a shot that Louie knew was n't goingto do any good . It starred a frame of unbreakable glass . There was more silence . Louie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want it ? " " Pull the pin and hold it , " I said . " It will take care of both of us . " " Hell ! " Louie said violently . " Is he croaked ? I ai n't got no pine-apple . " I looked at Red-eyes then . He looked very comfortable in the corner of the seat , leaning back . He seemed to have three eyes , one of them redder even than the other two . For under-arm shootingthat was something to be almost bashful about . It was too good . " Yeah , Louie , he 's croaked , " I said . " How do we get together ? " I could hear his hard breathing now , and the rain had stoppedbeing silent . " Get out of the heap , " he growled . " I 'll blow . " " You get out , Louie. 1 ' 11 blow . " " Jeeze , I ca n't walk home from here , pal . " " You wo n't have to , Louie . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't done nothing . All I done was drive . " " Then reckless driving will be the charge , Louie . You can fixp102that  --  you and your organization . Get out before I uncork this popgun . " A door latch clicked and feet thumped on the running board , then on the roadway . I straightened up suddenly with the chopper . Louie was in the road in the rain , his hands empty and the alligator smile still on his face . I got out past the dead man 's neatly shod feet , got my Colt and the Luger off the floor , laid the heavy twelve-pound tommy gun back on the car floor . I got handcuffs off my hip , motioned to Louie . He turned around sulkily and put his hands behind him . " You got nothing on me , " he complained . " I got protection . " I clicked the cuffs on him and went over him for guns , much more carefully than he had gone over me . He had one besides the one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the car and let him arrange himself on the wet roadway . He began to bleed again , but he was quite dead . Louie eyed him bitterly . " He was a smart guy , " he said . " Different . He liked tricks . Hello , smart guy . " I got my handcuff key out and unlocked one cuff , dragged it down and locked it to the dead man 's lifted wrist . Louie 's eyes got round and horrified and at last his smile went away . " Jeeze , " he whined . " Holy  --  ! Jeeze . You ai n't going to leave me like this , pal ? " " Goodbye , Louie , " I said . " That was a friend of mine you cut down this morning . " " Holy  --  ! " Louie whined . I got into the sedan and started it , drove on to a place where I could turn , drove back clown the hill past him . He stood stiffly as a scorched tree , his face as white as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one linked hand reaching up to Louie 's hand . There was the horror of a thousand nightmares in his eyes . I left him there in the rain . It was getting dark early . I left the sedan a couple of blocks from my own car and locked it up , put the keys in the oil strainer . I walked back to my roadster and drove downtown . I called the homicide detail from a phone booth , asked for a man named Grinnell , told him quickly what had happened and where top103find Louie and the sedan . I told him I thought they were the thugs that machine-gunned Larry Batzel . I did n't tell him anything about Dud O'Mara . " Nice work , " Grinnell said in a queer voice . " But you better come in fast . There 's a tag out for you , account of what some milk driver phoned in an hour ago . " " I 'm all in , " I said . " I 've got to eat . Keep me off the air and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better come in , boy . I 'm sorry , but you better . " " Well , okay , " I said . I hung up and left the neighborhood without hanging around . I had to break it now . I had to , or get broken myself . I had a meal down near the Plaza and started for Realito . AT about eight o'clock two yellow vapor lamps glowed high up in the rain and a dim stencil sign strung across the highway read : " Welcometo Realito . " Frame houses on the main street , a sudden knot of stores , the lights of the corner drugstore behind fogged glass , a flying-cluster of cars in front of a tiny movie palace , and a dark bank on another corner , with a knot of men standing in front of it in the rain . That was Realito . I went on . Empty fields closed in again . This was past the orange country ; nothing but the empty fields and the crouched foothills , and the rain . It was a smart mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and a faint light on it , as if from behind drawn blinds in a house . Just at that moment my left front tire let go with an angry hiss . That was cute . Then the right rear let go the same way . I stopped almost exactly at the intersection . Very cute indeed . I got out , turned my raincoat up a little higher , unshipped a flash , and looked at a flock of heavy galvanized tacks with heads as big as dimes . The flat shiny butt of one of them blinked at me from my tire.  |p104Two  flats and one spare . I tucked my chin down and started towards the faint light up the side road . It was the place all right . The light came from the tilted skylight on the garage roof . Big double doors in front were shut tight , but light showed at the cracks , strong white light . I tossed the beam of the flash up and read : " Art Huck  --  Auto Repairs and Refinishing . " Beyond the garage a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trees . That had light too . I saw a small buttoned-upcoupe in front of the wooden porch . The first thing was the tires , if it could be worked , and they did n't know me . It was a wet night for walking. 1 snapped the flash out and rapped on the doors with it . The light inside went out . I stood there licking rain off my upper lip , the flash in my left hand , my right inside my coat . I had the Luger back under my arm again . A voice spoke through the door , and did n't sound pleased . " What you want ? Who are you ? " " Open up , " I said . " I 've got two flat tires on the highway and only one spare . I need help . " " We 're closed up , mister . Realito 's a mile west of here . " I started to kick the door . There was swearing inside , then another , much softer voice . " A wise guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squealed and half of the door sagged inward . I snapped the flash again and it hit a gaunt face . Then an arm swept and knocked it out of my hand . A gun had just peeked at me from the flailing hand . I dropped low , felt around for the flash and was still . I just did n't pull a gun . " Kill the spot , mister . Guys get hurt that way . " The flash was burning down in the mud . I snapped it off , stood up with it . Light went on inside the garage , outlined a tall man in coveralls . He backed inward and his gun held on me . " Come on in and shut the door . " I did that . " Tacks all over the end of your street , " I said . " I thought you wanted the business . " " Ai n't you got any sense ? A bank job was pulled at Realito this afternoon . " " I 'm a stranger here , " I said , remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain.  | " Okay , okay . Well there was and the punks are hid out somewhere in the hills , they say . You stepped on their tacks , huh ? " " So it seems . " I looked at the other man in the garage . He was short , heavy-set , with a cool brown face and cool brown eyes . He wore a belted raincoat of brown leather . His brown hat had the usual rakish tilt and was dry . His hands were in his pocketsand he looked bored . There was a hot sweetish smell of pyroxylin paint on the air . A big sedan over in the corner had a paint gun lying on its fender . It was a Buick , almost new . It did n't need the paint it was getting . The man in coveralls tucked his gun out of sight through a flap in the side of his clothes . He looked at the brown man . The brown man looked at me and said gently : " Where you from , stranger ? " " Seattle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big city ? " He had a soft voice , soft and dry , like the rustle of well-worn leather . " Yes . How far is it ? " " About forty miles . Seems farther in this weather . Come the long way , did n't you ? By Tahoe and Lone Pine ? " " Not Tahoe , " I said . " Reno and Carson City . " " Still the long way . " A fleeting smile touched the brown lips . " Take a jack and get his flats , Art . " " Now , listen , Lash  --  " the man in the coveralls growled , and stopped as though his throat had been cut from ear to ear . I could have sworn that he shivered . There was dead silence . The brown man did n't move a muscle . Something looked out of his eyes , and then his eyes lowered , almost shyly . His voice was the same soft , dry rustle of sound . " Take two jacks , Art . He 's got two flats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a corner and put a coat on , and a cap . He grabbed up a socket wrench and a handjack and wheeled a dolly jack over to the doors . " Back on the highway , is it ? " he asked me almost tenderly . " Yeah . You can use the spare for one spot , if you 're busy , " I said . " He 's not busy , " the brown man said and looked at his fingernails . Art went out with his tools . The door shut again . I looked at the Buick . I did n't look at Lash Yeager . I knew it was Lash Yeager . There would n't be two men called Lash that came to that garage . I did n't look at him because I would be looking across the sprawledp106body of Larry Batzel , and it would show in my face . For a moment , anyway . He glanced towards the Buick himself . " Just a panel job to start with , " he drawled . " But the guy that owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know the racket . " " Sure , " I said . The minutes passed on tiptoe . Long , sluggish minutes . Then feet crunched outside and the door was pushed open . The light hit pencils of rain and made silver wires of them . Art trundled two muddy flats in sulkily , kicked the door shut , let one of the flats fall on its side . The rain and fresh air had given him his nerve back . He looked at me savagely . " Seattle , " he snarled . " Seattle , my eye ! " The brown man lit a cigarette as if he had n't heard . Art peeled his coat off and yanked my tire up on a rim spreader , tore it loose viciously , had the tube out and cold-patched in nothing flat . He strode scowling over to the wall near me and grabbed an air hose , let enough air into the tube to give it body , and hefted it in both hands to dip it in a washtub of water . I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had looked at the other since Art came back with my tires . Art tossed the air-stiffened tube up casually , caught it with both hands wide , looked it over sourly beside the washtub of water , took one short easy step and slammed it down over my head and shoulders . He jumped behind me in a flash , leaned his weight down on the rubber , dragged it tight against my chest and arms . I could move my hands , but I could n't get near my gun . The brown man brought his right hand out of his pocket and tossed a wrapped cylinder of nickels up and down on his palm as he stepped lithely across the floor . I heaved back hard , then suddenly threw all my weight forward . Just as suddenly Art let go of the tube , and kneed me from behind . I sprawled , but I never knew when I reached the floor . The fist with the weighted tube of nickels met me in mid-flight . Perfectly timed , perfectly weighted , and with my own weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff of dust in a draft.  |p107IT  seemed there was a woman and she was sitting beside a lamp . Light shone on my face , so I shut my eyes again and tried to look at her through my eyelashes . She was so platinumed that her head shone like a silver fruit bowl . She wore a green traveling dress with a mannish cut to it and a broad white collar falling over the lapels . A sharp-angled glossy bag stood at her feet . She was smoking , and a drink was tall and pale at her elbow . I opened my eyes wider and said : " Hello there . " Her eyes were the eyes I remembered , outside Sardi 's in a secondhandRolls-Royce . Very blue eyes , very soft and lovely . Not the eyes of a hustler around the fast money boys . " How do you feel ? " Her voice was soft and lovely too . " Great , " I said . " Except somebody built a filling station on my jaw . " " What did you expect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name . " " You slept well . They had plenty of time to go through your pockets . They did everything but embalm you . " " Right , " I said . I could move a little , not very much . My wrists were behind my back , handcuffed . There was a little poetic justice in that . From the cuffs a cord ran to my ankles , and tied them , and then dropped down out of sight over the end of the davenport and was tied somewhere else . I was almost as helpless as if I had been screwed up in a coffin . " What time is it ? " She looked sideways down at her wrist , beyond the spiral of her cigarette smoke . " Ten-seventeen . Got a date ? " " Is this the house next the garage ? Where are the boys  --  digging a grave ? " " You would n't care , Carmady . They 'll be back . " " Unless you have the key to these bracelets you might spare me a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came over to me , with the tall am/ber glass in her hand . She bent over me . Her breath was delicate . I gulped from the glass craning my neck up . " I hope they do n't hurt you , " she said distantly , stepping back . " I hate killing . " " And you Joe Mesarvey 's wife . Shame on you . Gim me some more of the hooch . " She gave me some more . Blood began to move in my stiffened body . " I kind of like you , " she said . " Even if your face does look like a collision mat . " " Make the most of it , " I said . " It wo n't last long even this good . " She looked around swiftly and seemed to listen . One of the two doors was ajar . She looked towards that . Her face seemed pale . But the sounds were only the rain . She sat down by the lamp again . " Why did you come here and stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the floor . The carpet was made of red and tan squares . There were bright green pine trees on the wallpaper and the curtains were blue . The furniture , what I could see of it , looked as if it came from one of those places that advertise on bus benches . " I had a rose for you , " I said . " From Larry Batzel . " She lifted something off the table and twirled it slowly , the dwarf rose he had left for her . " I got it , " she said quietly . " There was a note , but they did n't show me that . Was it for me ? " " No , for me . He left it on my table before he went out and got shot . " Her face fell apart like something you see in a nightmare . Her mouth and eyes were black hollows . She did n't make a sound . And after a moment her face settled back into the same calmly beautiful lines . " They did n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got shot , " I said carefully , " because he found out what Joe and Lash Yeager did to Dud O'Mara . Bumped him off . " That one did n't faze her at all . " Joe did n't do anything to Dud O'Mara , " she said quietly . " I have n't seen Dud in two years . That was just newspaper hooey , about me seeing him . " " It was n't in the papers , " I said.  | " Well , it was hooey wherever it was . Joe is in Chicago . He went yesterday by plane to sell out . If the deal goes through , Lash and I are to follow him . Joe is no killer . " I stared at her . Her eyes got haunted again . " Is Larry  --  is he  --  ? " " He 's dead , " I said . " It was a professional job , with a tommy gun . I did n't mean they did it personally . " She took hold of her lip and held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her slow , hard breathing . She jammed her cigarette in an ashtray and stood up . " Joe did n't do it ! " she stormed . " I know damn well he did n't . He  --  " She stopped cold , glared at me , touched her hair , then suddenly yanked it off . It was a wig . Underneath her own hair was short like a boy 's , and streaked yellow and whitish brown , with darker tints at the roots . It could n't make her ugly . I managed a sort of laugh . " You just came out here to molt , did n't you , Silver-Wig ? And I thought they were hiding you out  --  so it would look as if you had skipped with Dud O'Mara . " She kept on staring at me . As if she had n't heard a word I said . Then she strode over to a wall mirror and put the wig back on , straightened it , turned and faced me . " Joe did n't kill anybody , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a heel  --  but not that kind of heel . He does n't know anything more about where Dud O'Mara went than I do . And I do n't know anything . " " He just got tired of the rich lady and scrammed , " I said dully . She stood near me now , her white fingers down at her sides , shining in the lamplight . Her head above me was almost in shadow . The rain drummed and my jaw felt large and hot and the nerve along the jawbone ached , ached . " Lash has the only car that was here , " she said softly . " Can you walk to Realito , if I cut the ropes ? " " Sure . Then what ? " " I 've never been mixed up in a murder . I wo n't now . I wo n't ever . " She went out of the room very quickly , and came back with a long kitchen knife and sawed the cord that tied my ankles , pulled it off , cut the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to listen , but it was just the rain again.  |p110I  rolled up to a sitting position and stood up . My feet were numb , but that would pass . I could walk . I could run , if I had to . " Lash has the key of the cuffs , " she said dully . " Let 's go , " I said . " Got a gun ? " " No . I 'm not going . You beat it . He may be back any minute . They were just moving stuff out of the garage . " I went over close to her . " You 're going to stay here after turning me loose ? Wait for that killer ? You 're nuts . Come on , Silver-Wig , you 're going with me . " " No . " " Suppose , " I said , " he did kill O'Mara ? Then he also killed Larry . It 's got to be that way . " " Joe never killed anybody , " she almost snarled at me . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carmady . Just to scare me . Get out . I 'm not afraid of Lash Yeager . I 'm his boss 's wife . " " Joe Mesarvey is a handful of mush , " I snarled back . " The only time a girl like you goes for a wrong gee is when he 's a handful of mush . Let 's drift . " " Get out ! " she said hoarsely . " Okay . " I turned away from her and went through the door . She almost ran past me into the hallway and opened the frontdoor , looked out into the black wetness . She motioned me forward . " Goodbye , " she whispered . " I hope you find Dud . I hope youfind who killed Larry . But it was n't Joe . " I stepped close to her , almost pushed her against the wall with my body . " You 're still crazy , Silver-Wig . Goodbye . " She raised her hands quickly and put them on my face . Cold hands , icy cold . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beat it , strong guy . I 'll be seeing you some more . Maybe in heaven . " I went through the door and down the dark slithery wooden steps of the porch , across gravel to the round grass plot and the clump of thin trees . I came past them to the roadway , went back along it towards Foothill Boulevard . The rain touched my face with fingers of ice that were no colder than her fingers . The curtained roadster stood just where I had left it , leaned over , the left front axle on the tarred shoulder of the highway . My spare and one stripped rim were thrown in the ditch.  |p111They  had probably searched it , but I still hoped . I crawled in backwards and banged my head on the steering post and rolled over to get the manacled hands into my little secret gun pocket . They touched the barrel . It was still there . I got it out , got myself out of the car , got hold of the gun by the right end and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect it a little from the rain and started back towards the house . I wAs halfway there when he came back . His lights turning quickly off the highway almost caught me . I flopped into the ditch and put my nose in the mud and prayed . The car hummed past . I heard the wet rasp of its tires shoulderingthe gravel in front of the house . The motor died and lights went off . The door slammed . I did n't hear the house door shut , but I caught a feeble fringe of light through the trees as it opened . I got up on my feet and went on . I came up beside the car , a small coupe , rather old . The gun was down at my side , pulled around my hip as far as the cuffs would let it come . The coupe was empty . Water gurgled in the radiator . I listened and heard nothing from the house . No loud voices , no quarrel . Only the heavy bong-bong-bong of the raindrops hitting the elbows at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . She had let me go and Yeager was in there with her . Probably she would n't tell him anything . She would just stand and look at him . She was his boss 's wife . That would scare Yeager to death . He would n't stay long , but he would n't leave her behind , alive or dead . He would be on his way and take her with him . What happened to her later on was something else . All I had to do was wait for him to come out . I did n't do it . I shifted the gun into my left hand and leaned down to scoop up some gravel . I threw it against the front window . It was a weak effort . Very little even reached the glass.  |p112I  ran back behind the coupe and got its door open and saw the keys in the ignition lock . I crouched down on the running board , holding on to the door post . The house had already gone dark , but that was all . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too cagy . I reached it with my foot and found the starter , then strained back with one hand and turned the ignition key . The warm motorcaught at once , throbbed gently against the pounding rain . I got back to the ground and slid along to the rear of the car , crouched down . The sound of the motor got him . He could n't be left there without a car . A darkened window slid up an inch , only some shifting of light on the glass showing it moved . Flame spouted from it , the racket of three quick shots . Glass broke in the coupe . I screamed and let the scream die into a gurgling groan . I was getting good at that sort of thing . I let the groan die in a choked gasp . I was through , finished . He had got me . Nice shooting , Yeager . Inside the house a man laughed . Then silence again , except for the rain and the quietly throbbing motor of the coupe . Then the house door inched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the porch , stiffly , the white showing at her collar , the wig showing a little but not so much . She came down the steps like a wooden woman . I saw Yeager crouched behind her . She started across the gravel . Her voice said slowly , without any tone at all : " I ca n't see a thing , Lash . The windows are all misted . " She jerked a little , as if a gun had prodded her , and came on . Yeager did n't speak . I could see him now past her shoulder , his hat , part of his face . But no kind of a shot for a man with cuffs on his wrists . She stopped again , and her voice was suddenly horrified . " He 's behind the wheel ! " she yelled . " Slumped over ! " He fell for it . He knocked her to one side and started to blast again . More glass jumped around . A bullet hit a tree on my side of the car . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was low , crouched against the black , his face a grayness withoutform that seemed to come back very slowly after the glare ofp113the shots . His own fire had blinded him too  --  for a second . That was enough . I shot him four times , straining the pulsing Colt against my ribs . He tried to turn and the gun slipped away from his hand . He half snatched for it in the air , before both his hands suddenly went against his stomach and stayed there . He sat down on the wet gravel and his harsh panting dominated every other sound of the wet night . I watched him lie down on his side , very slowly , without taking his hands away from his stomach . The panting stopped . It seemed like an age before Silver-Wig called out to me . Then she was beside me , grabbing my arm . " Shut the motor off ! " I yelled at her . " And get the key of these damn irons out of his pocket . " " You d-darn fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for ? " CAPTAIN AL RooF of the Missing Persons Bureau swung in his chair and looked at the sunny window . This was another day , and the rain had stopped long since . He said gruffly : " You 're making a lot of mistakes , brother . Dud O'Mara just pulled down the curtain . None of those people knocked him off . The Batzel killing had nothing to do with it . ' They 've got Mesarvey in Chicago and he looks clean . The Heeb you anchored to the dead guy do n't even know who they were pulling the job for . Our boys asked him enough to be sure of that . " " I 'll bet they did , " I said . " I 've been in the same bucket all night and I could n't tell them much either . " He looked at me slowly , with large , bleak , tired eyes . " Killing Yeager was all right , I guess . And the chopper . In the circumstances . Besides I 'm not homicide . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . " I could , but I had n't . Not yet .

" " I wondered why you did n't find the girl , at Realito . It could n't have been very hard  --  for you . " " We just did n't . We should have . I admit it . We did n't . Anythingelse ? " I blew smoke across his desk . " I 'm looking for O'Mara because the general told me to . It was n't any use my telling him you would do everything that could he done . He could afford a man with all his time on it . I suppose you resent that . " He was n't amused . " Not at all , if he wants to waste money . The people that resent you are behind a door marked Homicide Bu-reau . " He planted his feet with a slap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his clothes . That 's a lot of jack but O'Mara would be the boy to have it . So he could take it out and have his old pals see him with it . Only they would n't think it was fifteen grand of real dough . His wife says it was . Now with any other guy but an ex-legger in the gravy that might indicate an intention to disappear . But not O'Mara . He packed it all the time . " He bit a cigar and put a match to it . He waved a large finger . " See ? " I said I saw . " Okay . O'Mara had fifteen grand , and a guy that pulls down the curtain can keep it down only so long as his wad lasts . Fifteen grand is a good wad . I might disappear myself , if I had that much .

" " No , they would n't , " I said . " He went far , " Roof said . " But the fifteen grand was all the preparation he made . No baggage , no boat or rail or plane reservation , no taxi or private rental hack to a point out of town . That 's all checked . His own car was found a dozen blocks from where hep115lived . But that means nothing . He knew people who would ferry him several hundred miles and keep quiet about it , even in the face of a reward . Here , but not everywhere . Not new friends . " " But you 'll get him , " I said . " When he gets hungry . " " That could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live a year . That is a matter of sentiment , not whether you have an open file when you retire . " " You attend to the sentiment , brother . " His eyes moved and bushy reddish eyebrows moved with them . He did n't like me . Nobodydid , in the police department , that day . " I 'd like to , " I said and stood up . " Maybe I 'd go pretty far to attend to that sentiment . " " Sure , " Roof said , suddenly thoughtful . " Well , Winslow is a big man . Anything I can do let me know . " " You could find out who had Larry Batzel gunned , " I said . " Even if there is n't any connection . " " We 'll do that . Glad to , " he guffawed and flicked ash all over his desk . " You just knock off the guys who can talk and we 'll do the rest . We like to work that way . " " It was self-defense , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . Take the air , brother . I 'm busy . " But his large bleak eyes twinkled at me as I went out . THE morning was all blue and gold and the birds in the ornamental trees of the Winslow estate were crazy with song after the rain . The gatekeeper let me in through the postern and I walked up the driveway and along the top terrace to the huge carved Italian front door . Before I rang the bell I looked clown the hill and saw the Trevillyan kid sitting on his stone bench with his head cupped in his hands , staring at nothing . I went down the brick path to him . " No darts today , son ? " He looked up at me with his lean , slaty , sunken eyes.  | " No . Did you find him ? " " Your dad ? No , sonny , not yet . " He jerked his head . His nostrils flared angrily . " He 's not my dad I told you . And do n't talk to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's  --  he 's in Florida or somewhere . " " Well , I have n't found him yet , whoever 's dad he is , " I said . " Who smacked your jaw ? " he asked , staring at me . " Oh , a fellow with a roll of nickels in his hand . " " Nickels ? " " Yeah . That 's as good as brass knuckles . Try it sometime , but not on me . " I grinned . " You wo n't find him , " he said bitterly , staring at my jaw . " Him , I mean . My mother 's husband . " " I bet I do . " " How much you bet ? " " More money than even you 've got in your pants . " He kicked viciously at the edge of a red brick in the walk . Hisvoice was still sulky , but more smooth . His eyes speculated . " Want to bet on something else ? C'm on over to the range . I betyou a dollar I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I looked back towards the house . Nobody seemed impatient toreceive me . " Well , " I said , " we 'll have to make it snappy . Let 's go . " We went along the side of the house under the windows . The orchid green-house showed over the tops of some bushy trees far back . A man in neat whipcord was polishing the chromium on a big car in front of the garages . We went past there to the low white building against the bank . The boy took a key out and unlocked the door and we went into close air that still held traces of cordite fumes . The boy clicked a spring lock on the door . " Me first , " he snapped . The place looked something like a small beach shooting gallery . There was a counter with a .22 repeating rifle on it and a long , slim target pistol . Both well oiled but dusty . About thirty feet beyond the counter was a waist-high , solid-looking partition across the building , and behind that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white targets marked off with black rings and stained by lead bullets.  |p117The  clay pipes ran in an even line across the middle , and there was a big skylight , and a row of hooded overhead lights . The boy pulled a cord on the wall and a thick canvas blind slid across the skylight . He turned on the hooded lights and then the place really looked like a beach shooting gallery . He picked up the .22 rifle and loaded it quickly from a cardboard box of shells , .22 shorts . " A dollar I get eight out of ten pipes ? " " Blast away , " I said , and put my money on the counter . He took aim almost casually , fired too fast , showing off . He missed three pipes . It was pretty fancy shooting at that . He threw the rifle down on the counter . " Gee , go set up some more . Let 's not count that one . I was n't set . " " You do n't aim to lose any money , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's your range . " His narrow face got angry and his voice got shrill . " You do it ! I 've got to relax , see . I 've got to relax . " I shrugged at him , lifted a flap in the counter and went along the whitewashed side wall , squeezed past the end of the low partition . The boy clicked his reloaded rifle shut behind me . " Put that down , " I growled back at him . " Never touch a gun when there 's anyone in front of you . " He put it down , looking hurt . I bent down and grabbed a handful of clay pipes out of the sawdustin a big wooden box on the floor . I shook the yellow grains of wood off them and started to straighten up . I stopped with my hat above the barrier , just the top of my hat . I never knew why I stopped . Blind instinct . The .22 cracked and the lead bullet bonged into the target in front of my head . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackbird had swooped at it during the nesting season . A nice kid . He was full of tricks , like Red-eyes . I dropped the pipes and took hold of my hat by the brim , lifted it straight up off my head a few inches . The gun cracked again . Another metallic bong on the target . I let myself fall heavily to the wooden flooring , among the pipes . A door opened and shut . That was all . Nothing else . The hardglare from the hooded lights beat down on me . The sun peeked inp118at the edges of the skylight blind . There were two bright new splashes on the nearest target , and there were four small round holes in my hat , two and two , on each side . I crawled to the end of the barrier and peeked around it . The boy was gone . I could see the small muzzles of the two guns on the counter . I stood up and went back along the wall , switched the lights off , turned the knob of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his polish job around in front of the garages . I crushed my hat in my hand and went back along the side of the house , looking for the kid . I did n't see him . I rang the front door bell . I asked for Mrs. O'Mara . I did n't let the butler take my hat . SHE was in an oyster-white something , with white fur at the cuffs and collar and around the bottom . A breakfast table on wheels was pushed to one side of her chair and she was flicking ashes among the silver . The coy-looking maid with the nice legs came and took the table out and shut the tall white door . I sat down . Mrs. O'Mara leaned her head back against a cushion and looked tired . The line of her throat was distant , cold . She stared at me with a cool , hard look , in which there was plenty of dislike . " You seemed rather human yesterday , " she said . " But I see you are just a brute like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I came to ask you about Lash Yeager , " I said . She did n't even pretend to be amused . " And why should you think of asking me ? " " Well  --  if you lived a week at the Dardanella Club  --  " I waved my crunched-together hat . She looked at her cigarette fixedly . " Well , I did meet him , I believe . I remember the rather unusual name . " " They all have names like that , those animals , " I said . " It seemsp119that Larry Batzel  --  I guess you read in your paper about him too  --  was a friend of Dud O'Mara 's once . I did n't tell you about him yesterday . Maybe that was a mistake . " A pulse began to throb in her throat . She said softly : " I have a suspicion you are about to become very insolent , that I may even have to have you thrown out . " " Not before I 've said my piece , " I said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unusual names , those animals  --  told Larry Batzel that Mr. Yeager was out this way the night O'Mara disappeared . " The old army blood had to be good for something in her . She did n't move a muscle . She just froze solid . I got up and took the cigarette from between her frozen fingers and killed it in a white jade ashtray . I laid my hat carefully on her white satin knee . I sat down again . Her eyes moved after a while . They moved down and looked at the hat . Her face flushed very slowly , in two vivid patches over the cheekbones . She fought around with her tongue and lips . " I know , " I said . " It 's not much of a hat . I 'm not making you a present of it . But just look at the bullet holes in it once . " Her hand became alive and snatched at the hat . Her eyes became flames . She spread the crown out , looked at the holes , and shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a wisp of a voice , an old voice . I said very slowly : " Yeager would n't use a .22 target rifle , Mrs. O'Mara . " The flame died in her eyes . They were pools of darkness , much emptier than darkness . " You 're his mother , " I said . " What do you want to do about it ? " " Merciful God ! Dade ! He . . . shot at y nu ! " " Twice , " I said . " But why ? . . . Oh , why ? " " You think I 'm a wise guy , Mrs. O'Mara . Just another hardeyedboy from the other side of the tracks . It would be easy in this spot , if I was . But I 'm not that at all , really . Do I have to tell why he shot at me ! " She did n't speak . She nodded slowly . Her face was a mask now.  | " I 'd say he probably ca n't help it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his stepfather , for one thing . Then he 's a little lad that likes money . That seems small , but it 's part of the picture . He almost lost a dollar to me on his shooting . It seems small , but he lives in a small world . Most of all , of course , he 's a crazy little sadist with an itchy trigger finger . " " How dare you ! " she flared . It did n't mean anything . She forgotit herself instantly . " How dare I ? I do dare . Let 's not bother figuring why he shot at me . I 'm not the first , am I ? You would n't have known what I was talking about , you would n't have assumed he did it on pur-pose . " She did n't move or speak . I took a deep breath . " So let 's talk about why he shot Dud O'Mara , " I said . If I thought she would yell even this time , I fooled myself . The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tallnessand her dark hair and her reckless eyes . She pulled her lips back and tried to lick them , and it made her look like a scared little girl , for a second . The lines of her cheeks sharpened and her hand went up like an artificial hand moved by wires and took hold of the white fur at her throat and pulled it tight and squeezed it until her knuckles looked like bleached bone . Then she just stared at me . Then my hat slid off her knee on to the floor , without her moving . The sound it made falling was one of the loudest sounds I had ever heard . " Money , " she said in a dry croak . " Of course you want money . " " How much money do I want ? " " Fifteen thousand dollars . " I nodded , stiff-necked as a floorwalker trying to see with his back . " That would be about right . That would be the established retainer . That would be about what he had in his pockets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're too  --  damned smart , " she said horribly . " I could kill you myself and like it . " I tried to grin . " That 's right . Smart and without a feeling in the world . It happened something like this . The boy got O'Marap121where he got me , by the same simple ruse . I do n't think it was a plan . He hated his stepfather , but he would n't exactly plan to kill him . " " He hated him , " she said . " So they 're in the little shooting gallery and O'Mara is dead on the floor , behind the barrier , out of sight . The shots , of course , meant nothing there . And very little blood , with a head shot , small caliber . So the boy goes out and locks the door and hides . But after a while he has to tell somebody . He has to . He tells you . You 're his mother . You 're the one to tell . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her eyes had stopped hating me . " You think about calling it an accident , which is okay , except for one thing . The boy 's not a normal boy , and you know it . The general knows it , the servants know . There must be other people that know it . And the law , dumb as you think they are , are pretty smart with subnormal types . They get to handle so many of them . And I think he would have talked . I think , after a while , he would even have bragged . " " Go on , " she said . " You would n't risk that , " I said . " Not for your son and not for the sick old man in the orchid house . You 'd do any awful criminal callous thing rather than risk that . You did it . You knew Yeager and you hired him to get rid of the body . That 's all  --  except that hiding the girl , Mona Mesarvey , helped to make it look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dark , in Dud 's own car , " she said hollowly . I reached down and picked my hat off the floor . " How about the servants ? " " Norris knows . The butler . He 'd die on the rack before he told . " " Yeah . Now you know why Larry Batzel was knocked off and why I was taken for a ride , do n't you ? " " Blackmail , " she said . " It had n't come yet , but I was waiting for it . I would have paid anything , and he would know that . " " Bit by bit , year by year , there was a quarter of a million in it for him , easy . I do n't think Joe Mesarvey was in it at all . I know the girl wasn't. "  |p122She  did n't say anything . She just kept her eyes on my face . " Why in hell , " I groaned , " did n't you take the guns away from him ? " " He 's worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm  --  I 'm almost afraid of him myself . " " Take him away , " I said . " From here . From the old man . He 's young enough to be cured , by the right handling . Take him to Europe . Far away . Take him now . It would kill the general out of hand to know his blood was in that . " She got up draggingly and dragged herself across to the windows . She stood motionless , almost blending into the heavy white drapes . Her hands hung at her sides , very motionless also . After a while she turned and walked past me . When she was behind me she caught her breath and sobbed just once . " It was very vile . It was the vilest thing I ever heard of . Yet 1 would do it again . Father would not have done it . He would have spoken right out . It would , as you say , have killed him . " " Take him away , " I pounded on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got me . He 's hiding somewhere like an animal . Get him . He ca n't help it . " " I offered you money , " she said , still behind me . " That 's nasty . I was n't in love with Dudley O'Mara . That 's nasty too . I ca n't thank you . I do n't know what to say . " " Forget it , " I said . " I 'm just an old workhorse . Put your work on the boy . " " I promise . Goodbye , Mr. Carmady . " We did n't shake hands . I went back down the stairs and the butlerwas at the front door as usual . Nothing in his face but politeness . " You will not want to see the general today , sir ? " " Not today , Norris . " I did n't see the boy outside . I went through the postern and got into my rented Ford and drove on down the hill , past where the old oil wells were . Around some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sumps in which waste water lay and festered with a scum of oil on top . They would be ten or twelve feet deep , maybe more . There would be dark things in them . Perhaps in one of them  --  I was glad I had killed Yeager.  |p123On  the way back downtown I stopped at a bar and had a couple of drinks . They did n't do me any good . All they did was make me think of Silver-Wig , and I never saw her again.  |p127THE  big guy was n't any of my business . He never was , then or later , least of all then . I was over on Central , which is the Harlem of Los Angeles , on one of the " mixed " blocks , where there were still both white and colored establishments . I was looking for a little Greek barber named Torn Aleidis whose wife wanted him to come home and was willing to spend a little money to find him . It was a peaceful job . Tom Aleidis was not a crook . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an all-colored drink and dice second-floor , not too savory . He was looking up at the broken stencils in the electric sign , with a sort of rapt expression , like a hunky immigrant looking at the Statue of Liberty , like a man who had waited a long time and come a long way . He was n't just big . He was a giant . He looked seven feet high , and he wore the loudest clothes I ever saw on a really big man . Pleated maroon pants , a rough grayish coat with white billiard balls for buttons , brown suede shoes with explosions in white kid on them , a brown shirt , a yellow tie , a large red carnation , and a front-door handkerchief the color of the Irish flag . It was neatly arranged in three points , under the red carnation . On Central Avenue , not the quietest dressed street in the world , with that size and that make-up he looked about as unobtrusive as a tarantula on a slice of angel food . He went over and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop swinging before they exploded outward again . What sailed out and landed in the gutter and made a high ; keening noise , like a wounded rat , was a slick-haired colored youth in a pinchback suit . A " brown , " the color of coffee with rather thin cream in it . His face , I mean . It still was n't any of my business . I watched the colored boy creepp128away along the walls . Nothing more happened . So I made my mistake . I moved along the sidewalk until I could push the swing door myself . Just enough to look in . Just too much . A hand I could have sat in took hold of my shoulder and hurt and lifted me through the doors and up three steps . A deep , soft voice said in my ear easily , " Smokes in here , pal . Can you tie that ? " I tried for a little elbow room to get to my sap . I was n't wearing a gun . The little Greek barber business had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of my shoulder again . " It 's that kind of place , " I said quickly . " Do n't say that , pal . Beulah used to work here . Little Beulah . " " Go on up and see for yourself . " He lifted me up three more steps . " I 'm feeling good , " he said . " I would n't want anybody to bother me . Let 's you and me go on up and maybe nibble a drink . " " They wo n't serve you , " I said . " I ai n't seen Beulah in eight years , pal , " he said softly , tearing my shoulder to pieces without noticing what he was doing . " She ai n't even wrote in six . But she 'll have a reason . She used to work here . Let 's you and me go on up . " " All right , " I said . " I 'll go up with you . Just let me walk . Do n't carry me . I 'm fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I go to the bathroom alone and everythi ul Just do n't carry me . " " Little Beulah used to work here , " he said softly . He was n't listening to me . We went on up . He let me walk . A crap table was in the far corner beyond the bar , and scattered tables and a few customers were here and there . The whiny voices chanting around the crap table stopped instantly . Eyes looked at us in that dead , alien silence of another race . A large Negro was leaning against the bar in shirt-sleeves with pink garters on his arms . An ex-pug who had been hit by everything but a concrete bridge . He pried himself loose from the bar edge and came towards us in a loose fighter 's crouch . He put a large brown hand against the big man 's gaudy chest . It looked like a stud there.  | " No white folks , brother . Jes ' fo ' the colored people . I'se sorry . " " Where 's Beulah ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his big white face and his depthless black eyes . The Negro did n't quite laugh . " No Beulah , brother . No hooch , no gals , jes ' the scram , brother . Jes ' the scram . " " Kind of take your goddam mitt off me , " the big man said . The bouncer made a mistake , too . He hit him . I saw his shoulder drop , his body swing behind the punch . It was a good clean punch . The big man did n't even try to block it . He shook his head and took hold of the bouncer by the throat . He was quick for his size . The bouncer tried to knee him . The big man turned him and bent him , took hold of the back of his belt . That broke . So the big man just put his huge hand flat against the bouncer 's spine and threw him , clear across the narrow room . The bouncer hit the wall on the far side with a crash that must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall and lay there , motionless . " Yeah , " the big man said . " Let 's you and me nibble one . " We went over to the bar . The barman swabbed the bar hurriedly . The customers , by ones and twos and threes , drifted out , silent across the bare floor , silent down the dim uncarpeted stairs . Their departing feet scarcely rustled . " Whisky sour , " the big man said . We had whisky sours . " You know where Beulah is ? " the big man asked the barman impassively , licking his whisky sour down the side of the thick glass . " Beulah , you says ? " the barman whined . " I ai n't seen her roun ' heah lately . Not right lately , no suh . " " How long you been here ? " " ' Bout a yeah , Ah reckon . ' Bout a yeah . Yes suh . ' Bout  --  " " How long 's this coop been a dinge box ? " " Says which ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , about the size of a bucket . " Five years anyway , " I put in . " This fellow would n't know anything about a white girl named Beulah . " The big man looked at me as if 1 had just hatched out . His whisky sour did n't seem to improve his temper . " Who the hell asked you to stick your face in ? "  |p130I  smiled . I made it a big , friendly smile . " I 'm the fellow came in here with you . Remember ? " He grinned back , a flat , white grin . " Whisky sour , " he told the barman . " Get them fleas outa your pants . Service . " The barman scuttled around , hating us with the whites of his eyes . The place was empty now , except for the two of us and the barman , and the bouncer over against the far wall . The bouncer groaned and stirred . He rolled over and began to crawl softly along the baseboard , like a fly with one wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There ai n't nothing left of the joint , " he complained . " They was a stage and a band and cute little rooms where you could have fun . Beulah did some warbling . A redhead . Awful cute . We was to of been married when they hung the frame on me . " We had two more whisky sours before us now . " What frame ? " I asked . " Where you figure I been them eight years I told you about ? " " In somebody 's Stony Lonesome , " I said . " Right . " He prodded his chest with a thumb like a baseball bat . " Steve Skalla . The Great Bend job in Kansas . Just me . Forty grand . They caught up with me right here . I was what that  --  hey ! " The bouncer had made a door at the back and fallen through it . A lock clicked . " Where 's that door lead to ? " the big man demanded . " Tha  --  tha 's Mistah Montgom'ry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got his office back  --  " " He might know , " the big man said . He wiped his mouth on the Irish flag handkerchief and arranged it carefully back in his pocket . " He better not crack wise neither . Two more whisky sours . " He crossed the room to the door behind the crap table . The lock gave him a little argument for a moment , then a piece of the panel dropped off and he went through , shut the door after him . It was very silent in Shamey 's now . I looked at the barman . " This guy 's tough , " I said quickly . " And he 's liable to go mean . You can see the idea . He 's looking for an old sweetie who used to work here when it was a place for whites . Got any artillery back there ? " " I thought you was with him , " the barman said suspiciously.  | " Could n't help myself . He dragged me up . I did n't feel like being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me a shotgun , " the barman said , still suspicious . He began to stoop behind the bar , then stayed in that position rolling his eyes . There was a dull flat sound at the back of the place , behind the shut door . It might have been a slammed door . It might have been a gun . Just the one sound . No other followed it . The barman and I waited too long , wondering what the sound was . Not liking to think what it could be . The door at the back opened and the big man came through quickly , with a Colt army .45 automatic looking like a toy in his hand . He looked the room over with one swift glance . His grin was taut . He looked like the man who could take forty grand singlehandedfrom the Great Bend Bank . IIe came over to us in swift , almost soundless steps , for all his size . " Rise up , nigger ! " The barman came up slowly , gray ; his hands empty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from us . " Mr. Montgomery did n't know where Beulah was either , " he said softly . " He tried to tell me  --  with this . " He waggled the gun . " So long , punks . Do n't forget your rubbers . " He was gone , down the stairs , very quickly , very quietly . I jumped around the bar and took the sawed-off shotgun that lay there , on the shelf . Not to use on Steve Skalla . That was not my job . So the barman would n't use it on me . I went back across the room and through that door . The bouncer lay on the floor of a hail with a knife in his hand . He was unconscious . I took the knife out of his hand and stepped over him through a door marked Office . Mr. Montgomery was in there , behind a small scarred desk , close to a partly boarded-up window . Just folded , like a handkerchief or a hinge . A drawer was open at his right hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smear of oil on the paper that lined it . Not a smart idea , but he would never have a smarter one  --  not now . Nothing happened while I waited for the police.  |p132When  they came both the barman and the bouncer were gone . I had locked myself in with Mr. Montgomery and the shotgun . Just in case . Hiney got it . A lean-jawed , complaining , overslow detective lieutenant , with long yellow hands that he held on his knees while he talked to me in his cubicle at Headquarters . His shirt was darned under the points of his old-fashioned stiff collar . He looked poor and sour and honest . This was an hour or so later . They knew all about Steve Skalla then , from their own records . They even had a ten-year-old photo that made him look as eyebrowless as a French roll . All they did n't know was where he was . " Six foot six and a half , " Hiney said . " Two hundred sixty-four pounds . A guy that size ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't buy anything else in a hurry . Why n't you take him ? " I handed the photo back and laughed . Hiney pointed one of his long yellow fingers at me bitterly . " Carmady , a tough shamus , huh ? Six feet of man , and a jaw you could break rocks on . Why n't you take him ? " " I 'm getting a little gray at the temples , " I said . " And I did n't have a gun . He had . I was n't on a gun-toting job over there . Skalla just picked me up . I 'm kind of cute sometimes . " Riney glared at me . " All right , " I said . " Why argue ? I 've seen the guy . He could wear an elephant in his vest pocket . And I did n't know he 'd killed anybody . You 'll get him all right . " " Yeah , " Hiney said . " Easy . But I just do n't like to waste my time on these shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three lines in the want-ad section . Heck , they was five smokes  --  five , mind you  --  carved Harlem sunsets all over each other over on East Eight-four one time . All dead . Cold meat . And the newshawks would n't even go out there . " " Pick him up nice , " I said . " Or he 'll knock off a brace of prowlies for you . Then you 'll get space . " " And I would n't have the case then neither , " Hiney jeered . " Well , the hell with him . I got him on the air . Ai n't nothing else to do but just sit . " " Try the girl , " I said . " Beulah . Skalla will . That 's what he 's after . That 's what started it all . Try her . "  | " You try her , " Hiney said . " I ai n't been in a joy house in twenty years . " " I suppose I 'd be right at home in one . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coppers do n't hire private dicks . What with ? " He rolled a cigarette out of a can of tobacco . It burned down one side like a forest fire . A man yelled angrily into a telephone in the next cubbyhole . Hiney made another cigarette with more care and licked it and lighted it . He clasped his bony hands on his bony knees again . " Think of your publicity , " I said . " I bet you twenty-five I find Beulah before you put Skalla under glass . " He thought it over . He seemed almost to count his bank balance on his cigarette puffs . " Ten is top , " he said . " And she 's all mine  --  private . " I stared at him . " I do n't work for that kind of money , " I said . " But if I can do it in one day  --  and you let me alone  --  I 'll do it for nothing . Just to show you why you 've been a lieutenant for twenty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked his about the joy house . But we shook hands on it . I got my old Chrysler roadster out of the official parking lot and drove back towards the Central Avenue district . Shamey 's was closed up , of course . An obvious plainclothes man sat in a car in front of it , reading a paper with one eye . I did n't know why . Nobody there knew anything about Skalla . I parked around the corner and went into the diagonal lobby of a Negro hotel called the Hotel Sans Souci . Two rows of hard , empty chairs stared at each other across a strip of fiber carpet . Behind a desk a bald-headed man had his eyes shut and his hands clasped on the desk top . He dozed . He wore an ascot tie that had been tied about 188o , and the green stone in his stickpin was not quite as large as a trash barrel . His large , loose chin folded down on it gently , and his brown hands were soft , peaceful , and clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel Is Under the Protection of the International Consolidated Agencies , Inc . When he opened one eye I pointed to the sign and said : " H.P.D. man checking up . Any trouble here ? " H.P.D. means Hotel Protective Department , which is the part of a large agency that looks after check bouncers and people who movep134out by the back stairs , leaving secondhand suitcases full of bricks . " Trouble , brother , " he said , in a high , sonorous voice , " is somethingwe is fresh out of . " He lowered the voice four or five notches and added , " We do n't take no checks . " I leaned on the counter across from his folded hands and started to spin a quarter on the bare , scarred wood . " Heard what happened over at Shamey 's this morning ? " " Brother , I forgit . " Both his eyes were open now and he was watching the blur of light made by the spinning quarter . " The boss got bumped off , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lawd receive his soul , brother . " The voice went down again . " Cop ? " " Private  --  on a confidential lay . And I know a man who can keep one that way when I see one . " He looked me over , closed his eyes again . I kept spinning the quarter . He could n't resist looking at it . " Who done it ? " he asked softly . " Who fixed Sam ? " " A tough guy out of the jailhouse got sore because it was n't a white joint . It used to be . Remember ? " He did n't say anything . The coin fell over with a light whirr and lay still . " Call your play , " I said . " I 'll read you a chapter of the Bible or buy you a drink . Either one . " " Brother , " he said sonorously , " I kinda like to read my Bible in the seclusion of my family . " Then he added swiftly , in his business voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I went around there and pulled a pint of bonded bourbon off my hip and handed it to him in the shelter of the desk . He poured two small glasses , quickly , sniffed his with a smooth , expert manner , and tucked it away . " What you want to know ? " he asked . " Ai n't a crack in the sidewalkI do n't know . Mebbe I ai n't tellin ' though . This liquor 's been in the right company . " " Who ran Shamey 's before it was a colored place ? " He stared at me , surprised . " That name of that pore sinner was Shamey , brother . " I groaned . " What have I been using for brains ? " " He 's daid , brother , gathered to the Lawd . Died in nineteen andp135twenty-nine . A wood alcohol case , brother . And him in the business . " He raised his voice to the sonorous level . " The same year the rich folks lost their goods and chattels , brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lose me a nickel . " " I 'll bet you did n't . Pour some more . He leave any folks  --  anybodythat 's still around ? " He poured another small drink , corked the bottle firmly . " Two is all  --  before lunch , " he said . " I thank you , brother . Yo ' method of approach is soothin ' to a man 's dignity . " He cleared his throat . " Had a wife , " he said . " Try the phone book . " He would n't take the bottle . I put it back on my hip . He shook hands with me , folded his on the desk once more and closed his eyes . The incident , for him , was over . There was only one Shamey in the phone book . Violet Lu Shamey , 1644 West Fifty-fourth Place . I spent a nickel in a booth . After a long time a dopey voice said , " Uh-huh . Wh-what is it ? " " Are you the Mrs. Shamey whose husband once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment ? " " Wha  --  what ? My goodness sakes alive ! My husband 's been gone these seven years . Who did you say you was ? " " Detective Carmady . I 'll be right out . It 's important . " " Wh-who did you say  --  " It was a thick , heavy , clogged voice . It was a dirty brown house with a dirty brown lawn in front of it . There was a large bare patch around a tough-looking palm tree . On the porch stood one lonely rocker . The afternoon breeze made the unpruned shoots of last year 's poinsettias tap-tap against the front wall . A line of stiff , yellowish , half-washed clothes jittered on a rusty wire in the side yard . I drove on a little way and parked my roadster across the street , and walked back . The bell did n't work , so I knocked . A woman opened the door blowing her nose . A long yellow face with weedy hair growing down the sides of it . Her body was shapeless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just something around her . Her toes were large and obvious in a pair of broken man 's slippers . I said , " Mrs. Shamey ? " " You the  --  ? "  | " Yeah . I just called you . " She gestured me in wearily . " I ai n't had time to get cleaned up yet , " she whined . We sat down in a couple of dingy mission rockers and looked at each other across a living room in which everything was junk except a small new radio droning away behind its dimly lighted panel . " All the company I got , " she said . Then she tittered . " Bert ai n't done nothing , has he ? I do n't get cops calling on me much . " " Bert ? " " Bert Shamey , mister , My husband . " She tittered again and flopped her feet up and down . In her titter was a loose alcoholic overtone . It seemed I was not to get away from it that day . " A joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope to Christ there 's enough cheap blondes where he is . He never got enough of them here . " " I was thinking more about a redhead , " I said . " I guess he 'd use one of those too . " Her eyes , it seemed to me , were not so loose now . " I do n't call to mind . Any special one ? " " Yeah . A girl named Beulah . I do n't know her last name . She worked at the Club on Central . I 'm trying to trace her for her folks . It 's a colored place now and , of course , the people there never heard of her . " " I never went there , " the woman yelled , with unexpected violence . " I would n't know . " " An entertainer , " I said . " A singer . No chance you 'd know her , eh ? " She blew her nose again , on one of the dirtiest handkerchiefs I ever saw . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for it , " I said . She gave me a swift , raking glance . " I 'm fresh out of that . " " I 'm not . " " Gawd , " she said . " You 're no cop . No cop ever bought a drink . " I brought out my pint of bourbon and balanced it on my knee . It was almost full still . The clerk at the Hotel Sans Souci was no reservoir . The woman 's seaweed-colored eyes jumped at the bottle . Her tongue coiled around her lips . " Man , that 's liquor , " she sighed . " I do n't care who you are . Hold it careful , mister . "  |p137She  heaved up and waddled out of the room and came back with two thick , smeared glasses . " No fixin's. " she said . " Just what you brought . " She held the glasses out . I poured her a slug that would have made me float over a wall . A smaller one for me . She put hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I poured her another . She took that over to her chair . Her eyes had turned two shades browner . " This stuff dies painless with me , " she said . " It never knows what hit it . What was we talkin ' about ? " " A red-haired girl named Beulah . Used to work at the joint . Rememberbetter now ? " " Yeah . " She used her second drink . I went over and stood the bottle on the table beside her . She used some out of that . " Hold on to your chair and do n't step on no snakes , " she said . " I got me a idea . " She got up out of the chair , sneezed , almost lost her bathrobe , slapped it back against her stomach and stared at me coldly . " No peekin ' , " she said , and wagged a finger at me and went out of the room again , hitting the side of the door casement on her way . From the back of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be kicked over . A bureau drawer was pulled out too far and smashed to the floor . There was fumbling and thudding and loud language . After a while , then , there was the slow click of a lock and what seemed to be the screech of a trunk top going up . More fumbling and banging things around . A tray landed on the floor , I thought . Then a chortle of satisfaction . She came back into the room holding a package tied with faded pink tape . She threw it in my lap . " Look ' em over , Lou . Photos . Newspaper stills . Not that them tramps ever got in no newspapers except by way of the police blotter . They 're people from the joint . By God , they 're all the left me . Them and his old clothes . " She sat down and reached for the whisky again . I untied the tape and looked through a bunch of shiny photos of people in professional poses . Not all of them were women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoofers and comics from the filling-station circuits . Not many of them ever gotp138west of Main Street . The women had good legs and displayed them more than Will Hays would have liked . But their faces were as threadbare as a bookkeeper 's coat . All but one . She wore a Pierrot costume , at least from the waist up . Under the high conical white hat her fluffed-out hair might have been red . Her eyes had laughter in them . I wo n't say her face was unspoiled . I 'm not that good at faces . But it was n't like the others . It had n't been kicked around . Somebody had been nice to that face . Perhaps just a tough mug like Steve Skalla . But he had been nice . In the laughing eyes there was still hope . I threw the others aside and carried this one over to the sprawled , glassy-eyed woman in the chair . I poked it under her nose . " This one , " I said . " Who is she ? What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then chuckled . " Tha 's Steve Skalla 's girl , Lou . Heck , I forgot her name . " " Beulah , " I said . " Beulah 's her name . " She watched me under her tawny , mangled eyebrows . She was n't so drunk . " Yeah ? " she said . " Yeah ? " " Who 's Steve Skalla ? " I rapped . " Bouncer down at the joint , Lou . " She giggled again . " He 's in the pen . " " Oh no , he is n't , " I said . " He 's in town . He 's out . I know him . He just got in . " Her face went to pieces like a clay pigeon . Instantly I knew who had turned Skalla up to the local law . I laughed . I could n't miss . Because she knew . If she had n't known , she would n't have bothered to be cagy about Beulah . She could n't have forgotten Beulah . Nobodycould . Her eyes went far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's faces . Then her hand snatched at the photo . I stepped back and tucked it away in an inside pocket . " Have another drink , " I said . I handed her the bottle . She took it , lingered over it , gurgled it slowly down her throat , staring at the faded carpet . " Yeah , " she said whisperingly . " I turned him in but he neverknew . Money in the bank he was . Money in the bank . " " Give me the girl , " I said . " And Skalla knows nothing from me . " " She 's here , " the woman said . " She 's in radio . I heard her onceon KLBL . She 's changed her name , though . I dunno. "  |p139I  had another hunch . " You do know , " I said . " You 're bleeding her still . Shamey left you nothing . What do you live on ? You 're bleeding her because she pulled herself up in the world , from people like you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Money in the bank , " she croaked . " Hundred a month . Reg'lar as rent . Yeah . " The bottle was on the floor again . Suddenly , without being touched , it fell over on its side . Whisky gurgled out . She did n't move to get it . " Where is she ? " I pounded on . " What 's her name ? " " I du n no , Lou . Part of the deal . Get the money in a cashier 's check . I du n no . Honest . " " The hell you do n't ! " I snarled . " Skalla  --  " She came to her feet in a surge and screamed at me , " Get out , you ! Get out before I call a cop ! Get out , you ! " " Okay , okay . " I put a hand out soothingly . " Take it easy . I wo n't tell Skalla . Just take it easy . " She sat down again slowly and retrieved the almost empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scene now . I could find out other ways . She did n't even look towards me as I went out . I went out into the crisp fall sunlight and got into my car , I was a nice boy , trying to get along . Yes , I was a swell guy . I liked knowing myself . I was the kind of guy who chiseled a sodden old wreck out of her life secretsto win a ten-dollar bet . I drove down to the neighborhood drugstore and shut myself in its phone booth to call Hiney . " Listen , " I told him , " the widow of the man that ran Shamey 's when Skalla worked there is still alive . Skalla might call to see her , if he thinks he dares . " I gave him the address . He said sourly , " We almost got him . A prowl car was talkin ' to a Seventh Street conductor at the end of the line . He mentioned a guy that size and with them clothes . He got off at Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is break into some big house where the folks is away . So we got him bottled . " I told him that was fine . KLBL was on the western fringe of that part of the city that melts into Beverly Hills . It was housed in a flat stucco building , quite unpretentious , and there was a service station in the form of a Dutchp140windmill on the corner of the lot . The call letters of the station revolvedin neon letters on the sails of the windmill . I went into a ground-floor reception room , one side of which was glass and showed an empty broadcasting studio with a stage and ranged chairs for an audience . A few people sat around the receptionroom trying to look magnetic , and the blond receptionist was spearing chocolates out of a large box with nails that were almost royal purple in color . I waited half an hour and then got to see a Mr. Dave Marineau , studio manager . The station manager and the day-program managerwere both too busy to see me . Marineau had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed photographs . Marineau was a handsome tall man , somewhat in the Levantine style , with red lips a little too full , a tiny silky mustache , large limpid brown eyes , shiny black hair that might or might not have been marceled , and long , pale , nicotined fingers . He read my card while I tried to find my Pierrot girl on his wall and did n't . " A private detective , eh ? What can we do for you ? " I took my Pierrot out and placed it down on his beautiful brown blotter . It was fun watching him stare at it . All sorts of minute things happened to his face , none of which he wanted known . The sum total of them was that he knew the face and that it meant something to him . He looked up at me with a bargaining expression . " Not very recent , " he said . " But nice . I do n't know whether we could use it or not . Legs , are n't they ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What would you use it for ? " " Publicity , of course . We get one in the radio column about every second month . We 're a small station still . " " Why ? " " You mean you do n't know who it is ? " " I know who she was , " I said . " Vivian Baring , of course . Star of our Jumbo Candy Bar program . Do n't you know it ? A triweekly serial , half an hour . " " Never heard of it , " I said . " A radio serial is my idea of the square root of nothing . " He leaned back and lit a cigarette , although one was burning on the edge of his glass-lined tray.  | " All right , " he said sarcastically . " Stop being fulsome and get to business . What is it you want ? " " I 'd like her address . " " I ca n't give you that , of course . And you wo n't find it in any phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to gather papers togetherand then saw the second cigarette and that made him feel like a sap . So he leaned back again . " I 'm in a spot , " I said . " I have to find the girl . Quickly . And I do n't want to look like a blackmailer . " He licked his very full and very red lips . Somehow I got the idea he was pleased at something . He said softly , " You mean you know something that might hurt Miss Baring  --  and incidentally the program ? " " You can always replace a star in radio , ca n't you ? " He licked his lips some more . Then his mouth tried to get tough . " I seem to smell something nasty , " he said . " It 's your mustache burning , " I said . It was n't the best gag in the world , but it broke the ice . He laughed . Then he did wingovers with his hands . He leaned forward and got as confidential as a tipster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Obviously . You 're probablyon the level  --  you look it  --  so let me make my play . " He grabbed a leatherbound pad and scribbled on it , tore the leaf off and passed it across . I read : 1737 North Flores Avenue . " That 's her address , " he said . " I wo n't give the phone number without her O.K. Now treat me like a gentleman . That is , if it concernsthe station . " I tucked his paper into my pocket and thought it over . He had suckered me neatly , put me on my few remaining shreds of decency . I made my mistake . " How 's the program going ? " " We 're promised network audition . It 's simple , everyday stuff called A Street in Our Town , ' but it 's done beautifully . It 'll wow the country some day . And soon . " He wiped his hand across his fine white brow . " Incidentally , Miss Baring writes the scripts herself , " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt . She had a boy friend in the big house . That is he used to be . She got to know him in a Centralp142Avenue joint where she worked once . He 's out and he 's looking for her and he 's killed a man . Now wait a minute  --  " He had n't turned as white as a sheet , because he did n't have the right skin . But he looked bad . " Now wait a minute , " I said . " It 's nothing against the girl and you know it . She 's okay . You can see that in her face . It might take a little counterpublicity , if it all came out . But that 's nothing . Look how they gild some of those tramps in Hollywood . " " It costs money , " he said . " We 're a poor studio . And the networkaudition would be off . " There was something faintly dishonest about his manner that puzzled me . " Nuts , " I said , leaning forward and pounding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This tough guy  --  Steve Skalla is his name  --  is in love with her . IIe kills people with his bare hands . He wo n't hurt her , but if she has a boy friend or a husband  --  " " She 's not married , " Marineau put in quickly , watching the rise and fall of my pounding hand . " He might wring his neck for him . That would put it a little too close to her . Skalla does n't know where she is . He 's on the dodge , so it 's harder for him to find out . The cops are your best bet , if you have enough drag to keep them from feeding it to the papers . " " Nix , " he said . " Nix on the cops . You want the job , do n't you ? " " When do you need her here again ? " " Tomorrow night . She 's not on tonight . " " I 'll hide her for you until then , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'd go alone . " He grabbed my card again , read it , dropped it into a drawer . " Get out there and dig her out , " he snapped . " If she 's not home , stick till she is . I 'll get a conference upstairs and then we 'll see . Hurry it ! " I stood up . " Want a retainer ? " he snapped . " That can wait . " He nodded , made some more wingovers with his hands and reached for his phone . That number on Flores would be up near Sunset Towers , across town from where I was . Traffic was pretty thick , but I had n't gone more than twelve blocks before I was aware that a blue coupe which had left the studio parking lot behind me was still behindme.  |p143I  jockeyed around in a believable manner , enough to feel sure it was following me . There was one man in it . Not Skalla . The head was a foot too low over the steering wheel . I jockeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who it was , and at the moment , I had n't time to bother figuring it out . I reached the Flores Avenue place and tucked my roadster into the curb . Bronze gates opened into a nice bungalow court , and two rows of bungalows with steep roofs of molded shingles gave an effect a little like the thatched cottages in old English sporting prints . A very little . The grass was almost too well kept . There was a wide walk and an oblong pool framed in colored tiles and stone benches along its sides . A nice place . The late sun made interesting shadows over its lawns , and except for the motor horns , the distant hum of traffic up on Sunset Boulevard was n't unlike the drone of bees . My number was the last bungalow on the left . Nobody answered the bell , which was set in the middle of the door so that you would wonder how the juice got to where it had to go . That was cute too . I rang time after time , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit down and wait . A woman passed me walking fast , not in a hurry , but like a woman who always walks fast . She was a thin , sharp brunette in burnt-orange tweeds and a black hat that looked like a pageboy 's hat . It looked like the devil with the burnt-orange tweeds . She had a nose that would be in things and tight lips and she swung a key container . She went up to my door , unlocked it , went in . She did n't look like Beulah . I went back and pushed the bell again . The door opened at once . The dark , sharp-faced woman gave me an up-and-down look and said : " Well ? " " Miss Baring ? Miss Vivian Baring ? " " Who ? " It was like a stab . " Miss Vivian Baring  --  of KLBL , " I said . " I was told  --  " She flushed tightly and her lips almost bit her teeth . " If this is a gag , I do n't care for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nose . I said hurriedly , " Mr. Marineau sent me. "  |p144That  stopped the door closing . It opened again , very wide . The woman 's mouth was as thin as a cigarette paper . Thinner . " I , " she said very distinctly , " happen to be Mr. Marineau 's wife . This happens to be Mr. Marineau 's residence . I was n't aware that this  --  this  --  " " Miss Vivian Baring , " I said . But it was n't uncertainty about the name that had stopped her . It was plain , cold fury.  --  that this Miss Baring , " she went on , exactly as though I had not said a word , " had moved in here . Mr. Marineau must be feelingvery amusing today . " " Listen , lady . This is n't  --  " The slamming door almost made a wave in the pool down the walk . I looked at it for a moment , and then I looked at the other bungalows . If we had an audience , it was keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The door jumped open this time . The brunette was livid . " Get off my porch ! " she yelled . " Get off before I have you thrown off ! " " Wait a minute , " I growled . " This may be a gag for him , but it 's no gag to the police . " That got her . Her whole expression got soft and interested . " Police ? " she cooed . " Yeah . It 's serious . It involves a murder . I 've got to find this Miss Baring . Not that she , you understand  --  " The brunette dragged me into the house and shut the door and leaned against it , panting . " Tell me , " she said breathlessly . " Tell me . Has that redheaded something got herself mixed up in a murder ? " Suddenly her mouth snapped wide open and her eyes jumped at me . I slapped a hand over her mouth . " Take it easy ! " I pleaded . " It 's not your Dave . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of my hand and let out a sigh and looked silly . " No , of course . Just for a moment . .. Well , who is it ? " " Nobody you know . I ca n't broadcast things like that , anyway . I want Miss Baring 's address . Have you got it ? " I did n't know any reason why she would have . Or rather , I might be able to think of one , if I shook my brains hard enough . " Yes , " she said . " Yes , I have . Indeed , I have . Mister Smarty does n't know that . Mister Smarty does n't know as much as he thinks he knows , does Mister Smarty ? He  --  " " The address is all I can use right now , " I growled . " And I 'm inp145a bit of a hurry , Mrs. Marineau . Later on  --  " I gave her a meaninglook . " I 'm sure I 'll want to talk to you . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know the number . But I 've been there . I 've been past there . It 's only a short street , with four or five houses , and only one of them on the downward side of the hill . " She stopped , added , " I do n't think the house has a number . Heather Street is at the top of Beachwood Drive . " " Has she a phone ? " " Of course , but a restricted number . She would have . They all do , those . If I knew it  --  " " Yeah , " I said . " You 'd call her up and chew her ear off . Well , thank you very much , Mrs. Marineau . This is confidential , of course . I mean confidential . " " Oh , by all means ! " She wanted to talk longer but I pushed past her out of the house and went back down the flagged walk . I could feel her eyes on me all the way , so I did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full red lips had had what he thought was a very cute idea . He had given me the first addressthat came into his head , his own . Probably he had expected his wife to be out . I did n't know . It looked awfully silly , however I thought about it  --  unless he was pressed for time . Wondering why he should be pressed for time , I got careless . I did n't see the blue coupe double-parked almost at the gates until I also saw the man step from behind it . He had a gun in his hand . He was a big man , but not anything like Skalla 's size . He made a sound with his lips and held his left palm out and something glittered in it . It might have been a piece of tin or a police badge . Cars were parked along both sides of Flores . Half a dozen people should have been in sight . There was n't one  --  except the big man with the gun and myself . He came closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Get in my hack and drive it , like a nice lad . " He had a soft , husky voice , like an overworked rooster trying to croon . " You all alone ? " " Yeah , but I got the gun , " he sighed . " Act nice and you 're as safe as the bearded woman at a Legion convention . Safer . " He was circling slowly , carefully . I saw the metal thing now.  | " That 's a special badge , " I said . " You 've got no more right to pinch me than I have to pinch you . " " In the hack , bo . Be nice or your guts lie on this here street . I got orders . " He started to pat me gently . " Hell , you ai n't even rodded . " " Skip it ! " I growled . " Do you think you could take me if I was ? " I walked over to his blue coupe and slid under its wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his gun in my side and we went on down the hill . " Take her west on Santa Monica , " he husked . " Then up , say , Canyon Drive to Sunset . Where the bridle path is . " I took her west on Santa Monica , past the bottom of Holloway , then a row of junk yards and some stores . The street widened and became a boulevard past Doheney . I let the car out a little to feel it . Ile stopped me doing that . I swung north to Sunset and then west again . Lights were being lit in big houses up the slopes . The dusk was full of radio music . I eased down and took a look at him before it got too dark . Even under the pulled-down hat on Flores I had seen the eyebrows , but I wanted to be sure . So I looked again . They were the eyebrows , all right . They were almost as even , almost as smoothly black , and fully as wide as a half-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes and nose . There was no break in the middle . His nose was large and coarse-grained and had hung out over too many beers . " Bub McCord , " I said . " Ex-copper . So you 're in the snatch racket now . It 's Folsom for you this time , baby . " " Aw , can it . " He looked hurt and leaned back in the corner . Bub McCord , caught in a graft tangle , had done a three in Quentin . Next time he would go to the recidivist prison , which is Folsom in our state . He leaned his gun on his left thigh and cuddled the door with his fat back . I let the car drift and he did n't seem to mind . It was betweentimes , after the homeward rush of the office man , before the evening crowd came out . " This ai n't no snatch , " he complained . " We just do n't want no trouble . You ca n't expect to go up against an organization like KLBL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ai n't rea/sonable . " He spat out of the window without turning his head . " Keep her rollin ' , bo . " " What shakedown ? " " You would n't know , would you ? Just a wandering peeper with his head stuck in a knothole , huh ? That 's you . Innocent , as the guy says . " " So you work for Marineau . That 's all I wanted to know . Of course I knew it already , after I back-alleyed you , and you showed up again . " " Neat work , bo but keep her rollin ' . Yeah , I had to phone in . Just caught him . " " Where do we go from here ? " " I take care of you till nine-thirty . After that we go a place . " " What place ? " " It ai n't nine-thirty . Hey , do n't go to sleep in that there corner . " " Drive it yourself , if you do n't like my work . " He pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coupe out from under him and set him back in his corner , but he kept his gun in a good grip . Somebody called out archly on somebody 's front lawn . Then I saw a red light winking ahead , and a sedan just passing it , and through the rear window of the sedan two flat caps side by side . " You 'll get awfully tired of holding that gun , " I told McCord . " You do n't dare use it anyway . You 're copper-soft . There 's nothing so soft as a copper who 's had his badge torn off . Just a big heel Copper-soft . " We were n't near to the sedan , but I wanted his attention . I got it . He slammed me over the head and grabbed the wheel and yanked the brake on . We ground to a stop . I shook my head woozily . By the time I came out of it he was away from me again , in his corner . " Next time , " he said thinly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep in the rumble . Just try it , bo . Just try it . Now roll  --  and keep the wisecracks down in your belly . " I drove ahead , between the hedge that bordered the bridle path and the wide parkway beyond the curbing . The cops in the sedan tooled on gently , drowsing , listening with half an ear to their radio , talking of this and that . I could almost hear them in my mind , the sort of thing they would be saying.  | " Besides , " McCord growled . " I do n't need no gun to handle you . I never see the guy I could n't handle without no gun . " " I saw one this morning , " I said . I started to tell him about Steve Skalla . Another red stoplight showed . The sedan ahead seemed loath to leave it . McCord lit a cigarette with his left hand , bending his head a little . I kept on telling him about Skalla and the bouncer at Shamey 's . Then I tramped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiver . McCord started to swing his gun at me . I yanked the wheel hard to the right and yelled : " Hold tight ! It 's a crash ! " We hit the prowl car almost on the left rear fender . It waltzed around on one wheel , apparently , and loud language came out of it . It slewed , rubber screamed , metal made a grinding sound , the left taillight splintered and probably the gas tank bulged . The little coupe sat back on its heels and quivered like a scared rabbit . McCord could have cut me in half . His gun muzzle was inches from my ribs . But he was n't a hard guy , really . He was just a broken cop who had done time and got himself a cheap job after it and was on an assignment he did n't understand . He tore the right-hand door open , and jumped out of the car . One of the cops was out by this time , on my side . I ducked clownunder the wheel . A flash beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work . Steps came near and the flash jumped into myface . " Come on out of that , " a voice snarled . " What the hell you think this is  --  a racetrack ? " I got out sheepishly . McCord was crouched somewhere behind the coupe , out of sight . " Lemme smell of your breath . " I let him smell my breath . " Whisky , " he said . " I thought so . Walk , baby . Walk . " He prodded me with the flashlight . I walked . The other cop was trying to jerk his sedan loose from the coupe . He was swearing , but he was busy with his own troubles . " You do n't walk like no drunk , " the cop said . " What 's the mat/ter ? No brakes ? " The other cop had got the bumpers free and was climbing back under his wheel . I took my hat off and bent my head . " Just an argument , " I said . " I got hit . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake . He started running when he heard that . He vaulted across the parkway , jumped the wall and crouched . His footsteps thudded on turf . That was my cue . " Holdup ! " I snapped at the cop who was questioningme . " I was afraid to tell you ! " " Jeeze , the howling  --  ! " he yelled , and tore a gun out of his holster . " Why' n't you say so ? " He jumped for the wall . " Circle the heap ! We want that guy ! " he yelled at the man in the sedan . He was over the wall . Grunts . More feet pounding on the turf . A car stopped half a block away and a man started to get out of it but kept his foot on the running board . I could barely see him behind his dimmed headlights . The cop in the prowl car charged at the hedge that bordered the bridle path , backed furiously , swung around and was off with screamingsiren . I jumped into McCord 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot , then two shots , then a yell . The siren died at a corner and picked up again . I gave the coupe all it had and left the neighborhood . Far off , to the north , a lonely sound against the hills , a siren kept on wailing . I ditched the coupe half a block from Wilshire and took a taxi in front of the Beverly-Wilshire . I knew I could be traced . That was n't important . The important thing was how soon . From a cocktail bar in Hollywood I called Hiney . He was still on the job and still sour . " Anything new on Skalla ? " " Listen , " he said nastily , " was you over to talk to that Shamey woman ? Where are you ? " " Certainly I was , " I said . " I 'm in Chicago . " " You better come on home . Why was you there ? " " I thought she might know Beulah , of course . She did . Want to raise that bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dead . " " Skalla  --  " I started to say.  | " That 's the funny side , " he grunted . " He was there . Some nosy old  --  next door seen him . Only there ai n't a mark on her . She died natural . I kind of got tied up here , so I did n't get over to see her . " " I know how busy you are , " I said in what seemed to me a dead voice . " Yeah . Well , hell , the doc do n't even know what she died of . Not yet . " " Fear , " I said . " She 's the one that turned Skalla up eight years ago . Whisky may have helped a little . " " Is that so ? " Hiney said . " Well , well . We got him now anyways . We make him at Girard , headed north in a rent hack . We got the county and state law in on it . If he drops over to the Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one turned him up , huh ? I guess you better come in , Carmady . " " Not me , " I said . " Beverly Hills wants me for a hit-and-run . I 'm a criminal myself now . " I had a quick snack and some coffee before I took a taxi to Las Flores and Santa Monica and walked up to where I had left my roadster parked . Nothing was happening around there except that some kid in the back of a car was strumming a ukelele . I pointed my roadster towards Heather Street . Heather Street was a gash in the side of a steep flat slope , at the top of Beachwood Drive . It curved around the shoulder enough so that even by daylight you could n't have seen much more than half a block of it at one time while you were on it . The house I wanted was built downward , one of those clingingvineeffects , with a front door below the street level , a patio on the roof , a bedroom or two possibly in the basement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an olive bottle . The garage was empty , but a big shiny sedan had its two right wheels off the road , on the shoulder of the bank . There were lights in the house . I drove around the curb , parked , walked back along the smooth , hardly used cement and poked a fountain pen flash into the sedan . It was registered to one David Marineau , 1737 North Flores Avenue , Hollywood , California . That made me go back to my heap and get a gun out of a locked pocket.  |p151I  repassed the sedan , stepped down three rough stone steps and looked at the bell beside a narrow door topped by a lancet arch . I did n't push it , I just looked at it . The door was n't quite shut . A fairly wide crack of dim light edged around its panel . I pushed it an inch . Then I pushed it far enough to look in . Then I listened . The silence of that house was what made me go in . It was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or perhaps I had n't eaten enough dinner . Anyway I went in . The long living room went clear to the back , which was n't very far as it was a small house . At the back there were french doors and the metal railing of a balcony showed through the glass . The balcony would be very high above the slope of the hill , built as the house was . There were nice lamps , nice chairs with deep sides , nice tables , a thick apricot-colored rug , two small cozy davenports , one facing and one right-angled to a fireplace with an ivory mantel and a miniatureWinged Victory on that . A fire was laid behind the copper screen , but not lit . The room had a hushed , warm smell . It looked like a room where people got made comfortable . There was a bottle of Vat 69 on a low table with glasses and a copper bucket , and tongs . I fixed the door about as I had found it and just stood . Silence . Time passed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a console radio , in the far-off hoot of an auto horn down on Beachwoodhalf a mile below , in the distant hornet drone of a night-flying plane , in the metallic wheeze of a cricket under the house . Then I was n't alone any longer . Mrs. Marineau slid into the room at the far end , by a door beside the french doors . She did n't make any more noise than a butterfly . She still wore the pillbox black hat and the burnt-orange tweeds , and they still looked like hell together . She had a small glove in her hand wrapped around the butt of a gun . I do n't know why . I never did find that out . She did n't see me at once and when she did it did n't mean anythingmuch . She just lifted the gun a little and slid along the carpet towards me , her lip clutched back so far that I could n't even see the teeth that clutched it . But I had a gun out now myself . We looked at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any idea from her expression . I said , " You got them , huh ? " She nodded a little . " Just him , " she said . " Put the gun down . You 're all through with it . " She lowered it a little . She had n't seemed to notice the Colt I was pushing through the air in her general direction . I lowered that too . She said , " She was n't here . " Her voice had a dry , impersonal sound , flat , without timbre . " Miss Baring was n't here ? " I asked . " No . " " Remember me ? " She took a better look at me but her face did n't light up with any pleasure . " I 'm the guy that was looking for Miss Baring , " I said . " You told me where to come . Remember ? Only Dave sent a loogan to put the arm on me and ride me around while he came up here himself and promoted something . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're no cop . Dave said you were a fake . " I made a broad , hearty gesture and moved a little closer to her , unobtrusively . " Not a city cop , " I admitted . " But a cop . And that was a long time ago . Things have happened since then . Have n't they ? " " Yes , " she said . " Especially to Dave . Hee , hee . " It was n't a laugh . It was n't meant to be a laugh . It was just a littlesteam escaping through a safety valve . " Hee , hee , " I said . We looked at each other like a couple of nuts being Napoleon and Josephine . The idea was to get close enough to grab her gun . I was still too far . " Anybody here besides you ? " I asked . " Just Dave . " " I had an idea Dave was here . " It was n't clever , but it was good for another foot . " Oh , Dave 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to see him ? " " Well  --  if it is n't too much trouble . " " Hee , hee , " she said . " No trouble at all . Like this . " She jerked the gun up and snapped the trigger at me . She did it without moving a muscle of her face.  |p153The  gun not going off puzzled her , in a sort of vague , week-beforelastmanner . Nothing immediate or important . I was n't there any more . She lifted the gun up , still being very careful about the black , kid glove wrapped about its butt , and peered into the muzzle . That did n't get her anywhere . She shook the gun . Then she was aware of me again . I had n't moved . I did n't have to , now . " I guess it 's not loaded , " she said . " Maybe just all used up , " I said . " Too bad . These little ones . only hold seven . My shells wo n't fit , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She put the gun in my hand . Then she dusted her hands together .. Her eyes did n't seem to have any pupils , or to be all pupils . I was n't sure which . The gun was n't loaded . The magazine was quite empty . I sniffed the muzzle . The gun had n't been fired since it was last cleaned . That got me . Up to that point it had looked fairly simple , if I could get by without any more murder . But this threw it . I had n't any idea what either of us was talking about now . I dropped her pistol into my side pocket and put mine back on my hip and chewed my lip for a couple of minutes , to see what might turn up . Nothing did . The sharp-faced Mrs. Marineau merely stood still and stared at a spot between my eyes , fuzzily , like a rather blotto tourist seeing a swell sunset on Mount Whitney . " Well , " I said at last , " let 's kind of look through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean Dave ? " " Yeah , we could take that in . " " He 's in the bedroom . " She tittered . " He 's at home in bed-rooms . " I touched her arm and turned her around . She turned obediently , like a small child . " But this one will be the last one he 'll be at home in , " she said .. " Hee , hee . " " Oh yeah . Sure , " I said . My voice sounded to me like the voice of a midget . Dave Marineau was dead all right  --  if there had been any doubt about it . A white bowl lamp with raised figures shone beside a large bed . in a green and silver bedroom . It was the only light in the room.  |p154It  filtered a hushed kind of light down at his face . He had n't been dead long enough to get the corpse look . He lay sprawled casually on the bed , a little sideways , as though he had been standing in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as loose as a strand of kelp and the other was under him . His open eyes were flat and shiny and almost seemed to hold a selfsatisfiedexpression . His mouth was open a little and the lamplight glistened on the edges of his upper teeth . I did n't see the wound at all at first . It was high up , on the right side of his head , in the temple , but back rather far , almost far enough to drive the petrosal bone through the brain . It was powderburned , rimmed with dusky red , and a fine trickle spidered down from it and got browner as it got thinner against his cheek . " Hell , that 's a contact wound , " I snapped at the woman . " A suicide wound . " She stood at the foot of the bed and stared at the wall above his head . If she was interested in anything besides the wall , she did n't show it . I lifted his still limp right hand and sniffed at the place where the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I did n't smell cordite , then I did n't know whether I smelled cordite or not . It did n't matter , of course . A paraffin test would prove it one way or the other . I put the hand down again , carefully , as though it were a fragile thing of great value . Then I plowed around on the bed , went down on the floor , got halfway under the bed , swore , got up again and rolled the dead man to one side enough to look under him . There was a bright , brassy shellcase but no gun . It looked like murder again . I liked that better . He was n't the suicide type . " See any gun ? " I asked her . " No . " Her face was as blank as a pie pan . " Where 's the Baring girl ? What are you supposed to be doing here ? " She bit the end of her left little finger . " I 'd better confess , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " I said . " Nobody was here . Of course , after I phoned him and he told me you were not a real cop and there was no murder and you werep155a blackmailer and just trying to scare me out of the address  --  " She stopped and sobbed once , hardly more than a sniff , and moved her line of sight to a corner of the ceiling . Her words had a tumbled arrangement , but she spoke them like a drugstore Indian . " I came here to kill both of them , " she said . " I do n't deny that . " " With an empty gun ? " " It was n't empty two days ago . I looked . Dave must have emptied it . He must have been afraid . " " That listens , " I said . " Go on . " " So I came here . That was the last insult  --  his sending you to me to get her address . That was more than I would  --  " " The story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've read it in the love mags myself . " " Yes . Well , he said there was something about Miss Baring he had to see her about on account of the studio and it was nothing personal , never had been , never would be  --  " " My Gawd , " I said , " I know that too . I know what he 'd feed you . We 've got a dead man lying around here . We 've got to do something , even if he was just your husband . " " You , " she said . " Yeah , " I said . " That 's better than the dopey talk . Go on . " " The door was n't shut . I came in . That 's all . Now , I 'm going . And you 're not going to stop me . You know where I live , you  --  . " She called me the same name again . " We 'll talk to some law first , " I said . I went over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and took it out . Then I went over to the french doors . The woman gave me looks , but I could n't hear what her lips were calling me now . French doors on the far side of the bed opened on the same balconyas the living room . The telephone was in a niche in the wall there , by the bed , where you could yawn and reach out for it in the morning and order a tray of diamond necklaces sent up to try on . I sat down on the side of the bed and reached for the phone , and a muffled voice came to me through the glass and said : " Hold it , pal ! Just hold it ! " Even muffled by the glass it was a deep , soft voice . I had heard it before . It was Skalla 's voice . I was in line with the lamp . The lamp was right behind me . I dived off the bed on to the floor , clawing at my hip.  |p156A  shot roared and glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure it . Skalla was n't on the balcony . I had looked . I rolled over and started to snake away along the floor away from the french doors , my only chance with the lamp where it was . Mrs. Marineau did just the right thing  --  for the other side . She jerked a slipper off and started slamming me with the heel of it . I grabbed for her ankles and we wrestled around and she cut the top of my head to pieces . I threw her over . It did n't last long . When I started to get up Skalla was in the room , laughing at me . The .45 still had a home in his fist . The french door and the locked screen outside looked as though a rogue elephant had passed that way . " Okay , " I said . " I give up . " " Who 's the twist ? She sure likes you , pal . " I got up on my feet . The woman was over in a corner somewhere . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I give you the fan . " I had n't worked my gun loose yet . He got that . I did n't say anything about the door key , but he took it . So he must have been watching from somewhere . He left me my car keys . He looked at the little empty gun and dropped it back in my pocket . " Where 'd you come from ? " I asked . " Easy . Clumb up the balcony and held on , looking through the grill at you . Cinch to an old circus man . How you been , pal ? " Blood from the top of my head was leaking down my face . I got a handkerchief out and mopped at it . I did n't answer him . " Jeeze , you sure was funny on the bed grabbin ' for the phone with the stiff at your back . " " I was a scream , " I growled . " Take it easy . He 's her husband . " He looked at her . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " That 's tough . If I 'd a known  --  but I could n't help meself . The guy asked for it . " " You  --  " I started to say , staring at him . I heard a queer , strained whine behind me , from the woman . " Who else , pal ? Who else ? Let 's all go back in that livin ' room . Seems to me they was a bottle of nice-looking hooch there . And you need some stuff on that head . " " You 're crazy to stick around here , " I growled . " There 's a gen/eral pickup out for you . The only way out of this canyon is back down Beachwood or over the hills  --  on foot . " Skalla looked at me and said very quietly , " Nobody 's phoned no law from here , pal . " Skalla watched me while I washed and put some tape on my head in the bathroom . Then we went back to the living room . Mrs. Marineau , curled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlit fire . She did n't say anything . She had n't run away because Skalla had her in sight all the time . She acted resigned , indifferent , as if she did n't care what happened now . I poured three drinks from the Vat 69 bottle , handed one to the brunette . She held her hand out for the glass , half smiled at me , crumpled off the davenport to the floor with the smile still on her face . I put the glass down , lifted her and put her back on the davenport with her head low . Skalla stared at her . She was out cold , as white as paper . Skalla took his drink , sat down on the other davenport and put the .45 beside him . He drank his drink looking at the woman , with a queer expression on his big pale face . " Tough , " he said . " Tough . But the louse was cheatin ' on her anyways . The hell with him . " He reached for another drink , swallowed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one she lay on . " So you 're a dick , " he said . " How 'd you guess ? " " Lu Shamey told me about a guy goin ' there . He sounded like you . I been around and looked in your heap outside . I walk silent . " " Well  --  what now ? " I asked . He looked more enormous than ever in the room in his sports clothes . The clothes of a smart-aleck kid . I wondered how long it had taken him to get them together . They could n't have been ready-made . He was much too big for that . His feet were spread wide on the apricot rug , he looked down sadly at the white kid explosions on the suede . They were the worstlookingshoes I ever saw . " What you doin ' here ? " he asked gruffly . " Looking for Beulah . I thought she might need a little help . Ip158had a bet with a city cop I 'd find her before he found you . But I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her , huh ? " I shook my head , slowly , very carefully . He said softly , " Me neither , pal . I been around for hours . She ai n't been home . Only the guy in the bedroom come here . How about the dinge manager up at Shamey 's ? " " That 's what the tag 's for . " " Yeah . A guy like that . They would . Well , I got ta blow . I 'd like to take the stiff , account of Beulah . Ca n't leave him around to scare her . But I guess it ai n't any use now . The dinge kill queers that . " He looked at the woman at his elbow on the other little davenport . Her face was still greenish white , her eyes shut . There was a movement of her breast . " Without her , " he said , " I guess I 'd clean up right and button you good . " He touched the .45 at his side . " No hard feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it is  --  heck , I ca n't knock the frail off . " " Too bad , " I snarled , feeling my head . He grinned . " I guess I 'll take your heap . For a short ways . Throw them keys over . " I threw them over . He picked them up and laid them beside the big Colt . He leaned forward a little . Then he reached back into one of his patch pockets and brought out a small pearl-handled gun , about .25 caliber . He held it on the flat of his hand . " This done it , " he said . " I left a rent hack I had on the street belowand come up the bank and around the house . I hear the bell ring . This guy is at the front door . I do n't come up far enough for him to see me . Nobody answers . Well , what do you think ? The guy 's got a key . A key to Beulah 's house ! " His huge face became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more deeply , and I thought I saw one of her eyelids twitch . " What the hell , " I said . " He could get that a dozen ways . He 's a boss at KLBL where she works . He could get at her bag , take an impression . Hell , she did n't have to give it to him . " " That 's right , pal . " He beamed . " O ' course , she did n't have to give it to the . Okay , he went in , and I made it fast after him . But he had the door shut . I opened it my way . After that it did n't shut so good , you might of noticed . He was in the middle of thisp159here room , over there by a desk . He 's been here before all right though "  --  the scowl came back again , although not quite so black  --  " because he slipped a hand into the desk drawer and come up with this . " He danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face now had distinct lines of tensity . " So I start for him . He lets one go . A miss . He 's scared and runs into the bedroom . Me after . He lets go again . Another miss . You 'll find them slugs in the wall somewheres . " " I 'll make a point of it , " I said . " Yeah , then I got him . Well , hell , the guy 's only a punk in a white muffler . If she 's washed up with me , okay . I want it from her , see ? Not from no greasy-faced piece of cheese like him . So I 'm sore . But the guy 's got guts at that . " He rubbed his chin . I doubted the last bit . " I say : ' My woman lives here , pal . How come ? ' He says : Come back tomorrow . This here is my night . ' " Skalla spread his free left hand in a large gesture . " After that nature'sgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull his arms and legs off . Only while I 'm doing it the damn little gat pops off and he 's as limp as  --  as  --  " he glanced at the woman and did n't finish what he was going to say . " Yeah , he was dead . " One of the woman 's eyelids flickered again . I said , " Then ? " " I scrammed . A guy does . But I come back . I got to thinkin ' it 's tough on Beulah , with that stiff on her bed . So I 'll just go back and ferry him out to the desert and then crawl in a hole for a while . Then this frail comes along and spoils that part . " The woman must have been shamming for quite a long time . She must have been moving her legs and feet and turning her body a fraction of an inch at a time , to get in the right position , to get leverage against the back of the davenport . The pearl-handled gun still lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the davenport in a flat dive , gathering herself in the air like an acrobat . She brushed his knees and picked the gun off his hand as neatly as a chipmunk peels a nut . He stood up and swore as she rolled against his legs . The big Colt was at his side , but he did n't touch it or reach for it . He stooped to take hold of the woman with his big hands empty . She laughed just before she shot him . She shot him four times , in the lower belly , then the hammerp160clicked . She threw the gun at his face and rolled away from him . He stepped over her without touching her . His big pale face was quite empty for a moment , then it settled into stiff lines of torture , lines that seemed to have been there always . He walked erectly along the rug towards the front door . I jumped for the big Colt and got it . To keep it from the woman . At the fourth step he took , blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it showed at every step he took . He reached the door and put his big hand flat against the wood and leaned there for a moment . Then he shook his head and turned back . His hand left a bloody smear on the door from where he had been holding his belly . He sat down in the first chair he came to and leaned forward and held himself tightly with his hands . The blood came between his fingers slowly , like water from an overflowing basin . " Them little slugs , " he said , " hurt just like the big ones , down below anyways . " The dark woman walked towards him like a marionette . He watched her come unblinkingly , under his half-lowered , heavy lids . When she got close enough she leaned over and spat in his face . He did n't move . His eyes did n't change . I jumped for her and threw her into a chair . I was n't nice about it . " Leave her alone , " he grunted at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop me from telephoning this time . Hours later I sat on a red stool at Lucca 's , at Fifth and Western , and sipped a martini and wondered how it felt to be mixing them all day and never drink one . I took another martini over and ordered a meal . I guess I ate it . It was late , past one . Skalla was in the prison ward of the General Hospital . Miss Baring had n't showed up yet , but they knew she would , as soon as she heard Skalla was under glass , and no longer dangerous . KLBL , who did n't know anything about it at first , had got a nice hush working . They were to have twenty-four clear hours to decidehow to release the story . Lucca 's was almost as full as at noon . After a while an Italian brunette t  --  , a , and nose and eyes you would n't fool with came over and , , aid : " I have a table for you now . " My imagination put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes had something in them that was more than mere pain ,  |p161something  he wanted me to do . Part of the time he was trying to tell me what it was , and part of the time he was holding his belly in one piece and saying again : " Leave her alone . Maybe she loved the guy . " I left there and drove north to Franklin and over Franklin to Beachwood and up to Heather Street . It was n't staked . They were that sure of her . I drifted along the street below and looked up the scrubby slope spattered with moonlight and showing her house from behind as if it were three stories high . I could see the metal brackets that supportedthe porch . They looked high enough off the ground so that a man would need a balloon to reach them . But there was where he had gone up . Always the hard way with him . He could have run away and had a fight for his money or even bought himself a place to live up in . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't fool with Skalla . But he had come back instead to climb her balcony , like Romeo , and get his stomach full of slugs . From the wrong woman , as usual . I drove around a white curve that looked like moonlight itself and parked and walked up the hill the rest of the way . I carried a flash , but I did n't need it to see there was nobody on the doorstep waiting for the milk . I did n't go in the front way . There might just happen to be some snooper with night glasses up on the hill . I sneaked up the bank from behind , between the house and the empty garage . I found a window I could reach and made not much noise breaking it with a gun inside my hat . Nothing happened except that the crickets and tree frogs stopped for a moment . I picked a way to the bedroom and prowled my flash around discreetly , after lowering the shades and pulling the drapes across them . The light dropped on a tumbled bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the window sills and heel marks in the nap of the carpet . There was a green and silver toilet set on the dressing table and three suitcases in the closet . There was a built-in bureau back in there with a lock that meant business . I had a chilled-steel screwdriver with me as well as the flash . I jimmied it . The jewelry was n't worth a thousand dollars . Perhaps not half . But it meant a lot to a girl in show business . I put it back where I got it . The living room had shut windows and a queer , unpleasant , sadistic smell . The law enforcement had taken care of the Vat 6g , top162make it easier for the fingerprint men . I had to use my own . I got a chair that had n't been bled on into a corner , wet my throat and waited in the darkness . A shade flapped in the basement or somewhere . That made me wet my throat again . Somebody came out of a house half a dozen blocks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree frogs started again , then the crickets . Then the electric clock on the radio got louder than all the other sounds together . Then I went to sleep . When I woke up the moon had gone from the front windows and a car had stopped somewhere . Light , delicate , careful steps separatedthemselves from the night . They were outside the front door . A key fumbled in the lock . In the opening door the dim sky showed a head without a hat . The slope of the hill was too dark to outline any more . The door clicked shut . Steps rustled on the rug . I already had the lamp cord in my fingers . I yanked it and there was light . The girl did n't make a sound , not a whisper of sound . She just pointed the gun at me . I said , " Hello , Beulah . " She was worth waiting for . Not too tall , not too short ; that girl . She had the long legs that can walk and dance . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a brush fire at night . Her face had laughter wrinkles at the corner of the eyes . Her mouth could laugh . The features were shadowed and had that drawn look that makes some faces more beautiful because it makes them more delicate . I could n't see her eyes . They might have been blue enough to make you jump , but I could n't see . The gun looked about a .32 , but had the extreme right-angled grip of a Mauser . After a while she said very softly , " Police , I suppose . " She had a nice voice , too . I still think of it , at times . I said , " Let 's sit down and talk . We 're all alone here . Ever drink out of the bottle ? " She did n't answer . She looked down at the gun she was holding , half smiled , shook her head . " You would n't make two mistakes , " I said . " Not a girl as smart as you are . "  |p163She  tucked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a military collar . " Who are you ? " " Just a shamus . Private detective to you . Carmady is the name . Need a lift ? " I held my bottle out . It had n't grown to my hand yet . I still had to hold it . " I do n't drink . Who hired you ? " " KLBL . To protect you from Steve Skalla . " " So they know , " she said . " So they know about him . " I digested that and said nothing . " Who 's been here ? " she went on sharply . She was still standing in the middle of the room , with her hands in her coat pockets now , and no hat . " Everybody but the plumber , " I said . " He 's a little late , as usual . " " You 're one of those men . " Her nose seemed to curl a little . " Drugstore comics . " " No , " I said . " Not really . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to . Skalla came back again and ran into trouble and got shot up and arrested . He 's in the hospital . Pretty bad . " She did n't move . " How bad ? " " He might live if he 'd have surgery . Doubtful , even with that . Hopeless without . He has three in the intestines and one in the liver . " She moved at last and started to sit down . " Not in that chair , " I said quickly . " Over here . " She came over and sat near me , on one of the davenports . Lights twisted in her eyes . I could see them now . Little twisting lights like Catherine wheels spinning brightly . She said , " Why did he come back ? " " He thought he ought to tidy up . Remove the body and so on . A nice guy , Skalla . " " Do you think so ? " " Lady , if nobody else in the world thinks so , I do . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed her the bottle . I grabbed it away in a hurry . " Gosh , " I said . " You have to break in on this stuff . " She looked towards the side door that led to the bedroom back of me . " Gone to the morgue , " I said . " You can go in there . "  |p164She  stood up at once and went out of the room . She came back almost at once . " What have they got on Steve ? " she asked . " If he recovers . " " He killed a nigger over on Central this morning . It was more or less self-defense on both sides . I do n't know . Except for Marineau he might get a break . " " Marineau ? " she said . " Yeah . You knew he killed Marineau . " " Do n't be silly , " she said . " I killed Dave Marineau . " " Okay , " I said . " But that 's not the way Steve wants it . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here deliberately to take the blame ? " " If he had to , I guess . I think he really meant to cart Marineau off to the desert and lose him . Only a woman showed up here  --  Mrs. Marineau . " " Yes , " the girl said tonelessly . " She thinks I was his mistress . That greasy spoon . " " Were you ? " I asked . " Do n't try that again , " she said . " Even if I did work on Central Avenue once . " She went out of the room again . Sound of a suitcase being yanked about came into the livingroom . I went in after her . She was packing pieces of cobweb and packing them as if she liked nice things nicely packed . " You do n't wear that stuff down in the tank , " I told her , leaning in the door . She ignored me some more . " I was going to make a break for Mexico , " she said . " Then South America . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to blackmail me into something and I went and got the gun . Then we struggled again and it went off . Then I ran away . " " Just what Skalla said he did , " I said . " Hell , could n't you just have shot the on purpose ? " " Not for your benefit , " she said . " Or any cop . Not when I did eight months in Dalhart , Texas , once for rolling a drunk . Not with that Marineau woman yelling her head off that I seduced him and then got sick of him . " " A lot she 'll say , " I grunted . " After I tell how she spat in Skalla 's face when he had four slugs in him . " She shivered . Her face whitened . She went on taking the things out of the suitcase and putting them in again.  | " Did you roll the drunk really ? " She looked up at me , then down . " Yes , " she whispered . I went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes to show ? " I asked . " No . " " Too bad , " I said , and took hold of her . Her eyes flamed at first and then turned to black stone . I tore her coat off , tore her up plenty , put hard fingers into her arms and neck and used my knuckles on her mouth . I let her go , panting . She reeled away from me , but did n't quite fall . " We 'll have to wait for the bruises to set and darken , " I said . " Then we 'll go downtown . " She began to laugh . Then she went over to the mirror and looked at herself . She began to cry . " Get out of here while I change my clothes ! " she yelled . " I 'll give it a tumble . But if it makes any difference to Steve  --  I 'm goingto tell it right . " " Aw , shut up and change your clothes , " I said . I went out and banged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have done that , at least . She would n't have minded any more than the rest of the knocking about I gave her . We rode the rest of the night , first in separate cars to hide hers in my garage , then in mine . We rode up the coast and had coffee and sandwiches at Malibu , then on up and over . We had breakfast at the bottom of the Ridge Route , just north of San Fernando . Her face looked like a catcher 's mitt after a tough season . She had a lower lip the size of a banana and you could have cooked steaks on the bruises on her arms and neck , they were so hot . With the first strong daylight we went to the City Hall . They did n't even think of holding her or checking her up . They practically wrote the statement themselves . She signed it blankeyed , thinking of something else . Then a man from KLBL and his wife came down to get her . So I did n't get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Skalla either , not then . He was under morphine . He died at two-thirty the same afternoon . She was holding one of his huge , limp fingers , but he did n't know her from the Queen of Siam.  |p169I  WAS smoking my pipe and making faces at the back of my name on the glass part of the office door when Violets M'Gee called me up . There had n't been any business in a week . " How 's the sleuth racket , huh ? " Violets asked . He 's a homicide dick in the sheriff 's office . " Take a little flutter down at the beach ? Body guarding or something , it is . " " Anything that goes with a dollar , " I said . " Except murder . I get three-fifty for that . " " I bet you do nice neat work too . Here 's the lay , John . " He gave me the name , address and telephone number of a man named Lindley Paul who lived at Castellamare , was a socialite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jap servant , and drove a very large car . The sheriff 's office had nothing against him except that he had too much fun . Castellamare was in the city limits , but did n't look it , being a couple of dozen houses of various sizes hanging by their eyebrows to the side of a mountain , and looking as if a good sneeze would drop them down among the box lunches on the beach . There was a sidewalk cafe up on the highway , and beside that a cement arch which was really a pedestrian bridge . From the inner end of this a flight of white concrete steps went straight as a ruler up the side of the mountain . Quinonal Avenue , Mr. Lindley Paul had told me over the phone , was the third street up , if I cared to walk . It was , he said , the easiest way to find his place the first time , the streets being designed in a pattern of interesting but rather intricate curves . People had been known to wander about in them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bait can . So I parked my old blue Chrysler down below and walked up . It was a fine evening and there was still some sparkle on the waterp170when I started . It had all gone when I reached the top . I sat down on the top step and rubbed my leg muscles and waited for my pulse to come down into the low hundreds . After that I shook my shirt loose from my back and went along to the house , which was the only one in the foreground . It was a nice enough house , but it did n't look like really importantmoney . There was a salt-tarnished iron staircase going up to the front door and the garage was underneath the house . A long black battleship of a car was backed into it , an immense streamlinedboat with enough hood for three cars and a coyote tail tied to the radiator cap . It looked as if it had cost more than the house . The man who opened the door at the top of the iron stairs wore a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar . He had a soft brown neck , like the neck of a very strong woman . He had pale blue-green eyes , about the color of an aquamarine , features on the heavy side but very handsome , three precise ledges of thick blond hair rising from a smooth brown forehead , an inch more of height than I had  --  which made him six feet one  --  and the general look of a guy who would wear a white flannel suit with a violet satin scarf inside the collar . He cleared his throat , looked over my left shoulder , and said : " Yes ? " " I 'm the man you sent for . The one Violets M'Gee recom-mended . " " Violets ? Gracious , what a peculiar nickname . Let me see , your name is  --  " He hesitated and I let him work at it until he cleared his throat again and moved his blue-green eyes to a spot several miles beyond my other shoulder . " Dalmas , " I said . " The same as it was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalmas . You 'll excuse me , I 'm sure . My houseboy is away this evening . So I  --  " He smiled deprecatingly at the closing door , as though opening and closing it himself sort of dirtied him . The door put us on a balcony that ran around three sides of a big living room , only three steps above it in level . We went down the steps and Lindley Paul pointed with his eyebrows at a pink chair , and I sat down on it and hoped I would n't leave a mark . It was the kind of room where people sit on floor cushions withp171their feet in their laps and sip absinthe through lumps of sugar and talk from the backs of their throats , and some of them just squeak . There were bookshelves all around the balcony and bits of angular sculpture in glazed clay on pedestals . There were cozy little divans and bits of embroidered silk tossed here and there against the bases of lamps and so on . There was a big rosewood grand piano and on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and under its leg there was a peach-colored Chinese rug a gopher could have spent a week in without showing his nose above the nap . Lindley Paul leaned in the curve of the piano and lit a cigarette without offering me one . He put his head back to blow smoke at the tall ceiling and that made his throat look more than ever like the throat of a woman . " It 's a very slight matter , " he said negligently . " Really hardly worth bothering you about . But I thought I might as well have an escort . You must promise not to flash any guns or anything like that . I suppose you do carry a gun . " " Oh , yes , " I said . " Yes . " I looked at the dimple in his chin . You could have lost a marble in it . " Well , I wo n't want you to use it , you know , or anything like that . I 'm just meeting a couple of men and buying something from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash . " " How much money and what for ? " I asked , putting one of my own matches to one of my own cigarettes . " Well , really  --  " It was a nice smile , but I could have put the heel of my hand in it without feeling bad . I just did n't like the man . " It 's rather a confidential mission I 'm undertaking for a friend . I 'd hardly care to go into the details , " he said . " You just want me to go along to hold your hat , " I suggested . His hand jerked and some ash fell on his white suit cuff . That annoyed him . He frowned down at it , then he said softly , in the manner of a sultan suggesting a silk noose for a harem lady whose tricks have gone stale : " You are not being impertinent , I hope . " " Hope is what keeps us alive , " I said . He stared at me for a while . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nose , " he said . " That 's more like it , " I said . " You could n't do it without hardeningup a bit , but I like the spirit . Now let 's talk business . "  |p172He  was still a bit sore . " I ordered a bodyguard , " he said coldly . " If I employed a private secretary I should n't tell him all my personal business . " " He 'd know it if he worked for you steady . He 'd know it upside down and backwards . But I 'm just day labor . You 've got to tell me . What is it  --  blackmail ? " After a long time he said : " No . It 's a necklace of Fei Tsui jade worth at least seventy-five thousand dollars . Did you ever hear of Fei Tsui jade ? " " No . " " We 'll have a little brandy and I 'll tell you about it . Yes , we 'll have a little brandy . " He leaned away from the piano and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist . I put my cigarette out and sniffed at the air and thought I smelled sandalwood , and then Lindley Paul came back with a nice-looking bottle and a couple of sniffing glasses . He poured a tablespoonful in each and handed me a glass . I put mine down in one piece and waited for him to get through rolling his spoonful under his nose and talk . He got around to it after a while . He said in a pleasant enough tone : " Fei Tsui jade is the only really valuable kind . The others are valuable for the workmanship put on them , chiefly . Fei Tsui is valuable in itself . There are no known unworked deposits , very little of it in existence , all the known deposits having been exhausted hundreds of years ago . A friend of mine had a necklace of this jade . Fifty-one carved mandarinbeads , perfectly matched , about six carats each . It was taken in a holdup some time ago . It was the only thing taken , and we were warned  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why I 'm taking the risk of making the pay-off  --  not to tell the police or any insurance company , but wait for a phone call . The call came in a couple of days , the price was set at ten thousand dollars , and the time is tonight at eleven . I have n't heard the place yet . But it 's to be somewhere fairly near here , somewhere along the Palisades . " I looked into my empty sniffing glass and shook it . He put a little more brandy in it for me . I sent that after the first dose and lit another cigarette , one of his this time , a nice Virginia Straight Cut with his monogram on the paper.  | " Jewel ransom racket , " I said . " Well organized , or they would n't know where and when to pull the job . People do n't wear valuable jewels out very much , and half of the time , when they do , they 're phonies . Is jade hard to imitate ? " " As to material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmanship  --  that would take a lifetime . " " So the stuff ca n't be cut , " I said . " Which means it ca n't be fenced except for a small fraction of the value . So the ransom money is the gang 's only pay-off . I 'd say they 'll play ball . You left your bodyguard problem pretty late , Mr. Paul . How do you know they 'll stand for a bodyguard ? " " I do n't , " he said rather wearily . " But I 'm no hero . I like company in the dark . If the thing misses  --  it misses . I thought of goingit alone and then I thought , why not have a man hidden in the back of my car , just in case ? " " In case they take your money and give you a dummy package ? How could I prevent that ? If I start shooting and come out on top and it is a dummy package , you 'll never see your jade again . The contact men wo n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't open up , they 'll be gone before you can see what they 've left you . They may not even give you anything . They may tell you your stuff will come to you through the mail after the money has been checked for markings . Is it marked ? " " My God , no ! " " It ought to be , " I growled . " It can be marked these days so that only a microscope and black light could show the markings up . But that takes equipment , which means cops . Okay . I 'll take a flutter at it . My part will cost you fifty bucks . Better give it to me now , in case we do n't come back . I like to feel money . " His broad , handsome face seemed to turn a little white and glistening . He said swiftly : " Let 's have some more brandy . " He poured a real drink this time . We sat around and waited for the phone to ring . I got my fifty bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded from his voice as if women were talking to him . The call we wanted did n't come through until ten-forty.  |p174I  DROVE . Or rather I held the wheel of the big black car and let it drive itself . I was wearing a sporty light-colored overcoat and hat belonging to Lindley Paul . I had ten grand in hundred-dollar bills in one of the pockets . Paul was in the back seat . He had a silvermountedLuger that was a pip to look at , and I hoped he knew how to use it . There was n't anything about the job I liked . The meeting place was a hollow at the head of Purissima Canyon , about fifteen minutes from the house . Paul said he knew the spot fairly well and would n't have any trouble directing me . We switchbacked and figure-eighted around on the side of the mountain until I got dizzy and then all of a sudden we were out on the state highway , and the lights of the streaming cars were a solid white beam as far as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their way . We turned inland past a service station at Sunset Boulevard . There was loneliness then , and for a while the smell of kelp , not very strong , and the smell of wild sage dripping down the dark slopes much stronger . A dim , distant yellow window would peek down at us from the crest of some realtor 's dream . A car would growl by and its white glare would hide the hills for a moment . There was a half-moon and wisps of cold fog chasing it down the sky . " Off here is the Bel-Air Beach Club , " Paul said . " The next canyonis Las Pulgas and the next after that is Purissima . We turn off at the top of the next rise . " His voice was hushed , taut . It did n't have any of the Park Avenue brass of our earlier acquaintance . " Keep your head down , " I growled back at him . " We may be watched all the way . This car sticks out like spats at an Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me until , " Turn right here , " he whispered sharply at the top of the next hill . I swung the black car into a wide , weed-grown boulevard that had never jelled into a traffic artery . The black stumps of unfinishedelectroliers jutted up from the crusted sidewalk . Brush leaned over the concrete from the waste land behind . I could hearp175crickets chirp and tree frogs drone behind them . The car was that silent . There was a house to a block now , all dark . The folks out there went to bed with the chickens it seemed . At the end of this road the concrete stopped abruptly and we slid down a dirt slope to a dirt terrace , then down another slope , and a barricade of what looked like four-by-fours painted white loomed across the dirt road . I heard a rustling behind me and Paul leaned over the seat , with a sigh in his whispered voice . " This is the spot . You 've got to get out and move that barricade and drive on down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a quick exit , as we 'd have to back out with his car . They want their time to get away . " " Shut up and keep down unless you hear me yell , " I said . I cut the almost noiseless motor and sat there listening . The crickets and tree frogs got a little louder . I heard nothing else . Nobodywas moving nearby , or the crickets would have been still . I touched the cold butt of the gun under my arm , opened the car door and slid out on to the hard clay , stood there . There was brush all around . I could smell the sage . There was enough of it to hide an army . I went towards the barricade . Perhaps this was just a tryout , to see if Paul did what he was told to do . I put my hands out  --  it took both of them  --  and started to lift a section of the white barrier to one side . It was n't a tryout . The largest flashlight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fifteen feet away . A thin , high , niggerish voice piped out of the darkness behind the flash : " Two of us with shotguns . Put them mitts up high an ' empty . We ai n't takin ' no chances . " I did n't say anything . For a moment I just stood holding the barricade inches off the ground . Nothing from Paul or the car . Then the weight of the four-by-fours pulled my muscles and my brain said let go and I put the section down again . I put my hands slowly into the air . The flash pinned me like a fly squashed on the wall . I had no particular thought except a vague wonder if there had n't been a better way for us to work it . " Tha 's fine , " the thin , high , whining voice said . " Jes ' hold like that until I git aroun ' to you . " The voice awakened vague echoes in my brain . It did n't meanp176anything though . My memory had too many such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp figure detached itself from the fan of light , immediately ceased to be sharp or of any shape at all , and became a vague rustling off to the side . Then the rustling was behind me . I kept my hands in the air and blinked at the glare of the flash . A light finger touched my back , then the hard end of a gun . The half-remembered voice said : " This may hurt jes ' a little . " A giggle and a swishing sound . A white , hot glare jumped through the top of my head . I piled down on the barricade and clawed at it and yelled . My right hand tried to jerk down under my left arm . I did n't hear the swishing sound the second time . I only saw the white glare get larger and larger , until there was nothing else anywherebut hard , aching white light . Then there was darkness in which something red wriggled like a germ under the microscope . Then there was nothing red and nothing wriggling , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke up looking fuzzily at a star and listening to two goblins talking in a black hat . " Lou Lid . " " What 's that ? " " Lou Lid . " " Who 's Lou Lid ? " " A tough dinge gunman you saw third-degreed once down at the Hall . " " Oh . . . Lou Lid . " I rolled over and clawed at the ground and crawled up on one knee . I groaned . There was n't anybody there . I was talking to myself , coming out of it . I balanced myself , holding my hands flat on the ground , listening , not hearing anything . When I moved my hands , dried burrs stuck to the skin and the sticky ooze from the purple sage from which wild bees get most of their honey . Honey was sweet . Much , much too sweet , and too hard on the stomach . I leaned down and vomited . Time passed and I gathered my insides together again . I still did n't hear anyth ; ' hut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously , like an old man getting out of a tub bath . My feet did n't have much feeling in them and my legs were rubbery . Ip177wobbled and wiped the cold sweat of nausea off my forehead and felt the back of my head . It was soft and pulpy , like a bruised peach . When I touched it I could feel the pain clear down to my ankles . I could feel every pain I ever felt since the first time I got kicked in the rear in grade school . Then my eyes cleared enough for me to see the outlines of the shallow bowl of wild land , with brush growing on the banks all around like a low wall , and a dirt road , indistinct under the sinking moon , crawling up one side . Then I saw the car . It was quite close to me , not more than twenty feet away . I just had n't looked in that direction . It was Lindley Paul 's car , lightless . I stumbled over to it and instinctively grabbed under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any gun there now . The whiny guy whose voice reminded me of someone would have seen to that . But I still had a fountain-pen flash . I unshipped it , opened the rear door of the car and poked the light in . It did n't show anything  --  no blood , no torn upholstery , no starred or splintered glass , no bodies . The car did n't seem to have been the scene of a battle . It was just empty . The keys hung on the ornate panel . It had been driven down there and left . I pointed my little flash at the ground and began to prowl , looking for him . He 'd be around there all right , if the car was . Then in the cold silence a motor throbbed above the rim of the bowl . The light in my hand went out . Other lights  --  headlights  --  tilted up over the frayed bushes . I dropped and crawled swiftly behind the hood of Lindley Paul 's car . The lights tilted down , got brighter . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl . I could hear the dull , idling sound of a small motor now . Halfway down the car stopped . A spotlight at the side of the windshield clicked on and swung to one side . It lowered , held steady on some point I could n't see . The spot clicked off again and the car came slowly on down the slope . At the bottom it turned a little so that its headlights raked the black sedan . I took my upper lip between my teeth and did n't feel myself biting it until I tasted the blood . The car swung a little more . Its lights went out abruptly . Its motor died and once more the night became large and empty and black and silent . Nothing  --  no movement , except the crickets andp178tree frogs far off that had been droning all the time , only I had n't been hearing them . Then a door latch snapped and there was a light , quick step on the ground and a beam of light cut across the top of my head like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  strained , taut as a mandolin wire . And the white beam jumped under the big black car and hit my feet . The girl 's voice said sharply : " All right , you . Come out of there with your hands up  --  and very damned empty ! I 've got you covered ! " I did n't move . The voice stabbed at me again . " Listen , I 've got three slugs for your feet , mister , and seven more for your tummy , and spare clips , and I change them plenty fast . Coming ? " " Put that toy up ! " I snarled . " Or I 'll blow it out of your hand . " My voice sounded like somebody else 's voice . It was hoarse and thick . " Oh , a hard-boiled gentleman . " There was a little quaver in the voice now . Then it hardened again . " Coming ? I 'll count three . Look at all the odds I 'm giving you  --  twelve big fat cylinders to hide behind  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . And anklebones take years to get well when they 've been hurt , and sometimes  --  " I straightened up and looked into her flashlight . " I talk too much when I 'm scared , too , " I said . " Do n't  --  do n't move another inch ! Who are you ? " " A bum private dick  --  detective to you . Who cares ? " I started around the car towards her . She did n't shoot . When I was six feet from her I stopped . " You stay right there ! " she snapped angrily  --  after I had stopped . " Sure . What were you looking at back there , with your windshieldspotlight ? " " A man . " " Hurt bad ? " " I 'm afraid he 's dead , " she said simply . " And you look half dead yourself . " " I 've been sapped , " I said . " It always makes me dark under the eyes . " " A nice sense of humor , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's look him over , " I said gruffly . " You can stay behind me with your popgun , if it makes you feel any safer . " " I never felt safer in my life , " she said angrily , and backed away from me . I circled the little car she had come in . An ordinary little car , nice and clean and shiny under what was left of the moon . I heard her steps behind me but I did n't pay any attention to her . About halfway up the slope a few feet off to the side I saw his foot . I put my own little flash on him and then the girl added hers . I saw him all . He was smeared to the ground , on his back , at the base of a bush . He was in that bag-of-clothes position that always means the same thing . The girl did n't speak . She kept away from me and breathed hard and held her light as steadily as any tough old homicide veteran . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fingers were curled . The other hand was under him and his overcoat was twisted as though he had been thrown out and rolled . His thick blond hair was matted with blood , black as shoe polish under the moon , and there was more of it on his face and there was a gray ooze mixed in with the blood . I did n't see his hat . Then was when I ought to have got shot . Up to that instant I had n't even thought of the packet of money in my pocket . The thought came to me so quickly now , jarred me so hard , that I jammed a hand down into my pocket . It must have looked exactly like a hand going for a gun . The pocket was quite empty . I took the hand out and looked back at her . " Mister , " she half sighed , " if I had n't made my mind up about your face  --  " " I had ten grand , " I said . " It was his money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay-off . I just remembered the money . And you 've got the sweetest set of nerves I ever met on a woman . I did n't kill him . " " I did n't think you killed him , " she said . " Somebody hated him to smash his head open like that . " " I had n't known him long enough to hate him , " I said . " Hold the flash down again . " I knelt and went through his pockets , trying not to move him much . He had loose silver and bills , keys in a tooled leather case ,  |p180the  usual billfold with the usual window for a driver 's licence and the usual insurance cards behind the licence . No money in the folder . I wondered why they had missed his trouser pockets . Panicked by the light , perhaps . Otherwise they 'd have stripped him down to his coat lining . I held more stuff up in her light : two fine handkerchiefs as white and crisp as dry snow ; half a dozen paper match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as heavy as a buggy weight and full of his imported straight-cuts ; another cigarette case , with a tortoise-shell frame and embroidered silk sides , each side a writhing dragon . I tickled the catch open and there were three long cigarettes under the elastic , Russians , with hollow mouthpieces . I pinched one . It felt old , dry . " Maybe for ladies , " I said . " He smoked others . " " Or maybe jujus , " the girl said behind me , breathing on my neck . " I knew a lad who smoked them once . Could I look ? " I passed the case up to her and she poked her flash into it until I growled at her to put it on the ground again . There was n't anything else to examine . She snapped the case shut and handed it back and I put it in his breast pocket . " That 's all . Whoever tapped him down was afraid to wait and clean up . Thanks . " I stood up casually and turned and speared the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did n't have to get rough ! " she snapped . " Give , " I said . " Who are you , and how come you ride around this place at midnight ? " She pretended I had hurt her hand , put the flash on it and looked at it carefully . " I 've been nice to you , have n't I ? " she complained . " I 'm burning up with curiosity and scared and I have n't asked you a single question , have I ? " " You 've been swell , " I said . " But I 'm in a spot where I ca n't fool around . Who are you ? And douse the flash now . We do n't need light any more . " She put it out and the darkness lightened for us gradually until we could see the outlines of the bushes and the dead man 's sprawled body and the glare in the southeastern sky that would be Santa Monica . " My name is Carol Pride , " she said . " I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper syndicate . Sometimes I ca n't get sleepy at night and I go out riding  --  just anywhere . I know all this country like a book . I saw your little light flickering around down in the hollow and it seemed to me it was pretty cold for young love  --  if they use lights . " " I would n't know , " I said . " I never did . So you have spare clips for this gun . Would you have a permit for it ? " I hefted the little weapon . It felt like a Colt .25 in the dark . It had a nice balance for a small gun . Plenty of good men have been put to sleep with .25 'S . " Certainly I have a permit . That was just bluff about the spare clips though . " " Not afraid of things are you , Miss Pride ? Or would it be Mrs. ? " " No , it would n't . . . . This neighborhood is n't dangerous . Peopledo n't even lock their doors around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get wise how lonely it is . " I turned the little gun around and held it out . " Here . It 's not my night to be clever . Now if you 'll be good enough to ride me down to Castellamare , I 'll take my car there and go find some law . " " Should n't somebody stay with him ? " I looked at the radiolite dial of my wrist watch . " It 's a quarter to one , " I said . " We 'll leave him with the crickets and the stars . Let 's go . " She tucked the gun in her bag and we went back down the slope and got into her car . She jockeyed it around without lights and drove it back up the slope . The big black car looked like a monument standing there behind us . At the top of the rise I got out and dragged the section of white barricade back into position across the road . He was safe for the night now , and likely enough for many nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the first house . Then she put the lights on and said quietly : " There 's blood on your face , Mr. Whatever-Your-Name-Is , and I never saw a man who needed a drink worse . Why not go back to my house and phone West Los Angeles from there ? There 's nothing but a fire station in this neighborhood . " " John Dalmas is the name , " I said . " I like the blood on my face . You would n't want to be mixed up in a mess like this . I wo n't even mention you . "  |p182She  said : " I 'm an orphan and live all alone . It would n't matter in the slightest . " " Just keep going down to the beach , " I said . " I 'll play it solo after that . " But we had to stop once before we got to Castellamare . The movement of the car made me go off into the weeds and be sick again . When we came to the place where my car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good night to her and sat in the Chrysler until I could n't see her taillights any more . The sidewalk cafe was still open . I could have gone in there and had a drink and phoned . But it seemed smarter to do what I did half an hour later  --  walk into the West Los Angeles Police Station cold sober and green , with the blood still on my face . Cops are just people . And their whisky is just as good as what they push across bars at you . I DID N'T tell it well . It tasted worse all the time . Reavis , the man who came out from the downtown homicide bureau , listened to me with his eyes on the floor , and two plainclothes men lounged behind him like a bodyguard . A prowl-car unit had gone out long before to guard the body . Reavis was a thin , narrow-faced , quiet man about fifty , with smooth gray skin and immaculate clothes . His trousers had a knifeedgecrease and he pulled them up carefully after he sat down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on new ten minutes ago and his hat looked as if he had bought it on the way over . We were in the day captain 's room at the West Los Angeles Police Station , just off Santa Monica Boulevard , near Sawtelle . There were just the four of us in it . Some drunk in a cell , waiting to go down to the city drunk tank for sunrise court , kept giving the Australian bush call all the time we were talking . " So I was his bodyguard for the evening , " I said at the end . " And a sweet job I made of it . " " I would n't give any thought to that , " Reavis said carelessly . " Itp183could happen to anybody . Seems to me they took you for this Lindley Paul , slugged you to save argument and to get plenty of tune , perhaps did n't have the stuff with them at all and did n't mean to give it up so cheap . When they found you were not Paul they got sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a gun , " I said . " A swell Luger , but two shotguns staring at you do n't make you warlike . " " About this darktown brother , " Reavis said . He reached for a phone on the desk . " Just a voice in the dark . I could n't be sure . " " Yeah , but we 'll find out what he was doing about that time . Lou Lid . A name that would linger . " He lifted the phone off its cradle and told the PBX man : " Desk at headquarters , Joe . . . . This is Reavis out in West L.A. on that stick-up murder . I want a Negro or half-Negro gunman name of Lou Lid . About twenty-two to twenty-four , a lightish brown , neatappearing , small , say one hundred thirty , cast in one eye , I forget which . There 's something on him , but not much , and he 's been in and out plenty times . The boys at Seventy-seventh will know him . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad an hour , then put him on the air . " He cradled the phone and winked at me . " We got the best shine clicks west of Chicago . If he 's in town , they 'll pick him off without even looking . Will we move out there now ? " We went downstairs and got into a squad car and went back through Santa Monica to the Palisades . Hours later , in the cold gray dawn , I got home . I was guzzling aspirin and whisky and bathing the back of my head with very hot water when my phone jangled . It was Reavis . " Well , we got Lou Lid , " he said . " Pasadena got him and a Mex named Fuente . Picked them up on Arroyo Seco Boulevard  --  not exactly with shovels , but kind of careful . " " Go on , " I said , holding the phone tight enough to crack it , " give me the punch line . " " You guessed it already . They found them under the Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old wire . And smashed like ripe oranges . Like it ? " I breathed hard . " It 's just what I needed to make me sleep like a baby , " I said . The hard concrete pavement of Arroyo Seco Boulevard is somep184seventy-five feet directly below Colorado Street Bridge  --  sometimes also known as Suicide Bridge . " Well , " Reavis said after a pause , " it looks like you bit into somethingrotten . What do you say now ? " " Just for a quick guess I 'd say an attempted hijack of the pay-off money by a couple of smart-alecks that got a lead to it somehow , picked their own spot and got smeared with the cash . " " That would need inside help , " Reavis said . " You mean guys that knew the beads were taken , but did n't have them . I like better that they tried to leave town with the whole take instead of passing it to the boss . Or even that the boss thought he had too many mouths to feed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drank enough whisky to kill the pain in my head . Which was more than was good for me . I got down to the office late enough to be elegant , but not feeling that way . Two stitches in the back of my scalp had begun to draw and the tape over the shaved place felt as hot as a bartender 's bunion . My office was two rooms hard by the coffee-shop smell of the Mansion House Hotel . The little one was a reception room I always left unlocked for a client to go in and wait , in case I had a client and he wanted to wait . Carol Pride was in there , sniffing at the faded red davenport , the two odd chairs , the small square of carpet and the boy's-size library table with the pre-Repeal magazines on it . She wore brownish speckled tweeds with wide lapels and a mannishshirt and tie , nice shoes , a black hat that might have cost twenty dollars for all I knew , and looked as if you could have made it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you do get up , " she said . " That 's nice to know . I was beginning to think perhaps you did all your work in bed . " " Tut , tut , " I said . " Come into my boudoir . " I unlocked the communicating door , which looked better than just kicking the lock lightly  --  which had the same effect  --  and we went into the rest of the suite , which was a rust-red carpet with plenty of ink on it , five green filing cases , three of them full of Californiaclimate , an advertising calendar showing the Dionne quintupletsrolling around on a sky-blue floor , a few near walnut chairs ,  |p185and  the usual desk with the usual heel marks on it and the usual squeaky swivel chair behind it . I sat down in that and put my hat on the telephone . I had n't really seen her before , even by the lights down at Castellamare . She looked about twenty-six and as if she had n't slept very well . She had a tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather narrow forehead with more height than is considered elegant , a small inquisitive nose , an upper lip a shade too long and a mouth more than a shade too wide . Her eyes could be very blue if they tried . She looked quiet , but not mousy-quiet . She looked smart , but not Hollywood-smart . " I read it in the evening paper that comes out in the morning , " she said . " What there was of it . " " And that means the law wo n't break it as a big story . They 'd have held it for the morning sheets . " " Well , anyhow , I 've been doing a little work on it for you , " she said . I stared hard at her , poked a flat box of cigarettes across the desk , and filled my pipe . " You 're making a mistake , " I said . " I 'm not on this case . I ate my dirt last night and banged myself to sleep with a bottle . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " she said . " Not all of it . And anyway you have to earn your fee . Or did n't you get a fee ? " " Fifty bucks , " I said . " I 'll return it when I know who to return it to . Even my mother would n't think I earned it . " " I like you , " she said . " You look like a guy who was almost a heel and then something stopped him  --  just at the last minute . Do you know who that jade necklace belonged to ? " I sat up with a jerk that hurt . " What jade necklace ? " I almost yelled . I had n't told her anything about a jade necklace . There had n't been anything in the paper about a jade necklace . " You do n't have to be clever . I 've been talking to the man on the case  --  Lieutenant Reavis . I told him about last night . I get along with policemen . He thought I knew more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well  --  who does it belong to ? " I asked , after a heavy silence . " A Mrs. Philip Courtney Prendergast , a lady who lives in BeverlyHills  --  part of the year at least . Her husband has a million orso and a bad liver . Mrs. Prendergast is a black-eyed blonde whop186goes places while Mr. Prendergast stays home and takes calomel . " " Blondes do n't like blonds , " I said . " Lindley Paul was as blond as a Swiss yodeler . " " Do n't be silly . That comes of reading movie magazines . This blonde liked that blond . I know . The society editor of the Chronicletold me . He weighs two hundred pounds and has a mustache and they call him Giddy Gertie . " " He tell you about the necklace ? " " No . The manager of Blocks Jewelry Company told me about that . I told him I was doing an article on rare jade  --  for the Police Gazette . Now you 've got me doing the wisecracks . " I lit my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly fell over backwards . " Reavis knows all this ? " I asked , trying to stare at her without seeming to . " He did n't tell me he did . He can find out easily enough . I 've no doubt he will . He 's nobody 's fool . " " Except yours , " I said . " Did he tell you about Lou Lid and Fuente the Mex ? " " No . Who are they ? " I told her about them . " Why , that 's terrible , " she said , and smiled . " Your old man was n't a cop by any chance , was he ? " I asked suspiciously . " Police Chief of Pomona for almost fifteen years . " I did n't say anything . I remembered that Police Chief John Pride of Pomona had been shot dead by two kid bandits about four years before . After a while I said : " I should have thought of that . All right , what next ? " " I 'll lay you five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that her bilious husband has enough drag to keep that part of the story and their name out of the papers , and that she needs a nice detective to help her get straightened out  --  without any scandal . " " Why scandal ? " " Oh , I do n't know . She 's the type that would have a basket of it in her dressing room . " " I suppose you had breakfast with her , " I said . " What time did you get up ? "  | " No , I ca n't see her till two o'clock . I got up at six . " " My God , " I said , and got a bottle out of the deep drawer of my desk . " My head hurts me something terrible . " " Just one , " Carol Pride said sharply . " And only because you were beaten up . But I daresay that happens quite often . " I put the drink inside me , corked the bottle but not too tightly , and drew a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " There 's something else . But maybe you ought to handle this part of it yourself . " " It 's nice to know I 'm still working here , " I said . She rolled three long Russian cigarettes across the desk . She did n't smile . " Look inside the mouthpieces , " she said , " and draw your own conclusions . I swiped them out of that Chinese case last night . They all have that something to make you wonder . " " And you a cop 's daughter , " I said . She stood up , wiped a little pipe ash off the edge of my desk with her bag and went towards the door . " I 'm a woman too . Now I 've got to go see another society editor and find out more about Mrs. Philip Courtney Prendergast and her love life . Fun , is n't it ? " The office door and my mouth shut at about the same moment . I picked up one of the Russian cigarettes . I pinched it between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be something rolled up in there , like a piece of paper or card , something that would n't have improved the drawing of the cigarette . I finally managed to dig it out with the nail-file blade of my pocketknife . It was a card all right , a thin ivory calling card , man 's size . Three words were engraved on it , nothing else . Soukesian the PsychicI looked into the other mouthpiece , found identical cards in each of them . It did n't mean a thing to me . I had never heard of Soukesianthe Psychic . After a while I looked him up in the phone book . There was a man named Soukesian on West Seventh . It sounded Armenian so I looked him up again under Oriental Rugs in the classified section . He was there all right , but that did n't prove anything . You do n't have to be a psychic to sell oriental rugs . You only have to be a psychic to buy them . And something told me thisp188Soukesian on the card did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough idea what his racket would be and what kind of people would be his customers . And the bigger he was the less he would advertise . If you gave him enough time and paid him enough , he would cure anything from a tired husband to a grasshopperplague . He would be an expert in frustrated women , in tricky , tangled , love affairs , in wandering boys who had n't written home , in whether to sell the property now or hold it another year , in whether this part will hurt my type with my public or improve it . Even men would go to him  --  guys who bellowed like bulls around their own offices and were all cold mush inside just the same . But most of all , women  --  women with money , women with jewels , women who could be twisted like silk thread around a lean Asiatic finger . I refilled my pipe and shook my thoughts around without moving my head too much , and fished for a reason why a man would carry a spare cigarette case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in each of those three cigarettes the name of another man concealed . Who would find that name ? I pushed the bottle to one side and grinned . Anyone would find those cards who went through Lindley Paul 's pockets with a finetoothcomb  --  carefully and taking time . Who would do that ? A cop . And when ? If Mr. Lindley Paul died or was badly hurt in mysterious circumstances . I took my hat off the telephone and called a man named Willy Peters who was in the insurance business , so he said , and did a sidelineselling unlisted telephone numbers bribed from maids and chauffeurs . His fee was five bucks . I figured Lindley Paul could afford it out of his fifty . Willy Peters had what I wanted . It was a Brentwood Heights number . I called Reavis down at headquarters . He said everything was fine except his sleeping time and for me just to keep my mouth shut and not worry , but I ought really to have told him about the girl . I said that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be so keen to have a lot of camera hounds jumping out at her . He said he had and the case did n't make me look very good but it could happen to anyone and so long . I called Violets M'Gee to ask him to lunch some day when he hadp189just had his teeth cleaned and his mouth was sore . But he was up in Ventura returning a prisoner . Then I called the Brentwood Heights number of Soukesian the Psychic . After a while a slightly foreign woman 's voice said : " ' Allo . " " May I speak to Mr. Soukesian ? " " I am ver-ry sor-ry . Soukesian he weel never speak upon the telephone . I am hees secretar-ry . Weel I take the message ? " " Yeah . Got a pencil ? " " But of course I ' ave the pencil . The message , eef you please ? " I gave her my name and address and occupation and telephone number first . I made sure she had them spelled right . Then I said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindley Paul . It happened last night down on the Palisades near Santa Monica . I'd-like to consultMr . Soukesian . " " He weel be ver-ry pleased . " Her voice was as calm as an oyster . " But of course I can not give you the appointment today . Soukesian he ees always ver-ry busy . Per'aps tomorrow  --  " " Next week will be fine , " I said heartily . " There 's never any hurry about a murder investigation . Just tell him I 'll give him two hours before I go to the police with what I know . " There was a silence . Maybe a breath caught sharply and maybe it was just wire noise . Then the slow foreign voice said : " I weel tell him . I do not understand  --  " " Give it the rush , angel . I 'll be waiting in my office . " I hung up , fingered the back of my head , put the three cards away in my wallet and felt as if I could eat some hot food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He smelled clear across my little reception room when I heard the outer door open and got up to see who it was . He stood just inside the door looking as if he had been cast in bronze . He was a big man from the waist up and had a big chest . Apart from that he looked like a bum . He wore a brown suit , too small for him . His hat was at least two sizes too small , and had been perspired in freely by someone it fitted better than it fitted him . Hep190wore it about where a house wears a weathercock . His collar had the snug fit of a horse collar and was about the same shade of dirty brown . A tie dangled from it , outside his buttoned coat , and had apparently been tied with a pair of pliers in a knot the size of a pea . Around his bare throat above the collar he wore what looked like a piece of black ribbon . He had a big , flat face , a big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prow of a cruiser . He had lidless eyes , drooping jowls , the shoulders of a blacksmith . If he had been cleaned up a little and dressed in a white nightgown , he would have looked like a very wicked Roman senator . His smell was the earthy smell of the primitive man ; dirty , but not the dirt of cities . " Huh , " he said . " Come quick . Come now . " I jerked my thumb at the inner office and went back into it . He followed me ponderously and made as much noise walking as a fly makes . I sat down behind my desk , pointed at the chair opposite , but he did n't sit down . His small black eyes were hostile . " Come where ? " I wanted to know . " Huh . Me Second Harvest . Me Hollywood Indian . " " Take a chair , Mr. Harvest . " He snorted and his nostrils got very wide . They had been wide enough for mouseholes in the first place . " Name Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want ? " " He say come quick . Big white father say come now . He say - " " Do n't give me any more of that pig Latin , " I said . " I 'm no schoolmarm at the snake dances . " " Nuts , " he said . He removed his hat with slow disgust and turned it upside down . He rolled a finger around under the sweatband . That turned the sweatband up into view . He removed a paper clip from the edge of the leather and moved near enough to throw a dirty fold of tissue paper on the desk . He pointed at it angrily . His lank , greasy black hair had a shelf all around it , high up , from the too-tight hat . I unfolded the bit of tissue paper and found a card which read : Soukesian the Psychic . It was in thin script , nicely engraved . I had three just like it in my wallet . I played with my empty pipe , stared at the Indian , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What does he want ? "  | " He want you come now . Quick . " " Nuts , " I said . The Indian liked that . That was the fraternity grip . He almost grinned . " It will cost him a hundred bucks as a retainer , " I added . " Huh ? " " Hundred dollars . Iron men . Bucks to the number one hundred . Me no money , me no come . Savvy ? " I began to count by opening and closing both fists . The Indian tossed another fold of tissue paper on the desk . I unfoldedit . It contained a brand-new hundred-dollar bill . " Psychic is right , " I said . " A guy that smart I 'm scared of , but I 'll go nevertheless . " The Indian put his hat back on his head without bothering to fold the sweatband under . It looked only very slightly more comical that way . I took a gun from under my arm , not the one I had had the night before unfortunately  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heel of my hand , rammed it home again , fiddled with the safety and put the gun back in its holster . This meant no more to the Indian than if I had scratched my neck . " I gottum car , " he said . " Big car . Nuts . " " Too bad , " I said . " I do n't like big cars any more . However , let 's go . " I locked up and we went out . In the elevator the Indian smelled very strong indeed . Even the elevator operator noticed it . The car was a tan Lincoln touring , not new but in good shape , with glass gypsy curtains in the back . It dipped down past a shining green polo field , zoomed up the far side , and the dark , foreignlookingdriver swung it into a narrow paved ribbon of white concretethat climbed almost as steeply as Lindley Paul 's steps , but not as straight . This was well out of town , beyond Westwood , in BrentwoodHeights . We climbed past two orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not orange country , past houses molded flat to the side of the foothills , like bas-reliefs . Then there were no more houses , just the burnt foothills and the cement ribbon and a sheer drop on the left into the coolness of a nameless canyon , and on the right heat bouncing off the seared clayp192bank at whose edge a few unbeatable wild flowers clawed and hung on like naughty children who wo n't go to bed . And in front of me two backs , a slim , whipcord back with a brown neck , black hair , a vizored cap on the black hair , and a wide , untidy back in an old brown suit with the Indian 's thick neck and heavy head above that , and on his head the ancient greasy hat with the sweatband still showing . Then the ribbon of road twisted into a hairpin , the big tires skidded on loose stones , and the tan Lincoln tore through an open gate and up a steep drive lined with pink geraniums growing wild . At the top of the drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hilltop house of white plaster and glass and chromium , as modernistic as a fluoroscope and as remote as a lighthouse . The car reached the top of the driveway , turned , stopped before a blank white wall in which there was a black door . The Indian got out , glared at me . I got out , nudging the gun against my side with the inside of my left arm . The black door in the white wall opened slowly , untouched from outside , and showed a narrow passage ending far back . A bulb glowed in the ceiling . The Indian said : " Huh . Go in , big shot . " " After you , Mr. Harvest . " He went in scowling and I followed him and the black door closed noiselessly of itself behind us . A bit of mumbo-jumbo for the customers . At the end of the narrow passage there was an elevator . I had to get into it with the Indian . We went up slowly , with a gentle purring sound , the faint hum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a whisper and there was daylight . I got out of the elevator . It dropped down again behind me with the Indian still in it . I was in a turret room that was almost all windows , some of them close-draped against the afternoon glare . The rugs on the floor had the soft colors of old Persians , and there was a desk made of carved panels that probably came out of a church . And behind the desk there was a woman smiling at me , a dry , tight , withered smile that would turn to powder if you touched it . She had sleek , black , coiled hair , a dark Asiatic face . There were pearls in her ears and rings on her fingers , large , rather cheap rings , including a moonstone and a square-cut emerald that looked asp193phony as a ten-cent-store slave bracelet . Her hands were little and dark and not young and not fit for rings . " Ah , Meester Dalmas , so ver-ry good of you to come . Soukesian he weel be so pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the new hundred-dollar bill out of my wallet and laid it on her desk , in front of her dark , glittering hands . She did n't touch it or look at it . " My party , " I said . " But thanks for the thought . " She got up slowly , without moving the smile , swished around the desk in a tight dress that fitted her like a mermaid 's skin , and showed that she had a good figure , if you liked them four sizes bigger below the waist than above it . " I weel conduct you , " she said . She moved before me to a narrow panelled wall , all there was of the room besides the windows and the tiny elevator shaft . She opened a narrow door beyond which there was a silky glow that did n't seem to be daylight . Her smile was older than Egypt now . I nudged my gun holster again and went in . The door shut silently behind me . The room was octagonal , draped in black velvet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the black rug there stood a white octagonal table , and on either side of that a stool that was a smaller edition of the table . Over against the black drapes there was one more such stool . There was a large milky ball on a black stand on the white table . The light came from this . There was nothing else in the room . I stood there for perhaps fifteen seconds , with that obscure feeling of being watched . Then the velvet drapes parted and a man came into the room and walked straight over to the other side of the table and sat down . Only then did he look at me . He said : " Be seated opposite me , please . Do not smoke and do not move around or fidget , if you can avoid it . How may I serve you ? " HE was a tall man , straight as steel , with the blackest eyes I had ever seen and the palest and finest blond hair I had ever seen . He might have been thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anp194Armenian than I did . His hair was brushed straight back from as good a profile as John Barrymore had at twenty-eight . A matinee idol , and I expected something furtive and dark and greasy that rubbed its hands . He wore a black double-breasted business suit cut like nobody 's business , a white shirt , a black tie . He was as neat as a gift book . I gulped and said : " I do n't want a reading . I know all about this stuff . " " Yes ? " he said delicately . " And what do you know about it ? " " Let it pass , " I said . " I can figure the secretary because she 's a sweet buildup for the shock people get when they see you . The Indian stumps me a bit , but it 's none of my business anyhow . I 'm not a bunko squad cop . What I came about is a murder . " " The Indian happens to be a natural medium , " Soukesian said mildly . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are sometimes found in dirty places . That might not interest you either . As to the murder you may inform me . I never read the papers . " " Come , come , " I said . " Not even to see who 's pulling the big checks at the front office ? Oke , here it is . " And I laid it in front of him , the whole damn story , and about his cards and where they had been found . He did n't move a muscle . I do n't mean that he did n't scream or wave his arms or stamp on the floor or bite his nails . I mean he simply did n't move at all , not even an eyelid , not even an eye . He just sat there and looked at me , like a stone lion outside the Public Library . When I was all done he put his finger right down on the spot . " You kept those cards from the police ? Why ? " " You tell me . I just did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not nearly enough . " " That 's an idea too , " I said . " But I had n't really got around to playing with it . " He moved enough to fold his arms . His black eyes were as shallow as a cafeteria tray or as deep as a hole to China  --  whichever you like . They did n't say anything , either way . He said : " You would n't believe me if I said I only knew this man in the most casual manner  --  professionally ? " " I 'd take it under advisement , " I said.  | " I take it you have n't much faith in me . Perhaps Mr. Paul had . Was anything on those cards besides my name ? " " Yeah , " I said . " And you would n't like it . " This was kindergartenstuff , the kind the cops pull on radio crime dramatizations. 1Ie let it go without even looking at it . " I 'm in a sensitive profession , " he said . " Even in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . " " I was kidding you , " I said . " There 's nothing on them but your name . " I got my wallet out and withdrew one card and laid it in front of him . I put the wallet away . He turned the card over with a fingernail . " You know what I figure ? " I said heartily . " I figure Lindley Paul thought you would be able to find out who did him in , even if the police could n't . Which means he was afraid of somebody . " Soukesian unfolded his arms and folded them the other way . With him that was probably equivalent to climbing up the light fixture and biting off a bulb . " You do n't think anything of the sort , " he said . " How much  --  quickly  --  for the three cards and a signed statement that you searched the body before you notified the police ? " " Not bad , " I said , " for a guy whose brother is a rug peddler . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice about his smile . " There are honest rug dealers , " he said . " But Arizmian Soukesian is not my brother . Ours is a common name in Armenia . " I nodded . " You think I 'm just another faker , of course , " he added . " Go ahead and prove you 're not . " " Perhaps it is not money you want after all , " he said carefully . " Perhaps it is n't . " I did n't see him move his foot , but he must have touched a floor button . The black velvet drapes parted and the Indian came into the room . He did n't look dirty or funny any more . He was dressed in loose white trousers and a white tunic embroideredin black . There was a black sash around his waist and a black fillet around his forehead . His black eyes were sleepy . He shuffled over to the stool beside the drapes and sat down and folded his arms and leaned his head on his chest . He looked bulkier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . Soukesian held his hands above the milky globe that was betweenp196us on the white table . The light on the remote black ceiling was broken and began to weave into odd shapes and patterns , very faint because the ceiling was black . The Indian kept his head low and his chin on his chest but his eyes turned up slowly and stared at the weaving hands . The hands moved in a swift , graceful , intricate pattern that meant anything or nothing , that was like Junior Leaguers doing Greek dances , or coils of Christmas ribbon tossed on the floor  --  whatever you liked . The Indian 's solid jaw rested on his solid chest and slowly , like a toad 's eyes , his eyes shut . " I could have hypnotized him without all that , " Soukesian said softly . " It 's merely part of the show . " " Yeah . " I watched his lean , firm throat . " Now , something Lindley Paul touched , " he said . " This card will do . " He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the card inside the fillet against the Indian 's forehead , left it there . He sat down again . He began to mutter softly in a guttural language I did n't know . I watched his throat . The Indian began to speak . He spoke very slowly and heavily , between motionless lips , as though the words were heavy stones he had to drag up hill in a blazing hot sun . " Lindley Paul bad man . Make love to squaw of chief . Chief very angry . Chief have necklace stolen . Lindley Paul have to get um back . Bad man kill . Grrrr . " The Indian 's head jerked as Soukesian clapped his hands . The little lidless black eyes snapped open again . Soukesian looked at me with no expression at all on his handsome face . " Neat , " I said . " And not a darn bit gaudy . " I jerked a thumb at the Indian . " He 's a bit heavy to sit on your knee , is n't he ? I have n't seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Soukesian smiled very faintly . " I watched your throat muscles , " I said . " No matter . I guess I get the idea . Paul had been cutting corners with somebody 's wife . The somebody was jealous enough to have him put away . It has points , as a theory . Because this jade necklace she was wearingp197would n't be worn often and somebody had to know she was wearing it that particular night when the stick-up was pulled off . A husband would know that . " " It is quite possible , " Soukesian said . " And since you were not killed perhaps it was not the intent to kill Lindley Paul . Merely to beat him up . " " Yeah , " I said . " And here 's another idea . I ought to have had it before . If Lindley Paul really did fear somebody and wanted to leave a message , then there might still be something written on those cards  --  in invisible ink . " That got to him . His smile hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at first . The time was short for me to judge that . The light inside the milky globe suddenly went out . Instantly the room was pitch dark . You could n't see your own hand . I kicked my stool back and jerked my gun free and started to back away . A rush of air brought a strong earthy smell with it . It was uncanny . Without the slightest error of timing or space , even in that complete blackness , the Indian hit me from behind and pinned my arms . He started to lift me . I could have jerked a hand up and fanned the room in front of me with blind shots . I did n't try . There was n't any point in it . The Indian lifted me with his two hands holding my arms against my sides as though a steam crane was lifting me . He set me down again , hard , and he had my wrists . He had them behind me , twistingthem . A knee like the corner of a foundation stone went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my throat and could n't get out . The Indian threw me sideways , wrapped my legs with his legs as we fell , and had me in a barrel . I hit the floor hard , with part of his weight on me . I still had the gun . The Indian did n't know I had it . At least he did n't act as if he knew . It was jammed down between us . I started to turn it . The light flicked on again . Soukesian was standing beyond the white table , leaning on it . He looked older . There was something on his face I did n't like . He looked like a man who had something to do he did n't relish , but was going to do it all the same.  | " So , " he said softly . " Invisible writing . " Then the curtains swished apart and the thin dark woman rushed into the room with a reeking white cloth in her hands and slapped it around my face , leaning down to glare at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me , straining at my arms . I had to breathe the chloroform . There was too much weight dragging my throat tight . The thick , sweetish reek of it ate into me . I went away from there . Just before I went somebody fired a gun twice . The sound did n't seem to have anything to do with me . I was lying out in the open again , just like the night before . This time it was daylight and the sun was burning a hole in my right leg . I could see the hot blue sky , the lines of a ridge , scrub oak , yuccas in bloom spouting from the side of a hill , more hot blue sky . I sat up . Then my left leg began to tingle with tiny needle points . I rubbed it . I rubbed the pit of my stomach . The chloroform stank in my nose . I was as hollow and rank as an old oil drum . I got up on my feet , but did n't stay there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , more chills , and my stomachhurt worst . I got back up on my feet . The breeze off the ocean lifted up the slope and put a little frail life into me . I staggered around dopily and looked at some tire marks on red clay , then at a big galvanized-iron cross , once white but with the paint flaked off badly . It was studded with empty sockets for light bulbs , and its base was of cracked concrete with an open door , inside which a verdigris-coated copper switch showed . Beyond this concrete base I saw the feet . They stuck out casually from under a bush . They were in hardtoedshoes , the kind college boys used to wear about the year before the war . I had n't seen shoes like that for years , except once . I went over there and parted the bushes and looked down at the Indian . His broad , blunt hands lay at his sides , large and empty and limp . There were bits of clay and dead leaf and wild oyster-plant seeds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along his brown cheek . On his stomach the flies had found a sodden patch of blood . His eyes were like other eyes I had seen  --  too many of them  --  half open , clear , but the play behind them was over.  |p199He  had his comic street clothes on again and his greasy hat lay near him , with the sweatband still wrong side out . He was n't funny any more , or tough , or nasty . He was just a poor simple dead guy who had never known what it was all about . I had killed him , of course . Those were my shots I had heard , from my gun . I did n't find the gun . I went through my clothes . The other two Soukesian cards were missing . Nothing else . I followed the tire tracks to a deeply rutted road and followed that down the hill . Cars glittered by far below as the sunlight caught their windshields or the curve of a headlight . There was a service station and a few houses down there too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the long curve of the shore line towards Point Firmin . It was a little hazy . I could n't see Catalina Island . The people I was dealing with seemed to like operating in that part of the country . It took me half an hour to reach the service station . I phoned for a taxi and it had to come from Santa Monica . I drove all the way home to my place in the Berglund , three blocks above the office , changed clothes , put my last gun in the holster and sat down to the phone . Soukesian was n't home . Nobody answered that number . Carol Pride did n't answer her number . I did n't expect her to . She was probably having tea with Mrs. Philip Courtney Prendergast . But police headquarters answered their number , and Reavis was still on the job . He did n't sound pleased to hear from me . " Anything new on the Lindley Paul killing ? " I asked him . " I thought I told you to forget it . I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me all light , but it keeps worrying at me . I like a clean job . I think her husband had it done . " He was silent for a moment . Then , " Whose husband , smart boy ? " " The husband of the frail that lost the jade beads , naturally . " " And of course you 've had to poke your face into who she is . " " It sort of drifted to me , " I said . " I just had to reach out . " He was silent again . This time so long that I could hear theloudspeaker on his wall put out a police bulletin on a stolen car . Then he said very smoothly and distinctly : " I 'd like to sell youan idea , shamus . Maybe I can . There 's a lot of peace of mind in it.  |p200The  Police Board gave you a licence once and the sheriff gave you a special badge . Any acting captain with a peeve can get both of them taken away from you overnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what did you have when you got that licence and that badge ? Do n't answer , I 'm telling you . You had the social standing of a cockroach . You were a snooper for hire . All in the world you had to do then was to spend your last hundred bucks on a down payment on some rent and office furniture and sit on your tail until somebody brought a lion in  --  so you could put your head in the lion 's mouth to see if he would bite . If he bit your ear off , you got sued for mayhem . Are you beginning to get it ? " " It 's a good line , " I said . " I used it years ago . So you do n't want to break the case ? " " If I could trust you , I 'd tell you we want to break up a very smart jewel gang . But I ca n't trust you . Where are you  --  in a poolroom ? " " I 'm in bed , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you just fill yourself a nice hot-water bottle and put it onyour face and go to sleep like a good little boy , will you please ? " " Naw . I 'd rather go out and shoot an Indian , just for practice . " " Well , just one Indian , Junior . " " Don ' forget that bit , " I yelled , and hung the phone in his face . V I Lady in LiquorI HAD a drink on the way down to the boulevard , black coffee laced with brandy , in a place where they knew me . It made my stomach feel like new , but I still had the same shopworn head . And I could still smell chloroform in my whiskers . I went up to the office and into the little reception room . There were two of them this time , Carol Pride and a blonde . A blonde with black eyes . A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained-glass window . Carol Pride stood up and scowled at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has been waiting quite some time . And she 's not used to being kept waiting . She wants to employ you . "  |p201The  blonde smiled at me and put a gloved hand out . I touched the hand . She was perhaps thirty-five and she had that wide-eyed , dreamy expression , as far as black eyes can have it . Whatever you need , whatever you are  --  she had it . I did n't pay much attention to her clothes . They were black and white . They were what the guy had put on her and he would know or she would n't have gone to him . I unlocked the door of my private thinking-parlor and ushered them in . There was a half-empty quart of hooch standing on the corner of my desk . " Excuse me for keeping you waiting , Mrs. Prendergast , " I said . " I had to go out on a little business . " " I do n't see why you had to go out , " Carol Pride said icily . " There seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I placed chairs for them and sat down and reached for the bottle and the phone rang at my left elbow . A strange voice took its time saying : " Dalmas ? Okay . We have the gat . I guess you 'll want it back , wo n't you ? " " Both of them . I 'm a poor man . " " We only got one , " the voice said smoothly . " The one the johns would like to have . I 'll be calling you later . Think things over . " " Thanks . " I hung up and put the bottle down on the floor and smiled at Mrs. Prendergast . " I ' 11 do the talking , " Carol Pride said . " Mrs. Prendergast has a slight cold . She has to save her voice . " She gave the blonde one of those sidelong looks that women think men do n't understand , the kind that feel like a dentist 's drill . " Well  --  " Mrs. Prendergast said , and moved a little so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I had put the whisky bottle down on the carpet . " Mrs. Prendergast has taken me into her confidence , " Carol Pride said . " I do n't know why , unless it is that I have shown her where a lot of unpleasant notoriety can be avoided . " I frowned at her . " There is n't going to be any of that . I talked to Reavis a while ago . He has a hush on it that would make a dynamite explosion sound like a pawnbroker looking at a dollar watch . " " Very funny , " Carol Pride said , " for people who dabble in thatp202sort of wit . But it just happens Mrs. Prendergast would like to get her jade necklace back without Mr. Prendergast knowing it was stolen . It seems he does n't know yet . " " That 's different , " I said . ( The hell he did n't know ! ) Mrs. Prendergast gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket . " I just love straight rye , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? " I got out a couple of pony glasses and put the bottle up on the desk again . Carol Pride leaned back and lit a cigarette contemptuouslyand looked at the ceiling . She was n't so hard to look at herself . You could look at her longer without getting dizzy . But Mrs. Prendergast had it all over her for a quick smash . I poured a couple of drinks for the ladies . Carol Pride did n't touch hers at all . " In case you do n't know , " she said distantly , " Beverly Hills , where Mrs. Prendergast lives , is peculiar in some ways . They have two-way radio cars and only a small territory to cover and they cover it like a blanket , because there 's plenty of money for police protection in Beverly Hills . In the better homes they even have direct communication with headquarters , over wires that ca n't be cut . " Mrs. Prendergast put her drink to sleep with one punch and looked at the bottle . I milked it again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have photo-cell connectionson our safes and fur closets . We can fix the house so that even the servants ca n't go near certain places without police knockingat the door in about thirty seconds . Marvelous , is n't it ? " " Yes , marvelous , " Carol Pride said . " But that 's only in Beverly Hills . Once outside  --  and you ca n't spend your entire life in Beverly Hills  --  that is , unless you 're an ant  --  your jewels are not so safe . So Mrs. Prendergast had a duplicate of her jade necklace  --  in soapstone . " I sat up straighter . Lindley Paul had let something drop about it taking a lifetime to duplicate the workmanship on Fei Tsui beads  --  even if material were available . Mrs. Prendergast fiddled with her second drink , but not for long . Her smile got warmer and warmer . " So when she went to a party outside Beverly Hills , Mrs. Prendergastwas supposed to wear the imitation . That is , when she wanted to wear jade at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And he has a lousy temper , " Mrs. Prendergast said . I put some more rye under her hand . Carol Pride watched me do it and almost snarled at me : " But on the night of the holdup she made a mistake and was wearing the real one . " I leered at her . " I know what you 're thinking , " she snapped . " Who knew she had made that mistake ? It happened that Mr. Paul knew it , soon after they left the house . He was her escort . " " He  --  er  --  touched the necklace a little , " Mrs. Prendergast sighed . " He could tell real jade by the feel of it . I 've heard some people can . He knew a lot about jewels . " I leaned back again in my squeaky chair . " Hell , " I said disgustedly , " I ought to have suspected that guy long ago . The gang had to have a society finger . How else could they tell when the good things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross on them and they used this chance to put him away . " " Rather wasteful of such a talent , do n't you think ? " Carol Pride said sweetly . She pushed her little glass along the desk top with one finger . " I do n't really care for this , Mrs. Prendergast  --  if you 'd like another  --  " " Moths in your ermine , " Mrs. Prendergast said , and threw it clown the hatch . " Where and how was the stick-up ? " I rapped . " Well , that seems a little funny too , " Carol Pride said , beating Mrs. Prendergast by half a word . " After the party , which was in Brentwood Heights , Mr. Paul wanted to drop in at the Trocadero . They were in his car . At that time they were widening Sunset Boulevard all through the County Strip , if you remember . After they had killed a little time at the Troc  --  " " And a few snifters , " Mrs. Prendergast giggled , reaching for the bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the whisky went into the glass.  --  Mr. Paul drove her home by way of Santa Monica Boule-ard . " " That was the natural way to go , " I said . " Almost the only way to go unless you wanted a lot of dust . " " Yes , but it also took them past a certain down-at-the-heels hotel ( ailed the Tremaine and a beer parlor across the street from it . Mrs. Prendergast noticed a car pull away from in front of the beer parlor and follow them . She 's pretty sure it was that same car thatp204crowded them to the curb a little later  --  and the holdup men knew just what they wanted . Mrs. Prendergast remembers all this very well . " " Well , naturally , " Mrs. Prendergast said . " You do n't mean I was drunk , I hope . This baby carries her hooch . You do n't lose a string of beads like that every night . " She put her fifth drink down her throat . " I would n't know a darn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told me a little thickly . " Lin  --  tha 's Mr. Paul  --  I called him Lin , y'know , felt kinda bad about it . That 's why he stuck his neck out . " " It was your money  --  the ten thousand for the pay-off ? " I asked her . " It was n't the butler 's , honey . And I want those beads back beforeCourt gets wise . How about lookin ' over that beer parlor ? " She grabbled around in her black and white bag and pushed some bills across the desk in a lump . I straightened them out and counted them . They added to four hundred and sixty-seven dollars . Nice money . I let them lie . " Mr. Prendergast , " Carol Pride ploughed on sweetly , " whom Mrs. Prendergast calls Court , ' thinks the imitation necklace was taken . He ca n't tell one from the other , it seems . He does n't know anything about last night except that Lindley Paul was killed by some bandits . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud this time , and sourly . I pushed the money back across the desk . " I believe you think you 're being blackmailed , Mrs. Prendergast . You 're wrong . I think the reason this story has n't broken in the press the way it happened is because pressure has been brought on the police . They 'd be willing anyhow , because what they want is the jewel gang . The punks that killed Paul are dead already . " Mrs. Prendergast stared at me with a hard , bright , alcoholic stare . " I had n't the slightest idea of bein ' blackmailed , " she said . She was having trouble with her s 's now . " I want my beads and I want them quick . It 's not a question of money . Not ' tall . Gim me a drink . " " It 's in front of you , " I said . She could drink herself under the desk for all I cared . Carol Pride said : " Do n't you think you ought to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? "  | " A piece of chewed pretzel , " I said . " Nuts to that idea . " The blonde was waving the bottle over her two glasses . She got herself a drink poured finally , drank it , and pushed the handful of currency around on the desk with a free and easy gesture , like a kid playing with sand . I took it away from her , put it together again and went around the desk to put it back into her bag . " If I do anything , I 'll let you know , " I told her . " I do n't need a retainer from you , Mrs. Prendergast . " She liked that . She almost took another drink , thought better of it with what she still had to think with , got to her feet and started for the door . I got to her in time to keep her from opening it with her nose . I held her arm and opened the door for her and there was a uniformed chauffeur leaning against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snapped a cigarette into the distance and took hold of her . " Let 's go , baby . I ought to paddle your behind . Damned if I ought n't . " She giggled and held on to him and they went down the corridor and turned a corner out of sight . I went back into the office and sat down behind my desk and looked at Carol Pride . She was moppingthe desk with a dustcloth she had found somewhere . " You and your office bottle , " she said bitterly . Her eyes hated me . " To hell with her , " I said angrily . " I would n't trust her with my old socks . I hope she gets raped on the way home . To hell with her beer-parlor angle too . " " Her morals are neither here nor there , Mr. John Dalmas . She has pots of money and she 's not tight with it . I 've seen her husband and he 's nothing but a beanstalk with a checkbook that never runs dry . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told me she 's suspected for some time that Paul was a Raffles . She did n't care as long as he let her alone . " " This Prendergast is a prune , huh ? He would be , of course . " " Tall , thin , yellow . Looks as if his first drink of milk soured on his stomach and he could still taste it . " " Paul did n't steal her necklace . " " No ? " " No . And she did n't have any duplicate of it . "  |p206Her  eyes got narrower and darker . " I suppose Soukesian the Psychic told you all this . " " Who 's he ? " She leaned forward a moment and then leaned back and pulled her bag tight against her side . " I see , " she said slowly . " You do n't like my work . Excuse me for butting in . I thought I was helping you a little . " " I told you it was none of my business . Go on home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any help . " " I thought we were friends , " she said . " I thought you liked me . " She stared at me for a minute with bleak , tired eyes . " I 've got a living to make . I do n't make it bucking the police department . " She stood up and looked at me a moment longer without speaking . Then she went to the door and went out . I heard her steps die along the mosaic floor of the corridor . I sat there for ten or fifteen minutes almost without moving . I tried to guess why Soukesian had n't killed me . None of it made any sense . I went down to the parking lot and got into my car . THE Hotel Tremaine was far out of Santa Monica , near the junk yards . An interurban right-of-way split the street in half , and just as I got to the block that would have the number I had looked up , a two-car train came racketing by at forty-five miles an hour , makingalmost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeded up beside it and passed the block , pulled into the cement space in front of a market that had gone out of business . I got out and looked back from the corner of the wall . I could see the Hotel Tremaine 's sign over a narrow door between two store fronts , both empty  --  an old two-story walk-up . Its woodwork would smell of kerosene , its shades would be cracked , its curtains would be of sleazy cotton lace and its bedsprings would stick into your back . I knew all about places like the Hotel Tremaine , I had slept in them , staked out in them , fought with bitter ,  |p207scrawny  landladies in them , got shot at in them , and might yet get carried out of one of them to the morgue wagon . They are flops where you find the cheap ones , the sniffers and pin-jabbers , the gowed-up runts who shoot you before you can say hello . The beer parlor was on my side of the street . I went back to the Chrysler and got inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I went along the sidewalk . There was a red neon sign  --  BEER  --  over it . A wide pulled-down shade masked the front window , contrary to the law . The place was just a made-over store , half-frontage . I opened the door and went in . The barman was playing the pin game on the house 's money and a man sat on a stool with a brown hat on the back of his head reading a letter . Prices were scrawled in white on the mirror back of the bar . The bar was just a plain , heavy wooden counter , and at each end of it hung an old frontier .44 in a flimsy cheap holster no gunfighter would ever have worn . There were printed cards on the walls , about not asking for credit and what to take for a hangover and a liquor breath , and there were some nice legs in photographs . The place did n't look as if it even paid expenses . The barkeep left the pin game and went behind the bar . He was fiftyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he moved as if he had corns . The man on the stool kept right on chuckling over his letter , which was written in green ink on pink paper . The barkeep put both his blotched hands on the bar and looked at me with the expression of a dead-pan comedian , and I said : " Beer . " He drew it slowly , raking the glass with an old dinner knife . I sipped my beer and held my glass with my left hand . After a while I said : " Seen Lou Lid lately ? " This seemed to be in order . There had been nothing in any paper I had seen about Lou Lid and Fuente the Mex . The barkeep looked at me blankly . The skin over his eyes was grained like lizard skin . Finally he spoke in a husky whisper . " Do n't know him . " There was a thick white scar on his throat . A knife had gone in there once which accounted for the husky whisper  |p208The  man who was reading the letter guffawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell this to Moose , " he roared . " This is right from the bottom of the bucket . " He got down off his stool and ambled over to a door in the rear wall and went through it . He was a husky dark man who looked like anybody . The door shut behind him . The barkeep said in his husky whisper : " Lou Lid , huh ? Funny moniker . Lots a guys come in here . I du n no their names . Copper ? " " Private , " I said . " Do n't let it bother you . I 'm just drinking beer . This Lou Lid was a shine . Light brown . Young . " " Well , maybe I seen him sometime . I do n't recall . " " Who 's Moose ? " " Him ? That 's the boss . Moose Magoon . " He dipped a thick towel down in a bucket and folded it and wrung it out and pushed it along the bar holding it by the ends . That made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can knock a man into the next county with a club like that if you know how . The man with the pink letter came back through the rear door , still chuckling , shoved the letter into his side pocket and strolled to the pin game . That put him behind me . I began to get a little worried . I finished my beer quickly and stood down off the stool . The barkeep had n't rung up my dime yet . He held his twisted towel and moved it back and forth slowly . " Nice beer , " I said . " Thanks all the same . " " Come again , " he whispered , and knocked my glass over . That took my eyes for a second . When I looked up again the door at the back was open and a big man stood in it with a big gun in his hand . He did n't say anything . He just stood there . The gun looked at me . It looked like a tunnel . The man was very broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked plenty tough . He did n't look as if his real name was Magoon . Nobody said anything . The barkeep and the man with the big gun just stared at me fixedly . Then I heard a train coming on the interurban tracks . Coming fast and coming noisy . That would be the time . The shade was down all across the front window and nobody could see into the place . The train would make a lot of noise as it went by . A couple of shots would be lost in it.  |p209The  noise of the approaching train got louder . I had to move before it got quite loud enough . I went head first over the bar in a rolling dive . Something banged faintly against the roar of the train and somethingrattled overhead , seemingly on the wall . I never knew what it was . The train went on by in a booming crescendo . I hit the barkeep 's legs and the dirty floor about the same moment . He sat down on my neck . That put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears into some very hard concrete floor . My head began to howl with pain . I was low down along a sort of duckboard behind the bar and half turned on my left side . I jerked the gun loose from my waistband . For a wonder it had n't slipped and jammed itself down my trouser leg . The barkeep made a kind of annoyed sound and something hot stung me and I did n't hear any more shots just at the moment . I did n't shoot the barkeep . I rammed the gun muzzle into a part of him where some people are sensitive . He was one of them . He went up off of me like a foul fly . If he did n't yell it was not for want of trying . I rolled a little more and put the gun in the seat of his pants . " Hold it ! " I snarled at him . " I do n't want to get vulgar with you . " Two more shots roared . The train was off in the distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bar was old and solid but not solid enough to stop .45 slugs . The barkeep sighed above me . Something hot and wet fell on my face . " You 've shot me , boys , " he whispered , and started to fall down on top of me . I wriggled away just in time , got to the end of the bar nearest the front of the beer parlor and looked around it . A face with a brown hat over it was about nine inches from my own face , on the same level . We looked at each other for a fraction of a second that seemed long enough for a tree to grow to maturity in , but was actually so short a time that the barkeep was still foundering in the air behind me . This was my last gun . Nobody was going to get it . I got it up before the man I was facing had even reacted to the situation . He did n't do anything . He just slid off to one side and as he slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard this shot . It was so loud it was like the end of the world ,  |p210so  loud that I almost did n't hear the door slam towards the back . I crawled farther around the end of the bar , knocked somebody 's gun along the floor peevishly , stuck my hat around the corner of the wood . Nobody shot at it . I stuck one eye and part of my face out . The door at the back was shut and the space in front of it was empty . I got up on my knees and listened . Another door slammed , and a car motor roared . I went crazy . I tore across the room , threw the door open and plunged through it . It was a phony . They had slammed the door and started the car just for a come-on . I saw that the flailing arm held a bottle . For the third time in twenty-four hours I took the count . I came out of this one yelling , with the harsh bite of ammonia in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have anything to swing with . My arms were a couple of four-ton anchors . I threshed around and groaned . The face in front of me materialized into the bored yet attentive pan of a man with a white coat , a fast-wagon medico . " Like it ? " he grinned . " Some people used to drink it  --  with a wine-tonic chaser . " He pulled at me and something nipped at my shoulder and a needle stung me . " Light shot , " he said . " That head of yours is pretty bad . You wo n't go out . " His face went away . I prowled my eyes . Beyond there was a vagueness . Then I saw a girl 's face , hushed , sharp , attentive . Carol Pride . " Yeah , " I said . " You followed me . You would . " She smiled and moved . Then her fingers were stroking my cheek and I could n't see her . " The prowl-car boys just made it , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for shipment in a truck out back . " I could n't see very well . A big red-faced man in blue slid in front of me . He had a gun in his hand with the gate open . Somebodygroaned somewhere in the background . She said : " They had two others wrapped up . But they were dead . Ugh ! " " Go on home , " I grumbled woozily . " Go write yourself a feature story . "  | " You used that one before , sap . " She went on stroking my cheek . " I thought you made them up as you went along . Drowsy ? " " That 's all taken care of , " a new voice said sharply . " Get this shot guy down to where you can work on him . I want him to live . " Reavis came towards me as out of a mist . His face formed itself slowly , gray , attentive , rather stern . It lowered , as if he sat down in front of me , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart , " he said in a sharp , edgy voice . " All right , talk . The hell with how your head feels . You asked for it and you got it . " " Gim me a drink . " Vague motion , a flicker of bright light , the lip of a flask touched my mouth . Hot strength ran down my throat . Some of it ran cold on my chin and I moved my head away from the flask . " Thanks . Get Magoon  --  the biggest one ? " " He 's full of lead , but still turning over . On his way downtown now . " " Get the Indian ? " " Huh ? " he gulped . " In some bushes under Peace Cross down on the Palisades . I shot him . I did n't mean to . " " Holy  --  " Reavis went away again and the fingers moved slowly and rhythmicallyon my cheek . Reavis came back and sat down again . " Who 's the Indian ? " he snapped . " Soukesian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We know about him , " Reavis interrupted bitterly . " You 've been out a whole hour , shamus . The lady told us about those cards . She says it 's her fault but I do n't believe it . Screwy anyhow . But a couple of the boys have gone out there . " " I was there , " I said . " At his house . He knows something . I do n't know what . He was afraid of me  --  yet he did n't knock me off . Funny . " " Amateur , " Reavis said dryly . " He left that for Moose Magoon . Moose Magoon was tough up till lately . A record from here to Pittsburgh . . . . Here . But take it easy . This is ante mortem confessionliquor . Too damn good for you . " The flask touched my lips again.  | " Listen , " I said thickly . " This was the stick-up squad . Soukesian was the brains . Lindley Paul was the finger . He must have crossed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and just then a phone rang distantly and a voice said : " You , Lieutenant . " Reavis went away . When he came back again he did n't sit down . " Maybe you 're right , " he said softly . " Maybe you are , at that . In a house on top of a hill in Brentwood Heights there 's a goldenhairedguy dead in a chair with a woman crying over him . Dutch act . There 's a jade necklace on a table beside him . " " Too much death , " I said , and fainted . I woke up in an ambulance . At first I thought I was alone in it . Then I felt her hand and knew I was n't . I was stone blind now . I could n't even see light . It was just bandages . " The doctor 's up front with the driver , " she said . " You can hold my hand . Would you like me to kiss you ? " " If it does n't obligate me to anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll live , " she said . She kissed me . " Your hair smells of Scotch . Do you take baths in it ? The doctor said you were n't to talk . " " They beaned me with a full bottle . Did I tell Reavis about the Indian ? " " Yes . " " Did I tell him Mrs. Prendergast thought Paul was mixed up  --  " " You did n't even mention Mrs. Prendergast , " she said quickly . I did n't say anything to that . After a while she said : " ThiSoukesian , did he look like a lady 's man ? " " The doctor said I was n't to talk , " I said . IT was a couple of weeks later that I drove down to Santa Monica . Ten days of the time I had spent in the hospital , at my own expense , getting over a bad concussion . Moose Magoon was in the prison ward at the County Hospital about the same time , while they pickedp213seven or eight police slugs out of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case was pretty well buried by this time , too . The papers had had their play with it and other things had come along and after all it was just a jewel racket that went sour from too much doublecrossing . So the police said , and they ought to know . They did n't find any more jewels , but they did n't expect to . They figured the gang pulled just one job at a time , with coolie labor mostly , and sent them on their way with their cut . That way only three people really knew what it was all about : Moose Magoon , who turned out to be an Armenian ; Soukesian , who used his connections to find out who had the right kind of jewels ; and Lindley Paul , who fingered the jobs and tipped the gang off when to strike . Or so the police said , and they ought to know . It was a nice warm afternoon . Carol Pride lived on Twenty-fifth Street , in a neat little red brick house trimmed with white with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a tan figured rug , white-and-rose chairs , a black marble fireplace with tall brass andirons , very high bookcases built back into the walls , rough cream-colored drapes against shades of the same color . There was nothing womanish in it except a full-length mirror with a clear sweep of floor in front . I sat down in a nice soft chair and rested what was left of my head and sipped Scotch and soda while I looked at her fluffed-out brown hair above a high-collar dress that made her face look small ; almost childish . " I bet you did n't get all this writing , " I said . " And my dad did n't get it grafting on the cops either , " she snapped . " We had a few lots at Playa Del Rey , if you have to know . " " A little oil , " I said . " Nice . I did n't have to know . Do n't start snapping at me . " " Have you still got your licence ? " " Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch . You would n't like to go riding in an old car , would you ? " " Who am I to sneer at an old car ? " she asked . " The laundry must have put too much starch in your neck . " I grinned at the thin line between her eyebrows.  | " I kissed you in that ambulance , " she said . " If you remember , do n't take it too big . I was just sorry for the way you got your head bashed in . " " I 'm a career man , " I said . " I would n't build on anything like that . Let 's go riding . I have to see a blonde in Beverly Hills . I owe her a report . " She stood up and glared at me . " Oh , the Prendergast woman , " she said nastily . " The one with the hollow wooden legs . " " They may be hollow , " I said . She flushed and tore out of the room and came back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat that had a red button on it , and a plaid overcoat with a suede collar and cuffs . " Let 's go , " she said breathlessly . The Philip Courtney Prendergasts lived on one of those wide , curving streets where the houses seem to be too close together for their size and the amount of money they represent . A Jap gardener was manicuring a few acres of soft green lawn with the usual contemptuousexpression Jap gardeners have . The house had an Englishslate roof and a porte-cochere , some nice imported trees , a trellis with bougainvillaea . It was a nice place and not loud . But Beverly Hills is Beverly Hills , so the butler had a wing collar and an accent like Alan Mowbray . He ushered us through zones of silence into a room that was empty at the moment . It had large chesterfields and lounging chairs done in pale yellow leather and arranged around a fireplace , in front of which , on the glossy but not slippery floor , lay a rug as thin as silk and as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , another jet on a low table , walls of dully painted parchment , silence , comfort , space , coziness , a dash of the very modem and a dash of the very old . A very swell room . Carol Pride sniffed at it . The butler swung half of a leather-covered door and Mrs. Prendergastcame in . Pale blue , with a hat and bag to match , all ready to go out . Pale blue gloves slapping lightly at a pale blue thigh . A smile , hints of depths in the black eyes , a high color , and even beforeshe spoke a nice edge . She flung both her hands out at us . Carol Pride managed to miss her share . I squeezed mine . " Gorgeous of you to come , " she cried . " How nice to see you bothp215again . I can still taste that whisky you had in your office . Terrible , was n't it ? " We all sat down . I said : " I did n't really need to take up your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all right and you got your beads back . " " Yes . That strange man . How curious of him to be what he was . I knew him too . Did you know that ? " " Soukesian ? I thought perhaps you knew him , " I said . " Oh yes . Quite well . I must owe you a lot of money . And your poor head . How is it ? " Carol Pride was sitting close to me . She said tinnily , between her teeth , almost to herself , but not quite : " Sawdust and creosote . Even at that the termites are getting her . " I smiled at Mrs. Prendergast and she returned my smile with an angel on its back . " You do n't owe me a nickel , " I said . " There was just one thing  --  " " Impossible . I must . But let 's have a little Scotch , shall we ? " She held her bag on her knees , pressed something under the chair , said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beamed . " Cute , eh ? You ca n't even see the mike . This house is just full of little things like that . Mr. Prendergast loves them . This one talks in the butler 's pantry . " Carol Pride said : " I bet the one that talks by the chauffeur 's bed is cute too . " Mrs. Prendergast did n't hear her . The butler came in with a tray and mixed drinks , handed them around and went out . Over the rim of her glass Mrs. Prendergast said : " You were nice not to tell the police I suspected Lin Paul of being  --  well , you know . Or that I had anything to do with your going to that awful beer parlor . By the way , how did you explain that ? " " Easy . I told them Paul told me himself . He was with you , re-member ? " " But he did n't , of course ? " I thought her eyes were a little sly now . " He told me practically nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't tell me he 'd been blackmailing you . "  |p216I  seemed to be aware that Carol Pride had stopped breathing . Mrs. Prendergast went on looking at me over the rim of her glass . Her face had , for a brief moment , a sort of half-silly , **39;5429;TOOLONG . Then she put her glass down slowly and opened her bag in her lap and got a handkerchief out and bit it . There was silence . " That , " she said in a low voice , " is rather fantastic , is n't it ? " I grinned at her coldly . " The police are a lot like the newspapers , Mrs. Prendergast . For one reason and another they ca n't use everythingthey get . But that does n't make them dumb . Reavis is n't dumb . He does n't really think , any more than I do , that this Soukesian person was really running a tough jewel-heist gang . He could n't have handled people like Moose Magoon for five minutes . They 'd have walked all over his face just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That needs explaining . I think he bought it  --  from Moose Magoon . For the ten-grand pay-off supplied by you  --  and for some other little consideration likely paid in advance to get Moose to pull the job . " Mrs. Prendergast lowered her lids until her eyes were almost shut , then she lifted them again and smiled . It was a rather ghastly smile . Carol Pride did n't move beside me . " Somebody wanted Lindley Paul killed , " I said . " That 's obvious . You might kill a man accidentally with a blackjack , by not knowing how hard to hit with it . But you wo n't put his brains all over his face . And if you beat him up just to teach him to be good , you would n't beat him about the head at all . Because that way he would n't know how badly you were hurting him . And you 'd want him to know that  --  if you were just teaching him a lesson . " " Wha  --  what , " the blond woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " Her face was a mask . Her eyes held a warm bitterness like poisoned honey . One of her hands was roving around inside her bag . It became quiet , inside the bag . " Moose Magoon would pull a job like that , " I bored on , " if he was paid for it . He 'd pull any kind of a job . And Moose was an Armenian , so Soukesian might have known how to reach him . And Soukesian was just the type to go skirt-simple over a roto queen and be willing to do anything she wanted him to do , even have a man killed , especially if that man was a rival , especially if he was thep217kind of a man who rolled around on floor cushions and maybe even took candid camera photos of his lady friends when they got a little too close to the Garden of Eden . That would n't be too hard to understand , would it , Mrs. Prendergast ? " " Take a drink , " Carol Pride said icily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this baby she 's a tramp . She knows it . But how the hell could anybody blackmail her ? You 've got to have a reputationto be blackmailed . " " Shut up ! " I snapped . " The less you 've got the more you 'll pay to keep it . " I watched the blond woman 's hand move suddenly inside her bag . " Do n't bother to pull the gun , " I told her . " I know they wo n't hang you . I just wanted you to know you 're not kidding anybody and that that trap in the beer parlor was rigged to finish me off when Soukesian lost his nerve and that you were the one that sent me in there to get what they had for me . The rest of it 's dead wood now . " But she pulled the gun out just the same and held it on her pale blue knee and smiled at me . Carol Pride threw a glass at her . She dodged and the gun went off . A slug went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making no more sound than a finger going into a glove . The door opened and an enormously tall , thin man strolled into the room . " Shoot me , " he said . " I 'm only your husband . " The blonde looked at him . For just a short moment I thought she might be going to take him up on it . Then she just smiled a little more and put the gun back into her bag and reached for her glass . " Listening in again ? " she said dully . " Someday you 'll hear something you wo n't like . " The tall , thin man took a leather checkbook out of his pocket and cocked an eyebrow at me and said : " How much will keep you quiet  --  permanently ? " I gawked at him . " You heard what I said in here ? " " I think so . The pickup 's pretty good this weather . I believe you were accusing my wife of having something to do with somebody 's death , was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well  --  how much do you want ? " he snapped . " I wo n't argue with you . I 'm used to blackmailers. "  | " Make it a million , " I said . " And she just took a shot at us . That will be four bits extra . " The blonde laughed crazily and the laugh turned into a screech and then into a yell . The next thing she was rolling on the floor screaming and kicking her legs around . The tall man went over to her quickly and bent down and hit her in the face with his open hand . You could have heard that smack a mile . When he straightened up again his face was a dusky red and the blonde was lying there sobbing . " I 'll show you to the door , " he said . " You can call at my office tomorrow . " " What for ? " I asked , and took my hat . " You 'll still be a sap , even at your office . " I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . We left the house silently . The Jap gardener had just pulled a bit of weed root out of the lawn and was holding it up and sneering at it . We drove away from there , towards the foothills . A red stoplight near the old Beverly Hills Hotel stopped me after a while . I just sat there holding the wheel . The girl beside me did n't move either . She did n't say anything . She just looked straight ahead . " I did n't get the big warm feeling , " I said . " I did n't get to smack anybody down . I did n't make it stick . " " She probably did n't plan it in cold blood , " she whispered . " She just got mad and resentful and somebody sold her an idea . A woman like that takes men and gets tired of them and throws them away and they go crazy trying to get her back . It might have been just between the two lovers  --  Paul and Soukesian . But Mr. Magoon played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor , " I said . " That 's enough for me . And Paul had ideas about Soukesian . I knew she 'd miss . With the gun , I mean . " I grabbed her . She was shivering . A car came up behind us and the driver stood on his horn . I listened to it for a little while , then I let go of Carol Pride and got out of the roadster and walked back . He was a big man , behind the wheel of a sedan . " That 's a boulevard stop , " he said sharply . " Lover 's Lane is fartherup in the hills . Get out of there before I push you out . " " Blow your horn just once more , " I begged him . " Just once . Then tell me which side you want the shiner on . " MANDARIN 'S JADE 219He took a police captain 's badge out of his vest pocket . Then he grinned . Then we both grinned . It was n't my day . I got back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards Santa Monica . " Let 's go home and drink some more Scotch , " I said . " Your Scotch . "  |p223IT  must have been Friday because the fish smell from the Mansion House coffee-shop next door was strong enough to build a garage on . Apart from that it was a nice warm day in spring , the tail of the afternoon , and there had n't been any business in a week . I had my heels in the groove on my desk and was sunning my ankles in a wedge of sunlight when the phone rang . I took my hat off it and made a yawningsound into the mouthpiece . A voice said : " I heard that . You ought a be ashamed of yourself , Johnny Dalmas . Ever hear of the Austrian case ? " It was Violets M'Gee , a homicide dick in the sheriff 's office and a very nice guy except for one bad habit  --  passing me cases where I got tossed around and did n't make enough money to buy a secondhandcorset . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Bay City . I hear the little burg went sour again the last time they elected themselves a mayor , but the sheriff lives down there and we like to be nice . We ai n't tramped on it . They say the gambling boys put up thirty grand campaign money , so now you get a racing form with the bill of fare in the hash houses . " I yawned again . " I heard that , too , " M'Gee barked . " If you ai n't interested I 'll just bite my other thumbnail and let the whole thing go . The guy 's got a little dough to spend , he says . " " What guy ? " " This Matson , the guy that found the stiff . " " What stiff ? " " You do n't know nothing about the Austrian case , huh ? " " Did n't I say I did n't ? " " You ai n't done nothing but yawn and say What . ' Okay . We'llp224just let the poor guy get bumped off and City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here in town . " " This Matson ? Who 's going to bump him off ? " " Well , if he knew that , he would n't want to hire no shamus to find out , would he ? And him in your own racket until they bust him a while back and now he ca n't go out hardly , on account of these guys with guns are bothering him . " " Come on over , " I said . " My left arm is getting tired . " " I 'm on duty . " " I was just going down to the drugstore for a quart of V.O. Scotch . " " That 's me you hear knocking on the door , " M'Gee said . He arrived in less than half an hour  --  a large , pleasant-faced man with silvery hair and a dimpled chin and a tiny little mouth made to kiss babies with . He wore a well-pressed blue suit , polished square-toed shoes , and an elk 's tooth on a gold chain hung across his stomach . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and unscrewed the top of the whisky bottle and sniffed it carefully , to make sure I had n't refilled a good bottle with ninety-eight cent hooch , the way they do in the bars . Then he poured himself a big drink and rolled some of it around on his tongue and pawed my office with his eyes . " No wonder you sit around waiting for jobs , " he said . " You got ta have front these days . " " You could spare me a little , " I said . " What about this Matson and this Austrian case ? " M'Gee finished his drink and poured another , not so large . He watched me play with a cigarette . " A monoxide Dutch , " he said . " A blond bim named Austrian , wife of a doctor down at Bay City . A guy that runs around all night keepingmovie hams from having pink elephants for breakfast . So the frill went around on her own . The night she croaked herself she was over to Vance Conried 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeah . It used to be a beach club , with a nice private beach down below and the swellest legs in Hollywood in front of the cabanas . She went there to play roulette , huh ? " " Well , if we had any gambling joints in this county , " M'Gee said , " I 'd say the Club Conried would be one of them and there would bep225roulette . Say she played roulette . They tell me she had more personalgames she played with Conried , but say she played roulette on the side . She loses , which is what roulette is for . That night she loses her shirt and she gets sore and throws a wingding all over the house . Conried gets her into his private room and pages the doc , her husband , through the Physicians ' Exchange . So then the doc  --  " " Wait a minute , " I said . " Do n't tell me all this was in evidence  --  not with the gambling syndicate we would have in this county , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me pityingly . " My wife 's got a kid brother works on a throw-away paper down there . They did n't have no inquest . Well , the doc steams over to Conried 's joint and pokes his wife in the arm with a needle to quiet her down . But he ca n't take her home on account of he has a babe case in Brentwood Heights . So Vance Conried gets his personal car out and takes her home and meantime the doc has called up his office nurse and asked her to go over to the house and see that his wife is all right . Which is all done , and Conried goes back to his chips and the nurse sees her in bed and leaves , and the maid goes back to bed . This is maybe midnight , or just a little after . " Well , along about 2 A.M. this Harry Matson happens by . He 's running a night-watchman service down there and that night he 's out making rounds himself . On the street where Austrian lives he hears a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes in to investigate . He finds the blond frail on the floor on her back , in peekaboopajamas and slippers , with soot from the exhaust all over her hair . " M'Gee paused to sip a little more whisky and stare around my officeagain . I watched the last of the sunlight sneak over my windowsilland drop into the dark slit of the alley . " So what does the chump do ? " M'Gee said , wiping his lips on a silk handkerchief . " He decides the bim is dead , which maybe she is , but you ca n't always be sure in a gas case , what with this new methylene-blue treatment  --  " " For God 's sake , " I said . " What does he do ? " " He do n't call no law , " M'Gee said sternly . " He kills the car motorand douses his flash and beats it home to where he lives a few blocks away . He pages the doc from there and after a while they 're both back at the garage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side door to call the local chief of police personal , at his home . Which Matson does , and after a while the chief buzzes over with a couple of stooges , and a little while after them the body snatcher from the undertaker , whose turn it is to be deputy coroner that week . They cart the stiff away and some lab man takes a blood sampleand says it 's full of monoxide . The coroner gives a release and the dame is cremated and the case is closed . " " Well , what 's the matter with it ? " I asked . M'Gee finished his second drink and thought about having a third . He decided to have a cigar first . I did n't have any cigars and that annoyed him slightly , but he lit one of his own . " I 'm just a cop , " he said , blinking at me calmly through the smoke . " I would n't know . All I know is , this Matson got bust loose from his licence and run out of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " I said . " The last time I muscled into a smalltownsetup I got a fractured skull . How do I contact Matson ? " " I give him your number . He 'll contact you . " " How well do you know him ? " " Well enough to give him your name , " M'Gee said . " Of course , if anything comes up I should look into  --  " " Sure , " I said . " I 'll put it on your desk . Bourbon or rye ? " " Go to hell , " M'Gee said . " Scotch . " " What does Matson look like ? " " He 's medium heavy , five-seven , one-seventy , gray hair . " He had another short , quick drink and left . I sat there for an hour and smoked too many cigarettes . It got dark and my throat felt dry . Nobody called me up . I went over and switched the lights on , washed my hands , tucked away a small drink and locked the bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hat on and was going through the door when the Green Feather messenger boy came along the hallway looking at numbers . He wanted mine . I signed for a small irregular-shaped parcel done up in the kind of flimsy yellowish paper laundries use . I put the parcelon my desk and cut the string . Inside there was tissue paper and an envelope with a sheet of paper and a flat key in it . The note began abruptly : A friend in the sheriff 's office gave me your name as a man I could trust . I have been a heel and am in a jam and all I want now is to get clear . Please come after dark to 524 Tennyson Arms Apartments ,  |p227Harvard  near Sixth , and use key to enter if I am out . Look out for Pat Reel , the manager , as I do n't trust him . Please put the slipper in a safe place and keep it clean . P.S. They call him Violets , I never knew why . I knew why . It was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sounded a little jittery to me . I unwound the tissue paper . It contained a green velvet pump , size about 4A lined with white kid . The name Verschoyle was stamped in flowing gold script on the white kid insole . On the side a number was written very small in indelible ink  --  S465  --  where a size numberwould be , but I knew it was n't a size number because Verschoyle , Inc. , on Cherokee Street in Hollywood made only custom shoes from individual lasts , and theatrical footwear and riding boots . I leaned back and lit a cigarette and thought about it for a while . Finally I reached for the phone book and looked up the number of Verschoyle , Inc. , and dialed it . The phone rang several times before a chirpy voice said : " Hello ? Yes ? " " Verschoyle  --  in person , " I said . " This is Peters , Identification Bureau . " I did n't say what identification bureau . " Oh , Mr. Verschoyle has gone home . We 're closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm Mr. Pringle , the bookkeeper . Is there anything --  " " Yeah . We got a couple of your shoes in some stolen goods . The mark is S-Four-Six-Five . That mean anything to you ? " " Oh yes , of course . That 's a last number . Shall I look it up for you ? " " By all means , " I said . He was back in no time at all . " Oh yes , indeed , that is Mrs. Leland Austrian 's number . Seven-thirty-six Altair Street , Bay City . We made all her shoes . Very sad . Yes . About two months ago we made her two pairs of emerald velvet pumps . " " What do you mean , sad ? " " Oh , she 's dead , you know . Committed suicide . " " The hell you say . Two pairs of pumps , huh ? " " Oh yes , both the same you know . People often order delicate colors in pairs like that . You know a spot or stain of any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress  --  " " Well , thanks a lot and take care of yourself , " I said , and gave the phone back to him.  |p228I  picked up the slipper again and looked it over carefully . It had n't been worn . There was no sign of rubbing on the buffed leather of the thin sole . I wondered what Harry Matson was doingwith it . I put it in my office safe and went out to dinner . I I Murder on the CuffTHE TENNYSON ARMS was an old-fashioned dump , about eight stories high , faced with dark red brick . It had a wide center court with palm trees and a concrete fountain and some prissy-looking flower beds . Lanterns hung beside the Gothic door and the lobby inside was paved with red plush . It was large and empty except for a bored canary in a gilt cage the size of a barrel . It looked like the sort of apartment house where widows would live on the life insurance  --  not very young widows . The elevator was the self-operating kind that opens both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow maroon carpet of the fifth-floor hallwayand did n't see anybody , hear anybody , or smell anybody 's cooking . The place was as quiet as a minister 's study . Apartment 524 must have opened on the center court because a stained-glass window was right beside its door . I knocked , not loud , and nobody came to the door so I used the flat key and went in , and shut the door behind me . A mirror glistened in a wall bed across the room . Two windows in the same wall as the entrance door were shut and dark drapes were drawn half across them , but enough light from some apartment across the court drifted in to show the dark bulk of heavy , overstuffedfurniture , ten years out of date , and the shine of two brass doorknobs . I went over to the windows and pulled the drapes close , then used my pocket flash to find my way back to the door . The light switch there set off a big cluster of flame-colored candles in the ceilingfixture . They made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light on in a red standing lamp , doused the ceiling light and started to give the place the camera eye . In the narrow dressing room behind the wall bed there was a built-in bureau with a black brush and comb on it and gray hairs inp229the comb . There was a can of talcum , a flashlight , a crumpled man 's handkerchief , a pad of writing paper , a bank pen and a bottle of ink on a blotter  --  about what one suitcase would hold in the drawers . The shirts had been bought in a Bay City men 's furnishing store . There was a dark gray suit on a hanger and a pair of black brogues on the floor . In the bathroom there was a safety razor , a tube of brushless cream , some blades , three bamboo toothbrushes in a glass , a few other odds and ends . On the porcelain toilet tank there was a book bound in red cloth  --  Dorsey 's Why We Behave Like Human Beings . It was marked at page 116 by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Evolution of Earth , Life and Sex when the phone started to ring in the living room . I snicked off the bathroom light and padded across the carpet to the davenport . The phone was on a stand at one end . It kept on ringing and a horn tooted outside in the street , as if answering it . When it had rung eight times I shrugged and reached for it . " Pat ? Pat Reel ? " the voice said . I did n't know how Pat Reel would talk . I grunted . The voice at the other end was hard and hoarse at the same time . It sounded like a tough-guy voice . " Pat ? " " Sure , " I said . There was silence . It had n't gone over . Then the voice said : " This is Harry Matson . Sorry as all hell I ca n't make it back tonight . Just one of those things . That bother you much ? " " Sure , " I said . " What 's that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words you know , for God 's sake ? " " I 'm a Greek . " The voice laughed . It seemed pleased with itself . I said : " What kind of toothbrushes do you use , Harry ? " " Huh ? " This was a startled explosion of breath  --  not so pleased now . " Toothbrushes  --  the little dinguses some people brush their teeth with . What kind do you use ? " " Aw , go to hell . " " Meet you on the step , " I said . The voice got mad now . " Listen , smart monkey ! You ai n't pull/ing nothin ' , see ? We got your name , we got your number , and we got a place to put you if you do n't keep your nose clean , see ? And Harry do n't live there any more , ha , ha . " " You picked him off , huh ? " " I 'll say we picked him off . What do you think we done , took him to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " The boss wo n't like that . " I hung up in his face and put the phone down on the table at the end of the davenport and rubbed the back of my neck . I took the door key out of my pocket and polished it on my handkerchief and laid it down carefully on the table . I got up and walked across to one of the windows and pulled the drapes aside far enough to look out into the court . Across its palm-dotted oblong , on the same floor level I was on , a bald-headed man sat in the middle of a room under a hard , bright light , and did n't move a muscle . He did n't look like a spy . I let the drapes fall together again and settled my hat on my head and went over and put the lamp out . I put my pocket flash down on the floor and palmed my handkerchief on the doorknob and quietly opened the door . Braced to the door frame by eight hooked fingers , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung what was left of a man . He had eyes an eighth of an inch deep , china-blue , wide open . They looked at me but they did n't see me . He had coarse gray hair on which the smeared blood looked purple . One of his temples was a pulp , and the tracery of blood from it reached clear to the point of his chin . The one straining finger that was n't white had been pounded to shreds as far as the second joint . Sharp splinters of bone stuck out of the mangled flesh . Something that might once have been a fingernail looked now like a ragged splinter of glass . The man wore a brown suit with patch pockets , three of them . They had been torn off and hung at odd angles showing the dark alpaca lining beneath . He breathed with a faraway unimportant sound , like distant footfalls on dead leaves . His mouth was strained open like a fish 's mouth , and blood bubbled from it . Behind him the hallway was empty as a new-dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood beside the hall runner . The man 's straining fingers slipped from thep231door frame and his body started to wind up on his legs . The legs could n't hold it . They scissored and the body turned in mid-air , like a swimmer in a wave , and then jumped at me . I clamped my teeth hard and spread my feet and caught him from behind , after his torso had made a half turn . He weighed enough for two men . I took a step back and nearly went down , took two more and then I had his dragging heels clear of the doorway . I let him down on his side as slowly as I could , crouched over him panting . After a second I straightened , went over to the door and shut and locked it . Then I switched the ceiling light on and started for the telephone . He died before I reached it . I heard the rattle , the spent sigh , then silence . An outflung hand , the good one , twitched once and the fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I went back and felt his carotid artery , digging my fingers in hard . Not a flicker of a pulse . I got a small steel mirror out of my wallet and held it against his open mouth for a long minute . There was no trace of mist on it when I took it away . Harry Matson had come home from his ride . A key tickled at the outside of the door lock and I moved fast . I was in the bathroom when the door opened , with a gun in my hand and my eyes to the crack of the bathroom door . This one came in quickly , the way a wise cat goes through a swing door . His eyes flicked up at the ceiling lights , then down at the floor . After that they did n't move at all . All his big body did n't move a muscle . He just stood and looked . He was a big man in an unbuttoned overcoat , as if he had just come in or was just going out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick creamy-white head . He had the heavy black eyebrows and broad pink face of a boss politician , and his mouth looked as if it usually had the smile  --  but not now . His face was all bone and his mouth jiggled a half-smoked cigar along his lips with a sucking noise . He put a bunch of keys back in his pocket and said " God ! " very softly , over and over again . Then he took a step forward and went clown beside the dead man with a slow , clumsy motion . He put large fingers into the man 's neck , took them away again , shook his head , looked slowly around the room . He looked at the bathroom door behind which I was hiding , but nothing changed in his eyes.  | " Fresh dead , " he said , a little louder . " Beat to a pulp . " He straightened up slowly and rocked on his heels . He did n't like the ceiling light any better than I had . He put the standing lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heels some more . His shadow crawled up the end wall , started across the ceiling , paused and dropped back again . He worked the cigar around in his mouth , dug a match out of his pocket and relit the butt carefully , turning it around and around in the flame . When he blew the match out he put it in his pocket . He did all this without once taking his eyes off the dead man on the floor . He moved sideways over to the davenport and let himself down on the end of it . The springs squeaked dismally . He reached for the phone without looking at it , eyes still on the dead man . He had the phone in his hand when it started to ring again . That jarred him . His eyes rolled and his elbows jerked against the sides of his thick overcoated body . Then he grinned very carefully and lifted the phone off the cradle and said in a rich , fruity voice : " Hello . . . . Yeah , this is Pat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire , and I saw Pat Reel 's face slowly congest with blood until it was the color of fresh beef liver . His big hand shook the phone savagely . " So it 's Mister Big Chin ! " he blared . " Well , listen here , saphead , you know something ? Your stiff is right here on my carpet , that 's where he is . . . . How did he get here ? How the hell would I know ? Ask me , you croaked him here , and lemme tell you something . It 's costing you plenty , see , plenty . No murder on the cuff in my house . I spot a guy for you and you knock him off in my lap , damn you ! I 'll take a grand and not a cent less , and you come and get what 's here and I mean get it , see ? " There was more croaking on the wire . Pat Reel listened . His eyes got almost sleepy and the purple died out of his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only kidding . . . . Call me in half an hour downstairs . " He put down the phone and stood up . He did n't look towards the bathroom door , he did n't look anywhere . He began to whistle . Then he scratched his chin and took a step towards the door , stopped to scratch his chin again . He did n't know there was anybody in the apartment , he did n't know there was n't anybody in the apartment  --  and he did n't have a gun . He took another step towards thep233door . Big Chin had told him something and the idea was to get out . He took a third step , then he changed his mind . " Aw hell , " he said out loud . " That screwy mug . " Then his eyes ranged round the apartment swiftly . " Tryin ' to kid me , huh ? " His hand raised to the chain switch . Suddenly he let it fall and knelt beside the dead man again . He moved the body a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his face down close to squint at the spot where the head had lain . Pat Reel shook his head in displeasure , got to his feet and put his hands under the dead man 's armpits . He threw a glance over his shoulder at the dark bathroom and started to back towards me , dragging the body , grunting , the cigar butt still clamped in his mouth . His creamy-white hair glistenedcleanly in the lamplight . He was still bent over with his big legs spraddled when I stepped out behind him . He may have heard me at the last second but it did n't matter . I had shifted the gun to my left hand and I had a small pocket sap in my right . I laid the sap against the side of his head , just behind his right ear , and I laid it as though I loved it . Pat Reel collapsed forward across the sprawled body he was dragging , his head down between the dead man 's legs . His hat rolled gently off to the side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and left . OVER on Western Avenue I found a phone booth and called the sheriff 's office . Violets M'Gee was still there , just ready to go home . I said : " What was the name of your kid brother-in-law that works on the throw-away paper down at Bay City ? " " Kincaid . They call him Dolly Kincaid . A little feller . " " Where would he be about now ? " " He hangs around the city hall . Thinks he 's got a police beat . Why ? " " I saw Matson , " I said . " Do you know where he 's staying ? " " Naw . He just called me on the phone . What you think of him ? "  | " I 'll do what I can for him . Will you be home tonight ? " " I do n't know why not . Why ? " I did n't tell him why . I got into my car and pointed it towards Bay City . I got down there about nine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city hall that belonged in the hookwormand-Biblebelt . I pushed past a knot of smoothies into an open doorwaywhere there was light and a counter . There was a PBX board in the corner and a uniformed man behind it . I put an arm on the counter and a plainclothes man with his coat off and an under-arm holster looking the size of a wooden leg against his ribs took one eye off his paper and said , " Yeah ? " and bonged a spittoon without moving his head more than an inch . I said : " I 'm looking for a fellow named Dolly Kincaid . " " Out to eat . I 'm holdin ' down his beat , " he said in a solid , unemotionalvoice . " Thanks . You got a pressroom here ? " " Yeah . Got a toilet , too . Wanta see ? " " Take it easy , " I said . " I 'm not trying to get fresh with your town . " He bonged the spittoon again . " Pressroom 's down the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get drowned in a pop bottle . " A small-boned , delicate-faced young man with a pink complexion and innocent eyes strolled into the room with a half-eaten hamburgersandwich in his left hand . His hat , which looked like a reporter'shat in a movie , was smashed on the back of his small blond head . His shirt collar was unbuttoned at the neck and his tie was pulled to one side . The ends of it hung out over.his coat . The only thing the matter with him for a movie newshawk was that he was n't drunk . He said casually : " Anything stirring , boys ? " The big black-haired plainclothes man bonged his private spittoonagain and said : " I hear the mayor changed his underpants , but it 's just a rumor . The small young man smiled mechanically and turned away . The cop said : " This guy wants to see you , Dolly . " Kincaid munched his hamburger and looked at me hopefully . I said : I 'm a friend of Violets ' . Where can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . The black-haired cop studied me as we went out . He had a look in his eyes as if he wanted to pick a fight with somebody , and he thought I would do.  |p235We  went along the hall towards the back and turned into a room with a long , bare , scarred table , three or four wooden chairs and a lot of newspapers on the floor . There were two telephones on one end of the table , and a flyblown framed picture in the exact center of each wall  --  Washington , Lincoln , Horace Greeley , and the other one somebody I did n't recognize . Kincaid shut the door and sat on one end of the table and swung his leg and bit into the last of his sandwich . I said : " I 'm John Dalmas , a private dick from L.A. How 's to take a ride over to Seven Twenty-six Altair Street and tell me what you know about the Austrian case ? Maybe you better call M'Gee up and get him to introduce us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man slid down off the table very rapidly and stuffed the card into his pocket without looking at it and spoke close to my ear . " Hold it . " Then he walked softly over to the framed picture of Horace Greeleyand lifted it off the wall and pressed on a square of paint behind it . The paint gave  --  it was painted over fabric . Kincaid looked at me and raised his eyebrows . I nodded . He hung the picture back on the wall and came back to me . " Mike , " he said under his breath . " Of course I do n't know who listens or when , or even whether the damn thing still works . " " Horace Greeley would have loved it , " I said . " Yeah . The beat 's pretty dead tonight . I guess I could go out . Al De Spain will cover for me anyway . " He was talking loud now . " The big black-haired cop ? " " Yeah . " " What makes him sore ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even working tonight . Just hangs around and he 's so tough it would take the whole damn police force to throw him out . " I looked towards the microphone and raised my eyebrows . " That 's okay , " Kincaid said . " I got ta feed ' em something to chew on . " He went over to a dirty washbowl in the corner and washed his hands on a scrap of lava soap and dried them on his pocket handkerchief . He was just putting the handkerchief away when the door opened . A small , middle-aged , gray-haired man stood in it , looking at us expressionlessly . Dolly Kincaid said : " Evening , Chief , anything I can do for you ? "  |p236The  chief looked at me silently and without pleasure . He had sea-green eyes , a tight , stubborn mouth , a ferret-shaped nose , and an unhealthy skin . He did n't look big enough to be a cop . He nodded very slightly and said : " Who 's your friend ? " " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from L.A. Let 's see  --  " Kincaid gripped desperately in his pocket for my card . He did n't even remember my name . The chief said sharply : " What 's that ? A private detective ? What 's your business here ? " " I did n't say I was here on business , " I told him . " Glad to hear it , " he said . " Very glad to hear it . Good night . " He opened the door and went out quickly and snapped it shut behind him . " Chief Anders  --  one swell guy , " Kincaid said loudly . " They do n't come any better . " He was looking at me like a scared rabbit . " They never have , " I said just as loudly . " In Bay City . " I thought for a moment he was going to faint , but he did n't . We went out in the front of the city hall and got into my car and drove away . I stopped the car on Altair Street across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was windless and there was a little fog under the moon . A faint pleasant smell of brackish water and kelp came up the side of the bluff from the beach . Small riding lights pinpointed the yacht harbor and the shimmering lines of three piers . Quite far out to sea a big-masted fishing barge had lights strung between its masts and from the mastheads down to the bow and stern . Other things than fishing probably happened on it . Altair Street in that block was a dead-end , cut off by a tall , ornamentaliron fence that walled a big estate . The houses were on the inland side of the street only , on eighty- or hundred-foot lots , well spaced . On the seaward side there was a narrow sidewalk and a low wall , beyond which the bluff dropped almost straight down . Dolly Kincaid was pressed back into the corner of the seat , the red tip of a cigarette glowing at intervals in front of his small blurred face . The Austrian house was dark except for a small light over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stucco , with a wall across the front yard , iron gates , the garage outside the wall . A cementwalk went from a side door of the garage to a side door of the house . There was a bronze plate set into the wall beside the gates and I knew it would read Leland M. Austrian ,
