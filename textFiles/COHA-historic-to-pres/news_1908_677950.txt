Plan Is to Eliminate Morse Wholly from Business Situation  --  He Gives $10,000 Bail on Perjury Charge . An involuntary petition in bankruptcy will be filed this afternoon in the United States District Court against Charles W. Morse by a combination of his creditors , who have determined to have a general distribution of his remaining assets among the interests having claims against him . The arrangements for this move , all except obtaining the signature of one -a the three necessary petitioners , were completed yesterd'ay , and it remains only to affix the last name to the legal papers and file them in court . Behind the action lies the plan , in pur --  -- tuauce of which the entire campaign upon Mr. Morse has been carried on , of putting him permanently out of business by dissipating what remains of his once large fortune . It has been perfectly well recognized ever since the crisis - of his of- ! fairs was reached , ' a couple of weeks ago , that the only chance remaining for anything to be realized beyond the debts themselves out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' community was to have the creditors hold off , in the hope that an improve ment in Conditions would bring the securities up to a. fair liquidating value . ' The disposition of most of the creditors up to within a few days has been to wait . and the parties that will appear as petitioners are understood to have met with some opposition in their efforts to bring sufficient creditor interests together to make the scheme practicable . But it appears that the pressure exerted ever since last October from Important banking quarters to have Morse eliminated absolutely from financial affairs has at last prevailed , and the bankruptcy proceedings are therefore about to be started . Creditors Who Will Benefit . Curiously enough the individuals to be most benefited by the bankruptcy proceedings are not the various Wall Street institutions most disposed to have them brought , iot a number of individual crediters of the ex-banker , whose claims against him . are . unsecured . Ever since last October Morse has been trying , to arrange for securing different claims of this variety which have pressed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had pledged in different banking institutions after the- satisfaction of their claims . Among those creditors whose claims have thus been protected are the Fourteenth Street Bank , where ' ast October he had an unsecured note . for $100,000 ; Philip J. Britt , his counsel , to whom he owed $52,000 ; O'Brien , Boardman &; Platt , claimants under Mr. Morse 's agreement to repurchase 637 shares of the stock of the . National Bank of North America sold to Mr. O'Brien last Spring , and Albert B. Boardman , who has been acting recently as his counsel , a creditor ever since last October on account of legal services and disbursements . There are many others who have obtained some kind of security for their.claims out of possible ' Marginal values in collateral elsewhere hypothecated , and many more remain whose claims are yet unsecured . These latter creditors , it appears , have not beep concerned in the bankruptcy plans . They are , for the most part , individuals who have been engaged with Mr. Morse in different ventures . speculative and otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are to file the bankruptcy petition to-day , however , are keen to have it on record ' before the close of business , for the assignment to O'Brien , Boardman &; Platt ' of valuable collateral on their claim was made on Oct. 19. and if the bankruptcy proceedings went over until to-morrow it would not be possible to have this assignment Invalidated under the fourmonth clause in the bankruptcy law prohibiting preferred payments to creditors . Some of the Assignments . The assignment to Mr. O'Brien 's firm covers 667 shares of the  --  stock of the National Bank of North America , 500 shares of the stock of the Fourteenth Street Bank . 500 shares of the New Amsterdam National Bank , and , 100 shares of Garfield National Bank stock . B. A. C. Smith , who had a transaction in the stock of the National Bank of North America similar to that with Mr. O'Brien , also comes in on this block of collateral , and ft is provided in the agreement between the Parties that Mr. Boardman shall have a claim on two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services and disbu:sements . The assignment to the Fourteenth Street Bank and Mr. Britt covers whatever equity may remain in the collateral pledged by Mr. Morse to secure the $243. - 000 debt to the National Bank of North America , the $.572,000 debt to John E. Berwind , and the ** of notes placed for Mr. Morse through the firm of R S. Moseley &; Co. throughout New England and elsewhere . This was made In January , and copies of it served on the National Bank of North America , Receiver Hanna of that institution . Mr. Berwind , and Moseley &; Co. , when Mr. Hanna 's attachments went out all over the city . It will be knocked out if bankruptcy proceedings are successfully maintained now , and the Fourteenth Street Bank and Mr. Britt , like Mr. O'Brien 's firm and Mr. Smith . will have to take their chances with the other creditors . Morse Fights Attachments . That a fight will be made by Mr:Morse and his counsel against these measures of elimination became obvious yesterday when Mr. Britt , In the Supreme Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachments obtained by Receiver Hanna set aside on the ground that the papers on which they were obtained and supporting affidavits contain fatal defects , which vitiate the action . In this connegion it was said by friends of Mr. Morse that the collateral sect/ring ' the claim of $243,000 on . which the NaL. ihmal Bank of North America is suing Morse is Worth , - even at the present prices Continned-'on MOVE TO PUT NORSE INTO BANKRUPTCY // Per the Morse securities , more than $100 , - 000 in excess of the face of the loan , and that the bank was fully protected on its claim before it sought the attachments which have revealed Mr. Morse 's assets wherever pledged . In support of this contention it was pointed out that the collateral now held against this loan was  --  put in the National Bank ' of North America by Mr. Morse right at the time of the financial disturbanCes last October at the direction of the New York Clearing House authorities , and must at that time have been considered amply adequate , since the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clearing House stood then behind the bank . Since that time , it is argued . the collateral could not have depreciated ' so greatly as to seriously threaten the bank 's claim , and , as a matter of fact , the assertion is made that a margin of 8100,000 and more still exists . Mrs. Morse 's Claims . The affidavit of Mrs. Morse , on which she proposes to combat the attachment of the furnishings of the Morse residence at 728 Fifth Avenue , was filed with the Sheriff yesterday . It relates that Mrs. Morse was married In 1901 and has occupied the residence at 728 Fifth Avenue since 1006 . " Before I was established in that house , " says Mrs. Morse , " I had the house redecorated and almost entirely refurnished . I made at that time , and have Made at various times since then , many purchases of furniture , rugs , and other household effects , practically all of which are still in the house and belong to me . I hereby make claim to them , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Keiger electric brougham , and make claim to them . " The affidavit values all the property enumerated at 8 ; 10,000 , and asserts that Mrs. Morse has either receipts or canceled checks covering its purchase . The hearing before the Sheriff 's jury is set down for Monday , and Mrs. Morse values the injury alleged to have been done her by I the attachment at $2,000 . Mr. Morse appeared before Justice Dowling in the Supreme gourt yesterday morning for arraignment , on the perjury indictment returned against him on Monday . Mr. Britt . on his behalf , entered a plea of not guilty , and asked for two weeks within which to demur to the indictments or otherwise change the plea . .. kssisMra District Attorney Kresel objected and wanted the time limited to one week , which the Justice set , with the promise asp on Monday that if further time were required he would be disposed to grant It . When iit came to a question of bail , there was a warm argument between the two lawyers . Mr. Kresel wanted bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britt protested that his client had already given20,000 bail oil the other indictments , and any such demand was indefensible and outrageous . Justice Dowling said . that he would fix the bail at 810,000 On the perjury indictment , and Mr. Britt took an exception on the ground that it was excessive . Bail was furnished by the Fidelity and Bonding Company of Maryland . which gave the bail on ' the larceny indictments.
