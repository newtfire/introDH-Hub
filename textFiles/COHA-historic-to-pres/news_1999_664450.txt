Excerpts from the report released Tuesday by an independent ethics panel for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee : <p> 1991-92 - The Campaign Begins <p> ... In November 1991 , the wife of Seiuli Paul Wallwork , an IOC member from Western Somoa , sent a letter to Mr. Welch stating that she needed to speak with Mr. Welch on " a matter of great urgency . " The substance of Mrs. Wallwork 's request is contained in a telegram dated November 12 , 1991 , in which she states that she needs Mr. Welch 's assistance " to help a friend in a serious situation " and asks Mr. Welch to remit $ 30,000 U.S. dollars to her account in Auckland , New Zealand . The telegram also states that the loan has " nothing to do with Paul ( Mr. Wallwork ) or bid city but ( is to be ) regard(ed) as ( a ) business arrangement between you and me . " In response , the Bid Committee 's records show , that Mr. Welch authorized a $ 30,000 wire transfer from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While there is correspondence in 1992 indicating that the loan had not been repaid to Mr. Welch , in an interview with the Board of Ethics , Rod Hamson stated that Mr. Welch told him that it was eventually repaid . ... <p> ... At the same time that Mr. Welch was lending money to Mrs. Wallwork , he and other senior Bid Committee officials embarked on a program to provide assistance to relatives of other IOC members . During the 1991-92 time period at least four relatives or associates of IOC members received tuition and/or living assistance from Bid Committee funds . This assistance has been widely described as a " scholarship program , " but in reality the payments bore little resemblance to traditional scholarships . ... <p> Scholarship Program <p> In October 1991 , management authorized the first tuition payments from Bid Committee funds . That month Sibo Sibandze , the son of David Sibandze , the IOC member from Swaziland , began attending the University of Utah with his tuition and living expenses paid by the Bid Committee . ... <p> On April 1 , 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soukhorado at the University of Utah . Like Sibo Sibandze , Ms. Soukhorado was introduced to the Bid Committee by an IOC member . ... The files indicate that Ms. Soukhorado had been a student at the University of Maryland on a foreign student exchange in the spring of 1991 . The files do not reveal the precise nature of Ms. Soukhorado 's connection to Dr. Kim ; there are , however , several pieces of correspondence between Dr. Kim , David Johnson and Ms. Soukhorado in October and November 1991 , indicating that Dr. Kim was helping handle her arrangements with the Bid Committee . ... <p> Shortly after the Soukhorado payments began , the Bid Committee also paid for Bold Magvan , the son of the IOC member from Mongolia , Shagdarjav Magvan , to attend classes at the University of Utah . While these expenses were relatively minimal ( $ 762 ) , again there is no evidence that the " scholarship " criteria were applied . However , Bold Magvan did not come to Salt Lake City primarily to attend classes ; rather , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year-long internship . ... <p> Kim and Keystone <p> Sometime in the spring of 1992 , Mr. Welch , using Bid Committee funds , arranged for the son of Dr. Kim to work at a local communications company , reimbursing all costs associated with his employment . According to Mr. Welch , Dr. Kim contacted him , explaining that his son Jung Hoon ( " John " ) Kim was being laid off from his employment in New York City and needed to find other employment in the United States to retain his green card . Because John Kim had some experience in the telecommunications industry , Mr. Welch contacted David Simmons , the former CEO of Keystone Communications , a satellite telecommunications company based at that time in Salt Lake City . With Mr. Welch 's assistance , Keystone hired John Kim . ... <p> According to interviews with Mr. Welch , Keystone ultimately felt that it had not received value from the relationship with Mr. Kim and demanded reimbursement for his salary from the Bid Committee . Mr. Simmons believed that to have been the arrangement from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , benefits ) were all to be repaid to Keystone by the Bid Committee as " consulting fees " for putative consulting on satellite transmission . A consulting agreement between the Bid Committee and Keystone dated July 1 , 1992 , indicates that Keystone would be paid $ 30,000 for arranging " private meetings with IOC members . " Mr. Simmons has no recollection that Keystone was in a position to arrange such meetings . <p> Mr. Simmons recalled that Keystone was reimbursed the full costs of John Kim 's employment , which amounted to between $ 75,000 and $ 100,000 . Mr. Simmons stated that pursuant to their arrangement , Keystone sent invoices to the Bid Committee , most likely on a monthly basis , requesting payment simply for " consulting services " without any information referencing Mr. Kim or his father . Mr. Simmons further stated that the Bid Committee paid all amounts due , though he recalls that at least one of the invoices was paid on behalf of the Bid Committee by a company that Mr. Simmons could not identify . Mr. Simmons does not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson . <p> The Board of Ethics ' review of the Bid Committee 's financial records revealed two payments to Keystone totaling $ 45,000 . The first was on September 30 , 1992 , in the amount of $ 15,000 ; the second was on April 26 , 1993 , for $ 30,000 . <p> In a January 30 , 1999 letter to the Board of Ethics , Dr. Kim 's attorneys deny that he ever knew of the arrangement for the Bid Committee to pay Keystone for the costs of employing his son . ... <p> Scholarship Program Expands <p> In July 1992 , three months after Mr. Magvan and Ms. Soukhorado appear to have started classes at the University of Utah , Bid Committee management expanded its so-called " Scholarship Program " beyond educational costs to include the payment of living expenses for non-students . In June 1992 , Nancy Rignault Arroyo , the daughter of Agustin Arroyo , IOC member from Ecuador , arrived in Salt Lake City . The next month , the Bid Committee started paying Ms. Arroyo 's living expenses at the Santa Fe Apartments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and totaled nearly $ 23,000 . <p> While the documents do not provide a clear picture of Ms. Arroyo 's stay in Salt Lake City , it is evident that she was not a student . Mr. Welch told the Board of Ethics that sometime in the spring of 1992 he was approached by Mr. Arroyo to with a request assist his daughter , who at the time was a citizen of the United States living in Texas . According to Mr. Welch , she was divorced and was having some personal problems . Mr. Welch agreed to bring her to Salt Lake City and assist her in finding a job . She worked for Salt Lake City , painting a mural at the Fair Grounds ; later she worked for short periods at Tony Roma 's restaurant and for the Bid Committee . Ms. Arroyo returned to Texas in 1994 . <p> Consultants <p> The budgets also indicate that during 1993 and 1994 the Bid Committee entered into new contracts with several consultants to assist with introductions to IOC members . The Bid Committee had used consultants during its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later appear to have played a more significant role . ... <p> Mahmoud El Farnawani , a consultant based in Toronto , Canada , who focuses on IOC members from the Mediterranean , began to assist the Bid Committee in late 1992 , but was not paid until October 5 , 1993 . The Bid Committee paid Mr. El Farnawani a total of $ 148,260 over the next three years . <p> The Committee also entered into a consulting contract with Muttaleb Ahmad , the Director General of the Olympic Council of Asia . Mr. Ahmad was paid $ 62,400 from June 1994 through June 1995 to assist the Bid Committee with lobbying IOC members from the Middle East and some North African countries . <p> In the first bid period , the Bid Committee entered into a consulting contract with an entity called " Citius , " which has been linked to Alfredo La Mont , who recently resigned as the USOC Director of International Relations and Protocol . This agreement required Citius to arrange meetings and provide other lobbying services with IOC members . In consideration for these services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $ 20,000.00 . The financial records of the Bid Committee indicate that between March 1990 and May 1991 , Citius was paid $ 25,714.35 by nine checks . While the consulting contract was signed on behalf of Citius by Antonio Aguilar , one copy of the draft contract was faxed to Mr. La Mont 's fax number ; the USOC has confirmed to the Board of Ethics that Mr. Aguilar and Mr. La Mont were business associates in Citius . The records of the Bid Committee do not reflect the extent of the services that Citius performed under the contract . <p> In the second bid period , the Bid Committee had a consulting relationship with another entity affiliated with Mr. La Mont called ARCA , Inc . While one payment to ARCA was made in February 1992 , the bulk of the payments to ARCA were made in 1994 and 1995 . Through October 1995 , the Bid Committee made six payments totaling $ 18,185.90 . The Bid Committee records do not indicate the extent of the contract services performed by ARCA under the consulting agreement . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARCA to Austin Sealy , an IOC member from Barbados . <p> In 1993 , Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson arranged a consulting relationship of a different sort between the Bid Committee and Bjarne Haggman , the husband of Finnish IOC member Pirjo Haggman . Mr. Haggman , a forester with a masters degree in Forestry from the University of Helsinki , was previously employed from January 1989 to September 1990 as a Forest Inventory Specialist with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in Canada . It has been reported that he secured this job with the assistance of the Toronto Bid Committee , which made an unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Summer Games . <p> Our review of the financial records revealed that the Bid Committee made eight wire transfers directly to Mr. Haggman , from May 4 , 1994 through June 7 , 1995 , for a total of $ 33,750 . When questioned about these payments , Mr. Johnson stated that Mr. Haggman approached him in 1993 and requested assistance in finding a job in the forestry industry . ... <p> Relative Assistance <p> In February 1993 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scally . These payments , made from Bid Committee funds , appear to have been a $ 500 monthly commitment . Mr. Scally is notable among those who received funds under the NOC Program for the almost complete absence of any documentation relating to the origin or purpose of the payments . ... In total , Mr. Scally received $ 14,500 , with the last $ 500 payment made in February 1996 . ... <p> In August 1993 , Bid Committee officials entered into one of the Bid Committee 's most expensive relationships . The Bid Committee 's records reveal that payments to Sonia Essomba , the daughter of Professor Rene Essomba , then the IOC member from Cameroon , were intended to support her as she attended American University in Washington , D.C. The records demonstrate that the Bid Committee paid Ms. Essomba 's rent , tuition and expenses from August 1993 until November 1996 , at a total cost of $ 108,350 . ... <p> Also in August 1993 , the Bid Committee flew Ms. Essomba along with Moriba and Mohammed Keita , the sons of the IOC Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. to Salt Lake City , so that Ms. Essomba , and Messrs . Keita could help organize the United States National Gymnastics Championships . In August 1993 , Professor Essomba sent Mr. Johnson a letter authorizing the Bid Committee to hire his daughter as a hostess for those championships . The Bid Committee flew Ms. Essomba to Salt Lake City again from December 18-22 , 1994 for a visit with her family . ... <p> In December 1993 , Bid Committee officials began a relationship with Zuhair Gadir , the son of General Zein El Abdin Mohamed Ahmed Abdel Gadir ( " General Gadir " ) , an IOC member from Sudan . Like the payments to Mr. Scally , these payments were made directly to Zuhair , not to a university , and were paid without regard to their ultimate use . <p> In a letter from Mr. Welch to Zuhair , dated December 3 , 1993 , Mr. Welch stated that he had become aware through " mutual friends " that Zuhair was attending college at Southern Mississippi University . ... The direct payments to Zuhair , totaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continued through June 7 , 1995 . <p> IOC member visits to Salt Lake <p> The Bid Committee paid for IOC members and their relatives ( sometimes more than one ) to fly first class to Salt Lake City ( often more than once ) , and on some occasions paid for their travel to other Olympic events . While in Salt Lake City , IOC members were given extensive planned itineraries , which included trips to the venues and other local sites , and dinners at local restaurants and at private homes . <p> IOC members invited by the Bid Committee to visit Salt Lake City typically stayed for three days . In many cases , rooms were donated by local hotels , so the Bid Committee 's records do not indicate the length of the IOC member 's stay . It is apparent , though , that several IOC members remained for extended stays at the expense of the Bid Committee . For instance , in December 1994 , the Bid Committee paid for the family of Agustin Arroyo , the IOC member from Ecuador , to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This vacation , which appears to have lasted two weeks , cost the Bid Committee more than $ 10,000 . <p> In some cases , Bid Committee management hosted IOC members at their own homes as part of the " Olympic Family . " Some IOC members treated their site visits more like vacations . For instance , the families of IOC members Phillip Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala made a total of four visits together to the United States at the Bid Committee 's expense . The Coles and Kaltschmitt families stayed at expensive hotels and followed the same recreational itinerary . Two of these trips were only four months apart in 1995 , including a Super Bowl trip that does not appear to have included a visit to Salt Lake City . Mr. Welch served as their host at the Super Bowl ; the expenses were paid as reimbursements to Mr. Welch . <p> There are other examples of IOC members enjoying additional stays at the Bid Committee 's expense at locations other than Salt Lake City . The Bid Committee on several occasions paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and London for extended periods of time both before and after trips to Salt Lake City . While some IOC members from Third World countries may have needed a few days in Paris or London to arrange for U.S. visas , it is apparent from the SLOC records that many of these extended stays either had no relation to obtaining travel documents or were far longer than necessary . In more than one instance the Bid Committee paid for extended stays after a trip to Salt Lake City . <p> For example , the documents indicate that the Bid Committee paid for the family of IOC Member Rene Essomba to stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris on December 8-12 and 23-28 , 1994 and on December 8-12 and 23-28 , 1995 at the rate of approximately $ 300 per night . The Bid Committee also paid for Mr. and Mrs. Essomba 's first-class round-trip airfare from Cameroon to Paris for the December 1994 stay , and paid for the Essombas to continue that trip to New York , Atlanta , and Salt Lake City . A letter from Mr. Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake City on that trip for a " holiday " following a meeting in Atlanta . <p> Gifts and Entertainment <p> Some gifts , particularly those with a Utah theme , were given uniformly to each IOC member ; other gifts were personalized for individual members . Several prominent IOC members were given personalized gifts in recognition of their positions within the Olympic Family . The value of these gifts ran from $ 200 to $ 9,000 . For instance , IOC President Samaranch was given a $ 9,000 limited edition pistol , which was donated by Browning . Norwegian IOC member Jan Staubo was presented with replica model airplane of the Spitfire he flew for the Norwegian Air Force during World War II . Stein Erickson , whose brother had flown next to Mr. Staubo and was killed in battle , presented the airplane to Mr. Staubo . These personalized gifts were intended to strengthen ties between the recipient and the Salt Lake City bid campaign . Presentations of these gifts typically occurred in the presence of other people ; Bid Committee representatives and Trustees have never denied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not so personalized . Some IOC guests expressed an interest in shopping trips for themselves or their companions . While some of this shopping was paid for by the visitors , much of it was paid for by the Bid Committee . Shopping often took place with a Bid Committee representative present who would charge the purchases on a personal charge card for subsequent reimbursement by the Bid Committee . <p> In addition , at least two major department stores had pledged sizeable VIK donations to the Bid Committee . Purchases made at these stores were charged against a pre-arranged credit line on store accounts . We received a summary from one participating department store that itemizes purchases totaling a $ 25,000 VIK contribution . Of this amount , $ 8,017 was expended on clothing items , $ 7,054 for fragrances , $ 2,560 for luggage and the remainder for sundry categories . ... <p> Other entertainment was more public , including catered banquets , sports events ( such as Utah Jazz basketball games ) , cultural performances ( such as the Utah Symphony ) and recreational excursions ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell ) . Some group activities were conducted in full view of the public . For example , large numbers of IOC members were honored during half-time breaks at Utah Jazz games and were presented with Jazz collectibles . <p> Like the gift-giving , some of the entertainment was more personalized . Many IOC members were taken skiing , and others were taken on trips to Moab , Yellowstone Park , Las Vegas and even Florida for the Super Bowl . ... <p> Among the IOC members who visited Salt Lake City , Jean-Claude Ganga merits special mention . Many witnesses before the Board of Ethics described Mr. Ganga as the IOC member who most took advantage of the Bid Committee 's and the community 's generosity ; indeed , Bid Committee and SLOC expenditures attributable to the Ganga family total more than $ 250,000 . <p> Starting in August 1993 , Mr. Ganga became a frequent guest of the Bid Committee . While it is typical for an IOC member and a companion to make a single site visit to a bid city , Mr. Ganga visited Salt Lake City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variously by his wife , Eugenie , his son , Jean-Jacques , and his mother-in-law , Pauline Biyendolo . Since 1990 , the total amount paid by the Bid Committee and the Organizing Committee for the travel expenses of Mr. Ganga and his family amounted to more than $ 115,000 ; meals and lodging for the Gangas cost the Bid Committee $ 13,900 . <p> During their many trips to Salt Lake City , Mr. Ganga and his family members received extensive medical care . For example , Mr. Ganga was treated for hepatitis , his mother-in-law underwent knee replacement surgery , and his wife had cosmetic surgery . Some medical expenses were covered by health insurance . Other medical expenses were paid directly by the Bid Committee . However , the bulk of the medical expenses were furnished without charge by the health care providers . ... The Bid Committee directly paid $ 17,172.37 for health care expenses for Mr. Ganga . <p> Direct Payments <p> In late 1993 , the Bid Committee began a series of direct payments to Charles Mukora , an IOC member from Kenya . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a Kenyan NOC program , he acknowledges that the other payments were for Mr. Mukora 's personal use . From November 1993 through May 1995 , Mr. Mukora received direct payments of Bid Committee funds in the amount of $ 34,650 . ... <p> In December 1993 and January 1994 , two direct payments of Bid Committee funds were made to Sergio Santander-Fantini , a member of the IOC from Chile , who also served as the President of the Chilean National Olympic Committee throughout the bid period . Both checks , totaling $ 20,050 , lack proper documentation . While the Bid Committee 's files contain no information related to these payments , interviews conducted by the Board of Ethics revealed that they were authorized by Mr. Welch and used for Mr. Santander 's political campaign . ... <p> On October 10 , 1994 , Mr. Johnson received a fax from the Bid Committee 's consultant , Muttaleb Ahmad , requesting that the Bid Committee send $ 1,000 per month to the " daughter " of General Gadir , the IOC member from Sudan . From recent admissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no daughter named " Zema , " but rather that this is a pseudonym for General Gadir himself . Mr. Johnson responded immediately to the request , without any apparent knowledge of the existence of Zema Gadir and wire transfers began two weeks later . In any event , there is little , if any , difference between these " direct payments " made to IOC members and the " assistance " given to relatives of IOC members , particularly where Bid Committee officials did not attempt to ascertain whether there was a legitimate educational purpose for the payments .
