Letter from the Unknown <P> Sir : <P> As you can imagine , I was astonished and delighted at the review of my book , Brazen Chariots Feb. 1 . I think it significant and reassuring that a magazine of your standing can select a book by an author who is not only unknown but a foreigner . On behalf of all foreign unknowns , I thank you . <P> <P> ROBERT CRISP Ipswich , England <P> Voices in the Wilderness <P> Sir : <P> Your cover article on aviation safety Feb. 22 was timely , interesting and informative . However , somebody besides the flying public was vitally interested in air safety , even in the " pre-Quesada " days : the airline pilot . We pilots frequently sounded like voices in the wilderness . Flight safety is , always has been , and always will be our most important product . <P> A. G. ANDERSON American Air Lines Lombard , Ill . <P> Sir : <P> It is ludicrous to assume that when Ted Curtis ' report said that the Federal Aviation Agency should be run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his uniform off . Your article was good , well written and obviously very well researched . But I sometimes get the feeling that Quesada thinks the cone of silence is the lull after a general gives an order . <P> <P> W. C. HELLER Airline Captain Flourtown , Pa . <P> <P> PROTEST FROM A KING <P> SIR : <P> WE WISH TO VOICE OUR GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT , SHOCK AND SURPRISE AT THE OUTRAGEOUS PIECE OF POOR-QUALITY REPORTING IN YOUR FEB. 15 ISSUE . IT IS NOT BEFITTING ONE OF THE GREATEST MAGAZINES OF OUR DAY . IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE THERE ARE SET AND KNOWN ETHICAL STANDARDS . THE PRESS HAS GREAT WEIGHT AND IMPORTANCE IN OUR LIVES , AND THEREFORE ITS COMPLIANCE WITH ETHICAL STANDARDS SHOULD BE NOBLER AND PROPORTIONATE TO THE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY IT CARRIES . TIME HAS AN EVEN HEAVIER ONE DUE TO THE POSITION IT OCCUPIES IN WORLD PUBLIC OPINION . IT SHOULD , IN MY VIEW , ABIDE BY THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ACCURATE , RESPONSIBLE REPORTING . IT SHOULD SET AN EXAMPLE . THIS I SUGGEST BECAUSE I FEEL THAT A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SAME WAY THAT IT BELONGS TO ITS <P> OWNERS . <P> THE CROWN PRINCE , MY BROTHER , ENJOYS MY FULL CONFIDENCE AND BACKING . I AM PROUD OF WHAT HE HAS BECOME AT HIS AGE . I AM CONFIDENT THAT HE IS AND ALWAYS SHALL BE A HASHEMITE , HUMBLE , YET PROUD OF THE FACT THAT AS HASHEMITES WE HAVE ALWAYS SERVED THIS ARAB NATION , OUR NATION , WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN OUR TITLES OR POSITIONS . WE DO NOT CLAIM INFALLIBILITY : WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES , WE ALL HAVE OUR FAULTS . <P> THE STRUGGLE HERE IN THIS AREA TAKES VARIOUS FORMS , INCLUDING WHAT PRINCE MOHAMMED AND MYSELF HAVE FACED IN THE WAY OF SLANDEROUS ATTACKS SUCH AS THE RUMORS YOU HAVE PRINTED ABOUT MY BROTHER , WHICH EMANATED SOLELY AND SUBVERSIVELY FROM POLITICAL RIVALRIES IN THE ARAB WORLD . MONARCHY , NOT MY BROTHER , WAS THE TARGET . I AM ASTONISHED THAT YOUR EDITORS DID NOT FIRST INVESTIGATE THEM , AND SECOND RECOGNIZE THEIR PURPOSE . <P> AS FOR MONARCHY ITSELF , I BELIEVE THAT ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT IS AS GOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOOD AS THE PERSONS WHO ARE IN POWER . WE WELCOME RESPONSIBLE CRITICISM TO SHOW US OUR MISTAKES . YET WE FEEL THAT IN COMPARISON BETWEEN JORDAN AND OTHER TYPES OF GOVERNMENTS IN THIS AREA WE HAVE REASON TO FEEL A LITTLE PROUD OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS . <P>
