PARIS , Nov. ** Herbert V. Evatt , president of the United Nations General Assembly , called on the Big Four tonight to settle their dispute over Berlin . He insisted that the area of disagreement between the Soviet Union and the Western powers had been reduced to that " between tweedledum and tweedledee . " He proposed that the Big Four utilize the technical study of the deadlock over the Berlin currency question now being prepared under the direction of Secretary General Trygve Lie . Dr. Evatt said Mr. Lie 's effort to produce a compromise settlement had been undertaken on his advice . The Secretary General conferred today with Dr. Juan Atilio Bramuglia , this month 's chairman of the Security Council , who played a leading part in the earlier efforts by the representatives of the six Council members not directly concerned to solve the Berlin deadlock . Dr. Evatt declared that the deadlock over Berlin had produced a blighting effect on this session of the General Assembly . He asserted that the Mexican resolution adopted by the General Assembly unanimously a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comply with the measures proposed . The resolution requested - the // EVATT ASKS . BIG 4 TO ACT ON BERLIN // great powers to redouble their efforts to reach an agreement on peace treaties with Germany , Japan and Austria and recommended that they ask the other Allied countries that had taken part in the war to assist them . It is understood that Dr. Evatt feels that such participation by the small powers could be carried out either in the Security Council or in the General Assembly but that in any event it is incumbent upon the Big Four to make greater efforts to reach agreement , first on the Berlin dispute and later on the treaties . No action on the Berlin question has been taken by the Security Council since Oct. 25 when Andrei Y. Vishinsky , Soviet delegate , vetoed the compromise resolution presented by the " neutral " representatives.Calls for Greater Effort Dr. Evatt is understood to feel that the Mexican resolution creates an entirely new situation and that the Big Four should take prompt action to carry out the Assembly 's recommendations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a leading role in the efforts by the small powers to take a more active part in drafting the peace treaties with Italy and the Axis satellites , is understood to believe that the peace treaty with Germany should come first and those with Japan and Austria later . In any event , he is known to feel , strongly that the Mexican resolution must not be allowed to become a dead letter . In the event the Big Four take no steps to comply with the resolution , it is believed he intends to bring up the question himself either in a speech to the General Assembly next week or by direct contact with the Big Four delegations at the Assembly session . A. H. Feller , United Nations General Counsel , is directing the studies requested by Mr. Lie and Dr. Evatt and hopes to complete them within a week . These studies are understood to be based on the hope of producing proposals acceptable to both sides on the points clearly stated in the Aug. 30 Moscow directive . These points called for the simultaneous lifting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout Berlin . Other points on which the directive was not clear or that , like the question of occupation costs , could be settled only by direct negotiation among-the Big Four , would be left for later settlement . Some members of the United States delegation are skeptical over the possibility of reaching any agreement through this procedure , declaring it corresponds to rival " pleadings " submitted by respective lawyers in a case before it goes to trial . However , the United States delegation already is furnishing the information needed by Mr. Feller for his study . Moreover , according to usually well-informed sources , Gen. Lucius D. Clay , United States Military Governor , is getting restive over the failure to reach  --  a settlement in the United Nations and is now pressing his earlier demand that the Western " B " mark be established permanently in the Western sectors of Berlin . United States delegation sources here insisted , however , that the United States was not attempting to hurry the decision in the United Nations . General Clay 's proposal on the Western mark was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " these sources said , but no decision will be made until it is known definitely what prospect exists of getting a settlement ' in the United Nations . It is believed , however , that in any event a decision of such importance would not be made without a personal report to President Truman from Secretary of State Marshall .
