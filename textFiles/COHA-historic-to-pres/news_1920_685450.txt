Governor Alfred E .. Smith and Charles F. Murphy left here tonight for Chicago after a week 's devotion to golf , and , by way of recreation , exchange of political views with former Senator Thomas Taggart of . Indiana . Concerning the former they were enthusiastic , but on the subject of politics they had nothing to say , again insisting that they had come to French Lick for rest and to get into condition in anticipation of strenuous days at San Francisco . Both Governor Smith and Mr. Murphy are noticeably in better trim than when they came here . Governor Srptth , although a beginner , has become an ardent golfer , and many of those earnest discussions snapped by enterprising photographers flocking here to film the Tammany vacationists have been nothing more startling ? than the usual " If I had n't got into the tall grass I would have made that hole in bogey . " But both Governor Smith and Mr. Murphy are too good politicians to let an opportunity go by . With Taggart they have many things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obvious when information came here today of Mc.Adoo 's refusal to permit his name going before the Democratic Convention . Furthermore , they are agreed that- Bryan should be muzzled and against an extreme interpretation of the Eighteenth Amendment . Taggart for " Moist " Platform . Only this morning when he was presented with what was alleged- to have been an exhibit ? from the Smithsonian Institution , a mint julep , Mr. Taggart told delegates to an insurance convention in session here that he was " in favor of a moist platform in California . " " Moist " is a word in great favor in the Middle West as a tactful ? definition of a " near wet " who is not a " wringing wet . " Incidentally Taggart referred to his ambition to return to the Senate and hoped that his " friends would not like me too well and try to keep ' me in Indiana . " If there have been any causes for disagreement between Tammany and Taggart it w ould have been the Irish question . There are no evidences that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but close friends of his say that the former Indiana Senator has declared that even if the party lost votes by such a course it would be better for the Democratic platform to contain no reference to the " Irish ' Republic . " There are no indications that any agreement has been concluded as to any candidate for the Democratic nomination . Taggart has had a good word for Vice President Marshall and Governor Cox , and today , when news came of aleAdoo 's renunciation , he said : " You can say for me that means Mr. Marshall will be the next President. ? ' . Senator/ Mark A. Smith of Arizona has also said kind things about Marshall , while announcing that the Southwest would support if the latter were a candidate . lE  --  ralsea . Davis While predicting Marshall as the next President , Mr. Taggart praised Davis highly , and said that the Ambassador 's chances would be better if he were in this country . Neither . Governor Smith nor Mr. Murphy would commit themselves publicly on any . candidate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discussions is that Murphy will keep the . New York delegation lined up fer Smith , under the unit'rule , and then , after bargaining in San Francisco , back the wirmer.  - -  mctiss similar to those of the Peringylvania delegation at the Republican convention at Chicago . - When an attempt was made to interest George W. - Perkins in various candidates for the Republican nomination his repeated reply was " my interest politically Is not ? who ' but ' what . ' " To this Tammany utters a loud and hungry " Amen . " Aside from using the New York State delegation 's complimentary vote for Governor Smith as a lever , the indications are that the only " who " Tarn many leaders are Interested In is the candidate giving them the " what . " From the best information that can be ' obtained here , what Tammany wants at the San Francisco convention is a moist or . wet platform , sympathy for the Irish Republic " and a candidate who , should he he elected , would remember his New York friends .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
