with Herman Redpath I will arise from the dead and shine too . How beautiful upon the mountain , Antonio , are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings . You can read it for yourself when you 've had your coffee . One hundred thousand dollars is what it says . One hundredthousand dollars to my loyal friend and pastor Leo Bebb . " I had never seen him more excited . I was still half asleep , and the whole room seemed to be turning to gold , the shallow pool of sunshine where he was standing , sun on the will , sun drenching the curtains , sun on my pillow and in my eyes . He said , " Think what a man could do with a sum like that , Antonio . " " I do hereby devise and bequeath , " I read out loud with my hair in my eyes . " To my loyal friend and pas-tor . " Bebb said , " There is absolutely nothing in the  --  hardly anything in this world a man could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my bedside dressed for Herman Redpath 's funeral in his gents ' - furnishings suit with his shoulders too square and his ribbed silk tie and his pointed black shoes , and " Expensive clothes , " I said , " and expensive women and an air-conditioned Cadillac automobile and color TV in every room . For openers . " Bebb was not listening . He was dreaming . He was glittering in the morning sunshine , his face powdery pale . He said , " Yes , that is so , Antonio . All the kingdoms of the earth spread out at my feet like a wall-to-wall rug . My father was a house painter . He took a bad fall when I was small and spent most of the rest of his life in bed . His fingernails were always dirty . I never did see how ap37man could get his fingernails dirty just laying around in bed all the time , but he did . Someday I will tell you more about him . My mother was a hard-working woman , a good woman , but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without charity her goodness did n't profit anybody anything , herself included . Makes you wonder what a pair like that would have done with a hundred thousand dollars in cash money . They would n't have even believed it , most likely . " I had never thought of his having had a mother and father . I said , " Tell me more , Bip . " The one lazy eyelid flickered down for a moment , and I was afraid I had put him on his guard . He said , " Antonio , I will tell you this much for now . I was born and raised outside of Spartanburg , South Carolina , and that is where I got acquainted with sin and death for the first time , and many other things besides . The first time I got acquainted with death was in the railway depot . I do n't suppose I was more than six . There was a big , long box sitting out on a hand car waiting to be loaded on to the Atlanta train , and I asked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to say , naturally , what was in it , but I wormed it out of her . She said it was a dead man was in it being shipped to the crematory with his name written out on the shipping labels just like there was horse feed in there or dry goods . The peculiar thing , Antonio , is I knew it was n't a dead man . I knew it was a dead woman . It was an old woman , and I could see her in there plain as if I had x-ray eyes . Now you explain that any way you want . She had got on a pair of pink bloomers and a summer dress , and they 'd put sticking plaster over her mouth , do n't ask me why . It was the first meeting between me and death , Antonio.  |p38I  have never forgotten it . " He was sitting on the edge of my bed with his hands on his knees looking down at the sun on the floor . I had a momentary impulse to run my finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue or a child . Instead , I said , " How about the first meeting between you and sin , Bip ? " Bebb said , " Around Spartanburg it 's a lot of good peach country . You would n't think so maybe to look at all the red clay , but it is . One summer they commenced dumping peaches to keep the price up . There was piles of peaches heaped up all along the sides of the roads and in the orchards . Antonio , there was peaches every place you looked nearly  --  big , pinky-yellow , juicy peachesIII enough to make your mouth water  --  and there they were , going brown and rotten in the sun . It made you sick the same way as sin makes you sick . " His jaw snapped shut as though on a spring . Bebb said , " Sin is waste , Antonio . Sin is life wasted . I Now you take this , " he added . Reaching forward he took the last will and testament of Herman Redpath out of my hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that means nothing is wasted . Everybody has come in for his share , Antonio . I 'm fixing to explain it all out later at the funeral . " Someone was knocking at my bedroom door , but Bebb took no notice of it . " Jesus has come in for his share too , " he said . " A trust has been created to take care of the operating expenses of Gospel Faith College , and there wo n't have to be any " Closing Out " sign hung up on the door of Holy Love either . I wanted you to be among the first to know , Antonio . Nobody has been left out in the cold , not even Jesus . "  |p39I  said , " Maybe that 's Jesus now . The knocking . " It was Brownie . He had been off on some errand for Bebb when I had arrived the day before , and I got out of bed now to greet him . He said , " I 'm sorry for the sad occasion that 's brought us together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bower with his after-shave . Laverne Brown , known as Brownie , was Bebb 's Leporelloor Hans Sachs . If Bebb was Hardy , Brownie was Laurel . As Dean of Gospel Faith , Brownie was the one who checked through all the eight by eleven doublespacedbook summaries submitted for advanced theologicaldegrees and Brownie was the one who in purple ink personally signed all the diplomas . As assistant pastor of Holy Love , Brownie was chief Biblical exegete , and under his masterful touch Jesus ' cursing the fig tree for not bearing figs when the Messiah happened by even though it was n't fig season became a word of assurance and hope , and even the dashing of the little ones against the stones in Psalm 137 was revealed as a blessing in disguise . Brownie called everybody " dear " irrespective of age or gender . He wore glasses that were rimless exceptat the tops where there were rims of heavy tortoise shell which made him look intense and harried . But the key to Brownie was his smile , that benediction of china teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " properly is first to form your mouth as if to say " o " and then to say " ee " instead . The way to do Brownie 's smile properly is first to form the expression of a man who has just been kicked in the crotch and then to say " cheese . " Brownie turned to Bebb and said , " I was just over to the church checking on the flowers , and I thought I ought to let you know that I noticed a certain personp40hanging around outside again . Mrs. Bebb said she found him in the gift shop when she got over and he bought five postcards of you . She said afterwards when she come to look at the money he 'd given her , she found this . " Bebb took the object that Brownie handed him and examined it carefully . It had apparently come from one of those machines they used to have in the waiting rooms of big railway stations where you put a quarter in a slot and , by turning a wheel with the alphabet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum disc about the size of a fifty cent piece . The one that Brownie handed Bebb had no name on it , however , but just the word SWEETHEART . On the upper rim were printed the words coon LUCK . " Good luck , Sweetheart , " Brownie said . Bebb put the piece in his pocket and said , " Brownie , did he say anything to you when you saw him ? " " He was standing out there in the wet grass like he was reading the bulletin board , " Brownie said , " I told him the church was going to be closed to the public todaybecause we were conducting a private funeral . " Bebb said , " What did he say when you told him that ? " They were standing together in the morning sunlight : Bebb had the knob of his chin thrust forward a little , the flesh beneath it slightly in motion . He was the bull , and Brownie , with his teeth , was the china shop . Brownie said , " He did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and started walking away . The bottoms of his trousers were all wet from the grass . That man must weight a good two hundred and seventy-five stripped . "  |p41Bebb  said , " You strip him , Brownie . " He stood there at the window looking out with his thumbs linked behind him . Without turning around , he said , " Antonio , some of those big government agencies wo n't stop at anything . The Federal Trade Commission , the U.S. Post Office Department , the Better Business Bureau , you name it . I 've had my set-to 's with all of them on account of Gospel Faith , and one time or another they 've all sent plainclothesmen down here to snoop around . He 's one of them probably . " " Why do n't you ask him ? " I said . Brownie said , " Dear , that is just the trouble . Up till today he never come close enough to talk to . Before , you might catch sight of him looking out at you through the dime-store window or hanging around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house for Rotary , but he never come near enough so as you could get a chance to have a conversation with him . " I said , " Maybe he 's bashful . " Brownie said , " Maybe he is , dear . " Like Bebb , he had on a dark suit for Herman Redpath 's service . The back of his hand was hairy as he reached up to straighten his glasses . Bebb said , " Good luck sweetheart . You do n't generally wish a man good luck unless you think he 's going to need it . " What 's he look like ? " I asked . Bebb said , " He looks flat . He looks like he was cut out with a cookie-cutter . " " Flat , " Brownie said , " but wide . Very wide , dear . " When Bebb picked Herman Redpath 's will off thebed to put it back in his pocket , the reflection of it flickeredin the window like a white bird . He said , " If youp42stick around for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio . " I did stick around , of course  --  for the funeral that morning and for the burial afterwards  --  and before I caught the plane back north , I did get a look at him as Bebb had predicted , but not before getting a look at a variety of other things first . There were times during the funeral when I could n't believe what I was looking at and these are the times I remember best . There were no special pews reserved for the family because one way or another they were all family . I took a place near Mrs. Trionka toward the back because it gave me a good view of the whole church , and when I was settled down I said a kind of prayer for Herman Redpath . I tried to picture him and his maker sweating it out together the way Bebb had described it and wished them both a happy issue out of their labors . When that was finished , I passed the time until the service was to begin by seeing how many of the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of them drifted together like snow in their flowing white dresses , several rows in front of their mother and me , and I had no trouble with Harry Hocktaw or the small boy who had urinated on Herman Redpath 's chair . I recognized the woman who had offered Herman Redpath her breast and the old woman who for the first time in my experience was wearing not a peekaboo blouse but something high-collared and Victorian that buttoned up the back . I looked a long time for Lucille before I discovered her sitting by herself in the choir loft with her dark glasses in place . There were also a few children whose faces Ip43remembered from one visit or another , and of course there was Herman Redpath himself . The coffin was open , and by raising myself slightly in my pew I could just see his nose jutting up out of the white satin like the fin of a shark . It was n't until everybody stood up for the opening hymn that I discovered that several members of the congregationwere as far as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered here and there among the fully clothed ones , and apart from their nakedness they did n't seem to have anything else in common , some male and some female , some old and some young . They did not turn out to have any special role to play in the serviceeither but just stood up and sat down with the rest of us . I convinced myself at one point that they were possibly a little taller and handsomer than the others and wondered if they could have been special favorites of Herman Redpath 's who were using this device to say so . Or was it conceivably their way of dramatizing that they had been dealt with inadequately in the will and thus sadly reduced ? Or could it just be a fanciful response to the Texas heat that day ? I do n't know . When I asked Bebb later , he said he did n't know either . In any case , nobody seemed to pay them any particular attention , and I am surprised how quickly I reached the point myself where a bare brown shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a straw hat or a hymn book . After the funeral was over , Bebb was able to explain to me at least something about the eccentric behavior of John Turtle , but at the time I was unprepared for it . Bebb said , " Seems like every one of your big family groups has got what they call a Joking Cousin , and forp44Herman Redpath 's family group it 's John Turtle . A Joking Cousin 's main job is to make jokes , but he does n't make your run-of-the-mill jokes , and he does n't make them at run-of-the-mill times either . Say there 's a marriagebeing arranged and the heads of both families are there all dressed up to make terms . Or say a man 's dying or just died and the women have come over to pay their last respects . Maybe a girl gets herself in trouble , and there 's a pow-wow what to do about finding her a husband . These are solemn times , you might say dangeroustimes , Antonio . Times when things come out in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot to handle  --  life and death things , Antonio . And they 're the times when the Joking Cousin does his stuff . Seems as if the Joking Cousin is the Indians themselves mocking and blaspheming their own holiest things so as nobody else will . Seems to me like an Indian thinks if he makes out the holiest things and times he 's got are n't worth spit , maybe then the evil spirits will be fooled into letting the holy things alone . Maybe even God will let them alone then , Antonio . " I do n't know about Bebb 's explanation . I know only that at the funeral of Herman Redpath at Holy Love , John Turtle played the part of the Joking Cousin . John Turtle turned out to be the one who had teeth like cufflinksand had told me he could n't hear or see Harry Hocktaw 's rattle . " I am the resurrection and the life , " Bebb said from the pulpit pale as death , and John Turtle stood behind him holding two fingers up over Bebb 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eulogy of Herman Redpath by giving out the details of the will  --  explaining how even from the grave Herman Redpath would con/tinue to finance the ranch indefinitely and everyone was going to have his share including Jesus  --  John Turtle picked his nose on the chancel steps . At several points in the service , he even tried to get Bebb to enter into dialogue with him . " The Lord is my shepherd , I shall not want , " Bebb read from the lectern , his face glistening with perspiration , and " I know what you want right enough , " John Turtle said from the foot of the casket . Bebb said , " He maketh me to lie down in green pastures , He leadeth me beside the still waters , " and John Turtle said , " I know a girl what lives on a hill . If she wo n't do it , her sister will . " You have to hand it to Bebb . He never batted an eye . " Chicka-chicka boom , chicka-boom , chicka-boom , " went the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle all through the Lord 's Prayer . And duringone of the hymns he ate a piece of fruit . When he finished it , he made the motions of turning a crank in his neck and made his head tilt slowly backward like an anti-aircraft gun . When he reached maximum elevation , he turned another crank to make his head swivel around to face the congregation . With his lips puckered out to a point and his cheeks puffed he waited until the Amen came and then pulled one ear to fire . The fruit pit flew out toward the front pews with a pop . Unlike the small boy in the orange life preserver , nobodycame up to snatch the Joking Cousin away when just after the benediction he walked over and either took or pretended to take a leak into Herman Redpath 's open coffin . Oddly enough , the most vivid memory I have of HermanRedpath 's obsequies involves none of these extraor/dinary events but one which was comparatively speaking rather ordinary . The whole congregation was standing up for a hymn , and when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate that everybody was to sit down and said in his pulpit voice , " Brothers and sisters , let us bow our heads in prayer . " As far as I could tell , everybodyobeyed and sat down and bowed their heads . I bowed my head too but not so far as to keep me from seeing what was going on . At first I thought that for once there was nothing going on . Bebb was praying his prayer , getting more and more vehement with God about something . Even John Turtle was for the moment quiet . The Indians had arrangedthemselves in varying attitudes of worship and inattention  --  some with their faces in their hands or their foreheads resting on the pew in front of them , some half-sitting and half-kneeling , several with their heads down almost in their laps as if they were trying to keep themselves from being sick . A few pews in front of me I noticed that the shoulders of one of the Trionka girls were heaving and wondered if it was from grief or some dark spasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head cradled in his arms on the pew in front of him , and under one arm I could see the hair dark and luxuriant as fur . It was n't for some moments that I glanced in the other direction and discovered that one member of the congregation had remained on his feet . He was standing there with his hands in his pockets , and as soon as I saw him , I knew that he was the stranger Bebb and Brownie had been discussing that morning . From shoulder to shoulder , hip to hip , he was a very wide man , and anybody meeting him head-on would have thought he was enormous . Seeing him from thep47side , however , I appreciated the accuracy of Bebb 's remark about the cookie-cutter . From back to front he was not enormous , and the only place where his thickness came near to matching his width was below the waist . It was not a paunch because it was too low for that and too spread out laterally . It was as if he was wearing some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loins , a massive eave of flesh swelling out over his crotch . His face was sallow and wrinkled , but when for no apparent reason he smiled at one point , his teeth showed strong and white and young . It was the smile of a pretty girl . There he stood in the midst of Holy Love , cumbersome , relaxed , while all around him everybody else includingmyself were sitting or kneeling with our heads bowed . What made the moment so peculiarly vivid , I suppose , was the sense I had that he was the one we were bowing to . Bebb went on praying with his eyes screwed tight shut , and when the stranger smiled that oddly gay and youthful smile , it seemed a kind of graceful acknowledgementthat even the prayer was addressed to him . After the service was over , I hoped that I could get close enough to hear what his voice sounded like , perhapseven to speak to him , but I lost him in the crowd while I was waiting to shake hands with Bebb on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . He was way off beyond the parking lot by then , drifting along through the high grass like an oddly shaped swarm of bees . Later that afternoon when we had come back from the cemetery , Bebb and Lucille drove me to the airport top48catch my plane home . Brownie came along for the ride , and when it turned out that the plane was going to be more than an hour late , Lucille insisted we all go into the lounge for some refreshment . Through the picture window you could see planes landing and taking off into the hot , pearly sky . Bebb and Brownie both had iced tea , and I joined Lucille in an airport lounge version of a Tropicana . After a while Lucille said , " Golden , Brownie . When he bought those postcards , I asked him what his name was , and he said his name was Golden . " It was a statement , but she left it hanging like a question . Bebb seemed remote and preoccupied , watching a big airlinergo taxiing down the runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , Lucille behind her black glasses and Brownie behind his horn rims . " That 's one for the books , " Lucille said . Brownie smiled dimly . He said , " I 've heard stranger names than that in my time . I knew a boy once named ToeWater . Fred ToeWater . " There was another long , interrogatory silence during which Lucille lifted her glass to her lips and stared at Brownie over the rim of it , her eyebrows raised . It was like some obscure kind of chess . She said finally , " Golden'sa Jewish name . " Brownie said , " Some of my very dear friends are Jew-ish . " Lucille said , " If that man 's Jewish , I 'm a nigger . " Bebb turned slightly more toward the window like a man stirring in his sleep . Over the loudspeaker a voice read a long list of flight numbers . Brownie placed his hands palms down on the table in front of him . He wore three rings which looked like fraternity rings and ap49gold spring-band watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " What are you getting at , dear ? " Lucille dropped her lower jaw slightly . She said , " You tell me . " Brownie shrugged his shoulders and laid one hand on top of the other . Lucille said , " He 's no more Jewish than Bebb is , but when I asked him what his name was , he said it was Golden . That 's Jewish . " " Are you inferring that Golden is an alias , dear ? " Brownie said . Lucille said , " The only thing I 'm inferring is supposehe had n't said his name was Golden . Suppose he said it was Silver . " For the first time it looked as though Brownie knew what she was talking about . He was clearing his throat with the air of a man stepping backwards to get a runningstart when Bebb turned abruptly from the window . His face looked vigorous and fresh like a man newly awakened from a good dream . He said , " Brownie , how 'd you like to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a long , hot day . I was starting to feel a little drowsy from the Tropicana , and did n't listen as carefully as I might have otherwise to the conversation that followed . When I got home late that evening , Sharon was irritated by my incomplete and garbled account of it . She said , " My God , all our lives are at stake and you were n't even listening . What kind of a peckerheadare you anyway ? " And of course she was right . One way or another our lives were at stake.  |p50All  the time Bebb had been praying in his maroon robe with the sweat running down , all the time John Turtle had been trying to distract the evil spirits or God or whoever it was , all the time we had stood there under the low clouds waiting until Herman Redpath 's urinestainedcoffin was finally lowered into the Texas soil , Bebb had apparently been making plans . There in the airport against a backdrop of silver wings and pewter clouds he had revealed them rapidly , one after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody 's ear . What I remembered best was how he talked about the money Herman Redpath had left him . " One hundredthousand in cash , Antonio , with no strings attached , " and he made it dance there , stringless , on the Formica before us . The money was power , it was promise , it was all the benevolence of IIerman Redpath rolled into one . The money was freedom and adventure and fun , and as he stacked his words higher and higher , I wondered if he was thinking of his bed-ridden father again with the dirty fingernails in Spartanburg , South Carolina , and the piles of golden peaches abandoned along the roads to keep the price up . " The sky is the limit , " he said  --  the sky behind his bald head looking electric and dangerous  --  and he stuck his finger into his tea and stirred the ice around until it rattled . Herman Redpath had endowed both Holy Love and Gospel Faith in perpetuity , saecula saeculorum , so he , Bebb , was no longer needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watered it with the sweat of his brow and tended the young shoots , and now he would leave it to Brownie to supervise the harvesting . Even Brownie should be able to handle things from here onp51out , Bebb said , and Brownie sat there in his short sleeves with his undershirt showing through the dark stains at the armpits letting his low-hung rack of teeth do his smiling for him . Bebb said , " Antonio , I have heard the voice of the Lord saying , Whom shall I send ? ' and I have said , Here am I. Leo Bebb . Send me . ' I have labored in these Texas vineyards long enough . I may not be the man I once was , but I am not an old man yet either . There are souls to be saved same as there always was and always will be , and one hundred thousand dollars will take me a long piece down the road toward saving them . Indians are n't the only lost sheep of the House of Israel . " Lucille said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and drew one horizontal hand across her face at nose level , knocking her glasses crooked along the way . " That Turtlewas n't just pretending to piss on Herman Redpath . I was sitting upstairs by myself , and I could look right down and see it soaking into the Navajo blanket . Show me an Indian , " she said , " and I 'll show you a slob . I 'm getting out of here if I have to push a peanut with my nose clear to Savannah . " Bebb talked about the North , I remember , with such poetry and zeal that it took me a while before I was sure what he was talking about . " The pilgrim 's pride , " he said . " The place they landed at in their old-time hats with buckles on their shoes and kneeled right down on that rock-bound coast with the waves pounding in their ears to return thanks to the Almighty . I am proud to be a Southerner born and bred , Antonio , but North is where the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this very day . North is where the money is . North is where the power is . And the greatp52whore is in the North too , Antonio , holding a golden cup in her hand full of the abominations and filthiness of her fornications . We have not been called to sit on our tails by the swimming pool forever and break bread with multi-millionaires of Indian descent . We are called to the North where the fighting is thickest . That 's where we must work and fight while we can , for the night is coming . At any moment the end may come , Antonio . Like a thief in the night . " It was on this part of my report that Sharon questionedme most closely later . Did Bip mean that he was coming north to us ? Could he possibly mean that he and Lucille were going to live in our house ? Did he plan to create a new Holy Love right there with Tony going around hanging up African violets in his jock strap and me having a hemorrhage every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he say when he was coming  --  like next year or next month or next week ? I failed miserably to give her the information she wanted . It was the rhetoric I remembered , not the facts . I was n't even sure whether Bebb himself had given facts . I was sure that there was no need to start emptying bureau drawers that night , I told her , but that was all I was sure of . The boys had both gone to bed before I got home , and the baby was asleep . The house was stuffy and still smelled of hamburger and onions so we were sitting outsideunder the spring stars . Even outside it was very warm , but , unlike Houston , there was at least a little movement in the air . When I finished my lame recital , Sharon did something she had learned in yoga maybe . I was lying face down in the damp grass , and she got up and stood on my back in her bare feet . She stood on thep53small of my back . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between my shoulder blades . I could feel the cool soles of her feet through my shirt , and sometimes when she changed position the weight of her pressed the breath right out of me , but I could also feel it ironing out all the soreness and snarls left by my hours of sleeplessness the night before and by the long flight north and by my memories of how Herman Redpath 's nose had looked jutting up out of the white satin . Being stepped on almost put me to sleep before she was through , but she did n't let it . I was lying on my stomach , and she slipped one bare foot underneath me and did something unexpected and just painful enough down there to remind me that where her foot had touched was also part of who I was and that the three whole days and nights I had been away , it too had been living , however obscure and neglected , a life of its own which she restored now , that accomplished young acrobat , that speedy reader , that guitarist , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last words I ever heard him speak.  |p54z  SUPPOSE it is from my days as a schoolteacher and from my own school days that I have inherited the feeling that the year really starts in the fall . Fall is the time when the long dream of summer comes to an end and you settle down to the true business of your life . Spring , on the other hand , is the time of ending , and it is the season when I feel most vulnerable and anxious and haunted . Something more than just school is coming to a close , and all the poignant and beautiful things that are happening in nature only serve to heighten by contrast all the dim and disturbing things that are happening in me . For the first few days after I got back from Texas ,  |p55much  of this vague , floating malaise tended to attach itself to my uncertainty about what Bebb 's next move was going to be and Sharon 's growing horror that he and Lucille were probably about to arrive on our doorstep as permanent guests . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plans for fear of pushing him into something he might not yet quite have decided on so she just moved around from lesson to lesson in a somber , inflammablestate waiting for our doom to be announced . The boys stayed out of her way as much as they could , Chris drifting around the second floor like a ghost and even Tony making a visible effort to use up less oxygen than usual . As for me , I found sanctuary in the classroom . To teach a class , whether you do it well or badly , is to achieve fifty minutes worth of self-forgetfulness . More even than the long summer vacations , it is the principal side-benefit that the profession offers . Commencement was only a few weeks away . The seniors in my English class were still willing to go through the motions , but obviously they felt that the battle had already been either won or lost by then and in either case they were through battling . It was folly to try starting anything new with them at this point , but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the books had arrived and been paid for . It was King Lear , and the only bright side of our ill-timed study was that it was a play I loved myself . It is the one Shakespearean tragedy that I 've never been able to read without a lump in my throat . For various obscure scheduling reasons , the class met during one of the two lunch-time periods those last few weeks , and about half the students would come in with their trays and sit there eating Spanish rice and fruitp56jello while I tried to engage them in literary discussion . The day we started out on Lear there was gingerbread for dessert , and I can still remember the rosettes of ersatz whipped cream and the sound of the big electric mower working out on the playing field , the classroom smell of pencil shavings , floor cleaner and flatulence . Almost a week had gone by since Herman Redpath 's funeral , and although there was still no word from Bebb and no lightening either of Sharon 's dark mood or my springtime melancholia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to interest twenty adolescents in what one of them launched our discussion of Act I , Scene r , by describing as a boring fairy-tale . I decided not to try to hit back at " boring " directly but to get at it through " fairy-tale . " The one who had made the crushing remark was Laura Fleischman , a girl as golden as one of Bebb 's South Carolina peaches but still attached to the tree untouched , untasted , and to all appearances totally unaware that there was any danger of ending up by the roadside someday to go spoiled in the sun . I looked at her as I spoke , but my words were for all of them . I said she had made a shrewd observation . The openingscene was a kind of fairy-tale , or at least that was exactly what Shakespeare wanted us to believe . There was the old king surrounded by his court . There was the map of his kingdom divided up into three parts and the three royal princesses each to earn her part by telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the three wishes or the three caskets or the three riddles , I said , and the sisters themselves were straight out of Cinderella  --  Goneril and Regan so bitchy and Cordelia so sweet . The scene also ended on a Cinderella note , I pointedp57out . The bad sisters were to divide the whole kingdom between them and the good sister was banished to sit among the ashes in France . But anybody who knew anything about fairy-tales knew that this was only a temporaryset-back . It was only a matter of time before the fairy godmother would appear and the prince throw off his disguise because the endings of fairy-tales were always happy endings . Everybody knew that about fairy-tales , I said , looking into Laura Fleischman 's drowsy , lunch-hour eyes , and Shakespeare knew that everybody knew it . Only then as the play went on , I said , Shakespeare pulled a fast one . Because what he did in King Lear was to turn the fairy-tale upside down and paint it black . The bad ones came to a bad end but so did most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved and he became a human being at the end'but only long enough to see his beloved Cordelia get murdered by accident and to die whimpering over her corpse . I could not tell whether the moist look about Laura Fleischman 's eyes was the result of my eloquence or the little yawn she had managed to stifle so successfullythat only the swelling of her nostrils gave her away , but I remember that the rest of the class remained unmoved . Not all fairy-tales had happy endings , one boy said . There was the one about the tin soldier that fell into the fire , for instance . Somebody else said that now I 'd spoiled the whole thing by giving away the ending , and we spent the rest of the class in a profoundly unilluminatingargument about whether there had ever been an historical King Lear . I remember getting out of the room as quickly as possible as soon as the bell rang with the feeling that I had accomplished not just nothing but nothing minus . Before I 'd started working onp58them , they might have stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good turn-out for track practice anyway . As coach I was there in my usual baggy sweat suit with grass stains at the knees and a whistle around my neck , and I got the names down on my clipboard as one by one they straggled out , my hurdlers and sprinters and broad jumpers , my shot-putters and javelin throwers . They were a pretty seedy looking crowd with nothing much in the way of ability , but they worked hard that spring and had done quite well in competition . The only real star among them was my sixteen-year-old nephew , Tony Blaine , and everybody knew it including Tony himself . The pole vault was his specialty , but he had versatility and endurance enough to do well in almost any event . I had to put him in as a miler once , and he broke the school record . He was a natural athlete and took it seriously . He took his body seriously  --  watching his diet , lifting his weights , getting enough sleep  --  but there was nothing grim in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape the way a great lover might , as if he knew that the end he kept himself in shape for was in the last analysis not the most serious end a man could pursue or else so serious that , like the Joking Cousin , you did n't want to let on to the gods it was . He horsed around a lot . He was also very emotional  --  one of his bonds with Sharon was that they both cried at movies , even TV movies . He was also quick-tempered and in that way reminded me of his mother . As I watched him jogging around the cinder track naked to the waist and barefoot like something straight off the Parthenon , I thought of the mystery of human generation . My sister Miriam with her poor broken bonesp59Arcady turning to dust in a Brooklyn grave ; my exIrothcr-in-lawCharlie Blaine , that nap-taking valetudinariantrying to get through his life making as few waves as possible ; and out of their almost unthinkable passion this boy who was both of them and neither of them , this cocky godling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment carried in his belly the seed of unimaginableprogeny . He came running over to me with his ( lark hair in his eyes and that panicky , inward-looking frown that comes with being out of breath and panted out , " I wish to God you 'd tell Sharon not to hang around here in that get-up . " I had n't even seen her arrive . She must have driven over straight from the swami 's because she had on her black leotards as she lay there on one elbow in the grass . She had her hair tied back with a yellow scarf and was wearing hoop earrings . If she was aware of the stir she was causing among my sweaty charges , she gave no evidence of it . Shielding her eyes with one hand , she was squinting out to where beyond the track a solitary boy was practicing . He was running with a javelin at shoulder level , and the sun had turned the shaft of it to gold . She looked as though if she turned her thumb down , the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was thinking seriously about turning her thumb down . Tony , his bare chest heaving . The smell of the freshly mowed field in the sun . The boy with the golden spear . Sharon reclining there like Sheba herself or some Coptic call-girl with every lazy hill and valley of her young flesh exposed to the gaze of the circumcised and uncircumcisedboth . To my steaming nephew I said , " She is black but comely , 0 ye daughters of Jerusalem . There 's not an awful lot I can do about it , " and after looking asp60though he might bite his thumb at me and spit on the ground , he tossed the hair out of his eyes and went on back to his laps . That evening could n't have started out more auspiciously . Sharon and I had a drink before supper , and she took out her guitar and played a few songs  --  in ordinary conversation she was almost entirely without accent , but when she sang , she sounded decidedly Southern . She tried a setting Anita had taught her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " I know where I 'm going " and Donovan 's " Jennifer Juniper , " and after a while Chris came paddling downstairs to listen , and it was n't long before Tony was there too . He had forgotten all about his earlier irritation and sat on the arm of her chair reading the words over her shoulder . Except for the way we were dressed , we presented a family scene of almost Victorian felicity with Sharon and Tony the brother and sister or young newlyweds and me the benign avuncular presence . Tony and I were in khakis and shirtsleeves and Sharon in blue jeans , but Chris , though he had taken off his jacket , sat there with his necktie on , his loafers polished , and a crease in his pants . He could have been some resident cousin or visitingparson . All we lacked was Bill clapping dimpled hands at the sunset through the bay window , but he was still in his crib upstairs napping . From the kitchen came the smell of supper , and every once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peepers from the vacant lot across the street . ' We moved into the kitchen to eat . It would be interesting to know how it happened . Ip61suppose that when any group comes together , it is like a comic strip where in addition to the balloons where the words are , there are the clouds where the light bulbs and exclamation points and naked babes are , and sometimes the clouds collide without anybody 's being aware of it until all of a sudden there is a roll of thunder or in one corner of the room it starts to rain . At the level of the balloons nothing seemed to go wrong . I repeated some of what Bebb had told me about Joking Cousins . Chris got to laughing in his own curious style which involvednot laughing out ha-ha but laughing in in an asthmaticway with his head tossing back and forth and his steel-rimmed glasses fogging up . Tony repeated some crude gossip about Laura Fleischman which was completelyat odds with the impression she had given me that afternoon during the Lear class . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave no sign of taking offense at anything and seemed to join in whenever she felt like it . Then suddenly the first drops were starting to fall , heavy and cold . May had turned without warning into November . It is Chris I see , his colorless face and his wiry , colorlesshair that grew flat on his scalp like a cap . I see his father 's pale , noncommittal eyes looking out through his glasses . He has tied his bow tie himself but it looks like the kind you clip on . There is a tendency to pinkness around the underside of his nostrils that makes you think he has a slight cold . It is the face that he uses for doing his personal business behind . It is impossible to tell what kind of personal business he is doing behind it as he sits there twisting his senior class ring around and around his finger and listens to Tony tell Sharon that she ought to start taking care of her own baby herself . Tony is veryp62Italian , very like his mother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though there is a hornet trying to get at him from behind . His voice is rapid and rising in pitch like a sports announcer 's . She should wash the crap out of the baby 's diapers herself , he says , and get up in the night when it cries . She should be the one to give it its bottle for Christ 's sake . She should stop turning his brother into a goddamnednursemaid fairy . A mist or ragged lower edge of cloud has come driftingdown until all there is left to see of Chris 's face is the lower part , the tiny pimples around the chin , the dry lips with the little film that seals them at the corners and then breaks as he parts them slightly to moisten them . The pussy-cat tie moves with his Adam 's apple . Tony 's football-huddle arm is suddenly around his shoulder , and Chris 's neck does an odd little sideways movementlike a temple dancer 's . The rain , coming down heavier now , has for the momentwashed all expression out of Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for better or worse she and my namesake Tony are always catching each other by surprise . Her face is as perfect a blank as Eve 's must have been at the moment of her creation . Anything can happen in that face . What happens is she picks up her glass and flips the water at Tony . The water hangs unfurledin the air for a moment like a split-second photograph . It misses Tony and soaks the front of Chris 's white shirt . His flesh shows through . Tony 's chair-legs stutter noisily against the linoleum as he thrusts back hard . I bring the flat of my palm down slam on the table . We make a rain-dance beat . The wet wind has blown Sharon 's hair across one cheek . She says ,  |p63You  goddamn muscle-bound jock . " I Ie says , " The way you come swinging your cock-tease t , iil around at practice every afternoon . " She says , " If I ever dreamed I 'd have some little prick like you on my hands the rest of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invective is exclusively phallic , a ritual copulation so that in the sky the gods will also copulate and the wet come streaming down to fertilize that kitchen where I stand up to defend my wife . I say it 's a fine way to repay her for her friendship and interest . Month after month she comes , huddled in the empty bleachers at football time , standing in the cold mud for soccer , in the humid jungle haze of the swimming pool where wet boy voices echo like parrot cries from the tiled walls . I think of her leaning forward there with her chin in her hand . A banana of all things is what she is shaking at him there by the red-topped counter where a bowl of them sits , our dessert , and where the hell does he think she can find time to take care of a baby or anything else when she has to spend the whole damn day picking up after him  --  his cruddy socks and underpants and that wreck of a room where she hates to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . . . opening the door . At fear she stops and everything stops including the rain which becomes suddenly a slow , cold drizzle . We are all standing up now except for Chris , who is still sitting down at the table in silence . In the overhead light he is as white as his wet , white shirt . You can see one nipple through it . The corned beef hash has gone cold on his plate . Everything around him in the circle of light glistens from the drizzle , the rest of us shadowed . His eyes are pink . His voice comes cracked , plaintivep64through our silence which is soggy and soft as wet leaves . He says , " Who says I 'm a goddamned nursemaid fairy ? " For a moment or two we are all caught unfurled in the air like the water from Sharon 's glass . Upstairs Bill has woken up from his nap and is crying . After dark I went out to commune with my Thing , my Dangle . It looked bigger than I remembered it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a touch from my finger was enough to set it stirring on its chain . It felt : very heavy . Shadows rose and fell and crisscrossed . The air smelled woody . I sat on the workbench and watched it a while . Raw pine . The parts where I 'd sanded it were soft as skin . I noticed a part I 'd missed inside the upper arc of one of the round holes cut out through a leg plank . Through the hole , I could see a piece on the other side begin to appear as the whole thing ponderously , almost imperceptibly , turned . As it turned , the piece seemed to come down across the hole like a wooden eyelid . Nothing is as fascinating as something you 've made yourself . Just your own handwriting on an envelope , or a shelf you 've put up , even a crap you 've taken  --  they give you the feeling , if you look in a certain way , that they contain a secret and that if you could only get at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of your life . I must have sat out there a good half hour or more watching the thing before I was interrupted by Sharon . She did n't come in but called to me through the window . She had a flashlight , and in order not to shine it in my eyes , she shone it upwards so that all the shadowson her face went the wrong way and made her lookp65like somebody else . " Bip phoned , " she said . " He 's got his plans all made . I le wants us to get moving and find a house for him and Luce . He does n't care what kind of a house it is , but he wants it to have a barn or a garage that 's big enough to start preaching Holy Love in . He talked a lot about the great whore and her abominations and forni-cations . " I said , " You 've got to hand it to him . " Sharon said , " It could have been a whole lot worse . f Ie could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the way back to the house , I asked her if everything was all right with her and the boys . I had n't gone out to the shed until I 'd thought it was , nobody shaking hands and making up or anything but Sharon being the one to go upstairs to see to the baby and Tony doing the dishes single-handed while she was gone . With Novemberturning to May again , Chris and I had just wandered off like the swallows going back to Capistrano . I thought everything was probably all right , but I wanted to hear her say it . " Poor old Chris , " she said . " I felt so sorry for him I could have kissed him right there in the kitchen . " I said , " If you ever kiss one of them you better kiss the other one too . " She stopped right there in the dark . She said , " Hey Antonio . Are you kidding , Antonio ? " She did n't call people by their names very often and did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing whom she was saying it to . It was more intimate than using names . But this time she used my name twice . It was as if I had slept through the alarm and she was trying to get me to wake up.  |p66WORDS  WERE the least important part of what Lucille Bebb used when she was telling a story . She used long pauses . She used her lower jaw . She used her dark glasses and her eyebrows . But lots of clouds came dot , dot , dot out of her head with thoughts in them . Lucille 's genius was to make these clouds somehow visible to her listener . You left her with the sense that she had described in detail events which as far as her words were concerned she had barely suggested . Since Bebb had insisted that expense was no object , within a few days I was able to rent him a farmhouse about halfway between Sutton , where Sharon and I lived , and Stamford . The house belonged to a university couple who were away on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to fly up from Houston with Lucille , sign the lease , and move in all within little more than a week of his original phone call . As Bebb had specified , the house came with a barn , and it was in the barn that Lucille gave me what turned out to be the first installment of an epic . Bebb had gone off to New York to see about having a sign made for his new church , and Lucille and I had our conversation alone . In setting down what she told me , I am giving perhaps ten times more than what she actually gave me , but this does not mean that I have taken liberty with the facts or embellished them unduly . It means simply that I have included the contents of the clouds . She started off by telling me about elevators . She said there were elevators and elevators . There were the regulareveryday elevators that you got into on the fifth floor or the sixth floor , say , and could ride on down to the ground floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down to the basement . There were some places where you could ride them clear on down to the subbasementor whatever the bottom-most floor was called . But then there were also some other elevators , she told me , that you could ride farther down than that . There were elevators that went deeper than the bottom . Farther down than down . If I knew what she meant , she said , raising her eyebrows . I asked her where these elevators were supposed to take you . She paused for a while , then said , " Ask Bebb . " After a while she said there were n't too many elevators of this second kind . To your average person , they would look just like your average elevators . You had to be special yourself to know they were special , to know how to work them and where they went and why they went there . She happened to know there was one in Houston.  |p68She  was n't sure just where in Houston exactly , but she had an idea it was in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country there were maybe ten or a dozen like it , mostly in big cities . There was one in Chicago , one in L.A. , one in Seattle . There were more of them in the West than in the East for some reason . But there were supposed to be two of them in New York City . She did not say anything for a while then , and part of what she did not say was that at that very moment , as we both knew , Bebb was in New York City himself . She just said there were two of these special elevators in New York City and let it go at that , let it go but on a rather long leash and for a rather long time . During this time one of the clouds rose up out of her head puff-puff like a child 's picture of steam coming out of a steam engine . In the cloud I saw Bebb . Bebb was standing alone in an elevator . He was wearing a raincoat buttoned up to his chin and his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a very determined expression and was keeping track of the floors by watchingthe window in the elevator door . Down , down , the elevator went , and at each new floor a light flashed in through the window and lit up Bebb 's face . The elevator went down to the ground floor , the basement , the subbasement , and kept on going . Bebb 's face was light and then dark again , light and then dark again . His arms hung stiff at his sides . Lucille said , " They have their meetings down there . " I said , " Who have their meetings ? " The barn where we were standing was more or less empty . Hanging from one of the beams there was a knotted rope for climbing and from another a child'sp69swing . There was a Make Love Not War poster on one of the walls . On the floor Bebb had marked in chalk where he wanted the altar table to go and the pulpit . He had ordered them already and expected them any day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Fields in a beaver hat looking up furtively from a poker hand . I had not noticed before the resemblance to Bebb . Maybe it was just that they were both pokerfaced . Lucille said , " They come from way up , but they have their meetings way down . " It was only about eleven o'clock on a Saturday morning , but I said anyway , " You 've been hitting the Tropicanasa little earlier than usual , have n't you ? " Lucille said , " You blame me ? " She had moved and was standing in front of one of the windows . With the light coming from behind , you could see how thin her hair was . You could see the curve of her scalp through it . She said , " You remember Mr. Golden , do n't you ? " It took me a moment or two , but then I remembered . I said , " What about Mr. Golden , Luce ? " She dropped her lower jaw slightly . She said , " What about Mr. Golden yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me once that to every one Golden there 's maybe half a dozen Silvers . " I said , " Bebb talks to you about this kind of stuff ? " Lucille said , " Sometimes I ca n't worm a thing out of Bebb . Other times I ca n't hardly shut him off . " I said , " All he ever told me was he believed there were people around off of flying saucers and they were the same as what the Bible calls angels . " " That 's what he tells people , " Lucille said.  |p70On  again off again , on again off again , went the light on Bebb 's face as the elevator descended . Then the light came on to stay . The elevator had stopped and the door slid open . Bebb stepped out . There was an enormous circular room that looked like the U.N . Security Council or an operating amphitheater . It was brightly lit from the ceiling , and there were circular tiers of seats radiating out from the clear space in the middle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no sound as he walked across it . He climbed up into the seats and took an empty one about fifteen or twenty rows back . He took off his coat and hat and sat down . In the seat next to him was the man who had remained standing at Herman Redpath 's funeral when everyone else got down to pray , or else it was the man 's twin brother . He turned toward Bebb and welcomed him with the same gay and youthful smile . He had on a pair of earphones with an antenna sticking up over one ear . Bebb nodded back brusquely as he put on his own earphones . There is such a thing , I am told , as a folie a deux , a state of things where a person 's hallucination becomes so intense that he can give it to somebody else like measles and the two of them start hallucinating together . With Bebb away on his errand in New York City , Lucille had been hitting the Tropicanas earlier than usual that morning , and for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't touched a drop , was drunk as a monkey . When Bebb 's sign finally came , he asked Sharon and me and the boys to come over and see it . Like the Holy Love sign , it was a life-size cross made of opaque glass which could be lit up inside . Like the Holy Love signp71too , the two parts of the new church 's name were writtenone on the horizontal member and one on the verticalmember in such a way that they shared a common letter . OPEN was written on the cross piece , and HEART came down through it where the E was . To make the lettering symmetrical there was a red heart after the N in OPEN . Bebb switched the light on for us , and we all stood in the spring dusk admiring it . It jutted out over the barn door so that it would be visible from the road . Bebb said , " Revelations three twenty . Behold , I stand at the door and knock . If any man hear my voice and open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys , now you listen to that because it 's dynamite . Jesus is cooling his heels right there at the door of your heart , and he 's knocking . All you got to do is open up and he 'll enter in and sup with you . Talk about your open heart surgery . Why , Jesus has got all the rest of them beat a mile . Once you open your heart up to him , I tell you it stays open . It stays open day and night and welcomes all who pass by with open arms  --  the widow , the orphan , the  --  boys , it even welcomes your enemy once Jesus gets it open wide enough . " Sharon was standing by the lilac bush . Bebb came over and put his arm around her shoulder . He pointed up at the sign and said , " Honey , how do you like that for the name of your old Bip 's brand new church ? " Sharon said , " You 've done it again , Bip . " Lucille said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll all go back and have something out on the verandah . " Bebb was still looking up at his sign . He said , " Starting tomorrow , I 've got an ad that 's going to run in all thep72local papers . It says Have a Heart . ' It says , Open your heart to Jesus . Open your heart to each other . Open your heart TODAY . ' I 've got my name on it just Leo Bebb , Evangelist . Nothing about Holy Love or Gospel Faith or any of the rest of it . That 's ancient history now . Up here I 'm starting out with a clean slate . I 'm starting out fresh with nothing except Jesus . " A clean slate . A fresh start . The clothes he was booked in returned to him at the warden 's office . His bus-fare home put in his pocket . But that was all . Except maybe Jesus . I thought of Bebb starting fresh back then , years before I knew him , after he 'd finished paying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Miami . And here was Bebb starting fresh again now with Open Heart . I wanted to say , " Open your heart to us , Bip . Tell about Miami . " I wanted to tell what little I knew about it myself . I wanted to tell Tony and Chris especially because it did n't seem fair for them not to know the full richness and roundness of the man which all the rest of us standing with them under the life-size cross knew in essence if not in detail . It did n't even seem fair to Bebb for them not to know . I wanted to teach Bebb to them like school . Bebb stood next to Sharon stuffed like a sausage into his dark suit with the lilacs turning to dusk behind him and his fat face full of secrets . I wanted to freeze him there like a slide projected on a screen and give a lecture on him . With the end of a pointer I wanted to touch his tight little H of a mouth and its hinges , touch under each magician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbed cheek and where the extra flesh made his earlobes stick out . I wanted to say , " This is Leo Bebb . He is full of beans and bounce . He is afraid of nothing except heights . Ip73have seen him myself approach lions unarmed on the road between Armadillo and West Palm Beach . He is a supersalesman for Jesus . He has done time . Exactly what it is he did time for and whether or not he was framed , I 'm not sure . Only once in my presence did he refer to it directly . He said he had heard about as good singing behindbars as he 'd ever heard anywhere . " I wanted to say , or did n't want to say , " The story is there were some children playing ball behind a seafood restaurant in Miami , and Bebb opened up and showed them something . Is it possible to believe that ? Look at the way he 's got his breastpocket handkerchief folded . Look how excited he is about his new sign and how he 's put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that the children misunderstood some innocent gesture ? There is no reason why he could n't have just been taking a leak in the alley thinking he was alone and , when he heard their voices behind him , simply spun around in surprise . " I should say there is almost no reason because it 's true that at the ordination of Herman Redpath in Armadillo , a somewhat similar incident may have taken place . At a climactic moment in the service , Bebb raised his arms high above his head , and as he did so , his robe came apart up the middle , and several who were actually present at the time tell me the whole place was emptied in the space of minutes . But nobody pressed charges , and although it 's true Bebb left Armadillo under a cloud , he left of his own free will . But that first time in Miami , charges were pressed . Bebb pleaded not guilty and was convicted . He spent five years behind bars . And here he is now , halfway between Sutton and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing except Jesus and a hundredp74thousand dollars in the bank . " Bebb stopped looking at the sign . He said , " What 's your pleasure , folks ? " and went around taking our orders . I had never seen him angry before or speak a harsh word to anybody except Brownie , but after we 'd been sitting on the porch for a while having our drinks , both happened . Lucille was sitting tipped back in her rocker with her feet braced against the porch railing . It was getting dark , and for once she had taken off her black glasses and was staring vacantly out into the twilight when Tony returned with her glass which she had sent him out into the kitchen to refill . She took it out of his hand in a vague way and must have forgotten that it was full again because as she raised it to her lips to take her first deep sip , she slopped most of it down her front . The surprise made her push out with her feet against the railing , and before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocker . Her skirt was up around her waist and her bony legs sticking into the air . One arm was flung out to the side , and she was holding what was left in her glass miraculously unspilled . Her mouth was open in an odd , crooked way'as though somebody had hit her in the jaw . Bebb said , " Get up , Lucille . Get up this minute , " and his voice was a frightening thing to hear . When Tony came forward to help her , Bebb barred his way with his arm . " Pick yourself up and go inside , " he said . I did not want to watch her pick herself up , but I watched her . Sharon helped get the chair out from under her , and then Lucille rolled over to one side and took hold of the railing . With this she managed to pull herself up to her knees and finally to a standing position.  |p75Her  dress was hiked up in back and her thin hair sticking out in all directions . She brushed Sharon aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the twilit porch taking what was left of her Tropicana and enteringthe house without a word or glance at any of us . Almost as soon as she had gone , Bebb started talking about her . The anger had left his voice . There was n't much light left , and such as there was was enough to see by only if you did n't try to see too much . As Bebb spoke , his face began to swarm like a hive , became almost indistinguishable from the blue dusk that swarmed around it . He said , " First job I ever had was washing dishes in her father 's restaurant in Spartanburg . She was a couple of years younger than me , and there was plenty of them after her . I never thought I stood a Chinaman 's chance , but her father took a shine to me . It was him that helped me land a job selling Bibles . I was n't even dry behind the ears yet and never got through high school because my father was laid up in bed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work early . But I knew Scripture backwardsand frontwards  --  Mother , she 'd seen to that  --  and soon I was making enough on commission to pop the question to Lucille . Nobody was more surprised than me when she told me yes . It was hard on her having me on the road most of the time . My territory reached from Louisville clear down to Birmingham , and there was times I did n't even get home weekends . It was hard on her not having a baby right off too . She lost three while she was still carrying them before one finally was born . Little thing did n't only live but a few months . " Tony was perched on the porch railing with his chin on his knee , Chris on the porch floor leaning up against the house . They looked as lulled as I felt lulled myselfp76by the ebb and flow of Bebb 's voice coming out of the dusk . He could have told them anything , and they would have hardly noticed . He could even have told them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of what he said would have been lost in the sound . Or I could have told them myself . Bebb is off somewhere selling Bibles , and Lucille is at home with their colicky first-born . For a week now she has been taking care of him by herself , picking him up , walking him , rocking him at all hours of day and night whenever the pains in his stomach set him howling until his lips turn blue . She is no longer sure whether it is night or day . She 's not even sure which is doing the howling , the baby or she . She will be just about to doze off in her lonely bed for the ninth or tenth time maybe when the noise that is somewhere between a sewing machine and a chain-saw wakes her up , and several times she has dragged herself all the way across the room beforenoticing that she and the baby are making the noise together . On one occasion she finds a hand crawling up the side of her head like a spider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's her own hand . The baby is lying in the bathroom where she keeps the crib at night , Bebb 's boy . She picks him up under the arms , his head lolling back until she cups it in one hand and holds him tight . She can feel his mouth against her throat , one fist the size of a golfball at her breast . From the bathroom to the bedroom , from the bedroom to the bathroom , until finally he is no longer tense and squirming but heavy and loose and warm and she lowers him carefully into his crib like a loaf and turns him over on his stomach . This time she has a hunch that he is down for what 's left of the night and fixes herself ap77drink to celebrate , then another drink or possibly two , listening to some midnight dance band being broadcast from a hotel somewhere and wondering maybe where Bebb is now and what he is doing and who he is doing it with . It is the eve of the Second World War , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the eve of a good sleep and sweet dreams . She does n't bother to undress , stretches out as she is . She closes her eyes . The bed starts to turn slowly like a display in a departmentstorewindow . She lowers one arm so that her fingers touch the floor , and this stops it . Her feet fill with helium and begin to bear her up into the sky . Higher and higher they bear her , her head trailing below through clouds . She is nearing the warm gravitational field of a dream . She sees the marble counter of her father 's restaurant . Down the counter someone is sliding along to her a hot fudge sundae with whipped cream and walnuts on top . The hot fudge starts to overflow , traveling slowly down her belly like fingers , like a voice whispering sweet , dark secrets . The baby is crying in short bursts with equal bursts of silence in between so that she ca n't tell whether the pattern is white on black or black on white or which is dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she strains to take in the secret of the dark and traveling fingers . Something infinitely sweet is being pulled just out of her reach down the smooth , veined surface . Bebb 's baby is howling . Bebb is off playing with himself in some cheap hotel room full of Bibles . The dream , the secret , the sundae  --  it is gone now , the most precious thing she has ever lost although she ca n't remember justp78what it was any more as she gets up off her bed so fast and mad that for a moment she thinks she is going to faint . There is a humming in her ears that drowns out the baby , and she has to hold on to the bedpost to keep from falling down . Then she bursts into the bathroom , slamming the door back against the tub . The ugly halffacein the crib , the smell of babyshit , the sight of her own face in the mirror . She grabs up the first thing that catches her eye . It is a long-handled toilet brush . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon had gone into the house to make sandwiches for us , and had turned some lights on inside . Bebb and Chris were talking . It was one of the miracles of the space age : Bebb , so round and firm and full of bounce , from Mars , and Chris from whichever one it is that 's mainly just clouds of cosmic gas . Bebb was leaning against one of the pillars , a little of the dim , gold lamplightglinting in his eyes . Chris was cross-legged on the floor at Bebb 's feet . He had his head tilted to the side and was smoking a cigarette . He was the only smoker among us , and Sharon , who on yoga principles would otherwise have objected strenuously , said he should n't give it up . She said Chris needed to smoke as an antidote to his own personality . Chris was talking to Bebb about a job he hoped to get that summer with a repertory company that put on plays in a theater not far from us in Sutton . He would help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if things turned out as he hoped , he said , maybe they would let him have an occasional small part or walk-on . " I want to make the theater my life , " I heard him say . It was the first I could remember having heard of it , this plan for his life , but I had a feeling that he might havep79made the same speech to me before and I simply had n't been paying attention . You paid attention to Tony whether you wanted to or not . Just the bang of his footsteps on the stair or the way he left his clothes thrown around his room was vivid and memorable , but Chris was like an over-exposed photograph  --  indistinct , washed-out . " I want to make the theater my life , " he said , this phrase out of Mary Noble , Backstage Wife , but no sooner did it slip from his mouth than it faded into the air with the smoke from his cigarette . He was talking about his life and his dreams for the future like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was the Sermon on the Mount , his expression intenseand absorbed and the glow of the lamplight in his face . Right after Bill was born and they let me in to see Sharon , a nurse came and placed both her hands flat on Sharon 's lower stomach and pressed steadily down on it for a few seconds . I 'm not sure what the purpose of it was , but she did it with such a measured and professionalair that the image has stayed in my mind . I can see her still the way she leaned over the bed in her crisp white uniform and applied what you could tell was a good deal of pressure but not an ounce too much . She had her head turned away from Sharon so as not to breathe in her face , I suppose . She was looking at me . But it was n't me she was seeing . She was seeing whateverit was that she was supposed to be doing to Sharon 's insides down there under the covers . When Chris stopped talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a period at the end but his usual semi/colon or little row of dots  --  Bebb did something that brought that scene back to me uncannily . He leaned forward and put his hands down on Chris 's shoulders , and although it happened to be me that his eyes fastened on , it was n't me he was looking at . Bebb kept his hands on Chris that way until Sharon appeared in the doorway to tell us the sandwiches were ready . Sharon stood looking out at us through the screen . Tony already had his hand on the doorknob to go in , and I could see her face over his shoulder . She opened her eyes as wide as they would go and opened her mouth . Very slowly she stuck her tongue out farther and farther until she looked as if she was trying to touch the floor with it and then she stuck it out a little farther still . She held it there for a while and then slowly withdrew it . At the same time she relaxed her eyes . I recognized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be good for revitalizing the face and neck and also served to reduce tension.  |p81SOMEBODY  left a rose in a hymnal at Open Heart . It was a tight-petaled , crimson rose that looked as if it had just been picked . The hymn that it marked was " Jerusalem the Golden , " which was not one of the ones that had been sung that morning . Whoever left it , Bebb said , must have left it as a love offering , and he put it in a glass of water , eventually set it on the altar table with the other flowers and the cross . The results of Bebb 's " Have a Heart " ad were disappointing . He had set up chairs in the barn for a hundred and fifty , but not more than thirty or forty came . More than half of these were women , and more than half of the women were black . A lot of the rich people aroundp82Greenwich and New Canaan had black help , and the way Bebb figured it out , they must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them in the South and the ad had revived old memories . They were better dressed than most of the whites with their hats and straw purses and occasional white gloves , and Bebb began his service with a special word of welcome for them . He said in Christ there was no east or west and there was n't any black or white either and Jesus knocked just as hard to get you to open up your heart if it was one color as he did if it was another color . It was impossible to generalize about the whites who came . There were several young men dressed alike in black suits and black ties with their hair slicked down who Bebb said afterwards were Mormon missionaries who happened to be in the area . There was an elderly woman with hair the color of raw meat who brought some kind of small rodent-like animal in a cage with her and sat in the back row . There was an Italian couple I recognized as the proprietors of a vegetable stand we stopped at sometimes , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf cap which he did not remove during the service . A bearded man who wore short pants and the kind of leather sandals that have thongs you wrap around your ankles came in a pickup truck with a load of children in back . There were one or two couples who might have been poor relations of the people with the black help . It was not a fashionable congregation . Except for Sharon , the blacks were the only women who had on hats , and of the men present I doubt that more than a handful were wearing neckties . There had been some talk about Brownie 's flying upp83all the way from Houston to help out at the opening Sunday , but apparently he had his hands full with Holy Love and called up to say that he could n't make it . Bebb took the news in his stride , but it seemed to be a major disappointment to Lucille and may have helped account for her subsequent behavior that morning . Sharon and I were there , of course , and to my surprise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put any pressure on them . And at the last minute the boys ' father , my exbrother-in-lawCharlie Blaine , also joined us with his housekeeper , Mrs. Kling . Tony and Chris originally came to stay with us because they had already taken to spending more and more of their vacation time with us and after we had been married a year or so Charlie finally decided that since the Sutton school system was better than theirs at home , they might as well move in with us altogether . As a scriptwriter for educational TV , he did most of his work at home and was obviously just as glad to get them out of his hair . Not long before she died , my sister Miriam , who had been divorced from Charlie for several years by then , hinted to me that she hoped something like this would happen , and so I was also pleased with the move . So , I think , was Sharon . Charlie lived only a couple of hours away from us with Mrs. Kling to look after him , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to put us to any trouble by calling ahead of time and making us give something up , he said , so he and Mrs. Kling would just drop by and take their chances , which was of course more trouble still . We were on the point of leaving the house to go over to Bebb 's church when they arrived . It was a fresh spring morning , but they had all the windows of Charlie 's Buickp84shut tight and the air-conditioning on . Charlie felt that it was better for his allergies that way . Mrs. Kling was at the wheel . She was a tireless woman with big calves and a big bust who wore a lot of lipstick and always sounded as though she was trying to make herself heard through a closed door . Charlie was wearing an overcoat and a fedoraand looked as if the bright sunlight hurt his eyes as he climbed out of the car to greet his sons . He still kissed them when he had n't seen them for a while , and althoughSharon said it gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it so naturally . It has always seemed sad to me that about the only place where American males can embrace one another without incurring the darkest suspicions is on the athletic field . Charlie kissed Chris first , and it was like the meeting of apostles in a fresco , those two faded figures reaching out their arms toward each other in such a Giottoesque and dreamlike way . When it came Tony 's turn , Tony gave him a bear hug that almost lifted him off his feet . Mrs. Kling stood nearby presiding over the reunion as though it was some new therapy that she had arranged for Charlie 's gallbladdercondition , and when I explained to them that we were on our way to Bebb 's inaugural service , she said that a little religion never hurt anybody and they would go right along with us . So the six of us ended up sitting with Lucille that first morning at Open Heart . Chris brought his tape recorder along and recorded Bebb 's sermon with it . Bebb took off from a phrase from Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles . He said , " You take a little child that 's been  --  let 's say he 's being punished for something he never even did . They shove him into the closet andp85turn the lock on him . It 's black as pitch in the closet , and there 's none too much air to breathe . He stumbles around through the shoes and mothballs . Soft , hanging things strike him in the face , and he thinks there 's creatures of darkness in there with him with buttons where their eyes ought to be and no arms inside their sleeves . He hammers his pitiful little fists on the door and begs and hollers for somebody to come let him out . But nobody comes . There 's nobody even answers him . " You take an animal in a cage . You take a royal Bengal tiger which is  --  why , Solomon in all his glory was not arrayedlike a royal Bengal tiger in his black and gold suit . Up and down the cage he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back and forth , year in and year out . Every time he comes to the end of his cage going one way , he shifts his head around so it 'll still be facing out at the bars when he goes back the other way . He 's a king , and he wants to look out where the freedom is . People come and throw peanuts at him . " You take a man in jail . Jails are n't like they used to be  --  full of rats and bugs with everybody chained up and nothing except bread and water for dinner . Jails are worse now . They 're spic and span now , and they smell of creosote . Every week you get your clothes laundered in jail , and they give you soft slippers to put on your feet . The food 's not half bad . If you keep your nose clean , you get to watch TV and go to bed most any time you want . " But brothers and sisters in Jesus , it 's jail . It 's jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like home . For lots of folks it 's better than any home they ever knew . It 's like home except for only just one thing . It 's like that child in the closet . It 's like the tiger in the cage . You ca n't get out.  | " Through the windows you see somebody 's wife hangingup the wash in the sun . Only you ca n't get out . From the vegetable garden out back , you can look across the highway to where the Howard Johnson 's is . Easiest thing in the world just to drop in and have yourself a cone or some French-fries . Only you ca n't get out . You can see the folks out driving places with their kids come walking through the swinging door with ice cream cones in their hands . Only you ca n't get out . " Fellow sinners , you can take a look at the birds in the sky . You can watch the clouds change shape . You can watch the faces of the guards and think how when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain with the wipers going and maybe stop off on the way and pick up something special for dessert . You can tell how when they get home and open the door , they 'll smell a smell is n't like any other smell in the world . It 's the smell of their wife and kids . It 's the smell of their dinner cooking . It 's the smell of their own life . Only you ca n't get out . No , sir . Jail 's what you ca n't get out of . Not for five years , ten years , twenty . Maybe you 're never going to get out . " Bebb said , " Right here in Scripture , Saint Paul , he says , I am a prisoner for Jesus Christ . ' I am in the dark closet . I am in the cage at the zoo . I am in jail . For Jesus ' sake . I did n't have to be here . I chose to be here . I 'm here for doing like Jesus said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm here for showing my love to the brethren . I 'm here for opening my heart . That 's what Saint Paul says . " What did Saint Paul do while he was in prison ? Friends , I 'm going to tell you what he did . Among his fellow prisoners there was mostly every kind of sinnerp87you 'd care to think of . There was murderers and thieves . There were child-beaters and rapists and sodomites . Beforehe was through , he had led many of them to accept Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior . He had got them singing the songs of Zion . Many 's the cell he washed down with the Blood of the Lamb before they finally let him out . " With their profiles overlapping , Charlie Blaine and Mrs. Kling looked like monarch and consort on a coronationmedal only it was Mrs. Kling who was the monarch  --  some early world-conqueror with her heavy red lips and eyebrows penciled in thick and black  --  and Charlie the shadowy presence at her side . I remember the curve of Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , floppy brim . I remember Tony beside her , his upperlip moist and the muscles of his jaw appearing and disappearing like the spokes of a wheel . And it was at about this point that I first noticed Lucille acting strangely . She kept crossing and uncrossing her legs and rearranging her filmy skirt over her knee . She would open her mouth and put her hand over it as if to conceal a yawn or a belch . The barn was big and dim , and the only light was the small reading light on Bebb 's lectern . The pulpit did n't look big enough for him . He rose up out of it like a jack-in-the-box . He said , " There 's more than one way to skin a cat . To be a prisoner for Christ means more than just being a prisoner inside Comstock or Leavenworth or Soledad . Maybe Jesus calls some of us to be that type prisoner just like he called Saint Paul to . But there 's another way he calls every last one of us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a prisoner right inside our own skin . Why every last one of you sitting there listening to mep88knows exactly what I mean . There 's a royal Bengal tiger in every single son of Adam and daughter of Eve and except you keep the cage door clapped tight on him , he 's going to get out and tear things to pieces . Tear himself to pieces too , likely as not . " The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak ' the Good Book says . That 's another way of saying the flesh is strong . Brothers and sisters , the flesh is a mighty beast , and we 've got to post guards day and night and put up electric alarm systems to make sure he do n't get loose . We got to keep the beast locked up so we can feed Jesus ' lambs for him and not feed on Jesus ' sweet and tender lambs . " Only listen to this now . We do n't have to keep him in the lock-up forever . No , sir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming when the locked up part of us is going to get washed in the saving blood of Jesus same as all the other parts . Amen . The day is comingwhen the royal Bengal tiger in us will lie down with the lamb in us , and the lion shall eat straw like the ox , and they shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain , saith the Lord . " Several amens were called out . I noticed the black faces especially . Many of them were smiling and nodding to themselves as if Bebb was showing them pictures of places they recognized from a long time back . Dressed up in their gloves and spring hats like their mistresses , they nodded yes , yes , that was how it used to be . The blind man sat with his white cane hooked around the back of his neck and his mouth ajar . Bebb blossomed out over the constricting sides of the pulpit like a great maroon rose . One stubby white hand thumped a counterpointto his words.  |p89He  said , " Folks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus was a prisoner in a prison though the Jews , they booked him there for a few days at the end . But I do n't mean that kind of prisoner . And I do n't mean Jesus was a prisoner inside his own skin like you and I , because Jesus was Rose of Sharon , brothers , he was Lily of the Valley . He was the royal Bengal tiger and the lamb withoutblemish both . There was no sin in him , nothing he had to jail up inside . He had the seat of honor in Heaven , and it was through him the earth was made . Only then he come down . He come down from Heaven . From Heaven ! You ever stop to think what that means ? You ever stop to think what it means to come down out of I Ieaven into this two-bit world ? " Up there in Heaven Scripture says the streets are of pure gold like unto clear glass and the twelve gates are twelve pearls and there is no Temple where people go to worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the place and day and night the angels sing praises at his throne . That 's the place Jesus left to come here . " He come down out of the heavenly place to this place . Down , down he come , and what did he find when he got here ? He found a place where there 's not enough food to stretch round . He found a place where every single night there 's little children go to bed crying because that day it was n't their turn to eat . He found a place where people are scared stiff of each other most of the time and hide from each other and sometimes come out of their hiding places to do hateful things to each other . " You take your nine-year-old girl found beat-up and raped in the park . You take your old woman shipped offp90to some cheap-jack nursing home to die of lonesomeness . Jesus found a place where even nature 's gone bad . Where babies are born with little shriveled-up arms and young men with their whole life ahead of them get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaches are piled up along the road going rotten to keep the price up when there 's people do n't have the price of a peach . " Friends , Jesus come down to a place where every last man , woman and child is living on death row . You 'd think the least thing we could do was draw close and comfort each other , but no . Except for a few loved ones , we close the doors of our hearts and bolt them tight on each other . " Bebb 's voice grew quieter toward the end . He held on to the sides of his new pulpit with his shoulders hunched up . He said , " This world Jesus come down to , it 's got good things in it too , praise God . It 's got love in it and kindness in it and people doing brave and honest things , not just hateful things . It 's got beauty in it . It 's got the silver light of the moon by night and the golden beams of the sun by day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof and the smell of the rain on the fresh-turned earth . It 's got human forms and faces that are so beautiful they break your heart for yearning after them . But coming down from where he come down from , all the good things of the world must have just made Jesus homesick for the place he come down from . Brothers and sisters , the whole planet was a prison for Jesus . He got born here like the rest of us and did the work here he come to do , and he died here . But it was never like it was home to him . " Same as creatures from some other part of the universe , Jesus was a stranger in this place , and that 's an/other meaning to Saint Paul 's words when he says , I am a prisoner for Christ . ' Saint Paul means this whole planet 's my prison because I do n't belong to this planet . I 'm down here just for your sake same as Jesus was . That 's all . I belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get homesick for it something wicked . " Lucille was on her feet beside me . She had her hand up to her mouth as if she was going to be sick . She was wearing a gauzy dress with lots of pleats and folds that hung low on her skinny legs . She reminded me of photographsI 've seen of Aimee Semple MacPherson at the Angelus Temple . She wobbled back and forth on her spike heels for a minute and then like some kind of extinctbutterfly started weaving her way back up the aisle toward the door . Bebb could see what was happening , but he remained as cool as he had in the presence of the Joking Cousin at Herman Redpath 's funeral . Nothing in his voice or mannerchanged as she opened the barn door noisily and went rattling out into the spring . I went after her as quietly as I could up the creaking aisle and many heads turned to watch me go , but such was the power of Bebb 's oratory that by the time I reached the door , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black prisoners ' faces looking up at Bebb from underneath their fancy , white-lady hats . Lucille 's heart . She did not open her heart to me when I caught her hurrying home across the lawn . She gave it to me instead and told me to open it for myself later . She pulled it out from somewhere inside the gauzy flaps and pennants and put it into my hand . It was a numberp92of sheets of flowered stationery written on both sides right through the flowers and rolled up into a tube with a couple of rubber bands doubled up around it . The sun was so bright that you could see her scalp through her thin hair like the curve of a wooded hillside when the leaves have fallen . She said , " Take it . Do n't read it now . You 'll know when to read it . " I said , " Are you sick ? Is there anything I can do for you ? " She said , " Sometimes when he gets going like that , it scares the bejeezus out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to be scared about ? " Her dress was floating all over the place in the breeze . She had to brush away a bit of the wide collar that had fluttered across her mouth . She said , " I 'm scared he 'll get telling too much . " I said , " About what ? " She said , " You name it . " She turned and managed to get up the porch steps in her high heels . At the top she paused , all her plumes stirring . She said , " I got to take something to steady my nerves . You go on back . " I offered to stay with her , but she would n't let me . She said , " Keep it in a safe place and forget I ever gave it to you . " At the screen door she paused again as if to say something else , but then she entered the house without a word . I returned to the barn for what was left of the service as she had told me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the house to wait until Bebb had finishedshaking hands with the last members of his congregationso we could say goodbye to him and tell him how well we thought everything had gone . Mrs. Klingp93said she had been an R.N. before she married Mr. Kling and insisted on being taken into the house to have a look it Lucille . God knows why , but we all went with her right into Lucille 's bedroom . Mrs. Kling said , " It looks to me like you 've picked yourself up some type of virus that 's going the rounds . Your color 's lousy . The last thing you should be tanking up on is all that orange juice . ' there 's enough acid in that size glass to burn your radiatorright out . " Lucille paid no attention to her or to Charlie either . I do n't think she had the faintest idea who they were . She just lay stretched out on her bed with her shoes off and her dark glasses off and her eyes looking little and dried up . She reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony . Poor Chris , he stood there trying to look as though the hand she was holding belonged to somebody else . Lucille said , " Tony , I was just as good-looking as her once , " indicating Sharon . " I weighed ninety-nine pounds , and I had sweet breath , and I could play The Ranks of the Wabash right through without looking at the notes . I was a virgin up to the day I married Bebb , and that 's more than I can say for some people . Sharon , that 's some dress you 're wearing , baby . If I was to tell everything I know , there 's some of you 'd say I was smashed . It 's no wonder I got to take something to settle my nerves every chance . You hear him say open your heart ? If I opened my heart , you 'd tell me Lucille , shut it up again . Bebb , if he was to open his heart , you 'd think you was dreaming . Ask him what floor he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . Sharon baby , you 're the only apple of your daddy 's eye that your daddy 's got , baby . "  |p94She  went rambling on for what seemed an endless time . Mrs. Kling tried to take her stockings off but got only one of them peeled halfway down when Lucille kicked out with her other foot and knocked Mrs. Kling 's glasses off . If there was one thing in the world poor CharlieBlaine could n't stand , it was a scene , but he stood through this one as if he was paralyzed . He had his fedorain one hand and the Vicks inhaler that helped him breathe through his allergies in the other , and a lot of the time I think he kept his eyes closed . Lucille kept holding on to Chris so he could n't get away , but Tony and Sharon escaped into the living room where one of them must have switched the TV on to some Catholic program because Lucille 's blurred syllables kept coming through all mixed up with fragments of the Latin mass . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were all milling around the porch in our Sunday clothes like relatives after a funeral . Bebb came bounding up the stairs with his maroon robe over his arm and showed us the rose that someone had left in the hymnal . He handed it to Tony , who smelled it and gave it to his father . Charlie took the stem between his thumb and forefinger and made it turn slowly around . Who could have left it ? Why ? The rose gave us somethingother than Lucille or the service to talk about for a few minutes . Then Mrs. Kling took it from Charlie and , after inhaling its perfume so vigorously that there seemed some danger of its disappearing up one of her nostrils , returned it to Bebb . We found ourselves suddenly immobilizedby a silence as large and sprawling as a collapsedtent . There was an unmistakable feeling of Sunday in the air . You could hear one of the departing members of thep95congregation racing his motor somewhere beyond the barn . A peabody bird sang his sad , unfinished song  --  Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke in finally with a few cheerful remarks about the way things had gone at Open Heart . He was pleased that so many had come and that there were blacks and whites both . He expected more next time . The ads would keep right on appearing . The blind man had told him on the way out that he was a cousin of I tarry Truman 's . As we left , I caught sight of him through the bedroom window . Lucille was lying flat on her back asleep among all those yards of Aimee Semple MacPherson gauze . Bebb was sitting on the foot of her bed . He had one of her bare feet in his lap . I could not see either of their faces.  |p96BOTH  MY PARENTS were dead by the time my twin sister and I were twelve , and yet even so it always surprises me how few and faded my memories of them are . I have no memory of how one thing we did with them led to anotherthing , no sense of the time in between times  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of miles and miles of home movies the only thing left was a handful of disconnectedscraps that had been edited out and preserved by accident . I remember waking up in a room full of green light that came through leaves growing over the window . I remember hearing my father 's voice in the hall , and knowing it was my birthday . But of the birthdayitself I remember nothing . I remember the door ofp97our New York apartment opening and the bitter , wintry smell of my mother 's furs . I remember the chill of her check against mine . One of the fullest memories I have comes from when I must have been around nine or ten and was coming home on the school bus . We were just pulling out of the 91st Street cut through Central Park when across Fifth Avenue I caught sight of my mother and Miriam . They were standing at the curb , and I made the bus driver let me out so I could run across to meet them . We took a taxi straight down Fifth Avenue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went and had lunch together at I , ongchamps . I remember my father ordered rare roast beef for me because he said it was good for a growing boy . I remember the stiff breeze and the blue sky and the way the golden statue of General Sherman glittered in the sun with the pigeons fluttering around . I remember the promise of summer vacation in the air and F.A.O . Schwarz just across the way at 58th Street . It is one of the best memories I have because it was such an unexpectedthing to have happen , and I thought of it on the spring day , not long after Bebb 's debut at Open Heart , when I unexpectedly picked Sharon up at her guitar lesson and we wasted the whole afternoon together . I had n't planned to pick her up  --  she called and left word at the Principal 's office  --  and with a pile of papersto correct I certainly had no intention of wasting an afternoon with anybody . The happiest times are always , I suppose , by accident . And maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than usual . It was the third act that was up for grabs that day  --  Lear on the heath with Kent and the Fool , the storm coming up  --  and nothing could have seemed more remote from ourp98condition , yet there was a moment or two when for some reason it worked , came alive almost , no thanks to me . There they all sat drowsy and full of lunch . There was a gym class going on outside . You could hear somebody calling out calisthenics , one and two , and one and two . There was a bumblebee softly bumping his way back and forth across the ceiling , but nobody was paying much attention to him . I sat on the window sill in my shirtsleevesasking some boring questions somebody had written in the margin of my copy and wondering idly who had written them there and when and not caring much whether anyone tried to answer them or not . " What evidencedo you find in Act Three for a significant change in Lear 's character ? " was one of the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urquhart surprised me by answering it . He was sitting all bent over with his head in his arms on the desk , and I 'd thought he was asleep . His voice came out muffled by his arm . He said , " He 's gotten kinder . " I said , " What makes you think so ? " The second question coming so quick on the heels of the one he 'd just answered was more than William Urquharthad bargained for , and he shifted his head to the other arm without saying anything . You could see where his cheek had gotten all moist and red where he 'd been lying on it and there was the imprint of wrinkles from his sleeve . The ball was picked up by a boy named Greg Dixon . He was the pimpliest member of the class and the least popular . He said , " Well when it starts to rain , he thinks about the Fool keeping dry too . He says it right here someplace . Come on , my boy . How dost , my boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool and knave , I have one part in myp99heart that 's sorry yet for thee . ' He 's getting kinder to people like Urquhart said . " " Also , he says a prayer for people . " It was Laura Fleischman who had spoken up this time . She always sat iu the back row next to a good-looking basketball player named Carl West , who , in Tony 's gallant phrase , was getting into her pants regularly . Usually she did n't speak at all or spoke with a kind of startled breathiness as if she was surprised herself that anything beside Carl could get a rise out of her . Somebody horse-laughed not so much at what she 'd said , I thought , as at the fact that it was she who 'd said it . Carl West sat there beside her with his stocking feet stretched out as far as they would go and his head lolling back as if to watch the bee on the ceiling . " Nobody says a prayer in my book , " Greg Dixon said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's no prayer , " Greg Dixon said . " That 's not like any prayer I ever heard of . " I said , " Go ahead and read it out loud , will you , Laura ? " Carl West sat humped way over sideways now as far from Laura Fleischman as he could get . He was staring down at his writing arm , tracing some scar on it over and over again with one finger . In a small , half apologetic voice with the calisthenic count going on in the background , she read , " Poor naked wretches , wheresoe'er you are , That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm , How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides , Your looped and windowed raggedness , defend you From seasons such as these ? "  |p100Every  person has one particular time in his life when he is more beautiful than he is ever going to be again . For some it is at seven , for others at seventeen or seventy , and as Laura Fleischman read out loud from Shakespeare , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her long hair dividing over her bare shoulders , her lashes dark against her cheeks as she looked down at the page , she could go nowhere from this moment except away from it . She still had a long way to go before she left it behind for good , but I felt like Father Hopkins anyway as I watched her  --  How to keep back beauty , keep it , beauty , beauty , beauty , from vanishing away . . . " Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel , ' " she read , " That thou may'st shake the superflux to them , And show the heavens more just , ' " and two , and one and two , the voice floated in through the open windows . Carl West had one hand up to his eyes as if to shield them from the sun , the other cupped at his crotch . The bee drifted heavily down from the ceiling and hit the blackboard with a little thud , then crawled drunkenly along the chalk tray . I said , " Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right that he 's praying ? " Greg Dixon said , " We are . " He said it to be funny  --  they were the poor wretches , presumably , to have to sit there and listen to Laura Fleischman read blank verse when they could be off somewhere having whatever Greg Dixon thought of as fun  --  but nobody laughed . Maybe I just ascribed my own thoughts to them , but it seemed to me that for a moment or two in that sleepy classroom they all felt some unintended truth in Greg Dixon 's words.  |p101Laura  Fleischman in the fullness of her time . William Urquhart in his fatness . Greg Dixon with his pimples . Car1 West handsome and bored with the knowledge that Ile could get into anybody 's pants in that room that he felt like getting into . They were the poor naked wretches ; Ind at least for a moment they knew they were . The pitilessstorm . The Lear class worked , in other words . Only for a minute or two , to be sure , with no credit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only for me , and it was part of what I jogged out to the parking lot with , Sharon 's message to meet her at Anita 's in my pocket . The weather . The kids . The time of year . My poor dead sister and mother just happening to be waiting there at the curb when my bus came nosing out of Central Park . I found Anita and Sharon out in Anita 's backyard . Sharon was sitting on a canvas camp stool with Anita , gray and intense in her neat slacks and frilled shirt , leaning over her shoulder from behind . She had her hand on Sharon 's hand showing her where her fingers should go . They both looked up as I appeared around the corner of the house , but Anita kept right on with the lesson . " Do n't mind about him , " she said . " That finger belongs on the fourth fret . " That rapid , insistent little voice , that intelligent , prematurely wrinkled marmoset 's face . Sharon winked at me . Anita said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand down to help arrange Sharon 's fingers in the right position , her head , close-cropped and bullet-shaped like a boy 's , touching Sharon 's . If the two of them had beenp102alone , Anita would never have risked it  --  the touch of Sharon 's hair against her puckered cheek , taking Sharon'sfingers in hers that way and moving them around . Anita gave me her handsomest smile with wrinkles shootingout like tears from the corners of her eyes . She said , " If I 'd just gotten my hands on her a few years earlier , we could have really gone places . " Sharon stood up a good head taller , holding the guitar by the neck in one hand and letting the other hand come to rest for a moment on Anita 's crew cut . " So long , Shorty , " Sharon said . In the car she said , " Sometimes I wonder what it would really be like . " I said , " What what would really be like ? " She said , " Letting Anita make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and it might n't be so bad either . Like a Swedish massage . Antonio , " she said , letting her arm flop out the window as we took off down the Post Road . " Let 's get the hell out of here for a while . Let 's go spend a lot of money someplace . " I was still on a high from the Lear class and the smell of summer vacation in the air ; so when Sharon sat there with her arm out the window and made her suggestion , I fell like a ton of bricks . We got the hell out of Sutton and drove on to Greenwich because that was the directionwe happened to be heading and spent money all over the place . In the cheese shop we bought a wheel of brie , a Danish gjetost the color of Fels Naptha , a pound of Stilton and two loaves of black pumpernickel . At Meade 's , I lost my head in the stationery department  --  big pads and little pads , a half dozen different colored felt-tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sharon came out with a bag full of paper/backs including The Yoga Way to Figure and Facial Beauty , You Are All Sanpaku by Sakurazawa Nyoiti , a book about macrobiotic diets , a manual on vocabulary building , and Sex and the Single Girl . In a psychedelic place with huge paper flowers and inflated plastic liquor bottles in the window , we passed up the posters after a long inspection and settled instead on a transparent cylinder full of an oily blue liquid that curled and foamed like waves when you tilted it back and forth and reminded Sharon of the ocean near Armadillo . ' We wandered up and down the aisles of one of the biggest ten-cent stores I had ever seen and for a while we no more thought of buying anything than in the Louvre we would have thought of buying anything . We just touched things . We touched things made of rubber to look like centipedes and lizards and human eyes . We touched love beads and Tampax boxes , transistor radios , slippery pink piles of ladies ' underwear , bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans , checker sets , bicyclelights and electric fans . We watched a clerk with a strawberry fall net a fantail goldfish , put him in a transparentsack with some water in the bottom and then blow it up with her breath and seal it off at the top like a balloon . Sharon said that Bebb 's birthday was coming up soon and bought him a framed picture of Jesus like one that he used to have over the offering box at the first Holy Love . For Chris she bought a green eyeshade , like the kind poker players wear in movies , to use when he did his homework outside . For Tony she got a button the size of a butter plate that said Kiss a Toad Tonight . I wanted to find something for the baby , but she said there was n't anything there a baby could n't put in his mouth and choke on . We ended up at a dress shop that smelled like the in/side of a purse . It had thick wall-to-wall carpeting and salesgirls fresh out of Bennington and Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insides of shells . Sharon tried on at least two of everything . She tried on a long white evening dress with lozenge-shaped holes cut out around the midriff that you could see her suntanthrough . She tried on a leather skirt and a dress made out of woven ribbons . She tried on a tweed coat that made her look very Round Hill and a suede coat that came to her ankles with some kind of kinky white fur at the collars and cuffs that made her look like a Russian whore . She sampled so many kinds of perfume that she finally ran out of parts of herself to sample them on and dabbed some on me . In the end , she bought herself a rain hat of shiny yellow plastic with ear flaps and a string to tie them under the chin . It was almost like sex while it lasted . Without a thought in our heads , we were all fingers and eyes and heavy breathing , and when it was over , we drove down to the park where the roses and the duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spent languor watching the ducks . We even dozed off for a few minutes , and I thought how it was too bad that sleeping together has come to mean making love together when it can also mean what it says , just making peace together . When we woke up , we found that the duck pond was full of pink clouds and the sun was starting to go down . I made Sharon drive home and sat beside her with my knees propped against the dashboard and my head pillowed against one of our softer packages . We hardly said a word all the way back . I have a feeling it 's the in-between times , the times that narratives like this leave out and that the memoryp105in general loses track of , which are the times when souls are saved or lost . When we got back we found Chris in the living room . lie had Chopin on the stereo and was sitting on the couch reading . He 'd spread a baby blanket out on the floor , and Bill was lying on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window the sun was setting . The habysitter had had to go home for supper , he said , and ' Pony had left about the same time saying that a bunch of them were going off to a beach somewhere and not to wait supper for him . The sunset , the Chopin , Bill  --  it was a comforting scene to come back to after our Greenwichdebauch , and Chris presided over it with such gravity that I felt callow and irresponsible in his presence . I wished Sharon had chosen another time to show him our purchases although he seemed pleased with the green eyeshade . He had taken some hamburger out of the freezer to thaw in case Sharon had n't planned anything for supper . She had n't . After we 'd eaten , I started correcting the papers that I should have gotten to that afternoon , but by the time I was about a third of the way through I was so drowsy and so irritated at being kept up by them that I found myself filling the margins with angry red exclamation points and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better go to bed even if it meant not having their papersto hand back to them the next day as I 'd promised . It must have been around ten by then , and Tony had n't come home yet . Sharon asked if he 'd done his homework before he left , and Chris said he 'd spent most of the afternoon outside in the sun reading Playboy . Sharonp106said , " He 's some playboy all right , " and I left them shakingtheir heads at each other in the living room and went upstairs to get undressed . Hours later I woke up to a sound that in my dream had been caused by Anita Steen . I had been sitting in her studio where I was supposed to be taking some kind of lesson , but I had come unprepared and was n't even sure what it was that she was supposed to be teaching me . I told her that I had forgotten to bring my instrument , hoping that her response might give some clue as to what the instrument was , but she just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Without looking away , she reached behind her and from the shelves where she kept her collection of primitive noisemakerstook down an African tom-torn which she clamped between her knees and started thumping with her flattened palms . Louder and louder she thumped as though it was some secret message that she was trying to drum into me literally . The whole building began to vibrate with it . When I woke up , I discovered that Sharon was not in bed beside me . The bedroom door was ajar , and there was a light on in the hall . I found Sharon standing underneath the hall light in her nightdress . The thumping was still going on , and when I first stuck my head out of the room , she motionedme to be quiet as though , in some odd carry-over from my dream , she too was trying to decode a message and did n't want to miss a beat . The noise stopped for a few moments , and she said , " Guess what that 's all about , " and when whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It 's that half-assed nephew ofp107yours , that 's what it 's all about . " She said it as though I was the one she was mad at . When the thumping started again , she raised her voice to be heard over it . SIle said , " It 's half past three if you want to know . " Her face looked dark and dangerous . She said , " If he thinks anybody 's going to let him in at this hour , he 's nuts . Let him spend the night out there . It 'll do him good . " A voice said , " You better let him in , Sharon . It 's gottena lot colder out , and he could catch pneumonia . All lie 's got on is his bathing suit . " It was the first time I 'd noticed Chris . He was standinghalfway down the stairs looking up at Sharon through the railing . He had some kind of white ointment smeared around his nose and chin . I could n't make out whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sharon said , " I do n't care if he freezes his balls off . Who does he think he is , tomcatting around till three a.m. and then expecting us to snap shit when he comes home ? " Chris said , " You better let him in , Sharon . He 's got school tomorrow . " He made no move to go either up or down but just stayed where he was , looking up through the banister and waiting for reason to prevail . The baby had started to cry . I went to the window and looked down . I could see my nephew Tony standing there on the front step . He was barefoot and had nothing on except his bathing trunks and an unbuttoned shirt hanging down outside . His dark hair was plastered across his forehead , and in the moonlighthis flesh looked silver . He stopped pounding again and leaned forward with his right arm flattened out against the house and his face buried in the crook of it . For the first time since I 'd gotten up , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill crying . Then Tony looked up at the window and saw me . He said , " For Christ sake , Tono . Open up , will you ? " Even in the semi-dark with all that hair in his face I could tell he was close to tears . I turned and said to Sharon , " I 'm going down to let him in , " and started down the steps toward Chris . What I see in my mind as I look back on it is something that I could n't possibly have seen in reality . I see Tony standing down there on the front step in his bathingtrunks with his shirttail out . He is bare-legged and barefoot with the cleft down his chest a dark seam . His face is tipped up to me in the moonlight , the face of my sister 's younger boy , who was named after me . At the same time , as though I could somehow have seen them both at once , I see Sharon standing up there in the hall in her nightdress . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb shines in her hair and on her bare shoulders , but her face is in shadow because it is tipped down to watch me descend past Chris . Tony is outside looking up , Sharon is inside looking down , and yet I see them simultaneously as though for a moment the walls had turned to glass . Chris flattened himself against the wall to let me by , and Sharon said we could all go to hell . She went back into her bedroom and slammed the door . I do n't know what happened to Chris . I suppose he went up and quieted the baby . I unlocked the door and let Tony in . He was shivering with cold and exhausted , but I made him come into the living room and sit down . We sat side by side on the couch , and I told him that it did n't make any sense to stay out half the night when he had school the next day and was supposed to be getting inp109shape for track . I told him that he had n't let anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was goingwith . He could have been drowned for all we knew . I Ie had woken up the whole house . I made the speech because I thought I ought to and because I was sure Sharon was upstairs expecting me to , but my heart was n't in it . I could n't help thinking that Chris could have said substantially the same things to Sharon and me when we came back that afternoon . And I was as eager to get to bed as he was . All the time I was speaking , he sat looking straight ahead of him , his shoulders hunched , his skin all gooseflesh , his lower jaw shaking . When I had finished , he said , " Honest to God , Tono , she 's got it in for me . Anything I do , she 's on my back for it . I was out there half an hour begging her to let me in , and she would n't do it just for spite . She 'd have let me stay out there all night and freeze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " She 'd have let you in . You just have got to  --  " but he was n't listening . He had his eyes fixed glassily on the rug in front of him , and he could n't stop talking any more than he could stop his jaw from shaking . He said , " I know I 'm not perfect , but she 's not so perfect either . She comes busting into my room just to see if there 's anything she can chew me out for without even knocking . I 've seen the way she leaves her own room , her clothes flung all over the place . And Jesus , she can be gross , Tono . I mean I 've heard her say things that were so gross I would n't even say them myself and right in front of guys who hardly know her even . And some of the things she does like coming out to track in that yoga suit . I mean I do n't see what she 's  --  " but by this time I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasp110listening the way I had listened to Anita thumping her tons-tom in my dream . It was the secret message I was listening for behind the thumping , and what surprises me is not that I had already by this time started to hear it but that it had taken me so long . He was n't telling me anything I had n't heard a times before , but at the same time he was trying to get ready to tell me something else , and even though I did n't know what it was yet , I knew how it must feel to be trying to tell it or not tell it and how it was going to feel to hear it if he ever managed to get it out . He was going on about how Chris ought n't to have to be the one to take care of Bill , all that , and how hamburgers for supper week after week got to be monotonous , and although I still did n't know what he was leading up to , I already knew in some queer way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself responding to it before I knew what it was I was responding to . I reached out my arm and put it around his shoulder . He turned and buried his face against my chest . He was weeping . I was patting his shaggy , sea-smelling head like a child or a dog . Of all the words he went on to speak then , the only ones I can remember verbatim were , " I 'm sorry , Tono . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . " He must have said them a hundred times . I suppose that I had known all along that he and Sharon were lovers . I had dreamed it and forgotten the dream . It was what Sharon and I had not talked about as we had driven home through the dusk from Greenwichwith all the things we 'd bought done up in parcels in the back seat . It was itself the done-up parcel that I 'd tucked under my head to watch the pink clouds from . I had even planned to talk to my Lear class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wren goes to it , " I would have read , " and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight , " and Laura Fleischman sitting in the back row next to Carl West would have no more realized what I was talking about than I would have realized it or would have realized just as much . " Let copulation thrive , " I would have tossed out into that bee-buzzing room and would have tried to rouse them with it to some feeling for the terrible irony of the old man 's fulminations . I would have talked about irony , about inner meaning and outer meaning . Several days later when we actually did come to Act Four , it was Lear 's saying , " Give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , to sweeten my imagination " that I dwelt upon , but by then I knew why . There was nothing by then that I had n't imagined . What Tony himself had told me was little enough , his words coming out half smothered against my chest , the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his giving them , with the salt smell of his hair , the chill , hard thrust of his shoulder against me . But what little he told me turned out to be more than enough , and the scene I constructed out of it was no less rich and full than it would have been if I 'd actually been there to witness it . It had been one afternoon that March apparently , the first warm day we 'd had by then with some patches of snow still lying around in the shade like dirty laundry and the track team still doing most of its practicing inside , but there was a suspicion at least of spring in the air . Bill was out in his carriage with a babysitter . Chris and I had both stayed on after school  --  Chris was helpingdismantle the Julius Caesar sets , and I had somep112scheduling changes to work out . Tony had come back to the house alone . He had n't wanted to stand in line for a shower at the gym so he waited till he got home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Chris shared . He had n't bothered to shave that morning , so when he finished the shower he thought he might as well do that too , but he could n't find his razor so he decided to borrow mine . To get to our bathroom he had to go through our bedroom , but it was n't until the returntrip that he saw that Sharon was lying asleep on our bed . Or not asleep . What happened then was that they had simply taken each other by surprise again as for years they had been taking each other by surprise ever since he had been a short , fat twelve year old whose zipper was always coming unzipped at the top . They became lovers by accident rather than by design in this version . They were undesigning , accidental lovers . " Tono , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . " The queer feeling as I patted his head with my hand because I could n't think of anything else to do . How nobody else 's hair ever feels quite like hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but soft underneath , springy , matted like a dog 's coat . It had happened in March . They had been alone in the house . They had n't planned to be alone . Neither had known the other was there . Like comedians in a silent film , they had moved about the house always just missingeach other . When he went up , she went down . When he entered by one door , she left by another . When she lay down to sleep , he stepped into the shower and turned the water on . It was n't he who came into her room . He was in his own room by himself lying on top of his bed after hisp113shower . He was lying on his back with his knees drawn up . His eyes were closed and his head tipped back on the pillow . Awakened from her nap by sounds she possiblycould n't place , she tiptoed barefoot across the hall and pushed the door open on him . He opened his eyes . She came in . Give me an ounce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would happen as without knowing it I also had known . He as if for a shower , she as if for a nap , they had undressed in differentrooms gravely and vaguely , letting the clothes lie on the floor wherever they happened to fall . In robes of air , they had approached each other slowly then , like royalty . It was no longer a house they knew , a time and place they had dreamed about and planned . It was a coronation . All this I imagined later . With my lips touching his salt-stiff hair , I mumbled into his scalp , " That 's all right . That 's all right . Things happen , that 's all . " There in the living room at half past three a.m . I had all I could do just trying , absurdly , to comfort him.  |p114THE  NEXT DAY was a Saturday , and by midmorning I found myself on a train heading for New York . Bebb was with me . We had , caught the express from Stamford . All the seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost full itself by then . Bebb perched sidesaddle on the arm of a seat which was occupied by a little girl with leg braces , and I stood next to him . When the child told Bebb that it was all right for him to sit on the arm of her seat , he gave her one of his cards . It had a head-and-shoulders photograph of him looking straight at you with his eyes bugged out and his eyebrows raised as though he had just made a challenging pronouncementor , as Sharon said , as though somebody hadp115shoved a thermometer up his ass . There were the Open Heart cross and slogans  --  Open your heart to Jesus . Open your heart TODAY  --  with Leo Bebb , Evangelist , printed in Gothic underneath plus the address and hours of services . The child showed the card to her mother who did n't seem interested but took a red crayon out of her purse and handed it to her . The child colored the heart red and then started coloring Bebb red too . Bebb said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . I need those to see with . " I said , " Lucille told Sharon on the phone this morning that fellow Golden has turned up again . " Bebb looked up at me with an expression like the one on his card . He said , " She says she saw him snooping around the barn yesterday in a pork-pie hat and windbreaker . She recognized him by his shape right off . She thinks he 's the one left the rose in the hymnal Sunday stuck in at Jerusalem the Golden . She says it was his calling card . " I said , " You 'd have noticed him , would n't you ? He 's not one to melt into a crowd . " Bebb said , " Antonio , if that man had 've been there , everybody would have noticed him . You did n't notice him , did you ? " I shook my head . Bebb said , " You ca n't always be sure what Lucille sees and what she just thinks she sees . ' When you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wanted to keep the conversation going , any conversation , because once it stopped , I started having silent conversations with myself , so I said , " What do you think yourself ? " Bebb said , " I 'm not going to say she did n't see him ,  |p116Antonio  . She might have seen him . " I said , " Who do you think he is , Bip ? " The train gave a lurch , and Bebb stretched one arm along the back of the child 's seat to steady himself . The sun was coming in through the milky window , and the air was thick with cigarette smoke . He said , " Remember the fig tree , Antonio . When his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh . ' " " You 'll have to explain , " I said . Bebb said , " Antonio , let me put it this way . I 've been preaching the kingdom since you were in didies , and there 's lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , you can feel it , Antonio . You stand up there in the pulpit and see No Sale written smack across every last face . But , " he raised one cautionary finger , " there are other times too , praise God . There are times when your preaching shines out hot like the sun , and the congregationstarts putting forth leaves . The young and tender shoots , Antonio . They feel summer is nigh , and they show it . " As Bebb shifted his position , I caught sight of the child 's coloring . She had borne down hard on the crayon , but she had been careful about the eyes as he had told her . The face was a deep , waxy crimson , but the eyes were white . He looked badly burned . I said , " Do you think Mr. Golden 's one of your young and tender shoots then who 's come north to follow the sun ? " " I 'd admire to think that , " Bebb said . He gazed at me thoughtfully a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Lucille thinks he 's from outer space . " Bebb said , " Antonio , when the kingdom 's preachedp117hot , there 's no telling what 's going to start sprouting . Life starts sprouting , new life . Maybe that means new worlds too . There 's no talk about outer space in Scripture , Antonio , but there 's angels and archangels . There 's principalities and powers in the heavenly places . " " A power called Golden , " I said , " a pork-pie principality , " and for the first time I found myself thinking about what our mouths were talking about  --  that wide , flat figure drifting through the high grass in Texas , that queer sub-paunch which for all I knew was where he folded out of sight his spangled wings or Martian appendages . I thought of Lucille 's and my folie a deux and how Mr. Golden had been sitting there in the subterraneancouncil chamber with his antenna sticking up as Bebb settled down beside him . I might even have asked Bebb about it then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you think you 've gotten rid of a splitting headache and then you bend over to pick something up and there 's a sickening thud behind your eyeballs again : suddenly my nephew was thumping on the door again with his sea-chilled fist , my wife standingunder the hall light in her nightdress . I said , " Give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , " but Bebb did n't hear me , not expecting to hear such a thing . He had leaned closer and spoke in a confidential voice . He said , " Of course I 'm not kidding myself . He may just be from the I.R.S. They 've been giving me nothing but trouble for years . " " Here 's hoping , " I said . The night before when Tony finally pulled himself together and went upstairs to bed , I decided to go to bed myself right there on the couch . If Sharon askedp118me about it in the morning , I planned to say I just had n't wanted to wake her up again climbing in beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Chris had put it , and I pulled it up over me and lay there for a while in the dark listening to Tony taking a shower upstairs . Whatever else you might want to say about him , I thought , you had to admit that at least he took plenty of showers . He took at least one a day and sometimestwo , one at home and one at the gym . I do n't think I ever actually went to sleep that night , but I was n't wide awake the whole time either . I spent most of the night in no-man 's land and covered a lot of it while I was there . One of the few things I retain from my Italian mother'ssporadic attempts to bring up my sister and me as Catholics is a feeling that you 're not supposed to pray for the dead or else that Protestants are against it . Either way , to pray for them is connected with heresy in my mind , and I 've always tended to avoid it the way I tend to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , I 've prayed to the dead which I suppose is a blacker heresy still . At least I 've said things to them in my mind and tried to imagine what they might say back which is maybe what praying is all about anyway . That night , half asleep and half awake , I spoke to my twin sister Miriam . I said , " What 's supposed to happen next if you do n't mind telling me ? " I said , " That roly-poly little wop you named after me , the one who told you the plot of Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein and the Wolf Man the time I brought them up to the hospital to say goodbye to you for the last time , well he 's not a roly-poly little wop any more.  |p119He  's Tarzan the Ape-man and Roger the Lodger rolled into one . He 's not Costello any more . He 's the Wolf Man . He 's been sitting here in his bathing suit blubberinglike a ten-year-old . He 's antlered me in case you want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am thirty-nine y cars old and my wife has been screwed by my nephew and my hairline is receding and for the first time in my life I can believe that someday I 'm going to get old and die like you . " Conversations with the dead are never very satisfactory . The dead are not very interested in what you tell them and usually do n't have much to say . Death is apparentlyas much of a rat race as life is , and they 've got other things on their minds . I do n't picture them sitting around in chairs like the cemetery scene in Our Town or cooling their heels in God 's outer office singing Bach . As much as I can picture them at all , I picture them hurryingoff someplace like the White Rabbit in Alice . They do n't even stop when you speak to them , just look back at you over their shoulders maybe . I could dimly picture Miriam looking back at me as I spoke . I said , " Say something , for God 's sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm sorry , Tono . " My nephew had already said that , and he 'd sounded sorrier than she did . I said , " What do I do , for Christ 's sake ? Do I tell her I know or pretend I do n't ? Do I send him back to Charlie ? Do I ask for a divorce ? Do I wait till I catch them in the act and take care of them both with one bullet ? Do I play it like wop opera or like Noel Coward or do n't I play it at all ? " " You 're the boss , " she said , moving on as if I was after a dime for a cup of coffee . I said , " What the hell kind of answer is that ? Havep120you forgotten he 's your son ? " She said , " My son was a little butterball who could never keep his pants zipped . " I said , " That 's just the trouble , he still ca n't , " and she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a life to depend on it . There was moonlight on the rug like snow , the baby blanket up to my chin and my bare feet sticking out . I was boring my dead sister to death . I said , " You died before you got to meet Sharon , but have you ever seen her from wherever you are ? Can you see things from there ? " " Oh God , Tono , " she said , " I suppose maybe I could . " " Then do me a favor and see her sometime , " I said . " She 's something to see , I can tell you . And see me . See him . Help us , " I said . " Help us . " She said , " Ciao , Antonio . " She had places to go . I was almost asleep again , on the barbed wire fringesof it anyway , and could n't keep up with her any more . " Help us . Help us , " I said drowsily . She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep her there any longer . From the Duchess'stea-party or whatever it was . A few hours later I made it on stiff legs into the kitchen for coffee . Sharon was there already . She was sitting at the table with Bill in her lap feeding him his bottle and apparently enjoying it . She had her nose and upper lip drawn down a little in a way that made me think of the Virgin in Michelangelo 's Pieta . She did n't look up as I came in , holding the bottle tilted down top121Bill 's mouth with one finger against his fat cheek to tickle him with if he started going to sleep on her . Her legs were crossed , one bare foot in midair throbbing slightly with her pulse . I could see down her neck to where the tan ended and the pale , freckly part began . " ' The Instant 's by the toaster , " she said , still too busy with Bill to look up , and it occurred to me that this was the first time I 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd ever seen before , or wanted to see . Or this was the first time that it was all of me that was doing the seeing . She was looking down at the baby drowsing in the crook of her arm . One way or the other it was the first time we had met fully . I thought at the time that it was the turning point of my life , that all our four destinies , Sharon 's and Bill 's and Tony 's and mine , hung on whatever I said next or did n't say right there in that kitchen with the steam from the kettle turning to cumulus in the morning sun. looking back , I see it as a medieval painting , our three figures motionless in gold-leaf , the words coming out of by mouth like a streamer  --  Benedicta to in mulieribus . My question at the time was what words would they be , what fatal , sad annunciation ? What urbane evasion orPagliaccian tirade ? Ne time as , Maria . We were frozen in the golden air , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night on the couch so I would n't wake you up . " She glanced at me then , her eyes more green than brown in the sunlight . She frowned slightly . The sound of my voice made Bill turn his head . The nipple was still half in his mouth . There was a trickle of yellowy milk on his chin . It seemed a turning point at the time , but I 'm not so sure now . When you think you 've reached a turningp122point , the chances are you 've already passed it . It was probably sometime during the night that I 'd decided without knowing it that the injuries I 'd sustained were critical but that the bleeding was all internal and was going to stay that way . I would see to it that from the outside nobody noticed a thing . Unless Sharon noticed . She hitched the baby over to her other arm so she could re-cross her legs , and the nipple came out of his mouth with a little rubbery pop . Her smile caught me off guard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somber , frowning face was for public consumption only , and the inside story was that hang-dog , Rastus flash of teeth and eyes . Tony had said he was sorry . Miriam had said it . For all I knew maybe Sharon 's smile was saying she was sorry too  --  sorry about my night on the couch , sorry she 'd made me believe I was going to get old and die someday  --  but you could n't be sure . The rubbery pop of Bill 's nipple had a vaguely indecent sound . Maybe she was just smiling at that . When Tony came down in his Saturday uniform of spectacularly faded jeans and decaying loafers held together with adhesive tape , I watched eagle-eyed from the toaster to see what would pass between them . He said , " What 's for breakfast , Shar ? " She said , " Cow flops . " That 's what passed between them . The rage and tears that I 'd witnessed that night had happened before , and they would happen again , and I suppose they both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in another way the time when they were n't happening . There was no furtive glance of guilty lovers either , no secret touch as he passed by her , the sole of one loafer flapping loose against the linoleum . Whatever they had been once , and for all I knew mightp123become anytime again , they were not lovers then . Any fool could see it . The furtiveness and the guilt were all mine . My antlers glittered as I turned my eyes back to the smoking toaster and my enflamed visions . Sharon was tan except where she was pale and freckled like thrushes ' eggs . Tony was advancing on her with the jouncing buffoon of his own flesh straining forward to point his way , bobbing in front of him like a clapstick . Every detail complete with close-ups and tricky angle shots ran through my mind like a stag movie as I stood there scraping the black off my toast into the sink . I was the only one of the three of us with something to hide . Sharon told me Lucille had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station because their car was being fixed . He had errands to do in New York , Lucille had said . Also Mr. Golden had turned up again . Tony was sitting between us with his chin in a bowl of shredded wheat and bananas . His manner with me was all Tom Swift . He did n't show even the faintest trace of discomfort or remorse . He 'd succeeded in unloading all that on me the night before so that now I was the one who had a hard time looking him in the eye . " Do you mind driving him , Big Bopper ? " Sharon said . " This is my Evelyn Wood morning . " Big Bopper  --  a name that dated back to the first time I had ever seen her as she had come down the stairs of the Charles Addams manse in Armadillo in a pair of white sailor pants and a shirt the color of raspberry ice . Bebb and I had been waiting for her in Bebb 's car with the radio playing a song called Chantilly Lace sung by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name she 'd ever called me by.  |p124As  I heard her call me by it again now , I knew that I had to get away that day  --  their fresh-faced guilt was too great a reproach to my shifty-eyed innocence  --  and almost before I knew what I was about , I heard myself saying that I had some errands to do myself in New York and might as well keep Bebb company on the train . Maybe I wanted Sharon to ask me not to go . I do n't know . She did n't . She took Bill and put him over her shoulder , making circles on his back with the flat of her hand until he produced a small , wet rattle.  |p125WHEN  THE TRAIN got to Grand Central , Bebb and I went our separate ways . I left him at a freight elevator . He said it would take him down to where the subways were . He stood in it looking grim and preoccupied , I thought , a trussed , bulky package of a man . I watched the doors slide shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up red . The arrow pointed down . How far down was anybody 's guess . I had no errands in New York , of course , and had been too busy dreaming on the train to dream up any , so when the doors snapped shut on Bebb , I found myself with no idea where to go next . For a moment I consideredtaking the next train back . I would return unex/pectedly to the house and surprise them in the act . Or I would return unexpectedly to the house and purposely not surprise them in the act . They would find me sitting downstairs and know that I knew what they were up to without having to surprise them . But this was nonsense , of course , because they could n't be up to anything what with Chris and the baby at home . Only instead of being relieved by that thought , I was depressed by it . It was as if I had gone away with Bebb and left them there not for my sake but for their sakes , and the fact that like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sense of emptiness and loss . With no goal in mind , I could just as plausibly have walked east from Grand Central or south , but instead I headed north up Park . My sense of the color and charracterof New York geography dates back to my childhoodthere , and I think still in terms of my childhood frontiers . South of Forty Second Street is still the old Aquarium at the Battery with its tank full of horseshoe crabs and the statue of George Washington in front of the Treasury Building and a store called Shackman 's where you could get the best favors and false faces in the city . West of Fifth is the Natural History museum and the old Met and Riverside Drive , especially the part up around Grant 's Tomb , but otherwise it 's no-man 's land . As a child I never knew anybody who lived west of Fifth , and I 'd have to think hard to remember one now . East from Fifth is shops , the romance diminishing as you move from Tiffany 's and Schwarz 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delicatessens on Lexington . East of Lexington is drunks asleep in doorwaysand the old El . Park is the lights left on in the Grand Central Building at Christmas-time in the shapep127of a cross , is apartment building awnings either Rolls Royce maroon or ping-pong table green sheltering doormenin white gloves with whistles and black umbrellas in case of rain . Park Avenue is the rainiest part of the city . And going north on Park is still going home . It had n't actually been home for thirty years , but north on Park was the way I went that morning of the day when I first woke up to the knowledge that my wife had taken as her lover a child who was named after me . In the spring a young man 's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love , the old poem goes , and in a different key maybe but nonetheless , my thirty-nine-year-old fancy turned the same way . Heading north up Park towardthe home we 'd shared as children , I thought of my sister Miriam , whom I 'd loved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get much out of her that sleepless night on the couch when I 'd tried to tell her ghost what was going on , and I wondered what I would have gotten out of her if she 'd still been alive somehow . She would probably have been furious in some predictably Italian way though whether more furious at Sharon for being the seducer ( this would have been her inevitable choice among my various versions as I suppose it was also mine ) or at Tony for letting himself be seduced or at me for not smelling the rat before it was served up cold at three o'clock in the morning , I could not say . I thought of how year after year one nurse or another in rubber-soled white Oxfords had taken us off to the Park where she conferred with her buddies and Miriam and I roller-skated or drew on the sidewalk with pieces of hard , flat chalk that looked like marble chips or yelled at each other in those vaulted brick tunnels to hear the echo bounce . I thought of how she was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of her bones broken , but of how Charlie and her two boys and I had all been at the cemetery when she was buried on Christmas Eve day . It was when I realized that I had n't been back to the cemetery since then that I found the errand I 'd been looking for . I would go out to Brooklynand check in at Miriam 's grave , and I would do it not just because I had nothing better to do but because it seemed the right time to do it . But I 'd have lunch first . At Forty Ninth Street I thought of the United Nations and my old friend Ellie Pierce , who as far as I knew still did volunteer work at the information desk . My lovely , pre-Raphaelite Ellie with her brocade slipper pumping up and down on the soft pedal as she played Mozart for me or . Satie . Ellie , that indefatigable collector of causes , so Vassar and Urban League and Bergdorf 's . God knows how long we were engaged in an unofficial but deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be anything but old comrades forever and I drifted off to Armadillo to write an expose of Leo Bebb and ended up coming home with his adopted daughter as my bride . Ellie had been wonderfulabout everything , showed Sharon around the city and had us to dinner a few times with some of her U.N . friends , and I had n't seen her since . It was Ellie I 'd have lunch with . A man who has been cuckolded by his nephew is in a uniquely vulnerable state , especially if it happens to take place in the spring when he 's vulnerable enough anyway , and the thought of seeing Ellie again gave me a sense of might-have-been as strong as heartburn as I pictured us ambling for an hour or two down some little stretch of the road we had not taken . But when I gotp129to the U.N . they told me at the information desk that she did n't work there any more . They thought she might still come in from time to time to do some filing upstairs , but nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd been in the hospital that winter . Maybe she was still there . It was all vague and doubtful , and I 'd about decided to give up and have a sandwich by myself when somebody came up behind and tapped me on the shoulder . When I turned around , there was Ellie . She looked older and more chic than the last time I 'd seen her , less pre-Raphaelite and flowing than Edwardianand a little angular . But she looked well too . She had some gray in her hair and was wearing a gray suit with a yellow silk blouse and a yellow rosebud pinned to her lapel . She said , " Tono , I could n't believe my eyes , " and when we kissed each other on the cheek , she smelled , as she always had , of shampoo . I said , " You look terrific . They 've been trying to tell me you were in the hospital , " and she said , " Oh , that was just for a little repair work . " She blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant was a hysterectomy  --  that most unhysterical of wombs , which had never known any action , out of action at last . " Tell me , " she said , with just the slightest hesitation as she found the right name , " where 's Sharon ? " I said , " She 's home learning how to read . " " Tono , Tono , " Ellie said . I said , " Nobody calls me Tono any more . Sharon says it 's too close to her baby word for number two . " When was the last time I 'd called it number two ? " Well , you ca n't blame her for that , " Ellie said . Then , " What was her baby word , " which was the last thing in the world she wanted to know but it gave herp130time to look me over . Did I look older to her , I wondered . My hair had no gray in it , but there was less of it . I wished I 'd put on a clean shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call it no-no for some obscure reason . " " Tono Parr , " she said , smiling and shaking her head at the same time as though I had dropped something and broken it . We had lunch together in a French restaurant , my old friend and I. Ellie was the one who knew about it . You had to walk down stairs to get into it , and it was small and smelled of garlic and household ammonia . I had a martini first , Ellie a Cinzano , and she told the waiter what she wanted to eat in her lovely Vassar French . Then she said , " Now tell me what you 've been up to , Tono  --  I ca n't help calling you Tono anyway . I want to hear everything , " and before she was through , she very nearly did . " Open your heart to Jesus , " Bebb 's ad said . " Open your heart TODAY , " and I wanted to open my heart there to Ellie Pierce not so much so she could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that to talk about the things that go on in your heart is to take a lot of the bloom off them , and it 's true that it does . But it 's true too that unless you talk about them , you ca n't be sure that anything 's going on there at all . I said , " Well , we 've got this baby for one thing . He 's not gettingany younger , and he 's still bald as an egg . " Bill was the last thing I would have expected to tell her about first . Ellie made me tell her more about him , and I wondered again about the hysterectomy and if she still had a womb and what would ever become of it if she did.  |p131I  told her about how I was teaching English again and about the wooden thing I was building out in the shed . She seemed pleased about the wooden thing because I used to make smaller scrap-iron things during the years we 'd known each other . She said she was glad I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant she was glad there was still some tangible connection between whoever I had been then and whoeverI was now . She said , " Is it supposed to be anything , form ? " She had always liked things to be something . I told her I did n't think so , and when she asked me to describe it , I was reduced to trying to draw it on the tablecloth with my butter knife . " It looks like a big A , " she said , and she was right . I had n't noticed before , but it did . Was it Miriam 's Ashapedcast , I wondered , or A for Antonio which , the way things were happening , might turn out to be a brand new name for number two . " It 's the scarlet letter , " I said . She said , " You do n't change , Tono . " She looked so understanding sitting there behind her artichaut vinaigrette , so handsome and resourceful in her gray suit with the yellow rosebud . She looked as though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find the right place for in her file , nothing she could n't cross-index so the connections between things would come clear at last  --  the sea-smell of my nephew 's hair , Bebb 's face burned crimson where the crippled child had crayoned it , Laura Fleischman 's reading " poor naked wretches " out loud in class . I had opened my heart far enough to show Ellie my bald son and the contents of my woodshed . The question now was would I open it far enough to show her the rest.  |p132Would  I treat her to a glimpse of Lucille wobbling down the aisle of Open Heart in her French heels and Aimee Semple McPherson peignoir ? Would I raise for her the apparition of Leo Bebb at this very moment for all I could prove to the contrary meeting in full subterranean council with God only knew what ? Would I run off for her the reel of Sharon and my nephew that afternoon in March ? Ellie was asking me something about the drug situation at Sutton High School as I reached across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like when the furnace and the deep freeze happen to come on at the same time so that the lights go dim for a second or two and the TV fades . Ellie hardly hesitated in whatever she was saying , her face barely flickered , and then she was back running normally again . But the risk of overloading the circuits was clear . I gave her hand a comradely squeeze , withdrawing mine to my empty martini glass . I said , " How about telling me about you for a change ? " And she did . She told me how she 'd organized a group of tenants in Manhattan House to protest what she felt were discriminatoryrental policies . She told me about a museum tour of Greece she had taken . She talked about Mayor Lindsay and the subway strike . She used " we " more than " I " most of the time , but I got the impression it was something more like a committee than a twosome . I kept wondering if I 'd been right about the repair work , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening her heart about  --  how it felt to be empty inside , a dead end street . But if she opened her heart to Jesus on the subject , she did n't even take the chair out from under the doorknob for me . We agreed we would n't let years go by again till the next time . I wouldp133bring Sharon in , and we 'd all have dinner and go to the theater . I asked her if I could get her a cab , and she said no , she needed the exercise . We touched cheeks once more out on the sidewalk where the sun nearly blinded us after our dim lunch and then headed off in different directions . Ellie never found out what was in my heart , and I never found out what was in hers , and maybe it was for the best . Just our failure to was a familiar failure , and it was the familiar I needed that day , not open-heart surgery . My only regret after we parted was that I had n't asked her about Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands after Sharon and I got married . He had been the companion of my bachelorhood , but he and Sharon had disliked each other from the start , so Ellie took him . I 'd like to have heard how he was getting on at ManhattanHouse . I would also like to have been able to weep a little at Miriam 's grave  --  it would have been a kind of purge for me , and I knew Miriam would have enjoyed it  --  but it did n't work that way . I 've never been much good at tears on demand . At Miriam 's death-bed and funeral both , I remained dry-eyed . I cry best when I expect to least . I remember , for instance , when I took Sharon and the boys to see the movie of Hello Dolly , which is not what you 'd ordinarily think of as a tear-jerker . It was during the big restaurant scene when Barbra Streisand comes sweeping down the grand staircase in her satin and feathers , and everybody starts singing " Hello Dolly " and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing it , Satchmo himself sweating and grinning withp134his lips wobbling , that face that was turned out back in the days before black was beautiful , just black , and all of a sudden the tears were streaming down my cheeks and I had to stuff popcorn in my mouth . The other time I remember was at a swimming meet between Sutton and Portchester . It was a relay race , and by the time the last relay of swimmers had grabbed the batons and dived in , the noise bouncing back and forth from the tiled walls became so pure and intense that you could hear right down to a kind of distilled silence at the heart of it , and once again I found myself blinded . But there at my sister 's grave , I did n't even get a lump in my throat . At the cemetery entrance they had given me a map with the way I was to go marked out on it , but I missed a turn somewhere and wandered most of an hour down one avenue after another of mausoleums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every size and shape with just single names cut into them . GALLAGHER , KURTZ , CRUCETTI  --  With no first names or dates to get in the way they looked like final pronouncementsor the presidents of banks . By the time I located the small marker with PARR on it , my first feeling was just relief that I 'd finally made it . My parents shared a stone between them , but Miriam had one all to herself . Charlie had picked it out , I think , and it looked rather like him , a faded , canned-salmon-colored granite with the carving of her name still pale and unweathered . Miriam herself would probably have preferred something more on the order of the grieving angel who knelt nearby with a face that reminded me of Liberate . I noticed that though my parents were smooth and level , Miriam had sunk a little , and I decided to speak to the people at the gate about putting in some more sod . Itp135looked forlorn that way , like a fallen souffle . I stood there and thought about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear might come to make us both feel better , but no tear came . I could not seem to think her into anything much like reality . Even her name the way Charlie had had it carved did n't really seem hers . Miriam Parr Blaine . It made some kind of a career woman out of her , like Helen Gahagan Douglas or Grace Livingston Hill . Then my mind started wandering , and it was n't long before I was n't thinking about my sister or about anything else in particular , just staring down at the grass so hard I did n't see it , without a thought in my head . It 's not an easy business to stop thinking , and althoughaccording to Sharon it 's the whole point of yoga and can be achieved by anybody who works at it , I find it hard to imagine how that can be so . It seems to me that to work at not thinking must be to think about not thinking . As I stood there at my sister 's grave , my mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it had just happened that way , which seems to be how it is with most good things . Despite my mother 's efforts to make me a Catholic , I 'm afraid that in this regard anyway I turned out Protestant . If there 's any such thing as salvation , I suspect it 's not through works that we come by it but through grace . Something else happened there in Brooklyn that afternoonthat may have been through grace too although at the time I would n't have said so probably . I was still standing there in this kind of empty-headed trance , and then it was like what happens when , just as you 're about to go to sleep at night , you seem to trip over something and can feel the whole bed shake under you . I came to , I suppose you would say . Some stirring in the air orp136quick movement of squirrel or bird brought me back to myself , and just at that instant of being brought back to myself I knew that the self I 'd been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead as Miriam . I knew it not just in the usual sense of knowing but knew it in almost the Biblical sense of having sex with it . I knew I did n't just have a body . I was a body . It was like walkinginto a closed door at night . The thud of it jolted me down to the roots of my hair . The body I was was going to be dead . Through Sharon and Tony I 'd finally come to believe it , but through grace alone I banged right into it  --  not a lesson this time , a collision . You might say that there at my sister 's grave I finally lost my virtue , saw the unveiling of middle-age 's last and most intimate secret . There in Brooklyn I was screwed by my own death . I 'd taken a subway out , but I felt I needed a taxi goingback , and when I got to Grand Central again with forty minutes till the next train , I dropped into a bar and ordered myself a double martini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sequincovered , revolving globes that scatters light all over the place like snowflakes , and I was sitting there watching it when for the second time that day somebody came up from behind and tapped me on the back . It was Laura Fleischman . " I just happened to look through the window , " she said , " and there you were . " The momentum of her surprise had gotten her just as far as that , then stranded her there , speechless , in the flurry of light . I called her by name , knew perfectly well who shep137was , but it was as if there was something absurdly elementarythat I did n't know like who I was myself or whether it was our native language I was speaking ; and then " Carl ' West , " I said , of all inanities . " Have you got Carl West with you ? " Fitch  --  Abercrombie , battery  --  assault , it was the crudest kind of free association , and the moment it was out , I regretted it . What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two to happen , but I saw it all . She left her face and retreated to wherever it was she kept Carl West , and while she was inside there with him , the face she 'd left behind was totally unguarded . I 've heard it explained that when you sneeze , your soul leaves your body and people say God bless you to keep the devil from slipping into you and taking your soul 's place . My impulse was to say something like God bless you to Laura Fleischman for fear that if I did n't , I 'd have that face on my conscience for the rest of my life . But then her soul got back on its own somehow . She smiled , and said , " No , " by which I took her to mean not just that Carl West was n't there at Grand Central but that at least for the moment he was n't there inside with her any more either . " I 've been to the orthodontist , " she said , and when I made some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything wrong with her smile as far as I could see , she said , " It 's a molar that 's coming in crooked . " It turned out she was waiting for the same train I was , so I made her take the stool next to mine and asked her if she 'd have something to drink with me . She said she 'd like a 7-Up which made me feel like a child molester , but by the time the bartender brought it to her with a slice of lemon and a cherry , together with another mar/tini for me , the feeling was past . I was her English teacher again , at least had been once on some other planet . Sharon sitting in the kitchen that morning with Bill in her lap . My old friend Ellie telling me over lunch about rental policies at Manhattan House . Miriam off there in Brooklyn where I 'd forgotten on the way out to say she needed more sod and where the poor echo of her death had been drowned out by the thud of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door that night Sharon would n't go down and open it ? ) . It had been Ladies ' Day for me so far , and each of them I 'd sought out to give me God knows what only to come away from them if not empty-handed , at least with nothing in my hands like whatever it was I 'd expected . And now Laura Fleischman , whom I had n't sought out at all , and as we sat side by side on our leopard-skin stools with the light from the globe swarming around us , I thought of that loveliest of all French phrases , A l'ombre des jeunes flues en Fleur , which Scott Moncrieff renders as " Within a budding grove " when even a ploddingliteralism would come closer to the loveliness of it  --  " in the shade of young girls ' flowering . " John Skelton 's " Merry Margaret/As midsummer flower , /Gentle as falcon or hawk in the tower " comes as close to it in spirit as anything I know in English . In any case , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stamford in track and whether seniors ought to be allowed to cut gym in the spring to get ready for finals , but it was n't small talk . It was big talk because all that we both of us were was in it , and there was nothing left over of either of us to think about anything else while we were talking . And that is how we missed our train.  |p139Laura  noticed first . She picked up my hand to get a look at my wrist watch , and I bent forward to get a look at it too , and when our foreheads touched for a second , I noticed it less in my forehead than in my stomach where it felt like when the express elevator freefalls the first twenty floors . Two things could have happened then of which just one , needless to say , actually did , but to report that one only would be to report less than the truth . A thing ca n't be both itself and not itself , logicians say , but they must have been thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality anyway . What we live through in our dreams is no less a part of who we are than what we live through when we 're not dreaming , and the events of one leave marks no less deep than the events of the other . ' Who is to say that what actually happens in a man 's life is all that more important to him than what happens not to happen ? We missed our train , Laura Fleischman and I. It was an event as much a part of history as Neil Armstrong 's landing on the moon or Sharon 's telling my nephew there were cow flops for breakfast . There were no two ways about it . But two ways branched out from it . The exigencies of narrative force me to set them side by side . It would be more accurate to present them as a double exposure . The way we took and the way we did n't take . One way was this . I said , " So we 've missed it , so now what ? " Laura Fleischman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattling the ice . " I 've got a timetable here somewhere , " she said and started burrowing into a large straw pocketbook that looked as if it might have been her mother 's . I saw what she was after before she did and reached in after her to get it out before she buried it again , and there in her mother 's straw pocket/book , our hands touched . I might have gotten my hand the hell out of there and used it for smoothing the timetabledown on the bar top . Might have . The past subjunctive . That ultimate grammatical subtlety . That capsulizedmetaphysics . It was the point where the two ways branched . Let us say I might have but I did not get my hand the hell out of Mrs. Fleischman 's pocketbook . I had had two martinis not counting the one I 'd had with Ellie at lunch . The revolving globe had made it the last act of Peter Pan where they 're up in the tree at night and the fireflies are out . I had run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale if I felt like telling it . Laura Fleischman had n't moved her hand . So I folded her hand up in mine and shut my eyes and said , " It takes me back to dancing school . " She said , " What does ? " Even if you had n't happened to be holding her hand yourself , you could have told from her face that somebody was . I had seen her look that way in class when I 'd asked her a question she did n't know the answer to . " Your hand does , " I said . " It 's damp . Like a dancingschoolhand . " When you hold a girl 's hand and talk to her about holding it , you are holding more than a hand . She said , " I know . I know what you mean , " as though I had explained something that had needed explaining more than anything else in the world . The bartender put a saucer of potato chips between us . When I let her hand go , she moved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timetable . " Like which one can we take , " she said , running her finger down the column . " I 'll tell you what Bodhidharma would do , " I said . I emptied the potato chips onto the timetable and pick/ing it up with a hand at each side offered it to her . " Take one of these , " I said . She took a big one and broke part of it off with her teeth . I said , " Now you do n't have to take one at all . You 've already taken it . " " I 've got to be home for supper , " she said . I looked at my watch . I said , " Whoever heard of getting home for supper at quarter of four ? " " Bodhidharma maybe ? " she said . It was in Cocteau 's Beauty and the Beast , I think , where there was a scene of the beast in a long cape with a high , stiff collar walking down a corridor in his palace . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the corridor , they would swing open and there would be still more of the corridor beyond them , all paneled and mirrored like Versailles , and then another pair of doors . On and on . So it was with Laura Fleischmanand me that spring afternoon after we left the station according to this one of the two ways . Doors opened onto doors and they in turn opened onto other doors until finally we came to the last pair of doors , and they opened too . I tell her I 've thought of people I ought to see in the city the next day and have decided I might as well spend the night there rather than go home and have to come back again the next morning , so Laura Fleischman goes with me to the Gotham maybe or the Plaza and sits off in a corner somewhere looking at Cue or at a Van Cleef and Arpels showcase while I register , and going up in the elevator we speak like strangers , which we are , about how the best time in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just the backs of our hands touching , our knuckles , and the way her hair falls , I canp142see the nape of her neck and the top of her spine , and with her eyes lowered she looks like a girl being lectured by a nun . She has a nun 's face herself almost , a slow smile she does n't use any more than she has to and high , calm cheeks I can see framed in starched linen , embarrassedeyes . It is a white room , and when I open the window , the air has New York in it and springtime and carbon monoxide , and if when I am an old man somebodygives me some of that air to smell , it will either make me young again or kill me sure . A curtain balloons into the room . The sky is a dingy mauve , lights coming on . Laura Fleischman pushes her hair back off her bare shoulders and holds it behind her with one hand . ' We talk about something at the open window , and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking about because we are both of us waiting , and what we are waiting for is not just what is going to happen in that room but something farther off than that . A l'ombre des jeunes fines en fleur . In that flowering shade , I ca n't make out clearly by what sequence of events we have come here . I ca n't imagine , and I have tried hard to imagine , the things that were said , the doors that had to open around us and inside us to bring us through that final door . I suppose the corridor of the afternoon must have just kept extending before us , and we followed along without ever thinking farther ahead than the next turning . But there at the end there is nothing I ca n't see . I see the Beast , of course  --  the moist , imploring eyes , the hairy , furrowed brow and glistening snout , the stiff and arching horn . Beauty is by him . Gentle as falcon or hawk in the tower , Beauty is the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . Somewhere between her pity and her love , within that cleft and confluence , he rises up a prince.  |p143The  other way was this . I reached into Mrs. Fleischman'sstraw pocketbook and took the timetable out . We had just time to pay the check and get down to the track before the next train left . We could n't find a seat together , but I got one directly in front of hers and talked to her for a while over the back until my neck began to cramp . Then she settled down to a creased paperback of Great Issues in American History and I looked out of the window and watched as far as 125th Street and a little beyond until the martinis began to take their effect together with the rockabye jouncing of the New Haven roadbed and I fell asleep . Laura woke me when we got to Stamford . " Mr. Parr , " she said , " we 're here , Mr. Parr , " and opening my eyes to her face bending over me , I could n't be sure which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the moment was both itself and not itself , whatever logicians may say . I dropped her off at her house on my way home , and we shook hands in the car as she thanked me for the lift and the 7-Up I 'd bought her at the station . It was dusk when I got home myself . Sharon met me in the hall . She said , " Listen . When Bip got back from the city , Luce was gone , and she is n't back yet . That was a couple of hours ago . She never goes out by herself and their car 's busted anyhow . Bip 's in a sweat . " She had on her black leotards with some kind of wraparoundskirt over them . It seemed weeks since the last time I 'd seen her , and I was about to kiss her hello when I stopped myself and then in a split second stopped myself from stopping myself and kissed her . She said , " I 'm glad you 're back anyway . " At Miriam 's grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my throat happen . Here , it was no trouble at all.  |p144BEBB  DEPLOYED US like troops . Although it was n't raining , he had on his black raincoat that pulled under the arms and his narrow-brimmed hat which was too small for him . He was carrying a flashlight as long as a nightstickand arrived unannounced while we were having our Saturday night supper . Tony had gone upstairs to get ready for some kind of date he had lined up , and Sharon and Chris and I were having our coffee . Bebb said , " I 'm going to be honest with you , I do n't like it . If it was anybody else , you might think she went off to a picture or someplace and just did n't leave word she 'd be late . Not Luce . Besides , the car 's on the fritz , and she was never one to go in for walking any morep145than she had to , ca n't anybody blame her for that . Why Sharon , you know what her balance is like even when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that steady , " he said , bringing the butt of his flashlight down on the table , " and on those spikes of hers she has n't got a chance . She took off on wheels , that 's for sure . What we 've got to find out is where she took off for and why she took off . " He gave each of us an assignment . Sharon was to stay home with the baby in case anybody called . Bebb and Chris and I were to make the rounds of railway stations , bus depots , and taxi stands to see if we could find out anything there . " There 's no use calling , " he said . " I tried that . Right off they think you 're out to make trouble for somebody and clam up . " On our way we were to drop Tony off at Bebb 's house so if Lucille came back while we were away , she would n't find the place empty . He did n't say that of the two boys , Tony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Sharon explained that Tony had a date , Bebb yelled up the stairs to him , and he came down in his undershorts with a towel around his neck and his hair standing up in the air from having just been washed . Bebb said , " Tony , I 'm asking you to give up your pleasure tonight and help me find my wife because my soul is exceeding sorrowful , and I need you . Will you do it ? " and Tony said , " Yes , sir . " I had never heard him call anybody sir before . Then Bebb said , " Now we 're all going to bow our heads , " and none of us was quick enough to grasp what he 'd said until he 'd bowed his own head and started praying . His bald scalp glistened in the kitchen light . He had his eyes clamped shut and his face screwed up tight . He said , " Oh dear friend Jesus , who art the hope ofp146sinners and the mender of the broken-hearted , we need thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherd of the sheep , and we are here to tell you one of thy sheep is lost . We do n't know where to start looking . We do n't even know whether she was in her right mind when she wandered off or whether her vexed and troubled spirit had led her to seek comfort in the bottle where she 's used to finding it . We do n't even know whether she went off on her own or somebody come and took her off by force or guile . There 's nobody here knows better than you she 's a sinner like the rest of us , but life has n't been a bed of roses for her either . Please put your love around her like a warm coat so nothing hurtful can get at her wherever she is . And help us go forth now and do our best to find her . We ask it for her sake and our sake , both . And for thy mercy 's sake too . Amen . " He pronouncedamen with a long a . Bebb 's prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spell : Tony in his underpants with his feathery hair floating over his head like a black cloud ; Chris caught halfway between the table and the sink with his thumb and forefinger in a pair of milky glasses ; Sharon holding her face in the V of her hands so her eyes were pulled sideways . I was the only one with open eyes , and when Bebb raised his head from his praying , he looked into them and said , " Antonio , there is more rejoicing in heaven over the one lost one that 's found than over the whole ninety and nine that never got lost in the first place . " We left Tony and Sharon in the two different houses each near a telephone and with however many miles there were of night between them . I had n't arranged things that way . Bebb had . I caught a glimpse of Chrisp147sitting there beside me with just a little glow from the dashboard lighting him up around his father 's lashless eyes , and I wondered if he knew about his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . I decided that whatever he thought about it , he probably did n't think about it as much as he thought about lots of other things , and maybe that was just as well for him or maybe it was n't . When we got to Sutton , I let him and Bebb out at the bus station , and I drove on down to the railroad . The ticket window was closed and I could n't locate anybody in the waiting room or the freight office , but across the tracks I saw what looked as if it might be a porter sitting on a bench under a light bulb . Climbing the moldering stairs of the overpass , I crossed over and described Lucille to him . Skinny with black glasses , I said , pushing sixty , maybe a little unsteady on her feet . Through my description , she emerged as stark as the last name on one of those Brooklyn monuments . CRUCETTI . The man turned out to be a taxi driver . He shook his head and said he 'd only been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks and said , " Try him . " There was a large man leaning up against the wall under a sign that had MEN on it with an arrow underneath , and when he saw us both turn to look at him at the same time , he raised one arm to us . He had on a pork-pie hat and a windbreaker , and his pants hung loose and baggy on him like sails . I recognized him right away as Mr. Golden . Just supposing the impossible to be possible , I thought , how did you approach a Principality or a Power or even a man from Mars ? With tears in your eyes and excuses on your lips ? The way a missionary approaches a Fijip148Islander ? Did you approach him at all ? That one arm raised in salutation  --  was it raised across the littered tracks only , across the candy wrappers , fruit peels , toilet paper dried and soaked and dried again until it had turned to divinity , seafoam ? Or was it raised across lightyears , was it raised maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separates what is holy from what people throw out of train windows and flush down cans ? This side of getting back in the car and telling Bebb I could n't find anybody to ask , I suppose the prudent thing would have been just to wait there and let Mr. Golden approachme if he felt like it . But curiosity led me on . I mounted once again that dingy Bridge of Sighs , walked a second time past FUCK You in lipstick and a place where somebody had tossed his cookies , and wondered if maybe to reach the high angels this was the kind of route you always had to take . Mr. Golden had n't moved from his place under the sign that said MEN . He smiled as I approached . His teeth were strong and white but you could see that all the back ones were missing . " Mr. Golden ? " I said , extending my hand , and he said , " Who he ? " He was dressed as if for work  --  he could have been a foreman of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station suggested that he had some professionalreason for being there ; but as soon as he started talking , I had the feeling that the clothes he had on were play clothes and his being there at the station was just part of a game he was playing  --  not a cat-and-mouse game but something like ring-around-the-rosy or flying a kite . A suburban railroad station at nine or ten o'clock on a Saturday night is n't the place you 'd normally think of going just for the hell of it , but I had a hunch thatp149this was why Mr. Golden had gone there . He was having fun . I said , " Have n't I seen you someplace before ? " and he said , " If a man keeps his eyes open , there 's no telling what he 'll see in this world . The trouble is most of the time we go around like blind men . Think what it would be like to be blind this time of year . " With his thumbs in his armpits , he took a deep breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said it as though he was confessingto some amiable quirk , his eyes sparkling like a girl 's . " Just breathing the air gives me the biggest kick . I would n't miss it for anything . " His voice was on the high side , like a taut rubber band when you pluck it . I said , " You 're the mystery man of the year . Nobody knows who you are or what you 're after . What 's the story anyway ? " He said , " Can you name me anybody who is n't a mystery man ? When you come right down to it , what does anybody know about who anybody is or what anybody'safter . " I said , " Does the name Leo Bebb mean anything to you ? " " Lifesaver ? " he said . He had taken them out of his windbreaker pocket and offered me one which I accepted . Spearmint . He did n't take one himself but put the pack back in his pocket . " Does the name such-andsuchmean anything to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite . " I do n't even know if you mean anything to me yourself yet . " I said , " First you turn up at the funeral of Herman Redpath . Then you turn up in Connecticut and are seen hanging around Open Heart . Now you turn up here . " He was listening to me attentively , I thought , his lipsp150slightly pursed , but he was n't looking at me . He was looking up at the sky where way up , too high to hear , a plane was slowly passing over blinking a red light . I said , " Is it any wonder we 'd like to know what you 're up to ? " He had a lean , fine-featured face , sallow and creased without the faintest trace of whiskers . He had a smallish head and a stringy neck and then this body that looked about six sizes too big for him and this heavy garland of flesh swelling out around his loins as though inside his clothes he had started to roll down some cumbersome undergarment . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet there was something about the way his pants hung that made me wonder if he weighed anything at all . He said , " I do n't want to keep on giving you smart answers , but do I have to be up to something ? Do I have to be some kind of crook or crank or queerie ? " I said , " There 's no law that says you 've got to tell me anything you do n't want to . " He said , " There 's laws about everything else . " I said , " If the tables were turned , you 'd want to know about me . " " There 's no need to turn the tables , " he said . " I want to know about you with the tables just like they are now . Tell me about yourself . " Possibly he was an undercover agent for the I.R.S. , Bebb had said . Possibly when Bebb preached the Kingdom , he was somebody the Kingdom had taken root in like a mustard seed and who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bebb had also said . Possibly , as Lucille and Bebb had both said , he was from outer space . " Silvers you might see most anytime if you keep your eyes open and look for the ones has hair and facesp151the same color , " Bebb had told me once , " but goldens are scarce as hen 's teeth . " Possibly he was a hen 's tooth . Whichever he was , I thought , assuming he was any of them , he would have a reason for wanting me to tell him about myself , and for a moment or two , standing there in the night , I almost considered telling him except that I would n't have known where to start or where to stop either , so I just said , " Lucille Bebb 's missing . ' We do n't know where she 's gone . " It was the first time I 'd caught him looking directly at me , and all the life there was in him seemed to rise up into those young eyes of his as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . He said , " Yes . Well , that 's how things happen . It 's just not the biggest surprise in the world , that 's all . She 's had to carry that pitiful little death around Jesus only knows how long , and she was n't exactly a tower of strength to start with . I 'm sorry she 's lost , " he said , and as he said it , the main part of the life drained back down into his face again . His eyes were looking at me now in the normal way of eyes as if to judge how sorry I was myself that Lucille was lost , and I realized that up till now I had n't been sorry at all much , just interested how we were going to end up finding her  --  passed out in a corner somewhere or wobbling off into the woods , maybe some friend taking her off on a bender while Bebb was away in the city . I said , " You have n't seen her then ? " He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " You know Bebb . " He said , " Look , do I know this ? " He had taken a pinch of his cheek between his thumb and forefinger and gave it a little tug as though to loosen his face , takep152it off even . " Do I know these ? " he said and extended both his hands in front of him , turning them first palms up and then palms down . " You 're old pals , " I said , wondering why Bebb had lied , had said maybe the man was this that or the other . All the time Bebb had spent speculating about who or what Mr. Golden might be , inside his shirt he 'd probably been wearing a locket with a lock of Mr. Golden 's hair in it . He said , " Pals is your word . I did n't say pals , " and I thought Oh Bip , you have been given back to me unstained . He was n't Bebb 's pal , he was just a soul Bebb had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his pork-pie hat looking at me through those lovely eyes as though he knew he 'd given me something back I had n't wanted to part with . I said , " You mean all this time you 've just admired him from a distance . " " Oh sweetheart ! " he said . " You want to know the distance ? " He put his hands in his pockets , and rocking back on one heel all three hundred or zero pounds of him , he swung the other foot forward and took a carefullymeasured stride . Then he took two more just like it . I thought the fourth stride was going to be the same , but he cut it about in half , scraping a little at the concreteplatform with the toe of his sneaker as though to mark an exact spot . " The front pew ? " I said . His strides had landed him about ten feet away from me beyond the range of the overhead light so I could n't see his face any more . On the far track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it set his pants flapping , and the racing lights lit him up fromp153behind like a statue . All through the train 's noisy passage he was evidently talking , gesturing , and when the last car shot by , he kept right on into the soft and sudden wake of silence . It was like the reading you do in dreams  --  word for word what he said made sense enough , but I could n't quite make out what it was all about . " Time and space , " he was saying . " You 've got all the time in the world and not enough space to swing a cat . Month after month , week in week out , " he was saying there in the dark , " all the doo-dah day . Well , you get so after a stretch you know his face better than you know your own face . There 's not a point in the world trying to hide anything from each other , " he said . " What 's the point ? The cat 's out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bag , you would n't be there in the first place . Ilide what ? " He said , " I set it down as an eternal rule of life that what works just fine on the inside does n't work a hoot on the outside . Say all you want or mostly want anyway is to chew the fat about the old days , just shake hands again , why not ? But the brushoff 's what you 're like to get . The cold shoulder . " He was holding one palm out toward me vertically like a traffic cop , the rails behind him glinting in the moonlight . " Soon as they spot you coming down the pike , they think it 's bound to be gim me or else . It 's two different worlds , " he said . " One of them you 're , oh , Peg o ' My Heart . The other you 're poison . Bad news . " He said , " It 's one world in and it 's another world out . " Stepping a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddest smile , all those back teeth missing or not in yet , he said , " In just a single life there 's so many worlds that a man 's days stretch out like the Milky Way . " He pushed the pork-pie up off his golden brow so I could see that what little hair he had ,  |p154flat  and mashed , was silver . " Worlds , " he said . " They leave you old and limp all the worlds you live in before your number comes up . " He had his head cocked to one side and hitched at his belt with one thumb . I was ready for anything by now , ready to see the belt hitched loose , the bolster around his crotch turning out to be folded wings unfolding . They folded out and up in origami folds and pleats and counterfoldsthe colors of stained glass . They were bigger than he was , and he was big enough . He said , " Tell Leo not to be afraid . It 'll all come out in the wash anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'll be picking him up in a minute . " He said , " I told him already . This afternoon I said , Look , Leo . Do n't be afraid . ' " I said , " This afternoon he did n't even know Lucille was missing . A breeze threatened to blow his hat off and he grabbed one side of the brim and held it in close to his wrinkled cheek . He said , " I meant do n't be afraid of me . " No time as . I saw him in his windbreaker with a lily in his hand , saw Bebb 's startled , fat face looking up at him . Still holding the pork-pie , he ducked his head shyly . " You 'll have to excuse me . I 've got bladder trouble . " Ile started to move off in the direction the arrow pointed . I said , " Just one more thing . Is Golden right ? " He paused and glanced back . Closer to the light , his face looked paler , more withery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right as any of them , " he said . " I 've had so many handles in my day . " The two stringy tendons at the back of his neck as he walked away , that huge , flat butt . I suppose I did n't get who he was then because Ip155did n't want to get it . He 'd said it straight enough in his own way . Who would n't believe in angels if he thought Ile could swing it , or visitors anyway from older , wiser worlds ? Silvers and goldens . I tried to swing it . I did n't even want to accept bladder trouble at that point . If he had a bladder , I wanted it to be only the kind of bladder you float on , fly with : Mr. Golden drifting along over the rooftops of Sutton calling down Do n't be afraid . It was obvious Bebb knew who Mr. Golden was and knew God knew what-all else besides , but I had no intention of asking him about it . Let him keep Mr. Golden under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I did n't even mention the meeting when I picked him and Chris up as they walked down the hill from the bus depot . They 'd had no more luck gathering clues about Lucille than I had . We drove on to Stamfordand Greenwich and had no luck there either . On our way back to Bebb 's house to drop Bebb off and pick up Tony , Chris said , " Maybe the thing you ought to do now is notify the police . " Bebb said , " Chris , I 've thought about that . I may have to turn to the police before I 'm through , but not yet . Sometimes the medicine 's worse than the bellyache . " I said , " Where do you think she 's gone , Bip ? " He said , " By this time maybe she 's gone home , and she 'll be waiting there for us when we pull in . " Chris said , " I have a hunch she 's not . " There was a silence as we rolled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars have at night . I was driving slowly , half thinking we might find Lucille walkingalong in the ditch . I kept picturing her suddenly looming up in the glare of the headlights in her French heels and gossamer.  |p156Bebb  said , " Chris , do you believe in E.S.P. ? " Chris said , " Yes . Do you believe in it ? " Bebb said , " I believe in it , and I ' have a feeling she 's not home either . " I said , " Can you put yourself in her shoes and figure out someplace she might have wanted to go specially ? " Bebb said , " There was one time years ago the place I found her in was a tree . Sharon and her , they 'd had them some kind of a fuss , and she 'd got herself up there somehow . She was in a tree reading Silver Screen . It was like getting a cat off a telephone pole . " " Silver Screen , " Chris said . Bebb said , " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've known her to take in two double features in a day . There was a place in West Palm she found that showed triples . " " Maybe she 's gone to the pictures , " Chris said . Bebb said , " Not any more . Those black glasses she wears , they 're because the light hurts her eyes . Even pictures hurt her eyes . She 's got so she ca n't stand light any more . Chris said , " Who can ? " He said it not to be witty but in a dreamy kind of way , wedged in there between Bebb and me in the dark . Bebb said , " Boys , I 'm not going to kid you . I 'm worried . I 've been worried for many years . " He said boys , but he was talking to himself and neither of us tried to say anything . I took my eyes off the white line just long enough to glance at him . That face that had looked on Golden plain . That face that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid his hands on the old brave 's wispy scalp and conjured the sap to rise . That pop-goes-the-weasel , jack-in-the-box face that at any time might spring open or shut on anything . It seemedp157to have settled , like an old house . The lower jaw had slipped forward . The cheeks hung . The eyes looked loose in their sockets . It was the color of the moon . The next thing he said was , " Chris , what 's your opinion of Anna May Wong ? " That Bip , as Sharon was apt to say with a mixture of resignation and awe whenever he did something particularlyBip-like . He worked his plump arm free and slid it around the shoulders of my nephew Chris , that movie fan and Shakespeare buff who dreamed of making the theater his life . With the moon in his face and God knows what in his heart , Bebb talked to him the rest of the way back about Anna May Wong and Leonore Ulric and Erich von Stroheim ; and Chris , that ectoplasmic boy , took from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were squeezed together in the front seat , and I could literally feel it happening in him . That Bip . We found Tony asleep on the couch in Bebb 's living room , and when we woke him up , he messed up his hair and threw his shoulders around to loosen them up . He said that nobody had either come or called . Bebb phoned Sharon then at our house , and you could see from his face that she was telling him the same thing . On my way home with Tony and Chris , we passed Laura Fleischman 's house . It was around midnight , and there was only one light on . The light was upstairs , and I wondered if it was Laura 's . I tried to picture her in bed there reading Great Issues in American History . I tried to picture her hair on the pillow , her nun 's face . It was hard to believe that only a few hours had gone by since I bought her the 7-Up . Maybe I had just dreamed it . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the longest day of my life , and it was hard to believe that I had n't dreamed the whole thing.  |p158THE  NEXT AFTERNOON Charlie Blaine and Mrs. Klingturned up for the second Sunday in a row . Spotting them from an upstairs window , Sharon went off like a burglar alarm . Bebb was phoning every hour on the hour to see if Lucille had turned up , which she had n't , and Sharon said I 'd have to take care of my relations by myself , so in desperation I ran downstairs and headed them off before they got into the house . In desperation I took them out to the shed to see my monument . Mrs. Kling gave it a look and said , " It looks anemic . If I was you , I 'd paint it . " There it was , turning ponderously on its chain from Mrs. Kling 's poke , an iceberg , a theology , whatever it was . The fall of the Roman Empire . Parts of it seemedp159to turn faster than other parts , little clusters of discs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . It was basically an A-shape with the pierced crosspiece in the middle that the tongues curved down through . It was the honest , pale color of raw pine , and I liked it that way . I said , " What shade would you suggest ? " She stepped back on one bulging calf , a fist on her hip . She squinnied at it . " Bright ones , " she said , as if addressingsomebody in the next room . " Bright ones and plenty of them . " She turned and stared at me  --  those heavy mink eyebrows , that tomato-colored mouth . Besideher , Charlie was the color of smoke in his gray spring overcoat that hung below his knees , a pearl gray fedora . She gave me a push on one shoulder . " Live it up a little , " she said . I said , " My God , maybe you 've got something , " which was the last thing I 'd expected to say , but I saw it suddenlypainted like a toy in paint-box colors  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick and glossy . Why not ? She said , " How about it , Charlie ? " wheeling on him . Charlie slipped his hand softly down one satiny flank of it . He said , " Well , it might just make it come alive . " And he was right . It might just make it come alive , I thought , and at the idea of painting it I could feel myself coming a little alive  --  a good brush to get up into those star shapes and crescent shapes , floating the colors down smooth and heavy along the flat surfaces , working them up into the angles of joints and the insides of curves . I said , " It would jazz it up all right , Charlie , that 's for sure . He smiled . It was one of the better moments my ex-brother-in/law and I ever had together , and we had Mrs. Kling to thank for it . When I could n't think of any way to stall them further , I finally brought them into the house . Chris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , barefoot , with an opaque look in her eye . The first thing she did was tell Charlie he did n't look up to snuff to her . It was the worst thing you could ever tell Charlie , and she knew it . He would n't let the subject drop . She said , " I do n't know , Charlie . You look a little . . . winded . " What followed was one of my worst momentswith my ex-brother-in-law , for which in this case I suppose I had Sharon to thank . He turned to Mrs. Kling as though they were alone in an emergency ward and said , " There , Billie . It 's what I 've been telling you . " Mrs. Kling said , " There 's nothing wrong with your wind , Charlie . You 've been all through that with Fletcher , and Fletcher 's tops . " Charlie said , " I do n't mean shortness of breath . I mean the feeling I get when I breathe in . " Sharon said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I managed to give her the eye as she said it , and , what her eye gave me back was shove it , which was not the most significant exchange we ever had , but what was significant about it was that it was the first time since I 'd found out about her and Tony that I 'd let our eyes exchange so much as the time of day . Charlie said , " Oh God , no , " with his left thumb creepingup under his left armpit and his fingers starting to work at his wishbone . " It 's in my throat . Way back . " Mrs. Kling said , " OK. , Charlie . Tell it like it is . " " Physical symptoms are n't the easiest things in thep161world to verbalize , " he said , " but I 'll give it another try . When I breathe in , it 's as if the air is hitting something it never used to hit before . There 's a kind of dry , cold sensation . It 's like there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Like a lump ? " Sharon said . " Not a lump , " Charlie said , swallowing . " I do n't think that 's what it is . It 's more like a sensation than an actual obstruction . " Mrs. Kling said , " Open up , Charlie , and hold your tongue down . " She took his lower jaw in her hand and pushed it in toward his Adam 's apple . His eyes were fixed glassily on the ceiling . " I 'll tell you one thing , " she said , peering in . " You had onions for lunch . And maybe a little cat mess . There 's no lump , Charlie . " Charlie touched the corners of his mouth with a handkerchief . He said , " It would be too far back to see any-way . " Mrs. Kling said , " All rightsy , if that 's how you want it . " She said it with ominous heartiness and swung abruptly around to me . " Give me a flashlight , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found one in the desk drawer and gave it to her . " Roger , " she said . " Have you got a closet big enough to hold three of us ? " " What are you up to , Billie ? " Charlie said . " You 're what I 'm up to , " she said . I took them to the hall closet . Sharon wanted to come in too , but there was n't room for four , and of the two of us Mrs. Kling wanted me . " He wo n't listen to another woman , " she said . Sharon shut the door on us , and Mrs. Kling and Charlie Blaine and I stood there for a few seconds inp162total darkness . Then Mrs. Kling switched on the flashlight . She told Charlie to put it into his mouth . She said , " Close your lips around it tight , Charlie , like you 're sucking a pickle . " The closet smelled of raincoats and shoes and Charlie'sonions , and Charlie was lit up inside like a pumpkin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame . There was a religious sheen on the underside of his nose . Mrs. Kling 's glasses glinted as she leaned toward him . I wondered what a stranger would have thought , what I would have thought myself if some fortuneteller had foretold the scene . Mrs. Kling and I in that closet with Charlie . Given the people we were , I suppose you could say it was inevitable . Everything was . I found the thought comforting . Mrs. Kling pushed me with her elbow . She said , " Look at there . " Her finger was black against Charlie 's translucentbeauty . She said , " Boy , is that ever plugged up . See that shadowy part ? " Her black finger was moving in the vicinity of his cheekbone . I said I saw it . " Tell him , " she said . " He thinks I 'm giving him a snow-job . " I said , " It looks like you 're plugged up all right , Charlie . " Charlie tried to say something , but with the flashlightin his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's those lousy sinuses . You 've got yourself an old-fashioned case of post-nasal drip , Charlie . What you feel in your throat is snot . " Later I found myself sitting on the foot of our bed trying to make conversation with Charlie through the open bathroom door . Mrs. Kling had prescribed a salt solution to be inhaled through the nose and spat out through the mouth . Charlie was doing it . Strapped as Ip163was for something to talk about , I decided against bringingup Lucille 's disappearance . Neither Sharon nor I had mentioned it so far . It would only have raised questions that I could n't answer , plus others that I could . I might have tried talking about the boys , but whenever I did that , he would steer the conversation around to how much a month it cost Sharon and me to keep them , and then whether I actually told him how much or less than how much or brushed the question aside , I always ended up sounding as though I was asking for more . Then Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of sterner stuff I suppose I might have talked to him about the boys and sex . I might have told him that it seemed to me sex for Tony was a hydroelectric dam that for the time being was being used for weight-lifting and broad-jumping and hanging African violets around in his jockstrap , not to mention all those showers , but that potentiallyit could supply the whole town of Sutton with light and heat or blow it off the map and himself with it , not to mention what it had blown off the map already . Or onto the map . I might have told him how it seemed to me that sex for Chris was a shadowy presence in the wings which was maybe why he wanted to make the stage his life . The only shadows on the stage were the shadows you knew about , and the roles were fixed there . Nothing could happen on the stage that was n't in the script . You did n't have to worry about the wings . But I could n't talk to Charlie about sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirtsleeves . In between rinsings , he would straighten up , and we would find ourselves facing each other in the mirror . His eyes looked dimly expectant , and what I found myself coming out with finally was the information that I'dp164gone out to Brooklyn the day before and taken a look at Miriam 's grave . " Oh my God , " he said , and then he was bending over again , cupping the salt solution in his palm and snuffling it up through his nostrils . Here was the man who had married my sister , I thought , whose name she had died with , died of maybe  --  Miriam on her wedding day with her black hair braided around her head in a wreath , Charlie in his Navy whites with a peeling sunburn on his nose and forehead . I could hear him spitting out into the sink , this man my sister had gone to bed with , as far as I knew the only man . I wondered if he had ever gone to bed with Mrs. Kling and hoped I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think I could take it , " he said . " I 'd rather just think about how she was when she was alive . " " Not me , " I said . " I like to think about how she is now she 's dead . " He said , " What makes you go and say a thing like that for , Tono ? " Maybe because he was the only man my sister ever got a chance to go to bed with . Maybe because Tony was his son . " I do n't know , " I said . " Do you ever think about being dead someday yourself , Charlie ? " " I guess I do , " he said . " I guess everybody thinks about it sometimes . " Some of the solution must have gotten trapped in his lousy sinuses and started to run out unexpectedly becausehe suddenly doubled over . When his face reappearedin the mirror , I said , " What do you think about when you think about being dead ? " Poor Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I try not to think about it any more than I have to . "  |p165I  said , " You should think about it . " " That 's morbid , " he said . " Do you think about it much yourself ? " I said , " I thought about it when we were all in the closet looking at your head lit up from the inside . I thought about it when what's-her-name told me I ought to paint my masterpiece out there . " " Why did you think about it then ? " Charlie said . " Because I decided maybe she was right , " I said . " Maybe I ought to paint it for the same reason they put lipstick on a corpse . " " What 's the matter with you ? " Charlie said . " You 're not even as old as I am . What are you anyway ? " " I 'm thirty-nine , " I said . " That 's nothing , " Charlie said . I said , " I did n't used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charlie said . " I 'm going on forty-seven . Thirty-nine is n't anything . " " It is n't sweet sixteen , " I said . " It is n't Tony , " at which I stood once again on the threshold of the door that Bebb urged the faithful to open . Charlie was rolling his sleeves back down again , having finished with his sinuses for the time being and also , I 'm sure he hoped , with our conversation . I could hear Mrs. Kling downstairstalking over long distance to Sharon and the sound of Bill crying . She 'd probably picked him up and was holding him clamped to her bust like a football . Tony I 'd said , naming his name . I might have said Sharon was n't the only one in that house he 'd screwed and then stood back and watched it start his sinuses running again . He 'd screwed me too , screwed me royally and maybe for keeps . I might have said I was planning to nail his balls to the wall.  |p166Charlie  said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all about what you 're going through , Tono . You ought to take a look at it . It 's quite an eye-opener . " He was standing in the bathroom door putting on his jacket . I said , " I 'm sure it is , Charlie , but right now I 'm up to my ears in The Call of the Wild . " " That 's Jack London , is n't it ? " Charlie said . I said , " Sigmund Freud . " Charlie 's lips were slightly parted , and his eyes had gone blank . He was testing to see if he could still feel the dry , cool spot at the back of his throat when he breathed in . " You ought to give The Middle Age Crisis a look-see , " he said . " I think it would do you good . " When Tony and Chris came drifting back , Charlie took them out to an early supper with Mrs. Kling . He asked Sharon and me to go too , but we used Bebb 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance at his morning services had n't picked up as he had predicted , and he thought if he added an old-fashioned prayer meeting at a different hour , he might attract a different crowd . Even if Charlie and Mrs. Kling had n't been there to spur us on , Sharon and I would probably have gone anyway just to swell the ranks . At the last one only about seven or eight had shown up including the woman with hair the color of raw meat who ever since the opening service had been one of his most faithful followers . She always brought Mickey with her . Mickey was the gerbil she carried around in a cage . He spent most of his time at church in the exercise wheel . It needed oiling.  |p167Sharon  and I arrived early to find Bebb and a policemanabout to sit down in the living room . We told Bebb we 'd wait on the porch , but he asked us to stay . The policeman asked the following questions . Full name : Lucille Yancey Bebb . Age : 57Place of birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bebb said , changing it then to auburn . Eyes : Bebb hesitated . I wondered if like me he 'd seen them so seldom because of black glasses that he could n't remember for sure . Hazel , he said . Any identifying marks : Bebb said no , then changed it to yes . It was his third slip in a row . The policeman looked up from his yellow pad . Bebb was sitting bolt upright facing him , and his trick eyelid chose this moment to do its trick . Sharon and I exchanged the second glance I 'd risked without words to use in case of an emergency . Bebb covered his face with his hands for a moment so that just the tip of his nose stuck out between them . Lucille had some scars on her wrists , he said , reappearing . He said it without a flicker . Had anybody noticed her indulging in peculiar behaviorlately , the policeman asked . Indulging was a policeman'sword , I thought : peculiarity was indulgence . Bebb 's eyelid alone was worth at least a friendly warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to Sharon and asked her . Sharon said , " Have you told him about the Tropicanas , Bip ? " She was sitting on the sofa beside him , and when she said it , I noticed her slip her little finger over his little finger on the cushion between them . Bip said , " My daughter here means sometimeswhen Mrs. Bebb 's low in her mind , she takes a little too much . " Alcohol ? the policeman asked , and Bebb said shep168mixed it with orange juice . Sharon said , " Do n't give out the recipe , Bip . " It did n't seem to help Bip much . When the policeman asked what he meant she was low in her mind , Bebb said , " We 're Southerners , officer . We 're a long ways from home . " It was one of his classical utterances , like All things are lawful for me and I believe everything . " We 're Southerners , " he said ; all three of them were . It was like a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known the truth it contained but that this was the first time I 'd ever heard it put into words . There seemed to be nothing it did n't explain : the poor attendance at Open Heart , the grim look on his face as the door of the freight elevator closed on him at Grand Central , all Sharon 's lessons . Maybe even Sharon and . . . but I had begun to develop a safety mechanism by then . As soon as my thoughts gave signs of turning the wrong way , it cut them off automatically . They were Southerners . They were a long ways from home . The policeman said he would let them know if anything turned up . The prayer meeting that followed was less than a success . Only about a dozen showed up including the red-haired woman and the blind man who had said he was a cousin of Harry Truman 's . The gerbil 's exercise wheel made it hard to concentrate on the praying , and it was obvious Bebb 's mind was n't on it either . The blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored . First we all prayed silently together . Then Bebb prayed out loud by himself . When it was over , the blind man jumped up and said , " Praise the Lord ! Hallelujah ! " but he ended up knocking down several empty chairs and tripped over his white cane . I do n't think Harry Truman would have been impressed.  |p169After  the service we asked Bebb to come back with us , but he thought he 'd better stay home in case anybody called . Sharon said she would stay with him . I could pick her up later . I left them sitting side by side on the porch steps . Sharon had her head on his shoulder . The sun was getting ready to set and had turned both their faces gold.  |p170WHEN  I got home , I went straight to my desk and took out the rolled-up sheets of flowered stationery that Lucillehad given me . They had apparently been written over a period of several months in different colored felttips . In some places they were quite difficult to read , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't make it any easier . Les tres riches heures de Lucille Bebb : Today I got bread , butter , bacon , baloney , beets . Brownie and Bebb . We should be living in Baton Rouge , Birmingham , Baltimore , Boca Raton , Buenos Aires , or Bethlehem , anyplace where they do n't have Indians . Ip171never minded nigger smell too much . It 's a lot of it just lemon juice . Indian smell is hair grease and dirty drawers . Bebb says Herman Redpath is n't long for this world but he does n't look that bad to me . Bea Trionka says half the kids he says are his are n't . They just let on they are to make him feel good . She says that part of him does n't even work any more , and she ought to know . Bebb must be slipping when it comes to laying on hands . Bebb went off to a meeting ( guess where ) and I sat by the fan and watched ' T V with the sound off . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant talking . The old woman was doing most of it , and you could tell she was making the young one mad the way she kept twisting up her napkin . Finally the young one could n't take it any more . She got in a couple of cracks and flounced out . The old woman did n't want to let her see she 'd made her cry , but soon as she left she got a handkerchief out of her bag and had a good one all by herself at the table . Sometimes it 's hard to know what people are talking about even when you can hear every damn word they say . Maybe Bebb was right . Herman Redpath was hanginghis legs into the pool . They looked like sticks of wood . He 's gone all yellow hollow ? . He looks Iike Papa did when it got into his glands and spread clear through him . I asked Bebb what does he think happens to people after they 're dead , and he said as many kind of things happen one side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him when Herman Redpath 's time comes be sure to tell me what happens to him and he says it 's not always given us to know but if it is he 'll letp172me know too . At supper he ate just the one frank and a bitty piece of lettuce . He 's worried what 's going to happenafter Herman Redpath 's gone , will we still have a roof over our heads and stuff and stuff . Who cares ? After Sharon come he never touched ? me again exceptonce in a while when it was like he could n't help himself and wanted to get it over with as quick as he could for both our sakes like puking . They all of them got to get rid of it someplace . God knows where he did all those years . I guess it kept building up in him all those years till the cork finally popped in Miami . When I asked him about it through the cage he told me what he . . . right in the eye . . . whispered like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing became indecipherableexcept for a few phrases because Lucille had scratched out most of it and there was also a bunch of violets in the way . One little girl put . . . he was havinghating ? the first . . . restaurant . . . lonesome . . . burning his hand husband ? Iike fire fury ? . . . Sharon . . . face himself again as long as . . . nobodyever . . . cellmate urinate ? ultimate ? The rest of the paragraph was blocked out entirely . I never saw him bare but only a few times in my whole life . He says you got to have something to hold onto . Here are the things I 've got to hold onto . I 've got every doorknobin the whole place , the draw handles , the flusher handle , the stair rail , the TV with green fuzz down one side of everybody 's face , and the Barcalounger and the Digest and my own teeth mostly and the ice box and the bed post when the room starts turning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair on the back ofp173it and soft inside like a powderpuff . And a closet full of junk and stuff and stuff . Shoes . He says store not up for thyself treasure where moth and rust and so forthHe says I 've got my good memories . Here are my good memories . I remember a Jack Homer pie made out of a hatbox and crape paper with different color strings comingout so when you pulled them it shot the pie all to hell but you ended up with a comb and lipstick set or a ring . I remember Sundays when we closed down Papa let me jerk any flavor I wanted so long as I did n't make myself sick and cleaned up the mess . I remember wakingup to the noon whistle and there was a letter from Sammy Jackson set on my water glass addressed just Little Miss Brighteyes , Clover Street . I remember Cora Bates 's fancy-dress . I remember Gloria Swanson , Doug Fairbanks , Norma Shearer , and Mickey Mouse . I remember the piano . I remember Sammy J. I remember Tweetybird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettingthe period , one . When we got out of Knoxville , two . When we got out of Armadillo , three . He says you got to have faith . Faith Murphy had the worst breath in school and ate nosepick . Talk about faith , when I saw the little weasened thing was n't movingany more I prayed I would be struck dead if that would make it move . They called him Blinky Bebb . He says he does n't have any control over that eye to this day or even knows when its cutting up and everybody has parts like that they do n't have any control over such as heartbeat , breathing , dreaming and so on and so forth . It 's all in the hands of God Almighty he says . I asked him did that mean hisp174eye was in the hands of God Almighty and he said that was a way of putting it . So its God Almighty winks Bebbs eye sometime and if so why ? If all those parts are in God 's hands I asked him what do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said sin right off . Just when he said it his eye cut up . I told him right then when you said sin your eye cut up . He said I know , can you blame it ? Dear Jesus , I am writing you this just in case . How come they called you Jesus of all the other names in Scripture ? They could of called you Matthew , Mark , Luke or John , they are names with some spunk to them . Jeeezzzus sounds like it had vaseline on it to make it slip in easy . I never liked my own name either . I use to say my name was EllicuI and I came from Grubnatraps . I was a virgin up to the day I married Bebb and for a spell afterwards just like Mary your mother . Lateron I killed my own baby , his name was Herman . Sometime I go for days without once thinking about it . Bebb went and got him a swingset even tho he was n't but a few months old the day he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Bebb set it up in the yard . Sometimes the breeze clanked the swing around . Once I put my finger in the crack of the door where the hinges are . What happened was the fingernail turned black and after a while it dropped off . I told Bebb it was a accident . Bebb says underneath are the everlasting arms . He says surely he bath born our griefs and carried our sorrows . He says we are all washed clean in the Blood of thep175Lamb and so on and so forth . One time what I said to him was Bebb , the only thing I 've been washed in is the shit of the horse . You know what he did ? He took the very same finger the nail fell off of only that was years before and I told him it was a accident , and he kissed it . That was when I first thought maybe he was from Outer Space . Mr. Jesus , is that where you are from too ? Love , Ellicul of Grubnatraps . P.s . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who is the fat man keeps hanging around Holy Love ? They would n't let the undertaker take Herman Redpaththo Bebb says theirs a law . They must of got around it somehow . They did it all themselves . Bea Trionka was n't there , just the men , but Johnson Badger told her what they did . Some of it anyway . They put salt on his tongue and up his nostrils and ears and up his rear end . They painted red and blue designs on his chest , red for the earth and blue for the sky . They buttered his legs . They put moccasins on his feet . They hung an apron on him to cover his private parts . The apron was black to remind him he was n't to use anything down there till he got where he was going . After they had him in his brown suit they put in his pockets : a box of Sun Maid Raisins , a jacknife , leather bootlaces , a deerskin pouch , some strings of beads , a whistle , a birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to her Bea what do you Indians believe about after a persons dead ? She said we do n't have to believe anything because what you folksp176have to believe , we know . She 's like all the rest of them . Its supposed to be a big honor to keep the flies off Herman Redpath . I guess for flies its a big honor to lay your eggs on him . I said I ca n't do it because Antonio is here and we got to have heap big family powwow . Bebb tries to make out like he does n't mind Sharon is n't here too . I woke up and there was Bebb setting in the rocker by the window rocking in the moonlight , he had n't even taken his tie and jacket off . When he saw I was awake he started talking . I never saw him so wound up , he must have talked half the night . Part of the time I listenedand part of the time I dropped off . It did n't make a partical of difference to him which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was talking to himself or Jesus or whoever he talks to in the night . He talked about the funeral and the hundred thousand and where we 're going to go to next and the big things we 're going to do when we get there . He talked about Holy Love what 's going to happen to it and can Brownie handle things by himself and so on and so forth . After a while I must have dropped off again because the next thing I knew he was talking about something different and he was talking in a different way , slower , like he was reading fine print or telling something he was watching happen out the window while he was telling it but could n't see too good . He was telling what happened to Herman Redpath after he was dead . To Whom It May Concern . This is a true account of what Leo Bebb told on the night after Herman Redpath'sfuneral . He was cold sober and I was sober too itp177being something like three o'clock A.M. As near as I can remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman Redpath took off his brown suit and set it down beside him where an eagle come and carried it off in his beak to make stars out of it in the sky like the Big Dipper but not stars that will be visible from this planet for a long time to come if ever . Before he took his suit off Herman Redpath put the things he had in the pocketsinto the deerskin pouch and hung it around his neck with one of the bootlaces . It was cold but the butter on his legs helped keep him warm . The moccasins helped too . Nobody is sure how old Herman Redpath was when he died but he must have taken off a few years when he took off his brown suit because if he was n't a young man yet he was n't an old man anymore either . The flesh did n't hang on him like laundry . He did n't have liver spots or breathe through his teeth . He could dogtrot . He dogtrotted against the wind because that was the direction the eagle flew off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide prairie stretching on and on as far as the eye could see and flat and hard as a paving stone . It was n't day and it was n't night and the color of the sky was n't all that different from the color of the ground which was nothing but scrub and rocks . He could hear his moccasins pounding on it chunk chunk except on the pebbly parts chicka chicka like a rattle , it was the only sounds he could hear because it was all there was , not a snake or a bird or a four-footed creature . He was alone . Till he come up to a big bolder the size of a phonebooth . Out from behind that bolder raging and screaming there suddenly jumped out a creature was part snake , part bird , part four footed creature and then some . Itp178had its face where its hindparts should have been and it had its hindparts where its face should have been and when it opened any part of itself up you could n't tell what part it was opening or what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opened . It come tearing full speed at Herman Red path flapping all the things it had would flap and making the kind of noise a bird would make if it was a snake . Its eyes were rolling around under its tail something wicked and it was hung all over with damp whiskery things where its eyes ought to been . It howled like a coyote would howl if it was a blackwidow spider , and when it saw Herman Redpath was n't going to cut loose and run it lept on him . It Iept on him the way a Royal Bengal Tiger would leap if it was a swarm of maggots . It knocked him to the ground . Herman Red path could feel there was something hot and feathery tightning up around his throat from one direction and something icecold and scaley tightning up around it from another direction and down from above something was coming right for him that looked like a concertina and smelled like sewer gas . The mouth of Merman Redpath was chock full of tongue . His eyes were shooting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in all the world . That hope was his deerskin pouch . The deerskin pouch had got tore off his neck in the scuffle and was laying next him on the ground , the way his neck was twisted he could just see it . Between his hand and the pouch was maybe about 6 inches . The only transportation the hand had was three fingers , two of them having got broke in the fight already , so that hand started in to crawling after the pouch on its three fingers like a roach thats been part stepped on . Some/how that hand made it . Somehow those fingers wrapped themselves around that jacknife and got it open . No clock could measure the kind of time it took , but finally Herman Redpath got so he had raised the jacknife high enough to where it was pointing right down over something the like of a poach egg that grew between what you might have called the creatures sholderblades if it had 've had sholders . Not a moment too soon Herman Redpath used up the last ounce of strenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smack into the middle of the poach egg . The sound it made was the sound a blownup balloon makes when you let it go without tyingthe end off . Herman Redpath got up . He fixed the deerskin pouch around his neck with another bootlace and took off again . The ground begun to rise after a while and soon he was drogtrotting up hill . The higher up hill he went , the colder it got . The wind blew harder . He was glad for the butter on his legs . Even the small black apron was some comfort . The wind kept blowing it up against his stomack and when he reached down to see could he make it stay put , he accidently touched something he had n't touched anything like for many a year . It was n't an old dishmop hanging there anymore . It was a bunch of Concord grapes . By and by he come to a teepee . There was smoke coming out of a hole in the top and the flap was pinned open . He thought if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to keep going up to the top of the mountain . He crawled in through the opening , and up near the fire laying on a pile of soft animal skins he saw a woman . She was a young woman with black braids down far as her knees . Like King Solomon saidp180about the Queen of Sheba , her lips were like a thread of scarlet and her breasts like two young roes which feed among the lillys and her belly a heap of wheat . This woman she welcomed Herman Redpath and told him to come sit down where it was nice and warm . She made a poltice of herbs and dressed the wounds the creature had left on him . She bound up his broken fingers . She offered him meat and drink only he did n't take any of it because something told him he better not . When all this was done , she reached up her arms and showed him how he was to lay down side of her there on the animal skins . She undid the deerskin pouch he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo the black apron too but before she could undo it , Herman Redpathsaw if he was once to lay down with her there next the fire , he would never get up again and he would never make it to the place where he was going . So he reached down into the pouch and pulled out the strings of beads instead . She put one string around her neck and wound the other string into her black hair . Then she commencedmaking signs at him made him know for sure if he stayed he was a goner . So he took the crisp new ten dollar bills he had in the pouch and handed them over to her too . While she was busy spreading them out by the fire to see how many of them there was he 'd gave her , he tied the pouch back on his neck again and took off out of there like greased lightning . It was a long way to the top of that mountain . He wished he had n't been so careful about not touching the food the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisins into his mouth and they took some of the edge off . There was times he thought he heard the voice of the woman hollering sentimental things after him , butp181he did n't look back once . It might have been the wind . His feet felt heavier and heavier as the ground got steeper . The poltice the woman rubbed on his sore places had set in to itching and burning some . But finally he got to the top and when he got there it seemed like maybe this was the place he was going to settle down and spend the rest of forever in . Why everything Herman Redpath had ever wanted and had n't got was there . Everything he 'd ever lost and thought he 'd never find again was there . All the good times he 'd ever had was happening there at the same time and some of the good times he 'd never gotten around to having , they were happening there too . There was n't a person he 'd ever given a hoot about that was n't some way there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . To set a extra place for him at the table . To laugh and cry with him . To bear his children . To put up with his cussedness . To remember back with him like they 'd been there themselves all the best things he could remember out of his whole life clear back to Betty Shortleg with her breath that smelled of apples how she squirted sassparilla at him through the gap in her teeth , back to his greatgrandad showing him the way it was Tecumseh had stood up better than 7 foot tall at Fort Meig with his arms stretched out like eaglewings . All these things and then some were on top of the mountain with Herman Redpath . They were in his ears the way the sound of the sea is in seashells . They were in his eyes the way seashells are at the bottom of the sea . These things were happening alright except the place they were happening in was no place except right there inside Herman Redpath 's own head . Herman Redpath was alone.  |p182Herman  Redpath stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron to cover his nakedness and the deerskin pouch tied around his neck , and there was n't a solitary thing you could say was truely happeninganywhere nearer than a million miles except what was happening on the inside of Herman Redpath . But he had a hunch if he just hung around there awhile , it would all start happening trudy on the outside too , all the good dreams of his life corning true together and every last one of the best times he could remember out of his life coming back to life again . He squatted down on his heels with his knuckles on the ground in front of him . He started in taking deep breaths . Then he felt something bumping him on his chest . It was the deerskinpouch . He opened it up to find out what was in it to make it bump so , and out flew the birds wing . It spun around over his head three times like it was tied to a cowboy rope . Then it took off down into the canyon ahead . Herman Red path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he to spend the rest of forever on that mountain the only thing he 'd ever find there was ghosts . This was the worst time yet . The mountain face was steep something cruel on the far side . It was so steep when the stones gave way under his feet he 'd slip and slide with the muscles in his legs tensing up in a shaky way that made him feel foolish and ashamed . It was n't getting darker but the air was getting thicker and harder to see through . He could n't see the horizon anymore . Soon he could n't see the ground underneath his own feet even , and the only way he knew it was so steep was from slipping and sliding . It got warmer as he went down . After a bit the temperature of the air got to bep183exactly the same as the temperature of his body and stopped right there . From the time that happened he could n't feel his skin anymore . It was like either he did n't have skin anymore , or the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground stopped being hard . It felt like he was walking in cake flour . He could n't hear his feet anymore or hardly feel them . He could n't feel or hear anything else anymore either . Plus he could n't see anything the air being so thick and tepid . It seemed like because he did n't have any skin anymore he did n't have any shape either or any boundaries . He had a feeling his legs were still working but he was n't sure he was moving . He could have been just hanging in the air on the end of a string . Herman Redpath knew the place he was was noplace . He knew the place where he was going was nowhere . And he knew even if there was a way to get from noplaceto nowhere there was n't hardly anything left of him solid enough to get there with . He could n't think of anything left in the deerskin pouch could help him now , and he was just as glad . It was n't all that bad being without shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't anyplace in particular . The other way of looking at it you were everyplace in general . Both ways had there good points . He could n't even have told you his name if you 'd asked him , and he did n't care a pin . He did n't care if he never got to the place he was supposedto get and if you 'd have told him there was n't any such place , he would n't have cared a pin about that either . It was very restful . Then Herman Red path smelled something . It was a smell half way between peanuts and seaweed . It was a private , historical kind of smell . He could n't hear or seep184or feel anything , and there was n't anything around to know if he could taste it or not . But he could smell . And he figured out what he smelled must be his own smell because there was n't so much as the ghost of anything else it could be the smell of . By smelling it he got his nose back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the smell was . It was a smell left over from the time the Joking Cousin had taken a leak on him . There was n't a doubt in the world but what the smell he was smelling deep down in that canyon was the smell of John Turtle 's piss . Herman Redpath grabbed ahold of that piss smell and pulled himself back into his skin with it like it was a rope . He pulled himself back into a boundary and shape with it . He pulled himself up the other side of the miserable canyon with it . By the time he got up there he could feel the ground solid under his feet again . He could hear the chunk-chunk of his moccasins . It was n't anything in his deerskin pouch that had saved him this time . It was the piss of that crazy John Turtle . He thought well you never know , and thanked John Turtle in his heart . The air had thinned out so he could see again . The only trouble was the thing he saw was n't encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall of a oldtime stockade . It was a wall made of upright peeled logs pegged together so tight there was n't a crack you could have squeezed so much as the queen of spades through . It was high as the Houston Astrodome and it stretched out to right and left as far as the eye could see . There was just one small doorway through it . In the middle of the doorway there was an old man squatting on his hunkers . His hair was white and hung down hisp185front in two braids . His face was cracked and rutted like a 8 week drought . It took him a few minutes before Herman Redpath recognized the old man was his own greatgrandad the same that had shown him how Tecumsehheld his arms out at Fort Meig . This greatgrandad had also been a friend of Tecumseh 's brother Tensquatawathe Shawnee Prophet . Herman Redpath raised his right hand to the old man and the old man raised his . The old man said You smell ' like you been dawbing yourself all over with peanuts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to him about John Turtle . He squatted down on his hunkerslike his greatgrandad and they stayed face to face that way chewing the fat for a long time . Herman Redpathdid most of the talking but the talk come out with breaks in between the different parts of it for his greatgrandadto get in his a  --  worth if he felt like it , and there was n't half as much cussing and shameful language in it as there was toward the end of his days on earth when he was too old and wore out to care what folks thought . When they finished chewing the fat Herman Redpath stood up and raised his right hand again but this time the old man did n't raise his right hand back . He did n't show any sign of moving out of the doorway to let Herman Redpath through either . Herman Redpath could guess what would happen if he tried tangling there with his own greatgrandad who had Tecumseh and Tensquatawa both for a friend so he asked him polite as you please would he mind moving off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man stood up . There was a lot of rattling , jingling noises when he did it because he was hung all over with wampumand teeth and dried up things that probably he wasp186the only one could give a name to . He was a good head higher than Herman Redpath , and never mind how old his face looked , he had the build of a man in his prime . When he was up , he filled the doorway . When he spread his legs and put his hands out to the sides , he filled it some more . The old man said to Herman Redpath , Son , before I can let you pass on through you got to tell me two words , one for the earth and one for the sky . Its the rule of the place . The only thing that Herman Redpath had that was left in his deerskin pouch was the whistle so he took it out and gave two loud whistles on it . The old man did n't budge an inch . He just scrunched up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears hurt . So Herman Redpath tried some pairs of words on him . First he would try a word for the earth and then he would try a word for the sky just like his greatgrandad told him . He tried Fire and Water . He tried Here and There . He tried Bad and Good . He tried Wolf and Eagle and Thick and Thin . He made up some names like Ompom-pooand Forp and . tried them . When Death and Life did n't work he turned it around and tried Life and Death . He tried some long Indian words he had n't thought of for years like **67;13544;TOOLONG **57;13613;TOOLONG . But after the first few pairs of words , the old man did n't even bother to shake his head anymore . Poor Herman Redpath . He had come such a long way . He had run into so many kinds of danger and was still so sore in most of the places where the creature hadp187mawled him . He thought of the kind of thing he might have been doing now if only he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had invited him to . He thought of the top of the mountain and Betty Shortleg and all the lost things he would of gotten such a kick out of finding again even if all they were was ghosts . He thought how peaceful it was in that canyon where the air was warm as his own spit and it was like he did n't have any skin . And now his greatgrandad would n't let him through the wall . It made him so mad he thought of trying some bad words just for the spite of it . He thought of trying words like Shit and Fuck and Turd and Fart only he just did n't have the energy . He felt that helpless , all he could do was hang his head and look at the ground . He looked at his moccasins . He looked at his buttery shins . He looked at the black apron . He looked at his belly that did n't sag anymore like an awning full of rainwater but was flat and hard as a washboard . Next thing he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and blue designs , red for the earth and blue for the sky . The red design was the Indian way of setting down the word for the earth , and the blue design that curled in and out of it like a snake was the Indian way of settingdown the word for the sky . The words themselves were too powerful to say outloud so Herman Redpath did them in sign language instead . The sign for the word for the earth was to get down on your hands and knees and press your two lips on the packed yellow dirt where he and his greatgrandad had been squatting while they chewed the fat . So he got down on his hands and knees and did that . The sign for the word for the sky was to uncover yourp188nakedness , throw back your head and reach your arms up as high as they would reach and then a little higher . So he took off the black apron that was tied around him and did that . The old man winked one eye and stepped aside . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eye , Herman Redpath thought of a person he had known back on earth in the old days . He did n't think of him by name because he 'd forgotten his name and he did n't think of him by looks or by any feeling he used to have about him in the days when they knew each other because he 'd forgotten all that too . The only way he could think of him was by two words which he 'd seen written up someplace crisscross with one 0 in the middle to make do for them both  --  HOLY stretched out crossways and LOVE running straight down through it . He thought if ever he run into that person again somedaywhere he was going , as did n't seem likely , he would tell him that the word HOLY was a moth-eaten pale-face way of saying the sign for the earth , and the word LOVE was a flea-bitten pale-face way of saying the sign for the sky . It took Herman Red path less than a second and a half to think all this . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody 's business . He was naked as the day he was born . If his greatgrandad had n't moved out of the way in time , the old man would have been skewered . So that 's how it was Herman Redpath come to the Happy Hunting Ground . What it was like when he got there and what he saw and what he did , all those things are n't given us to know for now . The only thing that is known about what happened beyond the door in thep189wall is that Herman Redpath never did find out what the whistle was for . But he kept it tied around his neck in the deerskin pouch just to be on the safe side . I believe Leo Bebb truly saw all this with his own eyes . It may be he was seeing it right then while he was rocking in his chair in the moonlight telling me about it . I believe Leo Bebb knows more than he lets on about many many things like for instance about Mr. Fatass Golden . I believe Leo Bebb is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? At the bottom of the last page , one word in each of the five petals of a daisy , Lucille had written in tinyletters MY ONLY FRIEND IS BROWNIE.  |p190THE  MESSAGE of the daisy petals led me to put in a long-distance call to Brownie immediately . As soon as he answered , I told him about Lucille . I told him she 'd left no clues behind and that so far the police had n't turned up any . I told him I was calling in hopes that maybe she had gotten in touch with him . Maybe he could give us a lead . I did n't mention Les tres riches heures . Brownie said , " These are the times that try men 's souls , dear . I just do n't know what to say . I wish there was something I could do to help . " I said , " Brownie , did she ever let anything drop to you that might give us a clue where she 's gone ? Has she called you up or written you the last couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known each other a good many years now and we 've been through thick and thin together , but we 've never been the kind of friends that exchange phone calls and letters . We were never close in that way . " I said , " I happen to know she considered you one of her best friends , Brownie . Considers you . " " That is correct , dear , " Brownie said . " There 's no call to use the past tense . I am sure wherever she 's gone and whatever reason she had for going there , she 's alive and well . You 've got to have faith . " I said , " I 'm afraid Bip 's desperate . " Brownie said , " He would n't ever have gone to the policeif he was n't desperate . You 're going to have to help him , clear . " " I wish I could , " I said . Brownie said , " You can help him by telling him you know she 's all right . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brownie . " Brownie said , " Tell him thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day because thou bast made the Lord thy habitation . " I said , " I do n't think even Scripture would cut much ice with him at this point . " Brownie said , " Then tell him Brownie says he has n't got anything to be worried about . " I could n't be sure it was n't my imagination , but it seemed to me that Brownie had lowered his voice slightly . I said , " Do you know something you 're not letting on , Brownie ? " There was a silence at Brownie 's end . Generally I ca n't stand telephone silences and will babble any inanityp192to end them , but I gritted my teeth and made myself sit this one out in the hope that it would eventually force Brownie into giving some kind of answer . Finally he said , " We are all of us seeking a homeland , dear , even though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all of us strangers and pilgrims on the earth . " I said , " That 's not answering my question , Brownie . " " I wish I could lend you a helping hand , " Browniesaid . " Bear ye one another 's burdens  --  that 's what we'reall put here for . " More and more it was like talking to a book of Biblical quotations , but I decided to try once more . I said , " For Christ sake , Brownie , is Lucille down there with you or what ? Let 's cut out Scripture . " Again Brownie paused . Then he said , " Maybe you 'd think better of Scripture if you 'd read it clear through to the end . The end of Scripture is Revelation , dear . " " Revelation , " I said . " And the most important part of Revelation , " Brownie said , " is the last part . " " The very last part ? " I said . Brownie said , " Give or take a few words , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " I said . Brownie said , " You be sure to do that , " and with a sigh of relief that was audible all the way from Texas , he said goodbye and hung up . It was not the first time in my experience that Brownie had tried to communicate with me in Biblical cipher , and I lost no time looking up his reference to Revelation . I was primarily interested , of course , in whatever Brownie was trying to tell me but I was interested too in finding out how the Bible ended . My sporadic readings hadp193never happened to include the last page . It was the first time I 'd ever thought of the Bible 's actually having a last page , of there being after all those thousands of words one final word . The Bible I found was a Gideon that must have been in the house when we first moved in . The black binding had gone rusty and was starting to wear thin around the corners . Placed in this Hotel by the G EONS was stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circular stain . I pictured some drummer in stocking feet using it as a coaster . Inside , the text was littered with letters of the alphabet to mark footnotes . There were hyphens and diacritical marks to indicate the pronunciation of proper names . Every once in a while an innocuous word like and or is or the would be printed in italics . Reading it was like listening to somebody with a bad stutter . " The grace of our Lord Je ' - sus Christ be with you all . A-men ' was the last verse , but Brownie 's " Give or take a few words , dear " led me back to the next to last . Twitching and stammering , it went " He which testifieth these things saith , ' Surely I come quickly . ' A-men ' . ' Even so , come , Lord Je-sus . " There could be no mistaking Brownie 's message , I thought . He must know something he could n't say over the phone . Maybe Lucille herself had been in the room as he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Maybe he thought the operator was listening . In any case , whatever Brownie knew , it could apparently be found out only by going to Texas to find it . There was no time to lose . Come was obviously what Brownie was saying . Come quickly . Come , dear  --  come whoever cared enough to find out the truth . Bebb . Me . But the name in the book was Je ' - sus , Saint John thep194Divine or whoever it was that wrote Revelations getting stuck on that first syllable so that with his eyes rolled upand his chin bobbing it kept coming out Je ' , Je ' , Je ' , Je ' , until finally the blessed relief of sus . Come , Lord Jesus , Maybe that was Brownie 's message too , I thought : that the only one whose coming would make any difference in the long run was Jesus . Je'sus hopping the plane to Houston . Je ' - sus at the Red Path Ranch . Je ' - sus knocking at the door to have Brownie open it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and Je ' - sus would sit down over a couple of Tropicanas , her life-blood . Drink up . She would tell Je ' - sus she never cared for his name . Je ' - sus would tell her to take off her black glasses . I had made the call upstairs in our bedroom , and when I hung up , I sat there on our bed with the Gideon Bible open on my knees . I 'd told Sharon I 'd come back and pick her up at Bebb 's . I had Brownie 's message to deliver . It was getting late . But I could n't move for some reason , just sat there staring at the dreary , doublecolumnedpage as though exhausted already by the long journey I knew would begin the moment I sat up and started downstairs . Come quickly . It was the urgency of the thing that paralyzed me . I knew I should do something right away , but I could n't get going . I felt like lying down on the bed  --  Sharon 's and my bed . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was something else I should probablydo something about , I thought , though God only knew what . Talk it out with one of them maybe , maybe with both of them  --  work it through , work it off . Teach school with it . Lear 's lines drifted through my mind , " We two alone will sing like birds i ' the cage. /Whenp195thou dost ask me blessing , I 'll kneel down/And ask of thee forgiveness . " All three of us kneeling down somewhere , asking of each other something . Come quickly . But for the time being it was more than I could swing . I might even have actually lain down there , shut my eyes on the whole clamoring snarl of things , but then I heard a car drive in . I heard the unmistakable voice of Mrs. Kling . She and Charlie were bringing the boys back from supper . I beat it out down the back stairs . I rolled out of the driveway as quietly as I could with the headlights off and drove straight to Bebb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room watching TV , their faces the color of moonlight . I did n't tell them about Lucille 's tres riches heures . I did n't ask Bebb if it was true that he 'd told her the story of how Herman Redpathreached the Happy Hunting Ground and if so , how he 'd come to know about it . I just reported my conversation with Brownie and quoted from memory the next to last verse of the Book of Revelation . Bebb said , " Antonio , there is n't a doubt in my mind but what she 's back in Houston and Brownie 's telling us to get our tails down there pronto . He could n't say it straight out for fear she 'd get wind of it . " Sharon said , " Why did she go , Bip ? " On the TV screen there was a short man in a tuxedo and a fat woman in a sequined evening dress standing in front of a microphone . Somebody came in pushing a wheelbarrow . The laughter crackled like a bonfire , and Bebb got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe she went to see would we come after her . " " Are you ? " Sharon said . Bebb said , " Honey , I do n't just know what I 'm goingp196to do . " He was still standing by the TV . The fat woman had turned her back to the short man in the tuxedo . He unzipped her dress and helped her pull it off over her head . Underneath she was wearing overalls . Bebb said , " For many years Lucille has n't what you might say moved . She has set around watching TV and drinking Tropicanas . She has been there when you went out , and when you come back in later , she was right there still . I do n't mean she has n't kept moving in her own way . There 's no telling how many miles a day a a woman travels just doing her chores . I mean she has n't moved inside herself . She has n't gotten anywheres or even wanted to . For a long time Lucille Yancey Bebb has been stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw cracking the words out one by one . He was staring down at the carpet , his eyes catching the silvery light of the TV like soap bubbles , pearls . He could have been seeing Lucille herself as he talked about her just the way he could have been seeing Herman Redpath that night as he had talked to Lucille about him : Herman Redpath jogging along with the deerskin pouch around his neck ; Lucille stuck year after year behind those black glasses or Lucille wherever she was now , moving wherever she was moving . Behind Bebb I could see that the fat woman in the overalls had gotten the short man into the wheelbarrow and was wheeling him in it across the stage . Bebb said , " Well , at last she 's taken off . It could be a good thing or a bad thing , depending . Say she 's gone back to Houston . Then why 'd she go there ? To get away from something here ? To find something there ? Brownie maybe . She always took to Brownie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring her back . On the other hand it might be just the wrong thing . "  |p197I  said , " There did n't seem to be any doubt in Brownie'smind anyway . " Bebb said , " Antonio , Brownie 's an old woman . Always was and always will be . He 'd say you do n't take chances no matter what . Brownie 'd say as long as Lucille stays put , at least you know where she 's at . That 's playing it safe . You take Brownie himself . He 's played it so safe all his life he 's never lived . He 's slid his life in under his tail and sat on it . The man 's got spiritual hemorrhoids . " Bebb was working one arm up and down as he spoke . He said , " Because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth . Antonio , life is a gamble . If you do n't take chances , you 're not alive . I promised Lucille Yancey to honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe that means I should go down and fetch her back now before she goes off the deep end . But maybe not . Maybe I honor her most by leaving her go . " Sharon said , " You better do like Brownie says and bring her back , Bip . If anything happens to her , you 'll never forgive yourself . " Bebb said , " Suppose nothing happens to her ever again . Can I forgive myself that ? " Bebb switched on the overhead lights and turned off the TV . A young woman holding a different type of denture cleanser in each hand was sucked up into a small bright hole in the middle of the screen and then disappeared . On the plane to Houston the next morning , Bebb the great gambler , the great believer , was sick . He did it neatly into a paper cup . When he was finished , I could see the tears rolling down his cheeks . He said , " Every time I puke , I cry . I ca n't help it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid . "  |p198WE  DID N'T LET Brownie know we were coming for fear that if Lucille was down there with him as we suspected and got wind we were on our way , she might clear out beforewe arrived . We took a taxi from the Houston airportand had it let us off at Holy Love , where Brownie 's office was . The church was open , but we could n't find Brownie or anybody else . The office looked much as it had when it was Bebb 's except that on the wall behind the desk Brownie had hung a much enlarged photograph of Bebb and Herman Redpath that must have been taken not long before Herman Redpath 's death . It showed Herman Redpath sitting in a wicker armchair on the lawn in frontp199of Holy Love looking a good deal like John D. Rockefellerin his old age . His bony hands hung down over the ends of the chair-arms as if somebody else had arranged them there . The toes of his high-button shoes pointed slightly in toward each other . He was in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him in his preaching robe with his hands on the old man 's shoulders . His head was directly above Herman Redpath'shead , and they were both staring into the camera . They looked like some kind of totem pole . ' We had already let the taxi go , so after failing to find Brownie and not wanting to spread word of our arrival by a phone call , we decided to head off for the residential compound on foot . Holy Love was on the fringes of the ranch , so there were several miles of flat , dusty road ahead of us . We had brought a single overnight bag between us which I carried . Bebb had loosened his collar and tie and knotted a handkerchief around his neck to catch the sweat . To keep the sun off his bald head , he put on a Mexican sombrero which he 'd found hanging in the corridor outside Brownie 's office . It made him look like part of a nightclub act . When we came in sight of the stables , some barefoot children ran down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bebb 's sombrero apparently kept them from recognizing him , and he made no attempt to identify himself . I 'm not sure he even noticed them . His face looked grim and pale under the jouncing straw brim as he trudged along . He had fastened the drawstring to keep the sombrero on , and the string-ends hung down in a tassel from his knob of a chin . The only time he spoke was when we passed a low cinder-block building where there was a flagpole out front with a flag at half-mast . Bebb pointedp200to it and said , " Herman Redpath is gone , Antonio , but he is not forgotten . " Except for the children we saw no signs of life until we got as far as the greenhouse . A pickup truck was just pulling out of the drive with pails of cut flowers in the back  --  white iris , white carnations , long-stemmed roses , and some shaggy yellow species that I did n't recognize . The truck stopped under a tree , and from the shadows of the cab a bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , " Hiya , good-lookin ' . " Pushing the sombrero back off his forehead , Bebb stopped to watch the driver get out and run across the road to us . I recognized him immediatelyas John Turtle . He threw his arms around Bebb and hugged him . He said , " Oh Leo , we been missing you real bad down here . Things are n't the same with you gone anyhow . " Bebb said , " I 've had spells of missing you too , John Turtle . " " That 's real good , " John Turtle said , " the way we both been missing each other , me and you . " " That 's friendship for you , " Bebb said . John Turtle was looking at Bebb , but he reached out sideways and poked me in the stomach with his finger . He said , " How you doing , friendship ? Gettin ' much lately ? " His gold-framed teeth glinted in the Texas sun . I said , " How about yourself , John Turtle ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bebb said , " Boys , if I do n't get out of this sun for a minute , you 're going to find yourself talking with a pool of grease . " Sweat was running down from under the sombreroand had soaked through the armpits of his Palm Beach cloth suit . John Turtle said , " Come on over to the truck and takep201a load off your feet . Tell me all the things that 's been happening anyhow . " " You too , " Bebb said . " Tell me what 's going on down here , John Turtle . " John Turtle had parked his pickup in the shade . He lowered the tailgate , and the three of us sat down on it with John Turtle in the middle and our feet dangling just off the ground . I have never smelled a body-smell to equal John Turtle 's . It was a fourth presence there on the tailgate . If it had been music , it would have taken the Houston Symphony to do it justice . " So tell me what 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say , " Tell me if my wife 's here , " did n't even mentionher . John Turtle did n't mention her either . They neither of them spoke Lucille 's name as we sat there on the tailgate with all those flowers , and yet I had the feelingthat it was Lucille they were speaking about the whole time anyway . Their conversation was like one of those trick pictures in which , once you look at it the right way , you discover that the empty space among the trees is really a human face . John Turtle told Bebb what was new with a number of Indians . He said , " That oldest boy of Harry Hocktaw 's , he got caught in the sauna bath playing ring-around-therosywith Louemma Pole . I 'm telling you there was some awful boo-hoo when all them Poles and Hocktaws got together on it after . I come too . Oh my yes . We work it all out , do n't you worry . Harry Hocktaw 's boy gon na have him a nice little wife anyhow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . Louemma Pole , she gon na have a snake in her grass to the end of her born days . " He said , " The day old Maudie Redpath turned a
