FEDERAL JUDGE Prentice Marshall authorized Friday the promotion of 117 Chicago policemen to the rank of sergeant after a city lawyer said the promotion list complies with a quota system the fudge devised two years ago . In . a 1976 ruling , Marshall ordered that 40 per cent of the policemen promoted must be women or members of minority groups . Consequently , 70 of the new sergeants would be white males , and 47 would be women or members of racial or ethnic minorities . All those promoted were chosen front the hotly debated 1973 police sergeant 's eligibility list , labeled discriminatory by minority groups and by Marshall . After Marshall approved the promotions , Earl Neal , special assistant city corporation counsel , asked for permission to invalidate the 1973 list and schedule another sergeant 's examination for Sept. 16 .
