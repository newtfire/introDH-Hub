Few people appreciate the promise and the peril of the fast-growing natural-foods business as well as Irwin Simon , the energetic founder and CEO of the Hain Celestial Group . In the decade or so that Simon , 46 , has been cobbling together the niche category 's leader by buying up dozens of mom-and-pop brands , he has had to deal with all sorts of situations that are n't typically covered in business school . During one of Hain 's recent acquisitions , the seller tried to insist that his factories be closed on Saturdays for religious reasons . Then there was the time not long ago when Simon discovered that a firm Hain Celestial Group had just purchased had absolutely no workers ' compensation insurance . And soon after Hain made its biggest acquisition ever , shelling out more than $300 million for herbal-tea pioneer Celestial Seasonings in 2000 , Simon had to get used to the idea that employees there sometimes came to work in sandals and shorts . <P> True to its grass-roots heritage , the fledgling , fragmented health-food industry has always attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company records in shoeboxes and did n't worry too much about profits , marketing or even good taste . Without necessarily having to lose the unique , even quirky , flavor that has contributed to much of the industry 's appeal over the years , Simon thinks he can take natural foods to the next level . By bringing together a top-notch management team with some of the best brands in the field  --  from WestSoy soy milk and Celestial Seasonings teas to Terra and Garden of Eatin ' chips , Health Valley cereals and soups and Earth 's Best baby foods  --  Simon believes healthy food can attain the kind of healthy bottom line enjoyed by its more mainstream cousins . <P> Though a mere fraction of the retail food pie 's more than $500 billion-a-year total , natural foods ' estimated $16 billion in annual sales is one of the few bright spots in a generally flat industry . Spurred by the soaring popularity of such natural retailers as Whole Foods and Wild Oats and expanded natural sections at the likes of Kroger and Safeway , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing at 5% to 10% a year , and they could claim 10% of the entire food universe within a decade . " I do n't think natural and organic food is a fad . It 's a way of life , " says Simon , a fast-talking native of Nova Scotia , Canada , who started his career in the U.S. by expanding H ? ? agen-Dazs ' chain of ice cream shops in the 1980s . " And no major food company is built for the 21st century . "
