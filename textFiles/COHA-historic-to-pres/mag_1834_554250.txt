THIs book was thought important enough to justify a formal vote of the Massachusetts Historical Society , requesting its publication , and a subsequent subscription for five hundred copies in this quarter , without which the editor hesitated to proceed . It seems , however , to have attracted but little attention , except from the few , who are curious in antiquities , while book-making speculations from superficial observers of our manners and public institutions are sought for with a kind of passion . To complain of this , or to inquire for its causes , is not our present purpose . In literary , as in political affairs , there is no appeal from the decision of the public . But we may be allowed , at least , to recommend a different taste , by introducing to notice from time to time such British works , as , with apparently greater value , have from some caL1*e fa ed of proportionate success . The title page , as given above , is not the one which is found in the copies transmitted to subscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Preface of ten or more pages are also wanting . The editor probably thought that something might be necessary to recommend the work to notice at home , which would appear altogether superfluous here . The // omission is not material : yet we regret it , because the preface contains the evidence of the liberality that gave the impulse to the publication , and still more , because it gives a few hints respecting the author ; the more valuable , as the promise of a separate biographical work contained in it , has not been and from the lapse of time seems not likely to be fulfilled . The story of Thomas Hutchinson 's life carries its moral with it ,  --  apart from being another memorable example of the folly of the best grounded human expectations . Sprung from a respected family in the Province , and passing creditably through his youth , he issued from Harvard University at the early age of sixteen , to enter at once into the active pursuits of life . His first object seems to have been wealth , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering expectation , he turned his attention to other pursuits . He became a politician , and a student of colonial records . The confidence of this fellow citizens was earned by the excellence of his private character , and by the sober manner in which he conducted himself in all his social relations . In the year 1737 , * at twenty-six years of age , he was chosen a representative from Boston in the General Court . Shortly afterwards he was made a selectman of the town , and entrusted with important business in Great Britain , which he executed to the public satisfaction . He distinguished himself in opposition to the scheme of the land bank , which arose about that time and for many years affected the prosperity of the Colony . And it was only after the lapse often years , when he had bec , , ome Speaker of the House of Representatives , that mainly by his exertions a proper remedy was adopted . He became successively member of the Council , Judge of Probate , Lieutenant-Governor , and Chief-Justice ,  --  all which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least in the Judicial ones , he acquitted himself very much to the satisfaction of his fellow citizens . From the time of Sir Francis Bernard 's departure , he was in fact , and in 1T*l became in name Governor of the Province . The crowning object of his ambition proved the ruin of his fortunes . His political opinions had already shaken him among his countrymen , not to mention the grasping disposition * It may not be unsuitable here to remark upon the incorrectness in dates of the notice of Governor Hutchinson in Dr. Eliot 's biographical work . The lapse of time , as well as the deficiencies of the book , renders another on a larger scale much to be desired at the present moment . // manifested in a union of so many responsible and lucrative offices . The difficult circumstances attending his assumption of the government completed his overthrow . He was compelled to choose between his offices on the one side , and his hardly-earned popularity on the other . He did not choose with the boldness required by the crisis ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle at the shrine of expediency . The struggle lasted five years , until an act , in itself of perhaps ambiguous morality , exposed to the American public certain confidential letters to persons in England , recommending measures very little short of the horrors of a military despotism . The result was decisive . The last cords which had hound his countrymen in affection to him , were then snapped , and he found himself compelled to remove from the scenes of early promise and brilliant later success , to become an unpitied though a pensioned exile at the Court of Great Britain . Private miseries followed hard upon public disappointment . A beloved daughter was taken from him by death , in the autumn of 1777 , and a son in 1780 . He outlived the latter*but a little while , regretting to his latest breath , his separation from his native land ; and ever casting a longing , lingering look towards his favorite and beautiful spot upon Milton Hill . Such was the termination of a career , which , at its outset , promised very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes of the change , to trace them all to the man *himself . He had done more than most persons to secure success , and it was only one of those extraordinary events which occur to baffle the penetration of the best human sagacity , that turned his efforts to his own destruction . Without pretension to the higher qualities of mind , he possessed such as fitted him better to influence the circle immediately around him . Our countrymen admire genius , but they follow reason . His capacity exerted itself well in the ordinary paths of human action , and the mild gravity of his external manners promoted the effect it was likely to produce . Nor would the worldly disposition which often attends this union of qualities , have been in him an obstacle to fortune , had he not fallen upon a inoment when the standard of human conduct soared far above the level of its ordinary elevation . He was tried by that standard , and he failed . We pity , while we pronounce the decree . Mr. Austin 's Life of Gerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hutchinson strikingly contrasts with the others by its humility and evidence of a broken spirit. - After reading it , the tone of the volume before us ceased to excite any feeling , but one of compassion for the author . Governor Hutchinson has other and better claims upon our gratitude . He labored hard in the field of our colonial antiquities , producing for a result two volumes of early history , which will ever be considered a mine of wealth by all future historians and antiquaries ; though their minuteness of detail and fidelity of research will not compensate with most general readers for their length and moderate literary execution . Our annels , to be interesting , should be thrown into general masses , and treated with brevity ,  --  thus only will the valuable philosophy to be deduced from them ever be made practically and extensively beneficial . The course of events would aid such a scheme . One portion , fovexauxple , might furnish the instructive lessqn of the settlement and prosperity of Massachusetts under the first charter . Another might date from the accession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extend to the general peace of 1763 ,  --  while a third could comprehend the shorter but more eventful period of the Revolution . Yet whoever should think proper to attempt a plan like this , would very soon discover , that without the aid of Hutchinson s work , his toil must have proved the labor of a life . The volume before us begins with the year 1749 , resuming where the author had before left off , and extends to the time of his own departure from Massachusetts in 1774 . TrI19*4gi1 we can not bestow upon it the sort of *pmn*endation merited by its predecessors , yet what is lost in impartiality is in a degree made up by the greater animation of the style . A prominent actor in political affairs will rarely become a very disinterested historian of the events in which he was concerned , but he will be far more agreeable to read , as the elation of victory or the bitterness of defeat will impart to his narrative all the hues of the passions , which have been nursed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this volume is cold , and does not , *s jt appears to us , devote sufficient attention to the influence of the wars during the administrations of Shirley and Powpall , upon subsequent events . We have not elsewhere seen this very fully developed . The French power , while it lasted , kept the colonists in a state of perpettial alarm . It impelled them to // make exertions , the amount of which has seldom been exceeded hy nations , even when contending for existence . if it he for a moment considered , that at some periods one third of the whole effective force was in military service of one kind or another , that nearly all of it was called out in the course of these wars , and that the burden of taxes of the capi'tal ( Boston ) was equal to two thirds of the income of the real estate , surely the spirit obtained in such a school of discipline , both active and passive , can not and ought not to be overlooked . The peace of 1783 carrie to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisition by Great Britain of all the French possessions in North America ,  --  and released the inhabitants of Massachusetts from all further anxiety s*especting a neighboring enemy . Their exertions had not been without effect in procuring this triumphant result , and the sense of them had raised the people in the estimation of the mother country , as well as in their own . But the feelings it gave rise to were somewhat different on the two sides of the Atlantic . The rulers in Great Britain were evidently fixing more closely their attention on the Colonies , as a resource : while in America , a spirit was rising , only to be controlled by the exercise of the utmost discretion and delicacy of management . This spirit was perceived by our author , and is descrihed in the following manner . Men whose minds were turned to calculations , . found that the Colonies increased so rapidly as to double the number of inhabitants in a much shorter space of time than had been imagined . From the number of inhabitants then in the several Colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , they might increase in the same proportion as in the time past , the Colonies would soon exceed the parent state . rhese considerations did not of themselves immediately occasion any plan or even a desire of independency . They produced a higher sense of the grandeur and importance of the Golonzes . Advantages in any respect , enjoyed by the subject in England , which were not enjoyed . by the subjects in the Colonies , began to be considered in an invidious light ; and men were led to inquire with greater attention than formerly into the relation in which the Colonies stood to the State from which they sprung . Every argument which would give color for the removal of this distinction was favorably received ; and from various eventn // men were prepared to think more favorably of independency , be*. lire any measures were taken with a professed design of attain .. ing to it . ' In these remarks the case is , however , but partly stated . The considerations mentioned were forcibly operating , though in different ways , on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on both sides were rapidly conducing to the same grand result . The British ministers , in seeking out for means to sustain the burdens imposed upQn their country by the war , were pleased with the idea of relieving themselves by imposing a considerable share upon such thriving and prosperous colonists . These , on their side , freed from the fears which had kept them dependent , though they did not , as our author states , begin , yet certainly did pursue a more rigid scrutiny of their rights as English citizens . A collision was hastened by the careless ignorance of one party , and by the increasing intelligence of the other . The Ministers did not possess the penetrating eye of Mr. Burke , nor had they given themselves the pains to inquire what effect their measures might have on the people they were to bear upon . They had not traced the rise and progress of the colonial government ; but with an indifference for which much of the English legislation of the last century is remarkable , holding colonists all the world over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath them to consider further than what they should command . The people of America were not d*po*cA to +i*piit down hy an offhand speech in a Parliament thousands of miles distant , and in which they had no voice . They were less convinced by the nearer and rougher argument of brute force ,  --  and as this was all the reasoning which British superciliousness condescended at that time to bring forward , it is not to be *vondered at that the dogged obstinacy of our countrymen resorted in self-defence to arms . That the Ministry did not know what they were undertaking , seems manifest from the whole tenor of their conduct . They had done nothing to prepare the minds of the people in advance for so important a change in their relations with the mother country ; nor had they paid attention to securing in the Colonies the support of any considerable portion of the more wealthy and intelligent class , whose tendencies in all States are in favor of established government . Their selection of an executive agent in Massachusetts was in the same spirit // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernard was an English adyenturer , seeking the office of Governor for the sake of the emolument , without a particle of claim upon the affections , or even the sympathy of the colonists . In one of his letters , he recommends himself to his employers because he came free from all bias in favor of this ( the provincial ) form of government , and able as well as willing to examine its defects . ' However much this might have operated at home in his favor , it was not likely to make him more happy , or the people more satisfied in Massachusetts . The bare suspicion would at all times have been enough to set them in opposition to any Governor , the best founded in their affections , much more against a total stranger . Nor was Bernard better calculated to influence them by his personal character . He was blunt and irritable , little able to hold any check upon his feelings , and entirely without that nice tact , so necessary in difficult positions in government , which readily foresees the operation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though respectable , he was not equal to those he was destined to oppose , and he had no soothing ways to undo the effect his adversaries could produce . On the contrary , even with the best intentions , he was perpetually committing blunders that involved him with them deeper and deeper , until they finally laid him completely at their mercy . We are aware that our author assigns a different origin for all Bernard 's difficulties . He trnees them to the disappointment of a single family , in not obtaining for one of themselves the place of Chief Justice , and their anger that he ( the author ) should have gained it . To enable our retAers to judge more clearly as to the reasonableness of this , we extract the passage . Governor Bernard had been but a few weeks in the Province , when he found himself under the necessity either of making a particular family and its connexions extremely inimical to him , or of doing what would not have been approved of by the greater part of the Province . Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first surviving judge and two other judges , together with several of the principal gentlemen of the bar , signified their desire to the Governor , that he would appoint the Lieutenant Governor ( i. e. the author ) to be the successor . When Mr. Shirley was in administration , he had encouraged , if not promised a gentleman at the // bar ( James Otis , Esq . of Barnstable ) that upon a vacancy in the Superior Court , he should have a seat there . A vacancy hap .. pened , and Mr. Shirley , from a prior engagement , or for some other reason , disappointed him . He Was at this time Speaker of the House of Representatives , and he made application to Governor Bernard that the first surviving judge might be appointed Chief Justice , and that he might take the place of a Judge . His son also , with great warmth , engaged in behalf of his father , and not meeting with that encouragement which he expected , vowed revenge , if he should finally fail of success . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing had passed between the Governor and Lieutenant Governor upon the subject . At length it was intimated to the Lieutenant Governor , that the Governor , when he had been applied to by many persons in his behalf , was at a loss to account for his silence . This caused a conversation , in which the Lieutenant Governor signified that he had desired no persons to apply in his behalf and had avoided applying himself , that the Governor might the more freely use his own judgment , in appointing such person as should appear to him most fit . And soon after , upon the Lieutenant Governor 's being informed of the Governor 's intention to nominate him to the place , he gave his opinion , that a refusal to comply with the solicitations which had been made to the Governor by the other person , would cause a strong opposition to his administration , and at the same time , assured the Governor , that he would not take amiss the compliance , but would support his administration with the same zeal as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lieutenant Governor should finally refuse the place , the other person would not be nominated . Thereupon , the Lieutenant Governor was appointed . The expected opposition ensued . The resentment in the disappointed persons was also as strong against the Lieutenant Governor for accepting the place , as if he had sought it , and had opposed their solicitations . Both the gentlemen had been friends to government . From this time they were at the head of every measure in opposition , not merely in those points which eoncerncd the Governor in his administration , but in such as concerned the authority of Parliament , the opposition to which first began in this Colony , and was moved and conducted by one of them , both in the assembly and the town of Boston . From so small a spark , a great fire seems to have been kindled . ' This explanation appears to us to recommend itself , neither by its principles nor by the conclusion to which it is made to // lead . Our author admits recommending ( though it must be confessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole statement makes out to be improper , and not likely to be approved by the greater part of the Province . And the defeat of a generally unpopular appointment is made the spark , which kindled all the fire that raged so long in the Province . At the same time , it ought to be kept in mind that the receiver of this unsolicited appointment was already Counsellor , Judge of Probate , and Lieutenant Governor . But we will not enlarge upon this topic . There is no mistaking the object of such observations , and similar ones may be found thoughout the volume . Its principal defect grows very naturally out of the circumstances under which it was written ,  - -  circumstances which created in the author a necessity either of condemning himself , or of ascribing to sfngle individuals a very undue proportion of power over the events of the Revolution . It is most unquestionably true , that the vigorous mind of James Otis materially hastened the course of affairs . It is not impossible , though we admit no such thing , that private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but in all this , though we may find a spark , yet there is no evidence of any material inflammable enough to catch from it . The tinder was furnished in plenty by the British Government . This and this only , is responsible for the consequent combustion . Had James Otis been ten times more powerful than he was , had he actually taken the place occupied by Hutchinson himself , he must have failed exactly as Hutchinson did . The only result would have been that his arm would have become nerveless against the force of the very same spirit and arguments he did in fact use , coming from other members of the community . Mr. Otis , like every other public man of that day , drew all his strength from the soundness of the principles entertained by him in common with the great body of citizens for whom he acted . This is a point essential to the formation of a correct opinion of the times . To be sure , they have the merit , and no small one it is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of guiding the public mind to adopt the most practicable mode to maintain them , but they have no more . The substance was there as fixed as the rock of ages , and not all their united efforts would have made it a xvhit less immovable. // The real cause of the difficulty may be found in the disposition of the rulers in Great Britain , to alter the relation between her and her Colonies without the consent of the latter . This was first manifested in 1763 , immediately after the victorious war with France , by an order to the Governor of Massachusetts to procure a more exact account of the population of the Province ,  --  then more decisively in the sugar act , and finally by the direct measure of the stamp act . There was no hesitation manifested by the colonists Lin resisting these measures . The struggle of the Revolution began at once . It was a struggle carried on by the whole people , and took its shape where it should have done , in their Representatives ' hall , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of Hutchinson , which had before that time been great , vanished almost immediately . The principal memorial of it may be found in the Address of the Legislature , upon the Stamp Act . His power over the minds of his colleagues in the council counteracted , in this case , the efforts of the Patriots in the other House . The result was a paper not expressive of the principles prevailing in the Province ,  --  and bearing the stamp of expediency in almost every line . It is a little curious and very illustrative of the character of Hutchinson , that in another part of this volume he congratulates himselP upon the effect this address was supposed to have had in producing the repeal of the ohnoxious law ,  --  and complains that he got no merit with the opposing party , because he begged for it as matter of favor , and did not claim it as a right . The power of nice discrimination between the moral influence of different lines of conduct does not appear to have been his brightest point . The Patriots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divert the current then running , feeble as it was , drew their attention to its author , and the means of preventing any thing of the kind through his agency for the future . The presence of Hutchinson in the Council , with several others holding official situations , was an embarrassment they naturally sought to get rid of . At the election of councillors , in 1766 they were all left out . The blow was as effective as it was mortifying . Governor Bernard felt it sensibly , and most indiscreetly allowed his f*lings to escape in complaints in his public papers . This producing no effect far // ther than increased confidence in the propriety of the measure , the Governor and his Lieutenant resorted to a contrivance which is too curious not to be given in our author 's words . Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson had been every year , until the present , elected for the council . The first session of the Assembly this year , he attended frequently , but did not vote , nor take any share in the debates . The Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day of the next session , and after the Governor had delivered his speech , they left the council together . In the speech , the Governor had recommended " the support of the authority of government and the maintenance of the honor of the Province . " The House in their answer to the speech take notice of the Lieutenant Governor 's appearing in council , and remarked that , " if the honorable gentleman was introduced by your excellency , we apprehend that the happiest means of supporting the authority of the government , or maintaining the honor of the Province was not consulted therein . But , if ' he came in and took a seat of his own motion , we are constrained to say that it affords a new and additional instance of ambition and a lust of power to what we have before observed . " This was illiberal treatment of the Lieutenant Governor , and brought into the speech by Mr. Hawley , a lawyer of distinguished character in the county of Hampshire , but of very strong resentments . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Chief Justice in the Court of Common Law , and to revenge himself : , brought this public abuse against him in the Assembly . The Governor directed the Secretary to search the books for precedents , and caused his report to be laid before the House , accompanied with a message . The House thereupon came to a resolve that by charter , the Lieutenant Governor has no right to sit in council when he is not elected . As it was not advisable to lay claim to a right of voting in council after it had been so long dormant , it was a dispute de lana caprina but had a tendency , notwithstanding , to alienate the other branches from the Governor , at a time when union and harmony were more than ever to be desired . The Lieutenant Governor therefore signified , by a letter to the Governor , his determination to absent himself from the council-chamber , that he might not be the pccasion of any controversy between the Governor and the House of Representatives , presuming that this act could not be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right of the Governor and Council to admit the Lieutenant Governor , when // they thought proper . This letter the Governor thought fit to lay before the House , and to desire that the dispute might subside without prejudice to the right in question . This did not satisfy the House . The Governor had repeatedly recommended to the Council to take the matter under their consideration , but a majority wished to avoid any share in the controversy . Upon a message from the House , they so far concerned themselves , as to resolve unanimously that " the Lieutenant Governor , by charter , has not any constitutional right to a seat at the board , either with or without a voice ,  --  but so far as precedents , and one contemporaneous with the charter , can justify , he is excusable in taking his seat at the time referred to . " Still this did not satisfy , and the House , in a further message to the Council , insisted , that as they had denied the constitutional right of the Lieutenant Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conduct could not be excused . ' Which was the most illiberal , the words by Mr. Hawley , or the commentary upon them , we shall not now stop to inquire . A few remarks upon that subject in general , may find their place presently . That a serious object was proposed in the extraordinary measure resorted to , can hardly admit of a reasonable doubt . The House understood it perfectly , and took , perhaps rather unexpectedly to the managers , the most decisive course to defeat it . After that event , it occurred to the Lieutenant Governor that the subject was de lana caprina , or matter of moonshine . But surely it was somewhat late to think of this , for the serious injury , in alienating the other branches from the Governor at a time when union and harmony were more than ever to be desired , ' was already done . And it would be rather difficult to believe that these persons bad not foreseen this , yet thought the object more than a compensation , if we did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things the most strikingly placed but confusedly perceptible . The clearest comment upon the whole proceeding is to be found in the disapprobation of it substantially expressed by Lord Shelburne , then in office . Its operation was decisive . The opportunity for a recurrence of good feeling , presented by the repeal of the stamp act , was entirely thrown away . The party remained drawn up exactly as before . Sir Francis Bernard was by no means a bad man ,  --  and in ordinary times might have made a tolerable Governor . But // rJarr be was not equal to the management of such delicate and critical points . He had taken no trouble to inform himself of the character of the people , and he disliked their form of government . The consequence was a perpetual variation , on his side , of the line between the executive and legislative branches . His messages do little eLse than coax , scold or bully ; - sometimes he undertakes to dictate and sometimes to bargain . Almost always he puts himself somewhere in the wrong . Such a character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes of thinking were peculiarly stiW whose habits were not a little formal , and who joined to all this a penetration and shrewdness of intellect* which knew how to take advantage of the least error . Between such parties , the result of a contest could not he doubtful . A series of little disputes terminated in an open breach . The British Ministry , too late aware of their mistake , recalled Bernard , not however before an address had passed the Legislature , requesting his removal . Our author was selected to succeed him ,  --  a choice which , bad it been made in the first place , might have effected something ;  --  but his agency in the scenes of the last five years of Bernard 's administration had been too well understood , to afford any probability of an improvement by his means . Nevertheless , he did carry with him even at that late period many persons , his friends from long habit , and had in his favor the associations which birth , long residence and good private character rarely fail to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , procured from seeing them extensively in his official duties , rendered him far more a match than his predecessor for their antagonists . He only failed because he had no foundation to build upon . The finest capacity could have succeeded little better than his . The series of controversial papers emanating from his pen is highly respectable , as well for tact in avoiding difficulties , as for skill in urging positions ,  --  . and though not equal to that coming from the opposite side , the failure is more in , the substance than the management . We shall not pretend to follow the course of the disputes . Those ' who have any curiosity in regard to them , will find a rich resource in the volume of State Papers published in Boston . some years ago , which supplies many important ones not to be found iii the appendix to the work now under consider-* // ation . We can not pass over in silence those involving the main question of the Revolution . Our author describes himself as alarmed at the progress , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town meetings in Boston , and corresponding committees in the country ,  --  and tempted to make another and a final effort at resistance , by laying before the Legislature a labored argument in favor of the authority of Parliament over the Colonies . This was done by the Message of January 6th , 1773 . The answers by the two Houses contain an equally labored reply . The contest has furnished few more valuable historical memorials , than these papers . The argument of Governor Hutchinson rests entirely upon one principle in the English Law , and is built up by perpetual appeals to human authority . The single principle appears to us to be a narrow as well as entirely unsound one , and not to be fortified by the approbation of a hundred centuries . The assertion that a supreme , unlimited , uncontrollable authority must rest somewhere in a State , and that in Great Britain it rests in Parliament , is made by Judge Blackstone , hitherto the clearest expounder of the English Law . But he does not satisfactorily answer the objection he himself quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand a moment before the following words from the reply to Hutchinson by his Council , Supreme or unlimited authority can with fitness belong only to the Sovereign of the Universe ; and that fitness is derived from the perception of his nature . To such authority , directed by infinite wisdom and infinite goodness , is due both active and passive obedience ; which , as it constitutes the happiness of rational creatures , should with cheerfulness and from choice be unlimitedly paid by them . But this can be said with truth of no other authority whatever . ' Indeed , the very idea seems to us to be no less than a libel upon the Creator , and to change the constitution of England into an oligarchical despotism , not justified by any theory of government , nor by any historical experience . A single tyrant rules his subjects , by acting upon their fears . Nero himself could do no more than force society from its natural and proper basis ,  --  the idea of any body in a state , which can do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it appears to us false ,  --  especially , as in the case of England , it deprives her people of that essential original power to correct , which , after // all that has been said of Parliament , we believe to constitute the very breath of its nostrils . Believing , therefore , this idea of despotic sovereignty necessary somewhere , to he necessary no where in government , we consider the whole edifice raised upon it by the author as falling to the ground . For admitting that all the precedents possible could be summoned in its support , they never can in themselves go quite so far as to make a principle . A regard for the lessons which all human experience has taught to man , is one of the useful modes which the divine Providence has devised to secure some degree of permanency to the higher enjoyments of life ,  --  but if , from a regard , it becomes implicit obedience , the very object of improvement , by avoiding evil and preserving good , is at once defeated . Most especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has formed , though it should never be needlessly invaded , should not be allowed to invade in its turn . In considering such interests as those of mankind , we surely want some guides from higher sources . We must look to nature , the purposes of creation , to that philosophy which makes man a thin king being , and responsible for his actions to a God . Here is the point upon which our author 's bark found its destruction . His mind had not expanded itself to the extent which the necessity demanded , it was locked up in the small compass of a precedent . All beyond was waste . But in point of fact , the footing of Hutchinson upon precedent was as feeble as it had been upon principle . He was so unfortunate as to quote the exceptions to prove the rule . All history should be trusted more as a warning than a guide ,  - -  there is none in which the alternations of human passion will not furnish authorities for almost any side of a dispute . Is it not so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strikingly so in the case under consideration ? In the early days of the Colony , the Puritans , moved by the ascendency of their brethren in Parliament , recognised its authority . In 1757 , the hopes and fears of the colonists , as to the reimbursement of their expenses in the French war , were so operated upon ( and that by this very man too , ) as to produce from the General Court an explicit admission of the power of Parliament to legislate for them . The victory of the evil political maxim of* temporary expediency , which ever has had and ever will have great influence in communities , produced in both these cases precedents , which , however time might have sanctioned them , // must ever have been utterly unsafe and improper to rest upon . The only true foundation , intrinsic justice , is not to be found . But we must consider on the other hand , the general spirit of the colonial history ,  --  the origin of the settlement , and the mode in which it was conducted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the blind instinct of self-preservation , and without a thought upon their ultimate fate . They acted understandingly from the beginning , first by purchasing a right to the territory they were to occupy , and next by securing a recognition of their social system by the sovereign who claimed them as subjects of Great Britain . That recognition was in the shape of a charter , granted by Charles the First , in which the nature of their situation was as well defined as the circumstances of the time would admit . Their rights to life , liberty and property were clearly reserved ,  --  not a line admits the authority of Parliament to legislate unlirnitedly for them , not a word can be found surrendering a single privilege which , as En*Jishmen and as men , proper ) y be ) oncred to them . The general tendency of all the subsequent history is to prove not only the existence , hut the perfect understanding of this principle by the colonists . If examples were necessary , they may be found in the answer of the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now considering . The exceptions , which form all the substance of his argument , are manifestly occasioned by temporary circumstances , acting against the usual dispositioii of the people . Their sense of weakness caused a constant anxiety during the period of the first Charter , which nothing but the long series of troubles in England prevented from being justified . Peace brought with it an attack upon this Charter ; and the beats that followed that event are well known from the deposition of Sir Edmund Andros , from the natural consequence of which the leaders were only saved by the revolution that took place contemporaneously in the mother country . Another Charter was obtained from William the Third , varying a little , and but little , the terms of the compact ,  --  the same so far as the rights of Parliament were involved ;  --  and yet the spirit in which this new instrument was received manifests distinctly enough the feeling of the people . Then followed the Indian and French Wars , in which the *diead of the nearest danger undoubtedly led to a neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disposition to lean for support upon the power of Great Britain , and to avoid as // much as possible causes of irritation . But the spirit , though working in another direction , was in substance the same . It is to be seen in the enthusiasm with which the project of the reduction of Canada was undertaken , and when that project succeeded , in the decided manner in which it resumed its old and well-accustomed channel . The cession of the French territories removed one great cause of dependence ,  --  the Colony had acquired confidence in its own strength , and this was the moment , when the favorite doctrine of the people hurst forth , in all its genuine vigor , and produced fruit early enough to show the depth to which its root had struck . At the hazard of being tedious , we have sketched the outline of the whole colonial history , for the purpose of shewing how totally our author mistook its general character . The subject is worthy of more consideration than is usually given to it . Many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our liberty , in our opinion , that Declaration was only the falling of the fruit when it had become ( perhaps a little prematu1ely ) ripe . No new light hurst upon the people upon the occasion . The separation from Great Britain involved no change in the political theories they had entertained . It was placed upon clear and definite grounds . The general and vague idea of liberty , that dazzling image with the face of a goddess and the heart of a j ) rostitute , entered not into the question . The colonists had enjoyed the substance from the day they put their feet upon American ground . And it was not the desire to change , hut the desire to keep and secure , which produced their Independence . They made little or no change in their domestic affairs , after that object was gained . One of the States at least retains the same form of government , which she had when she was a Province . To talk of the influence of the ambition of a few leaders , seems absurd , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to principles , the soundness of which the community acknowledged . The people , that is the great mass of responsible members of the State had inherited , they did not acquire , the extraordinary jealousy of their rights , which is apparent through the century and a half of their preceding history ; and when they complained , they could put their finger on the spot that was hurt . They asked a remedy . It was refused . They adopted the only alternative which was left , but they set nothing unnecessarily afloat . The // practical good they aimed to arrive at was , not to put at hazard , through their own act , the good they had enjoyed . And this is the only rational sort of revolution . Contrast this course with that of the inhabitants of France . Mr. Dumont of Genev* tells us , incidentally , that he happened to pass through a town in that country at the time fixed for the election of members to the States General . The people knew not how to proceed with an election ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Secretary , or voting ticl*et , and he says that he devoted half aji hour of leisure time to drawing up a few rules for their direction in the dilemma . Here indeed was room for the ambition of a few . Here was a very small stock of knowledge and experience , upon which to set up the husiness of self-government . Can it he wondered at that the experiment failed ? Even in England the conduct of John Hampden was heroic , hecause he devoted himself hy it to the instruction of his countrymen in their rights . The country could not produce many Hampdens to guide them ,  --  and it did produce enough then to confuse them . It is not saying too much , to assert that the intelligence of America rendered unnecessary that sort of superior guidance , and this was one of the causes , which contributed most powerfully to our success . To return to Governor Hutchinson , from whom we have digressed perhaps too far . He felt the difficulty presented to him in the point of taxation without representation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have inspired in him some doubt of his foundation . This position was , that the right of a colonist to he represented , must he held to lie dormant when he leaves the mother country , and to revive again upon his return ,  --  that to him , while absent , it was unavoidahly lost , and that compensation must he looked for in the advantages he derives in his new condition from the protection of her power . The reply of the House of Representatives is here conclu*ive ,  --  that a right positively secured to the colonists hy charter will he singularly valuable to them , if they must cease to he Colonists in order to enjoy it .. It does appear somewhat absurd to suppose that the original settlers , coming with intentions and ohjects like theirs , should stickle so much to retain a privilege , the enjoyment of which hy them or their posterity must pre-suppose the frustration of all those intentions . If they really proposed to remain here , of xvhat value could such a privilege possibly he ? Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , and making representation impracticable in Parliament , seems naturally to haVe a tendency directly the reverse of that supposed by our author . It forms the basis of Independence . If the circumstances of the case are such , that men , understanding their own interests , and capalAe of exercising the rights which belong to them , are yet by position debarred from consulting those interests and using those rights , it follows that that position is unnatural , and ought if practicable to be changed . The plain question may he stated in the following manner . Were the Americans entitled to exercise rights established by the laws of society , confirmed to them by the common law of England , and expressly stipulated for in a charter from the King ? Did they stand in a position enabling them fairly to claim the exercise of such rights ? Did they in truth make the claim ? The affirmative establishes the justice of resistance against the aggressions of the British Ministry in Parliament , and the pertinacity of these in maintaining the negative fixes the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this contest , . is very certain . He admits that in England , and by the Ministry , his attempt was regarded as injudicious ,  --  and endeavors to console himself with the approbation of Lord Thurlow ; a compliment from whom is inserted in a note , composed with evident marks of satisfaction with and reliance upon it . The fact shows , what we have already remarked as characteristic of the man , a disposition to rely upon authority rather than intrinsic weight of reasoning . That Lord Thurlow , with the whole body of his party in England , should condemn the patriotic side of this question , is nierely in character , and proves nothing beyond their consistency in politics . The Americans too could call up , in their turn , names like those of Chatham and of Burke , names of far higher power over the feelings of posterity . But the question is not settled by so doing . Great men are after all but inen ,  --  and as such , liable in th' formation of opinion to the influence of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps growing out of the immediate circumstances by which it is brought forward .. The profound Bacon long since observed , that the human nnderstanding is like an unequal mirror to the rays of lighb which , mixing its own nature with the nature of things , distorts and perverts ' them . While this is true , and true it must be while man remains what be is , the judgment of posterity upon // controversies important to it , can never be properly drawn but from the genuine strength of the arguments presented . As Lord Thurlow condescended to sanction those of the author , without adding any new ones of his own , we must be permitted to pass him by , and think exactly as we did before . The Americans engaged in the controversy were not his inferiors in ability , and they had motives of action seldom even dreamed of by that nobleman . Lord Thurlow raised himself to the exalted position he occupied in life , mainly by his own exertions , and we are not disposed to qualify the praise such energy deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the support of a few principles of public justice at once put to hazard his life , his liberty , and every thing commonly deemed valuable in the world . This naturally leads us to the opinions expressed by our author of his leading antagonists ,  --  Otis , Thacher , the Adamses , Hawley , Bowdoin and Hancock . He has drawn characters of several , which the editor tells us were left with the option to insert or omit them . At this day , we can neither regret nor feel indignant at them . The car of victory , which rolled over the body of the author , has borne up those men in triumph . They have received from their country and posterity a reward of which no effort by their ancient enemy can deprive them . The instance may , nevertheless , be used as no unprofitable example of the vanity of all similar attacks . According to Hutchinson , every one of the above personages had a private motive for his conduct ,  --  so small that , when assigned , its inadequacy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack . In all political matters , the motives of the principal actors will form a great subject of inquiry . Human nature is so constituted , that the distinctions between right and wrong , virtue and vice , are differently viewed by different individuals , and , according to the irregular movements of the passions , at different times by the same individuals . As a consequence , mixed motives may in the best of men impel particular courses of conduct , and the same motives will not at all times operate equally . Perfect consistency is so little in keeping with man 's natural disposition , that the attributing to any individual the same motives for all his conduct , argues inaccuracy of judgment in the person pronouncing , or a narrow and artificial character in the person pronounced upon . On // the other hand , there is a general uniformity in the character of the greater number , which renders the supposition of certain leading motives of action , probable , and of others improbable . Yet in every single case there is room to reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the excited world of controversial politics , an immense field is opened for the construction of motives , and that the imputation of infamous ones becomes the commonest and niost paltry expedient of party malignity . If we for a moment recollect , that from George Washington down ward , scarcely a single great man of the Revolution escaped charges of every sort of dishonesty , the rrima facie weight to be attached to them may readily be estimated . That each or any of those men were absolutely free from human imperfection , will not be asserted by any reasonable being ; but that their general character protects them completely from such accusations as were made , can as little he denied . When we call to mind what sacrifices they made in fortune or in the field , and more than all , what legacies they left as evidences of purity of purpose ,  --  great , flourishing public Institutions claimed at the risk of existence , fought for at the cost of oceans of blood , and secured at last by the yet most difficult task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas to suppose , that we shall sit down and listen without contempt to the tale , that this man loved popular applause , that made patriotism compensate for pecuniary defalcation , a third took offence in a court of law , and a fourth because he was not made justice of the peace . Governor Hutchinson ought not to have indulged himself in such charges , because he had most felt their injustice in his own case ; - perhaps had not been altogether discreet in avoiding to give occasion for them . We believe his asseveration , that he never , in his public character , took any one step , in which he did not mean to serve the true interest of his countrymen , and to preserve to them every liberty consistent with it , or with their connexion with the kingdom . ' His ambition , whatever it may have been , injured himself more than the community , to which in many respects it proved useful . His errors flowed from the nature of his character , combined with the circumstances in which he was placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Massachusetts forever dependent on Great Britain . He considered it better to temporize , and even sacrifice some rights , than risk all in maintaining them . Such // are ever the doctrines of timid politicians . We will not condemn him too harshly for opinions often held very successfully in more peaceful times , but we can award him no praise . His was a case , in which discretion was not the better part of valor . The punishment appears to have been quite adequate to the offence . We will not strive to add to it , by retorting upon him what he attempted to do to others . A single point must be made an exception to this rule , principally because of the effect it produced upon events . He allowed himself to make suggestions in private letters to England , calculated to draw upon him an awful responsibility . We can not admire the judgment nor the moral sense , which coud secretly dictate advice likely to bring upon his countrymen all the rigor of military despotism . The letters transmitted to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never think of the mea*ures necessary for the peace and good order of the Colonies without pain ; there must be an abridgment of what are called English liberties . I relieve myself by considering , that in a remove from the state of nature to the most perfect state of government , there must be a great restraint of natural liberty . I doubt , whether it is possible to project a system of government , in which a colony three thousand miles distant shall enjoy all the liberty of the parent state . I am certain I have never yet seen the projection . ' We have little disposition to justify the mode of obtaining , or the uses made of these letters . Much of the author 's complaint upon this subject appears to us to be well founded . Neither generosity nor justice are obligations commonly attended to in political warfare . Yet after admitting every thing that may be said , the letter itself with its significant paragraph remains , in its naked deformity . Its secresy is not its worst feature . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the recommendation , could only be justified by the perfect soundness of the reasoning upon which it was based . Does the paragraph quoted contain such reasoning ? Or is the startling conclusion jumped at , over all the obstacles of natural right and common social justice ? Would the most unrelenting military tyrant reason otherwise ? Did the members of the Holy Alliance , or Nicholas in crushing his Polish subjects , reason otherwise ? They always profess to be pained at the measures necessary for the peace and good order of their // subjects ; ' they content themselves by considering , that in a remove from the state of nature to the most perfect ( i. e. to their ) state of government , there must he a great restraint of natural liberty . ' The great point , the use of force against all the principles of right , being thus justified , it surely must remain indifferent to the People , what name is given to their government . It is in fact a despotism . Surely the author knew enough of the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what are called English Liberties was not to be effected , without much blood . If he did not , he was not fit to govern them . If he did , we can form no exalted opinion of his sensibility . Possibly he may have regarded the probable consequences as a parent does the punishment of a child . But wretched is that parent , who punishes his child for a reasonable request ,  --  still more wretched is he , if his only excuse rest upon an abridgment of privileges , which nature and the voice of society have admitted to be just . We have touched little upon the want of candor as well as of prudence , which the whole proceeding on the part of Governor Hutchinson evinced , because these form the lightest part of the censure he deserved . He might have foreseen the chances that would lead to his detection , and the personal consequences to ensue upon it . His influence vanished . The Legislature voted to request his removal ; and he was shortly after glad to obtain a leave of absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea ships came only to prove to the Governor how totally his authority was at an end . The Chief Justice was impeached , the law ceased to be administered , the courts were shut up . At this moment , Hutchinson left the Province , and his history stops :  --  a moment of immense importance to America , as from it the first Congress of the States takes its date . The interest however becomes transferred to another scene , and the particular history of Massachusetts merges in that of the Union . Hutchinson was no longer in a condition to pursue ibis favorite occupations . The offer of a baronetcy and a pension was poor pay for the loss of old friends , and all the motives of action which made life valuable . He lingered a few years among a people , who did not feel as he felt , and whose general contempt for poor colonists was too great , to be lost in sympathy for the selfsacrifice of some single persons . He died not long after closing these pages ,  --  . saved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to attend the Independence of the Colo* ny , falsified . There is reason to believe that , had he lived , he would have returned to live as a private citizen among us , but the decree of Providence cut short his intentions . The general conclusion which we draw from reading this work ir , that as a partisan history it is valuable . The facts appear to be stated with the same accuracy that distinguished the author 's preceding volumes , but the gloss put upon them must deprive it of the same sort of authority which those deserved . The history itself in these later times , assumed a character calling for a different description of mind . It remains even now to be written , and must remain so until an intellect of great natural strength , combined with freedom from the prejudices of the times , and a habit of rigid analysis , shall evolve from the mass of our materials , the most instructive lesson of the world . Mark well ! says that old man eloquent ' of Greece , for though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them remains forever to the wise . His words will apply now as forcibly , as when he was recalling to the memory of his countrymen the times of their energy and glory . If there be a portion of history susceptible of being constantly used to advantage , it is the period of the American Revolution . The spirit that animated the men of that time was , it is true , above the level of ordinary life , but it diffused itself in channels of practical experiment , the benefit of which we feel every day . It is for us to preserve , and not to create . Yet tbere is danger of our falling fast asleep in the lap of pros* perity . There is greater danger , that the place of the true spirit may be assumed by another and a different one , which , impelling ambitious men to be doing , may under the most specious phrases substitute only a restless appetite for change in the room of a rational desire for good government . rIlle prospect before us has some dark shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot-Louse patriotism ,  --  and political quacks have not been without success in disseminating their poisons in the community . Salvation is only to be found in holding on to the good we have gained ,  --  and this effect must he aided by a clear knowledge of the ways by which it was gained . Our ancient patriots promised little , and performed much . They knew that to be agitated was not to be happy , and always felt sure of the value of their object , before they encountered evil to attain // it . While our institutions are safe , we have little to do but to follow the path before us , but the occasion is fitting to prepare ourselves for the time when they may be in danger . The spirit may remain quiet , but it should not be lost . Let it be cherished in secret , by a thorough study of the principles of our fathers , and still more of the modes in which these were carried into such successful operation.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
