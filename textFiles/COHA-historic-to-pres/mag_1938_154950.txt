GRANDMA CALLED IT CARNAL-Bertha Damon-Simon &; Schuster ( $2 ) . <P> Readers who liked Clarence Day 's Life With Father and other such recent memoirs should be glad to meet Bertha Damon 's Grandmother Griswold . Author Damon was brought up by her grandmother in a small Connecticut town according to the gospel of Thoreau .

For as a grownup Author Damon has reacted against the Thoreau-inspired austerity of her grandmother 's house and diet by building and remodeling houses , collecting cookbooks . Reacting against Grandma 's taboo on pets , Author Damon makes a hobby of cocker puppies and little pigs . <P> But notwithstanding Grandma 's hard-bitten highmindedness , Bertha Damon remembers her with affection as well as amazement . One of her most touching memories recalls how Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She apologized for two things : 1 ) for having refused to let Bertha have pets and 2 ) for having all her life lacked will power .
