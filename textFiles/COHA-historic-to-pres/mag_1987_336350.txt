For a journalist , covering the travels of a major figure in the news is a coveted assignment . It can also be a fairly brutal experience . Although there are exhilarating moments of spectacle or significance , there are also logistical nightmares , frustrating stretches of tedium and constant weariness . John Paul II 's ten-day U.S. tour was among the most demanding ever for TIME journalists . A five-member TIME team began shadowing the Pope upon his arrival in Miami on Sept. 10 . Rome Bureau Chief Sam Allis , who will have traveled 18,000 miles with the Pope in twelve days , is groggy and impressed . " I spent 14 months on the road in the 1984 presidential campaign . The Pope 's schedule is even more arduous than a presidential candidate 's . " Says Photographer Dirck Halstead : " For me , this tour has been the most exhausting since Richard Nixon first went to China in 1972 . " <P> Allis has reported John Paul 's travels before . He has been stationed in Rome , where his duties include covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pontiff 's entourage to India in 1986 and to Poland this year . But this trip had some especially grueling conditions . First , following the eleven-hour flight from Rome , there was the blast-furnace Florida heat . Then there was the pace . Allis often found himself asking , " How do you attend the Mass and the background briefing at the same time ? " Then there was the unusually tight security around the Holy Father . To cover a papal Mass at 10 a.m. in Miami , reporters had to muster at 7 a.m. before being bused to and from the event . <P> For Photographers Halstead , Dennis Brack , Antonio Suarez and Ken Jarecke , there were hair-raising incidents . Cameras and lenses were put out of action by the rain . During a torrential downpour in Miami , lightning began to flash around the tower that Suarez was perched on to photograph the papal Mass below . He was unhurt , though a TV cameraman was later injured when a bolt struck the tower . In New Orleans , Suarez and Jarecke had to lug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 90 degrees-plus heat from the press buses to a security checkpoint . " Despite all the problems , " says Halstead , " the sight of hundreds of thousands of people gathered together is still a photographer 's dream . Even smaller events , like seeing the Pope in a classroom in Los Angeles answering children 's questions , those are the moments we live for . "
