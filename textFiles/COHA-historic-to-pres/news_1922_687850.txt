A new sweetness has been discov-1 ered in- the " sugared " bills of the Adams - Beatty ? Francois corporation , which appraised the surface and elevated lines for the eiro . Heretofore it has been disclosed that typists , tracers , chainmen , and the like , were billed to the city as nepraisera : that political appointees who did little or no work were charged to the city as expert appraisers ; that appraisers were billed for more time than employed on the utilities ; that employes ' services were billed to the city after they had severed their connection with the appraisal , and that one man who was in Indiana was charged for as working on appraisals in Chicago . Three Weeks Ahead In Charges . Now it develops that the A.-11. - F. concern charged the city for services of an appraiser for three weeks before . he says , he was employed . At first glance that looks like doing the impossible . But the official voucher in , the city controller 's office ' thews that the firm charged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caldwell , for twenty-one days In December , 1919. while Mr. Caldwell testified that he was first engaged and went to work not earlier than Jan. 5 , 1920 . Caldwell was asked nothing about 1919 , because the council subcommittee , Aldermen Schwartz , Guernsey and Woodhull , had not then discovered that Caldwell 's services had been charged to the city for any part of 1919 . It did not occur to any of the aldermen or their attorneys , Louis E. Hart and Lawrence A. Cohen , that it was possible to charge for the services of an appraiser before he was employed . But the bill of the A.-B. - F. showing the " Record of appraisal force engaged in appraisement of Chicago surface lines for period , Dec. 1 to Dec . Si , 1919 " contains the name of D. C. Caldwell . It is now part of the official city voucher in the city controller 's office . City Soaked for $1.260-It show 's the " number of days actively engaged " by each alleged and real appraiser . It represents that Mr. Caldwell worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in the week ending Dec. 20 , six days in the week ending Dec. 27 ; and three:days in the period ending Dec. makestotal of twenty-one days . For these the city paid $60 per day , or a total of $1,260 . The only explanation of the way this scheme was worked , which sounds plausible , came from an A.-B. - F. employe . He said that the bills for 1919 to the city were not made up until 1920 and after Mr. Caldwell had been engaged and started working . An official explanation might-have been obtained from W. S. Adams , head of the firm , but he declined an invitation to testify before the aldermen . 11. 0 . Beatty . who was a partner in the concern , is expected to testify this week . He may be able to throw some light on this particular transaction , although several employes , Including chief engineers and bookkeepers , already have testified that they were instructed by Adams to keep all information regarding the utility appraisals away from Beatty . Beatty May Tell of " Sugar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisal work whatever , that his time was taken up with industrial appraisals . Bid services , however , were billed to the city as follows : In November , 1919 , 26 days at $60 a day ; In August . 1920 , 22 days at $60 Peel in September , same year , 27 days at $60 per ; in October , 26 days at $60 per , and In November . 26 days at $60 per . The total Is 127 days , for which the city paid $8.833 . The fact that Beatty has agreed to testify gives every hope that he will tell what he knows about the " suger. "
