ALL PRISONERS HERE A Story IRVING PFEFFER p HARMACIST 'S MATE NORDEN Was dreaming when the guard woke him . He was dreaming he was on trial , in a long empty room like the night court he had seen once in Camden . He stood at attention , but he could not keep the muscles of his neck rigid ; they twitched with every breath he took . Someone was reading the charges against him , but he could not make out the words ; they came to his ears in a harsh , threatening , familiar murmur , just beyond understanding . He strained to hear , but there was only the knowledge of vague , monstrous crimes , and the feeling of having been found out . Then he was awake . He had been sleeping slumped over on his desk , with his head pillowed in his arms . The guard was shaking him . " Okay , " he said . " I 'm all right . " His eyes felt bloodshot and heavy , and his hand trembled when he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for you , Doc , " the guard said , and Norden saw that there were two other men in the room , An SP stood just inside the open , barred door , his legs apart , and his hands wrapped around his club . In front of him , arms folded over his chest , stood the prisoner . His uniform was torn , and blood and dirt had clotted on his unshaven face . " Okay , " Norden said . " I 'll take care of him . " The sick , shaky feeling was receding inside him , and his hands were steady when he reached for the papers the guard held out . " You can shove off , " he said to the SP . The guard was a tall , thin gunner 's mate , with a lined face . He looked from Norden to the prisoner , who stood staring straight ahead of him , and said conversationally , " I hear this joker gave the boys a hard time coming over . I 'll be outside , Doc . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . It opened and closed , and there was the rumble of the bolt sliding into place , and then only the heavy sound of breathing from the men sleeping around him . Norden 's eyes traveled down the narrow room , past the three double-tiered bunks that stood shadowed along each wall , and the desk , in the circle of yellow light the lamp threw , then around to the doorway opening into the other partition , in which stood a wash basin , a steel cabinet , and the latrine . " The second sack on the right is empty , " he said . " Put your gear in the footlocker right next to it . " He looked at the medical summary sheet in his hand , and the provisional diagnosis the interne in the Receiving Ward had scrawled , " D.U. , Mental Observation . " " There 'll be a doctor around in the morning , " he added . The prisoner mumbled something and walked to the bed Norden had pointed out . He took his hat and his neckerchief off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he put them all carefully into the locker and sat down heavily on the bed . After a while he put his head in his hands . Norden went back to his desk . Darkness and silence seemed to hang over the hospital around him ; he felt dead-tired , but with a sick , restless fatigue that would not let him relax . He had stood watch the night before and gone straight out on liberty , so that he had only managed three hours of sleep before coming back on duty . Sleepy , he thought . Jumpy . I should have got some sleep today . Three months is a long time on night duty . He picked up his pen and for a moment stared , unseeing , at the man 's admission sheet before him . Then he flipped the page over and wrote slowly , " 0300 , Received , locked ward . " The pen wavered as he wrote , and the words were strange to him before he had finished . Setting the pen down , he caught himself swaying over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to him that he had sat so , in that half-conscious state , for hours . But the guard outside was motionless on his bench , and the prisoner had not moved . Tired , he thought stupidly . Groggy . Too little sleep today . A muscle twitched in his right eye , and he set his hands down hard on the desk . Snap out of it , he thought sharply . Four more hours . Walk around , he thought . Get up . Do n't let yourself crap out . He lifted himself from the desk and his hand groped in his pocket for the key to the medical locker . The door to the other partition was only three steps away , and Norden felt better when he had snapped the light on there . The thirty-watt bulb hung , unshaded , from the ceiling , and the light it cast was harsh and at the same time weak  --  but it was light . Things were always better in the light . Mechanically , he opened the locker and folded a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to move over the contents of the locker , checking . A row of bottles stood on the top shelf , Merthiolate , A.P.C . ' s , Sulfa . Three new razor-blades , still in their paper wrappings , had been piled neatly next to a safety razor in the corner . On the second shelf a folded straitjacket lay by five fresh bed-sheets , and at the bottom of the locker stood a club , a pair of handcuffs , and a bucket . Everything was in order.uNEASINESS surged back in him when he shut the light and moved into the darkness of the other room . His twelve prisoners slept softly and restlessly around him . They had all been sent here because they were offenders against naval law , so that the place was called the hospital brig , but most of them had been diagnosed as mental cases , too , and some of the doctors called it " the locked ward . " The man in the first bunk groaned in his sleep as Norden stood there , and the soft sound of breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped to his side and looked down at him . The man 's name was Garnes , and he had been in the locked ward for a Icing time . He had tried to escape from the detention barracks on Goat Island , and the second time a Marine guard had sent a .45 slug through his back . The bullet came out through his side , but it had passed just over a kidney , and the wound had infected . He lay now in the restless half-sleep of the long bedridden , the corners of his mouth shadowed with a permanent leer of pain . The drainage tube they had put into his wound was clamped shut ; it hung over the bed , and swayed with the movement of his body . A soft odor of decay came from his flesh in the darkness , and as Norden watched he groaned again in his sleep , and shifted his head on the two pillows under him . The drainage was beginning to back up into the wound . Norden knelt and fumbled in the darkness for the clamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a second the metal refused to turn under his hand . Then it opened , and Norden , listening , heard the sick , soft plop of the fluid into the drainage basin . Noiselessly , Games turned his head . " Thanks , Doc , " he said . His big hands were motionless on the blanket , but Nor-den felt the man 's sudden , complete awareness . He was all awake in a moment . Norden grunted . He would have smiled but the effort was too much for him . The skin of his face felt strained and tense . " Sorry I woke you , " he said . Garnes was an old friend . " How you doing ? " " Pretty well , Doc , pretty well . " Games tried to grin . " Wo n't need no more codeine tonight . " " Right , " Norden said . " See you . " He stood up and , for a moment , let the sick feeling wash over him . Then he walked back to his desk . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed an image of himself seated , with his elbows up on the desk and his head pillowed on his arms ; he longed to yield to it . What was there still to do ? Games was all right , the drainage tube was open , and the wound was dressed . Dressed ? Had he dressed it to-night ? The memory of the clotted bandage was in his mind , but had he changed it or only dreamed of changing it ? With an effort , he cleared his head . Of course . At nine o'clock , when he had come on watch . And now , what else ? He looked around at his twelve prisoners sleeping in their narrow room , and then his eyes came to the newcomer , still sitting motionless on his bunk . With a start , he remembered the pajamas folded over his arm . What was the man 's name ? It was on the Summary Sheet the guard had given him , but he had forgotten it . He bent over the desk to look again . Kummer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bed . " Put these on and sack out . " There was no movement from the man , he acted as if he had not heard . The words he had just spoken echoed in Norden 's own head ; it was as if the dark silence of the room had not been broken , and the sentence had only been something he meant to say . Kummer sat in his dirty undershirt and a pair of navy trousers , his unshaven face in his hands . " Snap out of it , mate , " Norden said . " The night OD will be around in half an hour . Better be sacked out when he comes . " This time the man had heard him . He took his head from his hands and looked at Norden . His eyes were blank and savage , and his voice came in a soft , mechanical monotone . " Sure , Doc . Sure . " The words were meaningless , but a sick knot of apprehension gathered in Nor-den 's stomach as he walked back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard it before ? His mind crawled for it down a long tunnel of memories . What had he forgotten ? Then , suddenly , he had it . The voice . It was Talbot 's . That same flat , forgetful timbre , as if the mind had long ago forgotten what the voice was saying . And Talbot had tried to strangle. him . And the man 's voice was Talbot 's . What ' What was it he had forgotten ? Something he had to do . Shave , unshaven , the man was unshaven . A razor ! No , they would have searched him in Receiving . He ca n't . He could n't have . But if they forgot ? He could not keep his mind on what he was thinking , his thoughts jumped at stray shadows in his brain . He lit a cigarette , forcing his hands into movement , his fingers into steadiness . When he turned to toss the match into the wastebasket , he caught for a moment the fixed , glinting eyes of the man on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norden thought . Too jumpy . Getting like the rest of the screws in here . I should relax . The guy 's got his own troubles . I 'm jumpy . Jumpy . Too dark in here . II ARNES lay flat on his back , his hands G spread on the blanket , and tried to return to sleep . He would listen for a while to the faint , regular sound of his wound draining into the metal basin , and then open his eyes to watch the shadow the night corpsman 's lamp threw on the ceiling . By a slow , cautious movement of his body higher on the two pillows , it was possible for him to see down the whole length of the room , but , although he did it during the day , there was nothing to be seen now at all . So he lay and tried to order his mind into sleep , to move it away from that rapt contemplation of his wound , and the pain it gave him , that he knew could drag on for wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his side with a dull , pulsing pain the codeine could not reach , and sent its long fingers of weakness from one end of his big body to the other . His mind alternately strained to free itself of the mist his pain sent up over all his thoughts , and focused itself , in hate and fascination , on it . Games had lived for a long time with his wound . His wound hurt . He was thinking now of the new prisoner . The noise of the SP 's entrance with him had roused Garnes out of his restless almost-sleep , and he remembered the prisoner 's unshaven face mixed with an image that had been half-dream , half-reverie . He had been walking down 64th Street in Chicago in a new gray pin-stripe suit , and nothing had been wrong with his side . So we got another one , he thought . Makes twelve . Now we an even dozen . The twelve apostles , he thought , and wanted to chuckle , but let it go because it would hurt his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the hill like the most of us . Do n't figure he stayed too long , by the look of him . Got ta keep clean , keep your uniform lookin ' good , or they picks you right up . Got a long way to go before he stays out as long as I did , Garnes thought . He wanted to chuckle again . His side was hurting . He eased himself up on the bed an inch or two , and thought , son of a bitch marine . The movement had disturbed his bandage a little , the throbbing increased in his side , and radiated pain . Havin ' a bad night , Games thought . Should be tired , with all that talking and card-playing today . Wish ah could sleep a little . He opened his eyes wide for a moment , and his hand moved restlessly on the blanket . The pharmacist 's mate was in his chair , slumped over his desk . Games thought of asking for another shot of codeine , and dismissed the thought . He had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . Must have been out all day . Do n't want to ask him for no more codeine . Look like I 'm gon na stand his watch right with him , though . He closed his eyes again . Wonder what time is it , he thought , and then , in a sudden rage , goddamn it . Why ca n't ah get some sleep . A noise of motors came to him from the still air outside , over the muffled breathing in the room . Heah comes that goddamn PBY from Oakland , he thought . Man , must be nearly half-past three . The noise of the plane grew , and Games , listening , heard a queer change in the noise of breathing the men made around him . It seemed to come from the far side of the brig , and Garnes , at first , was not quite sure of what it was . Then heplaced it ; a note of sharper , more hurried breathing , that grew louder and louder as the plane approached , and at the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games thought . Came from Morrisson . Malaria again . He wondered if the night corpsman had heard , or if he was asleep there , slumped over in the chair . Ought to maybe wake Doc up , he thought . The Doe 's a good boy . Do n't wan na see him get in no trouble . But Norden had heard . He took his head off the desk and stood up , shaking it as if he were a little dizzy . Then he walked toward Morrisson . T HE plane was coming down again . Morrisson clawed deeper into the bed that was his beach ; noise rattled in his throat . Flat on his stomach , he lay , and clawed , and tried to keep from screaming . The heat lay on him like a fever , his burning head had swollen into a monstrous , weighted target , he felt the sweat start from his arms and legs . No , not again . They would n't machine-gun him again . Get him , he prayed aloud . Shoot him down . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , and Morrisson saw himself stretched out alone on the endless , gleaming white sand . It stretched away behind him as far as the eye could reach , and he crawled forward toward the green edge of the jungle , the only moving thing . There were birds chattering there , and coolness , and shadows . His breath came from him in whistling gasps , and sweat poured into his eyes . He could no longer see . Where was Gunner ? His clothing weighed a ton , he could not fight clear of it , it lay on him and stifled him . He tried to call to Gunner to come and get it off him , but now , when he tried to speak , no words would come . And then the plane came down again , he heard its roaring in his ears for an endless , tortured moment . He sobbed . Gunner ! His hands made soft , plucking motions on the ground ; his hot , soaked head encountered something soft and yielding , and buried itself into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get him , he prayed . Get him , Gunner . Get him . Get him ! The plane was gone . Someone was talking to him . " Easy , boy , " someone was saying . " Take it easy . The plane 's gone . " He heard the words clearly through the floating mist of steam around him ; they echoed over and over in his skull . There was a hand on his shoulder . Where was he now ? He lay in darkness somewhere , his clothes were drenched . Where was the plane ? Or had that been a long time ago , and somewhere else ? Yes , that was over . What had he said ? Had he cried out ? Where was he ? He opened his eyes . That was the night corpsman , standing over him . He was in the brig . The malaria had come back on him . He knew that in a moment his teeth would begin to chatter , and the fever would be on him again . He wanted to shake his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was causing him , but when he raised his head the corpsman had gone . In a moment of clarity , Morrisson raised his head from the damp pillow , and looked around him . There was a new man in the empty bunk diagonally across from his . Wonder what he 's got , he thought , and then he began to shiver . There was a hand under his neck , and someone was lifting his head up off the bed . The pharmacist 's mate had come back ; he held two.atabrine tablets in his hand and said something Morrisson heard only as an indistinguishable murmur . He swallowed the pills from the corpsman 's hand and lay back . His head was shaking , his whole body rattled with the chill . He fought against it with all his strength , and as it ebbed for a moment he watched the corpsman spread another blanket over him , and move back to his desk . The drumming of blood in his ears receded , and his body lay quiet ; he could hear the quiet breathing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stumbled a little when he walked , and his hand was unsteady when he reached for the pen on his desk . Then Morrisson heard the deep rumbling drawl of Games ' voice from the corner ; it startled him , he had thought no one else was awake . " Look like I ai n't gon na get no sleep tonight , " Games was saying . " You lookin ' bad , Doc . Sack out for a while . I 'll wake you up if anythin ' happens . " He did not hear the corpsman answer . A sudden fit of shivering shook his body . He clenched his teeth and summoned all his strength to fight the hot tide of fever in his blood . He clenched the blanket with his two hands , but his mind slipped slowly down into the black mist . Then the roaring rose once more in his ears . The plane was coming back . Nothing else mattered . I N THE bunk across from Morrisson 's , in the deepest shadow of the room , Rosbrough lay awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the certainty that he knew his serial number . He had awakened with the knowledge at Morrisson 's first cry , and a cold core of fear and anger lay in his stomach now . He was a light sleeper , he always had been . He lay unmoving now in his bunk , his eyes almost closed , and pretended to sleep . He was around somewhere , spying on him . Rosbrough had figured it for a long time . He would find him this time . He was close now . You had to wait him out . He lay and thought about why the man was watching him , and his mind turned in slow cunning . For a long time he had only suspected . Now he knew . He had known since that morning . His brother had come to see him today . They had n't let him in . He had been here three weeks , he had bothered nobody , he had kept his mouth shut about the spying . For two weeks the thought of his brother 's visit had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had n't let him in . They must have known what he was thinking . They had been watching him . They wanted to kill him . A bed creaked in the room , and Rosbrough stiffened in his bunk . He felt eyes on him in the dark . The night was alive with watching , hostile shadows . His mind wavered between cold resolution and panic . Who was it ? Which one of the sleepers here was watching him ? Or was it someone else , someone he never saw , or caught a glimpse of only , among the moving shadows in the corner ? It was n't Games , Garnes had a bullet-hole in his side . It was n't Brooks , who slept above him . It was n't Thompson , or the new prisoner , or the corpsman . The corpsman stood his watch at night , and Rosbrough had felt the eyes watching him all day . It might be Morrisson , Morrisson talked in his sleep sometimes . He had heard him . Suddenly the room was too big for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed , naked , helpless under his blankets . He trembled in the bunk , and his eyes darted about the room , seeking the shadows out . He must hide somewhere . He must crawl into a narrow place , too narrow even to turn around , where the eyes could not follow him . He raised himself up from the bed and threw the covers off him . His feet groped under the mattress to find the slippers his brother had sent him , and he pulled his bathrobe from the iron railing of his bunk . Then he stood up , putting it on , and knotted the cord around his waist . The head , he thought . Get into the head . He padded past the corpsman seated at his desk , his eyes blinking in the sudden light of the lamp , and walked on into the head . There it was dark again . He did not touch the switch . Hide , his brain told him . Hide . He could feel the eyes on him still . Groping , bent almost double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barred window over the wash basin threw a patch of diffuse light along the bulkhead . His fingers encountered the side of the steel locker , and he let his breath out , almost inaudibly , in the dark . Slowly , cautiously , he moved the far edge of the locker out of place , until there was a space between it and the wall just wide enough for a man to crouch in . Then he crept around the locker and noiselessly , deliberately , squatted there , his back against the wall , his hands tight on his knees . His eyes moved continually . He was still being watched . The shadows menaced him . He was not safe . A rattle of panic shook his body . N ORDEN sat with his head back and his eyes closed , his body slack in the chair . He was playing a game . He would let his mind slide down a slope of vague , uneasy fantasies , to the very edge of unconsciousness , and then he would recall it . He knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were three more hours to his watch . A train of queer , disjointed images paraded through his drugged , imag.nation ; his mind lay on the verge of nightmare . He had seen Rosbrough go past him into the head ten minutes ago , but it took some time before the fact that he had not returned could struggle to the surface of his thoughts . When it did he rose mechanically , to go and take a look . He was not really worried about Rosbrough , the diagnosis on his health record was Anxiety Neurosis , but the boy had been quiet and cheerful from the time they had brought him into the brig . He worked willingly on the cleaning details , and he was well liked , Norden knew , by the other prisoners . He had been over the hill for three months , but he was the youngest sailor in the place ; the others regarded him as something of a mascot . Norden walked the three steps to the latrine entrance , and noted uneasily that Rosbrough had not switched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes before . He snapped the switch himself . For a moment , in the uncertain light of the one bulb , he thought the room was empty . Then he saw that the locker had been dragged out from the bulkhead , and , taking a step forward into the center of the room , caught sight of Rosbrough crouched on the deck . He was huddled against the wall in an attitude that reminded Norden strangely of a trapped animal , and there was no recognition in his eyes at all . Norden stood watching him for a moment or two , uncertain of how he should proceed . Fatigue clouded his own mind ; he thought vaguely , pityingly , of the stalking shadows that must have been abroad in the other 's . Help him , he thought . I ought to help him . That 's why I 'm here , Of all the men caught in the ratcage of this room I only have the freedom to will my actions . And I must use it to lead these others . I was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Norden said . He kept his voice low , and friendly . " Why do n't you go to bed ? " But how , he thought , how act ? To act required knowledge , and what knowledge did he have here , in this shadow-world ? He could no longer , tonight , distinguish in his own mind what was real from what was illusion . His own mind jumped at shadows . Rosbrough 's eyes were darting over the room . " Do n't bodder me , " he said . His voice was dull , but a tremor of panic ran in it . " You 're gon na catch a cold if you keep sitting there like that , " Norden told him . He put his hand on the boy 's shoulder . Rosbrough shuddered under his touch . His voice came in a half-whisper of fear and suspicion . " What do you want to do to me ? " he said . " Nothing . I 'm on your side . " Norden kept his voice low . " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Rosbrough said . His eyes were never still . " So you wo n't catch pneumonia , " Nor-den said . He waited for a reply , but the boy said nothing . He squatted there between the locker and the wall , caught up in his own world , shivering with apprehension . Norden stood there watching him for a long moment . He could not know what was wrong . The vision of Rosbrough 's imagination was something to which he could never fully attain , and his own exhausted , apprehensive state made thinking difficult . He looked down at his hands and the thought came to him that they were dirty . He moved , almost mechanically , to the wash basin , and began to wash them . Just to be doing something , he thought , but the act gave him a queer , guilty pleasure . " What are you doing that for ? " Rosbrough cried out . His voice was shrill with fear . " Because my hands are dirty , " Norden said . It seemed to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in a dream . He shut the water off and dried his hands on one of the paper towels . " Let 's go to bed now , hunh ? " he said . He must have said it very kindly and persuasively , for Rosbrough gave him a long , steady look , and got up from the deck . His eyes seemed really to be focused for the first time . " You 're right , Doc , " he said . There was a note of conflict in his voice , as if he were arguing rationally with himself . " I 'll get back into bed . seeing things . " He took a step out of the room , and stumbled . He seemed a little dizzy . Nor-den moved forward to help him , and this time Rosbrough did not shudder to be touched . " Never mind , Doc , " he said . " I can make it . " Norden watched him walk back to his bunk , staggering only a little . In a moment he was under his blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise in the room . A vague feeling of unease possessed Norden , as though he had forgotten something that had to be done . I should have talked to him . He walked back to the desk and looked around him at the sleeping room for a moment . Something moved in Kummer 's bunk , as if the new prisoner had glanced at him in the dark , and Norden took a hard look toward him . The flat , dangerous sound of his voice echoed in Norden 's memory , and the vague feeling of menace that had been with him all evening quickened to life again . He did not know if Kummer was awake or not . He did not know of all the men who seemed to sleep around him whether they really slept , or what their thoughts were if they lay awake . He could not even tell if what he feared had any substance ; he no longer knew what was truth here , and what illusion . He glanced at his watch and wished the night OD would come . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second round an hour ago . Norden decided he would tell him about Rosbrough , and let the doctor say if anything should be done . Relief came to him at the thought . He sat down at his desk again and opened the log. " 0400 , " he wrote . " Locked ward secure . " B UT KUMMER lay in the dark unsleep- ing . His thoughts moved in a weary circle around and around his brain . He had not slept since they had brought him in . He lay and watched without curiosity as Rosbrough climbed into his bunk , he did not care why the boy had got out of bed or what had happened in the twenty minutes he had been gone . He caught the corpsman 's eyes on him in the dark , and closed his own . He knew the corpsman was watching him , but he did not care one way or the other , all here were strangers to him . Over , he thought . It 's over . The hiding , the running away , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had jumped ship in Seattle , the round of finding odd jobs and quitting them , the moving from one cheap hotel to another  --  that was all over . He lay in apathy . His life had been a nightmare of suspicion and flight , and now it was over . The SP 's had picked him up . The Navy had him now . They would court-martial him , he was a deserter , he had jumped ship to keep from going out again . Now they would hang a GCM on him and let him rot for years in Portsmouth or some other lousy prison . But he would fool them . It was all over now . He had fought when the SP 's picked him up . He had fought them on the street there , and all the way out to the base , with a wildness born of despair and three months of starting at shadows . But now he was all done fighting . All finished now . Someone muttered in the room . Kummer rolled over slowly on his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been out of bed . The muttering came again , and Kummer caught at the words . " I 'm gon na get that guy , " the kid was saying . " I 'm gon na get him . " T HE corpsman had heard too . Kummer saw him walk up , looking tired and a little dazed . " What 's wrong , Rosbrough ? " the corpsman said . " What 's the matter ? " " I 'm gon na get that guy , " Rosbrough repeated . His eyes were moving wildly again , and there was no recognition in the look he gave the corpsman . He was half out of bed , his arms tense and lifted at his sides . " There 's nobody there , " said the corpsman . " Go back to bed . " Rosbrough was standing now . He looked sharply , coldly , around the room , and then bent suddenly to peer under his bunk . " I 'll get him , " he said . " I 'll get him now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching from across the aisle , saw him peer sharply , twice , behind it . The guy 's nuts , he thought . He 's liable to hurt somebody . The corpsman was holding him now . " Take it easy , " he was saying . " There 's nobody there , Jess . Go back to bed . " But Rosbrough would not listen . He pointed suddenly to the bunk next to his , where Morrisson lay sleeping . " Who 's that ? " he said . " Who 's that ? " " That 's Morrisson , " the corpsman said . " Leave him alone , he 's got malaria . Get back in your sack . " Rosbrough threw another look behind the radiator . He said , " I 'm gon na get that guy , " and then , suddenly , without warning , he threw himself on Morrisson . His hands were on the man 's throat , and there was a look of insane release on his face . Morrisson woke in terror , crying out . The corpsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Rosbrough had been given strength somewhere , his arms bored down on Morris-son 's throat with maniacal intensity . His breath came in gasps of fury . Kummer. watching , felt his interest flare up for a moment . He felt his dulled mind being tugged to act . Somebody might get hurt , he thought . The corpsman needs some help . He got up slowly , woodenly , from his bunk . Then , with sudden decision , he threw himself into the swaying shape of struggle . He had his hand on one of Rosbrough 's arms ; he pulled with all his strength , and the arm came away from Morrisson 's throat . Then the corpsman broke his other arm clear , and they pulled him , wrestling , into the center of the room . He was sobbing now . He fought with a concentrated fury it had not seemed possible for his frail body to possess . For a moment , the three stood swaying together between the two lines of bunks , and Kummer caught the corpsman staring at him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked relieved , Kummer thought . They were all breathing heavily . " Thanks , " the corpsman said . He had Rosbrough pinned to the deck , a knee in his back . In the struggle , they had knocked his robe off the bed . It lay on the deck now , and Kummer bent to pick it up . The corpsman glanced around him . " Look , mate , " he said . " Go wake the guard up out there , will you ? " But Kummer 's attention was centered on the robe . He had picked it up by its sash , and he held that in his hands , a four-foot length of woven cotton belt . The mood of despairing apathy had settled back on him . His mind turned slowly on the thing in his hand , and he did not hear what the other said . There was no need , though , to call the guard . They both heard the grating sound of the key in the lock , and then his hand shoved the door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking sleepy and rattled , and then the night OD stormed past him . It was a doctor Norden had worked with in Surgery , a big lieutenant named Burrell . Kummer heard him greet the corpsman , but he had lost interest in what was happening to these others . He walked toward the head slowly , carrying the bathrobe . III ARNES lay on his bunk and watched the scene with interest . His wound had stopped draining but the pain was with him like an old friend , he was glad something was going on to take his mind away from it . Doc havin ' a busy night for sure , he thought . New guy come in and Morrisson thinkin ' he in an air-raid , and now this kid here blowin ' his top . " All right , " he heard the doctor say . " What 's wrong here , Norden ? " His voice was loud . It sounded angry , but pitched a little too high , as if the doctor were afraid he would not really know even if Norden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , he thought . We in for trouble now . He listened to Norden , still holding Rosbrough on the deck , as he told the doctor what had happened . But the OD did not let him finish . " He 's faking , " he said loudly . " Let him up . " The pharmacist 's mate released his grip obediently . Rosbrough did not move . He lay tense on the deck , his eyes wild , breathing hard . " On your feet , sailor , " the OD told him . He put his arm under Rosbrough 's shoulder and heaved him upright . " Do n't touch me , " Rosbrough said wildly . " Do n't touch me . " He seemed hardly to see the doctor at all . " Say sir when you talk to me , " the doctor said loudly . " And get your goddamn feet together . " His voice sounded surer of itself now . " You 're a prisoner , sailor . Remember it . " Games , listening in his bunk , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corpsman staring at the doctor , and the quick look of distrust that had gathered in his eyes . Doc ai n't so glad to see him any more , he thought . His hands lay clenched under the blanket . He thought , try that on me , you son of a bitch . The doctor was still talking . " Sailor , " he was saying , " if there 's anything I hate , it 's a fake . And you 're not fooling me at all . " Rosbrough 's eyes were focused on him now . The words had penetrated . " I got ta get him , sir , " he said quickly . His voice was urgent . Then his eyes broke and began to ferret the room again . " I got ta get him . " " Do n't give me any of that , sailor , " the doctor said . He had worked himself into a real rage now . " I know your kind . " He turned to the corpsman , and thought for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Rosbrough had caught at the word . " No , " he said . " No you do n't . " " Keep your mouth shut , " the doctor said . " And quit faking that psycho act before I throw you in a straitjacket . " " I got ta get him , " Rosbrough said . " I told you , sir . " " Shut up , " the doctor said . He stepped toward Rosbrough , and Games saw him shove the boy backward toward the wall . " I told you once . " For a moment Rosbrough stood motionless . Then the inhuman look came back into his eyes , and , without warning , he leaped toward the doctor . The corpsman and the guard were on him in a moment . The guard slapped him down , hard , on the deck . He lay there , his head twisted to look up at the doctor . making a savage , animal noise in his throat . His eyes were filled with hate . Then they had him on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You asked for it . " He took a step toward Rosbrough again . But this time the corpsman intervened . He moved his body so that he stood between the two , and Games could see disgust mixed with the fatigue in his eyes as he turned to the OD . " I 'll take care of him , doctor , " he said . " I think I can quiet him down . " The doctor looked at him for a moment . " No , " he said . " We 'll put him in a straitjacket . That sailor needs to be taught a lesson . " He moved toward the door , containing his rage . " I 'll bring one in right now . Do n't let him move a muscle till I get back . " Games watched through a red mist of anger as the doctor strode toward the door . His side was throbbing painfully , he wanted to get up , to seize the doctor by the throat and tell him what he thought of him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move his body . His eyes moved around the room . Ai n't one of these yardbirds gon na read him off ? he thought . The other prisoners lay in their bunks , unmoving ; it was impossible to tell if they were awake or not . Then Games ' eyes moved toward the head . From where he lay he could see diagonally into it , past the shadowed door and into the corner where a shower had been rigged up . Something white moved in the darkness there . Games stared from his bunk . A belt , he thought , it was a belt . Someone had hung it from the iron cross-rod set into the concrete of the shower partition . What 's goin ' on ? Games thought . . His eyes bored into the darkness ; there was someone in there , he was moving a chair . And then Games had it . Kummer had gone in there a minute ago . The new one , Games thought , and then his mind reeled in recognition . Mother , he whispered . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for action . Garnes knew he had to get out of bed and dive at the man , pull him away from that white , gleaming rope . His legs were tensed to spring , he started to move , and then the pain shot outward through his body from his side . He had forgotten ; he was crippled . He gathered all his strength into his voice then . " Doe , " he yelled . " In the head ! In the head ! " He had meant it for the corpsman , but the doctor turned , startled , at the door . He looked where Games was pointing , and then the urgency in the cry galvanized him into action . But it was too late . Games heard the sickening sound of the chair being kicked away , and a shadow on the wall of the head swayed gently from side to side . He cursed his wound and his slowness . N ORDEN felt as though the fog he had been moving in all night had thickened suddenly around him . He heard Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved with drunken haste toward the latrine . His mind was a confusion of vague , formless thoughts . So it had happened , he thought . The nameless catastrophe he had fought off all evening and known . would come , had come . And he was guilty . The doctor had cut Kummer down , and was stooped over him as Norden entered . Confronted by a purely medical problem , he had regained his sureness , he moved with speed and energy . Norden stood watching the scene as if through a mist . The doctor had stretched Kummer out on his stomach and was beginning artificial respiration , he spoke aloud , half to Norden , half to himself . " Neck 's not broken , " he said . " Strangulation . " The words came clearly to Norden 's ears , but as if from a great distance , the scene seemed frozen , like a tableau . He heard the doctor send the guard out to phone Receiving for a pulmotor , and then begin to work on Kummer . Norden made an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence in his mind and found it hard to form the words . Then he heard his own voice asking the doctor if he wanted any help . The doctor looked up at him for a moment , and his eyes were keen again , as Norden remembered them in Surgery . He seemed really to look at Norden for the first time that evening , and Norden caught himself swaying as he stood there looking back . " Go and sit down , Norden , " the doctor said . " You 're out on your feet . " Then the door opened , and it seemed suddenly as if the room were full of people . There was another doctor , and a nurse , and three of the corpsmen from Receiving . They were making noise , and Norden found himself thinking for a moment that he should tell them to be quiet , his prisoners were sleeping in the room . Then he decided it did not matter , and the thought lost itself in his mind . He walked back heavily and sat down at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all evening welled up again , and he let it wash over his mind . There was no more watch to stand . There was no need any more to fight his tiredness and to stand guard at the gates of his mind trying to distinguish , of the shadows that flocked by , which were real and which the creation of his own sick fancy . No need , any more , to tremble because truth and illusion looked alike to him . He closed his eyes and eased his body down in the chair . His face felt strained . He passed his hand over it once , tiredly . His hand felt dirty to the skin . Ought to wash up , he thought . Or have I washed them once already ? He did not know , his mind stumbled around the problem . Did wash them then , or only think of washing them ? No sense , now , anyhow . His mind slipped back to Kummer , and the way he had looked when the guard brought him in . I thought then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he helped me there , I thought he was all right . Two times wrong . I guessed wrong twice . I could have saved him if I 'd kept my eyes on him . But how ? I could n't watch them all . His thoughts strayed . There were shadows in his mind . They act as they must , he thought confusedly . I can not know what all of them are thinking . I can never tell truth from illusion in this shadow-world . His mind cast up an image of Rosbrough crouched on his haunches in the dark , his eyes always moving , looking for something . And Morrisson , flung out , sweating , on his bed , hearing the plane come down again , and the roar of its engines . Truth and illusion . He had done what he could . And he had waited for the doctor . He had waited for the man with knowledge and with quick , sure hands , the man who stayed outside the shadowed brig , and who would know how to tell truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor had not known . What went on here was more strange to him than to Norden , and harder for him to grasp . Perhaps Garnes knew . Garnes had been here a long time , and did not sleep at night . Yes . Maybe Games knew . But Games had an infected bullet-hole in his side ; he could not move . Norden 's head nodded on his chest , he knew he was near sleep . His mind drifted , borne on vagrant , phantom images . T HEN it seemed to him that something was coming toward him ; he heard its heavy footsteps at his back . He thought at first it was the doctor , but he was walking in a long tunnel , and the noise of feet echoed from the walls . He turned to look behind him , but there was no one to be seen , and his heart pounded with vague , heavy fear . It could not be the doctor , The tunnel was empty ; he was alone . But the noise of feet grew louder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strength , but the tunnel was pitch-black , he could not see his body under him , or whether he was running at all . The noise of feet grew and came nearer , it was a steady , monstrous beat . He turned to face it , desperately , and the noise was gone ; Rosbrough 's eyes , savage and bright , like an animal 's , looked at him from the darkness . A slow snarl started in the shadows ; it grew into a rustling murmur , and the eyes multiplied all around him . Someone was reading charges against him , but he could not make out the words ; they came to his ears in a harsh , threatening , familiar murmur , just beyond understanding . The beasts stood all around him , with Rosbrough 's eyes , and Norden stood in terror and knew that he was guilty . He called to Games to come and help him , but Garnes lay there with his wound draining in the dark , and could not lift himself from his bunk . He pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and smiled , and nodded .
