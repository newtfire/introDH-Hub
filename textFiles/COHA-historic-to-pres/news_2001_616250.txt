Child 's death not DFCS 's mistake <p> Let me get this straight . Art Geter notices stomach-turning burns and wounds on a 14-month-old child ( " Slain toddler 's kin : DFCS is to blame , " Metro , July 10 ) . One burn runs from her knee to her hip , another looks like an iron  --  an iron  --  on her little tummy and deep wounds appear on her wrists as if she 'd been tied up . <p> Geter sees these nightmarish injuries on a baby still in diapers and he considers calling the police , but he does n't . He worries the police might take the baby away from his son and the child 's mother . He does , however , swallow a tale blaming relatives for the torture . Instead of insisting the child be taken to a hospital , Geter calls the Douglas County Department of Family and Children Services to pass on an accusation . <p> So little Crystal Langley , barely old enough to talk but surely able to scream , endures another two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death , allegedly by Geter 's son , Mark Geter . The blame , says Art Geter , is on DFCS . What an astonishing delusion . <p> It is ironic that on this same day , the paper ran an article about the cruelty of the electric chair . The electric chair beats cigarettes and irons any day of the week . Just ask Crystal . DIANNA EDWARDS , Marietta <p> Condit forgot good advice he gave to Bill Clinton <p> By now everyone knows that Rep. Gary Condit ( D-Calif. ) lied about his affair with Chandra Levy . And for that he should be scrutinized to the fullest until this young woman is found . When Bill Clinton was embroiled in a similar controversy not too long ago , Condit implored him to lay out all of the facts so that Congress could decide how to move forward with the case . Condit himself could have benefited from the same advice . But just like the former president , he too was trying to save face , only in his case a young woman is missing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about one aspect of this case . Why did Levy 's aunt wait to fully disclose that her niece and the congressman were having an affair ? Had she spoken out earlier , I wonder whether the police would have aggressively sought a warrant to search the congressman 's apartment instead of doing it just now . KATE PEABODY , Gainesville <p> Morris brought ethics to Atlanta finance panel <p> While Lee Morris is indeed irreplaceable as chair of the finance committee , I feel that your assessment in a recent article ( " Atlanta council 's fiscal guru wo n't seek re-election , " News , July 10 ) of his influence overlooked a perhaps even more valuable contribution : his removal of the " For Sale " sign that had been hung on the office door by his predecessor . HOWARD SHOOK , Atlanta <p> SALVATION ARMY Organization not acting Christ-like <p> The Salvation Army 's deal to secure the Bush administration 's support of its anti-gay policies is disgusting ( " Anti-gay deal on charity hiring alleged between White House , Salvation Army , " News , July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lesbians chews away at its theological fabric . <p> Golly , I thought the Salvation Army was about caring for people and that its theological fabric was the love and compassion of Christ . If that 's not the case , then the fabric is threadbare and deserves to be rejected . Salvation Army staffers can ring their little bells till the cows come home , but I 'll never contribute another cent to these uniformed bigots and their warped Christian values . MALCOLM CRAIG , Marietta <p> Churches single out homosexual behavior <p> The Salvation Army 's attempted deal with the White House to have faith-based organizations exempted from fair hiring practices aptly displays the hypocrisy of such organizations . Many homosexuals are active in religion , and they alone are singled out among the " faithful " sinners who populate religious organizations . After all , evangelical churches have employed convicted embezzlers as leaders although their Bible says clearly , " Thou shalt not steal . " Religious organizations and their affiliates will welcome and " forgive " just about anything except homosexuality , but to the homosexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept your money . G.M. HILL , Marietta <p> Whites unaware of what blacks live with daily <p> The most surprising aspect about the results of the latest Gallup poll on the widening gap between perceptions of blacks and whites is that anyone would find it surprising ( " Poll : Racial split widens , " News , July 11 ) . As a black man , my views about America are shaped by my treatment in America . My personal experiences of racial profiling on several occasions behind a steering wheel in Marietta , for example , allow me to see this country from a different perspective . <p> White privilege is a social blindfold that allows most whites to go through their day oblivious to the humiliation and disrespect meted out to minorities around them on a daily basis . When we complain , we 're accused of harboring a victim mentality . I submit that a victim mentality is based on experienced victimization in a country mired in institutionalized racism . RICHARD KENYADA , Lithonia <p> Randall showed herself to be bigoted , irrational <p> I hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Margaret Mitchell House on Thursday ( " Author stirs harsh ' Wind ' in Tara land , " Living , July 13 ) . <p> Randall 's conduct shows that she is bigoted and irrational . She apparently did not want to allow audience members with different viewpoints to speak during the question-and-answer session . Instead , she shouted them down . <p> One wonders what Randall meant when she screamed " My own mother was damaged by this book and has all kinds of problems with racial identity . " <p> The strident Randall is obviously the one with the problems . JOE BAGGETT , Douglasville <p> Georgia leads way on merit-based scholarships <p> The recent column about merit-based college scholarships got my full attention ( " Help good students avoid heavy debts , " New Attitudes , July 9 ) . <p> It saddens me to know that an out-of-state student must incur a $17,000 debt to attend one of Georgia 's fine institutions of higher education . The fact that the student loan interest rate has dropped to 5.99 percent , the lowest since 1967 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for more merit-based scholarships pass without stating that Georgia is No. 1 in state-financed merit-based scholarships and has been No. 1 for four straight years . The fourth-year ranking is based on the 1999-2000 academic year when Georgia awarded $240.5 million in aid to students that was not based on family income . Georgia 's ranking is attributed to our HOPE scholarship program , which is funded by the Georgia Lottery for Education . <p> For the talented young columnist , who no doubt will be successful despite any financial obstacle , and other outstanding students like her , I suggest a visit to our Web site , www.gsfc.org . Once there , click on " Links . " There , we provide access to two well-known sites that provide private scholarships to outstanding students . GLENN NEWSOME Newsome is executive director of the Georgia Student Finance Commission . <p> Maybe it was dogs who tamed humans <p> Reporter John Head writes that dogs became the first domesticated animals 12,000 to 15,000 years ago , when humans tamed wolves ( " Cats or Dogs ? " Living , July 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors of dogs initiated the relationship with humans by hanging around our camps for scraps of food . <p> If this theory is correct , there is a sense in which dogs domesticated or tamed us . DENISE NOE , Atlanta <p> WORKING POOR Poor should n't have kids they ca n't afford <p> A recent editorial states that a chief reason for Georgia 's children living in poverty is that the parents are n't able to earn enough to support them ( " Working poor deserve wages above poverty line , " July 12 ) . <p> Could the problem ( and perhaps the solution ) involve these same parents , many of whom have children they ca n't afford to support ? <p> More responsibility by this group would benefit all concerned  --  not only children facing a life of poverty , but the rest of us expected to pay for the uncaring actions of others . PETER C. MATTHES , Roswell <p> Do n't glorify single parenthood <p> I have at least two problems with the editorial about the working poor . First , the Constitution should stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both parents raising these toddlers . <p> It takes a lot of resources and nurturing to raise children , and in the majority of cases , one parent can not provide both . The purpose of marriage is to provide an atmosphere of commitment and devotion from both parents to raise children to adulthood . One parent can primarily provide the resources , while the other basically provides the nurturing . <p> It is a very workable , time-proven arrangement . <p> The second problem is that the Constitution failed to mention the contribution to the total income from child-support payments . This will swell the amount for most , even single mothers , above the poverty line . <p> When you take child support payments into account , the numbers below the poverty line decrease significantly .
