( See Front Cover ) There are 6,000 golf courses in the U. S. , 2,000 in the British Empire , only 1,000 in the rest of the world . Because two-thirds of the world 's golf is played on U. S. soil , it is not surprising that U. S. golfers have the reputation of being the world 's best . <P> It was not always so . At the turn of the Century , when the first rule of U. S. golf was to purchase a $40 scarlet coat with brass buttons , golf was the pastime of the " 400 . " Its players were not only kidded on the vaudeville stage , but scorned by the more experienced , less gaudy British . In 1913 , however , when an obscure 20-year-old Bostonian named Francis Ouimet beat Britain 's famed barnstorming professionals , Harry Vardon and Ted Ray , for the U. S. Open championship , Great Britain began to raise her eyebrows . And in 1922 , after an amazing crop of young golfers had sprouted up all over the U. S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by St. Louis Stockbroker George H. Walker. * to determine whether U. S. or British golfers played better golf . <P> Last week most of the 2,000.000 U. S. amateur golfers , 90% of whom can not break 90 consistently , were reading with vicarious thrills the news of the nine Americans chosen to represent them in the tenth series of Walker Cup matches . +still the No. 1 international event , played this week at famed St. Andrews on the Scottish coast . All golf enthusiasts are well aware that the nearest Great Britain has ever come to putting a dent in the Walker Cup was in 1932 at Brookline , when Briton Leonard Crawley hooked an iron shot to the spot where the big silver trophy was on display , knocked it off its pedestal . This year , however , Britons were talking about the " ascendancy of British amateur golf , " were hoping for their first victory in ten tries . <P> British Hope . What had given them newborn hope was the discovery of an 18-year-old Irish schoolboy , James Bruen , who skyrocketed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Walker Cup trials , when he equaled famed Bobby Jones 's amateur record of 68 for the championship course at St. Andrews . His total for four rounds ( 68 , 71 , 71 , 72 ) was three strokes better than the score Bobby Jones registered to win the 1927 British Open on that course-a total good enough to have won any championship ever played at ancient St. Andrews . Hailed as the greatest discovery since Jones , Jim Bruen , who weighs 200 Ib. and can make an eagle 3 look simple on a 530-yd. hole , was promptly named on the British Walker Cup team the day before his 18th birthday-along with five Englishmen , two Scots .
