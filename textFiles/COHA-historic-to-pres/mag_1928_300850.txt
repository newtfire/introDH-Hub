The Treaty of Nettuno between Italy and Jugoslavia was ratified by the Belgrade Parliament last week . The Treaty tends to facilitate possible Italian encroachments upon the Jugoslav province of Croatia . Therefore Croatian Deputies blocked its ratification until their leader , Stefan Raditch , was assassinated in Parliament by a Government Deputy ( TIME , July 2 , Aug. 20 ) . Few will deny that the Treaty of Nettuno was put through secondarily by assassination and primarily as the result of threats and pressure upon the Jugoslavian Government by His Excellency Benito Mussolini .
