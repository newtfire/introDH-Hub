Tancred At whose suggestion , dare you thus intrude your unasked counsel  --  your impertinent advice ?  --  Odo . Odo At whose suggestion prithee  --  ask you that ?  --  At the suggestion , of mine honest heart  --  shall I stand by , and see my master tilt at a brave Knight , because a Turban 'd Turk hath kill 'd himself , and his pet bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who poisoned the Sultana !  --  fellow speak  --  speak without riddle as you value life ?  --  Odo . Odo That I am not at liberty to tell  --  if you will bring the witness I shall name  --  he may , or may not , solve the mystery  --  this I do know  --  I made her coffee  --  and I saw her drink it  --  but whether it were poisonous or no , depends upon the Bush on which it grew , or the false Turk , who sold it to my master .  --  God . Godfrey Bind the intruder Guards , and bear him to the Torture .  --  ( Guards seize Odo and are about to bind him . ) Odo . Odo Stop , not so fast my friends  --  it will save you a world of trouble , and myself some pain , if you will just step to the Guard-room , and bring my brother Hafez here , whom you will find in Irons  --  here 's the Key .  --  Ver . Hugh Odo , this is no quibbling prank I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of tune .  --  Odo . Odo I fear it will turn out a sorry joke for Hafez.  --  Ver . Hugh Guards bring the prisoner , whom he told you of .  --  ( The guards go out bring in Hafez chained  --  Hafez kneels down as a condemned criminal . ) Hafez . Hafez I do confess my crime , and beg for mercy  --  the sultan did beguile me to the act  --  ' t was innocently done , indeed it was  --  I did not dream of poison , my good Lords  --  he did assure me ' t was a pleasant trick  --  I could not think he 'd murder his own wife  --  until he kill 'd himself .  --  God . Godfrey Your Master had no knowledge of the fact ?  --  Haf . Hafez None as I hope for mercy .  --  Odo . Odo Nor your brother Odo ?  --  Haf . Hafez None as I am a Sinner.  --  Alex . Alexius Tancred give me your hand  --  I here protest , In hearing , and in presence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will perform the vow which I have made .  --  God . Godfrey Let us prepare for battle with the foe  --  Before the morning 's Sun beams oe'r the hills , Shall gild the towers of proud Antioch , Or chase the shadows from Orontes wave ; The City shall be ours , my good friends .  --  Odo . Odo ( To Tancred . ) ' T were pity Sir , that this good company , should go away disappointed of the show  --  with your good leave , i 'll take a Tilting match with Count Raymond 's Squire , or my brother Hafez here .  --  Tan . Tancred Peace idle fool  --  you shall have work tomorrow .  --  Scene II . Before the walls of Anticoh  --  Time , an hour before daylight  --  Odo is seen kicking about , and examining , he scull  --  , bones , and other parts of skeletons , which lay strcw 'd upon the ground  --  he appears to be collecting Specimens .  --  Odo . Odo Of all the Schools for the study of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It affords such facility for the collection of good subjects to the Professor , that we are at no loss for a Specimen , which shall fully develope the prominent passion , of the fool who wore the Head whilst living .  --  Then too we have the Craniums of Christians , Jews , Saracens , Turks , Infidels , Moslems , believers and unbelievers , male and female , of all ages , sexes and conditions  --  for your famine is no respecter of persons , and our Christian swords , do not wait to discuss conditions and degrees .  --  Now from the swelling of the perecordium , ( pointing to a skeleton on the ground ) I should prophecy , that poor love-sick girl , died in the act of sharing her last biscuit , with her Soldier in the trenches.  --  This fellow 's Scull is not fractured  --  but from the region of Cowardice , I perceive he died without a wound , from the whistling of a Christian Javelin about his ears .  --  This scull ( holding it up ) belonged to a Theorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fancied that the earth was hollow , and that the Shell was composed of Lamina like the coats of an onion .  --  But if I stand here discussing marrow-bones , instead of reconnoitring the enemies fortifications , my master will explore the region of insubordination , if I chance to have such a bump upon my Cranium .  --  ( Walks about on tiptoe , examining the walls and Towers  --  spies Phirouz the Traitor , on the wall . ) Hah  --  who have we here ?  --  Good morning to you Sir  --  we have a cool air springing up this morning  --  no harm to perambulate the grounds a little I hope , provided we keep on the right side of the enclosures ?  --  Phi . Phirouz What is the object of your early visit fellow , to this place ? Odo . Odo Nothing very particular Sir  --  I was only soliloquising a little , in the valley of dry bones .  --  Phi . Phirouz To whose Standard are you attached fellow , I see you wear the Armour of a Christian Soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the Armour of the Prince of Tarento .  --  Any thing to say against that Legion ?  --  Phi . Phirouz No.  --  The hour has arrived , at which your Leader promised to be here , to adjust the preliminaries of a secret service , which he is about to undertake .  --  Odo . Odo ( In a low voice . ) My Master on a secret expedition .  --  Then as he chose not to communicate it to Odo  --  Odo had better retire from the place of negotiation .  --  I bid you a good morrow , Mr. Truk.  --  ( going ) Phi . Phirouz Hark'e fellow  --  As your Master may have need of your services on the coming occasion , if you should happen to be stationed at the outer Gate there , let not a Turban pass you from within here , at the risk of your life .  --  Odo . Odo Oho , is that what your upon ?  --  very good Sir  --  I will endeavour for once in my life , to serve two Masters .  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Battlements  --  enter to him Bohemond . Phi . Phirouz An hour hence , my guard will be relieved ,  --  Our secret compact must be carried into effect within the hour , or it will be too late .  --  Boh . Bohemond My trusty confidants are all equipp 'd , and now await my orders .  --  Do we enter at the Gate , or scale the ramparts ?  --  Phi . Phirouz By no means must the gate be stormed , or opened from without .  --  The noise will alarm the sleeping Soldiery , and our plan will in a moment be frustrated .  --  Station a tried and trusty Soldier at the Gate , with orders to put to death , all who shall attempt a sally from that quarter .  --  Your choicest followers , must ascend the walls with you , and first secure the relief Guard , ( whom I shall point out to them ) who are now refreshing themselves with an hour 's slumber  --  We will then set fire to the Citadel , and whilst confusion rages , open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bohemond I will return upon the instant , with my band .  --  ( Exit Bohemond . ) Bohemond enters with his followers  --  and stations Odo at the Gate  --  he then ascends , by means of a rope ladder , which Phirouz lets down to him  --  as he plants his standard on the Battlements , he finds the Standard of Count Raymond already floating there  --  some three or four of his band follow him , and having murdered the sleeping Guard within , they set fire to the Citadel  --  Bohemond meets Raymond on the Battlements , where their respective Standards are planted . Boh . Bohemond Now by the faith of Knighthood , this is a double Treachery .  --  He tears up Raymond 's Standard , and tramples , it under his feet . Now Raymond Count of Thoulouse , I redeem my Gage.  --  we fight for Antioch , and Chivalry 's bright Star .  --  They fight , and Bohemond hurls him from the Battlements , mortally wounded  --  As he falls Tancred enters , and whilst he is contemplating Raymond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seeing Raymond slain , and Tancred standing over him , is convinced that Tancred is in the plot with Bohemond , and has kill 'd Count Raymond . Alex . Alexius Draw Stripling and defend yourself .  --  Tancred draws reluctantly  --  they fight  --  Tancred disarms the Emperour.  --  At this moment , Phirouz the Traitor , opens the Gate and rushes out , when Odo kills him with a Spear . Odo . Odo I always obey orders .  --  FINIS .
