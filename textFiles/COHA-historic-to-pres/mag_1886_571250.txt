ARTICLE 111. - THE SERVICES CAPITAL RENDERS TO LABOR . JUST now , questions of the possible and rightful relations of capital to labor are receiving much attention . Every one admits their very great iniportance and difficulty . It has therefore seemed to the writer a fit time to offer a few remarks upon some of the necessary relations of the two , relations which must necessarily be understood and taken into account in trying to answer the above questions . Besides land , labor and capital are the factors in the production of wealth . By productive labor is meant labor devoted directly to producing wealth . The labor of merchants and carriers is productive , because production means putting the materials which nature furnishes into a condition for use , which includes bringing them to the place where they are wanted . Unproductive labor is no less honorable and useful than productive . To call the labor of a teacher or a physician unproductive , is not , as some have thought , to " stigmatize " it . Indeed , it is often unproductive labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By wealth is here meant material things produced by labor and adapted to gratify human desires . Such adaptation is called utility . It does not matter for this definition whether the desire is noble or depraved , or whether its gratification is wise or foolish . Whiskey has utility as truly as bread . Labor itself , or the capacity to labor , or credit , is often called wealth , but the word will not be so used in this article . The things which constitute wealth are sometimes capable of being used to gratify human desires-that is , in economical language , consumed-directly , as are two heads of raw materials and instruments . Pig iron or wool , steam-engines or plows , are of no direct use to any one ; they are valuable only for what can be made // out of them or by means of them. * Money , too , is a mere instrument of exchange , that is , of production ; no one but a miser cares for it for its own sake . Wealth of the former kind I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief function being to sustain life ; and the latter sort , " inchoate wealth , " it being , as will appear further on , of the nature of unfinished products . The end of labor , the purpose for which it is undergone , is to get sustenance wealth . The real wages of the laborer consists in the amount of wealth in this form which he receives for his services.t Until he gets this he practically gets nothing . If he is paid in money , for instance , that is not his actual wages but only a means of getting them . It is like being paid in store orders , except that money is equivalent to a general order good at any store . The same is true of profits , which are the reward which the owner of capital employed in production receives for its use . It follows therefore that an industrial process can only be considered complete , when it has resulted in the production of this sort of wealth . Any process that only yields inchoate wealth , such as shipbuilding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a very important sense , an incomplete , partial or subordinate process , since it has not yet brought forth any thing useful pei* *e , fitted to become wages . The only function of capital , the only aid it lends to labor in the production of wealth , if we consider complete industrial processes , is to enable the laborer to wait longer before he realizes the result of his labor in sustenance wealth , to carry on longer processes of production . He works to get the means to supply his wants ; capital steps in and furnishes the * This statement must be taken with some qualifications . An article may have in the main only an indirect utility , and yet be capable of certain limited direct uses . But it is nearly enough true for our present purposes .

It is impossible , in the limited space at my command , to always notice exceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good sense of the reader . t The word wages in political economy does not imply any hiring of labor . It means the reward of the laborer , whether he work for hlr&amp; or on his own account . // supplies while the work is doing . Were it not for capital , every industrial process would have to be short enongh to be begun and ended in the interval between the times when its products were needed , for instance , between breakfast and dinner . But why should laborers care to wait longer ; what is the advantage of long processes over short ones ? Why would it not be just as well to carry on several short processes in the same time that one long one would take , so the same amount of work was done ? The answer is found in what may be called the cumulative efficiency of labor . Experience has shown that a long industrial process will yield a larger proportional return than a short one ; that , for instance , to give ten days ' work to one job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of ten smaller jobs . It is rather hard to get clearly hold of this idea in the conditions of our life , because we have no complete short industrial processes of any importance . Those are only found among people in a low stage of civilization . If a man goes hunting to get his family a dinner , although the actual hunting may be done between two meal-times , he uses a gun that was made by a long and complicated series of previous efforts ; and a part of . the labor of every person who helped make the gun , or its materials , or the tools with which it was made , or the materials or tools with which those tools were made , enters into the industrial process that is complete when the game  --  a portion of sustenance wealth-is brought home by the hunter . But suppose a shipwrecked sailor cast ashore some morning upon an uninhabited island , stripped bare of everything , except that for decorum 's sake we may allow him a suit of clothes ; a man alone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor as a knife or a fish-hook . He begins to labor , he commences an industrial process , to get himself a dinner ; and that process must be complete , must result in the production of wealth in the form of sustenance wealth , by dinner time , or at least by the end of such period as he can go without food . He perhaps sees plenty of birds and beasts which he could easily capture if he had time to make a bow and arrow , or a trap . But weapons and traps are inchoate wealth merely , not real wages , and he must have his wages , // the real and final reward of his labor , at once . So he probably goes to work picking up shell-fish or searching for wild vegetables or fruits . If these are so scarce that all his time is taken up in collecting just enough to live on , he may not be able at all to better his condition . But some day he makes a lucky find of provisions washed up from the wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other supply that will last him two or three days . Now he has capital . He may spend the time while these provisions last in making himself a bow and arrows , traps or fishing appliances of some kind . Now his industrial processes have become longer and at the same time more productive . If after breakfast he goes out and shoots game for his dinner , the process is no longer begun and finished between the two meals . It was begun when he began to make his archer 's tools , and it is only a part , and that the smaller part , which is carried on at the time of the shooting . And he will probably get enough game in that time to last him all day , so that he will not need to hunt in the afternoon at all . Being able to supply his immediate wants with less labor , that is , his labor being now more productive , he gets time to spare for other things , and with the aid of a sharp stick he turns up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultivates them for six months , at the end of which time he gathers so much grain as will furnish him with a year 's supply of food . The food which he gets by spending a part of his time hunting with his new weapons becomes capital for his agricultural labor , enabling him to carry on a long industrial process , lasting six months , during all which time it yields him no return at all but at the end a much richer return than if he had spent the six months gathering shell- fish or berries . It must be remembered , too , that the quality as well as the quantity of the product must be taken account of in estimating the productiveness of labor . Now his hoard of grain will serve as capital for a whole year , so that he can carry on any industrial process he pleases of a year 's duration . Part of that time he may spend in making better agricultural tools , thus prolonging the process of raising a crop , and getting larger crops as the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as a person reaches that point where his // labor is more than sufficient to support him , where he need oniy give a part of his time to supplying his immediate wants , there is no theoretical limit to the length of the industrial processes to which he can devote the remainder of his time . It is not necessary that all the capital which is to support a laborer through an industrial process should be in existence when that process begins . In the first year of our castaway 's agricultural labor the capital needed to support him would come day by day from the hunting in which he spent a part of his time . The long agricultural process rests upon the products of a number of short processes , each of which latter comprises two sub-processes , namely , a part of a day 's hunting , which needs no capital , since it is carried on between meal and meal , combined with the two or three days ' labor spent in making the bow and arrows , for which the supply of food accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all industrial processes are very long and complicated . Consider what has been done to produce a barrel of flour in New York city . Several months were consumed in raising the wheat . This was done with plows and other implements made months or years before , out of iron previously mined , with the aid of tools previously made , which iron was mined and tools made with the help of machinery in like manner made with the products of previous processes . Then the wheat was ground in a mill and carried on a railroad which had taken no one can estimate how much previous labor . Besides this , the barrel had to be made . And until the flour was actually delivered to the consumer a portion of all those processes remained incomplete and in a most important sense fruitless , that is , had not resulted in anything available to directly satisfy human wants , to constitute real wages . It is impossible to form any adequate idea of the length and enormous complexity of the total industrial processes of making a barrel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we removed from the short and simple processes of the savage , who picks up his next meal when he has finished the last one . And our processes are as much more fruitful as they are complex , since they not only supply the laborer 's needs , and that more abund // antly than the savage is supplied , but support unproductive workers and furnish the materials for all our wealth and luxury . The difference is due to capital , which supports the laborer and enables , not the individual laborer , but the community to wait for the end of these long processes . But , it may be said , capital does more than merely support the laborer while the process is going on ; raw materials and tools are capital also . In one sense they are , and they are usu ally so called . As to any one of the subordinate and partial processes into which the total process is divided , those products of previous partial processes with which it starts , its tools and raw materials , are capital . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No products which are evolved in the course of a given industrial process are a part of the capital of that very process . If they could only live in the mean time , it is plain that a group of laborers , starting with no capital at all and receiving no outside help , could in time by their own labor merely produce anything that they desired , making their own tools and raw materials , mining the iron and cutting the timber , and acquiring the mechanical knowledge necessary . To be sure they would not do it so well or so quickly , since they would lose the advantages got from the division of labor , but they would do it in the end . But as it is they have to be supported while the work is going on , and this is the function of capital . If it be objected that they could support themselves by exchanging a portion of their intermediate products , the raw materials and tools which they would produce in the preparation for the final process , from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these intermediate products , raw materials and tools , are capital , the answer is , that that which can be exchanged for capital is not capital ; money is not bread , though it will buy bread . Tools and raw materials are wealth , and as such have value and can be exchanged for other kinds of wealth , but are not therefore capital . Or if we choose to call them a sort of capital , still when used in that way , that is , to exchange for sustenance wealth , they render to industry only the same service that the sustenance wealth renders , namely , of enabling the laborer to hold out through a // long industrial process instead of being driven by necessity to resort to shorter processes ; and so the important proposition is not shaken , that the only service capital renders to labor is to enable the community to wait longer for its final products . Tools and raw materials , inchoate wealth , are rather , what I have just called them , intermediate products . They may be compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it results in real wealth . Suppose that some kind of a magical machine should be invented by means of which all kinds of labor could be reduced to the one form of turning a crank , and the machine could be set to produce any kind of sustenance wealth desired , when the requisite number of turns of the crank had been made , so many turns for a barrel of flour , so many for a coat , and so forth . There would then be no occasion for producing any of these intermediate products ; all inchoate wealth , all tools , except the machines themselves , and all raw materials , would become useless . But capital would be needed as much as before . The laborer must still be supported while the desired articles are being ground out . If a barrel of flour cost five days of crank-turning , the laborer must be supported during that time . Such a machine , set to produce a given article and with a portion of the grinding already done , would have the same place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raw material for producing the article have at present-that is , as the raw material and so much of the tools as are consumed in the production of one such article ; for at present one tool makes many articles , and only a part of its value goes into each . A certain quantity of wheat and a grist mill are , so to speak , merely receptacles in which is stored up a part of the labor necessary to produce a barrel of flour . They have no use or value except so far as by further processes they can be made to yield up their contents into the flour . The labor already put into them may be compared to the solar heat of past ages latent in coal , which is given out for our warmth when the coal is subjected to the proper treatment . But the flour is useful per se , and not as a mere instrument for combining past with present labor to produce something else . Sustenance wealth , and therefore capital which is composed // of it , is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is not a mass of wealth which has been long accumulating . It is composed of a great number of articles which are being constantly destroyed and are constantly replaced . To use Professor Huxley 's fine comparison of a living creature , it is like a certain mound or ridge of water which one sees in the whirlpool at Niagara . At a little distance it looks like a fixed mass , unchanging and immovable ; but on examination , it is seen to be a mere momentary aggregation of particles of water which are swiftly whirled through it , any one particle remaining but a moment . The aggregate wealth of a country is simply an expression for the average aggregate out-put of its industries multiplied by the average time-not long-which intervenes between production and consumption . Thousands of industrial processes are all the time beginning and thousands are all the time coming to completion , and consumption goes on steadily . Moreover , consumption , on the whole , equals production . Even at times when the wealth of a country is rapidly increasing , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not grow rich because we keep more and consume less ; for the country , as a whole , in the long run and regularly , consumes all the wealth it produces and as fast as it produces it . There are no great hoards of wealth . Wealth hoarded is of no use ; and it must be either hoarded or consumed . The visible accumulated wealth of this country is mostly wealth that has not yet reached its completion , inchoate wealth , passing through the process of production . Besides this there is a certain amount of completed wealth waiting through the short interval between production and consumption . If production increases , this portion of wealth increases likewise ; but then consumption increases in a like ratio , so that the ratio of consumption as compared with production is as high when the nation is growing richer as when it is growing poorer . Growing rich simply means that the mass of products handled is becoming greater ; growing poorer , that it is decreasing . It is a question of the total volume of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other . Saving in the economical sense , by which capital is increased , is not // ceasing to consume our wealth as fast as it is produced , and thus letting it accumulate , but is consuming it productively , in supporting productive laborers , instead of unproductively . And the greater the amount of wealth thus " saved " the longer and more fruitful will the country 's industrial processes become , and the greater its wealth . What is commonly thought of as the " wealth " of a country , that which is permanent in the midst of this change , that which distinguishes a rich country like our own or England from a poor one like Mexico or Japan , that which can not be created in a hurry but is the result of long growth , is the organization and methods of its industries by which long processes are substituted for short ones . In a new country the soil is often richer , the gifts of nature more profuse , and the population no less industrious and intelligent than in an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the accumulated wealth , as it is called , will be far less . This leads to the impression that accumulated wealth means a large accumulated stock of material things which the new country has not had time to make . This is partly true so far as relates to buildings , railroads , docks and other permanent improvements on land . But as to movable things , which compose most of our visible wealth , how large a part of them in any country are ten years old ? Of course the longer , more complicated and more subdivided industrial processes are , the greater the number of intermediate products , the greater the proportion of labor that must be temporarily embodied in tools and materials showing as visible wealth . But those things are merely incidental . In a thinly settled new country , the amount of wealth produced by one person 's labor may be as great as or greater than in an old country . Probably one man in Australia produces ' more on the average by his year 's work than one in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people being equally intelligent , at once adopt the long processes of the old ? Usually from want of numbers . To change from shorter processes to longer ones takes time , during which the laborers who have been drawn off from the old processes to the new are producing no sustenance wealth and yet are consuming as much as before . That implies that the community produces a surplus of wealth , beyond what // is needed for the support of the population , available for this purpose . But however high individual wages are , the amount that any one person can spare to go into such a surplus is small , and therefore it is only when the community is very numerous that , by taking a little from each , such a surplus can be got . In old and thickly settled countries the operation of the laws of rent tends to reduce wages and collect wealth in masses in a few hands , the result of which is , a result that partly counterbalances the evil , that a larger proportion is made available as capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fruits of their labor to the land-owner , the latter use more of what they receive as capital than the laborers would if it remained in their hands . In populous but backward countries , on the other hand , like the great Oriental nations , the cause of not using long processes is sometimes that individual earnings are so very small that even from a great number of people a considerable surplus can not be raised , or else that want of trustworthiness or knowledge or the lack of a government good enough to adequately protect the more complicated and delicate industrial arrangements that long processes involve stands in the way . During a residence of several years in Japan I tried to make a comparative estimate of the average amount of wealth produced by the labor of one person in Japan and in this country . As nearly as I could find out , it was about as 1 to 8 or 10 . Now if a Japanese laborer produces only one-eighth as much as an American laborer , it is plain that , even if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting himself , the surplus available for all other purposes will be very much less than with us . Only gradually and in a long time , can better processes take the place of worse ones , and the stream of wealth , so to speak , that is always pouring through a community ,  --  running out , like all streams , as fast as it runs in ,  --  be increased in volume , or , to use the common expression , can a greater accumulation of wealth take place . The loans , so called , of capital , that old countries make to new ones , though reckoned in money , usually come in shape of manufactured goods , largely inchoate wealth , the products of subordinate and incomplete industrial processes . In other // words , industrial processes are begun in the old country and finished in the new . The new country , not being as yet able to carry through the whole of long processes , has to take them up midway , and thus by what are to it short processes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are grafted upon and to a certain extent made a part of the industrial system of the old country . It is labor , population , which the new country needs , and if we recur to our former comparison of inchoate wealth , as being like receptacles in which past labor is stored up , we shall see that what is called a loan of capital is really equivalent to a loan of labor , together , since inchoate wealth is not a consumer , with so much capital as is necessary to support that labor . The amount of capital in a country depends upon the total amount of its wealth and upon what proportion of that wealth is used as capital . The former is a question partly of the average productiveness of its labor , which varies with the extent of its natural resources , the character of its laborers , the effectiveness with which its government protects contracts and property , the length of its industrial processes , and sundry other less important factors , and partly of the number of persons engaged in productive labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be capital , and , as has been said , the longer the processes of production are the larger the proportion of wealth which must remain in an inchoate form . But although with long processes the proportion of sustenance wealth capable of being used as capital is smaller than with short ones , its actual amount is greater , because the total is so much greater . All sustenance wealth is in its nature fit to be used as capital , but not all is so used . So much as is expended in supplying the wants of persons who do not work at all , or of unproductive laborers is not capital , but only that which is held to be used to support producers. * Money is not capital but only the representative or symbol of capital , standing in much the same relation to capital that checks on banks do to money itself . How much sustenance wealth shall be devoted to such uses * Perhaps not strictly the whole of that . A question might be raised as to the status of sustenance wealth which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet been consumed by them . // depends entirely upon the mere will and pleasure of its owners , the capitalists. * A man owning a certain amount of sustenance wealth , or having a power , in the shape of bank credit or money , of calling at any time for a portion of the community 's general stock of such wealth , may spend it in supporting himself and his family in idleness or in paying laborers to perform unproductive services for him , or he may use it to employ productive laborers . He may yield to any whim of the moment . But it does not follow from this that the amount of capital is not subject to and fixed by laws , as some have asserted . It is often ignorantly asked , since each person is free to turn as much or as little of his wealth into capital as he chooses , and there is no law that compels him to use any particular amount of it thus , how can there be any law for the community as a whole , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its plausibility from an ambiguity in the word law . By law we sometimes mean a command , addressed to any intelligent being , creating upon him a duty to do some act , which command he has the power to obey or disobey . The law in no way affects the possibility of his acting but merely his duty to act . This is law in the jural sense . Law in the scientific sense , how . ever , has nothing in common with jural law except the common connotation of order or regularity in the happening of events . We observe that as a matter of fact certain kinds of events always occur in certain regular connections , and the statements in which we describe those regularities we call laws . Such laws are not commamids , they are not addressed as such to any one , they do not necessarily or usually concern the actions of intelligent being , they create no duties , they can not be broken or disobeyed . The word " ought " has no meaning in connection with them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , it is a scientific law that the chemical elements , when they combine with each other , do so in certain definite * For convenience 's sake in economical discussions , laborers and capitalists are usually spoken of as different persons . But there is no reason at afl why they must be and often they are not . Most capitalists in this country work , and a very large number of wage-laborers are to a greater or less extent capitalists , having deposits in savings banks , or being policy holders in insurance companies , whose funds are invested proiluctively , or even owning interests in their employers ' businesses . // proportions . This does not mean that they are commanded by any one to combine so , or that they ought to , or that any one knows of any reason why they should , but simply that in fact they always do . And when we can not find out the exact law so as to be quite sure what the connections between phenomena are going to be , yet we may often detect a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a law , and be able to state some approximation to it in the form of a law of averages or tendencies , a general law , as we say , subject to exceptions from unknown causes , which though incomplete , shall still be of great practical value . Thus not every red haired person is irascible , nor do we know the exact laws of this connection , and not every week in Spring is hotter than the preceding week , yet it is a general rule that red hair and an irascible temperament go together and that the weather gets warmer as Spring advances . Now the laws of political economy are scientific and not jural ones , and very many of them are of the nature of laws of average or tendency , expressing pretty accurately how things will turn out in the long run or how they tend to turn out , but not to be relied upon to give accurately the results in any given case . In this general way it is found that even those actions of men which seem to depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to be quite incapable of being foreseen or brought under any law in any particular case , are yet tolerably regular and calculable when we deal with large numbers of persons . The time of any man 's death is proverbially uncertain , and yet the whole business of life insurance is based upon calculations of the average death rate in the community , so accurate that when carried on upon a large enough scale life insurance is one of the least risky of businesses . What is more entirely a matter of one 's free choice than committing suicide or getting married ? Yet the police of Paris can make a very close guess how many people will kill themselves in that city within the next year , how many in each month  --  the different mouths not being alike in this-by what means and how many by each method ; and in England it has long been an observed fact that the number of marriages is connected with the price of wheat . // It is just so in regard to capital . Although the amount that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends ntterly upon his own will , his whim or freak if you choose , yet in the mass , on the average , one person 's whims will balance another 's ; if A is more la*vish than most men , B will be more frugal . The ratio of capital to wealth keeps pretty steady or changes slowly , following the variations of other social phenomena , according to laws which can be partly traced now and doubtless will at some future time be much more fully known . I do not care to stop here to explain what the causes are which determine how much of the community 's whole sustenance wealth shall be used as capital or what are the laws of its increase and decrease . The point I wish to make is that , however freely or willfully each possessor of wealth may seem to act , it is determined by causes , there are laws . So far as capital is used in an industrial process it constitutes to the workmen an advance of wages . Wages being the reward or end for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if before the labor produces such wealth it is supplied to the laborer from some other source , that is advanced wages . When a complete industrial process is divided np into sub-processes , each of those sub-processes resulting in the production of some form of inchoate wealth , materials or tools , which are then handed over to the set of laborers who are to carry on the next sub-process , the common and almost necessary arrangement is for the second set of capitalists to buy the tools and materials outright , that is , to advance the whole of the wages of the former set of laborers . Therefore , although theoretically it is not necessary that the whole of the laborers ' wages should be advanced from capital , but only so much as is absolutely essential to their support , it being theoretically quite possible for them to wait for the remainder till the whole process is completed and then come in for a share of the final product of sustenance wealth , yet practically full wages must be advanced in all the sub-processes but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical to do so in that too . For all practical purposes , then , we may say that in a country with a highly developed industrial system the whole of wages are paid in advance out of capital . Many of the // apparent exceptions to this statement are merely apparent . If , as is sometimes the case , laborers receive no wages from their employer till the whole job is done and the product sold , and then get , not fixed wages , but a fixed proportion of the gross or net proceeds , still this is a case of advanced wages if the product divided be not a completed product in the form of sustenance wealth ; or even if it is , if the time occupied by the job has been longer than since the last occasion when sustenance was taken . The only difference is , that in the case supposed it is not the immediate employer who advances the capital . But that is of no consequence at all in relation to a general theory of wages . The point is that wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . Whether the particular portion advanced to a particular laborer belonged to this capitalist or that , though doubtless important to the parties immediately concerned , has no interest for us here . Wages being advanced out of capital , and capital being that part of the wealth of the country which it sets apart for investment for supporting productive labor , and which the capitalists are always seeking to invest , it is plain , that , if we add to capital the amount of wealth devoted by its owners to paying the wages of unproductive laborers , which is fixed by " laws " and remains like capital tolerably steady in amount , we shall have what economists call the " wages fund " of the country , and that the average rate of wages for labor will be the quotient got by dividing this wages fund by the number of laborers , both productive and unprbductive . This theory of wages has been violently combated on several grounds . Many of the objections to it , like a very large part of the objections raised against other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by persons who have not studied political economy carefully and by some who have , rest upon purely sentimental or emotional grounds , and therefore can not be reached by argument . They have their origin in dislike to the practical deductions to be drawn from those doctrines . For example , this very doctrine of a wages fund affords powerful arguments against the expediency of strikes , and is therefore generally obnoxious to workingmen . It is the misfortune of the science of political economy that it // is within its domain that the severe and relentless natural laws of the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest , which many tender and noble minds find it hard to admit even in reference to the brutes , show themselves most conspicuously in their application to the human race . Many of the fundamental principles of that science , such as the laws of population and rent which are called by the names of ZMialthns and iRicardo - though as now accepted somewhat changed from the form in which those great thinkers first announced them-are merely special applications of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This awful ' struggle is , to me at least , the most terrible of all the mysteries with which we are surrounded in this world ; and the fact that political economy deals so largely with this and also generally with the more sordid rather than the nobler side of human nature gives it a forbidding aspect and creates a , tendency to rebel against its severe doctrines on emotional grounds , a tendency which , however natural , is unfortunate for the science and for the community . Most of the objections to the wages fund theory which are not sentimental , rest upon a denial of the proposition that wages are paid in advance out of capital , as is the case , for example , with Profs . Francis A. Walker and Henry George . Of this enough has been said . Others still arise from a mistaken idea that by a wages fund is meant a fund accumulated and set apart to pay wages before the process of production has begun , or even a permanent fund . Thus Prof. Walker speaks of the sup'posed wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he denies , would be in the position of having been " wasted by dynastic wars . " If all the industrial processes of a community began and ended at the same time , then the whole wages fund for any process would have to be provided and in hand at the time of the commencement of that process . For example , if we could imagine a community producing absolutely nothing but wheat and consuming nothing else , raising only one crop a year , then a part of each year 's crop would be the wages fund for raising the next crop , and would be all accumulated before the work began . Such a wages fund would be like a reservoir // once filled then drawn from till empty , and then filled up full again , and so on . But in fact , as was said some time back , industrial processes are every day beginning and ending , and pouring their products into the general stock of wealth , from which wages are daily drawn . The wages fund may rather be compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brook , fed by a thousand rills , flowing in on one side , are caught and held for a brief space till they flow out again at the other side . No matter how little water the stream may have poured in a few years ago , when the combatants in a " dynastic war " dammed it up above and turned its waters in some other direction , if it be flowing full now , the basin will be full again , and the stream below will always receive as much as keeps coming in from the stream above . Just as the accumulated wealth of a country is , in one sense , only a representative of the average regular output of its industries , so is the wages fund a name for a certain tolerably fixed proportion or percentage of that output . The above considerations also dispose of another criticism on the wages fund theory , the last that I wish to consider . The three essentials of production are land , labor , and capital ; and the net product , deducting taxes and insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish these , that is , the landlords , laborers , and capitalists , as reutj wages , and profits . Wages are , or represent , the laborers ' share of that product . The law of wages then , it would seem , should take the form of a law of the distribution of the final product rather than of the supply of and demand for labor as the wage fund theory puts it . And the rate of wages would seem to depend rather upon the amount of the final product than upon anything which must be past and gone before that product appears or its amount can be known . And in many economic discussions it is necessary to treat wages as a question of distribution rather than of supply and demand . * What was said in a former note of wages applies also to rent ; it does not in the economical sense imply any letting or hiring of the land . A farmer who owns his own farm and tills it with his own hands receives rent and wages in the economical sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence the absurdity of the statement , so often heard , Ricardo 's law of rent has little application in this country because most of our farmers ( fortunately ) own thefr farms instead of hiring them . // The difficulty is similar to the one that arises in the case of value in connection with supply and demand and cost of production . On the one hand it is said that the value of a commodity depends upon the supply of it , as balanced against the demand for it , and on the other hand that its value depends upon its cost of production . And both statements are true. * How then can they be shown to be not in conflict ? Why may not value rise under au increased demand while at the same time it ought to fall because of a lessened cost of production ? Certainly increased demand and lessened cost of production often go together . A reconcilement is effected by pointing out the difference between market or temporary or local value , which does depend upon supply and demand , and normal value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production , and by the proposition that supply always tends to adjust itself to demand at the normal value . While therefore temporary change in supply and demand may cause the market or actual selling price of a commodity to depart , often considerable , in either direction from its normal value , yet there is always a strong influence forcing it back in the tendency of producers to turn out just so much and no more of any particular kind of goods as they can sell at the normal price , so that the average of market prices , for long periods , will not be far from that value . In other words , supply and demand are the immediate and direct controllers of value , and cost of production acts upon it indirectly by controlling supply . Something analogous is true of wages . The immediate elements are the present wages fund , as the dividend aud the number of laborers as the divisor . But the wages fund itself is mere expression for a certain proportion of the average product of labor , and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laborers is increased , so that they produce more , they will get larger wages , and if it is diminished they will get smaller-not in the very process in which * True enough for our present purpose . In fact , as Professor Cairnes shows in his admirable Principles of Political Economy , there is another element , " the reciprocal demand " as he calls it , of different groups of workers , which enters along with cost of production into normal . values . // the increase or diminution first occurs ; in that process the gain or loss caused by the change will accrue to the capitalist ; but in the next , when the increased or diminished product has had time to be added to the general fund of the community and its influence felt . Thus the law of the wages fund is exhibited as at bottom a law of distribution . The really important point for the laborer therefore is that the industries ofthe country in general shall be as productive as possible . It is on that that his welfare in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that , that possessors of wealth shall be induced to invest as large a proportion as possible as capital in the support of productive industry , which mainly depends upon the certainty that they will get fair profits from it . Anything that frightens timid capital and makes its owners afraid to invest it is a direct blow at the laborers . I have spoken only of the average rate of wages . The laws of the causes that produce inequality in wages between different classes of workers , that make a scrub woman get $200 a year and the president of a great corporation $50,000 , have no close connection with the theory of capital , and therefore need not be discussed here . They depend mainly upon the " reciprocal demand " of the classes , mentioned in a note previously , and are substantially identical with the laws of normal value .
