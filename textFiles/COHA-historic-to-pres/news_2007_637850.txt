With the start of the college football season only six weeks away , optimism abounds at Oklahoma State . The Cowboys open the season Sept. 1 with a marquee road game at Georgia and are a trendy pick to win the Big 12 South . <p> And the sophomore linebacker Chris Collins , perhaps the Cowboys ' best defensive player , is expected to help , even though he has been under indictment for almost three years . <p> In May 2004 , Collins and another man were arrested and charged with sexually assaulting an intoxicated 12-year-old girl at a hotel in Texarkana , Tex. , during an after-prom party . Two other men were charged in December 2005 . Collins pleaded not guilty in March , after being indicted by a grand jury in December 2004 . <p> Bowie County District Attorney Bobby Lockhart said Friday that he planned to ask that Collins 's trial begin Aug. 20 , the first day of classes at Oklahoma State . But on Aug. 2 , Collins is scheduled to be on the football field as practice begins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Oklahoma State 's top returning defensive player . As a freshman starter last season , he was the team 's second-leading tackler , with 31 , before sustaining a season-ending knee injury in its sixth game . He had three and a half tackles for losses , a sack , a fumble recovery and a blocked kick . <p> Collins has recovered and has been participating in team activities . <p> Through a university spokesman , Oklahoma State Coach Mike Gundy declined to comment on Collins until the charge had been resolved . <p> The case has created controversy in Texarkana , a small city of 35,000 on the Arkansas border . Collins and the three other men are black and the girl is white ; some black residents have questioned whether the case has racial overtones . <p> Collins , then 17 , was charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child , a felony that carries a possible sentence of 5 years to 99 years or life in prison . He has been free on $40,000 bond . <p> Lockhart said that Collins confessed to the police that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl said she did not consent . <p> " We 're pretty deep , " Lockhart said Wednesday of his commitment to the case in an interview at his Texarkana office . " We 're serious . " <p> Collins did not play his senior year at Texas High School because of the charge against him . He was given a scholarship at Oklahoma State after Texas rescinded its offer . <p> At last year 's Big 12 football media days in Kansas City , Mo. , Gundy said that he had thoroughly researched Collins 's background before signing him . He also praised Collins for his work ethic and ability to mesh with the team . <p> A Texas Public Information Act request by The New York Times yielded some documents about Collins 's case . Other documents with greater detail about the incident were released mistakenly to The Texarkana Gazette , a Texarkana police department spokesman said , and were not made available to The Times . <p> According to The Texarkana Gazette , court records say that Collins and another man , Charles Johnson , drove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party after the Texas High prom about 2 a.m. on May 23 , 2004 . At the hotel , the 12-year-old girl became drunk after being given vodka mixed with orange juice . Aaron Johnson , the brother of Charles Johnson , provided the hotel room and the alcohol . <p> The girls were later dropped off at 6:30 a.m. , a block from the girl 's home . She had bruises on her neck and scratches on her arms and shoulder . A family member took her to a local emergency room . <p> The Texarkana Gazette reported that the police department received the results of DNA testing from the state crime lab in November 2005 . And according to the court documents , as reported in The Gazette , the samples collected from the girl matched those of Collins , Jabari Jackson and the Johnson brothers . <p> The Johnson brothers and Jackson are also charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child . They each pleaded not guilty in March . Charles Johnson , 21 , did not return a message left for him . Jackson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved with her family to northern Arkansas and will be a key part of the prosecution 's case , Lockhart said . <p> Paul Hoover , Collins 's lawyer , declined to grant a request to interview Collins . But in October 2004 , Collins said he was innocent in an interview with InsideTexas.com , a Web site that covers Longhorns athletics and recruiting . <p> " I 'm not guilty , that 's all I can say , " Collins said at the time . " I did n't do nothing . I was just lied to and that 's pretty much what happened . I just need to be more careful . She accused me of rape , but I know I did n't do that for sure . " <p> Even if she had consented to sex , Lockhart said , she could not have legally done so under Texas law until she was 14 or older . <p> Hoover declined to discuss the specifics of Collins 's case but described him as a good kid who does not get into trouble . " His future is laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably a big-time N.F.L prospect . " <p> Benjamin Dennis , president of the N.A.A.C.P. in Texarkana  --  whose population is roughly 60 percent white and 37 percent black  --  said that some of the city 's black residents were concerned about the handling of the case , particularly the delay in trying the four men . <p> " If they were guilty , then the evidence should have been presented in a timely fashion , " he said . " They should have been tried , and if convicted , sentenced . Justice should have been administered at least . " <p> Lockhart , though , said that Collins 's case was one of his most pressing priorities . <p> " On a scale of 1 to 10 , he 's an 8 1/2 or a 9 , " he said . <p> Lockhart acknowledged that Collins 's case had taken longer than usual to go to trial . It was delayed because of the prosecution 's concern for the girl 's well-being and while DNA testing was conducted , he said . <p> " We 're past where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is not a delay to let Collins get better playing football at Oklahoma State . " <p> Lockhart dismissed the notion that Collins 's case was being pursued because of race . <p> " I 'm very aware of where I live , " he said . " I live in the South and northeast Texas . Will some people make that allegation against me ? Absolutely . That 's fine . That 's not the motivation behind this . " <p> Texas High Coach Barry Norton said he remained shocked by the charge against his former player . He said Collins had a quiet demeanor and was never previously in trouble . He had a grade point average of 3.3 in high school , Norton said . <p> " It 's just a sad thing for everybody , " Norton said Wednesday . " It breaks my heart for him . For everybody involved in it , there 's been a lot of pain . You just hate to see young people 's lives affected in situations like this . " <p> On the football field , Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose team played against the Cowboys last season , said Collins was a dynamic playmaker with explosive speed . <p> " He 's an off-the-screen guy , " Briles said in a telephone interview . " When you watch him , he jumps off the television screen . " <p> Despite that talent , Lockhart said that it would have no bearing on the way he prosecuted his case . <p> " In today 's society , there 's always been this point of view that high-profile athletes get away with lots of things , " Lockhart said . " It 's not my intention or our intention here at the D.A . ' s office to prove they 're not going to here . It 's my intention to say , ' Let 12 people make the call .
