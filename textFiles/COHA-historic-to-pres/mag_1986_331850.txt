In August , the Labor Department 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration began to investigate Union Carbide , after a leak of the toxic chemical Aldicarb at the company 's Institute , W. Va. , plant left 141 people hospitalized . Last week OSHA levied a $1.4 million fine against the Danbury , Conn. - based firm for " willful disregard for health and safety " at the Institute plant . It was the largest penalty imposed by OSHA in its 16-year history . <P> OSHA 's probe resulted in 221 charges of safety violations against the company . Carbide President Robert Kennedy , who said the fine would be appealed , contended that most of OSHA 's accusations were " entirely unjustified " and that no infractions were " willful.
