Europe 's most explosive crisis last week was in Belgium . The man who might detonate it . King Leopold III , was in St. Wolfgang in the Austrian Alps . Reports that he might come home sent angry citizens swirling through the streets , shouting : " Down with Leopold ! ' ' " Hang the King ! " Defiant Walloons ( French-speaking Belgians ) threatened to bar his reentry into the country with their bodies . Socialist Premier Achille van Acker threatened to resign if King Leopold set foot on Belgian soil . There were rumors that Britain might intervene to restore Leopold to his throne . <P> Loud Resentment . Except for the Catholics , all Belgian parties of the left and center had joined to resist the royal return . Behind this loud resistance was Belgian loud resentment because Leopold had : 1 ) surrendered to Germany in 1940 instead of continuing the war in exile ; 2 ) married a commoner , comely Mademoiselle Marie-Lelia Baels , while most of his subjects were suffering under the German occupation ; 3 ) thereby become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charge of collaboration with the enemy . There was no expressed opposition to the King 's eldest son , Prince Baudouin , 14 , whom Leopold 's younger brother , Prince Regent Charles , was training for the pleasures of kingship . <P> But King Leopold 's dilemma was acute . As a constitutional monarch , he could not flout the advice of Belgium 's Premier , unless he could replace him with a less hostile Premier . But any Premier and Cabinet that favored the King 's return could be fairly sure of a resounding no-confidence vote in Belgium 's Parliament . To St. Wolfgang the King urgently summoned several leading Belgians for talks . Reports that Leopold would appoint prewar Premier Paul van Zeeland or Lieut . General Ganshof van der Meersh , a Resistance leader , as Premier were met by Brussels trade unions with threats of a general strike . Gloomed Van Zeeland : " I wish the next few weeks were already past . " <P> " Be a King . " King Leopold 's plight drew Europe 's dynasts together . Off to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's relative , dashed Belgium 's Dowager Queen Elizabeth , Leopold 's mother . <P> From strong-willed Queen Mary , the Belgian Queen received right royal counsel : Leopold must " be a King . " Luxembourg 's Grand Duchess Charlotte asked King Leopold to pay her a visit . Luxembourg is Belgium 's southeastern neighbor . From St. Wolfgang , King Leopold promptly announced that there was " no question of abdicating , " that he was proceeding with the formation of a new government .
