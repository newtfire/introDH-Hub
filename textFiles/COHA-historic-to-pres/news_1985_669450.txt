Texas : a highly urbanized state where education and research are top priorities . . . where health care for the poor and other features of the welfare state are gaining new financial support . . . where vestiges of Christian conservatism , such as laws against Sunday shopping , are dying off . . . where high-tech aims to someday rival oil in the state ' s economy . . . where computers could someday replace oil derricks as symbols of the state ' s economy. // Which is the real Texas ? Judging by the recently concluded session of the state ' s 181 legislators , the Longhorn State is both. // According to Democratic Lt. Gov . William Hobby , legislative action taken over the past year means nothing less than a ' ' revolution ' ' for Texas. // ' ' These are sweeping changes that will bring in a new era , ' ' says Mr. Hobby . He points to approval of the state ' s first health-care plan for indigents ; unemployment compensation for farm workers ; health insurance for retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-tech research fund for the state ' s premier universities . He adds to this a sweeping , multibillion-dollar education-reform bill , approved last summer in a special session . The package included the state ' s first general tax increase in 17 years. // // ' ' Taken all together , these constitute a revolution ' ' that will mean above all ' ' a substantial improvement in the quality of life of the poorest in our state , ' ' Hobby says. // The Legislature ' s actions suggest a major shift for Texas . But , its members say , the changes reflect the state ' s rapid urbanization rather than any ideological metamorphosis. // Recognition of Texas ' status as a major population center with diverse interests and complex problems - including , for the first time , budgetary ones - has led , they say , to a new consensus between the populous east and the wide-open west , between conservatives and those of more liberal stripes. // Evidence of the consensus comes from support among west Texans for legislation that appears to benefit urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face value , appear to be liberal causes . Senate parliamentarian Camilla Brodie says that , far from suggesting a move in Texas to the left , approval this year of a number of social programs indicates ' ' a new enlightened self-interest. ' ' // But there was also action in the biennial session , which ended May 31 , that suggests a desire to hold on to a certain way of life in Texas - one that is particularly free of government interference . Examples include continued refusal to consider either a personal or corporate income tax ( the House even toyed with making such taxes unconstitutional ) and failure to outlaw drinking while driving . The legislators ' refusal to tighten up gaping loopholes in the state ' s open meeting laws is seen by some as a desire to hold on to closed-door governance by key power brokers , which they say figured into much of this year ' s most important legislation. // But several of those who believe major changes have occurred also suggest that the ' ' revolution ' ' and new-found consensus could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ' ' The state has changed a great deal , ' ' says Max Sherman , dean of the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas here . ' ' Much of it is due to the large and growing urban presence. ' ' // Mr. Sherman , a former state senator from west Texas , notes that more than half of the state ' s 16 million people live in the six largest cities : Houston , Dallas , Fort Worth , San Antonio , El Paso , and Austin . A recent United States Census Bureau report shows that 4 of the nation ' s 11 fastest-growing metropolitan areas are in Texas. // ' ' The consensus may well be a realization that we can no longer close our eyes to the needs of half the population of the state , ' ' Sherman says. // John Leedom , a conservative and one of only six Republicans in the 31-seat state Senate , was a strong supporter of the health-care plan for indigents , despite opposition from state GOP leaders and last-minute lobbying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Leedom says his support derives from a belief that ' ' we should have indigent care , and it ' s right that the state should pay for some of it . ' ' But he adds that a more pragmatic reason for his support was a desire to create a system that ' ' spreads the burden of paying for such care to a much broader base . ' ' Under the old system , counties were responsible for providing such care . ' ' But many of them didn ' t , ' ' he says , ' ' so in our area , for example , you had the poor coming to hospitals in Dallas . The urban areas ended up paying a disproportionate part of the cost. ' ' // Leedom says he agrees that urbanization is ' ' a common thread that runs through many of these issues . ' ' But he adds that another ' ' backdrop ' ' to the legislative action is that ' ' for the first time , Texas is wrestling with a lack of unlimited funds. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the state ' s coffers . The state loses more than $40 million for every dollar drop in the price of a barrel of oil , not to mention the effects of reduced drilling and the closure of oil-supply businesses . Legislators began the five-month session in January with projections of a $1. 2 billion deficit , but ended up balancing the two-year , $37. 2 billion budget - they hope - through some cuts , and by raising various fees and college tuition. // The state ' s new budget troubles may have helped bring about other changes as well . According to Senator Leedom , repeal of ' ' blue laws ' ' prohibiting Sunday shopping was probably helped by claims that the extra day would boost sales-tax revenues by $24 million a year. // George Strake , state Republican chairman , says he believes the recently approved programs will mean state corporate and individual income taxes will have to be considered by the next Legislature , which meets in 1987. // ' ' I tend to agree with the lieutenant governor that a revolution has taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m not at all sure that it ' s a good one . ' ' Seeing elements of the welfare state in the new programs , Strake says : ' ' I ' m not sure I like the Texas they ' re trying to build. ' ' // The vehement opposition to any income tax may seem extreme to those long-since accustomed to such taxes , especially since per capita , Texans pay less in taxes than almost anyone else in the country . But Sherman says he believes many Texans in ' ' all economic categories ' ' take pride in the fact that Texas has no income tax . It ' s a reflection of a high regard for individualism , he says - and a historic distrust of government. // Another vestige of disdain for government , he says , is the state ' s biennial legislative session , drafted in response to the carpetbagger governments that ran the state after the Civil War. // The right to drink while driving is also often seen as an individual decision that government should not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says that even among some nondrinkers , ' ' it ' s taken to be a God-given right to drive around with a beer if a fellow wants to. ' ' // For his part , Lieutenant Governor Hobby says many Texans still picture President Johnson driving his ' ' big ol ' Caddy ' ' around his ranch at 100 miles an hour , throwing empty beer cans out the window . ' ' It ' s part of their image of Texas , ' ' he says. // Sherman says that despite such folklore , it ' s more likely that a strong liquor lobby , rather than individualistic Texans , is the primary reason for repeated defeat of open-container laws . Gov . Mark White did sign legislation raising the drinking age from 19 to 21. // Be that as it may , there is still evidence that Texans , no matter how urbanized , are a little different from longtime urban dwellers to the north. // After the Legislature voted in May to repeal the blue laws effective September , Chicago retailer Marshall Field &; Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundays . But it reversed that decision , apparently under pressure from locally owned stores . Despite some openings in other cities , retailers in conservative Dallas seem in no rush to open on Sundays. // // //
