Most of the time , a New York City municipal election has all the suspense and flavor of lunch at the automat-deposit the votes and out pops another machine-tooled Democrat . But two-term Mayor Robert Ferdinand Wagner has jammed the mechanism by breaking openly with the Democratic bosses ( TIME , June 30 ) and choosing his own running mates for a third-term attempt in November . Ever since , the city 's political future has been as confusing as a subway map . <P> Hardly had Wagner picked his ticket when the bosses he had defied selected their own slate , dared him to enter a bloody September primary . The Tammany organization 's choice for mayor : State Controller Arthur Levitt , 61 , a respected vote getter ever since he survived Nelson Rockefeller 's 1958 Republican blitz into Albany . Levitt is a product of New York schools , from P.S. 19 to Columbia University ; he served on the board of education before running for controller , and has won bipartisan praise for cautiously watchdogging state funds . <P> Sinister Evil . Wagner wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of callous political bosses headed by Carmine De Sapio , " warned of " sinister evil " if Levitt were elected . What the mayor forgot was that he himself had also been a De Sapio selection ( TIME cover , Oct. 1 , 1956 ) and that there has been a lot of evil in the city under Bumbling Bob . Wagner 's administration , among its many scandals , has been graced by a city purchasing agent who milked the city of $500,000 through rigged bidding on rock salt . Currently the city is flinching under charges of poor construction and payoffs in its school system . And last week the investigation reached to the school system 's top . Superintendent John J. Theobald admitted he had a 15-ft. runabout built for him at cost by shop students , was vague about how , or to whom , he had paid the necessary $400 for the boat 's materials . <P> <P> Ragtag Army . Dumped by the regular Democratic organization , Wagner is desperately shopping for influential backers . But so far he has produced only former Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . James A. Farley , far removed from the inner circles of New York politics , and blustering Mike Quill , president of the Transport Workers Union . With such a ragtag army , Wagner is almost sure to lose to Levitt if he insists on entering the Democratic primary . But the mayor is also the Liberal Party candidate , and can run on the Liberal ticket in the general election . At that time voters will have to make their choice from a list including not only Wagner and Levitt , but also Republican Candidate Louis J. Lefkowitz and City Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa . Gerosa has broken with both the mayor and the Tammany bosses , will run as an independent beholden only to " God and the good people . " Said one reform Democrat in Manhattan last week : " We 're stuck with four hacks . Gerosa is a sham . Lefkowitz is a mediocrity . Levitt is Carmine 's boy . And Wagner is Wagner .
