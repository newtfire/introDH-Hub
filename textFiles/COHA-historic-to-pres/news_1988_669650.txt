Administration officials acknowledge that the chances of doing so are not high . Mr. Shamir is expected to express his strong reservations to the US peace plan when he meets with President Reagan , Secretary of State George Shultz , and other government leaders this week . He will also present his own plan. // But Mr. Shultz clearly hopes that , through a carefully shaped strategy of quiet persuasion , the United States will at a minimum sharpen the debate within Israel over the choices it faces over the peace issue . At the maximum , it may lay a foundation for beginning a peace process. // // ' ' It ' s a long shot , ' ' a State Department official says . ' ' But we ' re still hoping the proposal can be the basis for starting negotiations. ' ' // Prime Minister Shamir will have a heavy round of meetings this week with administration officials , members of Congress , academic experts , and American Jewish leaders . His visit comes at a time when the mood in Congress and among many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But the obstacles to launching a peace process are formidable. // One crucial question bound to be raised by Shamir is whether the US is prepared to make any concession on the concept of an international conference . The Israeli prime minister has reluctantly accepted such a conference if it merely launches the peace talks . But he does not want the conference to be an ongoing process. // Another obstacle is the ' ' land for peace ' ' formula , an issue wrapped in ambiguities and controversy. // Shamir and his Likud bloc do not accept the US interpretation of UN Resolutions 242 and 338 , which call for Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories in return for secure borders . In a recent letter to members of Congress , Shamir said that he accepts 242 as a basis for negotiations , but he reaffirmed Likud ' s position that Israel must not give up any territory in the West Bank ( ' ' Judea and Samaria ' ' ) . The return of Sinai to Egypt , he said , had fulfilled the conditions of 242. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , or the Israeli Labor bloc , which constitutes half the Israeli coalition . From the outset , 242 has been interpreted to mean that Israel must withdraw from occupied territory on all fronts , i. e. , the Egyptian , Jordanian , and Syrian . Israel , in fact , formally accepted that position in 1970 , although it would not say how far it had to withdraw. // The Camp David accords of 1978 are vague on the issue . The Carter administration wanted then Prime Minister Menachem Begin to agree that the ' ' results ' ' of future negotiations over the West Bank would be based on the principles of 242 . But the hard-line leader would agree only to basing the ' ' negotiations ' ' on 242 . In other words , Jordan could raise the issue of an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in negotiations , but Israel was not obligated to accept the principle of withdrawal. // ' ' The Likud people have not swerved on 242 , ' ' says William Quandt , a former Carter aide who was intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it both ways - it accepts 242 but it reinterprets it. ' ' // The Palestine Liberation Organization , for its part , does not accept 242 , because the resolution does not mention the Palestinian question but refers only to ' ' refugees. ' ' // Secretary Shultz is trying to steer a cautious course through this shoal of controversy . From the time he began his recent shuttle diplomacy , he has talked publicly of ' ' territory for peace . ' ' But his letter to Prime Minister Shamir last week outlining his peace proposal conspicuously makes no mention of land for peace . Instead , it suggests that negotiations could begin in May and be based on Resolutions 242 and 338 ' ' in all their parts , ' ' a formulation that leaves the interpretation open. // ' ' Our position is consistent - withdrawal means withdrawal on all fronts , including West Bank and Gaza , ' ' a US official says. // The Reagan administration seems to be pursuing a policy of firm public urgings on the one hand and friendly behind-the-scenes persuasion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter from 30 senators criticizing Shamir ' s refusal to negotiate on the basis of a ' ' land for peace ' ' formula - a rather extraordinary development given the touchiness of lawmakers on questions affecting Israel . Yet it quietly staved off a similar initiative in the House. // At the same time , Shultz told a congressional hearing last week that Israel must rethink its concept of defense and focus on the ' ' ticking demographic time bomb . ' ' Modern missiles , he said , have changed security calculations , intimating that hanging on to the West Bank and Gaza is no guarantee of security. // For domestic political reasons , lawmakers are reluctant to do or say anything that might invite criticism from Israel or the American Jewish community . But given the persisting violence in the occupied territories , they are supportive of Shultz ' s effort. // ' ' The need for something besides the status quo is obvious , ' ' says Rep. Dante B. Fascell , Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . ' ' Thirty more years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and it ' s vital for the US to be doing what it ' s doing. ' ' // Most Mideast experts say they think the Shultz initiative comes too late in the Reagan administration to succeed . The coming Israeli elections , a leadership vacuum within the PLO , the erosion of US credibility in the Arab world , and the complexity of the issues are said to weigh against a diplomatic breakthrough . Shamir ' s hope , experts say , is that Palestinian unrest can be brought under control and that any negotiating process will be minimal. // ' ' It is important to make an effort , and Shultz has designed ( the plan ) with subtlety , ' ' says Samuel Lewis , former US ambassador to Israel . ' ' It ' s carefully constructed to take account of the Israeli electoral cycle , the American cycle , and the minimal needs of Jordan and the Palestinians.
