" Each British attack earned us authorization to put some units into service , " tho general said , speaking at the inauguration of the French aviation exhibition . " In addition a big effort has been made to , reconstitute the lines of empire interest , which aided powerfully in upholding French sovereignty over her colonial territories . Thus ,  --  the air link between the mother country and Djibuti plays a big part in the magnificent resistance of that colony to British pressure . " The general said - the special ' permission to put more units into service was granted with the view to meeting British attacks .
