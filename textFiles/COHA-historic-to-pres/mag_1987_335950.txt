For 40 years , American warships have been plying the Persian Gulf , symbolizing and substantiating the nation 's role as a global power . Never before , however , have those vital waters seemed so treacherous . By blustering into an open- ended commitment to provide convoy protection to eleven reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers , the U.S. now finds itself embroiled as a halfhearted belligerent in a seven-year-old struggle between Iran and Iraq and once more rattling sabers with Tehran 's fanatic mullahs . <P> Worse yet , the U.S. military again looks like a gawky Goliath , beset by poor planning , faulty conception and just plain bad luck . Last week the Bridgeton , a Kuwaiti tanker now flying the Stars and Stripes , prepared to limp out of the Persian Gulf with a 30-ft. by 10-ft. hole in its hull caused by a mine that caught its American protectors unprepared . Jumbo military transports belatedly began ferrying minesweeping helicopters from Norfolk , Va . A Navy helicopter trying to land on the command ship of the task force crashed , with four Americans presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wake of a protest by Iranian pilgrims that turned into a bloodbath in the Saudi Arabian holy city of Mecca . The week 's events reminded a twitchy U.S. of the very real risks that come with flying the flag in far-flung corners of the world . <P> As the Bridgeton took on oil at week 's end and another reflagged tanker , the Gas Prince , began its return trip with a full load , it was all too clear that the gulf is no place for ill-conceived operations . Had the mine been struck by a U.S. warship instead of the Bridgeton , the result might well have been yet another tragedy , with no easy way to retaliate . Indeed , from its inception , the whole reflagging operation has seemed drawn from Alice 's curiouser and curiouser looking-glass world : <P>  --  Iraq has been responsible for most of the attacks on Persian Gulf shipping , and it was misguided Iraqi missiles that blindsided the U.S.S. Stark in May . But in response , the Reagan Administration lashed out at Iran and pushed its plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuwait . <P>  --  The U.S. appeared to tilt the balance of the war toward Iran with its arms- for-hostages deals . But as the congressional hearings into that fiasco climaxed , the Administration decided to airlift reporters to the region to highlight its efforts to stand firm against Iran . <P>  --  Naval officers in the gulf had predicted that one of the biggest threats to their ships would come from mines . But no minesweeping ships or helicopters were included in the operation . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger conceded that the Pentagon was not prepared for the possibility that the sea-lane skirting the Iranian coast might be mined . " We did not look for mines in that area , " he said , " because there have never been any . " <P>  --  After the Bridgeton was hit , the Navy put the 401,000-ton supertanker out front to protect the three U.S. warships that were supposed to be protecting it . The American vessels , bristling with the latest gear to defend against planes , ships and submarines , could not cope with the World War II-vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd last week . " This patently absurd and ridiculous result of the first escort mission is embarrassing to the nation . "
