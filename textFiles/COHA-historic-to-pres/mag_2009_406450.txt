Some years ago , after Sunday Mass in a small Maine town where my wife and I were vacationing , a middle-aged woman approached and asked if I was a Dinn . I was completely surprised because I was only a visitor and we were a couple of hundred miles from the Boston suburb where I had grown up . The woman , it turned out , had grown up in the same large parish as my family . She had never known me at all and had n't seen any of my family for 40 years . But she picked me out from a crowd of strangers in an unfamiliar place because I reminded her of my father . Somehow at this late stage of my life she saw him in me . The incident especially disarmed me because I was unaware of resembling my father . But it started me thinking about a deeper mystery- that as time passes each of us should be showing a greater resemblance to the Father of us all . We should increasingly embody the val- ues , behavioral traits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of God . There should be a growing commonality between us , a family resemblance that we share with one another . God should shine through us more and more tangibly . Jesus said as much about himself . Near the end of his life he was asked by his disciples to just show them the Father , as if that were the missing piece in their formation . Jesus expressed disappointment that they still did n't know him , adding , " Whoever has seen me has seen the Father " ( John 14:9 ) . The way Jesus listened , spoke , encouraged , forgave , healed , and suffered was the perfect revelation of God in human terms . In our own limited way we should each be able to make that same declaration to our family and friends and co-workers : " If you have seen me , you have seen the Father . " Through our choices , relationships , conversions , and prayers , the Spirit is fine-tuning that resemblance , making us holy . If we are fortunate enough to recognize God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circumstances similar to our own , we are greatly encouraged and fortified in our own cooperation with God . " In the lives of those companions of ours in the human condition who are more perfectly transformed into the image of Christ , God shows , vividly , to humanity his presence and his face , " says Lumen Gentium , the Second Vatican Council 's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church . And , of course , if others see a divine resemblance in us , we become a blessing and support to them . This God-likeness in us is holiness , an unfolding sanctity . It 's the blossoming of our baptismal heritage just as truly as an increased resemblance to our earthly parents is the blossoming of our genetic heritage . Holiness is not our accomplishment ; it 's the Spirit 's gift , the Spirit 's work in us . No regimen of devotions or mortifications , no amount of willpower or discipline can make a person holy . Holiness is godliness , and only God brings it about . We are , St. Paul said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened his first letter to the Christians in Corinth . And he proclaimed the same goal for " all those everywhere who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ " ( 1 Cor. 1:2 ) - quite an astonishing prospect for anyone . If Paul could say it of a tiny enclave of new Christians in a fledgling house church in a free-wheeling pagan port city famous for its prostitutes , it can confidently be said of all Christians . Vatican II echoed Paul in our own time . It insisted that every member of the church is called to holiness , a holiness " expressed in many ways , " which is " a source of edification for others , " according to Lumen Gentium . This perspective puts holiness or " sainthood " more obviously within the reach of the ordinary believer . It counters the sense of remoteness and unattainability that so often characterizes the holiness of the canonized saints we are invited to venerate . The very canonization process that selects and validates them seems to preclude anyone from our neighborhood or family tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent stars in our night sky : named and charted and grouped into familiar constellations . But this mapped , selective view of our sky , awesome though it may be , fades to insignificance beside the star-studded universe glimpsed in recent years through the Hubble Telescope . There is so much more than we ever imag- ined . Surely if we could see through God 's eyes the profusion of uncanonized saints ( mostly ordinary lay believers ) and the incredible varieties of holiness to which God has led them , we really would n't care anymore who made or missed the canonized list . The varieties of holiness , the countless ways that persons bear a family resemblance to God , reflect the individuality and uniqueness of his children . Our Father is not interested in clones or mass production . He invites and shapes each of us through the particular subtleties of our genetics , the impact of our experiences , and the tangles of our motivations and thought processes . Like most people , I have seen holiness forged in pain or rooted in scripture or born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiness of searchers and dreamers and penitents . I have felt awe at the holiness of questioners , activists , and devout believers . A person 's holiness may strike us as wisdom , piety , generosity , justice , forgiveness , love , or any other virtue . Every day we get glimpses of the Father in those around us . And we need their variety and distinctiveness because no one of us adequately or consistently reveals God to others . These are some of the saints I know and the glimpse they give me of God : Mike with his unfailing pleasantness and flexibility , the simple prayerfulness of Ellen in chapel , the contagious laughter of Ed , the tireless helpfulness of Tina to everyone , the uncomplaining suffering of Marge , bedridden Carla 's patience year after year , Als concern at Mass or social gatherings that nobody gets neglected , Bob 's inchisiveness and empathy , Sally and the joy she finds in sharing humorous anecdotes , the creative thoughtfulness of Andrea , and the gentle attentiveness of Bill to his wife , who is speechless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives **38;3081;TOOLONG . They are not officially certified for public veneration and intercession . But they are no less precious and helpful as God-given models for our lives . After all , our call is not to canonization . Rather the church extends to us the universal call to holiness , the call rooted in the gospel invitation of Jesus to " be perfect just as your heavenly Father is perfect " ( Matt. 5:48 ) . That same Father reveals himself to us not only in the lofty example of the canonized saints but in the unpretentious holiness of the ordinary people around us . And God wants to reveal himself to those same people through us . I heard a priest , speaking at his father 's funeral , recall how the limited resources of his parents had been stretched when the children were young . But once in a while his father would walk his only son to the hot dog vendor for the boy to order whatever he wanted with all the trimmings . His father paid for it and for the drink with the loose change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the outdoor table where the boy relished the hot dog and chocolate milk . There was n't enough money for his father to treat himself as well . But the father basked in the joy of his son . Each time the boy looked up , his father was just sitting there watching him , beaming with delight . Now , as an adult looking back , the priest said he had come to realize what his father had done for him - he had shown him the face of God . May we all be so blessed by our family , our friends , and our neighbors.
