from The Feast of Love <p> As a Jew , I am drawn in a suicidal manner toward the maddest of Christians . Kierkegaard , being one of the craziest and most lovable of the lot , and , therefore , dialectically , possibly the most sane of them all , is of compelling interest to me . All my life , I have tracked his ghost doggedly through the snow . Lonely , eccentric , and deranged , the man Kierkegaard ( 1813-1855 ) was drawn to philosophize about matters concerning which one can not acquire any certainty whatsoever . Kierkegaard worried continuously about the mode in which one might think , or could think , about two unknowns : God and love . These were for the hapless Kierkegaard the most compelling topics . They bound him in tantalizing straps . Of the two vast subjects about which one can never be certain and should therefore perhaps keep silent , God and love , Kierkegaard , a bachelor , claimed especial expertise . Kierkegaard 's homage to both was multifarious verbiage . He wrote intricately beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I learned Danish in order to read Kierkegaard . His picture is on the wall in my study . I can not write a word without his image up there , looking down at me . <p> As a member of the bourgeoisie , which is what I am , I live quietly in Ann Arbor , Michigan , a city of ghosts and mutterers . Everywhere you go in this town , you hear people muttering . Often this is brilliant muttering , tenurable muttering , but that is not my point . All these mini-vocalizations are the effect of the local university , the Amalgamated Education Corporation , as I call it , my employer . It is in the nature of universities to promote ideas that should not be put to use , whose glories must reside exclusively in the cranium . Therefore the muttering . There are exceptions , of course . The multimillionaire lawyers and doctors and engineers-how did they get into the university in the first place ? - live here among us in their , to quote Cole Porter , stinking pink palazzos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with horsepower . The warped personalities , like myself , like my prey Kierkegaard , walk hunched over and unnoticed , or we wait at the bus stops , managing our intricate and tiny mental kingdoms as the rain falls on our unhatted heads . We wait for the millennium and for Elijah . <p> I live next door to Bradley W. Smith . I see him walking his dog , also called Bradley . What is this , that a man should name his dog after himself ? The man runs a local coffee franchise , a modest achievement , in all truth . Megalomania can strike anywhere , I suppose is the point . <p> After he lost his second wife to another man , I decided to explain to him about Kierkegaard . In doing so , I first used the example of myself . <p> My wife is Esther , a tough bird , the love of my existence . She works as a biochemist for one of the local drug companies . It was Esther who years ago found out that the wonder medication Thalidomide deformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took away toes and fingers and entire arms . If Esther 's mother had n't joined the Party as a young woman ( and who else but the Reds were trying to desegregate the public beaches in those days ? who else had a single social idea worth implementing ? ) , and had n't dressed Esther in red diapers , and had n't signed Esther up for the Party as a child , she would have been proclaimed , my Esther , from the rooftops . But somehow , in the shower of publicity , some measuring worm looked up her background , and , though Esther as a youngster was blameless , and not a Leninist but a reader of Trotsky , that was that . <p> We live , in all truth , a tranquil domestic life . We have a year or two to go before retirement . Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays , I cook dinner . My specialty is a beef burgundy , very tasty , you have to remember to cook it slowly , covered , of course , in the liquids so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender . Tuesday and Thursdays are the nights when Esther cooks . We read , we talk , we play canasta and Scrabble . We feed the two goldfish , Julius and Ethel . They must live . <p> As is proper , the children-all grown-have left home . We have three . The oldest , our beautiful daughter , Sarah , is , like her mother , a biochemist . She is successful but , so far , unmarried . She would be a handful for any man . I mean this as praise and description . The middle one , Ephraim , is a mathematician and father to three wonderful little ones , our grandchildren . I have pictures here somewhere . Of the youngest , Aaron , who is crazy , I should not speak . And not because he blames me for the mess in his head . No : he deserves to be left alone with his commonplace lunacies-he calls them ideas-and given peace . He lives , it goes without saying , in Los Angeles . <p> After Kathryn , Bradley 's first wife-a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a manager of a local coffee shop and subsequently bought the house next door . He became our neighbor . He moved into the haunted house adjacent to ours , haunted not by ghosts but divorce . There was a divorce dybbuk living inside the woodwork . Young couples would purchase that property , they would take up occupancy , they would quarrel , the quarreling would escalate to shouting and table pounding , they would anathematize each other , and , presto , they would move out , not together , but separately . They would scatter . Then back it would go onto the real estate market . Three couples we saw this happen to . <p> I should explain . At first sight , each time they arrived , they were fine scrubbed American pragmatists you might see photographed in a glossy magazine . Blond , blue-eyed Rotarians , fresh owners of real estate , Hemingway readers , they would unload their cheerful sunny furniture from U-Haul vans . By the time they moved out , they would have acquired mottled gray skin and haggard Eastern European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greenish appearance of owl-eyed Soviet refugees stumbling out of Aeroflot . Well , of course domesticity is not for every taste , but these young families emerged from that house bent and broken , like vegetables left forgotten in the crisper . <p> So , when Bradley arrived , alone except for his dog , we thought : The curse is over . The dybbuk will have to locate itself elsewhere . That was until Bradley met and married Diana . But I am getting ahead of myself . <p> This Bradley , an interesting man , invited Esther and me to dinner the second week he was installed in that house . A courageous gesture . He was not afraid of Jews . He served veal , which Esther will not eat . In the dining room , she picked at it delicately . She left small scraps of it distributed randomly around her plate . I said later , At least no ham , no pork , no shrimp mousse , no trayf . But Harry , she said , veal to me is like a frozen scream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat it , I said . So I do n't , she said . So ? <p> The man , Bradley , had a certain hangdog diffuseness characteristic of the recently divorced . But he was trying against certain odds to be cheerful . He asked me about my work , he asked Esther about her work , and he listened pleasantly while we did our best to explain . These topics do not provide good conversation . He listened , though . He had large watchful eyes . I was reminded of an extremely handsome toad , a toad with class and style and good tailoring . He seemed to be living far down inside himself , perhaps in a secret passageway connected to his heart . Biochemistry does not scintillate at the dinner table , however , nor do neo-Kantian aesthetics . Only when I mentioned Kierkegaard did Bradley perk up . From behind a locked bedroom door , his dog simultaneously barked . I assumed that the dog had caught sight of the dybbuk or was interested in Kierkegaard . <p> Prompted by his interest , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlucky and boorish in love . He had fallen in love with an attractive girl , Regine Olsen , and then he had concluded that they would be incompatible , that the love was mistaken , that he himself was complex and she was simple , and he contrived to break the engagement so as to give the appearance that it was the young lady 's fault , not his . <p> He succeeded at least in breaking the engagement , in never marrying her . Cowardice familiar to many young men was probably involved here . Kierkegaard wished to believe that the fault lay with the nature of love itself , the problem of love , its fate in his life . From the personal he extrapolated to the general . A philosopher 's trick . Regine married another man and moved away from Copenhagen to the West Indies , but Kierkegaard , the knight of faith , carried a burning torch , in the form of his philosophy , for her the rest of his days . This is madness of a complex lifelong variety . He spent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify his actions toward Regine Olsen . He died of a warped spine . <p> Esther says that when I am seated at a dinner table , plates and food in front of me , I am transmogrified into a bore . Yak yak , she says . At the table she adjusted her watchband and raised her eyebrows to me . I felt her kicking me in the shins . Still I pressed on . <p> Soren Kierkegaard maintained that everyone experiences love , everyone knows what it is intuitively , and yet it can not be spoken of directly . Or distinctly . It falls into the category of the unknown , where plain speech is inadequate to the obscurity of the subject . Similarly , everyone experiences God , but the experience of God is so unlike the rest of our experiences that there , too , plain speech is defeated . According to Kierkegaard , nearly everyone intuits the subtlety of God , but almost no one knows how to speak of Him . This is where our troubles begin . <p> At this point I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She glanced toward Bradley , our new neighbor . Do n't lecture the boy , she meant . <p> I raised my voice to keep his attention . Speaking about God is not , I said , pounding the dinner table lightly with my fist for emphasis , the same as talking about car dealerships or Phillips screwdrivers . The salt and pepper shakers clattered . The problem with love and God , the two of them , is how to say anything about them that does n't annihilate them instantly with the wrong words , with untruth . In The Philosophical Fragments , Kierkegaard points out that the wrong words destroy love in a way that waiting for one 's lover , delaying consummation , never can . In this sense , love and God are equivalents . We feel both , but because we can not speak clearly about them , we end up-wordless , inarticulate-by denying their existence altogether , and , pfffft , they die . ( They can , however , come back . Because God is a god , when He is dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back if He chooses to . Nietzsche somehow failed to mention this . ) <p> Both God and love are best described and addressed by means of poetry . Poetry , however , is also stone dead at the present time , like its first cousin , God . Love will very quickly follow , no ? Hmm ? Do n't you agree ? I asked . After God dies , must love , a smaller god , not follow ? <p> Uh , I do n't know . I 'll have to think about it . Do you want some dessert , professor ? Bradley , our new neighbor , asked . I got some ice cream here in the refrigerator . It 's chocolate . <p> A very nice change of subject , Esther said , breathless with relief . Harry , she continued , I think you should save Kierkegaard for some other time . For perhaps another party . A party with more Ph.D 's . <p> She gave me a loving but boldly impatient look , perfected from a lifetime of practice . Esther does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels implicated . <p> Okay , I said , I 'm sorry . I get going , and I ca n't help myself . I 'm like a man trying to rid himself of an obsession . Actually , I am that man . I 'm not like him at all . <p> Esther turned toward Bradley Smith . Harry , she said , is on the outs in his department . He does all the unfashionable philosophers , he 's a baggage handler of Bigthink . What do you do , again , Mr. Smith ? You explained , but I forgot . <p> Well , he said , I 've just bought into a coffee shop in the mall , I have a partnership , and now I 'm managing it . This interested me because I 've always wanted to open a restaurant . <p> Also , he continued , I 'm an artist . I paint pictures . There was an appreciable pause in the conversation while Esther and I took this in . Would you like to see my paintings ? he asked . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on the living room wall . <p> Esther appeared discountenanced but recovered herself quickly . The artwork he had indicated had a great deal of open space in it . The painting itself covered much of the wall . However , three quarters of the canvas appeared to be vacant . It was like undeveloped commercial property . It had n't even been compromised with white paint . It was just unfulfilled canvas . Perhaps the open space was a commentary on what was there . In the upper righthand corner of the picture , though , was the appearance of a window , or what might have been a window if you were disposed to think of it representationally . Through this window you could discern , distantly , a patch of green-which I took to be a fieldand in the center of this green , one could construe a figure . A figure of sorts . Unmistakably a woman . <p> Who 's that ? I asked . <p> The painting 's called Synergy#1 , Bradley said . <p> Okay , but who 's that ? <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you thinking of ? <p> Oh , it 's just an abstract person . <p> Esther laughed . Bradley , she said , I never heard of an abstract person before . Except for the persons that my husband thinks of professionally . Example-persons , for example . <p> Well , this one is . Abstract , I mean . <p> It looks like a woman to me , Esther said . Viewed from a distance . As long as it 's a woman , it 's not abstract . <p> Well , maybe she 's on the way to becoming abstract . <p> Oh , you mean , as if she 's all women ? A symbol for women ? There she is , not a woman but all women , wrapped up in one woman , there in the distance ? <p> Maybe . <p> Well , Esther said , I do n't like that . No such thing as Woman . Just women , and a woman , such as me , for example , clomping around in my mud boots . But that 's not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do like it . <p> Thank you . I have n't sold it yet . <p> I like the window , Esther continued , and all those scrappy unpainted areas . <p> It 's not quite unpainted , he informed us . It 's underpainted . I splashed some coffee on the canvas to stain it . Blend-of-the-day coffee from the place where I work . It 's a statement . You just ca n't see the stains from here . <p> Ah , I said , nodding . A statement about capitalism ? Esther glared at me . <p> You want to see my pictures in the basement ? Bradley asked . <p> Sure , I said , why not ? <p> Only thing is , he said , there 're some yellow jackets nesting in the walls-or wasps-and you 'll have to watch yourself when you get down there . Careful not to get stung . <p> We 'll do that , I said . <p> About this basement and the paintings residing there , what can I say ? I held Esther 's hand as we descended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likewise , were on my mind . I did not want to have her stung and would protect her if necessary . Bradley had located his paintings along the walls , as painters do , on the floor , leaning . Each painting leaned into another like derelicts reclining against other derelicts . He had installed a fervent showering bath of fluorescent light overhead . A quantity of light like that will give you a headache if you 're inclined , as I am , toward pain . The basement smelled of turpentine and paint substances , the pleasant sinus-clearing elemental ingredients of art , backed by the more pessimistic odors of sub-surface cellar mold and mildew . <p> One by one he brought out his visions . <p> This , he said , is Composition in Gray and Black . <p> He held up , for our inspection , images of syphilis and gonorrhea . <p> And this , he said , is called Free Weights . <p> Very interesting , Esther said , scratching her nose with a pencil she had found somewhere , as she contemplated our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like acorns , from badly imagined and executed surrealist trees , growing in a forest of fog and painterly confusion that no revision could hope to clarify . <p> And here , he said , lugging out a larger canvas from behind the others , is a different sort of picture . In my former style . He placed it before us . <p> Until that moment I had thought the boy , our neighbor , a dumb bunny . This painting was breath-snatching . What 's this called ? I asked him . <p> I call it The Feast of Love , Bradley said . In contrast to his other paintings , which appeared to have been slopped over with mud and coffee grounds , this one , this feast of love , consisted of color . A sunlit table-on which had been set dishes and cups and glasses-appeared to be overflowing with light . The table and the feast had been placed in the foreground , and on all sides the background fell backward into a sort of visible darkness . The eye returned to the table . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates were dishes of the brightest hues , as if the appetite the guest brought to this feast was an appetite not for food but for the entire spectrum as lit by celestial arc lamps . The food had no shape . It only had color , burning pastels , of the pale but intense variety . Spooky magic flowed from one end of the table to the other , all the suggestions of food having been abstracted into too-bright shapes , as if one had stepped out of a movie theater into a bright afternoon summer downtown where all the objects were so overcrowded with light that the eye could n't process any of it . The painting was like a flashbulb , a blinding , cataract art . This food laid out before us was like that . Then I noticed that the front of the table seemed to be tipped toward the viewer , as if all this light , and all this food , and all this love , was about to slide into our laps . The feast of love was the feast of light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed : Oh oh oh . It 's beautiful . And then she said , Where are the people ? <p> There are n't any , Bradley told her . <p> Why not ? <p> Because , he said , no one 's ever allowed to go there . You can see it , but you ca n't reach it . <p> Now it was my turn to scratch my balding head . Bradley , I barked at him , this is not like your other paintings , this is magnificent , why do you hide such things ? <p> Because it 's not true , he said . <p> What do you mean , it 's not true ? Of course it 's true , if you can paint it . <p> No , he said , still looking fixedly at his creation . If you ca n't get there , then it 's not true . He looked up at me and Esther , two old people holding hands in our neighbor 's basement . I 'm not a fool , he said . I do n't spend my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I could have argued with him but chose not to . <p> And with that , he picked up the painting and hid it behind the silly ugly dumbbells growing like acorns on psychotic trees . <p> What a strange young man , Esther said , tucked in next to me , several hours later , sleepy but sleepless in the dark . Her nightgown swished as she tossed and turned . He seems so nondescript and Midwestern , harmless , and then he produces from the back of his basement a picture that anyone would remember for the rest of their lives . <p> Oh , I said , you could say it 's imitation-Matisse or imitationHockney . Besides , I said , light as a subject for contemporary paintings is passe . <p> You could say that , Esther whispered , but you would n't , and if you did , you 'd be wrong . <p> She gave me a little playful slap . <p> I only said that you could say that , not that you would . <p> You did n't actually say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther said . I realized that she was agitated . I turned to her and rubbed her back and her neck , and she put her hands on my face . I could feel her smiling in the darkness . I could feel her wrinkles rising . <p> Harry , she said , it was a recognition for me , a moment of beauty . How strange that a wonderful painting should be created by such a seemingly mediocre man . Our neighbor , living in the Dybbuk House . How strange , how strange . Then she sighed . How strange , she said again . <p> Then the phone rang . <p> Do n't answer it , Esther quickly said . You must n't . Do n't , dear , do n't , do n't , do n't . <p> No , I must , I told her . I must . <p> I picked up the telephone receiver and said hello . From across the continent , on the West Coast , my son Aaron began speaking to me . In a voice tireless with rage , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again I was invited to hear the story of how I had ruined his life , destroyed his soul , sacrificed him to the devils and angels of lost ambition . In numbing fashion he found words to batter my heart . Indictment : I had expected more of him than he could achieve . Indictment : I had had hopes for him that drove him , he said , insane . Indictment : I was who I was . Crazy , sick , and inspired with malice , he described his craziness and his sickness in detail , his terrible impulses to hurt others and to hurt himself , as if I had not heard this story many times before , several times , innumerable times . Razors , wire , gas . He called me , his father , a motherfucker . Then he broke down in tears and asked for money . Demanded money . From the nothingness and everlasting night of his life , he demanded cash . I , too , was weeping with sorrow and rage , holding the earpiece tightly to my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Esther . Cupping my hand around the mouthpiece , I asked him if he had hurt anyone , if he had hurt himself , and he said no , but he was thinking about it , he planned every single minute in advance , he planned monstrous personal calamities , he needed help , he would ask for help , but first he had to have money now , this very minute , my money , superhuman quantities of it . Do n't make me your sacrificial lamp , he said , then corrected himself , sacrificial lamb , do n't you do that now , not again . I said , against my better judgement , that I would see what I could do , I would send him what I had . He seemed briefly calm . He breathed in and out . He pleasantly wished me goodnight , as if at the conclusion of an effective performance . <p> To have a son or daughter like this is to have a portion of the spirit shrivel and die , never to recover . You witness the lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternity . Ethics is a dream , and tenderness a daytime phantasm , lost when night comes . Esther and I , eyes open , held each other until dawn broke . My darling wept in my arms , our hearts in ruin . We live in a large city , populated only by ourselves . <p> Kafka : A false alarm on the night bell once answered-it can not be made good , not ever . <p>
