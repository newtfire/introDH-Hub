Basically , it ' s the story of the kind of morally questionable but sadly familiar relationship that Hollywood has often dealt with over the years : a love triangle involving a husband , a wife , and the ' ' best friend ' ' she ' s having an affair with . Pinter gives the situation a bravura twist , though , telling the tale backward . After a wordless and stunningly filmed introduction , the first scene shows the adulterous couple hashing over their past , long after the fling has ended . Subsequent scenes trace the affair back through the years , ending with their very first romantic encounter. // It ' s a bold way to shed new light on familiar territory , and Pinter makes it work surpassingly well . Instead of plot suspense - Will the lovers be caught ? Will they tire of each other ? - there ' s an emotional tension that springs from our knowledge of what will happen , as well as our ignorance of what has happened . The result is a deftly tangled web of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Adding to the fascination is Pinter ' s evocative language , combined with tactful treatment ( the R rating reflects a couple of vulgar words ) and the zestful performances of an excellent cast . As the woman of the piece , Patricia Hodge has an apt mixture of force and vulnerability . As her lover , Jeremy Irons is smooth but never slick , engaging our full attention without having to reach for it . Ben Kingsley , also the star of ' ' Gandhi , ' ' is somewhere near perfect with his gentle , wry , faintly menacing portrayal of the betrayed husband who also does his share of betraying. // It ' s a splendid instance of ensemble acting , finely tuned and utterly at one with its material . Credit goes to all concerned , including director David Jones , who coached the fine performers and - as he acknowledged when I met him in New York shortly before the film ' s premiere - took care not to let Pinter ' s portentous reputation , and delicately balanced prose , dissuade him from bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <> <> Distinguished producer // Among its other assets , ' ' Betrayal ' ' boasts one of the most distinguised producers in Hollywood history : Sam Spiegel , the nearly legendary showman whose career has ranged from ' ' The African Queen ' ' and ' ' On the Waterfront ' ' to ' ' Lawrence of Arabia ' ' and ' ' Bridge on the River Kwai. ' ' // Spiegel visited here recently to launch his new picture , and I spoke with him at length in his posh hotel room - which he amiably apologized for , posh or not , as being the kind of ' ' sterile ' ' place he ' s as happy to leave as to arrive in . I began by asking how he got involved with a project as intimate , compared with many of his other pictures , as Pinter ' s three-character domestic drama. // Speaking in his elegant accent - echoing his Viennese youth and early work in Berlin during the 1930s - Spiegel replied that he has worked on a small canvas before , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn to ' ' Betrayal ' ' by his 20-year friendship with Pinter , and by his feeling that the London and Broadway productions of the play could be improved upon. // ' ' You need electrifying actors , and the casting was too flat in London , ' ' he says . As for the New York edition , ' ' The performers were American , and had more trouble being British than playing the parts ! ' ' So he began discussing a movie version with Mike Nichols , who later dropped out and was replaced by debuting filmmaker David Jones. // Once the project was under way , Spiegel stayed on top of it , as is his custom . ' ' Harold and I spent months on the script , acquainting the director with every aspect of it , ' ' he recalls . ' ' And I was involved in the casting and all that. ' ' // Then he stepped back a bit . ' ' Once a director starts shooting , I never look over his shoulder , because it could be intimidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous day ' s footage every morning , ' ' and if I felt anything needed retaking or changing , I met with the director right away . I also spent a great deal of time with the editing. ' ' // Though the structure of ' ' Betrayal ' ' is unusual , Spiegel considers it essentially a realistic drama . ' ' There ' s a lot to identify with , ' ' he says . ' ' You could see it cynically , and say it ' s about the mortality of love . But really , it ' s saying that relationships aren ' t always on the same level . They can develop from one type of affection to another - including friendship , comradeship , liking instead of loving , and just enjoying each other. // ' ' But when a relationship changes , ' ' he continues , ' ' it has to be done with honesty . If you betray that honesty , you ruin things . That ' s the morality tale of the film , in my eyes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perishable if faced with betrayal - people not being honest with themselves or with each other. ' ' // Before embarking on ' ' Betrayal ' ' in 1980 , when he and Pinter first discussed it , Spiegel had not produced any films in several years . Asked about his absence , he says it was voluntary . ' ' I haven ' t wanted to make a picture for some time , ' ' he explains , adding that he has been ' ' alienated by the type of movie in vogue now. ' ' // Expanding on his feelings , Spiegel paints a sad but largely accurate portrait of the current movie scene . ' ' People have lost their ability to hear , ' ' he says . ' ' They don ' t listen to dialogue - they ' re benumbed by the sound of crashing cars and shooting guns . The lure of language , the beauty and nuance of language , has disappeared from movies. ' ' // ' ' So in the last few years I lost the joy of making movies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues , with obvious feeling . ' ' If I did go to a film , I ' d be livid with rage on occasion - I couldn ' t sleep afterward , I was so disheartened . Just look at the kind of pictures that have won the Academy Award in the past 10 or 15 years . The first year I got really upset was when ' The French Connection ' won . This mediocre picture was the best thing moviemakers could create in the Western world , Western culture , Western civilization ? Just 25 years ago , Warner Bros. used to make six of these a month ! ' ' // Spiegel agrees , though , that moviegoers must share the guilt with moviemakers . ' ' It ' s a vicious circle , ' ' he opines . ' ' Everyone gets used to a certain style . For example , people have ceased reading and writing . They don ' t even write letters , because they prefer the telex and telephone . Who writes letters like , say , Noel Coward anymore - so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That ' s all gone . Even he would probably use the telex and telephone today ! ' ' // Much of the blame , in Spiegel ' s view , goes to ' ' the influence of television , ' ' which began ' ' this trend of lowering the appetite for quality . ' ' Motion pictures ' ' should have fought the style of television with a kind of quality television can ' t afford , ' ' he says . ' ' Then the movies would have survived much better . But instead , they followed the trend , and supplied even more violence than television could generate by itself. ' ' // How did this unfortunate situation start ? TV producers , in Spiegel ' s view , ' ' had to feed the monster of the tube 24 hours a day . And much of it had to be trash , because you can ' t make beautiful material in such quantities . So you constantly reduce the quality , and this is self-perpetuating . Then cinema is needed to replenish the monster with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard . And their children , instead of reading books , grow up reading trash on that screen. // ' ' Also , the people who make pictures today are not literate enough . All kinds of agents have become moviemakers . But they ' re not really moviemakers . They ' re packagers. ' ' // Hard words . Yet the act of producing ' ' Betrayal ' ' shows a basic optimism in Spiegel that refuses to die . He still feels there is a hungry audience out there , craving literate and intelligent entertainment . His wish to ' ' lure back ' ' that audience - and his desire to make a film he could be proud of , regardless of commercial success - were what spurred him toward his Pinter project. // Is he as pleased with ' ' Betrayal ' ' as he hoped to be ? ' ' At the end , ' ' he says , ' ' you always find a little less on the screen than you dreamed of . Every picture would be infinitely better if you could entirely reshoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s obviously impossible . So if you come very close to what you imagined , you ought to be quite happy . And , ' ' he concludes , happily summing up his career , ' ' I ' ve had the good fortune to come very close on quite a number of occasions . . . . ' ' <> <> The film set as reality // There ' s often a strange atmosphere at a ' ' location ' ' where a movie is being shot . You can feel the excitement and concentration of the filmmakers and performers . Yet there ' s so much **28;15839; waiting <> all the time - for lights to be arranged , cameras to be moved , actors to be rehearsed. . . . // In his brilliant new film , The State of Things , director Wim Wenders carries this situation to extravagant heights , using it as a gloomy metaphor for the artistic process and perhaps the human condition itself. // The characters are a movie crew , on location at a desolate Portuguese hotel , shooting a science-fiction drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until one gray day when they stumble against the ultimate cinematic embarrassment : running out of film . An emissary leaves for Hollywood to find out why money and supplies have mysteriously dried up . Meanwhile , everybody waits and waits and waits. // On paper , it sounds like a dreary dose of existential **28;15869; angst . <> On the screen , it ' s far more . True , not much happens , and some of what does happen is trite - moping , some vulgar whining , a little forlorn sex . What takes over and makes the film soar is its exquisitely sustained mood , its relentless portrait of a supercharged tension between creation and ennui. // Its slow , steady rhythms are engulfing and irresistible ; watching it is like hearing an adagio that refuses to end , somehow captivating the listener as surely in its second hour as in its first . When the picture finally does shift gears - with a burst of stunning , absurdist melodrama in the last half hour - it ' s both a relief and a letdown after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' The State of Things ' ' is a reflection of Wenders ' s own mood when it was made , during a hiatus when his long-awaited Hollywood production , ' ' Hammett , ' ' had apparently bogged down . But a strong share of credit must also go to his collaborators , including co-writer Robert Kramer and cinematographer Henri Alekan , whose somber black-and-white images are the film ' s most astonishing virtue . The cast includes a mixed bag of talents , from Allen Goorwitz and Viva to filmmakers-cum-actors Samuel Fuller and Roger Corman. // In all , a most unexpected enterprise , quite surpassing the somewhat similar film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder called ' ' Beware of a Holy Whore . ' ' Although its commercial prospects are dubious , it rousingly confirms the big-league status of Wenders , already one of West Germany ' s most promising contributions to world cinema. // //
