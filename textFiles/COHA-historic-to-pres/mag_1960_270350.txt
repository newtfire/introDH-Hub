" Let 's call this an average year - but the best average year we 've ever had . " With this wry preface , Chairman Roger Blough last week announced that U.S. Steel sales of $1,187,554,615 for the first three months of 1960 had set a first-quarter record , disclosed that Big Steel 's output ( 94.1% of capacity ) had set a record for any quarter . <P> Blough 's words were a pointed comment on the gloomy state of mind of many U.S. businessmen , though of course Steel 's first quarter reflected pent-up buyer demands after 1959 's nearly 17-week-long strike . But for many other companies , business had never been so good - or at least , so big . With first-quarter reports from some 400 of the biggest U.S. companies in by last week , earnings on the average were up 6% . Seldom had there been so much discontent with good news , or such readiness to emphasize the weak spots . On the day Big Steel announced its gains , its stock dropped 1 to hit a new 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of $3.657,972,071 , a record for any quarter in its history , with profits of $324 million . But G.M. stock only held even , dropped by week 's end . After American Motors announced record March quarter net profits of $14 million , with earnings of 80 ( up from 70 a year ago ) , the stock promptly fell off i . Wall Street 's explanation : brokers had been counting on earnings up to $1 a share . <P> Part of businessmen 's uneasy mood could be traced to a real cost squeeze that had turned a higher gross into a smaller net for many a company . Chrysler , despite a sharp rise in sales ( $925.8 million v. $690.5 million in 1959 ) reported a first-quarter earnings decline of 28% ( $1.25 a share v. $1.75 ) . There was also doubt about whether the economy was going to sustain its present pace . Manufacturers ' new orders in March dropped $500 million under the previous month , lagged behind shipments . <P> On the bright side was a McGraw-Hill survey taken last month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 . It still showed that capital outlays will rise 16% this year to a record $37.9 billion . This was 6% more than outlay plans made last fall , indicating that pessimism had not yet affected expansion , that management was often more sanguine than investors . <P> But the stock market was suffering the pangs of disappointment and uncertainty , and waited for a sure sign of the economy 's course . Monthly trading on the New York Stock Exchange slacked until volume hit an eight-month low . Despite sporadic rallies , each day the market closed lower than the day before . At week 's end the Dow-Jones industrial average was off 14.72 points , closed at 601.70 , only a shade above the year 's low point .
