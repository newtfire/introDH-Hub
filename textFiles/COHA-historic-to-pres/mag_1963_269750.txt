Only the doctors and nurses specially assigned to the new unit at Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Center were allowed to enter it , and even they had to " scrub up " first and put on a sterile gown , cap and mask . Lining the pale green wall was a row of Plexiglas-covered incubators . The babies who wriggled and squeaked in them last week were being treated like miniature maharajahs , with the most expert and intensive care around the clock . To diaper them with out changing the balmy temperature of their isolation , nurses worked through armholes in the incubator sides . Some of the babies were no bigger than a man 's two fists , and all were tiny . Since their weight at birth was less than 5 Ibs. , they were classed as premature. * From these wrinkled , red blobs of humanity , investigators at the Clinical Research Center for Premature Infants hope to glean basic medical knowledge to be applied in the saving , care and feeding of preemies everywhere . <P> Historic Hiccup . Half a century ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing they could do to prevent it . Now all major U.S. hospitals have special incubator units for them , and the death rate has been drastically reduced . But it is still 17.3% , or 20 times as high as that for normal babies . If that death rate is to be reduced still further , medical scientists must have new , fundamental facts . <P> Conceived by Stanford 's imaginative Professor of Pediatrics Dr. Norman Kretchmer and Dr. Sumner Yaffe , the new unit on the third floor of the Stanford Medical Center ( whose ornate design by Architect Edward Stone leads townsfolk to call it the " Taj Mahal " ) is intended to win that kind of basic knowledge . Since Dr. Kretchmer and his colleagues want data that can be applied to all premature babies , they are studying an average run of preemies . Most are normal except for their size , though last week one had to be fed by a tube leading directly into its stomach through an incision above the navel . It hiccuped constantly , prompting a nurse to remark : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause hiccups - that little fellow never swallowed anything in his life . " <P> One research project will investigate the phenomenon by which the infant makes energy by metabolizing only sugars in the first 36 hours of life , then apparently switches over to fats and proteins . At the same time , instead of exhaling only as much carbon dioxide as the oxygen it inhales , the newborn child begins to change the ratio and soon puts out ten volumes of CO for seven volumes of inhaled oxygen . Nobody understands just why , but with uncannily delicate instruments , which will measure gas ratios to an accuracy of one part in a million , the Stanford researchers hope to learn more about it . And then , more important , they hope to use this knowledge in setting ideal oxygen concentrations for babies in different stages of prematurity. * <P> Incubator Emotions ? Another puzzle under study at Stanford involves the workings of the brain of an infant ejected prematurely from the womb . Its electrical discharges are different from those of a full-term baby 's brain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , Dr. Kretchmer 's group has devised a special electroencephalograph connected to babies ' heads .
