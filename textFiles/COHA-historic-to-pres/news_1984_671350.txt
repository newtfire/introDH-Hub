By the end of the week , the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into suggestions of impropriety raised by traders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange . That exchange and the New York Stock Exchange were also examining the matter , and late in the week , the American Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange joined in. // The substance of the charges was that several large brokerage houses could have bought such large blocks of stock on the Big Board that they pushed up the S. &; P. index by a point and a half in just a few minutes at the end of trading April 19 . This left traders in index options with the need to cover positions they had sold earlier in the day. // But such manipulation , if it took place , would have required tens of millions of dollars , and there is a lot of skepticism about the allegations. // Most of the allegations , perhaps not surprisingly , have come from traders who lost money. // Today , the stress came to the fore . Some normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few who would talk refused to discuss the investigations or the disputed trading patterns . Relations between traders in Chicago and brokerage officials in New York , who are often at odds with each other , seemed to be more barbed than usual. // <> <> Looking for Changes // All the parties , however , seemed to agree that new regulations or redesigned indexes that are more nearly tamper-proof may emerge. // Many say that the adverse publicity is too sensational and thus may do irreparable harm to a financial instrument that was being hailed by the options exchanges as the hottest trading product of the 1980 ' s. // " It has all been terribly overblown , " says Howard Brenner , executive vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and chairman of the Securities Industry Association ' s stock-index committee . " I think there are a lot of crybabies on the floor of the C.B.O.E. Nobody asked them to go out and sell options. " // The Chicago options traders were the first to cry foul . Many of them lost huge sums in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders act much as specialists do on stock exchanges , buying selectively when someone wants to sell and selling to match " buy " orders. // Early on April 19 , the S. &; P. 100 index of stock prices seemed to be sticking stubbornly below the 155 level . This made the sale of call options for the April 155 contract appear a good idea . A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a futures contract at a stated price within a certain period , and the April 155 contract was due to be settled in cash at the end of that day. // But on the stock market , with trading unusually light before the Good Friday holiday , the trend changed abruptly when large blocks of General Motors , General Electric , International Business Machines , Exxon , Eastman Kodak and Standard Oil ( Indiana ) crossed the Big Board ' s tape in the last hour of trading . The block trades pushed the S. &; P. 100 to 155. 78 , from a daily low of 154. 34. // The traders who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in effect , selling contracts for less than they had to pay for them. // " Traders are always disgruntled when a volatile market moves against them , " said John Stassen , an attorney with Kirkland &; Ellis who specializes in stock-index financial products . " All of a sudden the market moves against them and they go home and tell the wife and kids sinister forces are at work . " He dismissed the idea that there was a concerted effort to manipulate the averages . " It would require an extraordinary undertaking of capital to move the S. &; P. 100 index , " he said. // If someone had tried to manipulate the S. &; P. 100 options market , it would have cost $53. 2 million to buy the blocks in question . About 57 , 170 of the options changed hands that day , allowing a maximum potential profit ( if someone bought all the calls at their lowest and sold them at their highest ) of about $4. 1 million. // A Chicago trader , Robert Cruikshank , said : " Sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , or say about $2. 5 million on Monday morning , and still come out ahead. " // He said trader complaints were more than sour grapes . " Everyday somebody here loses big money and you don ' t hear anything about it , " he said . " In this case , if someone took advantage of them illegally , they ' re whistle blowers , not crybabies. " // <> <> It ' Couldn ' t Be Hidden ' // Among the people who think that there might have been an overt attempt at manipulation , there is the feeling that the attempt failed because of the publicity and that any wrongdoers will be discovered and punished. // " It ' s something that couldn ' t be hidden , " said Ira Herenstein , executive vice president of Standard &; Poor ' s , referring to the purchase of such large blocks of well-known stocks. // Standard &; Poor ' s licensed the Chicago exchange to use its name in trading futures on the 100-stock average , which was developed in the exchange ' s research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president for research , said today that if the S. &; P. 100 had been manipulated on April 19 , then all the other indexes had , too . " The index is no more manipulable than the overall market , " she said. // Investigators are also looking into the possibility of " front-running , " or whether someone had advance knowledge of large block trades that could lead to wild swings in an index . Passing such tips from the stock exchange to the options exchange is forbidden , but policing such rules is difficult . The exchanges and the S.E.C. are also taking a second look at the trading of subindex options , which are usually based on industry groupings , like technology or telephone companies . Because they generally contain fewer stocks , they theoretically are more subject to manipulation. //
