A rainbow , as every schoolboy knows , is formed by the refraction ( bending ) of sunlight by raindrops . Optical engineers have known for some time that an artificial rainbow can be produced by passing light through certain crystals . An ingenious wartime application of this phenomenon is a rainbow gunsight . <P> The device , known as the " ring sight , " looks something like a reading glass . When a gunner peers through it , he sees a set of rainbow-colored , concentric circles . Unlike rings painted on glass , these optical rings are projected beyond the disk and seem to lie directly on the object sighted ( see cut ) . Easier to use and more accurate than most optical sights , the ring sight is especially helpful against moving targets , because the regularly spaced outer rings give a gunner a means of measuring how much he must lead the target . <P> The rainbow sight is made by sandwiching a natural crystal or a synthetic sodium nitrate crystal between two layers of polarizing glass . Optical engineers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses for it . Camera fans have already found that it makes an excellent view finder.
