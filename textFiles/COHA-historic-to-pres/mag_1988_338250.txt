The other shoe had to drop sooner or later . For five years , atmospheric scientists have known that a 3,000-mile hole in the ozone layer develops over Antarctica during the southern spring . The phenomenon is dramatic evidence of ozone loss in the upper atmosphere , caused largely by man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons , which could leave the earth more vulnerable to cancer-inducing rays from the sun . Now , it seems , there is mounting evidence that the Arctic has its own ozone hole , albeit a smaller one . At the American Geophysical Union meeting last week in Baltimore , W.F.J. Evans , an atmospheric physicist with the Canadian Department of the Environment , announced that an ozone " crater " 1,500 miles wide may be developing over the North Pole . <P> Evans ' findings are based on the release in 1986 of a series of research balloons at Alert , Canada , near the North Pole . Scientific instruments aboard the craft detected a significant loss of ozone between January and March of that year . Unlike the Antarctic ozone hole , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely appeared at all in 1988 . For now , Evans ' colleagues have reserved judgment about his discovery until further studies of the Arctic atmosphere can be made .
