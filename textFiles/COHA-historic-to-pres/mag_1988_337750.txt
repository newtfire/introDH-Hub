 --  December 1986 . New York City . A patient at Montefiore Medical Center could have died when his tracheal breathing tube fell out . Reason : no one on the understaffed night shift heard the respirator alarm go off . <P>  --  February 1987 . Los Angeles . Six days after being released from the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center , a 39-year-old woman dies from complications suffered in a hospital-bed fire . Her family 's contention : harried nurses discovered the accident only after she had suffered burns on 40% of her body . <P>  --  January 1988 . Louisville . For a time , by astonishing coincidence , none of the city 's eleven hospitals can accept critically ill or injured patients . Reason : available beds in intensive-care units can not be filled because not enough nurses are on duty . <P> From New York to Los Angeles , the nation 's hospitals are locked in the grip of what could become the worst nursing shortage since World War II . Overworked and abysmally paid , growing numbers of America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are trading in their bedpans for law books , ledgers and briefcases . The exodus of the exhausted comes at a time when nursing schools are reporting dramatic declines in enrollment and veteran nurses are loudly objecting to their working conditions . Paradoxically , however , there are more nurses employed now than ever before . Thanks to increasingly complex medical technology , an aging patient population and the worsening AIDS epidemic , the demand for nurses has never been greater . <P> Alarmed by gathering signs of a health-care disaster , Secretary of Health and Human Services Otis Bowen recently convened a special commission in Washington to find ways to revitalize the nursing profession . Almost simultaneously , retired Admiral James Watkins , the chairman of the presidential AIDS panel , called for federal programs to attract half a million more nurses by 1991 to treat AIDS patients and others who are chronically ill . Nurses on the job bluntly admit that patients entering U.S. hospitals these days may be risking their lives . " You should be worried if you or someone in your family has to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intensive-care nurse at Einstein-Weiler Hospital in the Bronx . " There is not enough staffing to cover shifts . Patient care is compromised all the time . " <P> In desperation , nurses have taken to the streets to protest . In January , 3,200 nurses staged a 3 1/2 day strike against the Los Angeles County public- hospital system . Hospitals in the New York City area have endured two strikes and four sick-outs in the past eight weeks alone . " You have to be deaf , dumb and blind not to know that there 's a dangerous situation , " says Emergency Room Nurse Renee Gestone , who picketed Brooklyn 's Lutheran Medical Center last week . Adds fellow Striker Pat Stewart : " Some of the doctors are saying that we are morally wrong to go on strike , but is it any more morally wrong than if we are stretched out thin , giving bad care ? "
