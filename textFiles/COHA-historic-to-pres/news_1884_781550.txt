It is impossible to seriously discuss Gen. LoGAN 's letter of acceptance , and we do not feel like ridiculing it . JOHN A. LOGAN , notwithstanding his sympathy and association with the slaveholding Democracy before the war and his coarse defense of the fugitive slave law , was a brave and able soldier . It is that and that alone that has given him his position in public life , but we believe that he has in the main been honest and devoted to the public interest according to his lights . He has none of the equipment of a real statesman , and his letter is a marvel of ignorance and bad reasoning . He goes to the extreme of defending the protective policy , further even than Mr. BLAINE , but it is apparently because he does not understand it , but simply assumes it to be a cardinal doctrine of his party . Any one who understands its theory and is familiar with the arguments by which it is defended by those who have an intelligent belief in it can not fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would make the late HENRY C. CAREY groan . His discussion of questions of currency and commerce shows the same hopeless incapacity . In trying to revive the sectional issue he simply fails to perceive that by no possibility can the evils of which he speaks be directly dealt with by the National Government . The course of Republican Administrations for eight years in regard to them has been.inevitable , and differs in no respect from what would be the Democratic treatment . In regard to civil service reform he has no clearly defined position . Even with all that we knew of Gen. LOGAN 'S capacity for dealing with great public questions , his letter is a disappointment , as it enables unfriendly critics to hold him up to ridicule.
