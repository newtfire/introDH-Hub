New York James C. Hagerty , now a vice-president of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters , Inc. , speaks out of both his experience with broadcasting and his eight years as press secretary to President Eisenhower when he says of the question of renewing the television debates : ? " Those of us in this industry would welcome a TV debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees . We think it would be a good thing for the voters , a real public service . ? " But this must be a question which the candidates themselves decide , based on their own assessment of how best to run their campaigns . ? " Further , looking at it through their eyes , I am not certain whether it is possible for a President to engage in such confrontations on TV . " True Debate ' Urged " I think there is the question , " Mr. Hagerty said in an interview in his ABC office here , " whether an incumbent President , with his knowledge of the security matters of the United States , can engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs  --  when even a ' no comment ' could affect the United States . " Calling the TV confrontations of 1960 " so-called debates , " Mr. Hagerty said they were " just question and answer periods . " If the candidates agree to face each other on television this time , Mr. Hagerty said he would favor two of the four confrontations being " true debates where there is an opening statement , rebuttal , and surrebuttal . " Mr. Hagerty said he would like the debates limited to a few important issues of the day : " Like Cuba and what to do , or Vietnam and what to do , or Berlin and what to do  --  depending on what issues are of major importance at the time . " " This approach , " he said , " would enable the candidates to go into these subjects at great lengths . It would give them an opportunity to explain their basic beliefs . The challenger could make recommendations on what should be done . And the President could support the course he is taking . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different for a Vice-President to be involved in these face-to-face contests on TV than for a President up for election . The impact of a vice-president 's words would in no way be the same as if they came from a man who daily is making the great , global decisions . Neither candidate in the 1960 election had held the office of the President . " Another question , too , " said Mr. Hagerty , " is this : Does the President , particularly in foreign affairs , have a written-in advantage over his opponent ? // Hagerty Muses Over TV Debates // " Let me explain what I mean : " Now the out-of-office presidential nominee does get CIA briefings ( on foreign affairs ) . This was started by Roosevelt with Dewey in 1944 and 1948 . Truman continued this With both Eisenhower and Stevenson in 1952 . And Eisenhower continued this with Stevenson in 1956 and Kennedy in 1960 . " But , on the other hand , " Mr. Hagerty continued . " is a candidate ... even with this knowledge . ? . even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month  --  does it give him convincing knowledge on TV against the man who deals with the subject every single day ? AThus. would he ( the challenging candidate ) care to go on against the President on TV ? knowing that the President has all the answers ? I really do n't know . " As for the incumbent President , Mr. Hagerty conceives a situation in which a president is unable to address himself to a challenge of an opponent simply because of the damage it would do to a course of action the administration is pursuing in the field of global affairs . Situations Compared " I 'm not certain who would have the advantage , " he said . Of the president 's handling of difficult foreign-affairs questions Mr. Hagerty said the difference between the TV con text and a presidential press conference is " obvious . " " In the press conference , the President is just one man there is no opponent . If the President chooses to , he can tell the press that the question is ' too delicate , ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questioner to the Secretary of State . But he ca n't do this in a TV debate . " " I 'm not so sure what a Republican candidate would do this time . He might not go in with a whoop and a holler after what happened in the 1960 debates , " he said . Asked whether the public gets a true image of the candidates through the medium of TV , Mr. Hagerty replied : " You are asking , I judge , whether TV permits a phony or charlatan or idiot to make an impression on the public . The answer is ' nu . ' ' Pitiless Communication'i - " The electric eye of the camera is a most pitiless form of communication  --  and insincerity or unruthfulness or downright slickness comes through forcefully in the living room of people and is spotted as such . I have seen plenty of proof of this through the years . " Another thing , we arc not working in a vacuum . The news media is there , too , to catch any mistakes . " Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV and this is an important quality in the makeup of a leader . . . "
