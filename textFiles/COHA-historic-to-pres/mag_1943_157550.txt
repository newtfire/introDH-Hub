Blue eyes gleaming , Harry Ford Sinclair , 67 , posed for the press photographers in his vast paneled Manhattan office . <P> Lightly held in his big fingers was a check for $1,500,000 that had not yet quite left the hand of Mexico 's Ambassador to the U.S. , Dr. Francisco Castillo Njera ( see cut ) . In the heart which other oilmen think pumps oil instead of blood , was the knowledge that once again Sinclair Oil Corp . had struck a gusher while the rest of the industry struck rock . <P> When Mexico expropriated all U.S. and British oil properties back in 1938 , tough old Harry Sinclair suspected that the old days were gone forever . After an appropriate wait , while the State Department harrumphed and other U.S. oil companies stood on their legal , unenforceable rights , he made his own direct deal with Mexican realists . For $8,500,000 on the barrelhead , plus enough crude to net Sinclair a tidy profit , Mexico could have the whole Sinclair properties with no legalistic strings attached . Last week 's check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Neighbor necessities changed Cordell Hull 's tune on expropriation . By 1941 , the U.S. had to make a face-saving deal to wash out the rest of its oil mess at a payment by Mexico of $24,000,000 plus interest-a metaphysical figure arrived at by a joint two-man commission of experts. * Last week the State Department announced that Mexico , now fat with U.S. dollars , had made final arrangements to settle its debt in full . With the final annual payment in September 1947 , Mexico will own all U.S. oil properties outright for a total of $29,137,700.84 . Chief loser : the die-hard anti-expropriationist Standard Oil Co . ( N.J. ) , whose 75% share in the settlement is an accurate index of its onetime much greater stake in Mexico . <P> While Harry Sinclair has his " soap " ( his favorite word for cash in the bank ) , Standard thus has lost in both pride and purse . Meanwhile , to add insult to injury , it looks as if the British-whose original stake in Mexico ( mainly Shell 's ) was estimated at more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the British Foreign Office still maintains a correct and haughty silence about the principles of expropriation , the oil industry is buzzing with rumors that British oil companies may make a realistic new deal to go in and operate their former properties on a long-term contract . <P> <P> * Independent estimates of the value of U.S. oil properties in Mexico have run to well over $100,000,000 ; one politically-inflated Mexican estimate ( before expropriation ) : $500,000,000.
