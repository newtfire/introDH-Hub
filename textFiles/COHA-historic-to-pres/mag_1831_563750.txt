I PROPOSE to give you a sketch of Cincinnati and its inhabitants . You must take it in my irregular , off-hand manner , for I never do things according to rule . My way is to take ideas as they come , and travel over the paper as fast as possible . Did we judge and speak of cities as we do of persons , I should say Cincinnati was monstrously large of its age . Only forty years ago , the wolves were pro*vling here among the giant trees , and now we boast of thirty thousand souls . We have doubled numbers within seven years , and are at this moment increasiiig faster than ever . In twelve years we shall rival Boston , unless Boston quickens its pace . The fact is , three years make a generation , not in the course of nature , but of unparalleled emigration . Not a twelfth part of our population was born here . We are congregated together from every line of latitude and longitude under the whole heavens . I have seen every sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like Cincinnati , because we are always too much in a hurry to // suit their gravity . It is quite a rarity to see a man sauntering or standing still . We nod hastily when we meet each other , and pass on about our business . I have sought often for a lounging place , where loiterers assemble , but never could find one . You would suppose , to see our bustling , that we had been forewarned that we had not six hours to live , and were yet to begin the settlement of our worldly affairs . Even the drones who are driven out from the human hive of the East become active from sheer imitation . Indolence is grossly unfashionable . Those who have nothing to do , put on the air of business , to avoid being singular . If you ask who among us are lions , I shall be obliged to answer , all or none . We have few trees towering much above the rest . We hold to the doctrine of equality most pertinaciously . The upright man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of influence is on the side of the mechanics . As a body they have been foremost in building up the city , and better citizens could not be desired . But we have lawyers to the number of sixty , and doctors to the number of seventy , and clergymen , alas ! I know not how many . But I defy you to mention a sect which has not a name here . The most noisy are the Ranting Methodists . YOU might easily mistake their worship for the yells of bedlam One might suppose they believed that nothing less loud than screams can be heard so far as heaven . The preacher finds great relief in the general uproar , for his voice is completely drowned , and no matter what he says , so that he seems to shout . By the way , loud speaking is very much in vogue here . I have observed that the lawyers in court usually speak at the very top of their voice , and this seems to give great satisfaction to clients . The laying out of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Philadelphia , too , we are supplied with water from a reservoir above the city , for which we have the satisfaction of paying well . But , unlike Philadelphia , and every other Christian city , our streets are not lighted in the night . Every citizen , who ventures abroad , when the moon is absent , carries his own lantern , or runs the risk of breaking his neck . It is a curious sight in a dark evening , to see the lights hurrying in all directions , passing , repassing , and flitting to and fro , as if dancing at a masquerade of genii . But this precaution is absolutely necessary to the lovers of sound limbs , for there is not a square in the city , where new buildings are not going up , and obstructing the sidewalks with lumber . Why the city government have not thought fit to light the streets , I can not say . The reason said to be assigned by an ebony gentleman , is , that thieves would be able to see their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispositions of the place , I can hardly speak in terms strong enough to suit me . To say that the citizens are hospitable and warm-hearted , would be too little . The Philadelphians are all this , if you can but get at them . But then they are so prim and precise , so intrenched behind forms , so hemmed round and round by etiquette , that your gray hairs begin to appear , before you can become intimate . Not so here . Every thing is free and easy . You are received at once with a cordial welcome , and placed , if you deserve it , on a familiar , social footing . It is no offence to call a half an hour before twelve in the morning , or to appear with a black // stock or boots , at a party in the evening . Each individual is held to be the best judge of what is proper for his costume ; and this is no small matter . What other city can you name , in which the rights of private judgement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching parties , there is one custom , which , though growing out of gallantry , is sadly to be deprecated . The gentlemen must never eat or drink , till all the ladies in all the rooms have been helped . The result is , that if you are talking with a lady , when the waiter comes round , after helping her you must play the mute , while she is eating ,  --  for , maugre the horror of Lord Byron , the ladies will eat  --  and then , when your turn comes to eat , she must stand mute . All which is very awkward , especially as eating and drinking ,  --  so great is the profusion of good things ,  --  form the chief occupation of the evening . The other amusements are dancing , for the most part by the piano ; recitations , where gentlemen can be found sufficiently courageous ; and lastly , music , but of this there is very little . Did I possess one tithe of Scott 's talent for description , I would give you such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make you envy my eyes their perpetual feast . Verily , nature performed her chef d'o ? uvre , when she scooped out this amphitheatre , and embosomed it within this circuit of hills . There they rise , covered with the most luxuriant verdure and foliage ; and there they will ever stand as faithful sentinels , to guard us from the blast in all directions . One might almost imagine the Ohio herself , felt the beauty of the paradise through which she flows ; for she curves majestically round the spot , as if reluctant to resume her march to the gulf . Imagine the fair village of Northampton in Massachusetts , grown up into a populous city , and placed directly on the banks of the Connecticut , and you will have a better idea of the situation of Cincinnati , than I can give you by mere words . But then you must remember that our celestial canopy wears a much deeper blue , and surrounding vegetation is incomparably more vigorous , than your climate can furnish . It is almost worth a journey over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees in this neighborhood . Even the grape vines , that clasp and interlace them , are of the size of a dozen cables . Every thing , in short , deepens the impression that nature wrought here upon a magnificent scale . I alluded in the beginning to our unparalleled increase . Let me return to it again , for it is nothing short of marvelous . On any common calculation of chances , ten , twenty , or thirty years ago , nothing like our condition at this moment could have been predicted . Probabilities were altogether against it . History and experience could furnish no data for such vaticination . Had the enterprising founder , John Cleves Symmes , in 1800 , eleven years after he selected this for the site of a town , ventured , in the fervor of his zeal , to prophecy that , in 1831 , a population half as large as Boston , would here find all the substantial comforts and accommodations , together with most of the elegancies and luxuries of a complete and finished city , he would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have passed for the raving of an over-heated imagination . Nevertheless here the city stands , or rather moves , all of that and soon to be more . I say this is a marvel in political economy . And remember // it has passed through hard struggles . Perhaps no city ever witnessed a heavier depression than this has within ten years . It was the principal depot for our north-western forces during the last war . This gave it an unnatural start . With peace came reverses . It bore up for a time and then fell . Its very life-blood seemed to stagnate . Dearth of capital and destruction of credit pressed like an incubus upon it , and paralysed all its nerves and sinews . But , like the fabled Anheus , it has sprung up the more vigorous from its fall . Not a trace of that depression now remains . Credit is as good as in any city in the Union . Capital to be sure is not so plenty , if we may judge from the high interest it commands , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital than in most other places ; and even the comparative dearth is more apparent than real . It is the effect of the multiplied channels of profitable investment , through which it is drained off as fast as it can accumulate . The question is often asked whether this is not a forced , hot-bed growth , unsound because unnatural ? I have already intimated my opinion . So far as the character and pursuits of the population can furnish a guaranty for future progress , that of Cincinnati seems to be insured . I speak not now of literary taste or polished manners , the effect of which is to embellish a city ; but of those strong , vigorous traits of character , which are calculated to enlarge a city ; and I have no hesitation in saying , that , for native resolution , sound practical sense , clear perceptions of expediency , prevailing frugality , and untiring activity , I know not where to look for a superior . There are good a priori reasons for this opinion , as well as the evidence of observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrants are enterprising men . Indolent , sluggish , shiftless people stay at home . It requires force of character to sunder all local ties and take up one 's march for a distant abode . The very determination and decision , involved in the act of emigration , are good omens of future thrift . If emigrants can consent to leave all else , this proves that they bring an unconquerable will . And then comes in the maxim-possunt quia posse videntur-they can prevail , because they think they can . They are soldiers of fortune , who have thrown away the scabbard , and trusted all to their address and intrepidity , the strong arm and unflinching nerve . Tell me that a city is peopled by emigrants , whether from other nations or other states , and I will venture to say , without having seen them , that they are true and trusty men . They may want the polished graces of life ; they may have rough points , and so rub hard against each other ; they may bring with them prejudices and predilections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one thing they will be sure to bring , and that is hardy enterprise , the mainspring and best pledge of success . This is what the Cincinnatians , as a body , possess in a pre-eminent degree . A word now on the subject of equality , at which I before hinted . I doubt if there be another state in the twenty-four , where the whole fabric and appendages of society are so thoroughly republican , as in Ohio . We became a state in 1802 , just when the tenets of Jefferson were in full tide . Hence our constitution was made decidedly radical , and not a feature has been changed . All our officers , from a constable to a chief justice , are elected and not appointed ; and every man // of competent age , without regard to property , has a right to vote . Here , then , practically no less than theoretically , all power is in the hands of the people , and never did miser guard his treasure with greater vigilance . Wealth exerts a comparatively trifling influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overgrown fortunes . The richest among us began with nothing . Of course we hear little of affluent connexions and family alliances . To use a homely but significant phrase , every man stands upon his own bottom . " Unpropped by ancestry , the force of his own merit makes his way . " In the professions , diplomas and titles are treated with a most unreverential levity . The question is not , where or how a man was educated , but what he is . The emigrant , young or old , is put upon his probation . If he proves himself worthy of employment , he will have it . If not , no parchment , or certificate , or letter of commendation , can hold him up . Many of our citizens have no relative this side of the AtJantic ; still more have none this side of the mountains . Standing thus alone and unallied , our motto in action is , " each for himself , and heaven for us all . " Necessity teaches us to be self-confident and self-dependent ; and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degenerates into modest assurance . This keeps the individual from being merged in the mass , and furnishes ample occasion for developing the strongest traits of character . I have thus attempted to give you an idea of the Queen of western cities , and of the busy multitude who have here selected their home . I have said nothing of our literary institutions , because they are yet in embryo or in infancy . I have not praised our public works and build*ings , because we have none that entitle us to distinction . Acting on the principle that charity begins at home , our citizens have attended to their own private affairs first . But every thing now promises that long before we shall have numbered half the years of the eastern cities , we shall be able to boast of as praiseworthy monuments of pub lic spirit .
