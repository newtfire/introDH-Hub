THE CAT-Colette-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $1.50 ) . <P> To a number of other distinctions Sidonie Gabrielle Claudine Colette can add that of being one of the most rapidly-translated novelists in literature . In the past seven years 15 of her French novels have been published in the U. S. , and at one period in 1931-32 translations of them appeared almost every other month . That the reserve of untranslated Colette novels was rapidly being exhausted , many an enthusiast realized with regret last week when the latest item in this Frenchwoman 's list appeared . <P> The Cat tells the story of Saha , a golden-eyed , jealous , aristocratic little animal that broke up a marriage , sapped the strength of young Alain Amparat until he came to care more for her than for his handsome wife . That Colette can make such a tale readable will be no surprise to her admirers . That she can manage to include in it many artful descriptions of amorous misadventures and much erotic play , they will take for granted . But if they expect her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her fiction than she will give them . <P> Alain was blond , handsome , a little priggish , a pampered only son . He bought Saha at a cat show , raised her for three years , delighted in her quiet , affectionate tricks . He had a few misgivings when he married Camille , who was modern , athletic , informed , impulsive , changeable as a mountain stream . But he lost them during their honeymoon and only began to harbor a secret resentment at Camille 's plans for remaking their house . While it was being done over they lived on the ninth floor of a Paris apartment , to which Alain soon found an excuse for bringing his pet . As the young couple began to quarrel , after the first ardor of their passion died , Camille grew to hate the cat , at last pushed it off the railing . Then she felt at peace , dressed herself fetchingly , waited for her husband 's return .

The life of Sidonie Gabrielle Claudine Colette reads like a scenario for one of her novels . She was born 63 years ago in Burgundy , the daughter of a Captain in the Zouaves who was an unsuccessful politician and a student of military affairs . A star pupil in school , she read constantly , wrote compositions " as easily as one would fry an egg , " did not realize the character of her talent until later . At 20 she married a 34-year-old author of popular romances who had hoped she would help him socially , found that she was too outspoken to be a social success . Soon he published a book called Claudine at School which made both a scandal and a success , and although he admitted that he had not written all of it , witnesses who saw the manuscript afterwards testified that he had written almost none , that it was his wife 's work . For six years thereafter the collaboration persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .
