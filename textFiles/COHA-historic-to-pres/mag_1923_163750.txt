Rupert of Hentzau . With the stock of good stories available for the screen rapidly dwindling , one has a frantic desire to call out the National Guard , the Shriners and the Girl Scouts for a solemn processional of thanksgiving when a good novel is cinematized in the manner of living to which its characters are accustomed . Nay , furthermore , these characters themselves are personages ; the list : Elaine Hammerstein , Marjorie Daw , Lew Cody , Bert Lytell , Bryant Washburn . <P> For those who do not know the story from Anthony Hope 's novel , it need only be said that it is laid in the Court of Ruritania ( a European Kingdom ) . There are quantities of scarlet uniforms , marching and countermarching , and love making with a real Queen . An English youth , in appearance the King 's twin , impersonates the Royal gentleman arid becomes involved in a love affair with the wife ( Queen Flavia ) . <P> Miss Daw , in a small part , manages to hurry away with most of Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lytell , who plays the Britisher and the King too , swagger most effectively . <P> When the producers were digging for a subtitle writer they inadvertently struck a gusher . Otherwise the production is excellent . <P> Success . There is a great deal of drinking throughout . In fact the King Lear of a big Broadway production gets drunk just before the opening night . This sorry deed has well nigh wrecked the show when who should thrust himself into the gap but Brandon Tynan . Mr. Tynan plays an aged actor with white hair and a pink lizard complex , who once had success but drank away his reputation . He gets into the Royal Whiskers , and plays Lear looking like a cross between David Belasco and Santa Claus . Despite the fact that the picture is " full of laughter and tears " and that the story is convincing , it all seems very unfair to Shakespeare . <P> Children of Jazz . With Divorce and Wandering Daughters , this effort completes a trilogy of the three worst pictures ever produced . It is another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
