It was a curse that only occultists and the Kansas City Royals could understand , and it had stuck there on their foreheads after the playoffs of 1976 , 1977 and 1978 . But George Brett , the best player in the game , took the curse and stuck it under a seat in the second row of the third deck . For it was Brett , in one of those superpower confrontations with Rich Gossage that will still be the stuff of nostalgia in the year 2025 , who launched an awesome , towering and historic three-run homer off Gossage in the seventh inning last night that beat the Yankees , 4-2 , ended the curse , completed a three-game playoff sweep and brought Kansas City its first American League pennant . One step from the offseason , Phineas T. Bluster , alias George Steinbrenner , tried to pull anything he could . He met with Dick Howser and his coaches ( yes , Mike Ferraro ' s fingers are still there ) . He helped organize a chapel service ( " George is trying to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . And he brought out Thurman Munson ' s kid to throw out the first ball . However , he didn ' t have enough divine guidance to keep the rains away . While Tommy John and Paul Splittorff were hooked up in a dual shutout in the fourth , umpire chief Bill Haller stopped the game . The rain delay lasted 32 minutes , and when John got around to pitching , Willie Mays Aikens ripped his first pitch off the glove of the leaping Bob Watson for a single . Darrell Porter just missed a double down the right-field line , and Howser had Tom Underwood and Ron Davis warming up when John went to 3-and-2 on the Royal catcher . But Porter flied to Lou Piniella to end the inning . It was the second baseman no one knows , Frank White , who broke the scoreless tie . White , who battled from 0-and-2 to get a hit preceding Willie Wilson ' s triple in Game 2 and was 5 for 7 in the first two games , lined a home run down the left-field line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When White had to leap to make a superb stab of Watson ' s liner leading off the bottom of the sixth and Jackson went out and lined a double over Brett ' s head , Royal manager Jim Frey brought in his ace , Dan Quisenberry . It was an unusal move , it being only the sixth inning . It also did not work . Oscar Gamble batted for Eric Soderholm and hit a sharp grounder up the middle . White made a fabulous stab , but tried throwing to third , hoping to catch Jackson rounding the bag . But his off- balance throw sailed over Brett ' s head and caromed off the auxiliary boxes at the end of the Royal dugout . As Brett tried to pick it up and keep from falling down the steps , he accidentally knocked the ball into the dugout , which , when everyone stopped moving in counterclockwise circles , put Gamble at third . Cerone lined a single into left-center , the Yankees had a 2-1 lead , and Gossage , who hadn ' t even gotten into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullpen in the seventh . As the seventh inning progressed , Frey was having his batboy grab balls and stuffing them in his coat pocket - five of them - as he screamed at umpire Larry McCory about John cutting up the balls . Nothing came of his protestsbecause when Wilson doubled into the right-field corner with two out , Howser brought in Gossage . And the best player in baseball crushed the best reliever . Washington was the first batter Gossage faced , and when he chopped a bouncer over the mound , he simply outran Randolph ' s throw . First and third . Next pitch:Brett ' s towering shot landed in the second row of the third deck , the sixth home run he ' s hit in four playoffs , which ties Steve Garvey ' s record . 4-2 Royals . Then came the unbelievable eighth . Watson began it with a triple to left- center . Quisenberry got Jackson 0-and-2 . Nine straight balls later , Jackson was on second , Gamble on first , and Quisenberry was 1-and-0 on Cerone . The submarining reliever finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive - that Washington grabbed stretching toward the hole , looked around and found that Jackson had pulled a monumental blunder . He was caught off second . Double play . Jim Spencer batted for Piniella , grounded to White , and the funny little pitcher who sounds like a Baskin-Robbins flavor had somehow survived .
