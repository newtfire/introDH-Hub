The case that continues to haunt John Connally-despite his acquittal-was a complex web of accusations . Watergate prosecutors investigating President Nixon 's campaign finances began to concentrate in October of 1973 on donations by dairymen . By August of 1974 , the Government had amassed enough evidence to win a Washington grand jury indictment charging Connally on five counts for having allegedly accepted $10,000 from Associated Milk Producers , Inc. , the nation 's largest dairy cooperative . <P> Most of the Government 's case rested on information provided by Jake Jacobsen , a Texas lawyer who was once an aide in the Johnson White House and who had long been Connally 's friend . Jacobsen faced numerous charges of fraud and perjury . In plea bargaining , these charges were dropped ; but he pleaded guilty to a single count of bribery and agreed to testify against Connally . He maintained that during a talk in Connally 's office at the Treasury Department on April 28 , 1971 , Connally asked for money for himself in return for his help in persuading President Nixon to increase milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milk Producers , said Jacobsen , who was an attorney for the coop , it gave him $10,000 , which he delivered to Connally in two $5,000 installments later that year . But Connally got nervous , according to Jacobsen , when a Watergate grand jury began looking into the dairymen 's contributions . Jacobsen said that he and Connally met in an Austin hotel and concocted a cover story . If they were ever questioned about the money , said Jacobsen , they would both maintain that while it had been offered to Connally , he had refused it and Jacobsen had put it in a bank safe-deposit box . To back up this alibi , according to Jacobsen , Connally then handed over a cigar box containing $ 10,000 , which was soon stashed in an Austin bank . <P> Lending some credence to Jacobsen 's account were travel and telephone records confirming the dates on which he said he had seen or called Connally . And when the FBI opened the safe-deposit box , it found that some of the bills inside probably had been put into circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been locked up according to the cover story . <P> The case against Connally , however , depended on Jacobsen 's word . Defense Attorney Edward Bennett Williams , hired by Connally for a reported $250,000 fee , hammered away at Jacobsen 's testimony . In a number of instances , he forced the central prosecution witness to back down and acknowledge that he was unsure of some details . Williams also emphasized that Jacobsen , on other occasions , had admitted perjury . Cumulatively , this eroded Jacobsen 's credibility and enhanced Connally 's . Perhaps no less important was the parade of celebrated witnesses who testified to Connally 's integrity . They included : the Rev. Billy Graham , Lady Bird Johnson and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk . <P> - BLACK STAR Among the most important was Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan , who said she delayed agreeing to speak up for Connally for a week , partly because she felt she was " being used ... because Washington is an overwhelmingly black town " but finally testified on his behalf for the sake of fairness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
