When Willard Wirtz was named to replace Arthur Goldberg as Labor Secretary two years ago , A.F.L.-C.I.O . President George Meany was happy-but not for long . As the months passed , Wirtz irked Meany more and more-largely because the Secretary was not a flat-out champion of labor . When Wirtz failed to come out in a full-throated protest against compulsory arbitration in transportation industries during his testimony at congressional hearings , Meany scornfully described him to a friend : " This guy is not a standup guy . He bends . " <P> That festered in Meany 's mind for a long time . Three weeks ago at a White House meeting with Lyndon Johnson , Meany was stunned to learn that Wirtz wanted to get rid of Meany 's favorite man in the Labor Department-Under Secretary John Henning , 49 , who had been a California Federation of Labor staffer for a decade , then had served as Democratic Governor Pat Brown 's state director of industrial relations before being called to Washington in 1962 . <P> After watching Henning operate for many months , Wirtz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone more compatible . But George Meany considered John Henning a perfect union representative in Government . As soon as he heard of Wirtz 's plan to oust Henning , foxy old George arranged dozens of phone calls to top U.S. unionists to tell them of Henning 's plight . He also saw to it that the story was leaked to the press . Suddenly , thousands of union men 's protest telegrams began to bombard the White House-some even came from ships at sea . Quite a few irritably demanded that Wirtz himself be fired . <P> That kind of pressure from the labor movement , which had delivered several million loyal votes for Lyndon Johnson , had a salutary effect . Arthur Goldberg himself entered the controversy , set up a meeting of Wirtz , Meany and himself . There , Justice Goldberg judiciously suggested that Wirtz rescind his demand that Henning leave . That may change in the future , but for the moment George Meany had chalked up a singular and unusual victory-an outside veto over who goes and who stays in a Government department .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
