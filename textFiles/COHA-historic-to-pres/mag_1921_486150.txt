T ODAY I was to go to the Baroness von W. but got a ' phone to say she was in bed with cold ; and just then a ' phone came from Blticherl at the Esplanade Hotel  --  to my great joy  --  and I hurried off to lunch with him there . After lunch I talked with the Countess . She is in great distress for her young brother , left with two broken legs in a captured trench . . . . Countess Bliicher3 hopes sincerely I may succeed in raising a real good rebellion in Ireland , and so bring peace by terrifying the British Government . 26 ( ? ) November Count von Wedel rang me up to say the two priests4 had arrived from Rome and had been with him at the Foreign Office . They are in charge of a Dominican father , who will get them rooms in some quiet hotel , and then I am to see them . Von Wedel says they knew " who I was " but did not know me personally . No , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mine before we part . 27 November Meyer came at 12 and said the two Irish priests ( from Rome ) were out " for a walk " and could not be found  --  so I ca n't go till tomorrow . He tells me that in their interview with von Wedel yesterday they showed that they had been given strict instructions to abstain from all politics ! Good , if they keep to that . 28 November Meyer came at my request at 11 and read over the letter I propose sending to Ireland by the channel Princess Pless tells Countess Blucher of . He agreed to its wording and I gave it him to get typed at Foreign Office . Then to Bliicher and the Countess till nearly 2 p.m . I refused to see the Princess  --  yet . She is anxious to meet me ; says she is Irish ! ( I believe her mother was Irish ; but the Cornwallis-West family are just what we know ? English of the English . ) The Countess B. is fine . She really would like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Germany . A message to go and see Father O'Gorman and Crothy at 4. 30 November I went to the holy men at 4:30 and found Father O'Gorman a loyalist nationalist  --  and Father Crothy , the Dominican , thank God , a raging Fenian ! Both promised me not to be " agents of the British Government " ? as I asked them  --  but to confine themselves strictly to their holy business . They are to be entirely " non-political . " The question is will they ? . . . On Sunday Bliicher called . He says he heard from von 1 Copyright , 1921 , by Charles E. Curry . All rights reserved .

Stapleton-Bretherton of Rainbill Hall , Lancashire , England . 3 Letter from Evelyn , Countess Blucher , found among Sir Roger 's papers : Hotel Esplanade Berlin W. Berlin-Hamburg Bellevuestrasso Dear Sir Roger , I am so glad Fr . Crothy is coming ; I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him come and see me without fail . I want to see him very badly indeed about my own affairs , and I will be most discreet about yours . I should like to see you again before you leave , but I do not know whether it would be wise for me to do so We are all watched in these days . You have so much of my sympathy and I will pray for you . - Yrs sincerely , E. B. 4 Fathers O'Gorman and Crothy sent to care for the spiritual needs of British soldiers of Catholic faith in captivity in Germany . Jagow to whom he had written asking him to lunch to meet me . Jagow replied that he was off with the Emperor on Saturday night and could not come , and added things about Ireland and my mission that by Bliicher 's showing were not very favorable . But Bliicher is extraordinarily inaccurate in his versions of happenings . It is " untruth by defect . " He does not intend to misstate but he does . . . . 1 December To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eoin MacNeill  --  inclosed in one to , and this in one to Wambersin and Son , Rotterdam ; this , finally , to go to Herr Bailin in Hamburg , who can get it through to England , unopened , so Bliicher says . This is the route Princess of Pless takes and it is on her advice . Bliicher says that the leading Germans still are not keen for ward outrance with England  --  at least the diplomatic world of Germany of which von Jagow is the type . They wanted  --  and want ? English " friendship . " The military machine , however ( and happily ) , is under no such illusions and desires mightily to get at England ; and as Bliicher says , the military mind in Germany dominates the civil power in every way and also has absorbed far the ablest minds of the land , so that German intelligence is much better represented in Army and Navy circles than in the Foreign Office and governing administration . This is evident ! If the men who have controlled German diplomacy and brought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world had had the war machine to run , I guess the French and Russian armies would now be near Potsdam . ? 2 December The letter from Adler of 26 November that Meyer brought me on Monday said that he had " got Findlay sure " ? and begged me to write a " fake " letter . This I did on 1 December  --  an absurd epistle about chartering a boat for $30,000 and hiring two men , and a lot more that Adler suggested . He says that his plan to catch Findlay is a fine one . Findlay gave him kroner 500 this time ; that is 625 he has got from the Rascal . Put the kroner at one shilling , it gives over ? 30 the British Government have disbursed on that branch of their secret service  --  and I wish them joy of the value received ! The " moral and material " gains are , I fear , on the wrong side of the account . Sir Roger 's personal reply to Adler 's letter of 26 November reads : 2 December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November yesterday afternoon  --  and now send you the inclosed for your friend . He can keep it if he likes ! I hope , however , if you let him keep it ( as " proof " against me ) you will succeed at same time in getting some proof of the deal . I hate what I am doing all the time and feel almost as big a cur as he is , and were it for my own sake or interest alone I should never have put pen to paper in the matter  --  except to tell him to his face what a ruffian I think him . However , I am grateful indeed to you for all your faithful efforts in my behalf and I hope your plan will be successful and that this fake letter I inclose will help it on . I may not be in Berlin when you get here , but you will be able to learn where I am from the address you know of . I shall not be at the Continental Hotel after today , and you must not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive , you will be able to get a room in some small hotel till I return ; and they will give you my address and send on any telegram from you and , as soon as I hear from you , I would come here , supposing I am away when you arrive . Please be very careful in all you do  --  and . make sure you do n't do wrong while trying to prove your friend 's guilt . I hope you consulted the lawyer as I told you to do  --  and the schoolmaster . For your own sake , too , I want you to be careful , because you are dealing with very powerful people , and I am not a match for them in any way ; and if you make any serious mistake they will drop on you , and I could not protect you . So , please , be careful , for your own sake no less than for mine . I do not want you to get into trouble for me or to do anything wrong ( beyond the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want you to become an honest good man , dear Adler , and to help you to this ; and so I am really unhappy when I think of you telling lies for me ; and were it not for the reasons you know so well I should not consent . I hope you have been happy with your father and mother and young brother and sisters during your stay in Moss . Do n't use any of your friend 's 500 kronen ! If you want money , let me know . I will send all you may need ; but as you do n't ask for any I presume you have enough . Do n't carry any papers back on your person ; send all letters , etc. , etc. , you may want to show me through the channel in Christiania . Also post me the last English papers the same as the others . I was gla 'd to get them . Your friendly master , ( sgd ) R. I was very glad to hear from you ; but I am always sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight him  --  not to i against him and tell lies . Come back here quickly , and , . if I am not here wait quietly  --  and if you need money , in my absence , I will see that it is given you . You should ask for the Count . If I learn that neither Bethmann-Hollweg nor von Jagow can see me , and I care not what the reason assigned may be , I shall decline to continue our " conversations " and shall ask for a passport to enable me to go to Norway or Sweden . These thoughts hardened during the night . I am not at all pleased with their attitude toward Christiania , and from Blucher 's ? ( and Schiemann 's ) remarks it is clear they do not accept my view of the Findlay affair . I told Meyer so , and he got very red and shuffled , but from von Wedel 's remarks about Adler , when I left the letters to be forwarded , it is clear they want me to drop the Christiania affair altogether  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do neither . I shall go on with the case against Findlay by every means in my power and I shall do all I can to help poor Adler to live a better life . From the point of view of the Irish cause I am not sure that the case against Findlay is not more telling than would be even the formation of an Irish brigade . Of course , for the Germans , the Irish brigade is most important . It shames John Bull 's - army and it knocks recruiting on the head in Ireland . The Findlay business has no interest for them ; and they do not appreciate its significance rightly  --  or the vast effect . it would have on public opinion in Ireland and U. S. A. But even if they did , it would be for me only  --  and not for them ; and they are keen only on the things I can do that will help them . Quite naturally . But equally quite naturally , I mean to convict John Bull 's Government of being what I have always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christiania affair I am more and more determined to go on with it , just as I perceive the reluctance of the German authorities to my proceeding increases . I owe it to myself now . After Schiemann 's disgraceful reference to Adler , and von Jagow 's letter to Bliicher that the latter told me held doubts as to the authenticity of the interview between Findlay and Adler , I should be admitting the justice of these views were I now to withdraw . Besides there are the letters I wrote to ? and sent by Adler , which were handed by him to Findlay . Those letters have long since been handed to the Foreign Office and constitute for- Downing Street overwhelming proof of my guilt . To retire now from the affair , merely because Wilhelmstrasse does not like it , would be to make the British Government a present of my character indeed and enable them to poison the ears of everyone in Ireland and U. S. A. against me and to prove their charges from my own writings . No , I must launch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field with the accusation , and part of the accusation itself must consist of those very letters on which they are now relying to base their charges of horrible treason against me . And no time should be lost either . Frankfurt-on-Main , 3 December I got here this morning at 7:10 in darkness . My train left the Anhalt Station at Berlin at 10:20 last night . There has been little . to record the last few days . Monday I was unwell and stayed in my room all day . Professor Schiemann called late at night with disquieting statements about Adler that were unwarranted and malicious.6 Poor Adler ! God knows he is bad enough without these professional inquests on him . I was annoyed beyond words  --  and disgusted . Things look very black for Serbia and there will be little pity for her fate . Her case is different from that of Belgium , although the publication of the " Anglo-Belgian Military Conventions " of 1906 entirely upsets the Belgian pose of neutrality . She was no more neutral than France ? or England . She deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1912 dared to inform Belgium that she , England , would land troops in Belgium " to defend Belgian neutrality , " whether Belgium consented or not ! This is the masterpiece of the correspondence  --  and the height of neutrality for you . I lunched yesterday at the Astoria Hotel with Baron and Baroness von Roeder . He- is Court Chamberlain-Master of the Ceremonies . She was a daughter of Lord Rockingham . Of course her English was perfect ; but her heart is now entirely German and she shared all my views and hopes . Countess Blucher also there . She , poor lady , very unhappy and trying to be German  --  but her heart still with her own land . I told Blitcher of Schiemann 's remarks about Adler , and then of the truth  --  of Adler 's confession to me the night before he left . Bliicher agrees with me about him , that there is an innate chivalry and sense of honor and courage that make amends . I went to von Wedel at 7 to tell him  --  as I felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Esplanade and came on to the Anhalt Station at 10 . Bliicher is very keen on the Christiania business and says he had a long talk with von Roeder  --  today after I had lunched there  --  who will also take it up . Bliicher had no right to discuss the matter , however , with anyone . I told him to keep it quiet ; and he has gossiped all through Berlin about it  --  written about it to von Jagow , the Secretary of State , and now wants to syndicate it and run it as a sort of private concern . Blilcher proposes getting Herr Bailin qwq interested and employing a special detective to go with Adler to Norway and get the convincing proofs of Findlay 's guilt . I agree with reservation . I have for general use an Imperial Passport No. 2192 , issued by the Emperor 's " special order " and signed for the Imperial Chancellor by one Dargitz , issued for three months from 2 December , 1914 . The passport is for " traveling in Germany , " and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I showed it here at the hotel on registering , and wrote my name , birthplace , year , and date of birth . And so now , thirty-four days after I reached Berlin , I become myself . It is strange no word comes from von Bernstorff . Indeed , so far as I can observe it , " German diplomacy " deserves many of the hard things Billy Tyrrell said of it in the Foreign Office in November , 1912 , at our historic meeting . But the real German diplomats are not in the Foreign Office , but in the German armies and navy . The brains of thecountry and its best character are of necessity there and the civil power is left to fish for inferior intelligences with less attractive bait . 6 December De G. advised me to see either Bethmann-Hollweg or von Jagow quickly and not to be content with von Wedel . He said that von Wedel was merely a " letter carrier " and I should insist on the heads of the Government seeing me . I wrote to von Wedel a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special post at 7:40 a.m. on the Monday morning . I have decided , perhaps finally , on one thing . It is that I shall insist on seeing either von Jagow or the Chancellor . Both are in Berlin . If I can not get an interview with them I shall take it as a proof that the German Government is not sufficiently in earnest for me to go on further . To be continued.
