A Polish woman came to Ellis Island , N.Y. , three years ago and was found to be admissible except on one point : she could not read nor write . Her case was taken into court ; she was released on bond ; went to Brooklyn ; studied . Last week , the courts decided against her ; she was ordered deported . That she can now read makes no difference . She is Mrs. Jacob Bushbaum of Brooklyn .
