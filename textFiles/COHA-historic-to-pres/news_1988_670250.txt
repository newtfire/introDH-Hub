Let ' s face facts . Retirement costs are escalating . For example , federal spending on Social Security is estimated to be more than $200 billion , or one-fifth of the federal budget in fiscal 1989 . These costs continue to grow as more retirees are added to the rolls , retirees live longer and automatic cost-of-living adjustments are made . Another fact : The Social Security trustfund surplus is illusory . Until 1983 , when Congress enacted Social Security reform legislation to shore up the shaky status of the funds , Social Security was a pay-as-you-go proposition , financed by current workers for current retirees . At that time , Congress provided for an increase in the payroll tax designed in part to build a surplus sufficient to keep the system viable as the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age . In the meantime , that surplus must be invested in government bonds and T-bills and currently offsets part of the federal budget deficit . At some point , these funds must be repaid to the Social Security account . But that can not happen unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as we continue to run a federal deficit in the neighborhood of $150 billion a year , the future viability of Social Security is also in jeopardy . A third fact : the baby boomers are not preparing for retirement . According to a report of the Joint Economic Committee , more baby boomers fall in the category of " downwardly mobile "  --  economically dependent on two incomes  --  than fit the stereotypical " yuppie " image . In 1984 , 47% of Americans aged 25-34 earned less than $13 , 000 a year ; 70% earned less than $20 , 000 . Fewer than half of young families owned their own homes , and the median income for those two-income families totaled $25 , 157  --  hardly enough to buy a BMW and certainly not enough to save much toward retirement . Fact four : Baby boomers and their children will pay more for their own retirement and get less in return . The Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress and the Social Security Administration ' s own " intermediate-range " projections point to the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taxes and receive less in benefits than the current elderly . Those who were age 65 in 1984 will , on the average , collect Social Security benefits worth more than 2 1/2 times the value of their contributions . Their 21-year-old counterparts in 1984 can expect to receive less than 98 cents on the dollar for their contributions . Finally : It ' s not too late to correct our course . The oldest baby boomers still have 23 years left in the work force . If we make certain policy changes before these workers retire , there will be plenty of time for this generation to plan ahead . What exactly do I propose ? First , we obviously need to bring the federal budget into balance as soon as possible , so that we can afford to repay the Social Security funds currently invested in T-bills and government bonds . The choices we need to make to eliminate the deficit would require more space than this column allows . But the next president should follow closely the recommendations of the bipartisan economic commission . Its report due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive deficit-reduction plan , just as a similar commission ( the Greenspan Commission ) helped Congress enact Social Security reform in 1983 . Second , we need to reverse the trend toward early retirement , where fully two-thirds of individuals retire before age 65 . Policies that were put in place to encourage retirement and allow room in the job market for the baby boomers can be rescinded . According to a report by the Senate Aging Committee , three-fourths of the labor force would prefer to continue some type of part-time work after retirement . Congress has already moved in the right direction by increasing the retirement credit for those who work beyond age 65 , eliminating mandatory retirement at age 70 for private pensions and liberalizing the Social Security earnings test . Current law provides that the Social Security retirement age be gradually raised to age 67 by the year 2027 . Instead , because of health and longevity gains , we should consider raising retirement to age 70 , over the same period . Third , we need to return to the original premise of Social Security as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encourage private savings . For example , we might consider a reinstatement of full-deductibility for IRAs , or more generous tax treatment for capital gains on long-term investments . A final point . Right now all retirees get an annual inflation adjustment ( COLA ) in their Social Security benefit whether they need it or not , and those with bigger benefits get bigger increases . That ' s not fair to low-income retirees and is not an affordable policy in the long run . While it would be the least popular of all the options I have proposed , we might consider instituting some type of cap on Social Security cost-of-living adjustments , such as a flat dollar-amount COLA , or further means-testing benefits by making all Social Security income taxable or limiting COLAs on the basis of income . These or other changes could help keep a basic Social Security system solvent for future retirees without jeopardizing benefits of current retirees . Whatever our choices , the viability of the Social Security system for the baby-boom generation and future generations is at stake . We can put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the system will be there for them ; that some changes are in store to keep the system solvent ; and that their retirement plans should be made accordingly . Policy makers must face the facts . And we owe it to our kids and ourselves to face them now.  --  - Rep. Penny , ( D. Minn. ) is co-chairman of Americans for Generational Equity.
