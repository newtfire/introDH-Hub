In the 1950s , there was very little information about the furniture made by our neighbors to the north . The notable New York City dealer C. W. Lyon clearly appreciated the so-called salamander armchairs he advertised in The Magazine ANTIQUES in 1955 ( Fig 5 ) , although he mistakenly attributed them to New England . However , it was published images such as these that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the founder of the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne , Vermont . With a strong aesthetic sense , Webb was drawn to furniture with striking shapes and painted surfaces , which she avidly collected between about 1940 and 1960 , assuming that much of it was made in the United States . Since her death , additional research has been conducted by Canadian scholars and published in magazines and monographs.1 Based on this new information , some pieces in the Shelburne Museum attributed to New England are now seen as having a Quebec origin.2 The resulting group of twenty-five pieces is the largest collection of French-Canadian furniture in a museum in the United States . An exhibition entitled Quebec Country Furniture , on view at the museum from May 1 until October 31 , 2006 , is the first time this group has been shown together . Photograph Fig. 3 .

New France , which began as a trading outpost established by Samuel de Champlain ( 1567-1635 ) in 1608 , was one of the earliest European settlements in North America . France was heavily in debt during most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and looked at this western settlement as a profit center through the fur trade and the Atlantic fishery . It was also expected to provide profitable markets for French manufactures at a minimum cost to the mother country . // Fig. 4 .

In 1720 there were 24,000 settlers along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only grown to 55 , 000 compared to the American colonies , which had 1.5 million inhabitants at the same time.3 // Fig. 5 . Advertisement of C. W. Lyon in The Magazine ANTIQUES , vol. 67 , no. 6 ( June 1955 ) , p. 449. // The social structure of New France was a microcosm of the mother country . In North America , the power of the French king was delegated to a governor . A civil administrator , or intendant , controlled the material affairs of the colony ; the clergy , particularly the Jesuits and Sulpicians , had charge of spiritual matters ; and the seigneurs , whose social status resembled that of the French aristocracy , rented land to the farmers who settled it.4 Because boats and canoes along the Saint Lawrence River and its tributaries were the only means of transport , surveyed land was laid out in long narrow strips running back from the river so that every parcel had access to the waterway . This resulted in houses clustered together for protection . In 1749 the resulting pattern of settlement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " a continuous village , which begins at Montreal and stretches all the way to Quebec . " 5 This uninterrupted ribbon of houses was constantly razed by fire . The earliest buildings of New France were constructed primarily of wood , which was readily available and cheaper than masonry . The settlers ' priority was to build houses that could survive the long cold winters and withstand attacks from the Indians . These one- or two-room houses had walls two to four feet thick , steeply gabled roofs designed to shed snow , and one or two chimneys . In 1682,1845 , and 1881 , a large part of Quebec burned . Montreal suffered a similar fate in 1721 and 1852 , losing two centuries of the handmade objects that expressed the cultural and artistic traditions of French Canada.6 The image in Figure 4 dramatically depicts one of the worst conflagrations in Canada 's history , when more than thirty-one hundred houses and their contents were leveled twice in one month . Photograph Fig. 6 . Detail of Fig. 8 . Duback photograph . // According to one historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-creating the daily life which they had known in France , for although they had arrived with only bare necessities and their courage , the strong traditions of the mother country were still a pan of their make-up.7 However , most commoners arrived in the New World with a single chest containing their clothes . Only church dignitaries and civil governors had financial means and were able to bring furniture . To furnish their houses , the early settlers relied on woodworkers rather than cabinetmakers . Menuisiers and charpentiers worked in solid woods by traditional carpenters ' techniques while the more elite French bnistes specialized in complex shaping , carving , inlaid marquetry veneers , ormolu , gilding and lacquer finishes . In the small , scattered , and hardly wealthy colony of New France , needs rather than fashion trends governed form and construction.8 Furniture was built by local joiners , a talented family member , or even the carpenter who constructed the house . They followed the medieval craft tradition of joining tenoned cross members and mortised uprights , securing them with wooden pins rather than nails or glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the top slat cut completely through the back posts rather than stopped . The makers used forged ( before 1850 ) and square ( after 1850 ) nails . They relied on native woods : thick boards of white pine , which were easy to use and resistant to rot , splitting , and warping , supplemented by yellow birch and maple for turned elements . Although oak was plentiful , it was considered too hard to work efficiently . Photograph Fig. 7 . Ile d'Orlans side chair , Quebec , 1750-1800 .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , copying the Indians , who used these materials for snowshoe webbing . Rawhide strips were boiled and , while hot , stretched during weaving . The rawhide shrank when it dried , assuring a tight chair seat . Forged iron hinges were made by local blacksmiths and consisted of simple loop over pin types ( see Fig. 2 ) , which allowed armoire doors to be opened easily and lifted off . Some were strengthened with a rattail extension ( see Fig. 6 ) anchored to the corner post with a small screw . Trickle down design and distinctive decorative motifs further differentiate furniture made in New France from its American counterparts . While Thomas Chippendale ( 1718-1779 ) , George Hepplewhite ( d. 1786 ) , and Thomas Sheraton ( 1751-1806 ) influenced the humblest American knockoffs , French Canada still bowed to the styles of Louis XIII ( r. 1610-1643 ) and Louis XV ( r. 1715-1774 ) , since Normandy , Brittany , and the le de France supplied generations of French emigrants to Canada . Early French colonists brought their collective memory and knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Furniture inspired by the Louis XIII era was massive and linear with decorative motifs based primarily on geometric shapes and turned supports . In contrast , the lyrical Louis XV style drew its inspiration from the human body both in scale and line and thus was characterized by serpentine curves and shaped edges . Modified by time and distance these French prototypes imbued French-Canadian furniture with its distinctive provincial character . The colors the colonists used to dress up their furniture and protect it from soot and stains probably had symbolic implications . In the European tradition , blues and greens , based on vegetable dyes , have sacred and secular connotations respectively . Blue is the predominant color in stained-glass windows of the great French Gothic cathedrals and has always been associated with royalty and the French flag . Green was the principal shade for foliage , leaves , and boughs in Flemish tapestry wall hangings and upholstery . It stood for hope , renewal , and regeneration . Red , derived from animal blood ( sang de boeuf ) represented the passion of Christ and the bonfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It carried the sacred connotations of divine love . Initially yellow was rarely if ever used , as it was a symbol of cowardice , disease , and cuckoldry . In France it was smeared on the doors of traitors and denoted inconstancy , jealousy , and adultery.9 Photograph Fig. 9 . Double rocking chair , Quebec , 1850-1875 .

Author 's collection ; Duback photograph . // The French-Canadian farmers and townspeople living in rural Quebec since the seventeenth century required furnishings that were useful , massive , and sturdy . Based on inventories , even the most modest nineteenth-century farmhouse had a buffet ( see Fig. 8 ) , an armoire ( see Fig. 14 ) , several blanket boxes ( see Fig. 11 ) , a doughboy , a large table , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all of which are represented in the Shelburne Museum collection.10 One of the most important pieces of furniture in the French joiner 's repertory and the settlers ' houses was the buffet ( Fig. 8 ) , made of pine and assembled with pinned mortise and tenon joints . The interior is fitted with shelves for the storage of ceramics , linens , or cutlery . The buffet 's most distinctive design features are the raised linen-fold panels and the diamond point or lozenge patterns on both the front and sides of the case . The faceted lozenge motif originated during the reign of Louis XIII and persisted in Canadian work more than one hundred years later . The rattail door hinges ( see Fig. 6 ) and the pierced so-called seahorse escutcheon on the proper right door of the buffet in Figure 8 are examples of an eighteenth-century Quebec blacksmith s work at its finest . The yellow paint is a later addition over the original sang de boeuf . The doors in Figure 2 are from a cupboard built into the wall of a French-Canadian house . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboards and armoires and over time sold separately to collectors . " The doors illustrated have the raised panels , hollow-cut corners , and loop hinges accommodating pins affixed to the missing case associated with late eighteenth-century design . The original red paint has polychrome floral decoration that is part of the naturalistic vocabulary of the Louis XV period and may be a later addition.12 Photograph Fig. 11 . Lift-top chest , Quebec , 1775-1800 . Painted pine and iron ; height 25 , width 47 , depth 24 inches . Duback photograph . // The chest shown in Figure 11 is a seventeenth-century form that continued unchanged in French Canada for two hundred years . Such a chest was generally placed beside or at the foot of the bed , where it not only held linen but was also used as a step when climbing into bed . Sometimes chests were placed against the wall of the common room where they served as a seat.13 Instead of being constructed with dovetails or panels set into frames , as they would have been in France , the single-board sides are slotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins . This construction method continued into the eighteenth century and beyond . FrenchCanadian wooden buildings were often constructed in this manner , with logs tongued on each end and then fitted into channeled vertical posts-a technique known as pice-sur-pice.14 The V-shaped molding beneath the lock on this chest is a French-Canadian variation of a European convention in which the V was sometimes inverted . The two-board lid is joined by a center batten dovetailed across the full width of the top . This technique of stabilizing wide flat surfaces is a common feature of French-Canadian box chests.15 An upholstered armchair like the one shown in Figure 13 was a status symbol for a French-Canadian seigneur . The turned front legs with ball feet , square back legs with chamfered corners , and high front and lower H-stretcher arrangement were distinguishing features of the Louis XIII style common to both France and Quebec . The curved and downward-sloping arms that follow the lines of the human body and the high seat back with serpentine crest rail were continued into the late nineteenth century in French Canada . Originally this chair would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitch , a verdant leaf motif , or bargello upholstery , similar to that found on a contemporary purse ( see Fig. 12 ) . The salamander chairs shown in Figures 1 and 5 have alternating turned and square sections derived from a French-Norman form that continued to be made in Quebec for at least a century . These chairs are characterized by front arm supports inserted through the seat frame and into the upper side stretchers , and shaped back slats that have given the chairs their name . The turnings are usually trumpet- or vase-shaped rather than bulbous ; the tops of the rear posts terminate in finials ; and the seats are typically woven rush . The French term for these chairs , la capucine , is derived from the origin of the form in religious institutions . The Sulpicians , a society of priests established in Montreal to evangelize the American Indians , commissioned many of these chairs between 1740 and 1800 . Three dozen examples survive today in the seminary building adjoining the Notre-Dame de Montral Basilica , which has been the home of the Sulpicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was a traditional type commonly found in the Quebec City region in the early eighteenth century . This form-characterized by an open back without spindles or slats-is based on seventeenth-century chairs from the Lorraine region of France . Those chairs also had turned front legs and H-shaped stretchers . Instead of a rush , splint , or upholstered seat , Ile d'Orlans chairs were always fitted with a solid wooden plank nailed onto the frame . The placement of the seat fifteen inches above the floor rather than the standard eighteen or twenty inches found in other North American seating of the same period , is a consistent feature of Canadian side chairs and suggests the short stature of the Quebec people . It is not known whether these simple chairs were produced in large sets , but the museum does own a mate to this example . The traces of blue paint appear to be original . The rocking chair , of which the Shelburne Museum has three , did not appear in Quebec until about 1825 . The double rocking chair shown in Figure 9 is popularly referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady and would have been placed on the front porch . It is made without a center arm or central shaped blade and assembled with turned stretchers rather than mortise and tenon joints . Woven elm bark for the seat was the traditional and preferred material , as reported by this nostalgic writer in 1880 : The old chairs , which in point of comfort , modem times have in no way improved upon , were also of home make , with thin round legs and splint-bottomed seat or what was more common elm bark evenly cut and plaited . Many a time have I gone to the woods in the spring ... and taken the bark in long strips from the elm trees to reseat the dilapidated chairs.17 Children played an important role in large Quebec families . Indeed one author reminiscing about her Franco-American heritage describes " La revanche du berceau " ( The revenge of the cradle ) , which the French used to maintain the balance of the population against the English-speaking Canadians.18 Much scaled-down furniture was designed for their use . Surviving seating furniture , cradles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs for sleeping and eating help paint a vivid picture of childhood in nineteenth-century French Canada . Reminiscing some fifty years later , one writer provided the following commentary on Canadian beds in 1830 : Photograph This page : Fig. 12 . Detail of a purse , Quebec , 1787 . Wool and cotton ; height 3 , width 4 inches overall . Gift of Mrs. Evan Archer ; Duback photogaph. // The great feather tick has been convened into the more healthful mattress , and the straw tick and cords have been replaced by spring bottoms . It used to be quite an arduous undertaking , I remember , to put up one of those old beds . One person took a wrench kept for that purpose , and drew up the cord with it as tight as he could at every hole , and another followed with a hammer and pin , which was driven into the hole through which the end passed to hold it ; and so you went on round the bed , until the cord was all drawn as tight at it could possibly be.19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression " sleep tight . " However , the most significant feature of the Quebec child 's bed shown in Figure 16 is the scalloped head- and footboards and side rails , which clearly reflect the sinuosity of the Louis XV style . French-Canadian cradles ( see Fig. 3 ) are distinguished by their long turned posts that allowed for the use of mosquito netting in summer and a blanket in winter . Rather than butt-jointed or dovetailed , the side boards were usually tongued and pinned into slots in the vertical posts . The double serpentine-shaped headboard and bold rockers are characteristic of Quebec cradles . The rockers could be moved by foot , leaving hands free for other tasks.20 Not unexpectedly , the bottom board of the cradle in Figure 3 is an old replacement , the original having rotted from frequent exposure to urine.21 At some point in its history , small holes were made in the sides of the cradle through which a cord could be passed to secure the child .

Duback photograph . // The amount of homemade children 's seating furniture that survives is remarkable ( see Figs. 17 , 18 , and 19 ) . The curved rungs and the absence of a footrest on the high chair in Figure 18 suggest an early nineteenthcentury date of manufacture . Small potty chairs like the one in Figure 19 were used in Europe from the early seventeenth century . A hole in the center of the seat covered a freestanding pewter or wooden chamber pot , placed on the floor below . The original ocher painted surface here is a remarkable survival . Although many children took their meals in high chairs pushed up to their parents ' table , toddlers after the age of about eighteen months also sat at low tables on small chairs such as the one in Figure 17 . In 1763 New France was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris , ending the Seven Years ' Wars and altering the populations government forever . Under British rule , French-Canadian life , based on agriculture , trapping , and fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century and a half . The English-speaking population eventually became the strongest political force , resulting in the partition of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada in 1791 . This division left a French-speaking Roman Catholic agrarian majority widely dispersed on the land and in numerous small villages in the south , and an English-speaking Protestant mercantile and commercial minority concentrated in the cities of Quebec and Montreal.22 In the English-dominated urban areas with their rapidly growing wealth after about 1780 , the home furnishings of choice brought by officers , merchants , and administrators were Anglo-American . The introduction of designs by Hepplewhite , Sheraton , and Robert Adam ( 1728-1792 ) that were current throughout the British Empire reflected this change in taste . Corner cupboards became common in the rural districts of French Canada toward the end of the eighteenth century . At first built into the common room of the house , they provided both storage and display for ceramics . They continued to be made until the middle of the nineteenth century as freestanding pieces , often influenced by the styles imported from British cabinetmakers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the overall rectilinear shape , the massive multilayered cornice built up with applied moldings , and the shallow recessed door panels . Despite remnants of many surface pigments , the original paint-below the repainted surface-appears to be a gray-blue color . The monumental storage unit in Figure 14 illustrates English cabinetmaking traditions in the classically inspired triglyphs and compass stars , gouged motifs , and dents de loup ( wolf 's teeth ) shaped ornaments on the cornice , as well as the curvilinear base derived from a Hepplewhite design . The emphasis on molding in shallow relief is the most noticeable stylistic feature of Adam furniture and is evident in the triple beading around the door opening that is repeated on the edges of the corner posts to resemble classical reeding . The interior is fitted with shelves to hold folded linens . The current blue surface is a later addition . Armoires did not usually have pulls . The key in the lock served to open the proper left-hand door , while the proper right door was secured by a hook and eye of forged iron , attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . The penciled inscription " Auguste Fortin/St . Armand/P . Que. " is the only written documentation on any of Shelburne 's Quebec furniture and suggests the cupboard 's history . Saint Armand was part of the old seigneurie established in 1733 and was located just across the border from what is now northern Vermont near Interstate 89 . When the Americans declared their independence in 1776 , those supporting the monarchy fled north to British Canada . The colonial government there welcomed these new and politically loyal settlers who made their homes in the Eastern Townships.23 This neoclassically inspired cupboard clearly reflects the demographics of the population , which was predominantly English speaking at the time . However , in the 1850s , the economy 's driving forces , the railroad and the forestry industries , employed many French Canadians who eventually became local landowners , tipping the balance toward a primarily francophone population . One of these later emigrants was probably Auguste Fortin . He inscribed his name on this cupboard as an owner after the Confederation of 1847 that established Quebec as a province .

Immigrants from Ireland brought the so-called settle-bed to Canada at the beginning of the nineteenth century . The front and seat are rigidly joined and hinged at the bottom and front to fold out and down as a large open box with a straw pallet inside . As such , the bench-bed is the predecessor of the Castro convertible . A bane-lit could hold adult visitors or as many as four children , who slept feet to feet . Serving as a seat during the day and as a bed at night , this unique form was common in rural homes with large families . The surviving furniture of Quebec clearly provides insight into the life and times of its users . Many of the French immigrants were poor farmers who struggled to support large families in a brutal climate , and who relieved monotonous whitewashed walls and board floors with colorfully painted furniture . The high survival rate of rocking chairs suggests theirs was a family-centered culture that cared about the comfort of their elderly .
