General Douglas MacArthur got an entirely new top air command last week . His second in command , speechmaking Lieut . General George Howard Brett-an oldtimer of the Air Forces-was replaced by bristly-haired , tiny ( 5 ft. 6 ) Major General George C. Kenney . <P> Fact is that MacArthur 's air force in Australia has had many obstacles to contend with-including deficiencies in the quality and number of planes available . But it also has by &; large no outstanding record for getting results . Its most obvious failure was in not successfully interfering with the Jap landing at Buna ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) , the landing which resulted in last week 's threat to Port Moresby . <P> In recent months many junior air commanders in Australia have been replaced so that their age level has fallen rapidly . General Brett and his three senior officers , all replaced , are aged 56 , 52 , 53 , 58 . General Kenney is 53 and his three new senior officers , Brigadier Generals Ennis Whitehead , Kenneth Walker and Emmett O'Donnell , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation that the experience of officers who had been through the tough school of real warfare in the east was needed at home ( two of them have already been assigned to training commands in the south ) is legitimate . But obviously General MacArthur will be better off trying an entirely new combination in place of a combination which did not get outstanding results . <P> The changes , although announced last week , were made a fortnight or more ago . Recent reports from Australia indicate that MacArthur 's fighters and bombers have been hitting the Japs harder and oftener-and on the face of it , at least with better results ( see p. 34 ) . <P> General Kenney is relatively unknown - he is a former commander of the Air Corps Experimental Depot and Engineering School at Wright Field , Ohio , flew in World War I-has yet to prove that he can do what others did not . " Nobody 's kidding me about this show , " he declared last week .               @ @ @ @ @ @
