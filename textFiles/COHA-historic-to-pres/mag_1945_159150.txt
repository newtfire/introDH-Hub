Paris Underground ( United Artists ) is based on the best seller about two women who helped smuggle some 200 British soldiers back to England . The book was authentic enough to have caused trouble for a number of real French undergrounders . The screen version will probably cause trouble to nobody except , perhaps , Constance Bennett . It-is her first venture as a producer . <P> This curtailed , modified account of the ladies ' exploits ( Miss Bennett plays a rather fast estranged wife ) seems a little obsolescent by now and also not much like the real thing . But as a piece of melodramatic , patriotic entertainment it has its points . The producer 's feminine touch can be seen in some intricately propped interiors and a very pretty sequence of a rain-drenched funeral procession . Gracie Fields ' performance as the English spinster is near perfect . And Connie Bennett herself , who has lost nothing of her tough , wiry glamor with the years , gives fine style and energy to the international-smart-set aspects of her role . But she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple embarrassment . <P> The Producer . Miss Bennett is not easily embarrassed . " After all , " as she explained , " I 'm not getting any younger she will be 40 this month and this being glamorous ca n't go on forever . I do n't see why I should n't get established as a producer . " <P> It was neither quite as simple nor as easy as that . Constance Bennett is a veteran actress , highly experienced and highly opinionated . " All my life , " she says , " I knew what was wrong with production , but this is the first time I could say , ' Wait a minute , let 's fix it . ' " Apparently she said this often ( to everybody from scriptwriter to booking agent ) , regally and grimly ( because she desperately wanted to succeed in her new role ) . <P> Director Gregory Ratoff played ineffectual hide- &-seek; with Miss Bennett in the murkier shadows of the soundstage , but generally had to wind up the game with a shrug : " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now &; again anxious , imperious Producer Bennett asked fellow-producer Darryl F. Zanuck to look at the rushes ; but it is reasonable to suspect that Mr. Zanuck did not take too much responsibility for the picture . <P> Yet Zanuck and other seasoned Hollywood geniuses have made worse movies . All in all , Paris Underground ought not to lose Miss Bennett any money . If it should , she is unlikely to starve . Currently she is <P> 1 ) acting in Fox 's Centennial Summer , 2 ) doing a daily 15-minute radio show for ABC , 3 ) helping run the New York firm of Constance Bennett Cosmetics Co. by long distance telephone , 4 ) designing a line of Constance Bennett Frocks which will be brought out this fall , 5 ) getting ready to start a daily syndicated newspaper column , 6 ) preparing for an overseas U.S.O. entertainment tour . <P> The House on 92nd Street ( 20th Century-Fox ) . When a personable , athletic young German-American named William Dietrich ( William Eythe ) graduated from a midwestern college in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazis . How would he like to take a tour through Germany , with all expenses paid and perhaps study in a Hamburg university for a while ? When Dietrich reported this offer to the FBI , he was told to accept it .
