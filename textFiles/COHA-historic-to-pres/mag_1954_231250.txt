In a grey , blitz-battered part of London , between the Thames and St. Paul 's Cathedral , is a rubble-littered hole where a 14-story office building will soon rise . Since that part of London stands on many layers of history , Archaeologist William Grimes of the London Museum got permission to dig a trench to see what lay deeper down . <P> First he uncovered a wall of Roman age ; then the foundations of an ancient building came slowly to light . About 60 ft. long and 22 ft. wide , it looked a good deal like an early Christian church , with a central nave , two side aisles and a rounded apse at one end . In the apse the diggers found the marble head , delicately carved , of a god in a Phrygian cap . Then they knew that the ruin was a temple of Mithras , built about A.D. 150 , where armored Roman legionnaires worshiped , particularly during the dying years of the Roman empire , when the Mithras cult was most popular . <P> If the Mithras worshipers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of St. Paul 's Cathedral not far from their temple , they would find many things , besides the arrangement of the interior , to remind them of their own faith . Of Aryan origin , Mithraism was one of the Oriental sects that contended for control of the declining Roman Empire . It came out second in the contest , but it had some things in common with Christianity , the winner . <P> Mithras , whose name leads back to Aryan prehistory , was a kind of redeemer , a mediator between man and a supreme god . Born miraculously ( out of a rock ) , he was first adored by gift-bearing shepherds . He suffered various adversities but at last ascended to heaven . Mithraism used bells and candles in its ritual , as well as communion and holy water . It taught immortality of the soul , the resurrection of the flesh and the last judgment . <P> Londoners by tens of thousands crowded to glimpse the low , muddy wall of the temple . Hearing that it would soon make room for an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldfashioned , ritualistic Socialists insisted on calling it-Britons went home in their time-honored way to write protesting letters to the newspapers . The press responded thunderously , and the owners of the site agreed to preserve the temple for at least a fortnight , until someone could figure out how to preserve Mithras ' old home .
