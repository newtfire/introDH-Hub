For years the outlawed Irish Republican Army has refused to recognize the - authority of the Irish Republic 's Parliament , contending that doing so would bestow legitimacy on the British partition of Ireland . That has not stopped the I.R.A . ' s political wing , Sinn Fein , from contesting seats in the 166- member Dail , the assembly . But once elected , Sinn Fein winners have always boycotted the Dail . Last week Sinn Fein reversed its policy and said its candidates will take seats if elected . <P> The vote was a victory for Sinn Fein 's president , Gerry Adams , 38 , who had argued that electoral participation is the " only feasible way out of our isolation . " Some 130 hard-core " abstentionists , " however , promptly formed a breakaway group . Meanwhile , Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald called the party 's attempt to hold public office " an abuse of the democratic system . "
