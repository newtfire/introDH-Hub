The leading produce markets were again very Irregular to-day . Grain was generally stronger on the fact of smaller receipts , though wheat was tame , and provisions were generally higher , except on November pork . The tendency in most directions was to an advance , largely on local reasons . Provisions were irregular , with fair activity in trading , November pork was weak , declining 22S4 cents , and closed 10 cents lower than on Tuesday afternoon , Other deliveries of pork were strong in the forenoon , fell back , and improved at the close to 20 cents above the latest prices of Tuesday .

Meats were weak early , but much stronger toward 1 o'clock ; November closed SO cents higher and January 20 cents higher . The packers here were supposed to have quit bearing the market , and Liverpool called lard ad. higher , but the local hog market was easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pioduet , and the later strength was supposed to bo largely duo to the sympathy with corn . It was said that hogs are not being fattened rapidly yet . While there was a sharp Southern demand for meats and a poor inquiry for them on English account this afternoon , the market was firm . Only one 210-barrel lot of November pork was delivered on the floor after ' Change , and that was taken to ship East . The shrinkage of the No ? vember premium to nearly zero called out a good shipping demand for pork late in the day . Wheat was moderately active and stronger , in sympathy witn corn it averaged at the close about Si cent above the latest prices of Tuesday . Liverpool and London were firm , with a fair inquiry , and our receipts were less than 200 car-loads of all grades . But Milwaukee was easier . and parties connected with that city were selling rather freely here , while the buying was mostly done to fill shorts . This demand fell off later , when some private cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear lots at a shade advance for No. 2 Spring , which was taken to deliver In December , while buyers of other grades were not willing to p y more than they aid on Tuesday .

The bearis'i tendency of the past week seemed to change round to exaggeration the other way , and the speculative demand was at times quite urgent , it be:rs freely predicted that corn is going to advance sharply . The point was tuntio that we have only about 200,000 bushels of No. 2 here , with scarcely any comin , in , and New-York wants all that can be got . hold of up to the last moment that it can he shipped by all rail , to arrive in November . This month advanced 14 cent on the afternoon call , while other futures were steady . We are now reversing the ancient order of things in regard to cribbing corn . To-day a lot was brought here to he delivered back in the country in May . It is noteworthy that no corn has yet been cribbed this year , and there are no reports of preparations for cribbing . The price is too high to tempt capital . At last November pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . This is what the packers have fought for during nearly a month nest .. There was a good deal more inquiry to-day for freight room direct to Europe .
