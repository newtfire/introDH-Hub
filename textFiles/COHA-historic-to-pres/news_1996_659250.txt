C.J. Rose squints beneath his sweat-stained cap and scans the sun-scorched wheat fields that support his family . What he sees scares him . <p> Dead tired and coated with dust , the lanky farmer-rancher has little to show for months of plowing and planting but a stretch of shriveled stalks of wheat embedded in crusty , parched earth . <p> " It 's been like the dream you always had has come to an end in a cloud of dust , " Rose says , his voice husky , his shoulders slumped in dejection . " What people do n't understand is I can work all year as hard as I can and I 'm not going to get paid for it . " <p> Harvest has come to the Great Plains and fears of failure - or even total collapse - loom for thousands of wheat farmers and cattle ranchers struggling through one of the worst droughts this patch of the Panhandle has seen since the Dust Bowl era . Oklahoma 's losses alone will exceed a billion dollars . <p> It has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass for cows to graze . Lighter cattle mean lower prices . And less money means more trouble for Carl J. Rose , who works the same land his father tended and his grandfather homesteaded 75 years ago . <p> " It seems like the harder we try , the worse we get , " the 36-year-old farmer says , grabbing a chunk of cocoa-colored dirt so dry it slips through his fingers like sand . " I 've never been so depressed in my whole life . " <p> Come July , Rose faces his first financial squeeze : some $ 30,000 in bills . A small plot of decent-sized wheat he expected to salvage was destroyed , ironically , by water - a May hailstorm . He did n't sell his cattle , either , because they would n't bring what he owes on them . <p> So he trudges on , working a second job with the county road department , rattling along in his rusty 1980 blue Chevy pickup that has logged its 200,000th mile and hoping his bank will help him hang on . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose family name has been on the deed to this land ever since the county started keeping records . " I 've got a little boy who 's 6 years old . All he wants to do is farm . I 'd sure like for him to farm . I 'd like for him to eat . You ca n't do both . At least it seems that way . " <p> For many here , this will be a harvest of hardship . <p> In the Beaver County area , where nature 's caprices can make or break lives , only 1.6 inches of rain fell from October through April - slightly more than a quarter the normal amount of precipitation . <p> Oklahoma is expected to have its smallest wheat crop in 25 years . <p> Up to 85 percent of the county 's winter wheat - including abandoned acres - could be lost . Some area farmers , having endured drought , hail and a freeze the past three years , face a possible fourth straight disaster . <p> Already , trouble signs are evident along the two-lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howls of coyotes pierce the night and a mere 6,000 souls share an area larger than all of Rhode Island ( home to more than 1 million people ) . <p> Normally , the fields are filled with lush , golden grain so thick that it covers the ground like a blanket . Now , there are sickly , ankle-high strands of wheat sprouting from land with cracks so wide you can fit your hand in them . <p> This is ranching country , too - a roadside sign proclaims " Watch Your Curves , Eat More Beef " - but livestock dealers have n't fared much better with cattle prices at a five-year low . <p> With pastures too dry for grazing and feed costs too high , many ranchers were forced to sell off herds at lower weights and cheaper prices - sometimes a half or a third of last year 's going rates . <p> " They do n't WANT to get rid of their factories . It 's their livelihood , " says Bill Skaggs , standing in his Beaver City Stockyards , surrounded by cowboy paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake . " It 's really a Catch-22 . They 're just doing what they need to survive . That 's all . " <p> But that 's become harder with increasing business costs : Fertilizer prices rose by as much as 75 percent and diesel prices by up to 50 percent over a year ago . <p> " It 's very hard to make it , " says farmer-rancher Jerald Radcliff . " You can not stop the expenses . You spend $ 75 to $ 80 an acre to plant the crop , then you do n't get anything in return . " <p> The Drought of ' 96 already has ravaged wide stretches of the Plains , causing staggering losses for parts of Kansas , Colorado and New Mexico and large sections of Oklahoma and Texas . <p> Texas , for instance , is enduring its second-worst natural disaster - behind 1983 's Hurricane Alicia with its $ 3 billion price tag . If there is n't significant rain during the summer , the $ 2.4 billion drought loss could double by September , state experts say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month estimated drought-related losses at up to $ 1.2 billion , with about 10 percent of the 71,000 producers expected to go bankrupt or quit farming . <p> " If somebody gave up a piece of land 10 years go , there 'd be a number of people waiting in line to farm it , " Radcliff says . " Today , you 'd have to go begging . " <p> The drought inevitably brings comparisons to the " Dirty 30s , " the local nickname for the Dust Bowl days , when fierce winds whipped up clouds of dirt so dense it buried homes , turned roads into dunes and day into night . <p> Those scenes wo n't recur . More sophisticated farm tools , replanting and different conservation methods reduce wind erosion and prevent the soil from blowing away into dust . <p> Still , some see that hard-luck era as the yardstick of endurance . <p> " I read the Book of James a whole lot , " says Guy Payne , a fifth-generation rancher who works a second job processing animals at a feed lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tribulations . " <p> " There 's guys who made it in the ' 30s , " he says . " There 's guys who are going to make it in the ' 90s . And I 'm going to be one of them . " <p> Chris Smith did n't make it . <p> After 13 years of building his cattle herd , Smith , 36 , was forced to sell his animals this spring and give up the only life he 's ever had - and ever wanted . <p> His debts had surpassed $ 400,000 , his bank would n't give him any more loans and there was no grass to feed the cattle , no money to buy alfalfa and no way to make ends meet . <p> " It 's been an extremely painful ordeal , " says Smith , a short , husky man with a gentle manner . " It 's like when a loved one is dying of a slow cancer that is eating them away . The end is near , but you hold on as long as you can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but thought he and his wife , Judy , could lease some grassland so that one day they could pass their farm to a fourth generation , their 14-year-son . <p> The drought changed that . <p> Smith fits into the category bankers say are at greatest risk : younger , highly leveraged producers who were on the edge even before the drought . <p> So on a morning in late May , Smith hauled the last 120 of his herd on a 25-mile drive from his home in Meade , Kan. , to the Beaver City Stockyards , which has seen its business double in recent months . <p> Smith 's beloved animals were hustled into a ring as the auctioneer 's hiccuping patter filled the air . Tobacco-chewing buyers in straw cowboy hats and silver spurs quietly bid with a few hand signals . <p> Within moments , his animals were sold - at about 50 percent of last year 's prices . <p> " It was like selling part of my family , " Smith says , his eyes welling with tears . " But when the figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drought is facing you , you have to be realistic . You have to get what you can . " <p> Smith says he has reduced his debts to more than $ 100,000 but still worries . " You ca n't breathe a sigh of relief because you do n't know what the banks are going to do , " says the father of four who lives with his family in a house owned by his uncle . <p> Smith hopes to make a deal with his creditors that will avoid bankruptcy , and he knows he 's in for a period of adjustment . <p> " Farming is the only life I 've ever known , " he says . " It 's like asking ' What do you miss about not going home ? ' " <p> He admits , too , that he still is haunted by decisions he made that put him in this predicament , and he wonders if he would have been better off if he had quit earlier . <p> " Sure , you beat yourself up , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad because the drought is pushing a lot of us over the edge . The one thing you ca n't second-guess is the weather .
