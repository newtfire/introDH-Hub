We have been . ashore . at last , if one can call a floating sheet of bay ' ice a shore , but as the entire barrier is supposed to be . ifloat , we have at least been on its doorstep . About two-thirds of the ? ships company are out on the ice in this ' snug harbor , playing with penguins , skiing and hunting seals to get meat for the dogs . ' We reached the barrier , yesterday at Long . 177:25 W. and cruised along it all last night and ? this morning . With all we . had .. readd-af this wall of ice . we found ? t4g , no pictures or descriptions ; of it could convey an adequate impression . - It rose eighty or ninety feet : high , majestic and - forbidding , . beautiful and terrible . We watched it ? for.the most part silently , : mariting tbe clean lines of cleavage , where great bergs have broken off , ? , the caves into which the waves dashed , the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reach Discovery . Inlet . ' As we moved eastward Frank T. Davies , the physicist , ' and Quin . A. Blackburn , the topographer ; sketched the face of ? the ' barrier and - soundings were taken every hour .. They showed depths ranging from 250 to 300 fathoms at distances from a mile to three miles off shore . About 8 o'clock in the morning Commander Byrd had predicted - we should see the beginning of Discovery Inlet , and just about that time we sighted what at first was believed to be a distant ice floe , ' or ' berg . glance at the chart , however , convinced the Commander that we were in the mouth of this wide bay . That opinion was justified a short time later when with glasses we were able to see that the walls of the inlet were coming together to the east . Ice Anchors Thrown Out .. - Three hours later we were well inside where the inlet narrows to- a. width of only two or three miles . A short run brought us to the , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowest part of the inlet , and here we came alongside the ice , threw out two ice anchors and made them fast . There ? was a scramble to be . the first one over the side , and Captain Alton Parker of the Marine Corps won by a second . " The marines are always the first ashore , " he yelled back . A moment later and the ice near the ship was covered with men , running to stretch their legs and pelting each other with snowballs . Lying Against White Cliffs of Ice . Imagine a long narrow bay where instead of land , the walls are glistening white cliffs of snow and ice:rising sheer above the - water . The bay ice runs in a long curve between these walls , which stretch inland . for miles , and against the edge of this ice we are now lying . . . We are not more than 100 yards from the barrier , which here iv about 100 feet high . The walls . are broken and . worn ? insome places , and as smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he base are beautiful ice caves at which the light shines with the Most ' perfect blue imaginable , a light sat'and yet brilliant . ? Hunt for a Landing Field . - . As soon as we had made fast - Commander Byrd , with Bernt Balchen , Bosun Strom , Carl 0 . , Petersen , . the radio man , and Christopher . B , raathen , seaman and skiman , went inland to try to locate a landing field at-the edge of the barrier . Such a field could be used ' base for exploring the barrier and also there has always been the . po : +-. sibility that Discovery would make a better base than the Bay a Whales ; although the bay would be much nearer to the area which Commander Byrd wishes to explore : - They are still away and will not return for several hours . They are traveling on skis - and when they reach the barrier will be tied together with Alpine rope . Another party composed of Captain Parker , pilot ; N. D. Vaughan and Jacob Bursey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get seals which are lying there in the sun . We need them for food for ourselves , and it is necessary to lay in as large a store as ppossible , and also for the dogs . Obseturing Clouds Roll Away . In these few minutes the clouds , which obscured the sun , , have rolled away and the entire bay is a shining place of blue and white , wonderfully beautiful in this clear atmosphere . It Is the ' cleanest place in the world , a spotless wilderness . ' - - Dean Smith started off to hunt Seals , but on the way he found two Adelie penguins which interested him so much that he stopped to play With them . They regarded him with friendly and curious eyes until he tried to pick one up . Then he found that the little fellows could fight with their flippers and bite with their beaks . ' He brought them back , finally , with many bruises on his arms and legs and posed them in front of the cameras of Willard Vandervcer and Joseph T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side with ' the first and hive been busier than , bird dogs ever since , trying to keep up with what has been going on . But the real fun began when an Emperor penguin walked : up to wa- , come us , an official greeter of the Antarctic , resplendent in white shirt front , frock coat , a long brilliant black beak , celdied purple On the sides , and with bright yellow spots on each side of his neck . He was a Most imposing bird and regarded us with just the proper touch of scornful toleration . He was at least three and a half feet high and weighed about sixty pounds and with his powerful flippers - made an antagonist not to be laughed at . Harold June , the navy pilot , regarded the emperor for a time and made up his mind that it should be his , or at least should be photographed in a proper state of subjection . So Harold walked up and held out his arms , looking for a grip on the disdainful bird , which turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regarded the emperor with more respect . A Battle Royal Follows . He made another attempt to grab him and was unmercifully nipped . Then he dove and bird and pilot rolled over in the snow to the sound of grunts and whacks of flippers and loud squawking protests from the penguin . It was a battle royal for a moment , and June is a strong man , but he finally found that by tackling hard , bolding his bead down and out of the way of the beak and wrapping both arms around the flippers and then lying on his majesty , he could hold him . June then roped the penguin and brought *him in front of the camera , protesting every inch of the way When he was released , he drew himself up with a dignity which made us rather ashamed of having roped so kingly a bird . Several little Adelie penguins had been running around in the meantime , sliding on their bellies and making a tremendous row when anyone tried to catch them . Much to our surprise , they repelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go Wild in the Snow . Some of the dogs were taken out on the ice and went wild with joy at getting ashore where they could run . In sheer exuberance of spirits they bit some of the dog drivers and would dive at the snow and roll over in it and rub their heads in it . Walden got his team over , hitched it up and took Captain Melville for a ride . He is now out , bringing in some of the seal meat . The dogs travel fast on this smooth surface and pull the sled along as if it were the best fun in the world . A short time ago they saw some men dragging a sea/ in , and the whole pack broke into a run and raced over to look over this new source of food . Killing seals seems rather brutal at first , but it is done only because it is necessary , and no one enjoys it . ' The ice is breaking up where we are moored and in a short time it will probably be necessary t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake which is now Splitting off from the main pack . Speedy Start for Bay of Whales . Tomorrow , or possibly tonight , we expect to start for the Bay of Whales to see what the conditions are there . We hope that if the ice is not out it will be as thick as it is here , where we could easily take our materials ashore . It is good to be actually at work on the continent ; the point for which all the long months of preparation have been aimed . So far we have been favored by excellent weather and we are all hoping that it will continue . There is so much to be done with so little time in which to do it .
