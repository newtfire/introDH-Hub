Perhaps working on a Hollywood project helped form this new tale , a terrific cinematic look at one of the iconic heroes of the twentieth century . This issue started with a story of knights and wizards , and now it ends with the tale of an iconic hero of more recent vintage-you 'll recognize him at once . The question Mr. McAllister poses is , what sort of opportunities does the modern world offer to someone looking to live Happily Ever After ? Bruce McAllister notes he 's currently working on a screenplay adaptation of his 1988 novel Dream Baby with TV and film writer Mike Ajakwe . Perhaps you 'll see a bit of the Hollywood influence in this story . <p> " We 're in this together , are n't we , Steve ? " - Janie , The Blob " When man entered the atomic age , he opened a door into a new world . What we will eventually find in that new world nobody can predict .... " - Dr. Medford , Them ! " An atom bomb could n't eradicate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire ant , National Geographic , Feb. 1997 THE PITCH THIS ROMANTIC COMEDY begins where all low-budget " 50s creature-features ended : The mutant insects born of atom-bomb radiation ( or invaders from space , or monsters from the sea , or fifty-foot women ) have at last been defeated and our small-town hero , with girlfriend Janie or June or Betty at his side , must now face the rest of his life . Did n't we wonder what his life would be like after the final credits rolled ? After you save the world , what 's left ? You can marry the Professor 's daughter , sure . You can sell the rights to your story . Be on national talk shows . Hold onto fame a little longer . But then what ? THE BACKSTORY The day the giant angry , hungry locusts reached McCulloughville , Nevada ( pop . 2000 , Elks , Lions , VFW ) , Rick Rowe was twenty-one . He 'd never been to college , but that was okay . He 'd never even been to Reno , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red " " 5 7 BelAir convertible he was proud of ; and though he knew his parents disapproved , he liked drag racing it with his friends from high school . He 'd kissed a girl or two , sure , and even gotten to second base with them , but not without some guilt . He was an upstanding hometown kid and everyone knew it . After all , his parents were fine people . Mr. Rowe was an officer at the McCulloughville Bank ; Mrs. Rowe , a housewife . If there was one thing to be said about McCulloughville in 2005 , it was that it - and everyone in it - was trapped in the " 50s . The golden-oldies stations that managed to reach the car radios played " 50s songs , and the parents still talked like Ward and June Cleaver . It was a town ripe for " 50s mutant locusts . Before the mutants ever showed their antennae in McCulloughville , Rick knew insects . One of his responsibilities at the Grange - his job since high school - was to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without pesticides that would poison the grain . Livestock sometimes ate the grain . Family pets sometimes did too . You could n't sell poisoned seed . And locusts had always marched through the grass valleys of Northern Nevada . Rick had , by necessity , become an " ecologist " when no one else in town knew what the word meant . He 'd talked to old-timers , read books , and knew what kinds of insects you could put in the grain to eat the insects that ate the grain . Assassin bugs ate boll weevils . Parasite wasps ate assassin bugs . He knew about insect hunger , and when the locusts hatched like bulldozers from the soil of Duffer 's Dry Lake and flew the thirty miles to the ranches that surrounded McCulloughville , it did n't actually surprise him . He heard their wings that first night and somehow knew what it was even when others thought it was just the wind , or bad radio reception , or jets from Nellis . Even when the locusts marched on the Grange itself and Rick barely escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hungry . They were a whole lot bigger than they were supposed to be , but if you thought about it , that was reason enough to be hungry and angry . They could fly . The brown stuff they spit - the " tobacco " - was corrosive and so foul-smelling it was as effective as mustard gas . Their chitinous exoskeletons were impervious to flamethrowers or armor-piercing , teflon-coated .357 magnum slugs in the hands of the State Police . Their ganglia were n't sophisticated enough to be bothered by the concussion grenades . Fuel-air bombs and " daisy cutters " ( ones dropped - thanks to a call from Nevada 's Governor - by aircraft from Nellis Airfield ) killed hundreds , but hundreds more simply took flight to the next town , the next county and its ranches , the next Grange . Towns were being trashed ; the state economy was in tatters ; and the locusts were about to deposit their titanic eggs in the endless stretches of dry Nevada soil . Was the end of life as we know it near ? Hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought - that haunted Rick day and night as the holocaust waxed . A Professor Price from the big university in Reno had come with his daughter ( who assisted him in his work ) and had identified the species ( Melanoplus spretus ) and the source of the mutation ( a fungus that was a mutant itself ) ; but the Professor saw no solution . Hunger . Like an FBI psychopath-tracker trying to get inside his man , Rick got into hunger . He ate . He ate without utensils . He ate a lot . He made himself feel what they must have been feeling , which was : I am growing and no matter how much I eat , IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH . Monsters though they were , they were no different from the boll weevils and potato bugs and seed mites that plagued every Grange in Nevada and that Rick knew so well . According to the Professor , each mutant would keep eating until it was 376 percent larger than it was now - at which point its exoskeleton would no longer be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then its progeny would be out in the world to continue the work - which was eating . That night it came to him : " Ca n't we make them eat each other ? " he asked . The Professor just stared at him . " They are going to eat , whatever we do , Professor . Ca n't we make their very hunger our weapon ? " In a flash the Professor saw it . " Yes ! Pheromones ! " " I do n't understand , Professor . " " Animals smell , Rick : They smell each other If the smell is right , they mate . Another smell , and they eat . They recognize their food by smell , Rick . " " We can make the locusts smell like food ? " " Yes ! " So it was that Rick - a red-blooded American kid who did n't know any world other than his sharp Chevy and a hometown trapped in the " 50s - and a distinguished entomologist from a large university sat down to work out a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified pheromone based on sex hormones but read as " food " by the locusts and sprayed by aircraft on the marching , flying hordes . It was destined to work , so of course it did . The locusts fell upon one other , hunger insatiable , and those that escaped the original spraying were mopped up over the following weeks by more spraying . The gargantuan eggs were never laid and Rick even got to save two little kids from a very irate locust , killing it with a heat-seeking , shoulder-launched Stinger missile . He 'd never been a hero before and it felt good . The TV news footage ( which we 'll see more than once in our story ) shows this : Rick and the Professor and his daughter , Janie Price , standing between them , the carapace of a giant locust out of focus behind them , the sound of jets above them , the sound of giant insect legs rubbing together but fading , and the TV reporter thrusting his mike into Rick 's face with the words : " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it . How did you stop those mutants when no one else - not even the State Police or the Army - could ? Your public wants to know . " THE PRESENT We open eighteen months later on a fine suburban home in southern California , 2005 . It 's Our Hero 's house , of course : His trophies and awards for saving his hometown , the State of Nevada , two little kids , probably the entire world , line the mantelpiece and wall above the fireplace , along with a framed front-page victory story , a wedding portrait of Rick and Janie , assorted pics of their honeymoon in Hawaii six months ago - leis and all . He stopped the giant locusts , became famous , married the girl , sold his story for seven figures . All is as it should be . Or is it ? Rick and Janie are on their way out and we go with them - jet-skiing , para-sailing , and catamaranning in the bay , lunch with friends on a very buff power yacht , romantic dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , but he 's somehow traveled to the new millennium . Right after the defeat of the locusts , we learn , he sold the rights to his story to the nation 's favorite tabloid and he 's affluent now . There 's even talk of a Rick Rowe Show . But we see something in his expression as he plays with his toys and enjoys the good life that says he is n't really happy . He should be , but he 's not . That night he ca n't sleep . We watch him toss , turn , get up . We watch him pad his way over to the DVD player and sixty-three-inch Samsung plasma screen in the living room , insert a DVD , sit down on the Umbrian-modern sofa , and , yes , it 's the news footage of his McCulloughville exploits - in all their " 50s black-and-white glory . He watches with a thousand-yard stare . The footage ends . He goes to menu again , clicks on play , and as he does , Janie - who 's somehow still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this one - emerges sleepy-eyed from the bedroom . " Come to bed , honey , " she says . " Daddy wants you at the lab early tomorrow morning . You do n't want to disappoint him , do you ? " Rick turns it off reluctantly . He really would like to see the footage again , but she 's right - he 's got to get up at five o'clock and make the drive to UCLA , where Professor Price now has an endowed chair thanks to those seminal conference papers he delivered on " Pheromonal Response Confusion in Melanoplus spretus : A Food/Sex Model . " Rick is his laboratory assistant , working once again - but at better pay and benefits - with insects . He does n't need the job - the tabloid money is there - and he wo n't need it later when the movie , book and A.M. talk show deals his agent 's pushing close . But he 's doing it - working - for Janie . He loves her , and she likes the idea of her " two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and famous hero-husband . He goes to bed at last . We hold on his eyes in the dark . They 're open . He 's haunted by something . WHERE RICK 'S LIFE IS HEADING It 's only a week later and Rick is lost . The local press no longer wants follow-up stories . The national press has stopped writing about him completely . The movie has become a low-budget direct-to-video project with " life rights " sold for a paltry $50K , and the talk show has become , if he 's lucky , a gig as " The Bug Whisperer " for Animal Planet . The fact is , Rick is old news , and we know what old news is . He stands around at neighborhood barbecues like a zombie , sits for hours in his parked BMW Land Shark just staring through the glass , and at work is beginning to have " concentration problems . " He does n't want to let the Professor down , but he ca n't help it . He just ca n't seem to focus and his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is happening , but we have our suspicions . We 've seen this before in trauma cases : Inability to concentrate , problem with relationships , low-level depression ... even flashbacks . It 's the start of a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder , of course , and Rick is about to develop a whopper . The Professor gets cranky , Rick snaps back , leaves the lab early , and at home finds Janie gone , note on the fridge : " Gone shopping with Babbs and Dottie . Love , Janie . " He 's angry she 's not there , puts the DVD in again and is still watching it two hours later when Janie arrives , mall buys in hand . She does n't like what she sees . This is n't what a hero does watching old news footage for hours on end . A hero goes out into the world , slays dragons , makes money , sires children , celebrates science and progress with Daddy at the laboratory , does n't he ? She loves him , sure , but all of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger back . That night they make up , try a passionate kiss , but she 's tired . " You can wait , ca n't you , honey ? " " Sure , " Rick says , but it 's the same message he 's getting everywhere . When a guy makes love , he 's a hero - for a moment at least . Ask any teenager . But Rick is n't going to get to be a hero tonight . He 's peevish , feels bad about his peevishness , and gets even more peevish . He looks up at her face in the faint light of the bedroom , and It 's the face of a locust , huge , mandibles grinding , the brown sludge on the lips wet and glistening , the antennae waving at him seductively , hideously . He jumps back as if bitten . It 's Janie 's face again , looking at him with concern . He gets up , saying , " I do n't feel good . Something I ate maybe .... " He keeps looking back at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't , there 's something about her expression - her love , her expectations , her wanting him to be Someone - that fills him with horror . What 's happening to me ? he asks the world . His full-blown PTSD has started and he 's scared out of his wits . Why an insect ? Why would someone I love become an insect ? He 's walking the hallways of the dark house , wanting so much to watch that old footage again , but also not wanting to . The thought of it scares him . He falls asleep at last on the sofa , under the excellent taxidermy job that 's mounted on the wall above him : The giant locust 's head , the eyes , the antennae , the mandibles . Another trophy to heroism lost . His limbs are akimbo on the couch - like a child 's or a bum 's . The great eyes on the wall regard him stonily in the darkness . His eyes close . The next few weeks have this in store for Rick : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have more hallucinations , more flashbacks , find himself able to concentrate less and less , and both his job and marriage will crash . Janie 's father will ask him ( " for Janie 's sake , Rick " ) to seek out a man of the cloth - priest , rabbi , Lutheran minister , ayatollah , Tibetan monk - " I really do n't care who , son . The problems of the soul are universal .... " Rick will see a billboard on his way to work - THE REVEREND FIRESTONE HAS ANSWERS-MAYBE HE HAS YOURS - and it will remind him of McCulloughville , the church he went to as a child . He will indeed seek Reverend Firestone 's counsel - only to find himself in a modern-day revival tent , the Reverend screaming about the End Days , the Seven Plagues , one of them locusts . Rick will Jeave in a daze , one hundred dollars poorer and his soul no better off . The best book deal his agent can get will be a print-on-demand publisher who wants a pre-order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . The movie based on his exploits will go into production suddenly and recklessly at the hands of an aging director and two leads with the acting ability of convenience-store clerks . In a wonderfully hideous sequence Rick will get to watch the project implode before his very eyes as the actor playing him ( an overweight thirty-five-year-old ) gropes the actress playing Janie ( a brunette floozie ) and the locust - with creature effects from the Muppets studios - collapses on them both . Lawsuit epithets flying , everyone leaves for lunch , and Rick is left standing alone on the set . By this point Janie will be finding him less and less the hero she thought she 'd married and will be unable to hide her frustration . Professor Price , his patience at an end and concern for his daughter mounting , will come down on Rick like a hammer . The inevitable occurs and Janie asks for a divorce : She has found someone else - a policeman , a wonderful guy straight from the " 50s who has recently received a city heroism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their seven pets from a trailer fire started by a Little Mermaid nightlight . The policeman , Frank Emerson , has a steady job , solid values , and , like Janie , wants progeny . Rick loses his job at the laboratory , moves out on his own , and when he sneaks back into the house one night to retrieve his precious footage - his memories , his glory , the only thing he 's got now - he triggers the new My Safe Castle Security system Frank Emerson has installed for his fiance . The police - all Emerson 's friends - converge on the house , handcuff Rick , and start talking heartily about the barbecue next weekend that Janie and Frank are hosting . Emerson - with what looks like sincere compassion ( after all , he is a wonderful guy ) - puts his arm around the handcuffed Rick and says : " You need help , Rick - the professional kind . " Rick takes the advice . Goes to a shrink - a big red-haired woman who 's as narcissistic as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : He 's got a roaring Delayed Stress Syndrome . What to do about it ? Three things , Mr. Rowe : ( 1 ) Join a veteran 's outreach group , where you 'll find people you can relate to and work through the problem with . While you 're doing that , ( 2 ) offer your services to the community - schools , YMCAs , museums . Every community needs a hero . And ( 3 ) get a job that 's got some adrenaline to it , a thrill , one where you can feel that old Being Important rush - " getting back on the horse , " as they say . She adds : " But get a haircut first , Mr. Rowe . And a shave . You look like a bum . " And we cut to : He 's gotten the haircut and the shave . He 's talking to an elementary school class . He 's got his news footage with him and he 's showing it to the kids , while the teacher stands in the back , hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One kid has a " Barbie Warrior Princess " doll ; another , a full-monty " Malibu Ken " with cute " Partner Brian " ; and another , a radio-controlled " Homeland security Force " action figure whose gender is impossible to determine . They 're not impressed . News video , after all , is news video . They 've seen everything on TV . When the footage ends , he stands up in front of the class and a little girl says : " Why did you have to kill them , Mr. Rowe ? Animals are important . They 're how Mother Nature tells us she loves us , are n't they , Mrs. Spring ? " " We 've been discussing endangered species , Mr. Rowe , " the teacher explains , while a boy says shrilly : " They were one of a kind , Mr. Rowe . They were endangered and you killed them . Why ? Why ? " The teacher 's face becomes a locust . The kids become little locusts . The sound of insect legs rubbing together builds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We hear the little girl saying , " I 'm glad he 's not my daddy , " as we dissolve to : A gigantic insect face being painted on the side of what we assume is an airplane fuselage - the way cartoon versions of tanks , planes , and/or blonde pinups were painted on the sides of WWII aircraft . We pull back to see that it 's really a Ford E Series commercial van-ZIPLOCK EXTERMINATORS in block letters on its side and two crudely constructed wire insect antennae on its roof - and it 's Rick painting carefully but badly the face of an oversized cockroach . He 's painted other insects , too , on its side all rendered terribly - things that look like pregnant ants and headless termites . It 's his new job and he 's being as " heroic " as he can be . We go with him to the next house on his list and the experience is brief and chilling : A pickup-on-the-dead-lawn stucco tract home with screaming children and a screaming man and woman and there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rug move . He blinks , squints , and , yes , it is cockroaches . There 's more insect life here than he ever saw in the Professor 's lab . He stands frozen until the kids , sticky from too many soft drinks and unbathed body parts , are swarming around him , pulling him toward the squirming carpet . Minutes later he 's spraying the house - the carpet , the sofa , the walls , the kids . In rapid montage we go through his workday with him - termites , grease-eating ants , boring beetles , mice so filthy they look like insects . Then a final shot of Rick painting a crude Charlie Brown on the side of his van - X 's for eyes - and we fade to : Rick is at a community center that evening , making his first session of the veteran 's outreach group . He could n't be more fish out of water . These vets , not your average , are either enormous guys in denim overalls without shirts , birds of prey and women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Sort Them Out tattooed on every inch of them , or little wiry men with haunted eyes who look like serial killers . They talk about " the horrors of the Nam " and the " the gasses of the Gulf " and " the caves of Afghanistan " and Rick , a young Tom Hanks expression on his face , feels like running for his life . But it 's his turn now to speak , to share the horror , and all eyes are on him . They 're waiting for him - aging boomers , bearded bikers , wiry paranoids - to speak . When he does , he ca n't help it . He blurts out : " It was n't horrible for me . I loved it . " His eyes are tearing . " Actually , I want it back . I miss it . " Suddenly everyone is crying . They 're up , out of their seats , huddled around him , all of them crying . Their great tattooed arms and their dark skinny arms are around him , suffocating him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We know what you mean , Rick . We miss it , too . " When the meeting ends , Rick slips away , makes his way down the night street ( his car has of course broken an axle ) , and hears someone coming after him . It 's Chi Chi Escalante , one of those gaunt-eyed wiry paranoids from the group . Worse , he 's Hispanic - something no all-American red-blooded boy from McCulloughville can possibly trust . Chi Chi 's got a scar on his cheek and to make matters worse he 's grinning : He wants to be friends . " How about a flick ? " he says and Rick mumbles , keeps walking . Chi Chi persists . He knows a bro when he sees one . " You 're that guy who whacked those bugs , right ? " Rick 's vanity sparks . He stops walking . " Must have been excellent , " Chi Chi says . " Yes , I suppose it was , " Rick answers . They walk , they talk . " How about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Rick thinks . He does n't even have a DVD player anymore . He ca n't even watch the old footage . Chi Chi driving , they go to a dark downtown movie theater - sticky floors , creepy customers , high ceiling with gargoyles glaring down - and it 's a Mexican horror movie , one about a human brain kept alive on a catering cart . It 's in Spanish , no subtitles , and Chi Chi says : " Man , I grew up on this basura . " Rick stares . Strangely , he can relate . The hero is n't even Anglo ; in fact , he 's not sure there is a hero ; but for a moment he can imagine Chi Chi growing up on it and loving it . But then the food - he hopes it 's food - that 's holding his shoes to the floor destroys the magic moment and he 's got to leave . " How about a bubbly ? " Chi Chi asks . " I know this part of town like my girlfriend 's chi-chis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes home , where he finds that Frank Emerson has - wonderful guy that he is broken into his apartment and left a pile of his belongings : Mounted locust head , trophies , awards , wedding pics , belts , socks , cell phone , and keys to a pair of jet skis whose location Rick has forgotten . And a note : " Thought you might want these . Frank . " The cell phone 's battery is dead , he does n't have a land line , and pay phones that work , he 's about to discover , are as rare as whooping cranes . When he finds one three hours later , he calls Chi Chi . " Yeah , I 'd like a drink , " he says . " I 'd like one very much , amigo . " They drink . In fact , Chi Chi gets him plastered at an East L.A. bar and before we know it they 're staggering out of a tattoo parlor on Hollywood Boulevard and Rick 's got , on his forearm , a rather large bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A hero 's got to have a tattoo ! " Rick announces shit-faced as we fade out and back in to : Another montage , even quicker , of the next workday - the van , Rick 's tattooed arm painting another species of vermin on the side of the van , the houses he visits , the very real world of people and their insects . When the montage stops this time , it 's in an old man 's vegetable garden ... the grasshoppers that are eating his corn and lettuce . We hold on Rick sitting cross-legged in the dirt , holding one of the little locusts as it kicks in his hand doing its best to live . The old man comes out , looks confused , then angry . Rick looks up with an expression like Christ 's : Suffer the little insects to come unto me . " I 'm sorry . I just ca n't do it , " he says , placing the creature gently back on a head of lettuce , gets up and leaves . We jump to : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't hear what they 're saying . His boss is pissed and he 's pointing at Rick 's van . Rick gets a can of turpentine and a rag and removes his artwork . When he 's through , he looks terrible . His hair has grown like hybrid grass . He 's got a beard . He does look like a bum . But he 's got a DVD player now and a high-end camera phone - thanks to Chi Chi , who 's got street connections up the wazoo . He does n't know how to work the camera , picture caller ID , Bluetoothr connectivity or much else , but who cares ? He calls Janie and leaves his number and that evening gets a call : They 've got vampire bats in Cleveland , the voice says - millions of them . They know who he is - he 's the only one who can stop these things - and they need him right now . The Mayor 's office , the National Guard , the Highway Patrol - they all need him . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's happening - finally happening . He can feel the adrenaline , the thrill , the joy , the glory - how important he 's going to be in the universe again - but then it starts : the laughter on the other end . It 's a joke , he realizes . They 're Frank 's friends . They 've got to be . He turns off the cell , feeling sick to his stomach . He watches the old footage . The mounted locust head , still lying in a corner of the room , stares up at him and his cell starts ringing again . He 's chosen a chirpy bird song for the ring and regrets it . He hesitates - but picks it up . He can hope , ca n't he ? This time the voice barely gets a sentence out before it cracks up . It 's giant chickens in Duluth this time , but the voice - enjoying itself , other voices in the background enjoying themselves , too - ca n't even get the next sentence out and Rick ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and haunting now . We see tears in his eyes . Rick and Chi Chi hang out . More drunkenness . Hitting on working girls , babes in singles bars , hotties with dates whose dates arrive late and surly . Rick falls on his face in a stupor before anything - good or bad - can happen . Close on his tattooed arm hanging in a gutter . The eagle looks more like a parrot . He keeps his cell off , but knows the messages will keep coming . Frank 's friends , friends of friends , anyone who wants a laugh . He stays away from his apartment as much as he can - even goes to more Mexican horror movies with Chi Chi - but in the end he still listens to the calls . When he 's not with Chi Chi he walks the streets alone . One night , bleary from drink , he sees a very attractive blonde being mugged by a street gang that 's so ethnically diverse it looks like a UNESCO poster . He 's never seen a mugging before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on and why God must have led him here : His chance to be a hero . He has righteousness on his side . The gang will sense this . But before Rick is halfway to her the young woman nails two of the gang with her purse . Her wig flies off and it 's not a young woman at all but a very ticked-off transvestite who 's swinging a bag that weighs more than a basset hound . He 's fast , hairy legs pumping as he disappears down an alley just as Rick arrives . The gang turns to face him . The gang 's feelings are hurt , it would seem . They 've been shamed and need to take their feelings out on somebody . The leader of the gang explains this to Rick rather cheerfully . The last shot we see is of a blue Dewey Dumpster in the alley , Rick 's head rising slowly out of it covered with ketchup , the insides of melons , and other produce almost but not quite hiding his black eye . We push in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halo around his head as we cut to : Rick , despondent , phoning Chi Chi from his dark apartment , only to hear this : " Message for Pablo and Dennis and Maria and Reek . Sorry , homies , but I ca n't take this civilian sheet no more . I re-upping today . " His best friend has reenlisted , for Christ 's sake . Rick looks down at the floor in the darkness . Bugs - hundreds of dark , featureless bugs - scuttle across the linoleum . Cut to : Rick heading home at last - to McCulloughville - on a seedy Greyhound bus . He ca n't take it anymore and it 's only in McCulloughville , he tells himself , that he 'll be able to put the terrible realities of 2005 America behind him . His bruises show . His black eye makes him look like a raccoon . His hair and beard seem to have grown at an inhuman rate . As he gets closer to home , the billboards get older , some of the products no longer made : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shave . Buick Roadmaster With Dynaflow . The cars passing the bus get older too and the clothing of those driving warp back to the " 5Os as well . Rick Rowe is going home at last . As the bus slides into the McCulloughville station , we see the town . It has n't changed . Rick may have saved it from the mutant locusts , but something else has saved it from the new millennium : It 's still the Small Town of The Blob , Them ! , and all those other " 5Os horror flicks , and it 's the only home Rick 's got . A little museum has been built to commemorate him and he goes there first . He remembers hearing about it . The docent at the door - an old lady who 's not quite sure where she is , or who - does n't recognize him , and what he finds inside is a shock . The two giant locusts that have been preserved , reassembled and put on display are covered with dust . The lighting in the place sucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tour . In fact , there is n't anyone in the museum except a pair of teenagers - a boy with slicked-back hair and a girl with a mohair sweater - necking behind the left hind leg of the locust occupying the darkest corner of the room . When they notice him , they laugh , he hears a word that sounds like " wino " and he realizes what he must look like . He ca n't let the town see him like this . As he leaves he sees a portrait of himself under a burnt-out bulb : Someone has drawn a mustache on his upper lip and antennae on his head .... He checks into the main hotel , signs in under " Smith , " and pays cash . Somehow it 's still ten dollars - just what it used to cost in the " 50s . He showers and shaves and as a haircut settles for removing the hair from the back of his neck with a razor . He puts on the one set of clothes he 's got in his bag , downs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , and in the mirror over the bar practices smiling . He ambles down the street and it 's McCulloughville all right , town of his childhood , site of his glory , and the smile is for real now . His eyes are wide and he 's happier than he 's been in a long time Until a couple passes him and the look they give him is deadly - as if he were diseased . Maybe they do n't recognize him . It 's a small town . Maybe they think he 's a stranger and There , across the street , is Buddy Blaylock , his best friend from McCulloughville High School . Rick moves toward him quickly , hand raised for the hello that 's about to come out of his mouth , and as Buddy Blaylock turns We see the same expression . Daggers . " Hello , Rick , " Buddy says . Rick is ebullient : " Gee , it 's great to see you , Buddy . Gee , you 're looking good . How 's Spooky . How 's the Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly . " How 's the big city , Rick ? Treatin " you well ? " " Yeah , I guess so , " Rick lies . " Glad to hear that because some of us had to stay here in McCulloughville after you left - to keep things going . Know what I mean ? " Rick does n't know what he means . Patty Rippey , Buddy 's girlfriend , comes out of the market and stops , the same look on her face . " Well , if it is n't The Rick Rowe . " " Yeah , if it is n't , " Buddy says . They 're looking at him like he 's a pedophile . " It 's been great , Rick , " Buddy says suddenly , " but I need to get back to work now . You know , work . What people do on weekdays . But you have fun now , hear ? " Rick is left standing in the street as the two drive away in Buddy 's blue-and-white " 56 Ford with tuck-and-roll . Rick walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pickup trucks working , men and women in stores working , secretaries in offices working , a covey of housewives shopping . It 's McCulloughville , all right , but it 's the real world now , a McCulloughville he does n't remember . Whatever happened ( he asks himself ) to the good old days of hotrodding and moonlight necking and Christmas trees where boys and girls opened their presents in their jammies and Dean Martin sang " White Christmas " - and everything else from a world where the aliens were aliens and you knew who you were ? It 's gone because you left it , Rick , a voice says ; the one that always talks this way , because you became a Hero and left . He walks on , finally finds himself before his parents " house . It looks the same . The lawn , the trees . The sunlight feels like the sunlight he remembers . He rings the doorbell , running his fingers through his hair . It 's Friday , the day his father often takes off from bank duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly will . Mr. and Mrs. Rowe are inseparable . The family - the three of them - were inseparable . His father answers it in his suit and stands there in the doorway . Rick can see a figure moving in the background and knows it 's his mother . " Come in , " his father says . That 's all . Just " Come in . " " Hello , Rick , " his mother says inside , and Rick blinks . It 's dark . He ca n't see anything in this sudden change of light . " Have a seat on the couch , " his father says . Rick goes toward his mother to hug her but ca n't see her , bumps into a table and when his vision clears he sees it : Her face . Her expression . " It 's good to see you , Rick , " she says , but it 's just a courtesy . She was always courteous to everyone . " Yes , son , it is , " his father echoes . " How is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be better , " Rick says - wondering whether he should tell them . " I 'm very sorry to hear that , " his father says , and silence follows . His father does n't ask what 's wrong . His mother is sitting in the big stuffed chair opposite the sofa , where Rick is sitting , and his father does n't sit down . " Is there anything we can do , son ? " one of them asks - he 's not sure which - but it 's only a courtesy . " How are you both ? " Rick asks . " I miss you , " he says . " We miss you too , " his mother says , robotic . Then his father says it : " We 've wondered about you and we 've worried , as parents do . We would n't have worried so much , son - especially your mother - if you 'd written to us or phoned us more .... " Rick ca n't believe it . He did call them , he wants to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd come to his wedding . They 'd seen the house . Maybe over the past few months , with everything so crazy , he 'd neglected to stay in touch - but that was because he 'd been embarrassed , because he did n't want to burden them with his troubles . He starts to explain all of this , to apologize , but the two of them - like cutouts , cardboard characters in some terrible " 50s Aliens-Among-Us movie - just stand there staring at him . " I came because I wanted to see you , " he 's saying , but they do n't answer . " I wanted to see if McCulloughville was the same . I wanted to let you know that I think about you constantly , even if things have been pretty crazy and I have n't had much chance to " Is that a tattoo on your arm , son ? " his father asks sternly . Rick gets up . He 's got to leave . His father says more gently : " There 's a twenty-five-dollar savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . If you need money , you could cash it . " No , " Rick tells him . " I 'd rather keep it here . You know , knowingit 's here ... in the house where I grew up .... " Then his mother says : " You look terrible , Rick . You would n't look so terrible if you got a haircut . " Rick is walking fast down the street , away from the house where he spent his childhood , turning once , despite himself , to wave at the two shadowy figures just inside the doorway . And then he 's free - free from this new horror - and we cut to : Rick returning to the Greyhound Bus , somewhere between McCulloughville , Year of Our Lord 1958 , and southern California , 2005 . And we fade to : Rick , at night , listening to his cell messages in the darkness of his apartment . If it 's dark , he does n't have to look at the bugs so much . There 's a message asking him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informing him that UFOs posing as convenience stores are kidnapping citizens in New Jersey . A call about radioactive prostitutes in Chicago and one about little red crabs that have invaded a town in Florida . Dissolve to : Rick , the next day , trying to find the veteran 's outreach group - but it 's moved and no one knows where . That evening , Rick 's cell has only one message : A man representing the mayor of Corkscrew , Florida , saying that he called yesterday and would appreciate it if Mr. Rowe would call him back . The man , very serious - somehow not laughing - keeps talking , and we hold on Rick 's eyes in the darkness - insect-like , faceted , despairing . " Do you have a fax or email , Mr. Rowe ? " the voice asks . We see the horrific nightmare he has that night - a perfect amalgam of everything he 's gone through over the past few weeks : Locusts , little kids spitting " tobacco , " Janie with thirteen children , his parents telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - you look like a bum . " And then : The sound of his cell chirping brings us out of the nightmare into the bleakness of his apartment . At least the insects have returned to the walls for the day . He struggles up , angry , ready to read the prankster the riot act if he can only get through the piles of dirty clothes and trophies to the cell in time . " Mr. Rowe ? " " Now you listen to me - " " I know it 's early , Mr. Rowe , but we have a problem down here - " " If I ever find out who you are you - " " The crabs are Gecaicoidea natalis , a non-native species introduced by accident twenty years ago , and we 're having a hard time containing them . We believe that you - given your experiences with Melanoplus spretus may be able to help us . We 'd be willing to pay your airfare and expenses - and a respectable consultant 's fee - if you 'll visit us for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you our hospitality .... " Rick stops . Something about the voice .... The man , the Floridian accent sounding real , keeps on talking and Rick finally gets it : It 's legit - there 's a REAL town with a REAL problem down there in Florida somewhere . And they want his help . MIDPOINT OR HOW THIS CALL WILL CHANGE RICK 'S LIFE Rick is looking a whole lot older now - thirty-three , not twenty-three - but he 's been through a lot recently . And he 's right : This phone call is going to be important , though not in the way he imagines . Rick takes the money the mayor of Corkscrew has wired him and flies to Florida , feeling his oats , full of hope . He 's met at the airport by one of Mayor Delameter 's staff and driven to his hotel , the old but clean and dry Swamp hotel in downtown Corkscrew . The next morning he 's out at the edge of town where Main Street runs along the Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary and he 's surveying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the size of your palm that are migrating , as they do each year - though not usually in such numbers - through the town back to the swamp to breed ... and taking their sweet time doing it . The mayor and his staff are present . The local press is present . And so is a woman , early thirties too , who does n't seem to fit this south Florida scene : She 's dressed somewhere between Banana Republic and L. L. Bean , attractive and confident but understated , and she stands off from the group with her arms crossed and an amusement on her face that he finds disturbing . No one bothers to introduce them , and Rick does n't ask who she is - though he ca n't ignore her . " Well , what do you think , Mr. Rowe ? " the Mayor asks . " What can we do about this little problem of ours ? We ca n't touch their breeding grounds in the swamp . They 're protected . " " What are their natural predators , Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't seem to have any , Mr. Rowe . Not enough to matter . " " That 's not possible , " Rick answers . " Every animal this size has - or once had or would have if you moved it somewhere else - a natural predator . That 's a basic scientific concept , Mayor . " The Mayor , his staff , the press and the other citizens present look at each other and shrug . No one looks at the woman in Birkenstocks . " Coons , " someone says at last . Rick freezes . " What ? " " Raccoons , Mr. Rowe , " the Mayor says . " Yeah , " someone else says , " I 've seen coons eat them . They 'll eat crayfish , frogs , even a hefty turtle if they can get into one . " " There 's your solution , Mayor , " Rick says . Everyone looks at everyone else again . They 're willing to believe . They just need encouragement . " How much does a raccoon cost ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you can probably get the Seminoles over at Pahokee to round up two hundred or three hundred of " em for five bucks a head . Take " em a couple of weeks maybe . They do n't have anything else to do . " " You 'll need more than that , " Rick says quickly . " And you 'll need them quicker . " " My sister 's brother , " someone else offers , " works for Water and Power in Baton Rouge . I 'll bet we could get a thousand in less than a week from the Cajuns . Cheaper , too . " The Mayor 's staff calculates and recalculates and at two thousand raccoons it 's going to cost the city somewhere between ten thousand and fifteen thousand dollars - transportation included - which is great . But suddenly someone is laughing and everyone turns . It 's the woman and she 's really enjoying it . " Mr. Rowe , " the Mayor says , and he 's not happy , " this is Dr. Field . Dr. Susan Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecologist trained at the Woods Hole Institute in Massachusetts who 's lived in Corkscrew for five years . She 's laughing , he also learns , because the introduction of that many raccoons to the area would not only put a hundred native birds , by egg theft , on the endangered species list , but would destroy the tropical fish farms upon which twenty percent of the economy of Corkscrew County depends . " Remember how the " walking catfish " hurt those farms in the early " 80s ? " she says . The crabs may be an annoyance , she adds , but they do n't impact the local economy at all the way two thousand bandit-eyed predators - would . Rick is devastated . All he can think to say is : " What do these crabs want7 . " " They seem , Mr. Rowe , " she tells him , while the mayor and his staff glare with hostility , " to want to get back to their swamp and breed .. . and we happen to be in the way . They also like hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parasites ? " Rick says , trying anything . " Crab parasites do n't distinguish between arthropods , " she says . " We 'd kill the crayfish and other crabs in the sanctuary . And you do n't kill crayfish in the South , Mr. Rowe . " " Topical pesticides ? " " Our good Mayor tried that once , " Susan Field answers , smiling at Delameter , " despite objections from a humble ecologist from New England , and the federal government hit us with a fine in the six-figure area . That 's not science , Mr. Rowe , but it is politics . " " I 'll need , " Rick mumbles feebly , " to think about it . I 'd like ... to spend tomorrow looking at whatever reports ... and other documents .. . you may have on the history of the problem , Mayor . " " Good idea , Mr. Rowe , " Susan Field says , still amused and very unwilling to let him off the hook . Why did he ever think this would work ? He flees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares at the wall , and when night falls makes his way to a bar just outside of town , cap pulled down to hide his face . Then these things happen : Susan Field tracks him down at the bar . It 's a very small town , word travels , and he 's the only one with an L.A. Lakers cap . She even shows compassion . Rick is n't yet drunk , but he 's certainly doing his best to drown his sorrows in Gator Piss Beer . She makes chat - telling him a little about herself , her graduate work in wetlands ecology , the politics of environmental issues in the South , safe things to talk about - and then she asks him about himself . He hides the truth , - more accurately , he lies . He tells her about all of the heroic things he 's done since McCulloughville . It 's easy when you 're drunk . Polar bear infestation in Inuit villages and how he used inflatable seal decoys filled with laughing gas to subdue them . A Nessie-like plesiosaur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreaking nocturnal havoc at two marinas , and how bagpipe music played on an old PA system helped him catch it .... She 's not easily fooled . She sees a man who 's in agony , and , though we wo n't know why until our story 's through , she invites him back to her house for the night . " I 've got an extra room , " she says . Rick brightens . An attractive woman inviting him back to her house for the night ? Maybe he 's still got that Hero magic . Maybe Janie was wrong . Maybe his science is n't so off . When they reach her house , an old Florida bungalow with endless verandahs , the bubble bursts and he discovers she 's got a ten-year-old son - Jacob - and it 's his room that Rick will share tonight . The room is a waking nightmare : It 's filled with insects . Insects mounted on pins , arranged neatly in drawers and glass cases , each with an information card . Insect mobiles hang from the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects sit on the dresser . Rick wants to scream . But the boy is entranced : This is Rick Rowe - the man who stopped the mutant Melanoplus in northern Nevada . The boy knows all of it , about Melanoplus , about Rick , and his eyes are wide with adoration . Rick should love this attention , but he does n't . He slips away to use the bathroom and as he does overhears Jacob whisper to his mother , " Do n't tell him , please , Mom . " She smiles . " I wo n't . Not unless you want me to . " Susan retires to her bedroom early ( " I 'm an early riser - you two have fun " ) as the wimpy , chunky , bespectacled Jacob bombards him with questions and takes him on a tour of every species in the room . The tour lasts late into the night . Lying on the bottom bunk at last - Jacob 's heavy body asleep just above him - Rick , not surprisingly , has nightmares about insects . Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , in fact . She insists , and the intensity of her insistence is a little scary . But he has no place else to go and there 's something real , something human in this little world with its bug-collecting ten-year-old , this female Ph.D . who teases Rick mercilessly but somehow affectionately , this town with its crab problem that seems not to be much of a problem after all . It feels , strangely , like home . He gets a job as a driver for a local water-bottle company and he learns who this woman really is . How Susan Field , still a graduate student at Woods Hole , came to study the ecosystem of the Corkscrew Swamp , wore her bug-proofed Birken stocks and Baffin swamp boots dutifully , and on her very first day in town met Joshua Covington - liberal politician born somewhere in Florida ( so he said ) , relocated here just before she arrived , ten years her senior , divorced , one son . How ( though she 'd never imagined herself a stepmother ) she 'd stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ways to save the swamp . How Joshua Covington died in an auto accident three years later , how she was the only one Jacob had left , and how soon after , the chubby boy , who obviously loved her , took up bug-collecting . As she tells him these things , she wo n't look at Rick and he does n't know why . Her eyes shift away as if she does n't want him looking at them . He hears something in her voice , too , that makes him think she might be lying . But about what ? Her life is obviously what she says it is , and she seems honest . What would she lie about ? As he works beside her in her home office , Rick learns what the new millennium is really about - not the stopping of alien blobs with fire extinguishers or giant locusts with food pheromones , but politics . He learns that the Mayor , going on his fifth term of office and always reelection-conscious - wants the little red suckers with pinchers stopped because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They 're not a physical threat to the citizens or an economic burden on the county . They 're a natural phenomenon and after each yearly migration their little red exoskeletons lie fading in the sun , crushed by car tires , toyed with by curious pets , even turned into godawful tourist souvenirs by local craftsmen . But they 're an embarrassment to the businessmen of the town , the ones who live in the big colonial homes , - and because they are , the mayor wants them stopped . And , Susan explains , Mayor Delameter is not going to listen to a Northerner - some female Yankee doctor of " bah-ah-logee " from Massachusetts , widow of a " leftist reformer " - about how to do that . The situation is hopeless , she says . Rick turns moody , homesick for something he ca n't even articulate , and Susan takes him to a " 5Os sci-fi horror film series at the local Corkscrew theater - a theater straight from The Blob . She makes fun of the movies : Their portrayal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cardboard people . He begins to see these things in a new light . These are n't movies about real people . They 're about cartoon characters who never lived and never could live in a real world . She teases him about his tattoo , too , but behind the teasing there 's that affection , and so he listens . Jacob gets sick a lot - the " flu , " she tells him , and Rick does n't think much about it . The boy does n't get much exercise , is chubby , so it is n't surprising . He 's just not in shape . He likes the kid , sure , but there are limits - and when the boy has the flu it gives Rick a legitimate excuse to bow out , to have time to himself . After all , when he is n't sick , the boy follows him everywhere , pumping him for information . One day he gifts Rick his one and only plastic replica of the " McCulloughville Mutants . " " I did n't even know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jacob says . " They had a computer game too . McCulloughville ! Every time you killed a mutant you got to street-race this old car . I had a copy but I loaned it to a guy at school and he moved . It was n't very good . The locusts looked like chickens . " Rick watches the Mayor 's commandos attempt to address The Crab Problem - flamethrowers , traps , poison . The burning crabs stink to high heaven and the live ones simply carry the traps off in a tidal wave of red bodies . It 's pathetic , Rick sees . Like a parody of those " 5Os creature-features , in fact . When Susan 's cat , DNA , crawls into the shower stall to die and Susan cries - saying , " They 're using the poison again " - it loses all humor . One night Rick stands in the darkness of the porch and watches the crabs marching through the creek near the house . They 're marching because they must , he realizes . They 're full of courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of courage and will ? he wonders . He takes Jacob - just the boy this time - to a " 5Os flick at last and finds himself poking fun at the Hero and The Girlfriend and The Professor and the State Police and how easy it all is . " If life were n't worth living , it would n't be so hard , " he hears himself saying , amazed . As he sits there in the theater with Jacob Covington , we know he 's discovering what it means to care about someone - someone who needs you and does n't have the power you do . It feels good . It even makes him feel - in a calm , quiet way - like a hero . The boy loves him . The boy falls asleep - that big goofy moon face with glasses - on his arm during their third movie in a row and Rick does n't wake him , even when Rick 's arm falls asleep . When the lights come on , Rick sees a rash on Jacob 's arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Susan when they get home . But as they leave the theater and he looks at Jacob 's arms again , the rash is gone . Was it just the lighting in the theater ? As they walk down Main Street , checking out the shops , they stop to buy T-shirts . Rick buys the boy one with a bug on it - a big , bright beetle . It feels good to do it . Jacob buys him a T-shirt with a bug on it , too - a giant millipede - and Rick must wear it . They wear their shirts together as they walk down the street . Though it 's embarrassing at first , it grows on him . At least it 's not McCulloughville Mutants . One night he finds a photograph of Joshua Covington and studies it , looks in at Jacob sleeping in his bed , and sighs . Fathers . Sons . Rick could have moved out of Jacob 's room by now - onto the porch that Susan has recently had enclosed - but he does n't . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and mentions it to Susan . " It 's all right , " she says . " It comes and goes . It 's not contagious . " And we cut to : Rick destroying his news footage tapes - the tapes of his old glory . He 's got a smile on his face . Acceptance at last . Some peace . And then it happens : They 're all watching television in the living room - fireplace , everything - in Susan 's house . It 's been a busy day on the water-bottle route and another two hours - Susan and Rick together - at the office of the " Save the Swamp " club , which Susan helped found . A news bulletin interrupts the regular broadcast : " They 're coming out of the sea at Galveston ! " the announcer shouts . What are ? The aliens , of course . Looking like aquatic triceratops with rubber horns , they 're swarming from the Gulf of Mexico and bringing the wrecks of old boats and airplanes , the detritus of the Bermuda Triangle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Global wanning and the gulf currents have cracked their stealthy underwater domes and they 're pissed , ready to tangle . Shots of fleeing Galvestonites . Shots of dripping creatures the size and color of Ml tanks . And it 's all real . Rick listens - and to his horror feels elation . It 's happening again , a voice says . A chance for that old glory . He resists . Has n't he learned anything at all from the past few months - from Susan , Jacob , and her world ? He 's one man , one human being - a mortal one at that - and there 's a world for him here in Corkscrew . A home . A family . Vanity rears its head like a cobra , but he resists . " Great , " he says at last , grinning . " The aliens are ruining the beaches in Texas . So what ? " Susan and Jacob laugh , but it 's a nervous laugh and Rick does n't know why . He notices Susan 's elbow . The light 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red rash . Is he imagining things ? Is this some mental trick - some odd residue of his PTSD ? " You do n't have that rash , too , do you ? " he says to her before they turn the lights out . " No , " she says quickly , and she 's right . When he looks at her elbow , the rash is gone . The next day the first fax arrives on Susan 's home machine : " Mr. Rowe , we need you . " Signed : The Mayor of Galveston . And another the next day - from the Office of Emergency Services in Texas : " You 're needed ! " And cell messages , real ones : One from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . One from the Miami HeTaid : " Word is that you 've been approached about the Galveston crisis . What are your plans , Mr. Rowe ? " Cell in hand , Rick folds . He stands before Susan . " They need me , " he says . " They really do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a railroad track . It 's McCulloughville all over again and he 's got to live his story . He 's got to . Certainly she 'll understand . " A man 's got to do what he 's got to do , " he says . Someone once said that . Someone in a movie , he 's sure . " It 's not real , " she says . " Of course it 's real , Susan . It would n't be on the news if it was n't real - " " I do n't mean it like that . " " Then how do you mean it ? " When she does n't answer , he says : " I was hoping you 'd understand . " He 's angry . If she really cared for him , she 'd understand , would n't she ? " Maybe we need you , " she says quietly . " Come with me - both of you , " he says - brightening . " We ca n't , Rick . It 's not our story . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's got to take his temperature every hour on the hour . Doctor 's orders . Finally , he says : " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't worry . " She 's looking away , as always , but making it easy for him . " I 'll explain to Jacob what 's happened . He 'll understand . You 'll still be his hero . " Rick takes the old Ford pickup that 's been languishing in Susan 's garage for years and speeds toward Galveston . You 'd think he 'd be on a freeway at least , but he 's not - it 's a highway like Route 66 and the billboards have the old brand names and slogans again - " see the USA in your Chevrolet " and " No CloserCall ... Than Burma Shave " - and the few cars that pass him in the night are just as old as his . The broken line down the center of the road mesmerizes him and his life flashes before his eyes . We see what he sees : McCulloughville , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob , Chi Chi Escalante . We see all of the versions of Rick Rowe we 've seen over the past few months . Something 's happening to Rick as he drives . We 're not sure what , but it 's important . Finally he sees himself as a locust - alien , wide-eyed , exoskeleton shimmering blue and green ... and somehow it 's all right . He stops the car , pulls a U , and drives back . When he arrives at the house , the doctor is there . Rick looks at the boy , the doctor , Susan , and knows suddenly that it has n't been the " flu " all these months . " How long has he had this ? " he asks her . " Since we arrived . " He does n't know what she means . Arrived ? " What is it - what does he have ? " Ricks asks . " A muscle weakness . A problem with the muscle sheaths .... I do n't know the scientific name . I 'm not sure there even is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it . " " Should n't he be at a hospital - with specialists ? " " That 's not possible . " " You mean money ? " She ignores him , looking at Jacob and the doctor instead , and all Rick can think to say is , " Will it get worse ? " She smiles a little , looking at him for a moment , and he realizes he loves that smile . It 's a little off , a little higher on one side , and her teeth are awfully small , but he loves it . " Maybe ... maybe not . " She says it with resignation and he remembers that she always says that : Maybe , maybe not . No assurances . No billboard-large promises . " He idolizes you , " she says quietly . " He does n't really know me . " " He knows what he needs to know , " she says . There 's an awkward silence between them as the doctor finishes his checkup on the sleeping boy . Rick notices the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them that Jacob 's arms had in the theater , that Susan 's elbow had . He stares . The rash remains . It 's real , he sees . Very real . He starts to say something about it , but the doctor looks up at him and there 's something odd about his eyes - the doctor wo n't look at him either - so Rick says instead : " There 'll be other aliens , other monsters , right ? " " Of course , " she answers . " There always are .... " She 's seen Rick 's look and knows it 's time . It 's time to tell him . She holds out her hands , and there it is , the rash - but as he looks the red turns blue and green , shining like a rain-forest butterfly wing , and it 's her skin , he realizes , not a rash . And when he looks up at her face , her eyes are n't what he remembered at all . They 're an incredible blue - like space between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her teeth look a little more pointed than he remembered them . It 's real , he knows . Sometimes what you want , she 's saying , though her mouth is n't moving , is n't very far away . He touches her hands and they 're thinner than he remembers , and maybe there 's an extra finger . It 's the atmosphere of your planet , she says , that 's making him sick . But he wants to be here . I 'm all he 's got . We 're all we 've got . Weneedyou , Rick , she 's saying . Weknewyou were the one when we saw you on television that day . So brave . Weknewyou would n't be afraid - that you of all people would be willing to help .... He 's staring at her , unable to speak . Even if he could , what would he say ? I was the one , she adds , who got the mayor to call you . He 's not one of us . There are only five . Jacob 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . I 'm sorry . He 's holding her hands now and , though her skin should bother him , it does n't . She 's still the woman he knows , even if she 's something else . He nods . She steps toward him , puts her arms around him , her pupilless eyes only a few inches from his , and hugs him , really hugs him . It feels good . He knows what they must be feeling - Susan , Jacob , the doctor and the others - alone here , not knowing what 's going to happen to them , bodies not really all that different from his . After all , we come from the same galactic seed , do n't we ? a voice says - the one that always talks like this . " I 'm glad you did n't go , " she says in his ear , this time with words , and he 's hugging her back now - a real , honest-to-goodness hug between two beings who 've become good friends and who may yet , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we see a tattoo on her forearm - a very patriotic eagle clutching arrows - something that was n't there a few days ago , something she 's put there for him , and this tells us that whatever else she might be feeling , whatever else she might be , she loves him - and is n't that what really matters in a universe or a movie like this one ? We fade to blue sky . Or stars . Or a newborn baby . Or whatever else feels right .
