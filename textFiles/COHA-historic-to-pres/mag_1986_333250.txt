To Nancy Reagan , the 1960s were a dark and undisciplined time that devastated our young people and spawned a drug culture . Hollywood , once her spiritual home , often failed in its responsibilities to the young and the nation . Now she and her husband are destined to work and plead and pray harder in the next two years than they did in their first six . <P> The autumn sun lights on her shoulders as she sits in her White House drawing room , a red-dressed dot of flame that by some alchemy has ignited the nation against drugs . As First Lady , she could have eased up , turned away into antiques or gardening . " But you could n't , you could n't , you just could n't , " she says with the fervor of a healer that no one ever imagined dwelled in that 100-lb. frame so elegantly clothed and coiffed . " When you talk to those kids and you talk to those parents who are just torn apart , what it does to these families , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice cracks just a bit , tears come to her eyes , and she apologizes . She is no Eleanor Roosevelt in health shoes , no Lady Bird Johnson rafting down the Rio Grande or Rosalynn Carter with a briefcase , ready to parley . She is so delicate that she seems to bend with each breath . To her critics , she is the most infuriating , contradictory and perplexing person in this Administration . Yet she could emerge as one of the most notable First Ladies in history . <P> Her six-year battle against drugs has carried her more than 100,000 miles , through 29 states and 57 cities . She has given 49 speeches and 125 media interviews . She has summoned 17 other First Ladies from around the world to the White House and signed them on to her crusade . This from " Queen Nancy , " this from the darling of the couturiers ? Whispers in Washington still have it that the drug issue was forced on her by the political handlers . In fact , advisers like Mike Deaver and Sheila Tate argued against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , it was a downer , " admits Mrs. Reagan . " They did n't want me to get into it . " But get into it she did , and even though the press itself is now fretting that it might have gone overboard in its breathless chronicling of the war on drugs , she is holding firm in her conviction that this is a national tragedy . <P> She remembers when the crusade was still only a platoon foray and full of peril . " Three hours I spent there , " she says of one lonely outing . " And the kids would be crying and the parents would be crying and I was crying . And at the end of it I remember the young person who was conducting said , ' Well , I 'm sure , Mrs. Reagan , you 'd like to get up and say a few words . ' Well , I was so teary and drained , I thought , ' Good night , how am I ever going to get up and say anything ? ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , it just went from there . "
