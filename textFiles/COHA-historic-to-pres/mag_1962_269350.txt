Vice President Lyndon Johnson grasped the worn ivory ball that serves him as a gavel , rapped smartly , and declared : " Two-thirds of the Senators present and voting having voted in the affirmative , the sense of the Senate is that debate shall be brought to a close . " <P> That was the announcement of a historic action : the U.S. Senate , which prides itself as the earth 's last bastion of unlimited debate , had just imposed cloture on a small band of filibustering liberal Democrats . For seven days the filibusterers had tied up the Senate by fighting an Administration bill that would turn over communications satellites to a corporation owned half by the public and half by private companies . Led by Oregon 's splenetic Wayne Morse , they charged that the measure was a " giveaway " by Government , principally to the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co . Ironically , the liberals used the same tactics for which they had long denounced Southern Senators fighting civil rights legislation . <P> <P> Back to Caesar . The cloture vote came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative filibuster back to ancient Rome , where an eloquent praetor named Julius Caesar tried ( unsuccessfully ) to talk to death a measure ordering the execution of Catiline 's coconspirators . <P> Until 1917 the U.S. Senate did not have a clear-cut rule to limit debate . That year eleven Senators filibustered against President Woodrow Wilson 's proposal to arm merchant ships , precipitating a famed presidential denunciation : " A little group of willful men , representing no opinion but their own , have rendered the great Government of the United States helpless and contemptible . " Under Wilson 's angry urging , the Senate adopted Rule XXII , which provided that cloture could be invoked by two-thirds of the Senators present and voting . <P> Still the Senators droned on and on . <P> Eleven times cloture votes have been taken against Southerners filibustering against civil rights ; eleven times the votes have failed . Until last week , cloture had not been imposed since 1927 , when Drys gagged a filibuster by Wets against a bill to beef up Prohibition enforcement . <P> Just Stay Away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Mansfield . Nearing the end of a frustrating Senate session , and smarting under charges that his mild-mannered methods were at fault , Mansfield finally began to act like a Senate leader . White House aides were ready to get into the fight , but Mansfield , fearing that they would only irritate the Senators , asked them to stay clear . Then , with the help of Oklahoma 's Robert Kerr , Mansfield went to work . <P> His problem was plain to see . The key to imposing cloture lay with Southern Senators-most of them dead set against the filibustering liberals but , by tradition and principle , violently opposed to cloture . First , Mansfield tried to persuade Georgia 's Richard Russell to vote for cloture . Said Russell : " I 'll vote to gag the Senate when shrimps start to whistle Dixie . " In the vote , Russell cast a resounding " no . " But significantly , he did not try to influence his Southern Senate followers .                @ @ @ @ @
