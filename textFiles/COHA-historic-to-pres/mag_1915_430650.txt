WHEN the war began , the cry in England was " Business as usual . " It was not long , it may well be believed , before the difficulties of such a program were discovered . But the visitor to London a year later is astonished to find how accurately a part of that phrase seems to describe the metropolis . It looks like London " as usual . " And yet There are two places above all where one must look for the signs and effects of war ? within what the French call " la zone des Armees , " and in the hearts of the people . Now London is far from the scene of battle ; not so far in miles perhaps , for scarcely a hundred and fifty separate London and Ypres , but immeasurably far in actuality , for the Channel and the British fleet lie between . And the Englishman does not wear his heart upon his sleeve . But even so the usualness of London takes the alien visitor ? one soon gets used to being an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " alien enemy " ? by surprize . NEW SIGHTS IN THE OLD CROWDS The streets have the familiar throngs . One still crosses them only at the price of eternal vigilance , for the charging phalanxes of towering motor busses and the darting swarms of taxis are all ? or nearly all ? there . The restaurants are well patronized ; at the Savoy or the Piccadilly Grill or the Rendezvous in Soho or Simpson 's it is not always easy to find a table at the popular hours . Even the theaters have comfortable audiences . Some are more numerous than others , but that is a condition not unknown in the piping times of peace , and a critical examination suggests that the quality of the play and the acting offers sufficient explanation . The old monuments still look down in grave imperturbability ? the Abbey , the Tower , St. Paul 's , the British Museum , the Temple , the building in Whitehall from which King Charles stepped debonair to a tragic end . To the casual eye it is the same old London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more exact . It was during the bitterly-fought election following the revolutionary act of the House of Lords in throwing out the Lloyd George budget , which sounded the first note of the Gilded Chamber 's requiem . Then every hoarding was parti-colored with posters ; so are they now . Then the Square beneath my window was filled daily with watching crowds ; so is it now . And yet ? there are differences , not great , each by itself , but in sum significant . The streets are full , but there is a new note in the crowd . It is the note of khaki . Soldiers , soldiers , soldiers . On the streets , in the taxis , on the busses , in the restaurants , the music halls , the theaters . No matter where you go , you see hundreds of them in an hour , thousands of them in a day . This is but the fringe of an army , a fraction released for a moment on leave . What an army it must be ! It is yet an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh uniforms were never in the trenches . These are not the faces of veterans . K. of K. must have many an army corps still to launch , when the time and the men are ripe , against that grim line of trenches in Flanders and northern France . There must be still oceans of good British blood ready to be spilled under burning skies to open the Turkish door for the great ally in the East . RECHRISTENING OLD LANDMARKS The familiar landmarks are , the same , but they , too , have a difference . The building before which King Charles died contains a fine museum of relics and instruments and war . But now as one studies the graphic plan of the Battle of Waterloo , one is elbowed by a field gun " taken from the Germans " a hundred years since British and Germans fought side by side in Flanders . One passes an accustomed arched gateway . But it 's strange looking now , crowned by a wooden house fitted with great searchlights . The Tower stands stern as ever , a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . It was only yesterday , they say , a spy paid there the price of his treacherous patriotism . The Museum broods still on books and wisdom , old times and sages past . Not far away the other night dropt from the sky a deadly missile . It was only chance the Elgin marbles and the Rosetta stone did not go then to join the library of Louvain . By a broad boulevard a stone monument , merely picturesque till now , shows a slim gun fenced in by a wooden parapet and rakishly pointing athwart the sky . The theaters go on as usual . Or not quite so . A last act , tragic in itself , when punctuated by the boom of bursting bombs and the sharp smack of shrapnel loaded shells , is quite unusual enough . It is no wonder the audience grows restive , some women whose nerves are not quite British enough take their escorts home , and the rest of us find ourselves listening with a divided mind . " The War in the Air " would make a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the stage before us but outdoors above our heads , it 's not the same thing at all . THE NEW LONDON TWILIGHT So there 's life in London even at night , but when dusk falls it 's a dusky city indeed . Half the street lights are out , the rest are hooded so that not a ray shines above the horizontal , the windows of hotels and houses are shrouded , the city moves in a lugubrious twilight . It is depressing at first , but the eye soon becomes wonted to it , the mind forgets that there ever was a Great White Way , and one goes on living almost as usual . By day the hoardings , the shop windows , and every available vacant space are bright with attractive posters just as they were four years ago . But then they bore attacks by Englishmen upon Englishmen and exhortations to half the country to smite the other half hip and thigh . They sought to array class against class , to enlist the patriotic men of England under the opposing banners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , class shoulder to shoulder with class , to fight an implacable fight against the common enemy . The unanimity of method then and now is interesting , the difference of tone and purpose not uninstructive . The Englishmen , like the loving couple in the fable , may use flat-iron and chair-leg against each other at home as much as they like , but they have no intention of presenting a divided front to the intruder from without . The crowds in the square . Like the posters , their purpose now , as then , is enlistment ; but enlistment not against a partizan opponent , but against a national danger . The cam- paign speakers are of various sorts ? here a Canadian non-corn. invalided back from the front and boasting already more than three thousand enlistments to the credit of his eloquence ; there a major , equally hors de combat for the present , and not quite so much at ease with his audience ; now the editor of a popular and rather sensational paper ; then a young woman who escaped when the " Lusitania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have varying success , but seldom does a meeting close without a few candidates for enlistment marched off to the medical officers for examination . K. of K. 's army is growing all the time , for these scenes are taking place all over the country , or at least the inevitable wastage is being continually made good . Three million men , they say , have already come forward , of their own free will and accord to fight the German menace . WORK FOR EVERYBODY So of the West End ; what of the rest ? In the East End , the home of the workers , the surprizing thing is not that there is so little change , but the direction in which the change has come . Materially speaking , times were never better . There is no unemployment , in this region where unemployment has been an almost chronic scourge . Every one has work except the incorrigible unemployables ; and they have been reduced to their lowest terms . In a side street one passes a row of sad-looking detrimentals sitting listlessly along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their kind for a night 's free lodging . But eighteen months ago there would have been a hundred of them ; today there is a bare dozen . Only the man who absolutely will not work is out of work now . The women are working , too . Here is a biscuit factory . Its main product now is a kind of glorified dog biscuit , hard and substantial , but not unpalatable and " werry fillip ' at the price . " Its destination is the trenches at the front , and one can easily imagine that it is vastly more welcome to Tommy in the intervals of trench warfare than more toothsome food would be . The factory is busy night and day ; and all day long dozens of women pack the hard squares in tins and deftly solder on the tops . They are women who have never worked before , outside the home . It is just because the home is not what it was before , with its men absent , that we find them here . It is not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The jam factory across the street has them as well ; and hundreds of others within a quarter of an hour 's walk ; and thousands of others all over the United Kingdom . When we reach the munitions factories themselves we shall find them busy even there , doing what they surely have never done before . The women of England are mobilized as well as the men . BETTER OFF IN WAR TIME What the the ultimate effect of this mobilization will be when the war is over is a nice economic problem , whose solution will be more accurately discovered in the event than in anticipation . Surely , however , any one who has learned from experience and observation to deprecate the increasing entrance of women into industry in times of peace can not but view the present tendency with anxiety . But the immediate effect is the one with which we are at the moment most concerned ; and that effect is a curious one . Many a household , perhaps it would not be too much to say the typical household , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than worse off because of it . The chief consumer of the family is away , his living being provided by the state . His wife 's separation allowance of twelve or fifteen shillings a week or even more if the family is larger comes in with gratifying regularity ; and the women of the household can find plenty of work if ' they only want it , to increase the family income . Incidentally the shillings which the workingman himself was not unaccustomed to spend on drink ? for the British workman , take him by and large , usually has a regular item for beer in his weekly budget ? are saved for other purposes . So the working class families of England are far from having a bad time of it just now . It should be added by way of disclaimer that this does not purport to be a serious economic study , but a collection of more or less fugitive observations gathered on the wing . My text is that London ? which if it is not England is a large section of it ? looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems fair to say , as usual only better . Nor am I taking into consideration for the moment the emotional side of the picture , materials for which are to be found in the grievous lists of casualties that come with sickening regularity from the front . Well over a third of a million has England lost in killed , wounded and missing in a twelve-month . The homes from which those thousands have gone can never be " as usual " again . There is one more place where London seems as usual , but different . Parliament met the other day after a six weeks ' holiday . It was certainly odd to see Mr. Asquith and Mr. Bonar Law sitting amicably side by side on the Treasury bench and putting their heads together for a quiet chuckle when a member opposite ? and not an ' Irishman either ? opens his mouth and puts his foot in it . Not once in a generation do the leader of His Majesty 's Government and the leader of " His Majesty 's Opposition " forsake for reasons of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back fence . It is a little comic and decidedly unusual also to see hailed as the leader of the Opposition a worthy gentleman who in times of peace was notable for leading only himself . ENGLAND WILL " MUDDLE THRU " So much for the differences brought about in this war time by the creation of a government of all the parties . The likeness to the House of Commons of everyday life begins to show itself as soon as the vext question of compulsory service drops lightly upon the table . The question is not yet in any way formally before the House , but the Commons has adroit little ways of opening a subject to discussion even under such circumstances , and the hue and cry is soon under way . It is hardly a moment before it is clear that the subject of conscription is really a party one and that the division on it in the Commons and presumably in the country is to be on party lines . It seems unfortunate that when the wise course has been adopted of forming a coalition government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy partizan differences should begin to creep in . And on such a subject as this , which , as the Englishman would probably paraphrase our American saying , " has cordite in it . " But the Englishman is an Englishman still ; and in priding himself on his national habit of " muddling thru " it sometimes almost seems as tho he considered it of equal importance to have the " muddle " and to get thru . And he is a very partizan person , who finds it very hard to give up even in times of danger and crisis his partizan antagonisms . One would feel better about this looming controversy over conscription if the suspicion were not present that both sides had their eye not So much on England 's present needs , as on England 's future policies . One can only hope , if one is England 's friend , that she will " muddle thru " ? " as usual . "
