PROVIDENCE <P> Directed by ALAIN RESNAIS <P> Screenplay by DAVID MERCER <P> At one point in this painfully self-conscious movie , Dirk Bogarde lifts an eyebrow to that magnificent height he alone of contemporary leading men can scale and declares his opposition to political violence on the grounds that it " reeks of spontaneity . " It is the only moment in the film that one feels comes from the hearts of Director Resnais and Writer Mercer , whose distrust of the spontaneous is woven into every tedious frame of this stupefying work . Calculation is their bag , and they have calculated the life right out of a conceit that clearly was not much to begin with . <P> Most of the movie takes place during one awful night in the sleepless imagination of a dying novelist ( played with fierce relish by John Gielgud ) . Trying to construct a final fiction , his mind keeps moving his son ( Bogarde ) , his son 's wife ( Ellen Burstyn ) , his bastard progeny ( David Warner ) and his own dead wife ( Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dear ones is , to say the least , misanthropic . They are cold , loveless creatures , incapable of responding to one another except by lobbing epigrams , Wildean in rhythm but not in wit , back and forth . <P> Finally , the night passes , and in a kind of coda the old gaffer 's kin arrive at his chateau to help him celebrate his birthday . One now sees the raw material he has been working with . If none of his family has genius , or even an excess of individuality , they all appear to be rather pleasant people , undeserving of the imaginary treatment they have received . The audience is left once again - and once too often-to speculate on the gap between reality and illusionary art , and on the widely alleged necessity for the artist to behave inhumanely . These gaseous themes have preoccupied the literary mind , determined to romanticize its own workings , too much in this century . Until now , thank heavens , the movies have avoided such blather . Perhaps this dismally attenuated movie will warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even served literature very well . If so , Resnais 's icily expert technique will not have been expended totally in vain .
