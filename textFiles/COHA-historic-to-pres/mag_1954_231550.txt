While the United Nations was carrying on diplomatic negotiations for the release of eleven U.S. fliers sentenced by Red China as spies ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the last Canadian war prisoner held by the Chinese Communists was free to shed gloomy light on how his fellow captives were faring in the so-called People 's Republic . Squadron Leader Andrew MacKenzie , 34 , who was released at the Hong Kong border Dec. 5 , told Ottawa newsmen that under stress of 16 months of solitary confinement he had been forced to sign a phony confession that he had flown his U.S. Air Force F-86 over Red China . MacKenzie also brought fresh news of four other U.S. fliers still held by the Reds . <P> MacKenzie , assigned to fly with the U.S. Air Force in Korea , was shot down over North Korea on Dec. 5 , 1952 , and taken to a jail in Mukden . There the Chinese held three U.S. fliers ( none of them listed among the eleven convicted airmen ) : Captain Harold Fischer of Swea City , Iowa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roland Parks of Omaha . MacKenzie said that he corresponded later with a fourth U.S. pilot , Colonel Edwin Heller of Philadelphia , who was in a Chinese hospital recovering from leg wounds . <P> Last March , after 16 months of solitary broken only by endless interrogations , MacKenzie numbly signed a completely false statement saying that he had been shot down while invading Chinese air space under orders . <P> After confessing , MacKenzie was permitted to take daily exercise with the three captured U.S. fliers . Although MacKenzie refused to say whether the U.S. prisoners had also been driven to sign confessions , he clearly implied that they had . Despite MacKenzie 's release , the outlook for his former U.S. comrades is still bleak . The Chinese told them that they would be held until U.S. policy toward Red China is " right , " MacKenzie said . " The Chinese are not too pleased about Formosa and not too pleased about the U.S. "
