At 1 a. m. one night last week the 1,650-ton Spanish Loyalist destroyer Jose Luis Diez got up steam , weighed anchor , laid down a smoke screen and left Admiralty Harbor , on the Atlantic side of Gibraltar . Scarcely had she moved from the British-protected waters before her crew saw rockets flare from a housetop on the Rock . No one needed to tell them what those flares meant : they were signals from Rebel watchers notifying Rebel warships patrolling the Straits of Gibraltar that the Jose Luis Diez , having waited for weeks to make her getaway , was trying a second time to run the blockade to a Loyalist port . <P> Instead of prudently turning back the Loyalist destroyer rounded Europa Point , Gibraltar 's southernmost tip . As she did so a Rebel cruiser hove into sight from the African shore . Six more Rebel warships , cruisers , destroyers , minelayers soon joined the chase . Guns from the 10,000-ton cruiser Carnarias , pride of the Rebel fleet , boomed . Batteries from Ceuta. in Rebel-held Spanish Morocco , some 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outclassed , nonetheless elected to fight . A shell struck the Jose Luis Diez 's forecastle , killed four men . One of her own guns exploded and killed more of her crew . <P> The 2,000-ton Rebel destroyer Jupiter nosed in between the Jose Luis Diez and the Gibraltar shore . Convinced now that the blockade could not be run . Commander Juan Castro changed his course , ordered the ship back to British waters . <P> Meanwhile , all Gibraltar had been aroused . Shells fell in the little village of Caleta , on the east side of the Rock , destroyed two houses , damaged a power plant , wounded four British subjects . General Sir Edmund Ironside , commander-in-chief of Gibraltar , sounded an alarm , called out the entire British garrison . The British destroyer Vanoc and a French destroyer , the Basque , went to investigate . Gibraltar 's guns fired blank shells to warn the Rebel warships that they were firing on British territory . <P> Desperate , the Jos Luis Diez deliberately rammed the Jupiter and disabled her . The Loyalist destroyer then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay . The Vanoc and Basque moved between the Jose Luis Diez and her Rebel attackers , played searchlights on the scene and began rescues in boats . The Loyalists ' battle toll was eight dead , eleven wounded . The dead were buried at sea from a British destroyer . A strong British guard was placed aboard the Jose Luis Diez after her Spanish crew was taken off and interned in military detention barracks in Gibraltar . Next day British tugs refloated the Loyalist destroyer and towed her back to Admiralty Harbor . <P> The Jos Luis Diez may herself be interned , but the difficulty in this procedure would be that the British , sticklers for international sea law , have no strict legal right to intern a Loyalist ship because : 1 ) they have not formally recognized the Spanish War as other than a civil conflict ; 2 ) they still recognize the Loyalists as the " friendly , " legal Government of Spain ; 3 ) they have not granted belligerent rights to Generalissimo Franco . Out weighing these objections , however , might easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diez to run for safety would again endanger British life &; limb at Gibraltar .
