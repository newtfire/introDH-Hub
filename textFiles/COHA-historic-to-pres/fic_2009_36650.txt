The first thing I remember about that morning was the dog . It was a mutt , a mangy mutt , and though my friend Danica would correct me and explain that mangy refers to mange , a skin disorder that did not afflict this particular dog , I stick by my description . It mixes alliteration and poetic license like a , well , like a mangy mutt . <p> Nothing else seemed amiss as I rolled into the caddie yard , and even a dog nosing at the door to the cart barn did n't qualify as something amiss . I knew the dog . His name was Duke , and he belonged to Rick Gilbert , the club 's head greenskeeper , who lived in a cottage surrounded by a thick wall of arborvitae at the far end of the parking lot . Duke was nasty in the way that small dogs often are . In the afternoons , he would burst through the arborvitae and snarl at any golfer whose ball landed too close to his territory . But in the mornings , Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric cart while his master inspected the golf course . Cute , Danica might say . She sees the good in every mutt , mangy or not . Me ? I 'm immune to cute . <p> It was the last Tuesday morning in June . The sun glowed a buttery yellow behind a gray deck of early morning clouds . A thin mist hung between the oaks and maples that lined the dewy fairways . An earthy smell filled the air , a mix of turf and cut grass laced with the tangy aroma of fertilizer . In the distance , a lawn mower buzzed . <p> Tuesday was Ladies Day , which meant that the fifty- odd members of the Ladies Golf Association soon would arrive to play in the weekly shotgun tournament . I would be long gone by then , heading off to play in the sectional qualifying round for the U.S. Open . I should n't have been here at all , except Charlie asked me to open the shop and pull out a couple of dozen electric carts from the barn . I refused initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me of his generosity in allowing me practice time . So here I was , working my day job when I should have been soaking my joints in a warm bath . <p> The cart barn , like the greenskeeper 's cottage , was a misnomer that evoked quaint but inaccurate images . The barn was n't a freestanding red barn with a silo and hayloft , but a long , architecturally bland garage attached to the pro shop . It was dank and dark , perpetually abuzz with electric chargers juicing hundreds of cart batteries . The front part of the barn was a new addition . It had cinder- block walls and a peaked roof and was big enough to hold twenty carts with flimsy fiberglass sunroofs attached to their frames . <p> The back part , the original barn , had plywood walls and a roof that sloped so low , I needed to duck . <p> Duke nosed along the bottom of the barn door , where a strip of rubber touched the blacktop . <p> " Hey , Duke , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly . I just did n't want to startle the mutt into nipping at my ankle . I jingled my keys for good measure . <p> Duke did n't react . He moved studiously along the bottom of the door , his nose leaving streaks of moisture on the rubber strip . Did a wet nose mean a dog was healthy or sick ? I did n't know . Duke 's breathing was loud and arrhythmic . A rasp here , a snort there . He reached the end of the door , whimpered , then sat back on his haunches and looked at me . <p> " What is it , boy ? " I said . " Lose something ? " <p> Danica must have been rubbing off on me . She spoke to dogs as if they were people , invested their every burp , twitch , and dumb expression with deep meaning . I felt ridiculous , not only asking Duke a question , but then staring into his rheumy eyes as if expecting an answer . <p> " Right , " I muttered . <p> Opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed the key into the lock and jiggled it with my right hand while twisting the door handle with my left . The handle resisted , gave a little , then resisted again before finally letting go . <p> " There , " I said , feeling the thrill of a minor triumph . The door was made of hinged wooden panels attached by tiny metal wheels to two grooved tracks . I usually yanked it up waist high , then adjusted my position to press it over my head like a weight lifter . Today , it stuck at about knee level , allowing Duke to scoot underneath . I wondered what he was up to , but not with any strong sense of curiosity . My real concern was lifting the door without pulling a muscle or pinching a nerve . The bottom right wheel stuck at a kink in the metal track . Someone , probably a caddie , must have rammed it with an electric cart . These accidents happened occasionally , and the usual remedy was a bang or two from a hammer . Duke snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door overhead . He was sniffing at something I could n't quite make out in the dim middle of the barn . I slapped at the light switch and nearly choked . <p> Duke was sniffing at his master . <p> Rick Gilbert hung between two carts in a space created by a third cart pulled out of line . The rope  --  a clothesline tied in a typical hangman 's noose  --  hooked over a rafter and angled down to another cart , where it was tied to the bumper . Rick wore his customary dark green overalls and pale yellow T-shirt . His head lay against his right shoulder , his tongue bulging thickly between his lips . His face was flushed , a deep red , almost purplish tinge bleeding through his dark tan . <p> Something between a groan and a cry escaped my lips and slowly faded into the background buzz of a single battery charger . The body suddenly started to rotate at the precise moment a seam opened in the clouds . Sunlight streamed into the yard and reflected an eerily milky glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flipped open my cell phone , and stabbed at 911 . <p> " Poningo Police . " <p> " I 'm at Harbor Terrace Country Club , " I said . " A man 's hanging in the cart barn . " <p> " Hanging ? " <p> " From a noose , " I said . <p> " Calm down , ma'am . What 's your exact location ? " <p> I described where the pro shop was in relation to the large stone castle club house that was a town landmark . <p> " Wait right there . A patrol car is on the way . " <p> I sat on one of the patio chairs and hugged myself as the dew chilled me through my golf shirt . In a split second , the pedestrian had changed into the surreal . I concentrated on the caddie yard : the metal rail embedded in three pillars of concrete where golfers leaned their bags ; the stand of lilacs shading the benches where the caddies waited for their loops ; the tin shack where Eddie- O kept the tee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . <p> Beyond the lilacs , a stretch of parking lot narrowed to a tree- lined maintenance road that ran down to the lower holes near the water . The arborvitae wall began at the mouth of the road and circled the cottage where Rick Gilbert lived with his family . His wife and son were in the cottage now , sleeping most likely , unaware that Rick was hanging in the cart barn . Dead . <p> A loud bang startled me . Down below , a truck jounced off the first fairway and pulled itself onto the paved path climbing toward the yard . I quickly got up and ran to the barn . Studiously averting my eyes from Rick , I dragged down the door as far as the kink in the track just as the truck lumbered past . The driver , one of the greens crew I knew by sight but not by name , waved . A greens mower rattled in the truck bed . <p> I turned back to the patio . A short man dressed in kitchen whites stood by the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seora Jenny , " he said . <p> " Hello , Reynaldo . " I hurried back to the chair . <p> Reynaldo worked in the club house restaurant . I often saw him early in the morning , walking up from the apartments attached to the back of the cart barn . <p> " Is everything okay ? " he said . <p> " Sure . Fine . No problem . " <p> " Do n't you take carts out ? " he said . He was short and neat , kind of handsome , really , with a bandito mustache that interfered with the pleasing combination of angles and planes that made up his face . He always waited our table at the Tuesday afternoon luncheon . The girls and I tipped him generously , more generously than the ser vice deserved , because we knew he sent every extra dollar back home to his family in Guatemala . <p> " I am . I will , " I said . " Just not now . " <p> " I help ? " <p> " No , Reynaldo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " His early morning routine was to haul in the bread delivery , fire up the ovens , and generally get the kitchen ready for the day . <p> In the distance , a siren wailed . Reynaldo shrugged , shoved his hands into his pockets , and headed up the hill . He reached the club house just as a patrol car rounded the circle and sped down . It stopped at the edge of the patio , its tires crunching a thin layer of sand spread on the blacktop . <p> The cop got out and ceremoniously fixed his hat on his head . He was tall and thin , with sharp features and a trimmed mustache . <p> " You call in the body ? " he said , his eyelids narrowed into a squint barely wide enough to admit light . " Yes , I . . . " He walked past me and slowly circled the yard , jiggling <p> the pro shop 's doorknob , rapping his knuckles on the side of the tin shack , peering behind the lilacs . He came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is it ? " he said . <p> He stood behind me as I lifted the barn door . I 'd left on the lights , so there was no mistaking what was inside . The body now faced away from the door . Duke sat below , staring up as if waiting for his master 's voice . <p> " Whose dog ? " said the cop . <p> " His , " I said . <p> The cop crouched near Duke and extended his hand , palm down . Duke sniffed the hand , then settled back into his vigil . The cop stood up , pushed his hat back on his head , and slowly walked around the body . He unclipped a tiny radio from his epaulet . Static crackled . <p> " Hennigsen , post twelve , over , " he said . <p> " Go ahead , twelve . " <p> " No mistake here . Got a hanger . Dead , too . Better send <p> Donahue . " " Ten four . " Hennigsen clipped the radio and turned toward me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ma'am ? " <p> " What you just said . You really did n't believe what I reported . " <p> " Well , ma'am , it 's been my experience that lots of reports coming from lay people are n't accurate . " <p> " What was so wrong about this one ? " I said . " I opened the door and found him . " <p> " I accept that , ma'am . " He spread his arms , shooing me back from the doorway . " You can tell your whole story to Detective Donahue . " <p> " How long will that take ? I have someplace I need to be . " <p> " It 'll take as long as Detective Donahue thinks it should take , ma'am . He 'll be here in a few minutes . Meanwhile , I need to secure the area . " <p> Excerpted from Where It Lies by K.J. Egan . Copyright 2009 by K.J. Egan . Published in May 2009 by St. Martin 's            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
