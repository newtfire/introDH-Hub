Some exhibitions might have been better as books , and " Berlinart 1961-1987 , " the Museum of Modern Art 's big summer show that closes Sept. 8 in New York City and reopens Oct. 22 in San Francisco , is one . Its senior curator , Kynaston McShine , took on a large subject , perhaps too large . The re-emergence of Berlin as a major center of the visual arts , after twelve years of Nazi darkness and a decade of limping postwar chaos , is not the only story of post- 1960s art , but it stays up there on the front page . Much against the odds of " internationalist " pieties , German artists in Berlin between 1950 and 1980 helped turn the geographical categories of art around , forcing the art world to lose not only its fixation on New York as late modernism 's only imperial center but also its set belief that abstract art was the ultimate style of the 20th century . <P> Out they come from the shadows cast by the Berlin Wall and the skyscrapers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what came to be known as heftige Malerei ( violent painting ) , the political artists , the conceptualists with chips on their shoulders . Some were raised in the divided city ; others had been drawn there by the Free University or , more generally , by the anarchic and utopian Bohemia of the ' 60s : the Fluxus group and its best-known member , Joseph Beuys , with his shaman 's wands and dead hares ; Eugen Schonebeck , with his images of mutants and cripples ; K.H. Hodicke , who made fervently swiped homages to Max Beckmann ; and Georg Baselitz , creator of clumsy , wistful figures stumbling about in an apocalyptic landscape . <P> Once again art was carrying the kind of meanings that abstraction could not convey , and these were picked up by a second generation of artists in the mid- 1970s , such as Rainer Fetting and Helmut Middendorf . By the mid-1980s the Neue Wilde , or new fauves , had become such a market bandwagon , so copious a fount of self-important rhetoric , that the rediscovered anguish of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Little Nell as one of those things one could not read about without laughing . <P> Nevertheless , there is a great deal more to Berlin art than the production of industrial-strength angst . The city 's rebirth as a major center of late modernism is now an accomplished fact . In this show  --  the first attempt by a U.S. museum at a conspectus of the subject  --  Curator McShine has done a good job of setting out , in samples rather than full packages ( 55 artists are represented ) , the peculiar mix of political intelligence , sharp irony , antic humor , mythic yearnings , brusque self-doubt and curiously facile pictorial effects that helped define Berlin 's cultural temper before Nazism and that came back , with many variations , after the ' 50s . <P> The protagonist can not fit on the walls . Berlin itself is the great metaphor , indeed the cause , of the lack of assurance and wholeness emitted by its postwar art . No city in northern Europe , except London , is more impacted with history ; at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragility of historical memory . You see a featureless tract of new buildings in an American city and merely sigh with boredom ; the same tract in Berlin is raised on the rubble and corpses of 1945  --  the new is also a tomb .
