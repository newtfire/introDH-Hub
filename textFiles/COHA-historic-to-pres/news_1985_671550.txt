In a historic decision that broadens the rights of spouses in divorce actions , the New York Court of Appeals ruled unanimously in Albany that a Yonkers woman who helped pay for her former husband ' s medical education was entitled to a share of the value of the license he subsequently received. // The ruling , a major test of the state ' s five-year-old equitable-distribution law , places New York in the small minority of states that have deemed professional licenses or degrees to be marital property , rather than the separate property of the holder. // The decision came in the case of Loretta and Michael O ' Brien , a Westchester County couple whose nine-and-a-half-year marriage ended in divorce in 1980 . During much of their marriage , including a three-and-a-half-year stint in Guadalajara , Mexico , Mrs. O ' Brien worked as a schoolteacher while Dr. O ' Brien was in medical training . In December 1980 , three months after he received his medical license , Dr. O ' Brien sued for divorce , then quickly remarried. // // ' Ecstatic ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now tutoring students privately in Westchester County , said she was " ecstatic " about the ruling . " It means that people can ' t use you and walk out on you whenever they feel like it , " she said . " I can ' t believe it , but justice has prevailed. " // But Dr. O ' Brien ' s lawyer , Willard H. DaSilva of Garden City , L.I. , warned that by failing to define precisely what constituted a professional degree or license , the opinion could create " turmoil " in the court. // " If a medical license is property , " he said , " then so too are licenses of every other sort - for truck drivers , pharmacists , beauticians , termite-control people - which require some form of educational enhancement. " // The decision did not address directly whether it applied equally to working and nonworking spouses . However , Judge Richard D. Simons , writing for the court , said that " equitable distribution was based on the premise that a marriage is , among other things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parent , wage earner or homemaker , and that these respective contributions should ordinarily be regarded as equal. " // While other states have held professional licenses to be separate property , Judge Simons wrote , the New York Legislature deliberately went further when it drafted the equitable-distribution law . That measure , he maintained , radically redefined the notion of property , creating a " new species of property previously unknown at common law or under prior statutes. " // The law of equitable distribution , he noted , defined " marital property " as " all property acquired by either or both spouses during the marriage , regardless of the form in which it is held . " <> <> ' Direct or Indirect ' Help // In applying that definition , he continued , the statute urged courts to consider such things as any " direct or indirect contribution " toward the acquisition of marital property , including " joint efforts or expenditures and contributions and services as a spouse , parent , wage earner and homemaker , and to the career or career potential of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better qualify as the type of joint effort that the statute ' s economic partnership theory is intended to address than contributions toward one spouse ' s acquisition of a professional license , " he wrote. // Under this new formulation of property , Judge Simons went on , it did not matter whether the license could be transferred or sold or had any value on the open market , or was even worth anything during the course of the marriage. // Mrs. O ' Brien , he wrote , " worked continuously during the marriage and contributed all of her earnings to their joint effort , she sacrificed her own educational and career opportunities , and she traveled with plaintiff to Mexico for three and a half years . " <> <> Economic Partnership // " The Legislature has decided , " he continued , " that these contributions represent investments in the economic partnership of the marriage and that the product of the parties ' joint efforts , the professional license , should be considered marital property. " // Mere reimbursement of her monetary investment in the marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a State Supreme Court justice in Westchester , Richard J. Daronco , ruled that Dr. O ' Brien ' s medical license was marital property , and calculated that Mrs. O ' Brien was entitled to 40 percent of its worth - a value he placed at $188 , 800 . His ruling was later reversed by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. // In its decision yesterday , the Court of Appeals upheld Justice Daronco ' s characterization of the license . But it found the basis of the judge ' s financial evaluation of the license ' s value inadequate and sent the case back to the Appellate Division to consider the matter anew. // Mrs. O ' Brien ' s lawyer , Albert J. Emanuelli , said yesterday that he was prepared to argue that the $188 , 800 was unfairly low. // Dr. O ' Brien , a 38-year-old primary-care physician , said that by the ongoing nature of medical education , a license should not be considered property. // He had argued that the marriage had long been unsatisfying , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through a divorce before and her father had threatened to hurt his career if he filed for one . <> <> ' An Investment Opportunity ' // " After all of the grief and vindictiveness that she ' s put me and my family through , I think she ' s been more than compensated for any moneys that may be owed , " he said . The ruling , he added , " just reiterates that I was being used as an investment opportunity , and now that investment has been paid off. " // The couple met in 1969 , when both were working in the shoe department of Gimbels in Westchester . Mrs. O ' Brien , who is now 39 , insisted that she and her family were largely responsible for her former husband ' s decision to enter medicine . Both she and her father , she said , encouraged him to complete his undergraduate schooling , then helped finance the premedical courses he needed to apply to medical school. // Dr. O ' Brien was ultimately admitted to Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara in 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had to learn Spanish to function in a new environment , held jobs teaching kindergarten and tutoring English . Her earnings , plus student loans and contributions from both families , helped pay for Dr. O ' Brien ' s education. // The couple returned to the United States in 1977 , where she resumed teaching and he continued his medical training . They separated in April 1980 , five months before Dr. O ' Brien received his medical license . He filed for divorce in December 1980 and she filed a counterclaim . The divorce was ultimately uncontested . <> <> ' Valuable Property Right ' // A professional license could be considered property even under traditional definitions of the term , Judge Simons wrote , because it is " a valuable property right , reflected in the money , effort and lost opportunity for employment expended in its acquisition , and also in the enhanced earning capacity it affords its holder , which may not be revoked without due process of law. " // " That a professional license has no market value is irrelevant , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce settlement , he added , is " no more difficult than computing tort damages for wrongful death or diminished earning capacity resulting from injury. " // In a concurring opinion , Judge Bernard S. Meyer warned that unfairness might result unless legislation were enacted allowing courts to modify property settlements should the license holder take a different , less remunerative career path . " The point is that equitable distribution was not intended to make a career decision for a licensed spouse still in training , " he wrote. // Sally Weinraub of the Westchester Women ' s Bar Association , which filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case , predicted that the ruling would be " very helpful for women. " // " In the past , judges have been somewhat cagey about making equitable-distribution awards , and women have suffered for it , " she said . " The Court of Appeals has indicated here that they should be more understanding of the realities of life when making such awards. " //                 @ @ @ @
