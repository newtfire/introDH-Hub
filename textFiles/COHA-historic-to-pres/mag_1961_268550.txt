In the control tower at Ndola , barely seven miles from the charred clearing slashed out by Dag Hammarskjold 's doomed plane , two men arranged the cease-fire he had set out to negotiate . After a two-day session , Katanga 's President Moise Tshombe and U.N . Negotiator Mahmoud Khiari signed a provisional truce , ending the eight-day Battle of Katanga . Unofficial death toll : 44 U.N . troops , 152 Katangese police and soldiers , 79 African civilians , 14 European civilians . <P> Although welcomed by both sides , the cease-fire was a defeat for the U.N. , which had obviously misjudged the strength and determination of Tshombe 's forces , and had taken a bad beating . It was an important victory in Tshombe 's running battle to keep Katanga free of the Congolese central government in Leopoldville . <P> Tshombe 's victory may not last long . Khiari made it plain at a press conference in Ndola that Katanga 's " secession is a matter of fact , but it is not legal nor is it a right . " Returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Katanga and the central government to find a peaceful solution , just as we achieved with the central government and the Stanleyville regime " of leftist Vice Premier Antoine Gizenga . <P> Meanwhile , the Congo government prepared for action . Premier Cyrille Adoula , ordinarily a moderate man , went into a rage over Katanga 's refusal to give in . General Joseph Mobutu , commander in chief of the army , started massing troops in a staging area across the border from Katanga , probably to forestall Gizenga , who reportedly was doing the same with his own private troops . <P> In Elisabethville , Tshombe had problems even more immediate than the possible invasion . Although the opposing armies grudgingly kept the truce , the city was in danger of attack by 30,000 starving Baluba tribesmen camped on the outskirts . Already Baluba raids had taken 40 lives , claimed Tshombe , announcing grimly : ' " I will not tolerate this situation . " The Congo political cycle was turning dangerously close to where it all began during the first bloody months of independence only 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war , U.N . forces got their first shipment of eight jets ( from Sweden and Ethiopia ) last week , and one Congolese Cabinet officer bought a bulletproof vest from a discreet St. James 's tailor in London .
