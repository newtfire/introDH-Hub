ART . IX. - SKETCH OF THE LIFE AND CHARACTER OF THE HON. DAVID DAGGETT . THE eminent public services of the Hon. David Daggett , lately deceased , and his wide reputation , especially as Professor in the Law Department of Yale College , and as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Connecticut , have induced the Editors of the New Englander to request for publication the following address , sketching his life and character , which was given on the occasion of his burial by the Rev. S. W. S. Dutton . There lies before us , in death , no more henceforth to be seen among the living , robed for the grave , the form of one whom we have long looked upon with admiration , affection and reverence ; one , who , through a long life , has been eminent in the public service ; one whom this town , and city , and College , and State , have willingly trusted and delighted to honor . // This mournful event has not come upon us suddenly . We have long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friend , once vigorous and active , " the observed of all observers** in our streets and public resorts , gradually withdrawn by the growing infirmities of age to complete seclusion in his own dwelling . That voice , which once rung like a clarion in the halls of justice and of legislation , and in the clear music of social converse , has been losing its fullness and power . We have seen a falling away in that bold and strong Roman face , and dimness stealing the fire of that eagle eye . That brisk step , which was once seen in our streets before the sun of each morning , we have observed to grow more and more feeble and tottering . And that noble form , with its antique and peculiar but comely dress , which was once seen every day by our citizens , and in the sanctuary as regularly as the gates of Zion were opened on the Sabbath , has been gradually , and at length wholly , withdrawn from public view . We have known that the days of man 's years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourscore years , it is by reason of strength ; and that when they are near to fourscore and ten , they must soon be cut off . And when it was learned that disease had come upon our friend in his extreme age , we all felt that but one event could be reasonably expected . But our expectation of this event , our certainty that it could not be long deferred , does not divest it of sorrow . Our sorrow is indeed calm and tranquil . It is not the sorrow of those who mourn over one cut down in the prime , or the midst , of his days and his usefulness : for our friend is borne , a patriarch , to his grave , " as a shock of corn cometh in its season . " It is not the sorrow of disappointed expectations , broken plans and blighted hopes . It is not the sorrow of that overwhelming shock , which bears away the trusted , the honored and the loved in the full exercise of their activities ; which rends away the pillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church and the family : for , as often happens in the divine kindness , the gentle ministries of advancing age had removed , one by one , the ties which bound our friend to a life of activity and duty , and had transferred slowly , safely and completely to other hands the offices and labors which once were his . His public burdens had all been borne and laid aside . His trusts had all been discharged , both without and within his home . His work had all been done . Nor yet is our sorrow that bitterest of all  --  the sorrow of those who have no hope in respect to the future life of a friend departed . Nevertheless , our sorrow is sorrow indeed  --  the sorrow of those who see worth and nobleness passing away from among us ; and especially the sorrow which must flow from the tender ties of nature and affection , when sundered and bleeding . We are never readynature // never can be ready  --  to have those ties severed ; though faith and piety can submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is well , then , for sorrowing friends , a sorrowing church , a sorrowing community , and more deeply sorrowing kindred , to mingle , in this hour , their griefs and sympathies . And especially is it wellit is due-before we consign to the house of the grave one who has performed so many public services , to review his life and character , that we may be grateful for what God has done for our fathers and for us through him , and that we may gather wisdom from the survey of his virtues . DAVID DAGGETT was born in Attleborough , in the county of Bristol , in the commonwealth of Massachusetts , on the 31st of December , 1764 ; and , of course , at the day of his decease , April 12 , 1851 , had passed through three months and twelve days of his eighty-seventh year . He was of that stock , which we have so much reason to honor and reverence , the Puritan stock of the New England Pilgrims ; being the fifth in the direct line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Winthrop 's company in 1630 , and settled in Watertown , in the Colony of Massachusetts . His son , Thomas Daggett , Esq. , resided in Edgartown , on Martha 's Vineyard . He removed thither , it is supposed , with the first Governor Mayhew , when he settled that island in 1644 . He married Hannah , the oldest daughter of Governor Mayhew , was a magistrate of the island , and died about the year 1690 . His son , Deacon John Daggett , the second in the line from the original settler , removed , with four sons , about the year 1707 , from Martha 's Vineyard to Attleborough , Bristol county , Massachusetts , where he built , for protection against the Indians , what was called a " garrison house , " in which he lived . It is quite remarkable that of the four sons of this Deacon John Daggett , three have , for many generations , been represented by theirdescendants , in New Haven ; viz. , Mayhew Daggett , the grandfather of the late Henry Daggett , Esq. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High streets ; Ebenezer Daggett , the father of Rev. Dr. Daggett , Professor of Divinity and President in Yale College , and grandfather of the late Captain Henry Daggett , whose residence was in George street ; and Thomas Daggett , the grandfather of David Daggett , whose death we now mourn . The fourth son , Naphthali Daggett , met an untimely death by the falling of a tree in Attleborough . The fourth in this line of descent , also named Thomas Daggett , the father of our lamented friend , was a man of vigorous intellect , strong common sense , and decided and earnest religious character . I have often heard our venerable friend speak of his father 's strong sympathy // with the friends of the " Great Awakening , ' * which occurred in the earlier part of his manhood , under the preaching of Whitfield , Edwards , Bellamy and the Tennents . In the controversy , which in subsequent years grew out of that Awakening , he was earnestly on the side of its friends ; so much so that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he never united himself with them . He was a Baptist in sentiment ; and his influence as such had a modifying , though not a decisive , effect on the opinions of his son through life . Under the nurture and admonition of such a father , the son received thorough and judicious religious instruction , commended by a corresponding example ; and was well trained in the principles of virtue and piety . At the age of sixteen he came to Yale College , and entered the Junior Class , two years in advance ; induced to choose this rather than the nearer College at Harvard , probably by the fact that Rev. Dr. Daggett , the first cousin of his father , who deceased the year before , had been an officer in Yale . He graduated in due course , and with high honor , in the year 1783 , in the same class with Samuel Austin , Abiel Holmes , and John Cotton Smith . Of this class , numbering forty-two at the time of graduation , he is the last survivor but one. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was during the latter part of the stormy and trying period of the American Revolution . His class entered during the year in which the British troops , under General rrryon , invaded New Haven ; and graduated in the very month in which the treaty of peace with Great Britain was signed . When he took his second , or Master 's degree , he spoke an oration of such marked excellence that it received the honor , quite unusual in that day , of publication . Having a strong preference for the profession of the law , he commenced , soon after leaving College , the study preparatory to that profession , with Charles Chauncey , Esq. , of New Haven , afterwards a Judge of the Superior Court ; and continued therein till January , 1786 , a little more than two years ; when he was admitted to the bar of New Haven county , at the age of twenty-one , and immediately entered upon practice in this town . While pursuing his legal studies under Judge Chauncey , he supported himself by performing the duties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grammar School . A few months after he was admitted to the Bar , he was chosen to the office of Tutor in Yale College : which he declined , being eager to pursue the practice of the profession which he had chosen . Mr. Daggett was early callQd into political service . In 1791 , he // was chosen to represent the town of New Haven in the General Assembly ; and was annually re-elected for six years , till 1797 , when he was chosen a member of the Council or Upper House . Though one of the youngest members of the House of Representatives , he soon became one of the most influential ; and in 1794 , three years after he entered the House , he was chosen to preside over it as its Speaker , at the early age of twenty-nine . To this office he was elected , year after year , till he was chosen to the Council or Upper House . This body was then constituted in a manner , very different from that in which our present Senate or Upper House is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons were chosen , not from particular districts , but from wherever in the whole State the ablest men could be found ; and out of these twenty , twelve were chosen at the election in the spring  --  the twelve who had the highest number of votes  --  to constitute the Senate . The members of that body , thus chosen , were rarely changed . They were usually re-elected , until they forfeited public confidence by mal-conduct , or were promoted to some higher office , or voluntarily resigned . It was thus an unusually permanent body for an elective one , and embraced much of the political wisdom , ability and experience of the State . To this body , Mr. Daggett was transferred from the chair of the House of Representatives , in 1797 ; and he retained his seat there , for seven years , until he resigned it in 1804 . In 1805 , he was again a member of the House of Representatives . In 1809 , he was again chosen a member of the Upper House of the General Assembly ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years , till May , 1813 , when he was chosen a Senator in the Congress of the United States , for six years from the preceding fourth of March . In June , 1811 , he was appointed State 's Attorney for the county of New Haven , and continued in that office till he resigned it , when chosen Senator in 1813 . At the close of his Senatorial term , in 1819 , he returned to his extensive practice of law , which conduced much more to his private interest than had the public service of the State , in which he had been engaged as her representative in the Senate of the United States . In November , 1824 , he became an associate instructor of the Law School in this city with the late Judge Hitchcock ; and in 1826 , he was appointed Kent Professor of Law in Yale College . In these positions he continued , until , at a very advanced age , his infirmities induced him to resign them . In the autumn of 1826 , he received from the corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , 1826 , when he was sixty-two years of age , he was chosen an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of this State . To this office he was appointed by a legislature , in which a decided majority were opposed to him in political principles and preferences . This fact is // worthy of remark , on account of its strong testimony to his preeminent fitness , at that time , for that high office , and also on account of the honorable testimony which it gives respecting his political opponents-whom he never courted , and in political conflict never spared-that in the election to an office so responsible , so remote from political interests and strifes , as that of a Judge of our Supr*me Court , they were willing to lay aside partisan partialities , and to be controlled by a regard to superior intellectual , legal and moral qualifications . During the years 1828 and 1829 he was Mayor of the city of New Haven . In May , 1832 , he was made Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . Here , again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contrary to the usual custom , he was appointed to that chief place notwithstanding the fact that he was not the senior in office among the judges on the bench . Judge Daggett continued to perform the duties of that station until December 31st , 1834 ; when he reached seventy years of age  --  the limit which our State Constitution assigns to the judicial office . Thu5 for forty-four years , from the close of his twenty-sixth to the close of his seventieth year , Mr. Daggett was almost continually engaged in public service , as member and Speaker of the House of Representatives of this State , member of its Council , Senator in the Congress of the United States , and Associate and Chief Judge of our Supreme Court . The eminence of Judge Daggett , in his profession , and among the public men of the State , is sufficiently attested by the preceding account of the many positions of high responsibility and trust , in which he was placed by the guardians of Yale College , and by the people of this town , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party to which he belonged , which was dominant in the State tifl he was past middle life , and gave him the most of his honors , effibraced , confessedly , many of the most powerful and brilliant minds of the State and if we remember also , that some of the highest of these trusts were devolved upon him when his political opponents had come into power , and his own party had passed into a minority . Mr. Daggett was admitted to the bar , and entered into public life , two years before the adoption of the Federal Constitution . Of the political parties which grew out of the adoption of that Constitution , he united , as did a great body of the people of New England at that time , with that which was called Federal . Of this party , though he was not a mere partisan but a true statesman , he was a firm , consistent , and thorough suppc rter . In the Legislature of the State , and as a Senator of the United States , he was a sagacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among its many strong men in this State , it had none stronger than he . For many years , no man in the State had so much political influence , an influence amounting so nearly to a political control of the State , as he . And since the defeat and prostration of that party and the formation of new parties on new issues , he , certainly , has never been ashamed , or reluctant , to have it known , that he belonged to the same school of politics with Washington and Hamilton , Jay and Pickering , Adams and Ames , Ellsworth and Sherman . If we inquire for the qualities which rendered Judge Daggett so able and eminent in forensic and political life , that which was , perhaps. , most remarkable , was his perspicacity-his faculty of quick and thorough insight-of looking through , speedily and completely , men , measures and cases , and learning what was in them . This faculty was of great service to him in society , in political life , and in court , whether at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost intuition . He looked through them at a glance , and read their characters , motives and tendencies . He knew at once his jury , the witnesses , and the opposing counsel , and understood , of course , how to deal with them . If a witness knew the truths but was reluctant to unfold or desirous to conceal that knowledge ; he perceived the fact , and well understood how to bring out his testimony . If a witness was dishonest , he saw it , and knew just where his fraud lay , and how to detect and expose it . His cases he comprehended thoroughly , and saw them in their just proportions ; knowing accurately their strong , their weak , and their unimportant points-those which demanded notice and stress , those which would not bear it , and those which would occupy time to no purpose , except weariness of judge and jury . United with this faculty , was well-balanced judgment and strong common sense . In his own intellectual efforts , he directed his force , as by a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was far as possible from learned folly , . intellectual quixotism , or the expenditure of acuteness to no good purpose . He could split hairs , if it was necessary : for he was acute in discrimination , and profound in analysis ; but he never would split hairs for nothipg , or for the sake of the performance . As a lawyer and a judge , he would not be under bondage to nice quibbles or legal technicalities , but took a plain and common-sense course to that which was the real intent of the law ; and he preferred to lean to the side of equity and sound judgment , rather than to the side of legal formality . And , in judging of the intellectual efforts of others , he always liked those middle ground and common ground arguments , which carry the convictions of the great body of intelligent people , rather // than those extreme and doubtful , though ingenious arguments , which commend themselves only to the few . And this faculty of mind , in connection with his quick and thorough perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply testimony so as to make the strongest impression of the merits of his case upon the judge , and especially upon the jury . He had also an exquisite and quick sense of propriety or fitness . He knew how to do and say the right thing , in the right time and place . He used often to remark that he admired what the Greeks call *6 *Tp&amp;w ' : and surely , few ever understood it , or exemplified it , better than he . This quality rendered him very agreeable to others , and was of great service to him in his public life , especially at the bar . It gave him great tact . He knew just what suited what , and how to bring them together so as to produce the right result . He never did anything which was mal-apropos . He never stepped on the wrong spot . He never touched the wrong spring or key . He rarely blundered , in word or deed . He abounded also in wit and humor , and had an inexhaustible fund of anecdotes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his positions and arguments , with great pertinence and felicity . He had a keen sense of the ludicrous , and remarkable power of pantomime-of imitating voice , look and manner-which he employed very effectively , when he related anecdotes , or when he wished to make his adversaries appear ridiculous . He had the rare and very effective rhetorical power of passing suddenly from the humorous and ludicrous , to the solemn , vehement and impressive , and of changing the laughter of his hearers into stern conviction , or indignation , or tears . His memory was accurate and retentive ; and it had the excellent quality of retaining what was pertinent , and of letting the rest go . He took very few notes during a trial ; yet everything in the case was at his command when it was needed for use , and the right illustrations were ever ready at the right points . He had great energy of feeling , Which , kindling up as he proceeded with his case , gave impressiveness to his words , and set his argument on fire . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he espoused , and had a singular power of identifying himself with his client . His power of concentration also was distinguished . He was almost uniformly brief in his arguments , rarely occupying more than an hour ; yet they embraced in their dense and compact but luminous volume , all that was essential , or really useful , for his purpose . All who have heard him agree in testifying , that his most marked peculiarity in the management of his cases was , that he saw , and distinguished clearly , the minor and the strong points , and passing // 304 May , entirely or rapidly over the former , seized upon the latter with force and thorough comprehension , set them forth in all their strength , and pressed them with great earnestness and power upon the court and jury . His language , remarkable for its perspicuity , energy and impressiveness , and abounding in the strong Saxon words which are the common inheritance of all who speak the English tongue , enabled him to present vividly before others the truth , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough , and eminently practical . He had it at command , when it was needed . His arguments , addressed to the court , were able and luminous ; and he applied to his cases the principles of law , as well as the testimony of witnesses , with great sagacity . He relied more , however , on the resources of his own mind , upon his clear and quick perceptions of the nature and relations of things , on his profound thought , and strong common sense , than upon the erudition of books ; though he had a good professional library , which he used to great advantage . His manner of speaking was calm and deliberate , when he began ; but as he proceeded with his case or subject , his feelings kindled , his language glowed , his eye , tones and person spoke in unison with his words , and often , in his peroration , he overwhelmed his adversary as by a resistless torrent . The features of Judge Daggett 's intellectual character which have been mentioned , his quick and thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his quick and ready perception of fitness , his wit and humor , his power of varied and felicitous illustration , his ready memory , his energy of feeling , his concentration , his clear and nervous language , his practical knowledge of law-these , joined to his qualities of person and manner-his tall and commanding form , always dre*sed carefully , richly , and in perfect taste , rising and dilating as he warmed with his subject , his large and piercing eye , his expressive brow , his strong-featured Roman face , his powerful voice ranging through the whole scale , from a subdued yet distinct whisper , till it sounded like a trumpet-call , his utterance varying from solemn deliberation to the vehemence of a torrent-these qualities of mind , person and manner , made him an advocate , who , in his best days , had , on the whole , no superior , if he had an equal , at the bar of Connecticut . There are other qualities of Judge Daggett 's character as a public man which should not be omitted in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is needed for other parts of the subject , compels me to speak of them briefly . His punctuality was most extraordinary . The pointers of the town clock , the sun itself , hardly surpassed him in this respect . His integrity was thorough , stern and exact ; and secured entire confidence . // He manifested particular kindness to those who were beginning life , especially in his own profession ; sympathizing with them in their difficulties and anxieties , because he remembered his own . He had a just idea of the nature , and a thorough appreciation of the rules , of civility and courtesy at the bar ; and observed them scrupulously in his own conduct . He was fair in his treatment of witnesses ; regarding their feelings ; never harsh and overbearing toward them , unless indeed they deserved severity , when he knew well how to use it ; never resorting to the unscrupulous method of making an honest opposing witness appear ridiculous , or confused and perplexed , in order to impair the just force of his testimony . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known " from a child , " and had studied in his manhood more than any other book . The power of its self-commending truths and of its strong and popular language over the minds of men he appreciated highly . Its expressions were stored in his memory in great abundance and with singular accuracy ; and he was accustomed to introduce them , when a Judge into his charges and especially into his addresses to the convicted , and when an advocate into his arguments and appeals , with great pertinence and felicity , solemnity and power . A few words respecting Judge IDaggett as he appeared in social life . He was a true and accomplished gentleman . He was , in a very extraordinary degree , polished in his manners , and gracefully and scrupulously observant of all civilities . His courtesy was remarkable . He was disposed to please all whom he met ; and his almost instinctive sense of propriety , and his graceful and easy manners and language enabled him to do so : and this made him a model of courtesy . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and friends , he was an example , such as is rarely if ever found in these days . His courtesy , his varied knowledge of men and things , his lively feelings , accommodated readily to the old and the young , his cheerfulness , his wit and humor , his fund of anecdote , and his reminiscences of the past , made him the life of every social circle into which he entered . The domestic life of Mr. Daggett was commenced early . At the age of twenty-one , soon after he began the practice of law in New Haven , he was united in marriage to Wealthy Ann , daughter of IDr. iEneas Munson ; with whom he lived , in confiding attach-* ment , and with almost reverential regard for her strong and marked intellectual and religious character , for fifty-three years , till death removed her from him for a time , in July , 1839 , at the age of seventy-two . Judge Daggett 's home , although filled with comforts // and joys , was darkened by the sorrows of many bereavements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first marriage , and of the fourteen who lived any considerable time only three survive him ; and these , by the favor of Providence , have had the mournful privilege of smoothing his pillow in his last sickness , and to-day foll ? w him to his last earthly house in the grave . So many children , with their mother , the beloved wife of his youth , he has followed , in the path of grief , to the tomb . Such was the strength of his parental feelings , that these bereavements took deep hold of him . With one of them he was completely overwhelmed  --  a bereavement by the death of a son , in his nineteenth year , of unusual loveliness and promise , who bore his father 's name , and had devoted himself in purpose and heart to the ministry of Christ . This was a sorrow from which he never entirely recovered ; though the blow feli upon his heart forty-one years since . It is not long ago that he said to a friend : " There has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not thought of that beloved son . " Thus it is , that they who die in their early promise , are embalmed in the memory , and prolong , as it were , their earthly life by living in the hearts of surviving friends . In May , 1840 , Judge Daggett was married , a second time , to Mary , daughter of Major Lines , who , by her devoted affection and kindness , her cheerful society , and her anticipation of his every want , has been the joy and solace of his declining years ; while she has made his home a pleasant resort , not only for his children and his children 's children , but for all his friends . Let us turn now , in conclusion , to view the religious life and character of our friend . Oh , that is the point to which , in this solemn hour , we look with paramount interest . His earthly honors would , in this hour , be poor consolation to us , did we not trust that he is an inheritor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which comes from God . It would be mournful , indeed , to dwell upon his public services , did we not believe that he was a servant of Christ , and has heard from him the benediction , Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord . " Reference has already been made to the thorough religious training which Mr. Daggett received in his childhood and youth . This " nurture and admonition of the Lord " under the parental roof , and the memories and records of his pious ancestry , had a strong influence upon him . He commenced his active life with great respect for religion and its ordinances . He began at once to be a liberal supporter of its institutions , as he was through life , and a regular and attentive hearer of the gospel in the sanctuary ; uniting himself with this ecclesiastical society i. e. that connected with the North // Church , of which Rev. Dr. Jonathan Edwards was then pastor . He always took a great pleasure in hearing the doctrines and precepts of God 's Word thoroughly and discriminatingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cordially and savingly regard them . Indeed , he was quite an enthusiast with regard to preaching , and received great intellectual satisfaction in hearing , whenever he had an opportunity , the ablest ministers of his time ; and they had no better judges of their discourses than he . The various and severe discipline of bereavement with which it pleased God to visit Mr. Daggett , had the effect to bring him near to the kingdom of God , especially the death of his son David , which has been mentioned , and the death of a beloved daughter , his youngest child . Soon after the death of the latter , which was in 1815 , he felt constrained to commence family worship , which he continued from that time through life . Another influence which had great and continued effect upon him , ought to be mentioned . His wife was a woman of decided piety , eminent in faith and prayer . She was in the habit , not only of praying herself for him at all times , but also of making appointment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in the day , to plead in concert at the throne of grace , for the conversion of the husband and the father . She always cherished strong confidence that he would be brought into the fold of Christ , and she was not disappointed . It was not , however , till the year 1832 , that Judge Daggett , in his own view and that of his friends , began a really religious life . In April of that year , during one of those " times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord , " of which the Holy Scriptures speak , and which the Church in her glad experience has so often realized , there were in this city continuous religious services for a few days . The power of the Holy Ghost was upon the community , and Judge Daggett and many others among our elder men of distinction , were seriously moved . On one afternoon , when there was to be religious service in the evening , his wife and children observed that he walked his hall for hours , evidently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an earnest and thorough presentation of the gospel , those who were disposed to take a position , expressive of their desire to become the friends and servants of Christ , were invited to remain in their seats , while the other portion of the audience should retire . Judge Daggett remained . After a few words of explanation , direction and exhortation from a minister of Christ , those who were resolved , by the divine help , to serve and love and trust the Savior of sinners , were invited to rise . Judge Daggett rose . And the decision , which he then , in that signal manner , expressed , he adhered to and cherished through life . // * That was a period of rich grace and abounding joy in the house of our friend : for not only he but his youngest son , then in the profession of the law , consecrated himself to Christ ; and the father has often , in subsequent years , had the pleasure of listening to the Gospel from the lips of that son . Four months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of sixty-eight , stood up in this aisle , near where his body now lies , and publicly expressed his repentance toward God and his faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ , avowing the ever living and true God to be his God ; and covenanting , by the help of divine grace , to give himself up through life , to the Lord Jesus Christ , to be taught and governed by him , and to walk with this church in the divine ordinances . Since that period , he has acted in the various relations of life according to this good confession . He has been an interested and edified attendant on the services of the sanctuary , and the weekly meeting of the church for prayer and conference , until prevented by the increasing infirmities of age . In social religious services he did not ( as many desired , and as indeed was very desirable ) take an active or leading part . But he felt a reluctance to take the attitude of instruction and exhortation in matters of spiritual experience , and thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edified by others more than he could edify them . Judge Daggett never spoke freely of his private feelings on any subject ; and especially on the sacred subject of religion . Yet there were those , who , he thought , had a right to know his religious feelings ; and to them he would speak willingly and freely . A little more than a year since , he had a full and unreserved conversation respecting his religious condition , hopes , and prospects , with one in whom he confided . He commenced his answer to an inquiry made on that point , by adopting , as his own , the remark of a distinguished Christian minister : " I feel that it is a very solemn thing for a sinful man to go into the presence of a holy God . " But he added , that he approved and loved the way of salvation by the atonement of Christ ; that he daily committed his soul in love , loyalty and confidence to the Savior of sinners ; and believed that he was accepted now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not able to sympathize as fully as he desired , with the strong expressions of assurance in which it seemed the privilege of some to indulge . During the last years and months of his life , Judge Daggett has turned his attention with more and more of exclusiveness to religious subjects ; and the reading which he has chosen to hear has been almost wholly of that character . Having a constitution singularly tenacious of life , Judge Daggett // has had more than the usual dread of death . But in his case , as with God 's people usually , the truth of " grace according to the day " was illustrated . He met death without fear or anxiety . It was quite evident to him that this was his last illness ; yet he felt no concern . And when one inquired respecting the state of his mind , he referred immediately to his conversation with the person who made the inquiry , more than a year previous , as expressing fully his present feelings . Thus leaving himself quietly in the hands of his Savior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we may believe , into the rest and joy of his Lord . The length to which this address has been protracted , almost necessarily in giving an account of a life , so long and so crowded with matter for observation , precludes any extended remarks in closing . I will content myself with a few words . The fathers ! where are they ? Those , who , a few years since , were regarded as the fathers in this church and this community ! Where are they ? Gentlemen of the Bar , those who a few years since were regarded as the seniors in your profession in this citywhere are they ? But one remains . Would , for our sakes , though not for his , that he might remain with us always . But it will not be . It can barely be said that he is here : for he is daily waiting , in the serenity of patience and hope , and in the confidence of faith , for his departure. * And you , who , a short time since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now been moved forward to stand in the front rank , before the open grave ! May God give you grace so to number your days , as to apply your hearts unto wisdom ! Gentlemen and friends , each and all , you have regarded him whose body lies before us as worthy in many respects of your imitation . Oh , that you would imitate him in the consecration of yourselves to Christ ! He felt , that , in comparison with an interest in Christ , worldly honors were nothing , worldly wealth nothing , the whole world nothing . And this feeling controlled him . May it control you !
