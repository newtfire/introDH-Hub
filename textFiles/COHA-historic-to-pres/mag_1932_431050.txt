THE newspapers had carried the story ? " Long-Lost Sweetheart of Sir Thomas Lipton 's Youth Found At Last " ; " Duluth Woman Reveals Romance With Lipton " ; " Sportsman Retained His Early Love and Preferred to Be Bachelor " ? countless headlines in all the large daily papers of this country . So I went to Duluth to get the real story , the love story whose details the newspapers had skipped over so lightly . On the train I recalled the legend which had grown up about the famous yachtsman  - -  that he had never married because of one girl , a girl whom he had loved in his youth . He was said never to have spoken of her , laughingly pointing to his yacht as his only love . But now , almost a year after his death , the secret which he had kept hidden in his heart all those years had been revealed by this woman whom I was going to see . With her married daughter , in a modest little house far out from the center of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Catherine McLeod Stewart . As I rang the bell , I thought of pictures I had seen of Sir Thomas ' elaborate place at Sougthgate , England . Through a hallway and bright living room I went to the dining room , where a sweet-faced , little gray-haired woman was sitting at the table , preparing some dates . She looked up suspiciously . " If it 's about that story , " she said instantly , " I wo n't talk about it . It is n't true ! I was n't his sweetheart ! " I looked at her ; her fingers were shaking as she stoned the dates ; her mouth , set in a hard line , was twitching . I could n't believe what I was hearing . It seemed incredible that all the cosmopolitan newspapers had published a story which was untrue ; incredible , also , that my vision of the story could be so immediately and ruthlessly destroyed . " There is n't any story , " she went on in that agitated , quivering voice . " Those reporters ? they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . . . . It 's all - been too un-pleasant ! " " But , Mrs. Stewart , did n't you even know Sir Thomas Lipton ? " I asked . " Yes , I knew him . But we were only friends . They said that he asked me to marry him and that I jilted him . Jilted Tommy Lipton ! He was too fine a gentleman ! And I did n't meet him at a dance at Glasgow , either . Young girls were n't permitted to go to dances without a chaperone . And besides , it was n't at Glasgow at all where I met him . " She was almost hysterical in her indignant denial that she had jilted Lipton . She seemed to feel that the statement tended to discredit him . " jilted him ! " Her eyes glinted with resentment ; and over and over she repeated , " He was too fine a gentleman ! " But her agitation seemed to have a deeper cause than discrepancies in the news stories . Could it be grief over having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one to read ? Or perhaps it was a feeling of betrayed loyalty to a cherished memory ? I told her of the distance I had come , and then she said , " You must be tired , " and invited me to sit down . She showed me a letter which had distressed her . It was from an Englishman who said that he was a member of one of Sir Thomas ' clubs , mentioned Lipton 's vast wealth , and asked why she had not been remembered . Eventually , after I had assured her that I was interested only in the true story , she became more friendly and consented to tell me of how she had met Lipton . Reluctantly at first , and guardedly she spoke , as if afraid of revealing too much . Once she said , " There are memories which we keep in our hearts ? things that we could never bear to have read . After all , it 's my secret ? why should every one be so interested in it ? " And again , dreamily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . But then , I was so young . What does a girl of nineteen know of life and love ? She should n't have any thoughts of marriage at that age . " But sometimes , as she talked , the guard she had erected fell away , and a light came into her eyes ? such a light as comes into the eyes of every woman when she speaks of her first love . Through that gleam the years seemed to drop away , and her stillpretty face reflected the vision of that gay  | Scotch lass standing by the roadside , saucily mimicking the rich Irish brogue of Tommy Lipton , and then primly refusing to go driving with him " because I do n't know you . " She frequently interrupted the narrative to deny that they were sweethearts . But she told , in her Scottish accent , this story : " I was only nineteen then , and I am sixty-seven now , but somehow it does n't seem that long . It was a day in late lurch in the little resort village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the northeastern shore of Scotland . A pretty little village it was , with its front doors opening almost on to the sea and many hills rising steeply behind . And a clear , warm day for March . The clouds were white and puffy and high in the blue sky , and the sun shone on scattered patches of yellow primroses and white snowdrops . Soon , I thought , the heather would be blooming , and the fields and hills would be purple with it . " Such a lovely day it was ? but I did n't have much time to watch the clouds floating above or the sun on the primroses . It was my day to keep the toll house , and I had to watch the road . The shipbuilding trade in Glasgow had grown slack that year and failed to bring enough shillings for my father , Donald McLeod , to support his family . He heard of this toll house for lease , and we moved to the resort village for the season . " I was the second oldest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , my mother , and I ? took turns at watching the road and collecting toll . There was no gate to halt the travelers and we had to keep a sharp lookout to see that a shepherd driving his flocks from the hills , or a resort visitor in his carriage , did not pass without paying the fee . It was n't a large fee , but it made our living . " I was sitting in the doorway bandaging my foot . The sunshine had called me out early that morning , and while I was picking flowers in the hills , I stepped on a sharp stone . The foot hurt , and I was concerned only with trying to bandage it , when I heard the beat of hoofs on the road . " Quickly I pulled my sandal on over the bandage . Whoever the rider was , he was coming at a good gait , and I would barely have time to hobble out to the roadside on my sore foot . " At my signal a pair of horses reared their front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden stop . I stepped back from their prancing hoofs and admired their sleeklygroomed black coats , glistening in the sun . I loved horses , and these , you could easily see , were of fine , spirited stock and handsomely matched . But for some reason , my eyes were drawn from the horses , and I turned to look at the driver . I gazed right into deep blue eyes that seemed to laugh back at me . I looked at his hair that was dark and curly and waved back from a fine forehead ; and at a face that was rugged and yet sensitive . The boy appeared several years older than I. " His blue Irish eyes looked frankly back at me . They twinkled , as if pleased at what they saw . I guess I was rather pretty then . My hair was wavy and so heavy that I had to plait it into pigtails , and the ends always curled . I had big eyes ? hazel they were ? and long lashes . " So we looked at each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alert in the driver 's seat . Something was in the air ? I do n't know what we expected . He spoke first . " Sure and something 's wrong with your foot ? ' " I thrust the foot behind me . Strange young men should not be commenting on a girl 's foot , even if it was injured ! I stiffened with all the dignity I  | ( Continued from page 39 ) could muster and was just ready to give him a sharp rebuff when I looked again at his face . Only kindliness and sympathy were there . I could n't say what I had planned , so I smiled . " Yes , and it hurts a bit . It 's a stone bruise . I got it this morning climbing that steep hill over there , picking flowers , ' I explained . " Well , you should n't be walking about on it , my lass . Stone bruises can be bad things . You should be in bed and having a doctor looking after it . ' " There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had noticed my foot . The sympathy in that rich Irish voice of his , and something kind in his manner , kindled a glow in me . I could feel the blush spreading up to my face and neck . I felt awkward , embarrassed , and a bit silly , standing there . " It 's a fine wagonette and horses you 're driving , ' I said to take his attention from my burning face . But my eyes were not on the vehicle with its broad seat in front and other seats along each side . I saw only the driver . I liked the way his small cap perched jauntily on the dark waves of his hair , the broad shoulders under the dark suit , the strong look of him , sitting so fine and straight in the driver 's seat . He was quick to reply . " Sure and it 's lonesome up here by meself . Would n't you like to take a drive ? ' " Sure and I 'm too busy , ' I mocked , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , sir ! ' " He chuckled , his face breaking into little crinkles of laughter . But he did n't say anything more . He gathered up the reins , and the horses started down the road . " I watched until the wagonette went round a turn in the highway , and then stood looking toward the greenness into which it had disappeared . Turning slowly , I seemed to see the whole sweep of the countryside , until my eyes came back to the house . The toll ! We had forgotten it ! " THE next morning I was up early , and I offered to watch the toll again that day . There must have been something new in my vcice , for my mother looked at me with a puzzled expression . I knew what she was thinking ? that I was n't usually so anxious to mind the toll . But she shook her head . " Not this morning , Catherine . I 've something else for you to do . I want you to go down to the village for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boys go ? ' " No , the boys do n't know about things for the house . What is the matter with you today , my lass ? I thought that you liked to go to the village where you could talk to the girls and the young lads . Here , now , take this list and be sure you pick a good piece of meat . ' " So , with the basket on my arm , I walked down the winding road to the village . For some reason I was n't so excited as usual over going shopping and looking into the store windows . I kept thinking of the handsome stranger . I did n't even know his name . Was he staying at the village , or was he just a traveler going to Edinburgh ? Perhaps I 'd never see him again . I kicked at the stones along the roadside , wondering . Whenever I heard the beat of hoofs on the road , I looked up until the carriage had passed . Once I thought a wagonette was approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it came near enough for me to see the driver . His eyes were not blue , and his hair was not curly . One of the resoit visitors , I thought . He offered me a lift , but 1 shook my head . " In the village , I walked slowly along until I came to the shop where my mother traded . I looked up and down the one street , but no carriages were in sight , so I went in . I was glad to find Anne , the shopkeeper 's daughter , tending store , for I wanted to ask her if any new visitors were in the village . " But I did n't have time , for Anne rushed up to tell me some exciting news of her own .  |
