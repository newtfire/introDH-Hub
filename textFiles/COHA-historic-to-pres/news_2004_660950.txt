First came the hammer , and now US military officials say it 's time for the anvil . <p> After nearly a month of Pakistani forces on their own side of the border pressing pro-Taliban tribes , the US military announced this weekend the beginning of Operation Mountain Storm in Afghanistan . The new name marks the unprecedented coordination between Pakistani and US coalition forces to close the net around Taliban and Al Qaeda border hideouts . <p> " This operation is aimed like the rest at ... reconstruction and providing enduring security in Afghanistan so it is certainly about more than one person , " said Lt. Col. Bryan Hilferty , US military spokesman in Kabul . The statement is a nod to concerns that US troops have been too focused on nabbing big targets like Osama bin Laden at the expense of wider policing . <p> Afghans living here in the border province of Paktika are among those who appreciate the US presence , but are upset with the lack of security throughout the region , not just the border . <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important part of Afghanistan 's overall security . And the increased patrols here have already netted one success . On March 5 , US forces and soldiers from the fledgling Afghan National Army beat back an attack by anticoalition fighters in the Paktika village of Sesandeh , near the border . Nine anticoalition fighters were killed , and seven were captured . <p> " We were in our base when it was attacked , " says Javed Ahmad , an ANA soldier from Khost , who took part in the battle . " There were foreigners and Afghans both , and the foreigners were Pakistanis . They had Kalashnikovs , heavy machine guns , rocket propelled grenades , and mortars . We were surprised they were able to bring such heavy weapons to attack our base . We thought they must have had local support , so we searched the area . " <p> But for every success like this one , there are several other cases of antigovernment attacks that go unchallenged . <p> Local officials here say that a rocket landed near the Paktika governor 's house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was airlifted to Bagram Air Base near Kabul . Fourteen other rockets were discovered at the launch site , their timing devices apparently having malfunctioned . <p> Two days later , a local judge named Naeem was kidnapped near the village of Waza Khwa , near the Pakistani border . He was released a few days later after the intervention of local tribal elders . <p> Here in Urgun , a dusty market town just 40 miles west of the Pakistani border , local Afghans say they welcome US military forces . But like most people caught in a war zone , the men and women of Paktika find themselves between two bitter enemies , and trusted by neither side . <p> " People in Pakistan call us Americans because we keep Americans here ; and in Kabul , our own government calls us Al Qaeda , " says Baseer Ahmad , a senior student at an Islamic seminary near Urgun . " We are like a volleyball being tossed from one side of the net to the other side . " <p> With a population of just a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most forbidding terrain in Afghanistan , Paktika is certainly not an easy place to love . <p> Out of 22 districts , 14 are no longer reliably under government control , according to a recent UN internal report . One of these , Barmal district fell to Taliban forces nearly a year ago . While US forces have moved into the district , it remains unsafe for pro-Karzai officials or for aid groups . In the 13 remaining districts , local government provides few benefits and little effective control . <p> To walk the streets of Urgun , or the capital Shahran , it 's difficult to see how Paktika Province received such a bad reputation . Local residents crowd around visitors like long-lost relatives , and give their wish-lists of what the province needs . First : security . But they are quick to add that the problem is highway robbers and local thugs , rather than Taliban or Al Qaeda . <p> In Urgun , the local district police chief says he barely has the manpower and equipment to protect the town of Urgun itself , let alone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I do n't have enough soldiers , " says Mohammad Ghaus . " We need cars so that we can patrol , but even I do n't have one . We need radios to communicate . We do n't have guns , except our personal weapons . If I sent soldiers out to a checkpoint they would be killed by thieves , and that would have been my decision to send them to their deaths . " <p> " I spoke to the Americans about my problems , but they said , ' Our job is to catch Al Qaeda ; your job is security , ' " Mr. Ghaus adds . He laughs grimly . Later that night , Ghaus patrolled Urgun on foot , prodding his sleepy soldiers awake , armed with just a Kalashnikov . <p> Local residents here say their government was the initial cause of Paktika 's security problems . Former Gov . Muhammad Ali Jalali , a former Taliban commander who was appointed by President Hamid Karzai , was criticized for promoting his own tribe 's interests over that of the province , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government fell . Mr. Jalali was replaced just a week ago , however , and Paktika residents are giving good marks to his replacement , Gov . Gulab Mangal . <p> But the region 's reputation for insecurity has prompted most aid groups , from the United Nations to smaller private charities , to pull out of Paktika and neighboring southeastern provinces . This leaves the bulk of the development work here in the hands of the US military itself , including digging deep wells to provide clean drinking water , delivering medicines to medical clinics and hospitals , and in some instances helping Afghans build new schools . <p> In the village of Shikha , just outside of Urgun , brick masons are busy building a schoolhouse , paid for by the US military . In 50 days , the project will provide a total of eight school rooms , four for boys , four for girls , to replace a two-room schoolhouse that once served 200 students . <p> Third grader Rahmatullah ( like many Afghans , he uses only one name ) says he is grateful to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school to learn in . " In the Taliban times , we lived in Pakistan , near Wana , but we moved here last year , " says the son of a doctor . Asked what he wants to be when he grows up , he looks at his headmaster , Zarbadshah , and says , " I want to be a teacher . " <p> Haji Khair Mohammad , a landowner outside Urgun , says his friends and neighbors are " tired of the fighting , tired of the Taliban . If a mullah gets into a taxi , people tell the driver to turn on music . Even if they do n't want to listen to music themselves , they ask to play music just to annoy the mullah . " <p> Meanwhile , at the Darul Uloom Haji Kalanderia , an Islamic seminary near Urgun , Qari Mohammad Ibrahim is busy making sure that Afghanistan does not run out of mullahs . His class for memorization of the Holy Koran is packed , with students as young as 3 and as old as 20 chanting verses 10 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Taliban here , because we study the Koran , " he says , noting that the word " talib " means student in Persian . " But we are not THE Taliban . " In fact , like most people interviewed for this article , Mr. Ibrahim says he is glad that the US forces are here , and he wishes they would be able to provide for his madrassah 's many needs , including a well for drinking water , notebooks and pencils for the students , and textbooks for the most popular course : English language . <p> " Pakistan destroyed Afghanistan , so if something happened to America forces here , it would be because of Pakistan , " he says , noting that he himself attended Pakistani seminaries . <p> But while he appreciates the American presence here , Ibrahim worries that upcoming summer elections will become a threat to conservative Pashtun traditions . He is especially opposed to the registration of women , who he says should remain in their homes . It 's the same conservative Pashtun tradition that the Taliban enforced on Pashtun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one would let their women go out to vote , " he says . " I never let my wife go out to the market , so I certainly wo n't let her go outside to vote . This is not Islamic tradition and this is not Afghan tradition . If today , my wife goes out to bazaar , tomorrow she will go to the cinema . " <p> But the mullah is a flexible man . " If you want women to vote , then the election officials should come to our homes , " he says . Looking around the room , he adds , " This is my personal opinion , it is not the opinion of all the mullahs . Maybe they have other ideas . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
