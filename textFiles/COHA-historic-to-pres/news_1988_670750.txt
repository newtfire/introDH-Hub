The former president of Yale , now president of the National League and beginning next season the commissioner of baseball , sat in his Park Avenue office the other day and talked about education , literature , theater , movies and , of course , baseball. // " I used to be able to sit in the dugout during the Yale games , " he said . " I thought of it as my franchise , and they still let me do so. " // " But I obviously can ' t sit with one of the big league ball clubs or it would look like favoritism , " he said wistfully , sounding like a closet Boston Red Sox fan . Although the most frequently consulted volume on his desk these days is the Official Rules of Baseball , he continues to keep his hand in as a scholar . <> <> The Importance of Civility // A word that keeps coming up in his conversation and his book is civility . He ' s for it - on and off the playing field . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conflicting ideas in the university. // Mr. Giamatti believes that William J. Bennett , the former Secretary of Education , and Allan Bloom , the University of Chicago philosophy professor who wrote the best seller " The Closing of the American Mind , " have both been wrongheaded in their warnings against the state of American universities and the lack of emphasis on teaching the basic subjects necessary for a well-rounded education. // " Bill Bennett has been flailing the colleges for the last few years , and the tone of Professor Bloom ' s book is mean-spirited , " Mr. Giamatti said . " I don ' t think information and education are the same ; that ' s a notion that Bennett has exploited . He ' s on a mission to reform our souls . I don ' t have any problems with reformation , but these neo-Puritans make me very nervous . Bloom has been traumatized by the 60 ' s . Everyone was , but it ' s 20 years later now . He has this kind of supply-side , trickle-down theory of education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy strikes me as bizarre . " <> <> And Mr. Giamatti ' s Book // Did he consider his book a counterweight to Messrs . Bennett and Bloom ? // " Yes , but without necessarily taking them on on their own ground , " said Mr. Giamatti , who is 50 years old and lives in New Haven . " Mine is another perspective . If you read Allan Bloom , you ' d never think that the American university had any life outside the philosophy department . His view of the classics and mine are not the same . I don ' t limit a classic education to a particular list of books or subjects . The whole point of education is to have a variety of competing voices , not a single chorus . To mix a yeasty feisty debate and exchange ideas , the universities have to speak up or there will only be these other sounds. " // Mr. Giamatti ' s book , which was published by W. W. Norton , has three parts : the nature and purpose of a university , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the goals and principles of a liberal education ( he is strongly in favor of the humanities instead of emphasizing vocationalism ) , and the affiliation of the university and government , private industry and other institutions ( he says the university should follow " an independent path for the nation ' s good " ) . <> <> All the Free and Ordered Spaces // As an expert on the Renaissance , what did he think the classics had to do with the free and ordered space of the university world today ? // " The Renaissance drew upon the ancient view that the purpose of education is to create a good citizen , " Mr. Giammati said . " That is not a theme any less vital now than it was 500 years ago . The purpose was intellectual training for civil goals and a broadly educated mind - almost to toughen the mind as a muscle . This would prepare you for the problems that the world would confront you with. // " Even the act of creating a work of literature had an ethical purpose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t necessary to accept Dante ' s doctrinal religious framework , but there is a moral perspective to his writing . I ' ve always found it immensely satisfying that literature has an ethical impulse. " // Mr. Giamatti said he did not find a great difference between running Yale and the National League . In both cases , people try to fulfill their gifts in " a free and ordered space. " // " The university world is a marketplace of ideas essential to the welfare of society , " he said . " The ball park is a creative place where people come to take their pleasure by watching players doing their utmost . Wherever , you have to have a sense of order for individual freedom to exist . What always intrigued me about baseball is the relationship of the individual to the group . It ' s very much an individual sport that you play as a team member , but it isn ' t a team sport the way football is , where 11 men move on a prearranged signal . Baseball has a random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule book and flipped the pages until he found what he was looking for. // " There ' s a wonderful phrase here about the role of the umpire , " he said . " It says that his job is to maintain ' the good conduct of the game . ' It ' s almost a Renaissance phrase . I spend a lot of time talking with the umpires because they are the extension of the league on the field . I was just as worried about ' the good conduct of the game ' at Yale as here . Allowing people the freedom to behave to their potential is what you would call the glory of the game . " <> <> Baseball Books and Movies // Mr. Giamatti has read and seen some of the baseball novels and movies . His favorite is Mark Harris ' s " Bang the Drum Slowly . " He found the movie " Bull Durham " fun because it captured the flavor of the minor leagues . He liked the movie version of Bernard Malamud ' s " Natural " ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " There are marvelous histories of baseball that are really social histories of the country , " he said . " More and more I see citations used from baseball archives . The baseball records are sitting there and are a wonderful source for historians . Baseball is one of the free-standing institutions that has survived without radical changes since before the Civil War . It ' s one of the things that keeps the country together - a kind of lingua franca. " //
