THE AMERICAN REBELLION ( 658 pp. ) - Sir Henry Clinton-Edited by William B. Willcox-Yale University ( $7.50 ) . <P> Few generals can resist explaining how they happened to lose a battle . Make it a campaign or a whole war and the need becomes almost compulsive . In Sir Henry Clinton 's case , the explanation is one that ought to interest every U.S. citizen . And who was Sir Henry ? Most schoolboys know that Lord Cornwallis surrendered the British army at Yorktown , but few know that Sir Henry , the British commander in chief , left New York on the very day of the surrender with a rescuing army . <P> The rescue , of course , never came to pass , but then most of Sir Henry 's plans seldom got beyond the planning stage . That helps to explain the obscurity of the man who commanded the British armies in North America from 1778 to 1782 . In character also is the history of his painfully detailed labor of explanation , now published under the title The American Rebellion . Sir Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do since ) that the war was won not by " Mr. Washington " nor lost by Clinton , but thrown away by schemers in London and his subordinates in America . Before the book was ready for the printer , Clinton died . Now published for the first time , it seems doubtful that Englishmen of his own generation would have found it more convincing than it seems today . Simply as history , it is a fascinating look at the War of the Revolution through the eyes of a British protagonist . But it is almost equally fascinating , flossy style and all , as an unconscious giveaway of character weakness , an inadvertent confession of a general who planned much and acted little , almost passively accepted defeat from a rabble in arms and left the final explanation to his persecution complex . <P> Russians for Hessians ? Clinton , son of the Admiral Clinton who governed New York from 1743 to 1751 , liked the idea of being commander in chief of His Majesty 's armies in America but did n't care much for the responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' War he had done gallantly and risen to colonel . After that he was groom of the bedchamber to the Duke of Gloucester , was elected to Parliament , went to the Balkans to observe Catherine the Great 's Russian armies fighting the Turks ( later Clinton wanted to see Russians instead of Hessians sent to the colonies ) . By the time King George and his ministers decided to put the American colonies in their place , Clinton was an aloof major general who had never held an independent command . Wrote Clinton of himself in 1775 , " you know I am a shy bitch . "
