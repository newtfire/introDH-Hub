Among the meteorological remarks with which society has been enlivened , during the past three months , one of the most frequent has been , " This is an old-fashioned Winter , " it being taken for granted that old-fashioned Winters were remarkable for their severity . But , notwithstanding the prevalent popular impression thus appealed to , the careful investigations of- scientific men conclusively show that the Winters in former times were no colder than they are now . The last annual report of our Board of Commissioners of Public Parks contains statistics gathered from records kept in Charleston , Philadelphia , Boston , and New York , and going back in the first-mentioned of those places over one hundred and thirty years , in the second over one hundred and twenty , in the third over ninety , and in this City over fifty years . Closely calculated averages and estimates made from these records demonstrate that , although there has often been a great difference between two succeeding Winters , yet , on the whole , very cold seasons were no more frequent fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , in New-York the mean temperature of the three months , January , February , and March , for the period of five years ending with 1826 , was 33.48 ? , and for the corresponding months in the five years ending with 1871 , it was 32.73 ? . The same general truth is shown by the record of the number of days during which the Hudson has been closed by ice , and is entirely in accordance with European observation , authentic records for ea last 300 years , in regard to the time of the breaking up of the ice in some of the great rivers flowing into the Baltic and White Sea showing a strikingly similar result . There is a great tendency in youthful vision to make everything double its actual size . Any remarkable occurrence or quality is apt , in early life , to be greatly amplified by the imagination . The festal turkey to a boy of twelve is a bird of far more delectable magnitude than the man of fifty ever sees on a table . Upon a similar principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days  --  or at least there were not until the past Winter  --  as there used . to be in old times . But there is another reason quite as potent as this for people imagining that Winters were formerly colder than at present . Thirty or forty years ago , cold weather was apt to include the whole twenty-four hours of the day . Even in the best provided houses , there were always enough cold rooms and a sufficiency of cold draughts in the warm rooms , fully to remind the inmates , when the mercury was in its teens or lower , of what the temperature was outside . Now , a great many people seldom have more than an hour or two a day of Winter , and some of them still less than that . All the cold weather that large numbers of persons , especially in cities , know anything about , is just during the time they happen to be out of doors . An individual who inhabits a house heated from cellar to roof may possess a great deal of intelligence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather no small amount of theoretical knowledge . But for practical information in roger ? to meteorological phenomena , a residence in Ruch a domicile is not at all favorable . The weather of the past Winter , productive as it has been of some discomforts , has been also productive of some advantages . Among these may be enumerated that of giving such of the present youthful population as shall live for the next forty or fifty years , an opportunity of telling what kind of Winters there used to be when they were young . Tales of snow piled up in the streets of New-York so high that for weeks aged and affectionate parents failed to hear from married SORB and daughters who lived directly over the way ; stories of 150 passengers being taken out of a street-car at the terminus of the road , and laid neatly upon the ice on the sidewalk , to recover from the effects of a ride down-town , and the relation of other remarkable incidents and circumstances connected with the " old-fashioned Winters , " will afford to the then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' historical instruction .
