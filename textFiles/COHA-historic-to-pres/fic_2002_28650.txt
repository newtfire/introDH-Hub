My sister Emily was buried today . The spring sun dried the tears that ran down my cheeks . Emily 's upstairs room was the smallest in the house . On many a night her lamp burned bright until dawn , What kept Emily awake , we wondered ? Emily never went anywhere . Townsfolk thought her strange . This houseand the gardenwere her world . Emily 's writing table is bare now . Where are the sheets and scraps of paper she was always writing on ? Emily read the dictionary as others read a storybook . What did Emily find in all those words ? And here are the dresses she woreonly whitein summer and winter . But , oh ! what is this ? Poemsand poemsand even more poemsthere must be hundreds ! This , then , is what Emily was writingday and night , it must have been . " This is my letter to the World ... " This is my letter to the World That never wrote to Me The simple News that Nature told With tender Majesty Her Message is committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judgetenderlyof Me It was the brave Columbus , A sailing o'er the tide , Who notified the nations Of where I would reside ! Snow flakes . I counted till they danced so Their slippers leaped the town , And then I took a pencil To note the rebels down . And then they grew so jolly I did resign the prig , And ten of my once stately toes Are marshalled for a jig !
