THE NEUTRALS A Story MICHAEL SAYERS i i %AS not yet dark . From the eminence of Slieve Curra could be seen the wide uncultivated fields stretching as far as the sunset , a green and brown and dun vista broken only by an occasional cairn of gray heaped stones , a white thatched cottage , a stone house , and many neglected hedges . The sight was melancholy . Some spell seemed to have been laid upon this Irish midland earth , rendering it infertile ; and now , as the dew of the evening descended on grass and plant and tree , the land seemed to be weeping . A dog in a farmyard was barking , and there was the soft , tired lowing of homing cattle . Birds fluttered from hedgerow and darkening grass , rising high , silently , into the gray gloaming sky . A man with a shotgun and a cloth satchel slung from his shoulder was walking across the field toward a small whitewashed cottage whose back windows reflected the golden western sky above Slieve Curra . The man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had turned up the ends of his trousers , but the taller grasses had soaked them even so . His satchel held three dead rabbits ; the furry hind legs and tailof one of them hung limply out , bumping against the man 's hip as he walked . As he neared the cottage a young barefooted boy ran out into the back yard and , cupping his hands before his mouth , called out : " Too-hoo ! Yoo-hoo-hoo ! " The man lifted an arm and waved . He came down across the rutted cart track into the cottage back yard . The boy ran up to meet him , and caught him by the frayed sleeve of his coat . " There 's a stranger here , Da , wants to see you . " The man 's face was deeply lined and weatherbeaten . His blue eyes were clear and piercing . He stooped and moved with the slowness of a peasant . " A stranger ? " he said in slow puzzlement . " What stranger now ? " The boy raised his round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . He 's in the kitchen with mother , having tea . " He let his father walk ahead toward the back door and then ran after him into the yard . Stepping up to the door , the upper half of which was ajar , the father swung his gun and satchel off his shoulder and held them in one hand , while with the other he unlatched the lower half of the door , pushed it inward , and entered the kitchen . A pale , hatless young man in a loose trenchcoat was sitting at the table , drinking tea out of a big delft cup . A plump rosy-armed woman in a clean white apron was emptying coal from a bucket into the range . She put down the bucket as her husband came into the room . Her husband said , " Good evening , " and walked over to a corner of the room near the door and rested his gun against the wall . Coming back , he handed the weighted satchel to his wife , who held it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stooped wearily and picked up a pair of old and torn woolen slippers , and began putting them on his cold , white feet . The pale young man got up with a stiff , uncertain air . He was very thin and tall , with a desperate , undernourished look about him . His short red hair , unevenly cut , stood up on his large skull like the bristles on a broom , and there were tiny yellowish pimples about his chin and nose . His creased open trenchcoat revealed a pair of dirty flannel trousers , a frayed green pullover , a striped cotton shirt , and a stained rag of a green tie . He looked as though he had slept in his clothes . Under long blond lashes his colorless , watery eyes peered doubtfully at the older man . His host straightened up and looked at him . " Sit you down , " he said in a deep baritone which filled the low kitchen with its rich sound . " I 'll just be having a wash up while you finish your sup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am , " said the young man , still standing awkwardly . His voice was unbalanced and hesitating . " He 's a friend of Niall 's , so he is , " the woman broke in . " He says he has a letter from Niall for us . " " Ah ! " said her husband . " So you 're a friend of my son 's , are you ? And what 's your name ? " " Meader Fallon is my name . " " Well , sit you down , " said the older man again with a kinder note in his voice . " You 've traveled up from Dublin to-day ? " " I have , " said the young man . The older man would have questioned him further , but his wife put in again with an impatient cry , " Go on now and make yourself clean  --  you can talk after ! " She turned to the young man and said softly , " Finish your tea , young man , while I get a bit of supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so ? " her husband asked . He went over to the sink by one of the small windows and took off his coat as he spoke . Rolling up his shirtsleeves , he began scrubbing his big , gnarled hands under the water tap . " I came to bring you  --  a letter from your son , " the young man said abruptly . The woman went out of the kitchen and came back immediately with a clean towel which she threw over her husband 's shoulder as he stooped over the sink . " I was just saying , " she said happily , " Niall was always mad to be getting work in Dublin . He could n't stand the solitary life of the country . It 's ages since he 's been home to see his father and mother . " She was busy at the range with dishes and utensils , the talk bubbling out of her . " Ah , then , " she said , " I do sometimes wish I was out of this place myself ! The country 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing new comes in at all . " She cracked an egg into a black iron frying-pan on the range . " I was born in Dublin myself , so I was . " Her husband stood up and turned off the tap . Wiping his hands on the towel he said , " She 's always talking about how desolate the country is and reading the advertisements in the Dublin newspapers . You 'd think to hear her the country was n't good enough for her ! " " Ah , then , and it 's not good enough for any of us ! " cried the woman at the range . " In the sweat of thy brow thou shalt earn thy bread , " her husband said , and winked at the young man . " Sweat ? " said his wife . " Sweat , is it ? Sure , you and a dozen the like of you could sweat from morning to midnight for all the good it 'd do you in these parts ! " She held up the frying-pan and slid the cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-door , she called : " Stevie ! Stevie ! Your supper 's waiting ! " " A letter did you say ? " said her husband , drawing back a chair , and seating himself at the table beside his guest . The young man drew an envelope out of his inner pocket and handed it to the older man without a word . The young man seemed to be wanting to say something , but he could n't get it out . The colorless , watery eyes in his pale and narrow face never met the slow , blue gaze of the older man . The older man inspected the small blank envelope , turned it over , and opened it . His wife , with a spoon and dishcloth in her hand , came and stood behind his chair . He drew out a folded sheet of cheap , thin , lined notepaper . The young man shifted , and his tongue passed over his lips as if he were thirsty . Under the table his long , bony hands were clenched and tightly pressed between his thighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Niall : wanted you to read it , " said the young man suddenly , as if he could no longer contain himself . The woman reached up and took a jam jar down from a shelf . She picked out a pair of spectacles and handed them to her husband . He put them carefully on his nose , looping the ends over his ears , and again studied the handwriting with heavy , silent concentration . At that moment the youngster , Stevie , pushed open the door and came into the kitchen . " Shh ! " said his mother quickly before the boy could utter a sound . " There 's your supper on the table for you . " Aware that something out of the ordinary was afoot , the boy climbed quietly onto a chair and began eating his supper . MAGAZINE The father abruptly got up and went over to the door . Through the upper half the last light of the day was dimly shining . Holding the paper up to the fading light , and peering at it intently through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle of concentration , he slowly and with difficulty read his son 's letter aloud : Dear Mother and Father , I wo n't be seeing you for awhile because I 'm leaving for England to join the British Army to-night , I 've enlisted . Now do n't be worrying about me , Mother , for I 'm coming home soon and I 'll write you regularly . And I want to say this to Dad  --  I know there will be some like O'Leary in the village and other diehards like him will call me a traitor . Too few of us in Ireland yet know what 's happening in the world to-day . Those old diehards will never wake up ; they 're still wondering why the people are n't so friendly as in the Tan days , or even the Civil War period . They 'll never find out until it 's too late that the struggle has taken a new turn entirely . But what 's the use of talking , I 'm sick of talking . The time wo n't be far off when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Love to you , Mother , to Dad , and love to Stevie . Tell Stevie I 've got a knife for him and I 'll send it soon . Your Loving Son , Niall . There was very little light Ieft by now , and the man 's shoulders blocked off what little there was at the open half-door . It was very quiet in the kitchen . At last the woman stirred , lit a match and , bending over the lamp on the table , lit it and replaced the glass hood . She adjusted the wick and a bright warm yellow light flooded the room . Her husband took off his spectacles and came back to the table and sat down . " What did he want to go and do that for ? " he said , and he looked at the young man who had brought his son 's letter as if expecting an answer . But the young man was deathly pale and had nothing to say . The woman said quietly to the young man , " Well , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after your long traveling up from Dublin . " And she sighed . The young man turned his head hast-By toward her . " No , thank you , no , I 've to be back in Dublin tonight  --  I ? " " What did he want to go and join the British Army for ? " said the older man , his somber voice rising on a note of anger and bewilderment . He sat at the table beside the young man , directly across from the boy , Stevie , and he kept staring at the boy without seeing him . The boy stared back at his father , gripping his knife and fork in his small hands , his mouth open and full of food . " If he wanted to join an army what 's wrong with his own country 's army ? What 's wrong with the IRA ? " the older man went on in the same dull , angry , rising tone . " Did he go out of his mind or what ? " " The IRA ! Is that old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sharply . But her husband put his son 's letter on the table and brought his great fist down on top of it , so that the impact jarred them all , and frightened Stevie , who gaped at his father with wide scared eyes . The older man raised his head and looked at his young guest . Then suddenly he held back his shirtsleeve and thrust his bared arm under the lamplight . " Look at that arm , " he said . A long , red , ugly scar ran up the inside of his right arm where it was pale and soft . " A British soldier did that to me with a bayonet ! My son Niall saw it done , for it was done before his own eyes in this very room we 're sitting in this minute . He was only a wee baby at the time , but I told him never to forget it . I thought he never would . They tortured me in this very room , so they did ! " The old man pointed with his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right arm . " That 's what the British did to me ! " " Niall did what he thought was right , " his wife said again . " It 's not for you or anyone to set up to judge and condemn him for doing what he thinks is right . The boy has his reasons for what he 's done . " . " What reasons ? " said her husband bitterly . " In God 's name , woman , what reasons has an Irishman for joining the British Army to fight in an English war ? What did the Germans ever do to Ire-land ? " " Did n't they already drop their bombs in Dublin and was n't Mrs. Hegarty 's son Seamus blasted by the German submarine and he only fishing in his little boat ? " said his wife excitedly . " Ah , then , and perhaps it 's high time you all stopped hating the English so much and turned a bit of your attention to putting down those Nazi murderers . For that 's what they are , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had brought their son 's letter passed his tongue over his lips and began to speak in a low , rapid , and hesitating voice as if he had not heard a word the woman had said : " I tried to halt Niall from doing it , but he would n't listen to me . He said his mind was made up . I tried to argue with him , but it was no use . He said he wanted to fight ? " " Fight ? He wanted to fight ? " said the old man , staring angrily at his son 's letter on the table . " Have n't we shed enough of our Irish blood on England 's account ? Is his own country 's struggle nothing at all to him ? " " Ah , that 's enough of that now ! " his wife said passionately . " If you are n't fighting and dying for love of Ireland it 's for hatred of England ! It 's my own son 's gone from me , and that 's all I know or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near to tears . The young man got up and stood irresolutely , looking from the agitated woman to the angry old man . " I must be going  --  I ? " He moved toward the door . The woman looked at him , scarcely seeing him . He waited at the door , hesitating , his red head poised like the head of a frightened cock . " I  --  I 'm not sure of the road to the station , " he stammered , looking at the older man . The older man got up and went to the door without looking at his wife . The young man still hesitated , and then turned and went quickly outside . The older man followed him into the darkness . " Finish your bread and butter , " said the woman , left behind with the boy , Stevie . Outside , the old man and the young man walked across the yard , turned right , and down the narrow , hedge-lined road toward the village . Only a gleam of gray light was left in the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road a corn crake grated monotonously . They walked on a way in silence . At last the old man said , " You were his friend , you say . Why did he want to go and do it ? " The young man gave a short , sharp , highstrung laugh . " Just as your wife said  --  he had his reasons ! " " You were his friend , " said the old man again . " Then why did n't you stop him ? " But before the young man could say anything , he went on , " To think that my own son would he a turncoat ! It is a terrible blow to me . All my life I 've been in the movement , and it was my grandest dream that my son would take up after mc . Now what can I tell my comrades in the Army ? " The old man drew a deep breath and let it out in an angry sigh . The young man hesitated , and then he said quietly : " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose . " The old man jerked his head , and his footsteps slowed . " We joined together the year before last , just before the London bombings , " said the young man . " We did everything together . We were inseparables . . . . " The young man 's voice died off and then picked up again and wen : on : " But he 'd never listen to me . He was always headstrong . He opposed the leadership . He was against the shootings in Cork last year . He said the leadership was a pack of fools who could n't distinguish revolution from sedition , and was making the whole IRA the cat's-paw of the Nazis . I tried to argue with him . We 'd taken our oaths , I told him . But he would n't listen to me . Not your son ! " said the young man with a loud bitter cry . The young man stopped and the older man stopped too . They were away from the house and the road was shadowed by tall trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out with the confession he had pent up in himself all evening : " When Niall told me two months ago he wanted to join the British Army I tried to stop him . We sat up all night arguing , but I might as well have been talking to a stone wall for all the good it did . He would n't listen to me . I warned him what would happen . I told him there 'd be a court-martial and he 'd be called a traitor . He would n't pay any attention to me . Then they found out what he 'd done , and they told me I must stop him . . . . I 'd brought him into the IRA originally , and so I was responsible for him . . . I told him what the orders were . He 'd be shot as a deserter . . . God knows , I was Niall 's friend . I loved him . . . . Yesterday I reported to the Commandant , and he told me I 'd have to break the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible , and that 's the rule of the Army . " The young man 's high voice broke . Huskily , he said : " I  --  Niall was shot three days ago . We buried him in a field near Terenure . " The young mart was breathing heavily in the darkness . He struggled with something in his coat pocket . He brought it out and the older man felt something heavy wrapped in cloth being pressed into his hand . It was a small bundle of things wrapped in a handkerchief . " They 're Niall 's . . things . " The older man held the bundle , wondering , slow to grasp the meaning of this on top of all the words . " He wanted you to have them . He told me before he died . " The older man stood there , holding the bundle in his big hand , and the words sank into his slow mind . The younger man 's panting grew louder and more rapid . " He was my best friend . God forgive me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak , indecisive hand and touched the older man 's chest , but as soon as he felt it the young man drew back his hand as though he had touched something burning hot . He gave a queer strangled gasp and stepped back , and then he suddenly began running down the dark road . The older man heard his rapid footsteps . He heard the young man stumble and fall heavily face forward on the dark road . He heard the young man scram-bling to his feet . Only then the older man 's numbed mind awoke . " Stop ! Come back ! " he roared into the darkness . " Come back ! " And then in a terrible voice he screamed after the young man : " ur der er ! " But the young man had picked himself up and was running away . The older man still stood there in the roadway , grasping the small bundle in his big , gnarled hand . The sound of the young man 's running feet had died away , and the older man still stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S IDEAS ON MANPOWER , 1931 - 41. - We have heard a good deal of a slogan : " Draft every dollar , every thing , and every man .
