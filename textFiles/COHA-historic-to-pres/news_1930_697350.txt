The demand made upon Governor ROOSEVELT by Alderman BALDWIN that an investigation of the Mayor 's office be ordered was probably not intended to be taken seriously . It was merely thought to be a good chance , to score a few points against the Walker Administration . Not even this was done effectively in all respects , certainly not always with good taste . But we know that at the City Hall when politics enters the door politeness jumps out of the window . Mayor WALKER 'S own sarcastic comments on Mr. BALDWIN were a fair enough retort to this kind of attack . To arraign Mayor WALKER as the source and responsible cause of all the scandals that have broken out in any borough of the city , or in any department of the municipal government , is rather a case of political ambition o'erleaping , itself and falling on t' other side . By this time Mr. BALDWIN and everybody else who has closely followed the public course of Mayor WALKER ought to understand that such official defects as he has exhibited could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No Moreland Commissioner , no committee of the Legislature , can analyze and classify the intangible thing which we call morale . There is something in the spirit of most administrative officials which is too subtle and evanescent for an inquiry to be able to pin down in a black-andwhite tabulation . A grievous lack in that respect may be very harmful and demoralizing , but it can not be definitely located . Yet just here , as even friendly observers of the Walker Administration realize , has it been most vulnerable . It may not be possible to bring specific wrongdoing home to the Mayor 's office , but an impalpable kind of wrong acting may come from it as a bad influence on the entire public service of the city . If the Mayor is too casual and flippant in the discharge of his duties ; if he fails to keep regular hours ; if mysterious absences are too common ; if even his own Commissioners , to say nothing of citizens with a legitimate interest in some public affair , are not able to make appointments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of the day than prompt decisions  --  everybody can see how these things work injury to the conduct of the public business in New York City . But how could any investigator , how could the sharpest counsel to a legislative committee , strike his hand upon this spot and say : " Thou ailest here and here " ? Nevertheless , without investigation or specific exposure or emphasis , such official tendencies and ? displays , if long maintained , carry their own adverse impression to the public and diffuse laxity through the departments . They can not be precisely reported , but they are felt by all to be in the atmosphere . Even when not distilled out of it in a definite way , they have their bad effect . This is the thing which Mayor WALKER has most to fear , as it affects the regard in which he is held for his agreeable personal qualities , and the reputation which he desires to leave behind him with his fellowcitizens , and it is also the thing which it is to be hoped he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
