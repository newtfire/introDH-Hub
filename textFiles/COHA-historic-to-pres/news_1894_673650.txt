The work of extending the Commercial Cable from its old landing place on Coney Island was completed yesterday . The first section of the new line was brought through the shoal waters of Gravesend Bay Saturday afternoon , and the end buoyed in deep water there . The company 's steamship , the MackayBennett , picked up the buoyed end early yesterday morning , and , after another section had been spliced to the cable , the vessel proceeded up the bay with her big reels clanking and the cable paying out astern . The vessel reached Pier A without accident and made the ends of the cable fast to the piles about the pier . When that work was completed the ship swung out into the stream and went to an anchorage off Liberty Island . She will go to a berth alongside the American Line pier to-day .
