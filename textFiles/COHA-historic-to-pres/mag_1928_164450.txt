Exhorted E. S. Shoaf , manager of the Jennings , La. , Chamber of Commerce : " Rice , which is the principal food of more than one-third of the world 's population , does not occupy its rightful place on the menu of the American family simply because rice-growers and millers have not properly advertised their product . Its nutritive value is great compared to that of other common foods . " Mr. Shoaf was addressing a conference of rice-growers and millers of the three principal rice-growing states ( Arkansas , Texas and Louisiana ) , meeting last week in New Orleans . They talked about the need for advertising in order to market effectively their annual output of 6,500,000 barrels of rice ; planned an aggressive campaign to make the nation rice-conscious . Last week they met again in Jennings and talked about the same .
