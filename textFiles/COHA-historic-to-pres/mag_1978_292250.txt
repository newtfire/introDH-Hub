Henceforth , promises Bert Lance , he will do no wrong <P> As he rose from a $90-per-week bank teller to millionaire bank president , Bert Lance never forgot his friends-or his poor relations . Between 1963 and 1974 , while he was president of the First National Bank in Calhoun , Ga . ( pop . 6,000 ) , he arranged five loans totaling about $140,000 for his unemployed mother-in-law , Ruth M. Chance . When the interest payments were due , Lance sometimes wrote checks on her overdrawn Calhoun account to make the payments . He also arranged loans , and made similar repayments , for three brothers-in-law : a total of $57,982 to retired Naval Officer Frank M. McAfee ; $180,820 to School Administrator Beverly David , who apparently committed suicide in 1974 ; and $214,000 to sometime Florist Claude David . There were also overdrafts and accompanying loans of $88,000 to Wife LaBelle and of $99,236 to Son David , who was in his late teens at the time . <P> So grateful were the relatives for Lance 's help that LaBelle and Brother-in-Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Nest on the Lance farm as a gift to Bert . To pay for the work , Claude wrote $40,000 in checks on his already overdrawn Calhoun checking account . <P> These family financial dealings were among those alleged in a civil suit filed in U.S. district court last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Comptroller of the Currency . The borrowing arose , said the examiners , because a number of Lance 's relatives " were experiencing extreme financial difficulties and needed additional funds to meet living expenses . " The sweeping , 90-page complaint was the final act in the agencies ' seven-month investigation of Lance , the Calhoun bank and the National Bank of Georgia ( NBG ) , which Lance headed in 1975 and 1976 . The investigation began shortly before he resigned last September as Jimmy Carter 's Director of Management and Budget . <P> In addition to Lance 's irregular way of helping his relatives , the federal agencies said they found evidence of misleading and inaccurate bank record keeping , questionable loans to bank officers and friends , overstatements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that Lance inflated his net worth by up to $1,409,779 in applying for loans from his own banks and others . The investigators also found that Lance used an NBG airplane , which cost $223,180 to operate from 1975 through 1977 , during which Lance and other bank officials flew on 1,373 trips . But the bank could only produce records indicating that 259 of the trips were for business purposes . <P> The federal examiners called the irregularities " unsafe and unsound " banking practices . For failing to disclose them to stockholders , the examiners accused Lance and the banks of " fraud and deceit . " Lance and the banks admitted no wrongdoing . Indeed , Lance in the past has blamed part of his troubles on " careless , erroneous or biased reporting " by the press . But he and the banks signed a consent decree , promising not to commit these kinds of questionable acts in the future . The decree bars Lance from ever again bouncing a check except in an " isolated and inadvertent " case . In addition , Lance agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming control of a bank .
