From all over the countryside they descended on Peking last week-swarms of muscular women in tight pigtails , laborers ' boots and identical blue boiler suits . The glorious revolution , said Madame Soong Ching-ling , U.S.-educated* widow of Sun Yat-sen and now People 's Vice Chairman , had brought about a great change in Chinese " esthetic views . . . The fragile , slender and sentimental girls , whom the exploiting classes regarded as pretty , are ugly and degenerate to the working people . " Banners flaunted high , red-and-gold streamers clutched in their hands , the emancipated women of Red China cried back their full-throated approval : " What was beautiful is now ugly ! What was ugly is now beautiful ! " It was International Women 's Day , and no fewer than 10,000 Hero Women and members of Women 's Groups were on hand for the big rally . There was Hsu Hsueh-hui , who lost both hands " in a fight with Kuomintang bandits " and now wears an artificial pair made in the Soviet Union " especially for shaking hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The party made a pilot of me , a 32-year-old peasant girl " ) was there , and so were the " Seven Fairies " of the Hupeh tea plantation , who had found a way to pick 1,102 Ibs. of tea leaves a day . " All sisters in our country , " cried the chairman of the National Women 's Federation , " spur your horses again and again ! " <P> " Do Good . " Ever since 1950 , when the Communists decreed them equal to men , the women of Red China have been spurring . Today nine out of ten of them have jobs , and when they get together , boasts the weekly Women of China , they " do not gossip any more , but talk about how to accomplish their production task . " When that subject palls , they switch to discussing the Five Goods ( e.g. , " Do good in self-study " ) , and after that , the Seven Stills ( " Some women still indulge themselves in ideas of conservatism , self-abasement and dependency " ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change-the eager women of the militia , the emaciated girls toiling in the communes as if possessed . To some recent foreign travelers to Communist China , the most striking thing about the women is the pleasure they take in power : they are the real militants of the new order . <P> They may work for only $4 a week and have their children brought up in factory nurseries . But they themselves stay around the factory after hours searching for some improvement to be made-or someone to denounce . Expelled priests and escaped deviationists report with remembered horror on the teen-age girls screaming for their executions , or serving as their fanatic inquisitors . <P> Men Shoppers . In fact , the Communists seem to be erecting a new matriarchy . Two weeks ago 80 million women were " organized " to see the new film , Silver Blossoms in the Sky , the story of China 's female paratroopers . And in Shanghai , Peking and Canton , one Swiss traveler observed the weirdest sight of all-long lines of dutiful men who had been sent out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , for the markets to open .
