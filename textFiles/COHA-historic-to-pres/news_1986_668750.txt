An FBI agent testified in federal court Wednesday that he delivered $3 , 500 in cash bribes to Lt. James Keating of the Cook County sheriff ' s police during five meetings in 1982 and 1983 to provide for protection of an illegal offtrack horse race betting business secretly operated by the FBI in Palatine Township . Lary Damron , who used the alias " Lary Wright , " while posing undercover as the owner of a service that processed credit-card billings for massage parlors , testified that an additional $2 , 400 was delivered to Keating through intermediaries . Damron said that after a series of phone calls beginning in July , 1982 , he met Keating for the first time on Sept. 3 in a Holiday Inn restaurant at the Ford City shopping center . " I told him I had the money for the month and I asked him if he wanted it then or wanted it later , " Damron said . " I gave him the money , he took it and put it in his pocket . " Under questioning by Jeffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Strike Force Against Organized Crime , Damron said he began paying $600 a month for protection beginning in May , 1982 . The money was paid at first through Joseph Marren , described by Johnson and co-prosecutor David Stetler as Keating ' s " bagman . " When Marren was sent to prison on an unrelated conviction in the summer of 1982 , arrangements were made to deliver the money to the Holiday Inn lounge , where it was handed over to a waitress who acted as an intermediary , Damron said . However , in late August , 1982 , Keating agreed to meet him personally to get the money and discuss other matters , Damron said . Damron told a jury in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge James Holderman that at the first meeting he handed six $100 bills across the table . Keating " took it in his hand  --  he had a windbreaker on  --  and he put it in his pocket , " Damron said Keating , 48 , former head of the sheriff ' s police intelligence unit , is on trial on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sgt. Bruce Frasch , 39 , former commander of the department ' s vice unit . The charges resulted from the FBI ' s Operation Safebet investigation . Johnson and Stetler have accused the defendants of taking thousands of dollars in bribes to overlook gambling and prostitution in unincorporated areas of Cook County . Damron testified that he was connected to Keating through Marren , 46 , of Willow Springs , who worked as a manager at Michael ' s Magic Touch , a club featuring nude dancers , at 8528 Ogden Ave . , Lyons . It was Marren who introduced Damron to the Holiday Inn waitress and set up a monthly delivery plan , explaining that the bills should be wrapped in newspaper and stuffed in an envelope so that a casual observer would not be able to determine that the envelope contained cash , Dam-ron testified . During a telephone conversation between Keating and Damron that was recorded and played for the jury , Keating said he had delivered some of the payoff money to the commissary account at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago where Marren was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Keating remarked on the recording and Damron can be heard laughing and replying , " He ' ll love it . He ' ll love it . " Damron then asked Keating if any sheriff ' s police officers were investigating any of his businesses and Keating said , " I don ' t like your phone . . . why don ' t I call you Monday and I ' ll give you a phone number . . . and you go to another phone and call me . " Damron said he would use a pay phone and Keating replied , " OK , never use the same one twice . " On Sept. 2 , 1982 , Keating called Damron to arrange the meeting at the Holiday Inn , according to testimony . " He agreed that he would meet with me . He said he ' d be easy to spot because he was as big as a squadrol , " Damron said . Damron said he next met Keating at a restaurant in Chicago on Oct. 25 , 1982 , and handed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly protection payoff and $200 was " like a bonus . " The two did not meet again until Nov. 27 , when they sat down together at the Holiday Inn lounge at Ford City . At that meeting Damron said he handed over $1 , 200 in cash to Keating , representing protection payments for November and December . During that meeting , Damron told Keating that he was setting up a money- laundering scheme in the Grand Cayman Islands . Damron testified that Keating offered to " to help us transport the cash if we needed it . " When Damron said he might need phony identification , Keating suggested he visit a graveyard and find a tombstone of a young child " and go to get the death records and build identification from there so it wouldn ' t come back " on him . Herbert Barsy and Lawrence Morrissey , attorneys for Keating , objected to that testimony as irrelevant and Holderman ordered the jury to disregard it . Damron said he met Keating on Dec. 26 in the Holiday Inn and delivered a $300 " Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to Marren , who was out of jail on a vacation furlough . His final meeting with Keating was on Jan. 20 , 1983 , in the Holiday Inn , where Damron said he passed $600 in cash to Keating . Damron said the betting parlor was closed down in late February and no further payoffs were made . CAPTION : PHOTO : Sheriff ' s Lt. James Keating . Illustration PHOTO <>
