Into the office of Franklin D. Roosevelt one day last week filed a hundred-odd Washington correspondents , for the President 's usual bi-weekly press conference . As usual , the reporters fell into two groups : 1 ) those assigned exclusively to cover President Roosevelt 's activities , 2 ) other correspondents and their newspaper friends . Members of the first group drifted toward the front of the room , as usual , and as usual the United Press 's tremendous Fred Storm lowered himself into his special chair so that those in the rear could see past him . Franklin Roosevelt gripped a long cigaret holder in his jaw , as he almost always does . <P> But the President 's jaw was set hard and Franklin Roosevelt did not grin at his interviewers . Most of the correspondents looked uncomfortable . The room was quiet as a church . The President broke the silence , made his announcement on neutrality . The questions asked him were terse and sober ; his replies were concise . Not a word did Franklin Roosevelt say to Fred Storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. to work for Sam Goldwyn and Jimmy Roosevelt in Hollywood . When the conference was over the newspapermen filed out as quietly as they had entered , and everybody knew that , for a time at least , a new atmosphere existed between the President and the Press . <P> It would not have been in good taste for Franklin Roosevelt to mention Fred Storm 's new job publicly , either to congratulate him or commiserate with him on leaving U. P. For only the day before , for the first time in history , a President of the U. S. , in a written statement , had accused a press association of sending out a story that was " wholly false . " The association was United Press . Facts in the case were these : <P> Two days before , Ronald G. Van Tine of the U. P. had been told by a Senator ( whom he refused to name ) that the President was " hopping mad " over the shelving of his Neutrality Bill , that Secretary Hull was urging him not to send a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grattan P. McGroarty had got similar news at the State Department . Correspondents Van Tine and McGroarty sent out a story , under Van Tine 's signature , beginning : " President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull were reported in Administration quarters today to have disagreed on the language of a neutrality message the President plans to send to Congress . " The Washington Times-Herald printed the story under an eight-column headline : <P> NEUTRALITY NOTE SPLITS F. D. , HULL <P> Cold with anger , Franklin Roosevelt sat down and dictated a statement , denying that he and Cordell Hull had yet decided what to do next about neutrality , giving U. P. a piece of his mind . Excerpts : <P> " The headline is , of course , wholly false ; so is the story . . . . The United Press has been guilty of a falsification of the actual facts . If called upon to give the source of the information , they will decline to give it . ... The fact remains that the story is contrary to every fact . ... I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a culmination of other false news stories to which the attention of the United Press has been called by me and by my office on previous occasions . . . . This latest episode . . . represents the limit of any decent person 's patience . ... "
