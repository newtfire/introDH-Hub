Soviet military buildup worries leading U.S. defense experts <P> " We face a challenge , and we will do whatever is necessary to meet it . " So vowed Jimmy Carter in a major statement on U.S. defense policy earlier this month . Exactly what needs to be done-and what will be done-is not clear , however . Even the nature of the challenge from the Soviet Union is in dispute . Every day , behind the doors of congressional committee rooms , experts argue about how much the U.S. must spend to protect itself and how these vast sums ( more than $115 billion in the current budget ) can be best used . <P> To analyze and explain these complex controversies . TIME invited five of the nation 's leading defense experts ( see box ) to a daylong National Security Issues Round Table at the Time &; Life Building in Manhattan . While the analysts represented some widely divergent views , they generally agreed on a number of key matters : <P> &gt;The Soviet Union 's continuing nuclear and conventional military buildup is increasingly ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterred nuclear war . <P> &gt;Disarmament negotiations like the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ( SALT ) may not be capable , by themselves , of preserving this U.S.-U.S.S.R. balance . <P> &gt;The U.S. may be hampered by a lack of creative strategic thinking . <P> Dominating the experts ' discussions - as indeed it does all U.S. military planning-was the specter of the Soviet nuclear buildup . In 1965 the U.S. enjoyed about a 4-to-1 lead over the Soviets in strategic nuclear missiles ; today the Soviets deploy 1,477 land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMS ) , compared with 1,054 for the U.S. , and the Russian lead in submarine-launched nuclear weapons is 909. v. 656 . The main American advantages remain in its bombers ( 417. v. 140 ) . the accuracy of its missiles and the number of warheads ( 9,000 , v. 4,000 ) . But many of these warheads may become vulnerable to destruction by a Soviet attack in the mid-1980s if Moscow improves and deploys large numbers of the SS-18 and SS-19 missiles that it is now testing . Declared William Hyland : " We are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gap between our capabilities to gain some advantage by striking first and Soviet capabilities to do so seems to be growing . " The gap is also widening in defensive deterrence , according to John Collins . The Soviets , he noted , stress civil defense and maintain an extensive antiaircraft network , while the U.S. does not . He added : " We repudiate strategic defense of the homeland and rely solely on an offensive deterrence . " <P> Barry Blechman cautioned , however , that the numbers in themselves can exaggerate the Soviet threat . " Their military power is very troubling , and I 'm not saying that we should discount it , " he explained , " but I certainly would n't throw up my hands in despair and say that we will be on the losing end . " The U.S. spends a great deal on readiness , for example . " We keep roughly half our strategic submarines at sea at all times , where they can hit their targets , but only about 15% of Soviet subs are on station . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
