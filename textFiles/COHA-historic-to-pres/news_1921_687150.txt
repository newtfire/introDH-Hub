" The presiding officer will then deliver an address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on program and procedure , it will be proposed that the conference adjourn to meet on Tuesday , Nov. 15 , 11 A.- M. at Continental Memorial Hall . " Two Main Committees . There will be two committees on program and procedure , one to deal with the limitation of armaments and the other ' with Pacific and Far Eastern questions . The former committee will be composed of the heads of the five principal delegations , those of Great Britain , France , Japan , Italy and the United States . The latter committee will include , in addition to the five named , the heads of the four other delegations invited to participate in discussions of Pacific and Far Eastern question  --  China , The Netherlands , Portugal and Belgium . ? Adjournment will be taken from Saturday to Tuesday , instead of Monday , in order to give the two committees which are to play so important a part in the conference an opportunity to get together and reconcile any conflicting opinions that Nay be held as to the scope which the conference shall take . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be accomplished by Tuesday and that reports can be prepared which may be used as a working basis at least for the early deliberations . The public meetings are to be held in Continental Memorial Hall on Seventeenth Street . When plans were first made for the conference it was proposed to hold the public sessions in the Hall of the Americas in the Pan American Building , but it was found to be impossible to provide sufficient accommodations there for resident diplomats , the Cabinet , members of the Senate and House , the army of newspaper correspondents who have come to Washington , many from far distant points , and others to whom it was considered essential to extend invitations . The Memorial Hall will seat about 1,300 and the Governments have stressed the desire for full publicity by allotting 270 of these seats in the most desirable part of the hall , on the main floor , to the foreign and American press . About 840 of the seats are in the palcony of the hall . There are also four boxes , one of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American delegation and two to the foreign delegations . The aelegates of the five principal powers will sit about a table . The Anierican delegation will occupy the seats at the head of this ' table , and right and left , in alphabetical order , will be the delegates of France , Great 1:1 ? ritain , Italy and Japan . The delegates of the four other powers will have seats facing the American delegation . The table about which these ? delegates will sit has a covering of green cloth . The addresses which are to be deliverecl  --  by President Harding and Secretary Hughes at the meeting on Saturday are being awaited with- unusual interest . It is not believed that either of them will go to any great extent into the problems involved in the conference , but there is a belief that they will speak frankly on the general attitude of America toward the delib'eratinns and the hope of bringing about limitation of armaments . Whatever the results of the conference may be . there has been little left to hope for in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Navy Building , the Pan-American ? Building and the building of the Daughters , of the American Revolution have been turned over to the conferees . In the Navy Building there have been equipped private - offices for , each member of each delegation , council rooms for those delegations which desired them , - quarters for the small army of technical experts and advisers and commodious quarters for the press and the telegraph and telephone services . Contact With Foreign Writers . The newspaper correspondents nave been provided with a large workroom and a large reception room , where it is hoped that the correspondents of - the foreign - nations , arid the United States will be daily in contact with one ' another . ' Those who had the arrangements in hand believed that such a plan would t , romote good feeling and understanding among the correspondents .

Some of them , hazarding a guess , have fixed six months as the time ; others have said three or four ' months ? but all have made it plain that they had not the slightest definite idea on the subs ject . Since the delegates have been gathering , however , it has become manifest that the whole disposition will be to shorten the time . Even officials of the United States are now inclined to think that the two monhs ' estimate will fully cover the life of the assembly . Opinion is tending toward having the conference finish its fundamental work in less than two months , and a general idea seems to exist that there may be an adjournment by Christmas , or six weeks after the opening session . Bryand to Remain Two Weeks . M. Briand , the Premier of ? France , plans to sail for Europe in about ? two weeks after the conference begins .. A considerable number of European public men attending the conference are anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be necessary for them to return to America . This state of affairs is regarded as a hopeful sign for conference success . It is capable of the construction that those concerned do not believe that the problems are insuperable . This way of looking at the situation is not in accord . however , with the considerable pessimim which prevails among many individuals connected-with the gathering . One suggestion supposed to emanate from some important source is that the main conference should devote itself to mapping out a series of general principles , leaving separate committees to work out formulae Which will fit them , the committees to repOrt , in due time and their recommendation 'S to be taken up by the nations concerned through diplomatic channels . Whether there will be an , serious attention given to this suggestion is not known , but the desire for an early adjournment lends color to it .

In addition to these two large rooms , quarters have been provided for the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a press headquarters in the building of the Daughters of the American Revolution . ' The telegraph facilities will be ample . The Western Union has . put in an equipment in the Navy Building over which , if necessary , more than 2,000,000 words can be handled in a day of ten hours . It also has two direct cable circuits to Nova Scotia and two to San Francisco from the Navy Building . This equipment is in addition to the large central office at which the facilities which were established during the war are still available . The Postal Company also has put ? in a special equipment in the Navy Building and both companies are predicting quick service without regard to the volume of dispatches . The Pan American building will be used by the delegates for ' their private conferences . The Hall of the Americas has been turned over for a general conference room and there are smaller council rooms at each end . The task of refitting all of the buildings for the purposes of the conference was turned over to Lieut . Commander Rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conference beyond Saturday 's meeting . It is probable ' that the meeting to be held on Tuesday morning will be public , but no definite decision will , be made as to this before the cOmmittees are ready to report . Hope to Finish by Christmas . One of the striking developments or the pre-conference period is a general inclination to believe that the gathering will be short-lived . This does not mean that its participants expect it to end in failure soon but merely that the general disposition is to speed the work so that busy statesmen will be able to return to their duties within a time measured by weeks instead of months . In the interim between the calling of the ? conference and the assembling of the delegates and their staffs in . Washington . it has been anybody 's guess as to how long the conference would last .
