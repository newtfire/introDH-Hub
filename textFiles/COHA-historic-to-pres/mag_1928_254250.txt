NICOLO MACHIAVELLI , The Florentine-Giuseppi Prezzolini-Brentano ( $3.50 ) . <P> Machiavelli has become little more than an adjective signifying ruthless scheming duplicity . The present biography makes it quite clear that a man is behind the adjective , a true Florentine who slung mud and cobble stones in street-fights along the Arno , swapped bawdy yarns over a noggin of wine , curried favor with whatever political power there happened to be . <P> The Man with a curled lip , Nicolo Machiavelli , watched the puss-in-the-corner competition of petty princes , watched hired captains of mercenaries scheming to prolong their lucrative warfare , watched Ludovico break the unwritten rule of the game and call in Charles VIII , Foreigner , to settle a local dispute , while all Italians smiled , bowed , tossed flowers in the French king 's path , stones in his wake . With still more of a curl to his lip , Nicolo watched Savonarola hypnotizing the garish Florentine crowds into demure god-fearing citizenry , and the street gamins into veritable " boyscouts of the Lord . " He suspected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colorful sermons that so inspired a people who felt , but understood nothing . <P> In 1498 Nicolo was elected by the Grand Council Secretary of the Republic of Florence , a lowlier post than the sound of it . For 14 years he compiled minutes , addressed envelopes , jogged ahorseback on 23 insignificant missions abroad , to say nothing of countless trips on domestic matters . Wherever he went he gleaned bits of information which he fitted into his political philosophy . <P> Of all the personages he encountered on these wanderings-prelates , merchants , scholars-the most significant was Caesar Borgia , whose unscrupulous diplomacy Nicolo observed , admired , immortalized in The Prince , treatise of political theory . <P> Meanwhile the futility of hired soldiers preyed upon Machiavelli 's thoughts . By dint of pulling every known string , he was authorized to organize a national conscription similar to the system he had noted in <P> Switzerland . At the test of fire it proved a dismal failure . <P> With the ascendancy of the Medicis , Nicolo lost his job , was accused of plotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villa . Here he was reduced to the boorish society of the pot-house-backgammon and trie trac with butcher and furnace-makers replaced learned converse with the intellectuals of Florence . Though he filled much of his time with wine , women , and oaths , he was forced out of sheer boredom to pore long hours over his beloved Latin-history , comedy , philosophy ( translated from the Greek ) - and set down his own political philosophy ( The Prince , The Discourses ) , his own broad humor ( Mandragola ) . <P> The Significance . In consciously picturesque manner , Author Prezzolini quickens hazy impressions of the man Machiavelli , details a rather commonplace life in a rich setting of mediaeval Florence , declares nothing too trivial to report of so great a man . But the essence of that greatness , to wit , the political theory which influenced Napoleon , Mussolini , remains unanalyzed but for the textbook generalities.
