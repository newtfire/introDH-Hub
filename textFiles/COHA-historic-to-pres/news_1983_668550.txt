Now , you knew Holy Cross ' s 21-18 win over Colgate was a big one , but you might not have known in how many ways . For starters , it was particularly big for Crusader backup quarterback Tom Heffernan , who replaced Peter Muldoon ( hip pointer ) in the fourth quarter and marched his team 70 yards in just three plays ( with his 20-yard TD pass to Bill Cowley and his own sneak-n- peak , two-point conversion capping the drive ) . Aside from the fact it was Heffernan ' s most significant accomplishment with the Purple , it was also his chance to unload a heavy albatross he ' s been wearing since the last time the Cross played Colgate . In that game , Heffernan replaced an injured Muldoon with HC ahead , but couldn ' t get the offense moving . Eventually the Red Raiders took that one away , 21-17 . You see , it ' s been five years since the Crusaders beat Colgate . Which is another reason why this was a biggie - Rick Carter has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the Cross except one - Boston College . " This was the most pleasing win , it had everything you could ask for in acollege football game , " said Carter . " And with only 10 or so undefeated teams left in our division , we ' ve become part of a special and select group . " Holy Cross will be looking for its sixth straight win at UConn Saturday . Muldoon is healthy and will be the starting quarterback . Is Northeastern for real ? Yes , claims coach Paul Pawlak , in spite of Saturday ' s 30-10 loss to Rhode Island . " I was upset we allowed the score to stretch out at the end , " he said . " We were tied with them until the end of the third quarter . It was not a 30-10 game . " This week the Huskies are at AIC , a Division 2 team that has been a pesky opponent for NU , especially on the road . The Yellow Jackets nearly upset NU two years ago before Brian Snow kicked a 52-yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t care if AIC is a Division 2 team , I expect our players to understand the importance of each game , " said Pawlak . " We are a 3- 2 team and I expect us to act like one . " Chuck Colombo guided Harvard past Columbia and Brian White saved the Crimson from a near-disastrous loss to Cornell , but which of the two will start at quarterback against Dartmouth Saturday ? Harvard coach Joe Restic said he ' ll make that decision at the end of the week . " Dartmouth is our season , " he said . " They have a great team with balance on both sides . They have to win and we have to win . This is the big one . " Dartmouth is 1-0 in Ivy League play , but 1-3 overall following last week ' s 21-17 loss to William &; Mary , in which the Big Green blew a 17-0 lead . Should there be any doubt concerning BU ' s game plan for its Yankee Conference showdown with Rhode Island this Saturday , please look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond . Gold Helmet winner Paul Lewis hopscotched his way to 223 yards and 3 TDs , while fullback Rodney Graham bulldozed for a career-high 94 yards . " Lewis was just exceptional , but a lot of that credit should also go to the offensive line and the fullbacks , " said BU coach Rick Taylor . URI ( 4-1 ) , behind quarterback Dave Wienke , has favored an air attack this season . The Rams travel to Boston with a four-game winning streak.
