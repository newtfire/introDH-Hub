A tour of the Minneapolis , Minn. , riverfront and such historic landmarks as the Stone Arch Bridge and the Mill City Museum can take a lot of time and shoe leather . But Bill and Emily Neuenschwander 's tours can guide you through much of the city 's history quickly , with a nod to the future : the mode of transportation is the Segway Human Transporter . The Neuenschwanders started offering tours via the scooter-like device this spring as a sideline to their computer-consulting business . Now they have a fleet of 21 Segways and are attracting 150 customers a week , who pay $69.95 for the three-hour tour . It starts with a quick safety and riding lesson for those who have never used a Segway , then covers five to seven miles of town , with running commentary via a radio on the handlebars . On a recent trip to Minneapolis , Katrina Patterson , 37 , of San Jose , Calif. , booked a tour for her family , including two young sons . " Because they were on a Segway , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was the highlight of their trip . " <P> Segway sightseeing is catching on around the world . David Mebane , 28 , added a Segway tour to his repertoire of bike tours of Paris last year . It has been so successful that he now offers a similar tour of Nice and plans to expand into Chicago and New Orleans this summer . " The growth has been really quick and unbelievable , " says Mebane . It 's also not a bad bit of promotion for Segway , which has sold relatively few of the space-age transporters since introducing them in 2002 . " Tour groups have definitely raised the awareness and familiarity people have with the Segway , " says spokeswoman Carla Vallone . <P>  --  By Sarah Sturmon Dale
