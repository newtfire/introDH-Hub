The Air Mail made a profit of over $500 on the first night mail trip from San Francisco to New York . $2,308.48 was paid for more than 8,000 pieces of mail and at 66 a mile , which is the average figure for cost of flying operation , the Government realized $539.68 profit . There is no doubt the service can pay for itself-if the first great burst of business due to curiosity and sentiment does not fall off . <P> But the Air Mail does not insure its ships . Frank Yager , flying from Cheyenne , Wyo. , was bruised , and his plane was wrecked by a hurricane , which forced him to land at Chappell , Neb.
