A LARGE room , beyond which is visible , in varying degrees of light and movement , infinite space . Sun , moon , planets , stars , constellations , and so on . The room is one of many . It is The American Room , and is so marked . Each person here has been conceived and is waiting to be born . Each possesses his ultimate physical form and ego . Ultimate , that is , in the sense that here , in this waiting room , he is the way he shall be the day he begins to die , or the day he dies , in the world . The faces of the unconceived appear to be a white cloud of a summer afternoon . A solemn but witty VOICE speaks . THE VOICE O.K. , people . Your time has come . You are now going to enter the world . You 'll find it a strange place . There are no instructions . You know your destiny now , but the moment you are in the world , breathing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me tell you . Good things , and bad , are ahead for each of you . The world is still new , and the idea of sending you out there for a visit has not yet proved itself to be a good one . It may in time , though . Your destination is America . ( A phrase of patriotic music ) It 's an interesting place . No better and no worse than any other place , except of course superficially , which the Americans make a good deal of , one way or the other . The climate 's fair everywhere , excellent here and there . Everything you do , you shall imagine is your own doing . You can thank God for that , too . You shall live as long as you shall . No more . You will find noise and confusion everywhere , even in your sleep . Sometimes in sleep , however , you shall almost , but not quite , return to this place . Nothing in the world is important . Nothing is unimportant . Many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment you shall begin to be human . You have waited here nine months of the world 's time . A few of you a little less . From now on you shall be alone in body , apparently cut off from everything . You shall also seem to be alone in spirit . That , however , is an illusion . Each of you is the continuation of two others , each of whom was a continuation of two others , each of whom  --  and so on . ( Blithely ) I could go on talking for two or three years , but it would n't mean anything . O.K. , now , here you go ! Take a deep breath ! ( Dramatically ) Hold it ! You will exhale in the world . O.K. , Joe , let ' em out ! ( A few chords of music . Some PEOPLE go out . BUTCH , a boy of nine , and MR . CARROLL , a man of seventy , come in . BUTCH is thoughtfully bouncing an old tennis ball ) p. 3 BUTCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like the idea of being born ? CARROL Why , yes , of course , Butch . There 's nothing like getting born and being alive . BUTCH I do n't know whether I 'm lucky or unlucky . Steve says I 'm lucky because I do n't have to stay in the world very long , and Miss Quickly  --  she says it ai n't fair . CARROL What ai n't ? BUTCH Me having to get born , just for nine years . Before I get a chance to turn around I 'll have to come back , so what 's the use going ? I 'm the way I 'm going to be when I die , and you 're the way you 're going to be when you die . I 'm nine , and you 're an old man . CARROL Butch , my boy , those nine years are going to be wonderful . BUTCH Maybe . Miss Quickly says it 'll take me five or six years just to begin . Gosh , that only leaves three . I wo n't even get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARROL Maybe you will . BUTCH Heck no . How am I going to get from a little town in Texas to New York ? CARROL It may happen . BUTCH Boy , I hope it does , but Miss Quickly  --  she told Steve it was n't fair . p. 4 CARROL What was n't ? BUTCH My father dying before I 'm born and my mother being poor , and dying a year later . She says I may have to go to an institution . What the heck 's an institution ? CARROL That 's an orphanage , I guess . Now , listen , Butch , do n't you go worrying about anything . Everything 's wonderful out there . BUTCH How 's it really going to be ? CARROL Well , the minute you 're out there you 're alive , the same as here , only different . Out there you begin right away . BUTCH Begin what ? CARROL Living  --  and dying . They 're both beautiful , Butch . ( Happily ) Living and dying in the world . That great big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you begin being somebody : yourself . BUTCH I 'm myself right now . CARROL That 's because you 're here waiting . You 've started at last . It takes a long time to get started . It took me  --  well , I do n't know how long exactly in the world 's time  --  but it was a long time . BUTCH Steve says the world stinks . p. 5 CARROL Now , Steve is a young fellow with ideas . He 's a nice boy , but he 's wrong about the world . It 's the only place for us , and any of us who get to go out there are mighty lucky . BUTCH What happens when we leave the world ? CARROL We come back . BUTCH Here ? And wait some more ? CARROL Not here , exactly . We wait here , after we 've started . When we leave the world we go back to where we were before we came here . BUTCH Where the heck 's that ? CARROL It 's not exactly any place , Butch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where we wait . BUTCH Oh , well , I guess it 'll be all right . But nine years . What the heck chance will I have to see anything ? CARROL Butch , one day out there is a long time , let alone nine years . Twenty-four hours every day . Sixty minutes every hour . BUTCH What are you going to be out there , Mr. Carroll ? CARROL ( Laughing ) Oh , a lot of things , one after another . BUTCH Well , what ? p. 6 CARROL Well , let 's see . ( He brings out a paper and studies it ) It says here , Thomas Carroll . Mother : Amy Wallace Carroll . Father : Jonathan Carroll . Will be , at birth : Son , brother , nephew , cousin , grandson , and so on . BUTCH Brother ? CARROL Yes . I guess I 've got a sister or a brother out there , maybe a couple of sisters and a couple of brothers . BUTCH I thought we were all brothers . I thought everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but this kind of brotherhood is closer . Whoever my brother is , he has my father and mother for his father and mother . BUTCH Well , what the heck 's the difference ? I thought we were all the same . CARROL Oh , we are , really , but in the world there are families . They 're still all really one family , but in the world the family is broken down to the people you come from , and the people that come from you . It gets pretty complicated . BUTCH But everybody is one family just the same , though , ai n't they ? CARROL Well , yes , but in the world everybody forgets that for a while . p. 7 BUTCH ( Bringing out his paper , which is a good deal smaller than CARROLL 'S ) What the heck . I never looked at this . What do I get to be ? ( Reading the card ) James Nelson , also called Butch . By gosh , there it is right there . Also called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's see what I get to be . ( Reading ) Son . Newsboy . Schoolboy . ( Reflectively ) Son . No brothers ? CARROL Well , I guess not , Butch . BUTCH Why the heck not ? CARROL There will be all sorts of kids out there in Texas . They 'll all be your brothers . BUTCH Honest ? CARROL Sure . BUTCH ( Reading ) Newsboy . What 's that ? CARROL Well , I guess you 'll sell papers BUTCH Is that good ? CARROL Now do n't you worry about anything , Butch . BUTCH O.K. The heck with it . ( He puts the paper away ) p. 8 CARROL ( Affectionately ) Give me a catch , Butch . BUTCH ( Delighted ) No fooling ? CARROL Why , sure , I 'm going to play second base for the New Haven Orioles . BUTCH ( Throwing the ball , which CARROLL tries to catch ) Who the heck are they ? CARROL A bunch of kids in my neighborhood . ( He throws the ball back ) ( STEVE comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drunkard . BUTCH holds the ball and watches STEVE . Then goes to him ) BUTCH Steve ? Tell him about the war  --  and all that stuff . STEVE ( Scarcely noticing BUTCH , absorbed in thought ) Tell who , what ? BUTCH Mr. Carroll . About the war . STEVE ( Looking at CARROLL , smiling ) I was talking to the old lady  --  BUTCH He means Miss Quickly . STEVE Yeah . p. 9 BUTCH ( To CARROLL ) If everybody is everybody else 's brother , what the heck do they have a war for ? CARROL Well , now , Butch  --  STEVE ( Laughing solemnly ) I 'm afraid you wo n't be able to find a good answer for that question , Doc . BUTCH ( Delighted ) Honest , Steve ? CARROL Now , Steve , you know the world is a wonderful place . STEVE ( Simply ) I 'm sorry , but I think it stinks . I think the human race is unholy and disgusting . I think putting people in the world is a dirty trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , Steve . STEVE What is it , then ? You 're called out , everybody 's a stranger , you suffer every kind of pain there is , and then you crawl back . A little tiny place that got side-tracked in space and began to fill up with terrible unclean animals in clothes . CARROL Those animals have created several magnificent civilizations , and right now they 're creating another one . It 's a privilege to participate . BUTCH ( Delighted ) You mean the World Series ? p. 10 STEVE ( Wearily ) O.K. , Doc . Anything you say . CARROL Excuse me , Steve . Can I ask you a question ? STEVE Anything at all . CARROL What 's ahead for you ? STEVE A number of things . CARROL Wo n't you tell me what they are ? STEVE ( To BUTCH ) How about it , kid ? Come back in a few minutes . BUTCH Ah , shucks . I want to listen . I 'm not born yet . STEVE This is nothing . I 'll be seeing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , Steve . CARROL What is your destiny , Steve ? STEVE ( Pause ) Murder . CARROL ( Amazed ) Murder ? STEVE ( Slowly ) Yes . I am going to murder another human being . CARROL Oh , I 'm sorry , Steve . p. 11 STEVE He 's here , too . CARROL Here ? Who is he ? STEVE I do n't know if you 've noticed him . I have . His name is Hastings . CARROL ( Shocked ) Ralph Hastings ? STEVE That 's right . CARROL Why , he 's a nice young fellow . Are you sure it 's not a mistake ? STEVE No , it 's not a mistake . CARROL Well , good Lord . This is awful . But why ? Why do you do it ? STEVE It 's a lot of nonsense . CARROL What do you mean , Steve ? STEVE You know he 's rich . Well , he does a number of things that I think wreck the lives of poor people , so I  --  If he 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? If all I 'm supposed to do is kill him , what am I born for ? CARROL I 'm sorry , Steve . Of course you 'll never know once you 're out there . STEVE That 'll help some , of course , but I just do n't like the idea . What do you do , Doc ? CARROL Oh , nothing really . p. 12 STEVE Do you kill anybody ? CARROL No , I do n't , Steve . I do a lot of ordinary things . STEVE Do you raise a family ? CARROL ( Delighted , but shyly ) Oh , yes . Three sons . Three daughters . All kinds of grand-children . STEVE ( Sincerely ) That 's swell . That 'll help a little . CARROL Help ? Help what ? STEVE Help balance things . CARROL Do you marry , Steve ? STEVE Not exactly . CARROL ( A little shocked but sympathetic ) Oh ? STEVE I get a lot of women , but not a lot of them . I get a year of one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . ( Smiling ) I 'm a little ashamed of myself . CARROL Why should you be ashamed ? STEVE Well , she 's Peggy . CARROL ( Shocked ) Peggy ? STEVE She 'll probably be all right for me by that time . p. 13 CARROL Peggy 's really a good girl , I suppose , but she seems so  --  STEVE I do n't know her very well . ( MISS QUICKLY enters , with SEVEN KIDS , ranging in age from three to thirteen : ROOSEVELT , colored , aged 3 . ALICE , aged 5 . LARRY , aged 7 . PEDRO GONZALEZ , Mexican , aged 8 . JOHNNY GALLANTI , Italian , aged 9 . BUTCH . HENRIETTA , aged 13 ) MISS QUICKLY Now , children , what 'll it be ? Singing or play-acting ? SOME Singing . SOME Play-acting . ROOSEVELT ( Emphatically , as if with a grudge ) Nothing . MISS QUICKLY Nothing , Roosevelt ? Now , really , you want to sing , do n't you ? ROOSEVELT No . MISS QUICKLY You want to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MISS QUICKLY You want to  --  ROOSEVELT No . I do n't want to do nothing . MISS QUICKLY But why , Roosevelt ? ROOSEVELT Because . p. 14 MISS QUICKLY Because , what ? ROOSEVELT Because I do n't . MISS QUICKLY Do n't you want to have fun ? ROOSEVELT No . MISS QUICKLY ( Patiently ) But why , child ? ROOSEVELT Because . MISS QUICKLY Oh , dear . STEVE ( Calling ) Come here , Roosevelt . ROOSEVELT ( Going to STEVE ) She 's always making us do stuff . MISS QUICKLY ( Gaily , to STEVE ) Oh , thank you , Steve.All right , children , we 'll sing . ROOSEVELT ( Getting up into STEVE 'S arms ) They 're going to sing ! She 's always making people sing , or something . ( Looking at MISS QUICKLY ) Shame on you ! STEVE You stick with me , pardner . ROOSEVELT Wants ' em to play-act . MISS QUICKLY ( Sharply ) All right , children ! ( She blows the pitch ) Beautiful Dreamer by Stephen Foster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MISS QUICKLY and the CHILDREN sing the song ) That was fine , children . Now , Roosevelt , do n't you want to sing ? p. 15 ROOSEVELT ( Opening his eyes ) Shame on you  --  talk to me that way ! MISS QUICKLY My gracious ! Come along , children ! ( They go to one side ) ( RALPH HASTINGS comes in , looks around . He is a well-dressed , decent sort of fellow , same age as STEVE , but younger looking . He looks at the colored boy , runs his hand through the kid 's hair ) HASTINGS How 's the boy ? ROOSEVELT No . HASTINGS ( Laughing ) No , what ? ROOSEVELT No , everything . STEVE ( Comforting him ) O.K. , kid . ROOSEVELT ( With anger ) Only Steve 's my pardner . HASTINGS Sure . ROOSEVELT Steve 's the best man everywhere . HASTINGS ( Smiling at STEVE ) Sure , he is . CARROL ( Studying the two young men sadly ) Well , Mr. Hastings , here we are . p. 16 HASTINGS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first mortal breath . Are you pleased , Mr. Carroll ? CARROL I ca n't wait to begin . HASTINGS You , Steve ? STEVE ( Simply ) I 'm here . HASTINGS And so am I. ( Pause ) Well  --  STEVE Look . I do n't know if you know , but if you do  --  HASTINGS As a matter of fact , I do know , but what the hell  --  ! STEVE I want you to know  --  HASTINGS ( Cheerfully ) It 's all right . CARROL ( Thoughtfully ) There must be some mistake . HASTINGS No , there 's no mistake . Everything 's in order . I 'm sorry , Steve . I 'll have it coming to me , I suppose . STEVE I do n't think so . HASTINGS These things all balance . I must have it coming to me . STEVE That 's why I say the world stinks . p. 17 HASTINGS It depends , I guess . STEVE ( Sincerely ) Thanks . ( To CARROLL ) Right now he 's the way he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am that day . It 's obvious it 's not him , and not me , so it must be the world . HASTINGS We 're not human yet . STEVE You mean we 're not inhuman yet . CARROL Now , boys . HASTINGS ( Cheerfully ) Of course , Mr. Carroll . ( To STEVE ) I have a lot of fun , after a fashion , as long as it lasts . How about you ? STEVE ( Laughs , stops ) It 's O.K. ( PEGGY comes in , looks around , comes over to the three men . She simply stands near them ) You know  --  I like you , Peggy . Even here , you 're lost . PEGGY Oh , it 's boring  --  that 's what burns me up . Nothing to do . No excitement . I want to get started , so I can get it over with . I want to dance  --  I just heard a new one  --  ( Singing ) " I do n't want to set the world on fire . " ( CARROLL and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peggy  --  sure you do . PEGGY All I want to do is get it over with . I 'm in a hurry . When do we start ? STEVE ( He puts ROOSEVELT with the other kids ) Any time , now  --  any minute . They just got rid of another mob . We 're next . ( Pause , while he smiles at her ) Near you , Peggy , I 'm in a hurry myself . ( He takes her by the shoulders ) PEGGY ( Shocked a little ) Here ? STEVE What 's the difference ? I 've waited a long time for you . ( He takes her and kisses her ) You see , Peggy , you 're no good , and I love you for it . Because I 'm no good , too . I do n't know why , but it 's so . Now , before we know it , we 'll be separated and I wo n't be seeing you again for a long time . Remember me , so that when we do meet again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a poor memory , but I guess I 'll know you just the same . STEVE ( Kissing her again ) You 'll remember , do n't worry . ( They stand , kissing ) THE VOICE O.K. , people ! Here we go again ! I 'm not going to go through the whole speech . You 're going out whether you like it or not , so get going , and good luck to you ! ( Everybody goes . Only STEVE and PEGGY stand together , kissing ) O.K. , you two  --  get going ! ( PEGGY tries to move , but STEVE wo n't let her go ) Come on , come on , you American lovers , get going ! ( PEGGY struggles . STEVE holds her . She falls . He holds her terribly ) p. 19 PEGGY ( Whispering ) Let me go  --  please let me go ! ( They struggle passionately for some time ) THE VOICE What 's this ? What goes on around here ? ( A whistle is blown , like a police whistle , but STEVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , gets to her feet , turns and runs . STEVE gets up and looks around , smiling wisely . He straightens out . As he stands , a new-born babe begins to bawl , as if it were himself being born . He looks around , turns easily , and walks out )
