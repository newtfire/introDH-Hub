For days , Fidel Castro had been promising Cubans a big surprise on the July 26th anniversary of his unsuccessful 1953 attack on Dictator Fulgencio Batista 's regime . The great day came and went . No surprise . Said Castro , in his best who-me ? manner : " The revolution does not have to await a date ; revolution is a process . " Apparently he had decided , perhaps on Moscow 's advice , to go slower in proclaiming the next step in Communizing the country . The only real surprise of the week was the hijacked Eastern Air Lines Electra that landed unexpectedly ( the Cubans seemed as surprised as the passengers ) at Havana 's Jos Marti Airport . Just as unexpected was a cloudburst that accompanied the star visitor , Soviet Spaceman Yuri Gagarin , into Cuba . The rain soaked Gagarin , ruined his beautiful white uniform , and left the militia road guard standing unhappily at attention knee-deep in water . <P> The rest went off with Communist clockwork , as in any Red capital on any Red anniversary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reviewing stand with Castro , who towers over him . There , below , were the cheering masses , the enormous pictures of Lenin and Khrushchev . The expected display of half a dozen Soviet MIG-17 jets thundered overhead on schedule . There was even a seven-hour gymkhana in Civic Square by 70,000 massed " athletes . " <P> <P> The purely Castro touch was the bearded dictator 's speech-it lasted four hours , counting a 23-minute break . At one point , Castro turned to Visitor Gagarin . " While I talk , you can go twice around the world . " Said the weary spaceman , checking his watch : " Only one and a half times . " Answered Castro , returning happily to the microphone : " That means I 've still got half a world to go . " <P> Aside from an automatic attack on the " brutish imperialist beasts " of the U.S. Senate , Castro displayed uncharacteristic restraint . He announced that Cuba would " soon " become a one-party state ( which it is in practice ) , but added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years . He said that he had no intention of halting the flood of exiles ( " those worms and parasites " ) leaving the new socialism , but held out a carrot to what remains of Cuba 's middle class by promising small businessmen that the change would be gradual , even voluntary . " A socialist society is not reached in 24 hours . " <P> Watching the disturbing show , the governments of Venezuela and Colombia spoke out in alarm against the advance of Communism , and Guatemala urged the OAS to take action . Mexico 's President Adolfo Lpez Mateos quietly ordered left-wing ex-President Lazaro Cardenas to refuse an invitation to the celebrations in Havana , and approved a speech by right-wing ex-President Abelardo Rodriguez , who said : " We must never permit ourselves to be dominated by outside powers or seduced by Utopian doctrines . Unfortunately , this has already occurred in the hemisphere of liberty . "
