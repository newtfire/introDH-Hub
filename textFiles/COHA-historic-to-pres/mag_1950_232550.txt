The Korean war was reaching a decisive stage . For six weeks outgunned and outnumbered U.S. and South Korean troops had fought a heroic but heartbreaking delaying action against the Communists-trading space for time , in the phrase of the military experts . After the landing of reinforcements , including the 1st U.S. Marines , the U.S. was now in a position to make a solid stand around the vital supply port of Pusan . If the Communists did not manage to strike a decisive blow this week , their chances of driving the U.S. into the sea would be virtually gone . <P> The Communists surely knew it . They were massing on the southern and western fronts for two major drives : one straight at Pusan , the other to take Taegu , the communications hub of the northern half of the U.N . defense line . The Reds had already established several small bridgeheads east of the Naktong River near Taegu , and the city itself was under enemy artillery fire . <P> While the Reds massed for their all-out drive , U.S. marines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy off balance in the south . Meanwhile , there would probably be further but limited U.N . withdrawals on the north and northwest fronts , which are defended only by lightly armed South Korean troops . <P> There was little doubt that the final U.N . beachhead in Korea would be smaller than last week 's 140-mile defense perimeter . But U.S. troops have held small beachheads before . In 1944 , at Anzio , 62,000 U.S. troops crowded onto a beachhead 18 miles wide and 13 miles deep , held it until they had massed enough strength for a breakthrough . <P> This week the U.S. had reason to hope that the Battle of Korea would be another Anzio or Salerno-not another Dunkerque or Bataan.
