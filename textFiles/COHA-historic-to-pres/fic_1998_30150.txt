MR . M. All I ever wanted to do was teach . I never had to struggle like other people with the question of what to do with my life . My only dream was to sit on the edge of my desk in front of a room full of curious kids and talk about the world . took place in the spring of 1992 , when Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were still fresh in everyone 's mind , and Gennifer Flowers was the momentary star of tabloids and talk shows . All year long my junior Current Events class returned again and again to a single theme , what the media liked to call " the Character Issue " : How are private virtue and public responsibility intertwined ? Can you be an adulterer and a good President ? A sexual pervert and an effective , impartial member of the judiciary ? than my students . Like most American adolescents , the kids at Winwood High did n't pay too much attention to the Supreme Court or the race for the White House . Their concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hallway and locker room . students were fascinated by this sad and sordid story , and it became the nexus where their concerns linked up with those of the larger democracy . The case had not yet gone to trial at that point , but the kids at Winwood knew the details inside and out . A group of high school athletes -- the golden boys of Glen Ridge -- had been charged with luring a retarded girl into a basement , forcing her to commit a variety of sexual acts , and then penetrating her vagina with a broomstick and a baseball bat . None of the defendants denied the event had occurred . Their defense was that the girl had consented . we had football heroes , too ; the gap between them was immense , almost medieval . It was n't too hard to imagine how a lonely , mildly retarded girl might consider it a privilege of sorts to be molested and applauded by the jock royalty of her little world . They were the ones with the power of conferring recognition and acceptance . If they saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exits on the Parkway -- it did n't really surprise me that the overwhelming majority of my class , girls included , sided with the defendants and their right to a good time . If a girl , even a retarded girl , was dumb enough to join a troop of red-blooded boys in a basement , then who could blame the boys for taking advantage of this windfall ? them convicted and sent to prison , where they could find out for themselves what it meant to be scared and weak and lonely -- but I kept it to myself in the classroom , opting instead for the more neutral roles of moderator and devil 's advocate . " So do n't the strong have a responsibility not to hurt or humiliate the weak ? " exactly the kind of kid I was trying to reach , a smart , unhappy girl who wanted nothing more than to be accepted by the jock/cheerleader aristocracy at Winwood and had no idea -- how could she ? of how relieved she was going to be to find a different world in college , more charitable standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not how it works . The strong take what they want . " tell me ? " I pointed at Dino Mikulski , the steroid monster in our midst , a 285-pound brick of zits and muscle who already had major college football coaches drooling over their playbooks . " If you 're correct in your analysis , then I move that Dino be declared President of the United States . I have no doubt that he could take George Bush in a fair fight and therefore deserves to be our leader . " Dino and his lackeys exchanged high fives , celebrating his sudden ascension to the leadership of the Free World . I was pleased to see Paul Warren 's hand shoot up . silencing the room with the force of his judgment . " That girl did n't deserve what they did to her . " There , that 's where it all started , I guess I 'd choose that moment . PAUL WARREN It was like I 'd just opened my eyes after a sixteen-year nap and was wide awake for the first time in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd check out the news , and where it just used to be a blur of names and faces , now it was like , " Holy shit , people are killing each other . Little kids are starving to death . " teacher , slouching in front of the blackboard , droning on about nothing for the whole period , the boredom thickening until it came to seem like a climate , the weather we lived in until the bell rang . He had a way of explaining complicated things so they made sense to you , connecting current events with familiar details from our own lives , asking questions that really made you think . know I have . It 's no big deal . People figure you 're sick , or maybe you drank too much . But when George Bush loses his lunch in Japan , it 's a national crisis . Now why do you think that is ? What makes his vomit so different from yours or mine ? " between my parents that snapped me out of my daze . There 's nothing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you play back the tape of your existence and see it all in a whole new light . Mom was n't crying over those stupid TV movies . Our life was a soap opera , not a sitcom . And that whole time , with the clock ticking and our house waiting to explode , I was living in a dream world , grunting in the basement with Van Halen blasting , trying to bench two-fifteen , or hiding in my room with the Victoria 's Secret catalogue , studying those pictures the way I should have been studying math . ( Can somebody tell me why those women do n't have nipples ? It kind of drives me crazy . ) My sister thinks I 'm a moron for not catching on sooner . She and Mom are pretty tight ; they knew about Dad and Sarah Stiller months before the news trickled down to me . After football season , I took the PSATs along with everybody else in my class who wanted to go to college , and thought I did okay . But then the envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score in all of Winwood High . At first I thought it must be some kind of computer error . I was just a B student , coasting through school with a minimum of pain and effort . For as long as I could remember , people had been saying that Tammy was the smart one in the family . they changed everything for me . I started thinking that maybe I could get into a decent college ; maybe I could even make it through law school . Maybe I do n't have to be a card-carrying corporate drone like Dad after all , another ant in the ant farm . did , especially not on my behalf . But I 'm also eternally grateful to him for recognizing the change in me and encouraging me to act on it . The day he asked me to run for President was one of the proudest in my life . MR . M. Paul was the perfect candidate -- varsity fullback , National Merit semifinalist , a good-looking , genuinely nice kid without an ounce of arrogance or calculation . He was smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear his IQ on his sleeve . In fact , if you did n't know him well , you could have easily drawn the conclusion that he was n't the swiftest guy in the world , with that pumped-up body of his and those utterly vacant blue eyes . that . As faculty advisor to the Student Government Association , no one knew better than me that the post of President was entirely ceremonial . All you presided over were a handful of meetings and a couple of bake sales . admissions people at the selective schools are going to notice the gap between your grades and your board scores . The only thing that 's going to convince them to take a chance on you is the right mix of extracurriculars . Varsity sports look great on your application , but nothing beats President of your school . They really eat that up . " him -- and lapsed into his mild stammer. popular than she is . " TRACY FLICK All right , so I slept with my English teacher and ruined his marriage . Crucify me .

It pretty much cured me of the older-man fantasy , let me tell you that. ) unopposed . People understood that I deserved to win . They did n't necessarily like me , but they respected my qualifications : President of the Junior Class , Treasurer of the SGA , Assistant Editor of The Watchdog , statistician for the basketball team , and star of last year 's musical ( Oklahoma ! , in case you 're wondering ) . And I did all of it while conducting a fairly torrid affair with a married man , even if he did turn out to be as big a baby as any sixteen-year-old . what I hope will be a brilliant career at Georgetown University , I 'm going to get dressed up in high heels and a short skirt and head down to that Chevy dealership on the Boulevard . I 'm going to ask for Mr. M. by name and make him show me all the shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the antilock brakes . " PAUL WARREN You only need a hundred signatures to put yourself on the ballot . I 'd accumulated eighty-something my first half hour in the cafeteria when Tracy came charging up to my table in those amazing black jeans . something about her gets me all flustered . It 's pretty simple , really : she 's got this ass . Just ask any guy at Winwood . Conversations stop every time she walks down the hall . She wore these cut-offs last spring that people still talk about . expect me to believe that you just woke up this morning and decided to run for President ? " I felt like I 'd turned into a pane of glass . my hand and signing the petition . said , dotting the i in her last name with her trademark star , " and if you think you can just jump in at the last minute and take it away from me , you 're sorely mistaken . " scared , but the message I got was exactly the opposite . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fingers , " I guess we 'll just have to let the voters decide . " MR . M. The election follows an orderly , three-phase schedule . March is petition month . Any student can become a candidate simply by submitting a petition with the required number of signatures . The Candidate Assembly on the first Tuesday in April marks the official beginning of the race . The next two weeks are devoted to the campaign . The hallways and bulletin boards are plastered with signs and posters . Candidates greet their fellow students at the main door , passing out leaflets , shaking hands . The Watchdog publishes a special election issue . It 's democracy in miniature , a great educational tool . involved in Paul 's candidacy . I do n't think I admitted to myself how badly I wanted to see Tracy lose . nakedest ambition I 'd ever come in contact with . She smoldered with it , and I 'd be a liar if I said I did n't find her fascinating and a little bit dangerous , especially after what I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamroller , and I guess I wanted to slow her down before she flattened the whole school . simple : Paul Warren would make a terrific President . The office would be good for him , and he would be good for the school . And besides , he had as much right to run as Tracy did . Winwood High School was a democracy . The winner would be determined by popular vote , not my personal preference . we would have a clear-cut , two-way race between Paul and Tracy , a race I had no doubt my candidate could win . So you can imagine my annoyance on March 29th when I walked into the cafeteria and saw Paul 's little sister , a scrawny , morose-looking girl , standing behind a petition table , holding up a homemade sign .
