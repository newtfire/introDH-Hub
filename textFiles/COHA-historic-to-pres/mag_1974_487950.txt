Mutterings of an ultimate Watergate cover-up are now being heard and in the background a debate is shaping up on the broader question of where title to the public papers of public servants properly resides . President Ford may indeed be the victim of his own good intentions  --  as some of his supporters maintain  --  but even his best friends concede that the Nixon pardon and the Presidential papers agreement were not actions taken in the interest of disclosing the full story . The immediate problem , of course , is the preservation of evidenCe for the Watergate ' cover-up trial and for other pending legal actions rooted in the crimes of the Nixon administration . For the time being , at least , it seems likely that Nixon 's Finlay Lewis is a Washington correspondent of the Minneapolis Tribune . papers and tape recordings will be held in Washington , where Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski  --  and presumably others with a legal stake in the matter  --  will be free to cull any materials of evidentiary value . Ford himself appeared eager at his September 15th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safeguarded . He told reporters at that time : " The tapes and documents are still in our possession and we are , as I said a moment ago , working with the Special Prosecutor 's office , to alleviate any concerns they have as to their disposition and availability . " The " concerns " alluded to by the President were not entirely baseless . Briefing reporters on the papers agreement , Philip Buchen , Ford 's top legal adviser , had said on September 8 that the tapes would be moved to a gove ? iment facility in California , close to the San Clemente compound , " as soon as we can get rid of , or modification of , the existing orders that require that they be here . " , Despite Ford 's assurances , the Senate has passed a bill that ' would-retain fedeial custody of Nixon 's records and the House is likely to follow suit . But , even so , there is no guarantee at this point that Ford- would sign such a bill . And until ' he does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mpst astounding feature of the agreement is the Oliovision governing the custody and destruction of the tapes . Very , simply , Ford and Arthur Sampson , the Gen-eral Services ' Administrator , have tamely acquiesced in a plan that would turn the nation 's Watergate agony into a cruel mockery . Nixon , during the life of the agreement . would have almost total control over the tapes up to the moment ; when they are destroyed . In this way , Nixon would be able to write.L-or erase  --  the final chapter in the national quest for the truth about Watergate and other scandals of his administration . For this and other reasons , the deal negotiated by Nixon for his records has ' rekindled a debate that , until recently , has been of only arcane interest to archivists and a handful of historians . The key issue centers on the question of public versus private ownership of Presidential records . The Administration , basing its stand on an , opinion by Atty . Gen. William Saxbe , has come down on the side , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled , and there is reason to believe that the proponents of the public 's interest in the records of the Presidency will ultimately prevail , either in Congress or in , the courts . What is striking about the ' Saxbe opinion is the extent to which it relies on custom and tradition , rather than tqgal precedents , statutory law and the Constitution . ine major thrust of the opinion is expressed by this sentence : " To conclude , that such materials are not the property of President Nixon would be to reverse what has apparently been the almost unvaried understanding of al three branches of government since the beginning of the Republic , and to call into question practices of our Presidents since ' earliest times . " The opinion 's reliance on the vague and ambiguous phrase " almost , unvaried understanding " is not surprising . The fact is that no law of any , sort has ever conferred on Presidents , or any federal officeholders , the right to cart off , sell , destroy , conceal , or publicize the records of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost equally meager . The Saxbe opinion cites two Supreme Court rulings ; one , dealing with the remote/ subject of oil leases ' on public lands , is cited to establish the proposition that unchallenged repetition of unauthorized acts creates a presumption of legitimacy . The other ruling employed by the Attorney General ? was written by Justice Story in ' 1841 in a case involving the exercise of a copy- " the over the papers ' of George Washington . Saxbe found " ' the Story ruling supportive of the private ownership principle because ' of its conclusion that Washington 's correspondence could be subject to copyright as personal property . On the other hand , Saxbe quotes  --  but does not comment on  --  language that seems to assert a counterbalancing public.inierest in certain kinds of letters . Discussing the restrictions that the government might place on the documents , Story wrote : " On the other hand , from the nature of the public service , or the character of the documents , embracing historical , ' military or diplomatic information , it may be the right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them publicity , even against the will of the writers . " ( Italics added . ) One wonders what the Justice might have said ' if ' the letters find contained evi- ' dence of one or more criminal conspiracies . Saxbe also cites the Federal Records Act of 1950 and the 1955 Presidential Libraries Act as constituting " clear legislative acknowledgment that a President has title to all the documents and historical materials  --  whether per , sonal or official  --  which accumulate in the White House during his incumbency . " The Libraries Act , Saxbe notes , was supported by the archivist of the United States , who told a House subcommittee in 1955 that all Presidents since the Republic 's beginning regarded the documents ) generated by their incumbency as their personal property . There is nothing in the opinion , however , to suggest that Saxbe or his underlings made any independent effort to determine whether the historical record supports such bald assertions . But others have done ' so . M. B. Schnapper , a Washington editor and historian , has devoted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right to own and control the books , documents , papers , sound recordings and other records generated by government officials in pursuit of their duties . Schnapper 's guiding principle  --  and one invoked by almost everyone on his side of the debate  --  is disarmingly simple and to the point . Records , Schnapper says , that are prepared at public ex-pense , on public time and in pursuit of public business 1 1 I I ! n 1-/ ? ... W116 LV Lll1r FUL/11 ? .. JUGll IGtrl/LUD BLG , Lai a vciy /cal JCIIJG , the memory of the nation and , as such , constitute an inalienable part of its living history . The " tradition " enshrined in the Saxbe opinion , Schnapper noted ironically in an interview with the Minneapolis Tribune , is one that has been shrouded in deception and secrecy . " This tradition , " he said , " has been sub rosa from the beginning . No one has stepped up and said forthrightly , ' I 'm going to take all these records home with me when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to see what I was up to for these last few years . ' " Beyond that , Schnapper argued that the tradition itself is far more ambiguous than Saxbe suggests and that , in addition , the Nixon arrangement violates three provisions in the Constitution . Some early Presidents took their papers home with them when they left office because the young nation had not made any provision for their safekeeping in a public facility , Schnapper said . Many of the documents in question during that period " pertained to fairly intimate and relatively unimportant matters . " In the case of twelve Presidents , White House records were deposited with the Library of Congress without " any quid pro quo deals . " The Presidents were Jackson , Van Buren , Lincoln , Grant , Garfield , ' Cleveland , Benjamin Harrison , McKinley , Theodore Roosevelt , Taft , Wilson and Coolidge . Moreover , John Adams , ' John Quincy Adams , Fillmore , Buchanan , Hayes , Hoover , FDR and Kennedy " made no effort to cash in on their papers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and libraries . Beyond this rather mixed bag of past practices lies the Constitution with its provisions governing the disposal of government property , the copyrighting of government documents and the conduct of the Presidency . Thus , the constitutional proyision prohibiting a President from receiving " emoluments " other than his salary would be violated if a President were able to sell official documents at a profit , Schnapper said . And if that 's true , Schnapper argued , there is no logical basis for assuming that an ex-President acquires property rights that were denied him while in office . Saxbe describes this objection as " ' circular , . . except insofar as it apples to the blank typing paper and materials upon which the Presidential records are inscribed . For the records themselves are given to the President as an emolument ' only if one assumes that they are not the property of the President from the very moment of their creation . " But in rebuttal to that view , it seems clear enough that the unique value attached to Presidential records is a function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If so , then the President who takes records with him acquires an asset whose value is intrinsically public . In that sense , Presidential papers , if viewed as private property , constitute an emolument unique to the office of the Presidency . Nelson Rockefeller , the nominee for Vice President , appears to have felt the force of that argument when , on leaving the governorship of New York , he had made ( at his expense ) a complete microfilm record of all of his official papers , and left the originals in the Statehouse files . Another article of the Constitution grants Congress the power " to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and- inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries . " Said Schnapper , " In view of this very clear phrasing , officially generated writings , official records of governmental affairs can hardly be considered private property . " Congress has clarified the situation further by enacting Section 8 of the Copyright Act which says , " No copyright shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . " It seems evident from the language that government documents  --  an imprecise term which may or may not include Presidential records  --  can not be regarded as private property . A third constitutional provision gives Congress the sole power to dispose of property belonging , to the United States . Schnapper said flatly that " Congress has never enacted a law sanctioning the ownership of official documents by ex-Presidents . " So sure was he of that statement that he publicly offered a $1,000 reward last December to anyone who could point to a law permitting official documents to be taken as personal property . The reward was never collected . As for the Presidential Libraries Act , Schnapper 's research has turned up two draft versions of the measure which contained language recognizing Presidential documents as the private property of the officeholder . But , significantly , the language was dropped from the final bill . Schnapper is one of several potential litigants who are strongly considering lawsuits to challenge Mr. Ford 's disposition of the Nixon papers and seek a ruling placing all such records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they would not be the first to go to court over the issue , James McCord , one of the original Watergate defendants , has filed papers challenging Sampson 's authority to negotiate the agreement . And a related issue is already being fought out in the courts as the result of an action brought by Ralph Nader 's Tax Reform Research Group which is seeking access to Nixon 's pre-Presidential papers under the Freedom of Information Act . In a brief , Nader lawyers argue , " Papers , such as those sought here , all or nearly all of which were prepared by public officials , who were being paid from public funds to do the public 's work , are public , not private , papers . . . . If Mr. Nixon , as a private citizen , had the power to restrict access , then he could also deny access by destroying these historically irreplaceable papers , even though they may be necessary to continued and efficient operation of the federal government . Neither common sense nor the Libraries Act allows such a result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement has been attacked from other quarters as well . In an interview , Raoul Berger , a constitutional law professor at Harvard , said : " The records were compiled with government money on government time , so there is a presumption that they belong to the United States . " And he added , " Repetition of an illegal act does n't legitimatize usurpation . " Writing in The Washington Post , Arthur S. Miller , a-0 law professor at George Washington University , recalled ' Sen. Sam Ervin 's frequent barbed ' reminders to Watergate w " tnesses during the hearings of , his Senate Select Committee : " We have had thievery and homoc:cle for thousands of years but that does not make murder meritorious ror larceny legal . " Miller also effectively demolishes the claim that illegal actions by the executive branch , ony.thow become legal if left unchallenged for a period of time . He says of Nixon 's claim that his fund impoundments were sanctioned by Presidential practices dating all the way back to Jefferson , " Of more than three dozen judicial opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority emphatically rejected the broad claim of Presidential power . " In another area , Miller notes , the Nixon administration 's assertion of an " inherent " power to wiretap was soundly repudiated when finally tested in the Supreme- Court . And the administration suffered a similar reversal on executive privilege  --  a doctrine that supposedly had been sanctioned by history . The Ford Administration has been quite candid in admitting it wants to shuck , Once and for all , any responsibility for mediating conflicting claims by Watergate and other litigants over the records accumulated during the Nixon years . The agreement with Nixon was , in short , intended to emancipate Ford from the sins of his predecessor . Said Buchen at the September 8th briefing : Therefore , it became apparent . . . the present Administration would be enmeshed for a long time in answering the disputed claims over who could obtain information from the Nixon records , how requested information could , as a practical matter , be extracted from the vast volume of records in which it might appear , and how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be determined , and at the same time to try satisfying the claims of Mr. Nixon that he owned the records . Those are troublesome problems , no doubt , but Ford must have known the hardships that would be created by making Nixon the keeper of the records accumulated during his tenure . Under the agreement , the recipient of a Watergate or related subpoena must notify Nixon who , " as the owner and custodian of the materials with sole right and power of access thereto , " will be empowered to " assert any privilege or power " that he thinks may be rightfully his . To savor the full irony of this provision , one need only recall Nixon 's skills in the art of stonewalling . But the agreement , of course , does n't stop there . Carrying the private property concept to its ultimate conclusion , Ford and Sampson accepted Nixon 's demand that the tapes be ultimately destroyed . For Nixon , this may be a kind of revenge . The tapes  --  or rather the evidence they contained  --  were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us , it means that the full story of Watergate may never be known . And for history , it certainly means the loss of one of the most extraordinary and illuminating records of a Presidency ever assembled . Watergate aside , the Administration 's attitude toward history seems curious . At the briefing , Buchen had this exchange with reporters : Q. Why are they going to be destroyed ? A. Well , maybe they never should have been made in the first place . This was his desire and I think it is consistent with the fact that these matters do involve conversations with people who had no realization that their voices were being recorded . As an old spokesman for the right of privacy , I think there is considerable merit for putting these in a separate category from documents . Q. Mr. Buchen , was any consideration given to the right of history ? A. I am sure the historians will protest , but I think historians can not complain if evidence for history is not perpetuated which should n't have been created in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can shape " history  --  and the news  --  by determining what materials are in the public domain and what materials are not . And they may even attempt to do so for the most laudable of motives . But life goes on and nothing can change the fact that events which occur daily involve unsuspecting agents who have no idea that their words and deeds are of significance to current and future generations . In a paper prepared for the American Society of Archivists , J. Fred Cook , archives director at the University of Wisconsin , argues : A desire to avoid embarrassing former officials by revealing frank discussiOns of political advisers can in no way be equated to the right of the public to have exposed examples of corruption or bad decisions . Acquiescence by archivists in a policy of restricted access that hides past errors in policy may lead to similar mistakes being made in the future simply through ignorance of past decisions . Thus , we are made colleagues of the undertaker who quietly buried the doctor 's mistakes . Or , in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Watergate in history 's ears .
