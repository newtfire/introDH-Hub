By merging all its electric operating subsidiaries into the proposed West Penn Electric Co. through an exchange of stocks , American Water Works &; Electric , according to H. Hobart Porter , president , will accomplish an undertaking long contemplated by the parent company 's management . In developing its electric system the American 's policy has been to acquire companies whose properties could eventually be interconnected with its principal subsidiary , the West Penn Co. , so as to form a superpower system . ' The Monongahela West Penn Public Service , Potomac Edison and the Keystone Power &; Light companies were originally acquired with that ultimate objective in mind . The main purpose of the present undertaking is to effect complete unification of these properties into one system .
