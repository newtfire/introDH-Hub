Worshipers at the cathedral of Notre Dame last Easter were shocked by a young man in the robes of a Dominican monk , who stormed the pulpit and shouted " God is dead ! " ( TIME , April 17 ) . Paris psychiatrists took him over from the police for examination and the current issue of the English-language literary journal , Transition , carries the psychiatrists ' report . Samples of the report 's psychiatric word-weaving : <P> " Michel Mourre suffers from psychical disturbance of the schizomaniacal ( Claude ) type . Pride , desire to show off his personality and to represent himself entirely in his actions . . . Auto-didactism . Blitz philosophico-culture , with motorised arguments , but no main striking force . Highly assured personal modern outlook . Indignant irritation at the suggestion that Being may have preceded existence . . . Vaingloriously established in existentialism . <P> " Present ocular reflexes indifferent . Very strong tendinous reactions . Trembling in tongue and fingers . Hyper-emotivity . Intelligent . Able to go straight to the core of a doctrine . A didactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artistic but republican mind . Possibility of a cure following a fit of modesty . His condition requires that ... he be confined in a lunatic asylum , where he can receive the treatment of which he is in need . " <P> The report was more shocking to Parisian intellectuals than the original incident had been to the worshipers . To many , it sounded like a fair description of any eager young existentialist . So shrill , in fact , was the outcry that tendinous , hyperemotive Michel Mourre was released on bail , has written ( for a couple of French newspapers ) the memoirs of his autodidactic life as a Dominican student , as an existentialist , and as a bohemian .
