Comment upon the new departure of the Chamber of Commerce on Thursday evening in singling out for honorable mention six New York citizens - is naturally embarrassing for THE TjelEa , since its own Publisher was included in the list . But that fact should not disable us from hailing the happy innovation . IAt least the other names will be recognized as truly representative of education , science , art , architecture and philanthropy . The " citations " read in the case of each of these gentlemen sounded very like those which go with the granting of a university degree . But in this instance it was like the broader university of a great city . recognizing . through one of its long-established organizations citizens whom it believed to have done the public some service . while being eminent in their own puratiits or ornaments of their own professions . The simplicity of the procedure heightened its significance . There was no academic costume , no medals , no prizes . The audience was merely : asked to approve , as it did heartily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , in this public way , of the variety of talent and the range of activity which private citizens may display to the ? general advantage . It is not known if the ceremony of Thursday is to be repeated every year .. Perhaps it would seem less staled by custom if it were made not too frequent . But the idea behind it is ? most felicitous . It indicates that the Chamber of Commerce wishes to illustrate some of its ideals by living examples . It desires occasionally to point to personalities as well , as to ? principles . And it is ready to break with what sometimes seems to be the common assumption that we must not pause to honor a man until after he is dead . We do not act on that supposition in our personal contacts and ' intercourse , and there is no reason why we should do so in an organized capacity . WILT.IAM JAMES once wrote to a correspondent that he liked recognition , and added , whimsically , " When I say recognition , I mean praise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chamber of Commerce took up the old saying , " Let us now praise famous men , " and gave it a significant modern application .
