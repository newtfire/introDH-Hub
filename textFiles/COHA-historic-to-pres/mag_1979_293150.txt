Byrd instructs the Soviets <P> He strongly denied that he had come to the Soviet Union to give the Kremlin a U.S. civics lesson , but that is exactly what West Virginia 's Robert Byrd did last week . During a five-day visit to the U.S.S.R. , the Senate majority leader repeatedly stressed to his hosts that the Senate is determined , as set forth in the U.S. Constitution , to play its own independent role in SALT II . <P> Speaking to a group of Soviet officials , Byrd cautioned that Moscow would " not contribute to a constructive discussion of the treaty " by expecting the Senate to be the White House 's rubber stamp . Byrd was presumably alluding to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko 's statement that it would be the " end of negotiations " if the Senate amended SALT II . Byrd also advised the Soviets not to be offended by the rhetoric that will be sounded during the SALT debate . Said he : " The conscientious application of our constitutional process should not be viewed as a challenge to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress that as a Senator he is not tied to the White House . Thus , even though State Department experts had accompanied him from Washington , he pointedly took none of them and no members of the U.S. Embassy with him for his 1-hr , and 45-min. meeting with Soviet Communist Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev . Administration officials were similarly excluded from Byrd 's more-than-two-hour talk with Gromyko . This session began on an amiable note , with the Foreign Minister observing that his pile of briefing notes was thinner than Byrd 's thick folder . " That 's just my notebook , " replied the majority leader . " I 'm going to write down what you tell me . " <P> What he wrote down-as well as what he specifically told the Soviet leaders - was kept secret . To reporters in Moscow , Byrd merely said : " I did not come here expecting simple answers . I asked questions , made suggestions and observations . It may take some time for it to be known what the Soviet response will be . " <P> Byrd acknowledged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Soviets . Said he : " What I have heard here will help me consider . " As one of the Senate 's most powerful members , he could play the pivotal role in determining the treaty 's fate . On leaving Moscow , Byrd said : " I will not make up my own mind immediately . I will await at least some of the hearings . " Those hearings were scheduled to begin this week when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee opens the great debate by calling two of SALT 'S strongest supporters : Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Defense Secretary Harold Brown . ?
