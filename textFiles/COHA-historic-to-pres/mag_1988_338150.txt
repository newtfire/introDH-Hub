Her freckles are utterly disarming . She enhances their effect by wearing her hair in a girlish bob . Her round brown eyes seem to be perpetually widened in astonishment at the inventiveness that people lavish on wicked enterprises . In short , Ryoko Itakura ( Nobuko Miyamoto ) does not fit anyone 's image of a tax collector . But in her case , appearances are usefully deceptive . They camouflage a spirit demonically dedicated to exposing the cheating heart of the all-too-typical taxpayer . <P> Hideki Gondo ( Tsutomu Yamazaki ) is her dark double , a crippled , spidery man whose vast real estate portfolio includes a chain of notorious hot-sheet hotels . Gondo 's outward manner vividly contrasts with Ryoko 's . He too has a childish air about him , but it is the air of a spoiled child . Abruptly cruel and totally selfish , he is as maniacally dedicated to tax avoidance as she is to tax compliance . She may spare a moment from investigative accountancy for compassion ( directed at his troubled teenage son ) . He may digress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing ( directed at her ) . But fundamentally they are both driven by passions that are beyond rational analysis or control . <P> Except by Juzo Itami , a filmmaker to whom obsession is character , the source of everything that is interesting and wacko in human behavior . In last year 's Tampopo he genially satirized the spiritual contortions people will undergo when gripped by a fervor for haute cuisine . In A Taxing Woman his subjects are relentless greed and implacable righteousness , and his mood is , appropriately , much darker . <P> As before , he is rigorously informative about the hard , occasionally grotesque labors that disproportionate passions demand of their victims . If you thought you learned more than you needed to know about the creation of the perfect noodle soup in Tampopo , you may now feel you are finding out more than you require about tax law and outlawry in contemporary Japan . But arcana have their own peculiar charms  --  and their special usefulness in Itami 's larger design . When his single-minded characters are thwarted in the pursuit of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst into sudden , angry flame . And to elicit hysterical responses from bystanders astounded when a quiet oddball turns into a bright-burning fireball . <P> In Tampopo the amount of unpredictably bad behavior occasioned by the pursuit of a great recipe was funny and surreal . In A Taxing Woman , where the subject is money , these outbursts are more shocking than risible , especially when Ryoko 's revenue-agent colleagues eventually stage a mass raid on Gondo 's home and demonstrate they are every bit as mad in their pursuit of justice as he is in defense of miserliness.
