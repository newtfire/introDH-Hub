Labor 's 1954 Battle Cry <P> IN its long fight for more security , organized labor is now poised for an assault on a new objective : the guaranteed annual wage . Though unions have talked about the G.A.W. for years , there was little real enthusiasm for it while jobs were plentiful and overtime commonplace . But now , with unemployment brushing 4,000,000 , union leaders in the mass-production industries are ready for the big push . <P> The push was started by the C.I.O. 's International Union of Electrical Workers , which asked Westinghouse Electric Corp . to guarantee its employees 52 forty-hour weeks a year-or the equivalent in pay . Under the I.U.E. plan , Westinghouse would set aside 5% of its payroll ( about 10 an hour per employee , or $12 million annually on the present union-covered payroll ) until ten weeks ' pay for each worker is accumulated . Laid-off workers would be paid out of the fund only after the plan was in effect for a year . In the event of heavy layoffs , Westinghouse would not be liable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steelworkers , next in line , will ask for a guaranteed annual wage when they open negotiations next month . The C.I.O. Autoworkers last week outlined the 52-week plan that they expect to demand when their contracts with car manufacturers run out next year . Dave Beck 's A.F.L. Teamsters ' Union , third biggest in the U.S. , has already signed 29 guaranteed wage contracts , covering 2,857 workers . <P> Wage guarantee plans are not new . There are more than 200 in operation , most of them management-sponsored . For example , Procter &; Gamble Co. guarantees employees a straight 48 weeks of work a year ; Geo . A. Hormel &; Co. guarantees 52 weeks a year by charging overtime in rush periods against undertime when business is slow ; Nunn-Bush Shoe Co. sets wages at a fixed percentage of sales , thereby has given full employment since 1935 . <P> The plans , by themselves , have not stabilized employment . The companies had to stabilize employment first by drastically changing production and selling methods . For example : Procter &; Gamble provided warehouses to store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get wholesalers to level out their buying . <P> These companies have a big advantage over mass-production , hard-goods industries . They make necessities which are easily stored and quickly consumed . Thus , they are not subject to the wild fluctuations of the hardgoods industries , where purchases of new cars and refrigerators are easily postponed in bad times , and great quantities can not be stored . <P> For a guaranteed wage plan to work in the hard-goods industries , production would have to be stabilized and buying habits changed . But how ? The steel industry , for example , can not store products because it makes most of them on order to exact specifications . The auto industry could stabilize some 19% of the steel industry ( the amount of steel it buys ) if it could find a way to get around the public 's habit of buying cars in the spring and making the old one do during slumps . To even out buying , C.I.O. President Walter Reuther once suggested a sliding price scale with lower prices in slack seasons . But there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discounts during the winter . And the industry is still subject to the ups and downs of boom and recession , which could easily exhaust G.A.W. funds .
