There 's a fresh crop of bratty divas on the scene . Now , scarred insiders spill tales of famous girls who bared their fangs . For every bitchy-star story that makes front-page news , there 's one that the tabloids never catch wind of . ( As ever-present as the paparazzi try to be , they 're barred from private residences , movie sets , and other places where celebs tend to bring out their claws . ) And so the most horrifying incidents usually remain well-kept secrets within close-knit Hollywood circles . That is precisely why Cosmo goes straight to those very insiders to get the uncensored scoop . We 've told you about some serious divas in the past , but this new batch of bratty babes make their predecessors seem downright angelic . You 'd never guess who these anecdotes are about ( it 's so often the ones who seem so sweet ! ) , but give it a try . Workout Wacko VICTIM : PERSONAL TRAINER " A former supermodel comes into our gym and acts like it 's her own personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like slaves , screaming at them in Spanglish : " Hola ! Yoo-hoo ! Necesito eucalyptus for el steam room-o ! Pronto ! ' She goes into the steam room for hours at a time , where she uses some creamy green stuff to exfoliate her whole body . She leaves dirty towels caked with leftover dead flesh and green lotion all over the place for everyone else to clean up . " Once , I was with a client who wanted to use a treadmill that this actress had covered with her belongings  --  coffee , extra sneakers , and clothes . When I politely asked her to move her things , she snapped , " Do I look like a maid to you ? Move it yourself ! ' I was furious , but there were no other treadmills , and my client was my first priority , so I went to move her crap . When she saw me , she started screaming , " Do n't touch my stuff , you bitch ! ' It took everything in me not to yell back or just slap her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't around . Andreas Gebhard/Getty Images . For illustrative purposes only . Individuals pictured have no connection to the story . " The final straw was when I went into the locker room and was confronted with this hideous and haunting view : She was sitting completely naked and spread-eagle over one of the sinks , basically straddling the faucet and talking loudly on her cell phone while she shaved her bikini line . I mean you could see everything . I still gag every time I go near that sink ! " The Devil Steals Prada VICTIM : FORMER FRIEND " I went to college with a girl who is now a well-known actress . After graduation , she started making movies , and I went to graduate school . She hit it big pretty quickly while I racked up a ton of debt . We were unlikely pals considering the fact that I could barely afford to pay my rent and she was raking in millions , but we had a lot of history and always had fun together . " A couple of years after school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She came down a few days after me , and when I picked her up at the airport , she was carrying the brand-new Prada tote that I had been coveting for months but could n't in my wildest dreams have saved up enough money to buy . I was like " You got my favorite bag ! I love it ! ' Without missing a beat , she replied , " Oh , actually , my mom bought this for you as a gift for having me , but I took it because you already had a black bag . ' " The black bag I had was a free gift that came with a makeup purchase . And it was pleather and had a big rip in the front ! The girl came from money and was making a fortune . She could have bought herself 100 Prada bags ! But she had to take the one that was a gift to me . Plus , the rich bitch spent the next week complaining about everything while still freeloading off my parents . " Trailer Trashed VICTIM : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie before . We all thought she 'd be over the moon about being cast and try really hard to make a good impression on everyone . But the exact opposite happened : It was like getting this part was validation that she was better than everyone else , including the rest of the cast . And PAs like me ? She would n't even look us in the eye ! " Since she 'd never had a lead role , she 'd never had her own trailer before , which was why what happened on the first day of shooting was so truly astounding . She marched into her trailer and then walked right out , demanding that we change the carpet if we ever expected her to go in there again ... and if we ever wanted her to learn her lines . She just did n't like the color ! It was green ! Since when is green so offensive ? " Pissy Princess VICTIM : PRODUCTION ASSISTANT " I had always heard bad things about this TV and movie starlet , but she seemed so sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her films that I saw the kind of behavior that I 'd been warned about and the side of her that she ( and her publicist ) keeps carefully concealed from her fans . " We were filming in the middle of nowhere in Texas . She had her own deluxe trailer with her very own private bathroom that was literally a two-minute walk from the set . But she decided that was too far to walk and claimed the only porta potty near the set . She would n't allow anyone else to use it . She even made her bodyguards stand in front of it all day long just to make sure no one dared relieve themselves in there . " On days when she was n't filming , she actually took the key with her so that no one could get in and her rule would be enforced in her absence . Talk about control issues . It was easy for guys because they could always go pee in a bush somewhere , but the women on set had to trek nearly 10 minutes to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom . " Hookup From Hell VICTIM : ACTOR " I was in New York doing press for a movie that I had filmed with this actress . She barely spoke to me when we were on set and never hung out with the rest of the cast and crew . We always just thought she was a bitch  --  a really hot bitch but a bitch nonetheless . Out of the blue , after one of the press events , she asked if I wanted to go get a drink with her to catch up . She was really flirty with me at the bar , and then she asked if I wanted to go back to her hotel . " It was pouring outside , but we managed to find a cab . We started making out in the taxi until she pulled away , hiked up her skirt , spread her legs , and  --  how do I put this ?  --  demanded that I perform a certain sexual act on her . The cab was disgusting and I could see the driver watching , so I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . " Do it now , " she said . And when I would n't , she yelled at the driver to stop the car . She literally pushed me out of the cab while it was still moving and told me to go fuck myself . I could n't find another cab , so I walked back to the hotel in the pouring rain . I should have trusted my instincts  --  that girl is one crazy bitch ! " VIP = Very Insecure Person VICTIM : AGENT 'S ASSISTANT " I was with my friend at a party being held at a club , and we talked our way into the VIP area . The party was being hosted by an actress who we used to be good friends with before she became famous and stopped returning our calls . She was always an insecure and jealous person , but we assumed that with all of her fame and fortune , she would have outgrown that . " When we got there , we could n't help but notice that there were very few women in the VIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and say hello to her when she started glaring at us and whispering to people . Suddenly , one of her bodyguards roughly took hold of our arms and asked , " Were you invited into this area ? ' It was so embarrassing ! " He escorted us outside the velvet-rope area while she watched and laughed with a bunch of guys . Before we left the club entirely , we watched it happen with several other girls . The actress was so obsessed with herself and yet so insecure that she apparently did n't even want any other women  --  especially any attractive ones  --  in her area . It was , as usual , all about her . " Rude Roommate VICTIM : ACTRESS AND FORMER HOUSEMATE " I lived with this woman when we were both struggling actresses who had just moved to L.A. We eventually got the same agent , and she was cast in a TV show . Without giving me any notice , she moved out of our place and into this luxurious new apartment while I rushed to find a new roommate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once in a while , and one day , she sat there gloating that she had gotten cast approval , so she could ensure that none of the other actresses on the show were prettier than she was ! She 'd always say that she would try to help me get an audition , but she never actually did . " Our agent was the one who eventually got me an audition for her show , as a day player ( essentially , a one-day part ) . When I went in , the casting director  --  who I 'd known since way back , when my friend and I were roommates  --  asked me if we were still friends . I said yes . It was the truth ; I was just being honest . " My agent called me an hour later and told me that I got the role ! It was just a line or two , but it would pay my rent for an entire month ! And then , the next thing I knew , I got another call from my agent saying that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she accused me of dropping her name in the audition . She apparently made such a big deal out of it that the casting director fired me , and she even bullied our agent into dropping me . I have never felt so betrayed in my entire life . I ca n't figure out if she just did n't want to see me succeed or if she felt threatened because she thought I was better looking than she is . Either way , it was so beyond cruel . " Acting Like a Baby VICTIM : CALLIGRAPHER " I agreed to design the baby announcements for a famous television actress . I had been speaking with her assistant , and she kept asking for more of a discount . I had already agreed to give her 25 percent off my regular price , but that was n't enough for her . What was so annoying is that she 's loaded , and I 'm just trying to make a living here . " One day , the actress called me herself , cursing and screaming that she was going to ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . I hung up on her , and we never spoke again , although I have heard that she tells anyone who will listen that she fired me for doing a " disgusting " job . That was a total lie , considering I never even did the cards at all . " Dress Diva VICTIM : FILM PUBLICIST " I was in the midst of planning the premiere for a movie , and I knew the star of the film was supposed to be notoriously difficult to work with . The night before the event , she e-mailed me to tell me that she was going to be wearing red , and if anyone else there was wearing that color , she would not show up . I did n't know what to do ! How do you ensure that no one else at a party will wear the color red ? " I talked to her manager , agent , and publicist , and they were finally able to get her to agree to come as long as no one else in the cast was wearing red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wearing to all the other premieres , so that I could make sure none of the other cast members were wearing those shades on those particular evenings . I spent two days begging people to switch their outfits . No one wanted to do it , and I had to help them find new things to wear . In the end , they all hated me for even asking them to do it . She made my life hell . " ? The Sweetest Celebs They 're a rarity in showbiz , but a few do exist . These chicks have reputations for being the nicest around . ANNE HATHAWAY She 's no devil .

MANDY MOORE She has been called " inherently sweet . " CAMERON DIAZ That 100-watt smile matches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pro at playing a bitch on TV , but in reality , she 's quite gracious . JENNIFER ANISTON After all that she 's been through , she 's still completely charming . DREW BARRYMORE Growing up in the industry did n't affect her attitude . She really is as sweet as she looks . Naughty-Girl Nicknames * Fed-up production associates confess the covert monikers they 've created for three movie-set monsters . * " I worked with one actress who would randomly get into a rage and scream and start throwing things and slamming doors . She literally looked crazy and possessed , so we started referring to her as Lucifer behind her back . " * " I named this girl Jurassic Park because she was so moody and awful . Like the dinosaurs in the movie , she looked really cute and sweet but would suddenly , without warning , turn into a horrible fire-breathing monster . " * " I had to deal with this total attention whore . She was really theatrical , like " Look at me ! I 'm a huge star ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting circles is used to describe theater geeks who take themselves too seriously . " <p>
