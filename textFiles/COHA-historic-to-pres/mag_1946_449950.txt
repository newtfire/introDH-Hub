the morning of January 30 , 1944 , at ap- proximately 0800 , we left Chabua in a C-46 bound for Kunming , China , on what I anticipated would be a regular mission . It was raining very hard when we left Chabua , and from all reports the Hump was n't going to be much better . ' 1 his was my second consecutive trip in ship 413 and my twenty-first trip over the Hump . I had a swell crew ? the engineer lived with me and I had flown before with the pilot , Lieutenant Anderson . About an hour and fifteen minutes out I received the report " Red-wing , " which meant " enemy aircraft in the vicinity . " I told Anderson , but he was n't concerned because it was very cloudy and he figured he could dive into a valley and get away if the enemy showed himself . Everything was going well , and I thought this would be just another trip , when all of a sudden things started to pop . I had been dozing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it was hard for me to believe , Zeros had actually shot out the left engine . Lieutenant Anderson immediately feathered the prop . The co-pilot dived from his seat for his chute and motioned for me to get into mine . The ship was shaking terrifically , and without any questions , I unfastened my oxygen hose and ran to the rear for my chute . Without oxygen at 18,500 feet , this much exertion really knocks you out , so by the time I had my chute on , I was puffing like an old steam engine and seeing spots . I could n't buckle my right leg strap , which was too short , and I was very nervous . In the meantime , the ship had gone into a 45-degree dive and the engineer had opened the emergency door . I saw flames up front and knew it Would n't be long before we took the " big step . " The pilot waved back , and the engineer took one look and jumped . I watched his face as he hit the A native of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School in 1942 , JOHN BAanzrr BAL1.011 served for three years in the Army Air Forces , chiefly in the CBI theater . He emerged as a Sergeant with the Air Medal , the DFC and clusters . One might say that he had good luck in his flying , for he survived a crash landing in Nigeria , and in his fifty-six trips over the Bump he twice bailed out into the Kachin country . Here is how it feels to jump for your life . 86 slip stream , and I have never seen a man 's face change expression so fast . He was gone in an in. stant , but seeing him take that step made me re . alize just what I was getting ready to do . The co-pilot followed the engineer . Then I stepped to the door with my hand on my rip cord . The rip cord came out of its elastic pocket before I left the ship , and when I jumped , the slip stream jerked my arm , opening my chute much too soon . My back grazed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a brick wall . When I came to , probably half a minute later , I was seeing spots and my left leg was killing me . The chest strap had come up and was cutting my neck . The force jerked me out of the seat of the chute , and despite all my efforts , I could n't get back . I just hung there by my neck and one kg . It seemed as if I were standing still , for I could n't see the ground on account of the undercast . I heard a loud roar , and looking over my left shoulder I saw the ship , empty and on fire , making a sharp bank on its side and coming directly at me . It whizzed past me with its wings perpendicular to the ground , so close that I could see the controls in the cockpit . After the ship had passed me , the " prop wash " caught my chute and collapsed it . I had a free fall of about five hundred feet and then it caught again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship 's making another pass at me . Then I heard a huge explosion and knew that it had finally hit . My neck was bleeding ; I could n't get into my seat ; since I had n't buckled my right leg strap , the left strap was bearing all the weight and cutting deeply into my leg ; and it was raining hard . As soon as I broke out of the overcast and could see the ground , I realized that I was descending rapidly . I looked over the area and saw a stream to my left and decided to head for that as soon as I hit , but I had n't yet noticed how thick the jungle was . I was still surveying the situation when , before I knew it , I was crashing through the treetops and finally came to a stop about ten feet from the ground . I undid my straps and dropped to the ground exhausted and nauseated from nervous . neg . I must have sat there for an hour resting and praying , giving thanks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not losing my gun belt when the chute opened , and I still had my pistol with the primary twenty-one rounds intact . The jungle was so thick that I could n't turn around without hacking with my machete for a few minutes . Within a half hour I encountered a cobra . I shot at it , but succeeded in killing it only after firing a full clip . I never was very good with a gun , so from then on I traveled with my machete in my right hand and the .45 in my left . I had to laugh at the sight I must have made . Could this be me , the peaceful kid from Salem , Massachusetts , lost in the middle of Burma ? I could n't believe it . I was sitting on a log munching on a piece of chocolate when I heard voices in the distance . For the first time it dawned on me that I might be behind Jap lines . I no sooner got to my feet when a dog saw me and ran at me , barking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader , saw me next . I could hear him cock his rifle as he dropped to the ground . The other natives followed suit , and all guns were aimed at me . I walked toward them with my hands up , and they stood up . I learned later that they thought we were dap paratroopers invading Burma . The leader then mumbled something to me , so I opened my jacket and showed him the flags sewn inside ? first the American , then the Burmese . But I might just as well have shown him a picture of my Aunt Nellie for all the recognition I got out of him . Then I took out the small piece of paper which I had been carrying and which had Kachin and Burmese phonetics on it and started in with my first struggle with Burmese pronunciation . 2 IT seemed to me that we were walking at a terrific pace , but these short-legged little fellows appeared to be traveling with ease . I knew then that my soft Air Corps career had caught up with me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wished I had been trained for the Infantry . The climbing did n't seem to faze them at all , while I was exhausted from the beginning . They had legs like " Charlie Atlas " ? all muscle . I was so tired from climbing that it seemed to me as if we had covered half of Burma when we finally arrived at our goal . I noticed a small gathering of natives in front of a long , narrow building , or Walla , made of bamboo and grass . Their eyes seemed to pierce right through ine , and I felt nervous not knowing just how this group would receive me . After the preliminary greetings and explanations between the natives were over , the leader of my original group turned to me and went through the motions of washing himself . I knew what he meant , for I was a sight , so I nodded in the affirmative . One little fellow came over and led me down to a small stream . As I shed my clothing , he took it and started washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were quite a few leeches stuck to my legs . They are hard to remove , and I was having quite a bit of trouble until my little laundryman noticed my plight . He immediately dropped his work and set out to show me the correct way to remove a leech . He ran back to the basha and emerged with a flaming piece of bamboo . He would touch the leeches with little pieces of red-hot bamboo and their heads would immediately come out of my leg , and then he would brush them off . The villages were made up of one or two long buildings in which the people lived , plus a few little buildings for chickens , pigs , and water buffaloes ? their work horses . The main buildings contained about a dozen fireplaces with a separate family gathering at each one . After the " supper dishes were done , " the men got out their little bamboo cups and started mixing up their evening smoke of opium . They do n't smoke it straight like the Chinese , but mix it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little metal pans and then dip this grass in by means of chopsticks . Then they go through a process of rolling and pressing until the mixture becomes quite firm . Next they mix up some sort of liquid which I supposed was for a mouthwash . Their final step is to bring out their pillows , which are solid wooden blocks . They have a hard time keeping their pipes lighted , but that does n't worry them because they 're sound asleep before they get many drags . They take a few puffs sitting up , followed by a little mouthwash . Then they lie down with their heads and pipes on the wooden blocks , contentedly puffing away until they pass out . After the sun had gone down , it started to get very cold , but I had n't noticed it , sitting so close to the fire . When I decided to try to get some sleep , I pulled a few banana leaves over me for a covering . They were n't warm at all , but were a little better than nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and regardless of the shape of my bed , I slept like a log . I was awakened about five o'clock the next morning by the roosters ' crowing . I saw a young na tive fixing a chicken for breakfast . He put it on a rock , chopped off the head and feet , discarded them , then proceeded to chop up the rest into small pieces ? feathers , intestines , and all ? and finished by dumping everything into a pan and putting it on the fire to cook . It turned out pretty well , though , if you could pick up a piece of meat out of the assortment . They gave me two hard-boiled eggs with salt . They treasured salt as we do sugar today . They hid it away in a slender bamboo casing , and when they offered me some they did so with the elegance of a king knighting me . It was crude rock salt and rather a purplish color , but it was salt , so I used it rather than hurt their feelings . After eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball , but soon gave it up , since pitching the ball and trying to hit it , run out and catch it , and throw myself out at first base was just a little too much for me . They got a big kick out of my attempt , at any rate , and I figured that as long as I stayed in their good graces I was safe . In the meantime older natives had been hustling around , apparently getting things together for a trip . A few of them went down the hill and came back with three elephants . I was as pleased as a child with a new toy , since I naturally thought we were going to ride on them . By this time my stiffness was working out , but I still felt as if I were a hundred years old . As we were standing around watching them put the bamboo harness on the elephants , we heard a long " Ka-cha-ee " which came from the valley . One of the natives answered and ran down to meet whoever was approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was my tent mate , the engineer , Burkhardt , being helped along by two natives . I ran out to give him a hand . He had a broken rib and bruises all over his body . He had landed in a tree about fifty feet from the ground and had undone his chest straps first . When he bent over to undo his leg straps , he fell forward and down almost out of his chute . His ankles caught in the leg straps and this probably saved his life . He hung upside down for quite a while and finally freed himself by swinging back and forth till he caught the trunk of the tree and shinnied up the tree feet first until he had enough slack to free his ankles . By the time he got his feet free , his arms were dead tired and they gave way . The next thing he remembered was one of the natives , who had helped him into our camp , bending over him and bathing his head with water . He said the native had treated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the elephants all harnessed and packed . The leader came up to me and inquisitively pointed to Burkhardt . I supposed he meant , " Is he ready to travel ? " Still thinking that we were going to ride on the elephants , I said , " Yes , " as we were both eager to get started at once . But it turned out that the elephants were only going along to bring back the salt and other things that the natives would get for rescuing us . Only one native rode on the lead elephant 's head , in order to steer him . Burkhardt ended up riding on one , though , for he was quite lame . From his description of the ride afterwards , I was just as glad that I had walked . Ile said he had all he could do to stay on the beast 's back . It was raining buckets and the paths ran either straight up or straight down . The deep mud made the going very hard and it was most discouraging to climb to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was a muddy mess within fifteen minutes and Burkhardt was worse . We finally devised a system , though . We each got di . rectly behind an elephant , and as he plowed through the mud , we followed right in his footsteps before the mud and water had filled them in . I would n't believe that elephants could do what they actually did on that trip if I had n't seen it with my own eyes . Every once in a while we would come to a steep embankment which I would n't have attempted to ascend if it had n't been for my friend " Jumbo , " the elephant I was following , Jumbo would n't hesitate a second . He would jug stick his foot right through the side of the moon . tain , sinking it in about a foot . It was a sight to watch that huge , cumbersome hulk go up the in. cline so swiftly . If Jumbo happened to make a misstep and started to slip , he would immediately drop to his knees , straightening out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself once again , and then wham ! he would stick his front hoof about two feet into the ground and off he would go again . For me it was just like walking up a flight of stairs . If I was a little slow in stepping into his footprints , they were little lakes by the time I reached them , be , cause the rain water ran so swiftly down the hill , This went on all day until dusk , when we stopped off at another little Kachin village , where we were treated just as I had been the night before . 3 THE rain came down in torrents the next day , but we continued on . At dusk we reached the top of the seventh peak , the highest and steepest of Fortunately , this was the last . We descended the other side a short distance and soon came to a dirt road . I was overcome with joy , for there on the road were tire tracks deeply imprinted in the mud ? American jeep tracks . Burkhardt was doing well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had walked up the road a mile or two we heard a jeep approaching . Sure enough , at the next bend there was a sturdy little Willys plowing its way through the mud , which was over the hub of the wheels . A white man was driving ? an Englishman . As soon as he saw as he jumped out of the jeep and ran forward to greet us . After the usual formalities of introductions and such , the Englishman , the little Kachin chief , Burkhardt , and I piled into the jeep and set off for camp . Just as we approached the clearing where the village was situated , we noticed a C-47 overhead It was the weekly " dropping " plane . American troop carrier squadrons dropped bags of rice and other supplies to the villages once a week . The Englishman told us there was an American liaison station near-by , consisting of a five-man radio team , and that supplies for them were also included is that dropping . Then the Englishman gave us the good news that Anderson had arrived there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing , Anderson ran out to meet us . About noon of the next day , a runner brought in the sad news that the co-pilot 's body had been found in a tree . From the native 's description of his chute , we knew it had been riddled with bullets . The news set us back a pace or two and made us realize even more just how lucky we three had been . There were two jeeps at this camp , which we used . to get to Fort Hertz , where a C-47 picked us up and took us back to Chabua. 4 In WAS June now and the monsoon was just starting , so we had rain every day . My three tent mates and I were all equal in Hump trips , which numbered fifty-five by this time . On June 19 , 1944 , we were sitting around playing pinochle and relating a few adventures and celebrating with a bottle of Scotch that some generous pilot had donated to one of the fellows . It was a bit late , but the celebration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age just eight days before . Along about midnight , when the party was really getting gay , the CQ came into the tent and said that I was wanted down at Operations for a trip to Chanyi . The call came as quite a surprise , for it was a terrible night . The rain was coming down in torrents . Looking towards the east , we could see lightning flashing back and forth across the Hump . The one thing that we were all afraid of on this route over the Himalayas was the terrific thunderheads that used to build up . They could crack a plane up just like a matchbox . They were big , ugly black clouds shaped like an anvil . We had all had experience with them before and had sweated out many an hour flying through them . Operations had n't sent anyone over since late that afternoon and they wanted us to try the flight as a weather ship . We were to radio the weather conditions back to the base as we flew across ; and if it got too rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect something was going to happen as soon as I saw the number of the ship we were to take ? 699 . My last two trips had been made in that ship . It was very rare for anyone to make two consecutive trips in the same ship , because we had about forty planes on the field , but to make three in a row was surely a sign of something . I remembered that the only other time I had made two consecutive trips in the same plane was in the unlucky 413 . I also noticed that I had n't been originally picked to make this trip , but the other fellow was reported to be sick , so I had been chosen . I was connecting all sorts of silly superstitions with this trip . I had gone down twice ? in the transport on the way out , and in the 413 ? and it it happened again , it would be the fatal " third time . " As soon as I met the crew and started briefing , I forgot these silly ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) Kimble . The co-pilot was Robert Champlin , and the engineer was Lindegarde . We were all in very good spirits on the way out to the ship and were joking about the weather . The ship checked out perfectly ; and being the only ship to go , we were cleared from the tower to take off at our will . Kimble made a beautiful take-off in spite of the fact that the rain on the windshield practically blinded him . He could n't see twenty yards in front of him . It took about forty-five minutes to reach our cruising altitude of 17,500 feet . We got this by circling the field and then we headed southeast . The sky looked blacker and blacker as we flew along , and the turbulent air caused the ship to pitch and rock . I got the first weather message off with quite a bit of difficulty just as we passed over the first ridge . The lightning was terrific and it lit up the whole ship at every crack . We were all on edge , for we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen . All of a sudden , things started happening . There was a huge crack of lightning that seemed to split the ship in two , and sent it into a terrific dive . Kimble lost control of the ship for a moment , but with Champlin 's help he got it straightened out again . The left engine was cutting out because the carburetor had iced up . Kimble decided to go back and told me to report his decision to the home base . I noticed that the radio compass , which was turned into Myitkyina 's homing beacon , had been pointing directly to our rear ; but as he turned , it straightened around until it was pointed right at the nose of the ship . In other words , we had passed Myitkyina and were now heading back . I tried to get the information back to the base , but with the first compression of the key I could tell something was wrong . As I keyed the transmitter , St .. Elmo ' s fire sparked from all the antennas in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the IFF , which was never supposed to be turned off . If there were any fumes from our load of gas , it would n't take a very big spark to blow us all to kingdom come . And sparks continued to come from one of the antennas . By this time , Kimble had control of the plane only one fourth of the time , and the updrafts and downdrafts were tossing us around like a toothpick . One minute we were at 15,000 , then we would be at 18,000 , and then down to 14,000 . I really started to sweat then . I knew we would never make it back to Chabua , and Myitkyina was in Japanese hands . The left engine finally cut out altogether , and our altimeter started to spin counterclockwise/ This was enough for me . The peaks around Myitkyina varied anywhere from 11,000 to 13,000 feet , and we were down to 14,000 feet already . I undid my safety belt and oxygen hose and went to the rear of the ship for my chute . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got back to the cockpit . Then I saw Kimble tell Lindegarde to start throwing out the load . We began untying the ropes but had n't got far when the right engine started cutting out . Immediately , I thought of the stories I had heard of fellows who got killed trying to save the ship by ditching the load , and I said to myself very selfishly , " This is n't for you , kid ? get out while the getting 's good . " I decided that if Kimble did n't give the word to jump within the next minute , I would take one piece of cargo to the door and go out with it . I was really scared at that point . I knew we were going to jump for sure . The thought that kept racing through my mind was " What ? Not again ! " I remembered the terrific jolt I got the last time I jumped , so I checked my chest strap and it seemed tight enough . The ship was in a terrific dive again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the door , and also seeing Champlin leave his seat and start for the rear where we were , I suddenly got the overwhelming desire to get out of that plane as fast as I could . Lindegarde had the door unlatched , so I stuck my hand in the crack , shoved the door open , and jumped out into space . I pulled my rip cord immediately and the same thing happened as before ? the chest strap came up and cut my neck and I slipped out of the seat . I felt as if the leg straps would cut me in two . 5 IT WAS black as black could be and pouring rain . The winds were terrific . Every now and then a gust of wind would catch my chute , collapse it , and drop me in a free fall of four or five hundred feet . Then my chute would catch again . This happened about six times , and every time I felt that little initial gust of wind I would become petrified with the thought that the chute might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , wherever it was . I could n't see my hand in front of my face ? and what a helpless feeling that was ! I felt like a piece of paper in a hurricane ? as if I were being blown all over the sky . I heard the ship roaring around somewhere until finally the right engine quit altogether . Then all was quiet . I saw a huge red glow appear below me and then heard a terrific explosion ? the ship had hit . I prayed that the other fellows had followed right behind me . The night seemed to get blacker and blacker . It was just like dropping into a big well . I won dered whether I would hit a mountain or land in the jungle or in a river . Jumping at night is n't so easy as in the daytime . I could n't get my bearings and would n't know which way to head to the nearest water . I might even land just beside a village and not knowing it was there , walk right away from it As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished one of my free falls , I suddenly crashed through treetops . I halted abruptly and hung there in space . I could n't feel the ground with my feet and I could n't feel anything but little twigs with my hands . I was caught in a tree and my Ilea felt as if it had been broken . Now that I was no longer falling , I managed to pull myself up into the seat of the chute . I immediately gave a prayer of thanks . How lucky I had been to get out alive again . I began to worry about the other fellows . Did they jump in time ? Kimble was still fighting the controls when I left . I was soaked to the skin by now and feeling quite miserable about the whole thing . Had I done right in jumping without actually being told to ? Maybe the other fellows felt that I had deserted them . I was alive and they might be lying dead somewhere near-by . This thought haunted me . Then I thought back a few hours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sitting there having a swell time , and here I was hanging out on a limb , like so much laundry , in the middle of Burma . I tried to light my cigarette lighter to see just how I was situated , but it was too wet , so I just resigned myself to that position until dawn . When daybreak came at last , I saw that I was hanging from a tree about twenty-five feet from the ground , on a very steep mountainside . The large trees in Burma go straight up for thirty or forty feet without a single branch . They sprout out very thickly from there on up , and look somewhat like a feather duster . My predicament was that the chute was caught on the lowest branch and I was about six feet from the trunk of the tree , which was five times as big around as I was . Even if I did get ova to the trunk , I would never be able to get my arms around it to shinny down . But I could n't hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started swinging myself by pulling on the shroud lines . I would either pull myself free from tie branch by the momentum or else I would swing over and try to grab the tree trunk . I worked up to a pretty good arc and tried to catch hold of the trunk . After several unsuccessful attempts , I caught hold of a piece of bark and clung to the tree for dear life . I managed to get a haphazard foothold in the bark with my toes . had undone my chest strap and one leg strap during the night . With a great deal of difficulty , I now got my other leg strap undone . I held onto the chest strap with my teeth and unzipped my Jo- &; kit , which was in my chute seat pack . I threw all the contents of the jungle kit onto the groan &; After emptying it , I let it swing back out into space . I had no sooner made one movement to climb down the tree when I immediately lost my grip . With a crash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very solid ground of the Himalayas . surprisingly enough I was n't hurt badly . I had hit a small bush and it broke my fall . All I suffered from the rapid descent was a turned ankle and a very sore rear end . Well , that was one way of doing it , and at least I was on solid earth again . I gathered the contents of my jungle kit and spread them over my person . As I picked up the package of .45 shells , I looked down and saw that me revolver was missing from the holster . My only weapon was the machete from the jungle kit . I could hear water rushing near-by and decided to head in that direction , as I figured it would be easier to walk in the stream than through the smothering jungle . There was quite a steep embankment going down to the stream , which was completely covered with undergrowth . As I hacked my way through this brush , I suddenly broke into a clearing of the stream , and the quick change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand and into the stream . I had lost the implement that I needed most of all . I tried desperately to recover it , but all my efforts were in vain . The going was n't too bad at first , but I soon came to places where the stream dropped straight down for thirty or forty feet , forcing me to go up and around through the jungle . Then I had to break the vines and branches with my hands and they soon were a bloody mess . I was soaked to the skin from rain and perspiration , but I did n't want to discard any of my clothing , for I thought it would probably get quite cold that night . Dusk approached very unexpectedly and caught me off guard . I managed to find a spot sheltered by a fallen tree , where I built a fire and ate a supper of chocolate and water . Then I doctored myself up a little with iodine and soon fell into a heavy slumber . With the coming of dawn , I got a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it nearly killed me to open them . When I started to flex them , all the scratches and cuts opened up again . But in spite of all , I ate some more chocolate , swallowed a quinine tablet , and started again . The same groping , stumbling progress continued on for the next three days . After my chocolate ran out I ate water cress , bamboo shoots , banana stalks , different types of grass and leaves that I could never identify , a few tropical berries , and even some sort of bug that did n't turn out to be so delicious as the little " survival pamphlet " had described it to be . My matches held out quite well , and I managed to have a fire each night . The fourth day I got a terrific case of dysentery , which slowed me down almost to a standstill . I was terribly discouraged that fourth night . I had been traveling northeast the whole time without running across the faintest sign of civilization . I thought I would spend the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle . By this time , my whole body was covered with sores and cuts but they did n't bother me . I just felt numb and tired and hungry . I knew it would n't be long before a dose of malaria would hit me , since I already had a fever and my quinine had run out with the chocolate . My brain was dull and I could n't think clearly . I felt that I had walked my last step . I fell on my face and buried my head in my arms . I was awake long before dawn , and lying there waiting for daybreak I prayed over and over that I would come to a path before it was too late . My clothes felt as if they weighed a ton , and they were awfully wet and muddy . My body was racked with fever and yet I felt as if I would freeze any moment . My head was spinning like a top . I took about ten groping steps and suddenly came upon a small clearing . I fell on my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to kiss the ground . I had found a path at last ! I had spent the night ten yards from my first sign of civilization . 6 Tie question now was which way to go ? up or down . Remembering that the Kachins were hill dwellers , I decided to go north up the path . I could n't travel fast enough . I stumbled along up the mountain for an hour or so , passing familiar objects of Kachin life along the way . As I rounded a bend in the path , I suddenly came upon a typical Kachin village . Saved at last ! I took two steps and then I froze in my tracks . There , hanging on the end of the closest building , was one of the small Japanese flags that every " Son of Nippon " carries . I did n't know what to do . However , I do n't recall seeing a thing happen . I passed out as soon as I lay down in the underbrush . The next thing I knew I was being carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? Japs or Kachins ? just as long as someone took care of me . I do n't know how far they carried me , but it seemed to be quite a distance . We finally came to a halt at a little cave which was just above and to one side of the path . It seemed to be a girl 's voice that gave all the orders . I went out cold again as soon as they laid me down . It was late the next afternoon when I was awakened by a young native girl who was trying to feed me some rice and curry . I ate everything they brought on this time , as weak as I was . I was famished , and malaria or no malaria , I was going to eat . The large meal made me sleepy , so out I went again . I woke up the next morning just in time to see the same native girl giving a young Kachin boy some sort of instructions . I saw the boy start up the hill , and thinking no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all of a sudden I saw a larger man , a Jap , step out in front of the boy . It all happened so quickly that it 's hard to describe . The young Kachin , who could n't have been over twelve years old , whipped out his Gurkha knife , slashed the Jap a mortal blow , and disappeared over the hill . The Jap went down without a murmur . Presently natives carried the body away and hid all signs of a scuffle and then moved on . No one visited me during the daytime and I was told that the Jap patrols were out looking for the crew of the plane that had been found . I was thirty miles behind Jap lines and was in the hands of a system similar to the underground in France . However , Miora Misko , the young native girl , who spoke very plain English , stayed with me ' way into the night , talking about all sorts of things . The daughter of a Japanese Army officer and a Burmese woman , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years . It was she who had sent the boy for quinine . He returned the next day and she started me off with two tablets about every four hours . She made me some clothes out of an old parachute , and gave me a little shoulder bag for carrying my belongings . After ten days , things began to pop . Miora said the Japs knew I was in this neighborhood and were beginning to close in . I was feeling a lot better , so she told me that I must move on . My guide was the young boy who had massacred the Jap . The first night we stayed at Walabum . Word of my coming must have been sent ahead , for they had everything ready for me . They had my escape well planned with runners ahead and behind us all the time to give warning if Japs were approaching . All we did was step off the trail twenty or thirty paces and hide in the brush until the patrols passed . It all went off so smoothly that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Around noon the next day , the going got real tough and I sat down on the path exhausted . As any little guide stood there trying to persuade me to move on , a native came running down the hill with a bamboo tube in his hand . He handed me the tube and when the liquid touched my lips I tasted something very familiar and delicious . This water was mixed with D-ration chocolate ! I felt like a new man ? I knew that an American was near . The native pointed to me , holding up one finger , and then pointed toward the hill and held up another finger . I practically flew up the hill and there saw a white man sitting by a brook washing his feet . I gave a yell and ran forward to meet him . It was Kimble . He had barely escaped from the doomed plane . When he ran back to jump he found the door closed . He tore his hands to shreds trying to find the handle but finally succeeded and toppled out backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds later , with the ship crashing on the mountain at the same time . His face was banged up and he had a ter . rible cut on his leg . His experience with the natives followed right along the lines of mine . We sat and talked a while , wondering what had become of our other two comrades . Then we no. tired that the natives were ' getting rather impatient and we pushed on feeling jubilant at our reunion . The next day we arrived at the mighty Mall River , which was much higher than the natives expected it to be from the heavy monsoon rain . Around noon of the following day another small party joined us , and much to my delight , Undo . garde was with them . He had really had it rough He had been punctured in the crotch by his fall , and had been in the jungle for nine days . I thought the leeches had done a job on me until I saw him . That night Kimble and I picked forty-five maggots out of his cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the natives built rafts out of long pieces of bamboo . On the morning of July 5 , three rafts were completed . The river did n't seem to be going down at all and the Japs were closing in behind us , so we decided to try to cross the river . We had crossed the worst part of the current when we lost control of our little craft , so we all jumped over . board and swam to shore . In swimming ten feet to shore , we were carried more than thirty yards down the river . The next day at about noon we came to Supka , an English first-aid station . We met some swell Englishmen there and became very good friends with a Captain Walker , who said he could spare a jeep for us . He had sent a radio message to Amer. ican headquarters giving our present status . Ar . rangements were made for a small plane to pick us up in two days at a little strip called Tingpai , which was about fifty miles up the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fort Hertz in the little plane , and as I looked down at that winding , turning , climbing , descending road , I gave a sigh of relief that we did not have to hike it to Fort Hertz . At Fort Hertz there was a C47 waiting to take us back to Chabua and a good meal Now that we were so close to home it seemed as if that C-47 were standing still . It was only another hour and a half , but it seemed more like twenty four hours before Chabua 's runway lights came into view . We were a sight to behold as we stepped off the plane to be greeted by our comrades . We all had heavy beards and our hair was over our ears . I was still wearing the outfit that Miora had made for me , and Lindegarde was really sharp with his ripped khakis exposing his leech-bitten legs . None of this mattered though , because we were so happy to be back .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
