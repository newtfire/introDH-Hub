The meaningful point is whether the President learns from them , and how fast he learns . That is the question today about Jimmy Carter . He has had his first seminar with the Soviet Union . More will follow . <P> " ... His predecessors all had indelible lessons . Harry Truman , recalls Clark Clifford , his principal aide , spent his first year believing that Uncle Joe Stalin might be a lot like other tough politicians whom Truman had known .
