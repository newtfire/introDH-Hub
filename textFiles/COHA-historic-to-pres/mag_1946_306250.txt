In 10,000 words ( some of them ambiguous ) , Economic Stabilizer Chester Bowles this week told industry what the new wage-price policy really means . The clarification still left vast areas of fog . The policy does not mean , said Bowles , that the 18-an-hour steel increase is to be the pattern for U.S. industry . Nor does it mean that a wage boost , alone , is enough to get a corresponding boost in price ceilings . But the policy did mean , he said , that companies can now get prompt price relief if 1 ) they have been squeezed into the red by rising wages and low ceilings or 2 ) a forecast of earnings indicates that profits will fall below the 1936-39 period . <P> Said Bowles cheerfully : " The new policy means quicker settlement of wage problems . It means prompt price relief where hardship exists . . . . It means that the way is cleared for all-out production . " What was more to the point , he finally admitted what businessmen have been wearily saying : OPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industry , including household furniture , low-cost clothing and household appliances . <P> Production has been stymied because it is unprofitable . ( General Electric , for example , says it was losing $4 on every washing machine it made before the strike . ) Now , presumably , these industries can expect that further increases in costs will be passed on to consumers . <P> Up in the Air . But on wages , the new policy left employers right where they were-up in the air . Bowles said that each case will be considered on its merits . A different " pattern " of increases will be set for each industry . The general objective will be to let wages rise 33% above 1941 . However , wage increases not approved by the National Wage Stabilization Board can not be used as a basis for a price increase . Thus the red tape which now tangles wages , prices and production looked just as snarled as ever . <P> Nevertheless , in marked contrast to his truculence towards businessmen only a few days before , Bowles showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the National Farmers Union in Topeka , Kans. and tonguelashed the " irresponsible , reckless , greedy organizations who opposed price control . . . the National Association of Manufacturers . . . the heads of the National Retail Dry Goods Association with all the phony propaganda . . . the real estate lobbies . . . the packers ' lobby and textile lobby . " <P> If he was trying to get a rise , he got one . N.R.D.G.A. 's President Benjamin H. Namm shouted right back . The Association , said he , " does not seek an end to price control . " What the Association did want was to change the way price control worked , notably many of the things which Bowles himself now admitted needed changing . <P> Down to Earth . To step up production of low-cost cotton materials and clothing , OPA granted textile mills increases which will bring them $250,000,000 more a year , add 5 to 15% to the prices of shirts , shorts , etc . OPA also gave a price boost to makers of men 's &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , waiting for just such an increase , may put them on the market .
