When America last saw David Addison and Maddie Hayes , things seemed to be coming to a head for the sparring detectives and almost lovers of ABC 's Moonlighting . Maddie ( Cybill Shepherd ) has a dashing new boyfriend ( Mark Harmon ) , but realizes that David ( Bruce Willis ) is jealous . Will the two finally get together ? If the show 's fans are holding their breath for an answer , they may turn blue before it arrives . The four-part episode that is supposed to resolve the problem began airing on Feb. 3 . Seven weeks and four repeat episodes later , the conclusion is still to be seen . <P> Like a fifth-grader caught without his homework , Moonlighting has plenty of excuses . In the midst of filming the multi-parter , Willis broke his collarbone on a Sun Valley ski slope and was absent three days . Another two weeks ' worth of shooting was lost while Shepherd , who is expecting twins in October , was fighting off morning sickness . Those misfortunes only complicated the show 's chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at least 22 new episodes a season ; Moonlighting will be lucky to scrape together 17 . Its scripts are often finished just a few hours before shooting starts , and some episodes have even wound up short , forcing the writers to invent an extra scene to fill the time  --  usually just the two stars vamping before the camera to " introduce " the segment . <P> Is this any way to run a TV series ? Maybe not , but since its debut two years ago , Moonlighting has moved up steadily in the ratings to its current No. 9 spot . The show 's success is Executive Producer Glenn Gordon Caron 's best response to charges that his work habits are undisciplined . " It sounds pompous , " says Caron , " but maybe it 's irresponsible to bring a television show in on time and on budget every week and have it be about nothing . " <P> At first glance , Moonlighting is n't about much . The mystery plots are slight and derivative : so many bogus suicides and murders have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Remake Vertigo . " But Shepherd , as the straitlaced ice queen , and Willis , as the wisecracking clod-with-a- heart-of-gold , are a screen team to treasure . Despite some straining this season , the writers have managed to deepen and develop their relationship without losing the comic fizz . And no other series takes more chances . The actors frequently step out of character for asides to the camera , and the show may break completely from format on a whim . One of this season 's episodes featured a seven-minute Gene Kellyesque dance number . Another was an elaborate parody of The Taming of the Shrew done in Elizabethan costume and mock iambic pentameter . <P> Such inventiveness does not come cheap . The Taming of the Shrew segment cost a reported $3 million  --  nearly twice the show 's usual $1.6 million an episode , already well above average for an hour show . Because of the ultrafast dialogue , scripts average 95 pages , compared with about 60 for a typical TV hour , and take ten to twelve days to shoot ( eight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , can be traced to Caron , 32 , a portly ex-writer for Remington Steele . Co-workers describe him as a perfectionist who thrives on working close to deadlines and asking for last-minute major changes . The six staff writers have learned to cope with life on the edge . Says one : " When we get a couple of days ahead of the camera , it 's time to take a long lunch . "
