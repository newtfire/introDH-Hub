Vr ) 411 , - THE MAN WHO KNEW EVERYBODY A STORY BY HAROLD NICOLSON M R. BENINGSEN , as I now realize , spoke with an English accent . At the time ( being ignorant of such matters ) I imagined that his intonation was that of New England . Those elongated vowels , those stressed consonants , suggested to me Beacon Hill rather than Oxford ; Rhode Island rather than Mayfair . " More unimaginable , " he would say when speaking of Persepolis , " than can be conceived . " The last syllable of " conceived " prolonged itself with the insistence of a factory siren , its final " d " cutting dentally across his ululation , producing a silence as abrupt as that which follows upon some distant hoot at nighttime . I was much impressed by this New England accent on the part of Mr. Beningsen . And one afternoon , riding among the sand hills by Shimran , I confessed to the second secretary of the United States Legation how instructive , and withal traditional , I considered Mr. Beningsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " What an idea ! Why he comes from Utah . He adopts an English accent because he thinks it tony . " " Thinks it what ? " I asked him . " Tony , " he answered , leaving me still confused . Mr. Beningsen was a man of wide acquaintanceship , precise culture , and the utmost gentility . The orbit  --  the almost cosmic orbit  --  of his personal relationships was conveyed to one by Mr. Beningsen with a mastery which to this day compels my admiration . Others might adopt the crude gambit of referring to the eminent of three continents by their actual or , in extreme cases , by their Christian names . Not so Julius Beningsen . He would not directly mention either Mr. Andrew Mellon , Lord Curzon , Mr. Ezra Pound , M. Salomon Reinach , Prince Billow , Marinetti , Tagore , Lyautey , or Nagaoka . The thick pile of addressed envelopes which would accumulate during the week in his neat Berber basket , in anticipation of Friday 's outward mail , would be arranged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to his sister at Pasadena . " Miss Amy Beningsen , " one would read , " R110 Colorado Avenue , Pasadena , California , Etats Unis . " Yet one was well aware that behind that domestic covering lurked envelopes addressed to Mussolini , Elsa Maxwell , Lord Willingdon , and Madame de Polignac . Only on carefully selected occasions would Julius Beningsen lift for one second the discreet veil which separated his neat and modest foreground from the palatial brocades with which his background was so lavishly draped . " Yes , " he would murmur , " I also saw that statement in the Reuter telegrams this morning . It may well be true . I had a cable yesterday from Mr. Morgan , asking me to join the yacht at Villefranche toward the end of next month . It is quite possible that he may be stopping off in London and Paris on the way . Yet I question whether he can have been charged with any semi-official mission on the part of the present administration . My more recent information from Washington points rather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the unindicated summits of his Washington correspondence . " Yes , " Mr. Beningsen would be saying a few minutes later , " middle Achaemenid , not in a very perfect state , " indicating thereby the precision of his culture . " You will , " he would add , " take a second cup of tea ? " indicating thereby the extent of his gentility . Inevitably the conversation would drift towards Persepolis , from which encumbered parapet Mr. Beningsen had only recently returned . " More unimaginable , " he would murmur , " than can well be conceived . " For Mr. Beningsen had been sent to Persia , was even then at Teheran , as a representative of the Metropolitan Museum . Invariably would he pronounce that word " museum " in the English way . He smoked Maryland cigarettes which he obtained from Paris ; to his guests he would offer Balkan Sobranye direct from London . There would be scones for tea and little pots of Tiptree jam . The tea parties of Mr. Beningsen filled his compatriots at the American Legation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that behind the reticence , the disguises , of Julius Beningsen there was nothing at all . My interest in him was by no means diminished by this discovery . During the period when I regarded Julius Beningsen as an authentic person I had looked upon him with anxious awe . Once I had attained to a conviction of his fraudulence I studied him with an entrancedinterest . On those rare occasions when European travelers would come to Persia I made it a point to invite Beningsen to meet them . With delight I would observe the skill with which , always indirectly , he would indicate to them that triumphant background . With cold delight would I observe the phases through which they passed . Few were the intellectual interludes allowed to one in Persia ; my examination of Julius Beningsen became for me a pastime of which I never tired . After some eight months of unflagging experiment I came to the conclusion that the two most exquisitely imaginative of all Julius Beningsen 's autobiographical disclosures were those which dealt respectively with Andre Gide and Oscar Wilde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since one had only to mention Mauriac , and thereafter Proust for a bit , and thus by a natural transition one arrived at l'Immoraliste . " Yes , " Beningsen would murmur , thrusting his arm to full length and gazing intently at the Maryland held upwards between thumb and forefinger , " yes  --  there is l ' Immoratiste of course  --  and the Porte EtraiteI admit them both  --  yet one has one 's preferences  --  Paiudes , for instance . . . " He would pause when he reached Paludes , hoping that one would press him further . " And the Nourritures TerrestresP " one would inquire nonchalantly . It was at that moment that the most exquisite of all Beningsen 's hallucinations would descend upon him . He would admit a tiny little laugh , dry and apologetic . " Well , perhaps , " he would answer . " I can scarcely be classed as an unbiased judge of Les Nourritures . " At which he would repeat his little laugh , conveying with the subtlety of infinite practice that the embarrassment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , that the indelicacy of the question was one which , in the crude circumstances of your ignorance , he was prepared to forgive . A pregnant pause would follow , which Beningsen would end abruptly by flinging his cigarette towards the fireplace . " It might interest you , " he would say , " to see some Raghes fragments which I have recently acquired . " Yet the reproach which he had managed to convey hung like the smoke of his extinguished Maryland upon the air . One was conscious that in asking Beningsen about the Nourritures Terresties one had probed too deep into the arcana of his personal past , that in clumsy ignorance one had touched upon some still exposed nerve , upon a nerve sensitively yet gloriously exposed to immortality . Only a moron could fail to derive from this elaborately rehearsed ceremonial the impression that some twenty years ago Beningsen had inspired Andre Gide to write the Naurritures . One had before one an elderly archaeologist of exquisite manners , against an immediate background of indifferent Turcoman embroideries and littered shards . Yet behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a vital Parisian past . The effect upon the cultured newcomer of this half-disclosure was electric : I would lie back upon the divan hugging myself with pleasure at the sheer artistry of Beningsen 's fraudulence . The Oscar Wilde story , for its part , was less expressionist and more precise . It could be evoked by the direct method . The newcomer could be primed in advance to ask Beningsen whether , during his period at the South Kensington in the early nineties , he had been at all intimate with Oscar Wilde . " No , " he would answer . " No  --  I never knew Wilde during those days . In fact I never saw him . Curiously enough the only time that I saw him was some eight , or it may have been nine , years after his death . " Therewould be a pause at this filled to the brim with implicit inquiry . Beningsen , who until then had been leaning back in a deck chair , would gather his thin legs under him and crouch over his own joined knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were some medicinal herb . " Yes , " he would continue , " it was extremely painful . " During the pause that followed , he would gather himself up more tightly over his own crouch . And then , in accents of the utmost refinement , he would embark upon his story . " Poor Wilde , as you may remember , died in circumstances of comparative poverty in the H6tel d'Alsace . He was buried in a suburban cemetery in the banlieu . In 1908 a lady who much admired his work , and deeply regretted the dishonor which had been done to him , bequeathed a large sum of money whereby this dishonor might be posthumously repaired . This reparation , as you shall see , was vividly ? " ( and here Beningsen would pause for an exquisite moment , shaping his lips to give full length and emphasis to the ensuing word ) posthumnus . " At this stage he would be apt to fling himself back into his chair with a gesture of distaste . " No , " he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . I have no liking myself for the macabre . " His auditors would urge him to continue . Again he would assume that crouching position . " Well .. . " he would begin . It was obvious that in spite of his repudiation of the macabre he enjoyed the story immensely . It seems that in order that the remains of Wilde might be removed from his suburban cemetery to the more enlightened splendors of Pere Lachaise an exhumation order had been obtained . It seems that the transference of the coffin from one cemetery to the other had been regarded by the Ministry of Public Instruction as an oc-casion demanding discreet but laudable official notice . The gravediggers had been working overnight , they had removed the tombstone and dug down to the coffin , under which they had placed bands with the aid of which , at the fitting moment , the coffin might be raised to the upper air . A group of some twelve people had gathered that morning beside the open grave . " I have , " said Beningsen , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should be wounding people who were very dear to me were I to refuse to attend . " He had thus been one of the twelve who gathered by the grave-side . There had been a few chosen words from an official of the Ministry . The little group pressed closer to the edge . The gravediggers began to strain upon their bands . The coffin below them jerked slightly and then began to rise . And at that one of the tombstones which had been placed to the side of the grave was dislodged by the strain of the band which passed across its surface . It fell upon the coffin and split it open . It was in this manner that Beningsen had obtained a glimpse of Oscar Wilde . The rest of the story was too harrowing to be recorded . Beningsen 's slim freckled fingers would clutch the air as be searched for the most telling epithets . He found them . It would be with a sense of magnificent horror that we bade him good-night . I remember particularly driving back one night under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had come up from Baghdad . He had been much impressed , as I had hoped , by Beningsen 's recitation . " Gosh , " he exclaimed , " what an interesting man ! What I mean is , he 's seen such a lot , and yet he does n't boast about it ; one has to drag it all out . . . " " Yes , " I answered , " Beningsen 's an artist in his way . An artist in fraudulence . " " You mean it was n't true ? " " Of course it was n't true  --  the whole thing is an elaborate and , I admit , convincing daydream . " I was so convinced of Beningsen 's fraudulence that it never occurred to me to verify even those of his reticences which it would have been easy for me to control . A few days before I left Teheran I rode round to his little house among the plane trees to bid him farewell . He was not in at the moment , and his servant asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a copy of the Nourritures Terrestres . " A Julius Beningsen , " I read , " de in part de son ami Andre Gide . " And underneath I read as follows in the same handwriting . " Je sais maintenant qui etait Nathaniel . " When Beningsen entered , I gazed at him with a wild surmise . Some months later I was dining at my club in London . They were talking of the early work of Epstein , and someone mentioned the Wilde memorial in Pere Lachaise . An old gentleman who was present stated that he much admired that monument but that it was associated in his mind with one of the most ghastly episodes in his experience . " I was present , " he added glumly , " at the exhumation . It was a most distressing affair . " It was then that I heard the same story again . " Tell me , " I said to him afterwards , " at that exhumation  --  was there a man there of the name of Beningsen ? " " You mean Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I wish now that I had not forced him to come . He hated it . Yet I felt somehow that an American of his standing  --  you see Wilde would have been pleased . But I felt sorry for Beningsen . He minded more than the others . "
