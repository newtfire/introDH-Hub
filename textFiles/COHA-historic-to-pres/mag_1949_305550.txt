In 1857 , the Rev. Cyrus Hamlin of Bangor , Me. took off for the Turkish province of Bulgaria . His instructions : " The people needs to be taught to read , hear and reflect . " Few did more to teach Bulgarians to read and to reflect than Cyrus Hamlin and his Protestant missionary friends . They translated the New Testament into Bulgarian and helped bring out the first periodical in the Bulgarians ' native tongue . When the Turks massacred Bulgarian rebels in 1876 , it was the missionaries ' protests that did much to make Bulgarian liberation into a world cause . After the liberation in 1878 , the missionaries stayed on to form centers of Western thought in the Greek Orthodox state . <P> " The Real Culprit . " The 15 Protestant pastors who sat in Sofia 's courtroom accused of espionage and black-marketeering ( TIME , March 7 ) were the spiritual descendants of the same U.S. missionaries . As their trial wore on , it became plain that the pastors were being tried solely because of their Western traditions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendants ' lawyers joined in denouncing " American imperialism as the real culprit on trial . " <P> The pastors , broken in pretrial examinations , had " confessed . " Said the Rev. Zdravko Beglov : " The last three months were not the most agreeable of my life , but they were the most useful . I read 12,000 pages of progressive literature . The security police 's attitude was one of trying to explain to me that I was misguided . " <P> The pastors ' lawyers also plugged their clients ' cultural guilt as proof that they had been led astray . Intoned one : " The defendants were not only obedient tools , they were ideologically convinced tools . The defendants are victims of a foreign influence . " Another made it even plainer where his sympathies really lay . " My client , " he said , " is a weak-willed person who sold out to the Anglo-Americans . I ask for one year in prison for my client . If he does not like the way I am defending him , he ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abundant Evidence . " Thus cheered on by the defense , Prosecutor Dimiter Georgiev saw no reason to prolong the trial . He produced no documentary evidence of the espionage charge and cut his witnesses short . Said he : " The evidence is abundant and clear . " He demanded the death penalty for four of the defendants , heavy prison terms for the others . <P> Last week Presiding Judge Konstantin Undzhiev pronounced sentence . Because of the " pastors ' honest and sincere confessions , " said Undzhiev , he had waived the death penalty . The four principal defendants-the heads of Bulgaria 's Congregational , Baptist , Methodist and Pentecostal churches-got life imprisonment ; nine of their associates drew prison terms ranging from five to 15 years , and two got off with suspended sentences . <P> The Western tradition would be suspended in Bulgaria for a while .
