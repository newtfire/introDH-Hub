... when they draw near forty men seem to undergo a sort of spiritual change of life , with really painful depression and loss of energy . Even men whose physical health is quite good . So do n't fret .... Often an entire change of scene helps a lot . But it 's a condition which often drags over several years . Then in the end you come out with a new sort of rhythm , a new psychic rhythm , a sort of re-birth . Meanwhile it is what the mystics call a little death and you have to put up with it .... -D . H. LAWRENCE to Mark Gertler , December 23,1929 JUNE 23 , 1939-1 HEARD THE VOICE of the Brute on the wireless last night pouring poison into the hearts of his countrymen . It was awful , like wild beasts .... I much prefer the . As though it were yesterday . In front of the house on Gun Street , Spitalfields , a pavement artist turns his wrist and wields the chalk to make a rooster so real to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Only forty-five some years ago . And now . Bleeding-once last night-five times yesterday . And all the air in all the sanatoriums . I breathed . Coughing up clots the size of hummingbirds I saw once in France . In summer . In . Stripping the bed and breathing in the familiar odors of oils and the haunting residue of Marias last visit . Poor gifted dear . Running from the beasts . Going to the desk . Glad that I saved . Reading Lawrence 's letter again ... thinking , I tried change of scene . The photograph ? Marjorie and me at the beach just after we married ... The waves lapping . Please do put on your bathing costume , please do come in with me . Reading while she splashes about . Longtemps , je me suis couch de bonne heure .... I loved gazing at the sea . An intense blue with hot green trees silhouetted against it . The crude greens of the earth , the ultramarine of the sea , and the sunlit whites of the cliff , clear cut and solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a life , as if it has absorbed all the nights entrusted to it , so heavy to haul this into the middle of the room , to begin ... I 've hauled canvas , hauled stretchers , wood for frames . But this ... The body is the hulk that follows the paintings around . Oh , for the life of a labourer ! A chalk artist , working his wrist ... Coughing lightly . Fearing more to come . Coughing stops . Stop coughing , Mama saying . Asking , What kind of work is that , painting , for a Jewish boy ? Faintest recollection , old Spitalfields rabbi-forgot his name-saying , What kind of a Jew makes painting ? Painting is idol worship . Painting rooms ... would he have said that ? But instead , at an early age , the Slade . Changed everything . Boy genius , a charity case , discovering the masters . Czanne ... When later that critic called me the Yiddish Czanne , it stung me , made me angry , yet somehow half-pleased .... Angry again now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clots forming in my lungs ... Picture the Slade instead , the hallways redolent of oil and paint , seeing ... for the first time ... Her head ... Carrington ! Carrington ! How beautiful , the first ... Wasted years on her , but painting , painting . With the charity of the Jews and the help of . Oh , and then she . With Strachey , of all . A queer , instead of a Jew . Brings back a few days before Christmas in their rooms at the Triangle-was it " 14 , " 15 ? Lawrence and Frieda and Katherine and her old Murray ... and **39;2416;TOOLONG it aloud ... Frieda put up some mistletoe . Wonderful pagan rite , Lawrence said , with a sneer of a smile . Me saying to Katherine , Come with me , come . Taking her hand , leading her into the hall and kissing her . A little tipsy . Where is New Zealand ? I said . Is it here ? I touched her breast . Where is it ? Is it here ? I slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could feel the heat rushing ... And her face , too , hot , hot ! The mistletoe , I said . Under the spell ... I touched her there again , and she did not flinch but did not cleave to me either . Hauling the ... Stopping to breathe . When we came back into the room , Frieda saying , Gertler , look at your face ! Murray , drunk , saying , Look at mine ! Lawrence looking at Frieda , smiling at me , suddenly crowing , Cock-a-doodledoo ! Me , in all merriment , crowing , Cock-a-doodle-Jew ! Cock-a-doodle-Jew ! All of them taking it up . Cock-a-doodle-Jew ! Cock-a-doodle-Jew ! That husband of Katherine 's , oblivious to everything except his own deviousness , put something on the gramophone and we danced about , crowing all the while . Still a bit out of breath . Sitting here a moment , the mattress at my feet ... Oh , oh , Gertler ... Lawrence so out of breath he could scarcely speak . Do you know ? he said . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Do you know-leaning way over to one side , as if this , in his inebriated state , might allow him to commune better with me in mine-Christ himself is the cock ? The early Christians , they made the cock the sign for Christ . The cock crowing at dawn announcing the new day , the advent of Christ , the new Jew replacing the old , announcing a new life . Cock-a-doodle-Jew ! Cock-a-doodle-Jew ! Oh , and we laughed and laughed , and the others laughed , because in that small room of his and Frieda 's there was no room for confidential speech , and there was , after all , all the crowing ! The Jew comes to announce , Lawrence said . All right , then , I said . Enough of this Jew business . You 've heard enough of it ? It 's funny , comical , but then . Oh , he likes you , Katherine said . She looked at me directly for the first time since we had kissed . And Eliot ? And Forster ? I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing is secret . But that all came later , I 'm ... confusing , conflating ... Ottoline , oh , Ottoline . She was good to . Never a mention of Jew . Just gossip about this , gossip about that . And always encouraging . Finding me buyers . But came the rise of the monster on the other side of the Channel . We may all be blown to bits any moment , so why fear gossip ? Gossip is life . They talk about the living more than the dead . Be glad . Celebrate .... Mother 's voice ... Painting ? You want painting ? Sighing ... Breathing easier now . And so back to work . Work ? Oh , work no more the heat of the ... Mattress onto the window seat . I 've read about . Look out there . Reminds me of , green . Early summer at Lyme Regis ... But the awful mists , the air so heavy and liverish . Dorset , really . So much better . Hardy receiving me in the study . Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old man he was . A stale odour of sweat and tobacco circled about him like a wreath . But the books , still alive . And paintings ? Oh yes , they live on , like my Merry-Go-Round , rolled up in the corner there . Studio closed . Because I 'm not there . Wherever 1.1 am my own studio . Breathing comes hard , lifting this mattress . Coughing suddenly . Set it down . Taking some breaths . Hefting it again , easing it upright against the window . Steady . The trouble is-my work . What is my value as an artist ? What have I in me , after all , besides the bloody clots ? Gertler , his blood period . Like Picasso , his blue . Whom I never . Though always wanted to . When we crossed to France that time , the master sent me a note : Come see me . But I thought , No , he 'll merely be tossing me a crust from his table . Unrolling the canvas . A great painting , they all said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orange helmet of a rooftop , sixteen riders , soldiers and sailors and camp followers riding white horses as they scream ... Taking me back to that time . Carrington and me going around and around . And the world going around and around , the tyrants , the dictators , the soldiers , the A bell ! Who is ringing ? Maria ! Oh , God of my ancestors , no ! I told her not . Hurry now . Holding the mattress in place . Maria 's face . Body pressed against . Breath pushed out of me . If only it had been . If we had met earlier . All right . Steady it . Steady . Good . Step away . It still holds . Good . Breathing , breathing . To the burners . Opening up the gas . At last ! Lying here now . Thinking of dinner last month . Woolf said , after I had described to her the first time I tried-oh , what ? - six years ago . Woolf said , Oh , how very interesting . The hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it , darling ? her husband said . Get up now , stuff towels under the doorway . Will it be a surprise to her ? Listen to me . So calm . And the hiss . Bell again . Maria ca n't get in the downstairs door . So now I just wait . Shame about the mattress , blocking the view . I 'd have liked to look at my last green . Carrington 's head on the grass . In Strachey 's lap . I saw her . How could she have ? So devastated , she . Once more the bell . Stay calm . She ca n't . She 'll walk away . And Luke ? Where is little Luke ? With his mother . Will grow up better without . Ay ! Thoughts driving me . Gas seeping . Just a matter of . Must distract myself . Look at . On the shelf , here it is . One evening of late summer , before the nineteenth century had reached one-third of its span , a young man and woman , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Weydon-Priors , in Upper Wessex , on foot . They were plainly but not ill clad , though the thick hoar of dust which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from an obviously long journey lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their appearance just now . Ah , yes , the first old green time . The man was of fine figure , swarthy , and stern in aspect ; and he showed in profile a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost perpendicular . Coughing a bit . Coughing , then settling down . He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy , newer than the remainder of his suit , which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn buttons , breeches of the same , tanned leggings , and a straw hat overlaid with black glazed canvas . At his back he carried by a looped strap a rush basket , from which protruded at one end the crutch of a hayknife , a wimble for hay-bonds being also visible in the aperture . His measured , springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while in the turn and plant of each foot there was , further , a dogged and cynical indifference personal to himself , showing its presence even in the regularly interchanging fustian folds , now in the left leg , now in the right , as he paced along . I could draw that .... I could draw the labourer ... beginning in Spitalfields , Gun Street , the pavement artist . Bell again ! " Wo n't you go away ? It 's not a damned piano key ! " Sorry about shouting . Poor Maria . She gave me her gift . All the youth she left behind , running from the beasts . Coughing , coughing . Taking deep breaths . Coughing subsides . Lovely . Picking up the book again . Heavy . Holding it up to my closed eyes . If I could do nothing but read . Would n't it ? Or paint . And paint . Nothing but that . Seascape , oceanside beach .

And if Maria . Could we make a new ? But no . These lungs of blood . Maria , run , do n't run in circles . The brute is shouting . The guns are massing . Commentators agree , in the autumn , some terrible beauty may be born again . But here , now . My wasted life . My merry-go-round of hellish love .
