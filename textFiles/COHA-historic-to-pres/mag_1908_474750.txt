CLOUDS in some one or other of their many forms are alrnogt always with us . They , and the-blue vault which forms their background , together make one-half of our environnaent . They accompany , and often precede , all those changes of weather which make a large part of our lives , and an . even larger part of our conversation . Yet the English language , the richest tongue which is spoken , has no words of popular origin by which the details of a cloudy sky can be intelligently discussed . A few popular cloud names do , indeed , exist , but they are used in so vague a manner , and there is so much uncertainty as to their meaning , that they only serve to emphasiae the lack of any real code . To many , the extraordinary variety of cloud forms , and the way in which they graduate into one another , may seem enough excuse , since it is not easy to fasten a special name upon one particular stage in a long-continued series . But cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain forms bear a relation to weather changes so obvious that very little observation is required to note them . flow is it , then , that these families and these portents of the weather to came have not long ago found places in the popular dictionary ? The fact is that singularly few people really observe the clouds . Even those who are keenly on the alert for all else that goes on around them very often take little heed of the clouds unless they happen to form the chief features of a sunset sky , or some such phenomenon , and then it is the effects of light and color which are noticed-rather than the cloud forms . Some twenty years ago , when the application of photography to cloud study was in its infancy , the writer had a large collection on view at a meeting of the British Association . On passing one day through the gallery where they were hung a group of three or four of the most distinguished physicists of the world was found standing before some pictures of wavelike forms , busily discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had no idea , " said one of them , turning to the writer , " that clouds had such definite forms until I saw these photographs of yours . " Here was a man whose whole life had been spent in accurate observation , and yet he had never seen what any one may see for the mere trouble of looking . What wonder , then , that such things should escape the notice of the great majority . Clouds fall naturally into two great classes , those whose component particles arc frozen into minute crystals of ice , and those whose particles are tiny droplets of water . Ice clouds are the highest and thinnest , and are almost always characterized by a fibrous structure , and by the fact that they cast no definite shadows . Indeed , as a general rule , they fail to hide the sun enough to make their presence greatly felt . These are those which were named by Luke Howard , little mere than a century ago , cirrus clouds . True , typical cirrus always appears as short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fan-shaped bunches , sometimes in long parallel bundles , sometimes in beautifully intricate network . Every large storm-cloud is fringed on its advancing side by long bands made up of cirrus , and many of these broad ribbons have a most complicated internal structure resembling that of an enormous feather . At other times , when the air is still , the ice clouds form into small balls of cloud which float side by side in patches . The little balls are always small , and each cloudlet is more or less semi-transparent , showing no shadow on the side away from the sun , but all parts gleaming equally bright . If such clouds are watched they are often . seen to change their shape , passing from the globular cloud-lets to a mass of fibres , as if the little snowflakes which made them had begun to fall slowly earthward . Then in a moment the whole lacewerk melts away into the blue , only to begin again . At other times the little balls of cloud make their appearance and float along with little change , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On these occasions they frequently drop down long slender filaments , which trail behind , bending into graceful , descending curves which dwindle away to nothing . These are the falling snowflakes , and they trail behind because they descend into air which is moving less rapidly . Yet , again , when the upper air is full of movement , eddies and swirls taking place in different directions , the cirrus clouds are transformed into curving lines , some downward , some upward , according to whether they are caught and drawn out by this eddy or that . Such a condition can only occur when there is a strong wind above us , and the characteristic form of cirrus , therefore , comes in windy weather , or when storms or gales may be expected . Cirrus clouds are generally detached , leaving broad spaces of blue sky , but sometimes they spread out in level sheets which ultimately cover large portions of the heavens . These sheets of cloud are then called cirro-stratus , while the granular or lumpy variety is known as cirrocumulus . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it shows little of the characteristic fibrous structure , because there is no doubt that it is made of minute ice particles . It makes its appearance at . first as a silvery gray haze through which the sun or moon shines with little loss of lustre , but the presence of the cloud is shown by a large ring of light around the luminary . A halo , as this is called , around the moon is often seen , and is well known to be an indication of a coming storm , for the great cloud canopy of a moving cyclone is fringed with this cirro-nebula , as it is called by meteorologists . The halo formed round the sun , though really very much commoner and much more beautiful , is comparatively seldom seen . The whole sky , when covered with the cirro-nebula , glows so brilHandy under full sunlight that the eye is dazzled ; but if the sun is hidden by some denser and lower cloud , or if the whole is seen by reflection from a sheet of glass blackened on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering like the colors on an iridescent shell . Every now and then some one happens to notice these beautiful tints , and in due course a paragraph appears in some newspaper about . the wonderful iridescent cloud , though the phenomenon is much commoner than a thunder-storm . Cirrus clouds are extremely beautiful , bul their very delicacy is a defect , and they must yield the palm for beauty to those which come a little lower hi the air , where moisture is more abundant , and where the water clouds begin . These are known to science as alto-cumulus when their characteristic feature is the collection of the particles into more or less rounded or detached cloudlets , or alto-stratus when the dominant feature is a level sheet or layer of cloud . Our most gorgeous sunsets and our most brilliant skies are due to the alto clouds . They resemble cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus , but their component cloud-lets are larger and denser , and there is rarely any admixture with eirriform fibres . The sun shining through them is greatly dimmed , and may even be hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more light from their sunlit surfaces , and to throw contrasting shadows on the surfaces turned away . They stand out on the background of the blue sky with a brilliancy and solidity which easily distinguish them from the thinner cirrus , and no halo or iridescent play of color is ever seen runorg them . When , however , the glowing colors of sunset are thrown upon them they shine out with a splendor which is matched by no other cloud . Floating , as they do , at a height of several miles above the ground , they catch the full light of the sun long after it has set , and it is no uncommon thing for them to stand out like flakes and balls of fire against a background of purple sky . The most splendid sunset ever seen by the writer was one evening in December , 1883 , when the gorgeous coloring of one of the famous sunsets due to the volcanic dust thrown up from Krakatoa was reflected by some wonderfully marshalled rows of alto-cumulus . This arrangement of cloudlets in rows is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even more often . In both cases it must be caused by differences in the velocity with which the air is moving at different altitudes . Any such difference must result in wavelike up and down movements , which act upon the level where the clouds are forming in such a way as to determine where they shall or shall not come into being . Waved clouds , or ripple clouds , as they may be called , have very short lives . They mark either the closing hour of a sheet of cloud which is breaking up and disappearing , or the opening phases of one which is growing . Sometimes the waves are bent or curved . At one time they may form long unbroken lines , and at another each wave is composed of a row of balls or flakes . In any case they are most beautiful , and from their rapid changes most interesting to watch . Alto clouds are most frequent , most varied , and most beautiful in still , calm , summer weather . Not , the type of blazing heat which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steel blue sky , a dim , hazy distance and ab sence of cloud , except perchance a few light wisps of lofty cirrus . But when such a spell of anti-cyelonic weather is coming to an end , or in the sultry heat which gives birth to thunder-storms , then it is that we find the alto clouds in their greatest perfection . We may watch them , if wo will , slowly forming as little spots of white , larger and evidently more opaque than their loftier representatives in the cirrus zone . Sometimes they form rounded balls of cloud , and , if so , they signify only that the weather conditions are rather unstable . At other times the little balls begin to lengthen upward , so that they float like pillows upon end . This is a well known warning that the state of the air is just that which breeds the thunder-cloud . Indeed , alto-cumulus of this type is probably unknown except in the neighborhood of violent electrical disturbances , and , if it is seen , the anvil top of a thunder-cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon . Turreted cloud it has been called in reference to the Way in which its cloud-lets lift up their heads . They commonly stand in companies , but are sometimes broadly and evenly distributed over wide areas of sky , drifting slowly at a height of four or five miles above our heads . They are clouds of the afternoon , rarely forming until the day is well advanced , and seldom lasting into twilight . Late in the afternoon , and persistent long after the sun has disappeared , another form of alto cloud is seen in which the detached cloudlets have the form of pillows lying flat . Indeed , the idea they convey is rather that of a flat sheet broken into innumerable pieces , so the whole is called spotted alto-stratus , or in popular language mackerel sky , when that term is properly used . The common saying that mackerel sky is a sign of rain is not altogether mistaken . Alto-stratus of this kind is always a sign of unsettled conditions , but it is more frequent when wet weather is improving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The alto cloud which is en almost sure symptom of had weather is the level sheet of alto-stratus through which the sun or moon shows as a bright blur without any colored fringes or distant halo . If it grows denser and darker , shutting out more and more light. , the wise and observant will make ready , for however fine the weather may have been , a change is almost certainly at hand . Far below the level of the alto clouds come those which seem to con-cern us more imme-diately . We do not always realize that the changing fea-tures of the shining cirrus , or the more brilliant formations of the alto clouds , are full of mean-ing , or how much may he learned from them by not-ing their forms in connection with the behavior of the ba-rometer . But all can appreciate the nim5us , or rain-cloud , with its dull gray ragged masses of vapor ; and we must be preoccu-pied indeed not to see its approach and know its meaning . The stratus also , or level sheet of cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray skies of winter , and seems to serve no useful purpose except to draw a blanket over us at night and save us from too keen a touch of frost . Stratus is also a very familiar feature of the evening sky . The uprising currents which are the consequence of the heat of day begin to slacken toward sunset , and when the twilight is upon us they generally cease altogether . While they last , the water particles which form the clouds are buoyed up like corks upon a fountain , but when they end , the little droplets fall earthward into warmer air . The layer in which this takes place is soon saturated with moisture , and then more droplets convert it into a slowly sinking sheet of cloud which gets lower and lower , and more and more broken , until it disappears altogether . As for the cumulus , the towering white masses of gleaming vapor which rear their vast pyramids against the sky , who has not watched them as they move in silent state from one horizon to the other ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching their best development in sunny weather when the ground is moist and warm . Each one , indeed , is but the visible summit of a tall column of rising air which floats upwards from the ground , carrying its water vapor with it . As the damp air rises higher it expands more and more and becomes cooler in consequence , until at length , at some particular level , it is cooled so much that some of its watery burden is condensed . This is the base of the cloud , and as the air rises , more and more of the mist appears , until the mass of air is so cool and so laden with water particles that ascent is stopped . The clear - cut outline of the upper part of a cumulus seems still enough to the careless eye , hut , if it he steadily watched , it will be seen to he in continual movement , some of its domes rising , others sinking or moving sideways , and the stately stillness is seen to he really incessant change , huge columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the ground and the stiller the air the greater do these uprising columns become , and the clouds grow in volume until they can be measured by the cubic mile ; and then they pass into the cumulo-nimbus or shower cloud , of which the awe-inspiring thundercloud is the ultimate development . Thunder-clouds , or those from which a smart shower is falling , can always be distinguished from the harmless cumulus by the contour of the upper part . On a hot day , if the top of a distant thundercloud is watched , it may be seen to be rising rapidly above its fellows , or some one of its domes may be rising above the rest . Step by step it rises , at first ending in a rounded curve . But the top soolt seems to flatten , not by a descent of the crown , but by a more rapid up-rush of its sides , and then the summit spreads out rapidly in a horizontal plane , while the central column thickens until the outline of the whole is like that of a gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well may our forefathers have thought that the thunder was the sound of Thor 's hammer strokes , for this anvil form is the distinguishing feature of the fully formed thundercloud . It is hidden in the larger examples , and passes into the greater thunder ? clouds which consist of a disk of cumulus whose summits rise higher and higliex toward the centre . Here is ? a vast colui4ni : sometimes several miles --  in ? diameter , of uprushirig vapor , which expands shove into an upper disk of cirri-form cloud , often spreading for many miles ahead of the central storm . The dimensions of these thunder-clouds are sometimes very . great . One which was roughly measured by the writer must have contained at least one hundred and fifty cubic miles of cloud ; and it was by no means an unusually large specimen of its kind . Steadily these great clouds pass onward , but just as the growth of a summer cumulus creates forces which limit its size , so the heavy rain and frozen hail which are the consequence of the great size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ultimately they conic to an end , and the anvil top sinks down into a flat-topped cloud destined to break up and disappear , unless perchance some other portion of the great lower disk should boil up in a similar way and repeat the whole cycle . This is what happens when a thunder-storm divides into two , and to some extent it is the reason why such storms seem to roll to and fro . Thunder-clouds are rarely single . They form in companies , and since they are due to specially violent upward currents they come chiefly in hot weather , and though they often make very violent squalls of wind they rarely come into being in windy weather . The very conditions which give rise to them . are also those which bring the most beautiful and most varied examples of the higher cloud , for the same expansion of the lower air to which they are due produces upward heavings of the upper air , and so brings about the production of- alto-cumulus and cirro=cumulus . Growth , change , and decay form a trio which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes , each its meaning , each comes in its proper place . The student of the clouds can follow all their forms through the three stages , and can learn by experience how to foretell what is to come from what he sees occur . The thunder-cloud gives us the grandest and most rapid history , and has . a human interest of danger and destructiveness which makes it appeal to all . But all clouds have their histories also . Their modifications are no less interesting and no less marked , but their meaning and - their movement can only be fully appreciated by those who care to look above them and study carefully the mysterious and beautiful features of the great aerial ocean upon whose floor we live .
