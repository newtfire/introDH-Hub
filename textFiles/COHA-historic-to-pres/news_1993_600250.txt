James Michener . Jackie Collins . Luigi Sartor . <p> Luigi Sartor ? <p> Sure , you know , the author of that sizzling read , Slot Coating : Fluid Mechanics and Die Design . <p> Never heard of it ? It 's a hit ; academia 's Gone With the Wind . Well , sort of . <p> Every year , 10 doctoral dissertations are crowned " top sellers " by University Microfilms International - which means Slot and its brethren on the current list have sold about 30 copies each , mostly to school libraries . <p> As the academic year winds down , frazzled grad students nationwide will add about 40,000 titles to the files of UMI . The Ann Arbor , Mich. - based clearinghouse stocks more than a million " labors of love , " says the firm 's William Savage , who notes that the doctoral ranks have grown in recent years in response to a tightening job market . <p> While most tomes will retire to that giant microfilm spool in the sky , a chosen few will be in demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , the good , the bizarre and the famous . Among the wacky are Electrical Measurements on Cuticles of the American Cockroach and Determinants of Flossing Behavior in the College Age Population . Honest . <p> Then there 's love-meister Leo Buscaglia 's 1962 dissertation on adolescent stutterers , and Rambo creator David Morell 's demure 1970 thesis , John Barth : An Introduction . <p> And if you 've ever watched the credits to The Cosby Show , you know William H. has a doctorate : His 1977 paper explored using ' toon star Fat Albert as a teaching aid . <p> If you 're not familiar with a doctoral dissertation , the massive opus is the culminating keystone requirement for a Ph.D . ( doctor of philosophy ) , a signal to the bellman in the Ivory Tower of Higher Learning to send down the elevator . <p> It can also mean more money : High school graduates average a monthly salary of $ 1,077 , while Ph.D. - owners pull in $ 3,855 , according to a survey by the Council of Graduate Schools , Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tears : Authors often say it 's sheer torture . <p> " The average time spent on ( a Ph.D. ) is seven years , " says the council 's Peter Syverson . " The purpose of a dissertation is to prove that you can do original research . " <p> Original research . <p> Never have two words wreaked so much mental mayhem . The quest to produce something new - 37,451 doctorates were granted last year - often leads scholars to pitch themselves into the chasm of the obscure . <p> On UMI 's hit list for 1992 is Conrad Graf : Imperial Royal Court Fortepiano Maker in Vienna . It may sound like a Saturday Night Live skit , but author Deborah Wythe spent three years hunting old pianos . At 677 pages , it 's short . John Thomas Kartesz 's A Flora of Nevada - best seller in 1990 and 1992 - takes up 1,739 pages . <p> The truth is each dissertation puts a subject under the cerebral equivalent of an electron microscope . <p> And in a world where TV fare can distract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce A Classification of Drinking Styles Using the Topographical Components of Beer Drinking requires laudable concentration indeed . <p> So why do they do it ? We checked in with three of 1992 's hot-selling doctoral brain trusts : <p> Never mind Steinway . Deborah Wythe has played the piano for years ; after dissecting Herr Conrad Graf , she could probably build one . <p> " I always liked instruments , especially taking them apart , " which she did for her 1990 Ph.D . from New York University . <p> Wythe , who now works at the Brooklyn Museum as an archivist , spent three years traveling Europe in search of Graf 's 3,000-odd 19th-century pianos . She found about 70 , many in playing condition . <p> " In his day , Graf was right in there , " Wythe says . " Chopin came to his shop one day . ( From letters ) it seems like it was a pretty big deal . He liked the pianos . Everybody did . <p> " His pianos are beautiful . . . . But he was not messing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came before him . " <p> Wythe 's work - popular given today 's renaissance of music performed on period instruments - started in 1980 and stopped in 1984 . <p> " My research was done , " she says . " But I ran out of grant funds , got a full-time job and would pick it up and put it down . In 1989 , I said , ' I have to finish it or forget it . ' " <p> Just a label ? Think again . As a title , Slot Coating ( University of Minnesota , 1990 ) could cure insomnia . <p> But as Sartor explains his work , the fog lifts to reveal a thesis with real-world relevance . <p> " I wrote about the process of applying a thin film of liquid ( adhesive ) over a traveling substance ( paper ) , " says Sartor , who works for label-making giant Avery Dennison in Pasadena , Calif . <p> Sartor attributes his best-selling status to a dearth of theoretical research on the science , heavily employed in both the label-making and photographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a memory , and Sartor now indulges his passion for rock climbing . Social gatherings , however , can be tough . <p> " People will say they 're interested . . . then I 'll see I 'm not making a connection . That 's when I tell them to think about diaper tape . They think it 's trivial , and I tell them it 's millions of dollars in research . " <p> Green thumb deluxe . John Thomas Kartesz thinks big . Huge . <p> " At first , I wanted to describe and map all the plants in North America . " He settled for Nevada . <p> Over seven years , Kartesz logged more than 70,000 miles in his old Honda , nabbing 4,000 plants for A Flora of Nevada ( University of Nevada , 1988 ) . <p> " Nevada is particularly rich in rare and endangered species , " he says . " So cataloging all of them was important in terms of ( both ) conservation efforts " as well as federal land management policy decisions . Currently a director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kartesz says his interest in the green stuff stems in part from a feeling that " animals have always been popular , but plants have been ignored and trivialized . " <p> The search for any plant " that was unique " in Nevada produced the news that there were a larger number of species than previously was believed , as well as a mountain of data and maps that sent the student to the dean . <p> " I had to ask for special permission to type ( it ) single-space . " <p> Why not simply hand in 3,400 pages double-spaced ? <p> " Are you kidding ? " Kartesz quips . " As a poor grad student I barely had money to pay for the paper , let alone binding something that thick . " <p> Perhaps the best coda to these doctoral blues is found in this dissertation dedication from UMI 's voluminous files of the odd and amusing : <p> " I would like to acknowledge the many years of tolerance exhibited by my parents who will be the happiest of all , for they now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in school .
