Had they been interviewed , some people who figured in last week 's news might have related certain of their doings as follows : <P> President von Hindenburg of Germany : " Berlin coiffeurs are attempting to launch the ' Hindenburg bob , ' an exaggerated ' shingle , ' imitative of my short bristling pompadour . I made known unofficially last week my disapproval of this new ' bob . ' Docile German modistes at once clapped wigs upon such of their mannequins as had adopted it . " <P> Alfonso , Prince of the Austurias , eldest son of King Alfonso XIII of Spain : " The motor car in which I was riding with my tutor near San Sebastian last week collided with a motor truck and I escaped injury as by a miracle . My health has been reported ' indifferent ' for so long that I am suspected of suffering from some permanent disorder and there is talk of offering the succession to someone else . If I am passed over it is expected that a similar fate will overtake my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone deaf . In that case our father 's third son , Prince Juan , would probably be designated heir apparent . " <P> Maria Guglielmi , sister of the late Rudolph Valentino : " My brother left an estate of more than $1,000,000 which will be divided equally between myself , my other brother , Alberto , who is now in Hollywood , and the aunt of Winifred Shaughnessy Hudnut , Mrs. Teresa Werner , who took such motherly care of Rudolph after Winifred had divorced him last year . Winifred ( also known professionally as Natacha Rambova ) was bequeathed the sum of $1 . The bulk of Rudolph 's estate will come from his earnings in his last two films , The Eagle and The Son of the Sheik . However , there are other things : his two homes , three Isotta Frachini cars , three other automobiles , the yacht Phoenix , duelling pistols and medieval arms , 40 suits , 50 pairs of shoes , 300 neckties , 1,000 pairs of socks . " <P> Roger W. Babson , statistician : " To impress upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my guests at Wellesley Hills , Mass. , the dangers of overextending the instalment business , I said , that ' a distinct recession in business and possibly a panic within two or three years would not be surprising . ' " <P> Harry Mulford Jewett , president Paige-Detroit Motor Car Co. : " I made a speech to 1,500 of my Jewett and Paige dealers at an elaborate dinner in the grand ballroom of the Book Cadillac Hotel , Detroit . Said I : ' The new Paige is a powerful brute . You can drive it right through hell and you ca n't make it heat up . ' "
