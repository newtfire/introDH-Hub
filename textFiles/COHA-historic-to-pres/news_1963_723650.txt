Indianapolis , Dec. 9 tU ? A grand jury today indicted State Fire Marshal Ira Anderson , In ; dianapolis Fire Chief Arnold W. Phillips , and five other men in the Indiana state fairgrounds Coliseum explosion which killed 72 persons at a Halloween ice show . Anderson was charged with failure to inspect the huge building before issuing a permit , and with failure to inspect during the last year and remove liquid petroleum tanks believed responsible for the blast and resuiting tragedy . Phillips was charged with failure to inspect during the I ast six-month period as required by law . Disregard by Many " This grand jury , " a 21-page special report on the Oct. 31 tragedy said , " can think of ix possible excuse or justification which would allow this terrible disaster to occur . It was caused by the utter disregard of duty by Many . . . . " The other five persons indicted were charged with involuntary manslaughter . They are : Melvin T. Ross , manager of the Indianapolis Coliseum corporation which leased the building for entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building . Edward Ensign , Edward Franger , and Fred Helms , three officials of Discount Gas corporation , which supplied the suspect gas tanks to the Coliseum . Released Under Bonds All the indicted persons surrendered voluntarily and were released on bonds ranging from $1,000 to $3,500 . " I 'm quite surprised , " said Phillips . " We 're not quite sure what this is all about . " The blast was blamed by the jurors , in line with preliminary findings of experts , on propane gas being used in tanks located in the Coliseum in violation of a state law requiring such tanks to he used outdoors only . The implication of the jury 's report as well as the findings of investigators in a long probe of the disaster was that if the tanks had not been in the building , the blast could not have happened . Consequence of Heat The blast was blamed on a series of incidents involving heat from another source , a possible overfilled tank , a safety valve , and high-pressure gas spewing from the tank and howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report said , " that the performers or the ice show itself had any connection with the circumstances which may have caused the explosion . " This was entirely in the hands of local and state interests whose responsibility it was to safeguard against possible injury . " We believe no single person , standing alone , would have been so foolish as to set up five 100-pound cylinders of highly volatile and extremely sensitive propane beneath the seats of the many patrons who would necessarily sit above the peril without ever having a chance of knowing what extreme hazard had been placed beneath them , and thus when such a thing is done by several persons it becomes even more incomprehensible and inconceivable . " The grand jury said that " in view of the fact that the Coliseum building is on state property , is owned by and in the name of the state . . that a primary obligation to inspect and examine the building , often and thoroly , rested upon the state of Indiana . " It is said there was " no one seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety and welfare of the some three million people who have entered the building during the past 10 years . " Fair Board Knew It " The fair board knew these heaters were being used inside the Coliseum building . It was no secret . . . " There was only one way those people could have been saved and that was never to have taken the cylinders into the building in the first place , as the fire marshal 's regulations require . " The inescapable conclusion from this investigation is that the fire marshal , Ira J. Anderson , has not carried out the mandatory provisions of the law which outlines his duties . Had he done so , for example , by actually inspecting the Coliseum building carefully in the light of his own regulations , he would have long ago alerted the patrons and the management to the violations involved in the use of liquid petroleum gas . But this he did not do . " The report said the law requires the chief of the city fire department to " make inspections of buildings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
