Suggestions That Another Loop and a New Terminal Be Arranged . In regard to the relief of Brooklyn people , let me offer this suggestion : Three years have gone by since the opening of the Williamsburg Bridge . No move has been made to run the Brooklyn elevated trains on the rails which have been spiked there to the cross ties all this time , and still the great disgrace goes on daily at the old bridge . A very simple way to give the needed relief would be to construct an elevated road or subway in connection with the Williamsburg Bridge west through Delancey Street and Spring Street , in Hudson Street , and back to the bridge through Broome Street . A one-track loop over this route can be built quickly and cheaply . This would practically be an extension of the B. R. T. system across Manhattan Island , and connecting with all the existing or projected north and south lines . This route would be in a straight line -- a great need simply filed . Why should the Interborough or any other New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooklyn .
