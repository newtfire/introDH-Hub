STATE 'S ATTORNEY Bernard Carey will ask the Cook County Grand Jury to indict Aid . Thomas E. Keane 31st on conflict of interest charges , sources in Carey 's office said yesterday . Carey will seek the indictment of the City Council 's most powerful alderman on Friday or Monday , it was revealed . The Tribune learned that the grand jury needs to obtain only one minor document to complete the evidence against Keane in one allegedly illegal aspect of his wide financial dealings . When that document has been presented to the jurors , the jurors will be asked to vote whether or not to indict the alderman , sources said . Tile GRAND jury has set its sights on Keane 's ownership of stock in the Jefferson State Bank while at the same time he voted as an alderman to place city funds in the same bank , it was learned . The state conflict of interest law prohibits a public official from acting or voting on a contract for an enterprise in which he has a financial interest . Keane acquired 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Av. in May , 1965 , only a few days after he engineered the city 's sale of a downtown alley to Bernard Feinberg , president of the bank . The vacated alley between Jackson Boulevard and Quincy Street was sold to Feinberg for only 519,920 . A subsequent cityordered assessment showed the alley to be worth more than $68,000 . THE ALLEY was part of a block of prime Loop property that Feinberg was putting to-. gether . Since acquiring the stock in the Jefferson State Bank , Keane has voted every . year except the present one in favor of depositing pity funds in the bank . The grand jury also is investigating Ald. Edwin P. Fifielski 45th who reportedly owns more than 1,000 shares of stock in the Jefferson State Bank . ANOTHER AREA of Keane 's finances which the grand jury is investigating for possible future legal action concerns his attempt last December to push thru the City Council a contract with the Airport Parking Corporation of America to operate the huge new O'Hare parking garage . Keane recommended to the council that the contract be awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part-owner of three Near North Side parking lots which were leased to A. P. C. 0 . A. After the Better Government Association accused Ald. Keane of conflict of interest in this matter , Mayor Daley spiked the proposed contract with A. P. C. 0 . A. and opened the parking contract to competitive bidding . THE THIRD aspect of Keane 's dealings which the county grand jury is probing at length concerns Keane 's dual role as Mayor Daley 's floor leader in the City Council and a member of secret land trusts which allegedly profited from city ordinances which Keane sponsored . The B. G. A. charged earlier this month that Keane and his associates in the secret trusts purchased nearly 400 parcels of city property for back property taxes at prices ranging from $1 to $100 per parcel at county auctions over 10 years . Most of the properties were also burdened with unpaid special assessments levied by the city for local improvements over the years . Keane , on his own motion as Finance Committee chairman and council floor leader , obtained settlement of the city claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usual 50 per cent settlement , the B. G. A. said .
