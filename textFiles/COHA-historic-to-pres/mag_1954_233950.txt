" Why do they still call me a dictator ? " President Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza mused one day last week , as he chatted with a visitor on the plank porch of his Tamarindo ranch house . " Our jails are empty of political prisoners . Our press is as free as a bird . The newspapers attack me all the time . I let them . They can call me anything but an s.o.b . " The President laughed : " I wo n't stand for that . " <P> Tacho Somoza was in a mellow mood . He was not really complaining-just thinking out loud and airing a few mild gripes . One of them was about the U.S. Unswerving in his love for the U.S. ( he worked and studied in Philadelphia from 1912 to 1919 ) , he could not understand why his affection was not more warmly reciprocated . " The U.S. takes its best friends for granted , " he said . " You wo n't even give us arms , and yet you pour billions into European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we get from being friendly ? You treat us like an old wife . We would rather be treated like a young mistress . " <P> Good for Tacho . Aside from that , Tacho clearly felt that almost everything was right with the world , and especially the 57,145 sq . mi. of it that is Nicaragua . Everyone there knows that what is good for Tacho is good for the country , and things at the moment are very good for Tacho . Since the U.S. Marines moved out and he took over , almost 20 years ago , he has created considerable wealth in his little ( pop . 1,088,000 ) republic . Some of it has rubbed off on Nicaragua and deserving Nicaraguans . But plenty of it ( reportedly as much as $60 million worth ) has stuck to Tacho like chewing gum to the sole of a shoe . <P> A shrewd real-estate buyer , Tacho owns almost 10% of his country 's arable land . Because his holdings are widely scattered , Nicaragua now has more than 600 miles of all-weather public roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along a 40-mile stretch of the new road from Managua to Tamarindo , there is not a single town , village or house-but the road ends at a valuable salt flat where Tacho plans to process enough salt for the whole country . His diversified interests have helped transform Nicaragua from a one-crop ( coffee ) country into an exporter of rice , sesame , cotton , sugar , corn , cattle and lumber . His operations in cotton raising and ginning , sugar-milling , icemaking , distilling , textiles , lumber and cattle provide work for more than 20,000 Nicaraguans . To get his produce to world markets , he has organized a private merchant marine , the Mamenic Line . <P> Better for Tacho . Tacho has no real opposition to worry about . In 1950 , he made a deal giving the Conservatives a third of the congressional seats and a quota of the Supreme Court and diplomatic missions . That has kept them quiet . Now 57 , Tacho tells friends that he would like to take things easier , and he may be quite sincere about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip without inviting an unseemly struggle for power , throwing innumerable relatives out of work and deflating the value of many of his properties . Most observers have concluded that he would try to keep the presidency in the family , turning it over to one of his two sons , Luis , now president of Congress , or Anastasio Jr. , chief of staff of the Guardia National .
