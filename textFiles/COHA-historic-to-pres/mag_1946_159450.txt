December lived up to its Swazi name : " the time to pick teeth for a harvest . " The veld lay parched in the midsummer sun . Hillsides and grasslands rotted rustily . Scorching winds raised dust from the river beds . By January even the mighty Orange had shrunk to a feeble trickle . A throttling drought gripped South Africa . <P> Almost a hundred districts had been officially declared stricken . The staple summer crop , corn , had failed and the country faced famine . At best the harvest could be no bigger than half the 22 million bags needed . <P> In the kraals the Negroes grew lean and hungry . Their cattle grew lean and died . The cattle price for wives ( lobola ) dropped steadily ' as the herds diminished . Many Negroes walked hundreds of miles to the towns for food , but there , too , the white folks were standing all night outside food stores . <P> Now , if ever , was the time for the rain makers . In the kraals the witch doctors prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Jan Christiaan Smuts proclaimed a national day of prayer for rain . On the advice of their witch doctors , Basutos climbed their peaks with calabashes of Kaffir beer to propitiate their ancestors . But no rain came . <P> In the neighboring Drakensberg thousands of Bantu , against the advice of their doctors , climbed 12,000 feet to beseech the Christian God for rain . It rained-a little . Then , on Smuts 's day of prayer the white folk prayed in their churches . Almost at once , the rains came . They have been coming ever since .
