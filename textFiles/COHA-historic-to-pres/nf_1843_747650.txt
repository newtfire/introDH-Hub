liberties and immunities of free and natural born subjects within the realm of England . " But the common law thus brought by the colonists was , it must be observed , very different at the periods of the different settlements . The common law as existing at the settlement of Virginia was very much modified before the settlement cf Georgia in the reign of George the second ; so that there never has been in the various states the same system of common law in all its ramifications , though its general character throughout the whole was very much the same , except so far as it had been altered by statutes enacted by the legislatures of the respective colonies . For very early after the respective settlements , provincial assemblies were established , composed of the representatives of the freeholders and planters , with whom were associated the governor and council , the last of whom composed an upper house , while the governor was invested with the power of a negative , and of proroguing and dissolving them . Thus constituted they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large and important variations from the common law in all its branches ; so that at the date of the revolution , and still more at the date of the present constitution of the United States , the systems of jurisprudence of the several states were so dissimilar that it would have been impossible , even if had been desired , to have adopted the common law as the general law of the United States as such . The power of legislation thus exercised by the colonial legislatures , with the restrictions necessarily arising from ( c ) See Cond . Rep. 204 , 211 , 212 ; 10 East . 282 , 283 , 289. /z/ their dependence on Great Britain was not without control : for in all the colonies , except Maryland , Connecticut and Rhode Island , the king possessed the power of abrogating the laws , and they were not final in their authority until they had passed under his review . ( 1 Story 158 . ) The colonies indeed were looked upon as dependencies of the British crown and owing allegiance thereto ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Vez. 444 ; Vaugh . R. 300 , 400 ; Shower 's Pari . Ca. 30 , &c.); From him the colonial assemblies were considered as deriving their energies , and it was in his power to assent or dissent to all their proceedings . In regard to the authority of parliament , the government of Great Britain maintained the right of that body to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever ; though it was admitted that they were bound by no act of parliament in which they were not expressly named . In America different opinions were entertained on the subject at different times and in different colonies . The power of taxation however was resisted from a very early period ; ( 1 Story 172 , 3 , 4 , ) and the allegiance to the crown on the one hand , and the right of exemption from taxes unless imposed by themselves on the other , are equally asserted in a declaration of the colonies assembled at New York in October 1765. ( 1 Story 175 . ) And although in the same paper , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted , yet upon the same principles on which the right of taxation was denied , the people of the colonies at length settled down upon the broad principle , that parliament had no power to bind them by its laws , except by such as might be enacted for the regulation of commerce and of the general concerns of the empire . While allegiance to the crown was thus admitted , the authority of parliament to legislate in matters of taxation and internal policy was denied ; and even the declaration of independence distinctly evinces by its silence as to parliament , that the authority to which they traced their wrongs , and whose action upon them was recognized was the king alone , until the power of taxation was asserted by parliament . This assertion and the wrongs of the crown at length brought revolution , and as soon as its first steps were taken , and even before a final separation was in contemplation , a close union and co-operation of all the co- /z/ lonies were perceived to be essential to the successful vindication of their rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the several colonies accordingly assembled first in 1774 , and afterwards in 1775 , and by them the necessary measures were adopted for the general defence . We shall hereafter have occasion to consider whether this body was to be looked upon as representing one people or thirteen distinct communities . But in this hasty sketch of the progress of the states to their present condition , it seems only necessary to say , that the congress of 1774 considered itself as invested with power to concert measures for redress of grievances , and that those of 1775 and 1776 were clothed with yet more ample powers ; their commissions being sufficiently broad to embrace the right to pass measures of a national character and obligation . Anticipating the eager spirit of the people in resistance of British oppression and claims of dominion , they took measures of national defence ; prohibited intercourse and trade with Great Britain , and raised an army and navy and authorized hostilities . They also raised and borrowed money ; emitted bills of credit ; established a post office , and authorized captures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appellate jurisdiction to themselves . At length , by the same body , the United States were declared independent in the most gloomy moments of the contest , and they continued to exercise the powers of a general government under a loose and irregular authority , until the adoption of the articles of confederation by some of the states in 177S . Those articles gave indeed a more firm and decided character to the government , and sustained by patriotism and the ardour of the conflict , bore us at length safely through our arduous struggle with one of the most powerful nations of the globe . On the termination of the war , the pressure of which , like the pressure of the superincumbent atmosphere , gave a principle of solidity to our institutions which did not properly belong to them , every thing became relaxed . The bands which united us seemed loosened , and all perceived how important it was they should be tightened . Years however passed away before the submission of the plan of a new constitution to the people , and the adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation than it /z/ placed the states of the Union upon an elevation which even the most sanguine could scarcely have anticipated . We may reiterate the exclamation which Mr. Blackstone has borrowed from father Paul , and terminate our grateful acknowledgments to the giver of all good for our blessed constitution , by the fervent ejaculation " Esto perpetual After this rapid sketch let us now proceed to look more closely into the nature and character , not only of our institutions , but of the relation which the several states have borne to each other , whether considered as colonies , or as brethren fighting shoulder to shoulder under the same irregular government , or as members of a great and organized confederacy , or finally as constituting the great and happy Union under which we live , protected against enemies abroad , and carefully secured from the danger of tyranny at home . In the history of the two great parties which have divided the people of the United States ever since the adoption of the present constitution , a constant struggle is observable in relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called by a strange perversion ( d ) Judge Story tells us : 286 . In this state of things the embarrassments of the country in its financial concerns , the general pecuniary distress among the people from the exhausting operations of the war , the total prostration of commerce , and the languishing unthriftiness of agriculture , gave new impulses to the already marked political divisions in the legislative councils . Efforts were made , on one side , to relieve the pressure of the public calamities by a resort to the issue of paper money , to tender laws , and instalment and other laws , having for their object the postponement of the payment of private debts , and a diminution of the public taxes . On the other side , public as well as private creditors became alarmed from the increased dangers to property , and the increased facility of perpetrating frauds to the destruction of all private faith and credit . And they insisted strenuously upon the establishment of a government , and system of laws , which should preserve the public faith , and redeem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violation of the principles of justice , and the moral obligation of contracts . " At length , " we are told , * " two great parties were formed in every state , which were distinctly marked , and which pursued distinct objects with systematic arrangement . The one struggled with unabated zeal for the exact observance of public and private engagements . The distresses /z/ of the use of the terms ) have always been inclined to represent the United States as constituting one people , instead of a confederacy of states ; while their opponents ( formerly called anti-federalists , but more recently known as the democratic or republican party ) have ever strenuously contended that the constitution was a compact , or the result of a compact between the states ; who retain their sovereignty , and all the rights of sovereignty , which they have not expressly transferred to the federal government . Thus we find Mr. Webster , the great champion of the federal party , pronouncing , ( and judge Story once , but no longer , supposed to be of the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine that the states are parties to the constitution is refuted by the constitution itself in its very front . It declares that it is ordained and established by the people of the United States . So far from saying that it is established by the governments of the several states , it does not even say that it is established by the people of the several states . But it pronounces that it is established by the people of the United States in the aggregate ! ! Doubtless the people of the several states taken collectively constitute the people of the United of individuals were , they thought , to be alleviated by industry and frugality , and not by a relaxation of the laws , or by a sacrifice of the rights of others . They were consequently uniform friends of a regular administration of justice , and of a vigorous course of taxation , which would enable the state to comply with its engagements . By a natural association of ideas , they were also , with very few exceptions , in favour of enlarging the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the dignity and character of the nation abroad , and its interests at home . The other party marked out for itself a more indulgent course . They were uniformly in favour of relaxing the administration of justice , of affording facilities for the payment of debts , or of suspending their collection , and of remitting taxes . The same course of opinion led them to resist every attempt to transfer from their own hands into those of congress , powers , which were by others deemed essential to the preservation of the Union . In many of the states the party last mentioned constituted a decided majority of the people ; and in all of them it was very powerful . " Such is the language of one of our best historians in treating of the period immediately preceding the formation of the constitution of the United States . " /z/ States . But it is in this their collective capacity , it is , as all the people of the United States that they establish the constitution . " ( Webster 's Speeches , pa. 430 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are delivered in Martin v. Hunter , 1 Wheat . 324 . The foregoing passage is cited here , not for the purpose of exposing its disingenuous sophisms , but merely to present the views of one of the great parties of the country in relation to our federal constitution . It is their favourite position " that the constitution of the United States was ordained and adopted , not by the states in their sovereign capacities , but emphatically , as the preamble declares by the people of the United States , and it is this position which it behoves every lover of truth and of the rights of the states most vigorously to assail . Its advocates indeed have maintained it with equal earnestness and ability , but having been foiled on some eminent occasions , and having fallen from power in no small degree from their strenuous maintenance of this political heresy , one of the most distinguished among them has compiled a laborious work with a view to sustain it . In doing this , judge Story has attempted to fortify himself , by shewing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the colonies themselves , when subjects of Great Britain , were not distinct and separate from each other , but were one people : that during the revolutionary struggle they were still one people even anterior to the confederation : that the declaration of independence treated them as one people , and that this oneness or unity particularly distinguished them in " ordaining and establishing the constitution of the United States . " Such is the general tenor , as it appears to me , of judge Story 's doctrine , but as I shall , in proceeding to examine it , quote his very language , I shall have done him no injustice , if what I have just said does not represent him fairly . Let us proceed then to state and examine his several positions . We will begin with the colonies . In page 164 , judge Story remarks that " though the colonies were independent of each other in respect to their domestic concerns , they were not wholly alien to each other . On the contrary they were fellow subjects , and for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabit if he pleased /z/ in any other , ( e ) and , as a British subject , was capable of inheriting lands by descent in every other colony . " And he proceeds to cite Ch . Jus . Jay to the same point " that they were in a variety of respects one people . " Let us then enquire whether the colonies before the revolution were justly to be regarded in any respect or for any purpose one people . I propose to examine this question shortly , according to the views of the statesmen of the times , and the admissions of judge Story himself ; according to the nature of the several political societies ; according to historical facts , and upon principle . ' First , it is clear , that the colonies were looked upon not as constituting part even of the body politic of the British government , but as subject to it ; " not as part of the mother country , but as distinct , though dependent dominions . " Such is the language of Mr. Blackstone when speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So even the kingdom of Scotland , after the union of the two crowns on the accession of James I. continued an entire , separate and distinct kingdom for above a century ; and so when judge Blackstone wrote , Ireland was still a distinct , though a dependent and subordinate kingdom ( p. 99 ) . So also of Hanover , though it has the same king that sits on the British throne , it is a distinct , independent and unconnected kingdom , ( p. 110. ) ( / ) Admitting then that the colonies , though the subjects of the crown , made no part of the mother country , but were distinct , though dependent dominions , they were a fortiori distinct from each other : For if their being subject to the authority of the crown of England did not make them to any intent one people with England , still less could they be one people with other states , that neither were subject to them nor had authority over them . ( c ) " It never was considered , " says judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of confederation a citizen of one state was to any one purpose a citizen of another . He was , as to all substantial purposes , as a foreigner to their forensic jurisprudence . If rigorous law had been enforced , perhaps , he might have been deemed an alien without an express provision of the state to save him . " Hence the provisions in the articles of confederation and in the constitution United States . ( / ) See Vattel , Burlamaque and Hutchinson , quoted Tucker 's Black , app. 64 , 65. /z/ That the colonies were held to be only subjects , and not as forming part of the British body politic , is fairly to be inferred from the speeches of lord Chatham and Mr. Burke in the passages quoted by Mr. Story himself ( p. 153 , 4 ) ; for they are distinctly considered as the subjects of the crown , and their rights and privileges are placed upon the footing of being British subjects , who , though residing in a distinct dominion from England , were entitled to the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves they considered distinct from the realm of England : and , moreover , " the authority over them was declared by lord Chatham to be sovereign and supreme in every circumstance of government and legislation . " ( g - ) The statute 6 Geo . III . also declares the colonies subordinate to and dependent upon the imperial crown and parliament : and so they were not on a footing with British people , but were subject to them , and were not therefore one with them . And if not one with them , in what manner could they be one with each other . Judge Story indeed himself admits that " for all purposes of domestic and internal regulation the colonial legislatures deemed themselves possessed of entire authority exclusive of each other , " ( p. 152 ) : and that with the restrictions necessarily arising from their dependency on Great Britain , " they were sovereign within the limits of their respective territories . " ( p. 158 . ) And again he says , " they considered themselves not as parcel of the realm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and owing allegiance thereto , the king being their supreme and sovereign lord . " If then they were not one with the realm , it is difficult indeed to imagine how they could as distinct dependencies be one with each other . Again , in page 163 , he says more distinctly , " though the colonies had a common origin , and owed a common allegiance , and the inhabitants of each were British subjects , they had no direct political connexion with each other . Each was independent of all the others ; each in a limited sense was sovereign within its own territory . There was neither alliance nor confederacy between them . ( - ) This doctrine , however extravagant , shews that Chatham did not look upon the colonies as parts of the realm . /z/ The assembly of one province could not make laws for another , nor confer privileges which were to be enjoyed or exercised in another , farther than they could be in any independent foreign state . They were known only as dependencies . " Now all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is not for me indeed to attempt to reconcile it with the position already cited , that they were to many purposes one people ; ( page 104 , ) and still less with the reasoning attempted , in page 196 , to be founded on these narrow premises . We shall have occasion however to view this matter more closely by and by . At present we think judge Story 's admissions sufficiently establish , that if the colonies were " not sovereign communities in the most large and general sense , " it was because they were subjects of the British crown , and not because they were subjects of or connected with each other . The matter would have been more doubtful had they formed parts of the realm as York and Middlesex do ; subject to the same laws , constituting portions of one body politic , and having the commune vinculum of the same legislative authority . Then indeed there might have been some pretext for considering the fragments broken off from a common mass as being homogeneous and identical , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story to establish a unity between peoples(/i) with different laws , different systems of government , different organizations in all their parts , different revenues , different taxation , different deliberative assemblies in relation to their concerns as " people , " and different local executives and judiciaries for the conduct of their affairs and the administration of their varied jurisprudence . This leads me to observe , Secondly , That the states were not one but distinct from the nature of their several political societies . This is apparent , if we look at their origin , their settlements , and their forms of civil polity . They were settled at very different times , Virginia 150 years before Georgia , and the rest at intermediate periods . They came over to these desert countries under different circumstances . Some of the governments were provincial , some proprietary , and some ( h ) I use the plural as Detoqueville very happily does . o /z/ were chartered . Nay , more  --  some were conquered , as were New York and Jersey , and by the principles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till changed by the stern Jiat of the conquerors . These various peoples were , therefore , essentially distinct and separate , and utterly incapable of amalgamation or oneness : and we must remember that the question is not whether they were sovereign in respect of foreign nations , but whether they were one in regard to each other . But the several colonies were not only different in origin and in organization , but they were perfectly independent in their jurisdiction . No one colony had any pretence of authority or power within the bounds of another . Even under the threatenings of a savage foe one could not call out the militia of another . Hence the early confederations among some of the northern colonies for mutual defence , and hence the abortive attempt shortly anterior to the war of 1756 to establish a more comprehensive union of the colonies . ( i ) These associations and attempts at association successfully repel every notion of oneness between them . If they were one already , where was the necessity of any farther measure to bind them together ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join in those associations ? Why , in the language of chancellor Kent , ( vol. 1 , pa. 205 , ) were they destined to remain longer separate , and in a considerable degree alien commonwealths , jealous of each other 's prosperity , and divided by policy , institutions , prejudice and manners ? Why was the force of these considerations so strong , as to have induced Dr. Franklin ( one of the commissioners to the congress that formed the plan of Union in 1754 ) to have observed that a union of the colonies was absolutely impossible , or at least without being forced by the most grievous tyranny and oppression ? Why did Gov . Pownal concur in the same sentiment , declaring , that the colonies had no one principle of association among them , and that their manner of settlement , diversity of charters , conflicting interests , and mutual rivalships and jealousies rendered union impracticable ? ( Pownal on the Colonies , 35 , 36 , 93. ) ( i ) 1 Kent 202 , 203. /z/ The colonies , indeed , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other , but to have exercised distinctly independent acts of sovereignty , under the control indeed of the king of England , whose subjects they were . Thus , anterior to the revolution , many treaties were made by the respective colonies with the Indians within their boundaries , all of whom were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil , with a right to use , retain and reside upon it , exercising authority over it , governing themselves by their own laws , and having the privilege of selling their lands or not , at their pleasure , to the civilized people who discovered the country . ( j ) Accordingly the several colonies , by treaties , anterior to the revolution , entered , for themselves and on their separate account , into treaties with the Indians in which no other colony had any participation or concern . Thus it would seem that in all things they acted at pleasure , independently of each other ; no one could interfere with another : when they acted in concert it was either by compact or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was severed , they were left without any commune vinculum to hold them together , and each had a separate and distinct power to supply the loss by creating an executive of its own , according to its own notions of propriety and policy . If we consider the matter upon principle it is not less clear . What is it which constitutes nationality or the oneness of people ? A nation or people is a political body united together by common laws and common institutions . To constitute one people , those who compose it must act as one people . It is the unity of action which alone makes those one , who , without it , would be several . Several individuals may unite in a body politic , and by this unity of action be held as one man . Without such unity they must remain , what they are by nature , several . No union of states , indeed , can ever make one people ; for while they continue states , each acts for itself , and that entire unity of action is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of separate action be surrendered , nationality indeed is created , but the states are no more . With what ( j ) 8 Wheat . 543. /z/ propriety can it be affirmed that bodies of people are one people , when they have separate and distinct governments ; of separate and distinct forms ; with distinct and conflicting systems of jurisprudence ; where the judgments of one are held foreign to the other ( as was the case in the colonies ) ; when neither can interfere with or control another , and , in short , when each has the power of governing itself without being dependent on the will of the other ? Judge Story , himself , tells us ( 195 ) that if a state has the sole power of governing itself , and is not dependent on any foreign state , it is called a sovereign state ; from which the corollary seems fair , that every state must be held to be independent and distinct from every other state by which it is not governed . The law-making power seems peculiarly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That which makes for itself laio , and particularly its fundamental law , is so far sovereign . That power of legislation for itself , makes it distinct from others ; for legislation is the action of political bodies , and separate legislation is separate action , which is inconsistent with the notion of unity . ( &); Thus it is that two peoples may have the same king , and yet be separate people : as in the case of Great Britain and Hanover now , and of England and Scotland before the union . The union itself proves that they were not one before . At this day England and Hanover , with the same king , are not involved in the wars of each other . Ireland , too , before the union , was considered as foreign , and the judgments of her courts , and those of Jamaica , of Canada and of India are looked upon as foreign judgments . Even the judgment of the king 's bench is a foreign judgment in Ireland , 2 Str. 1090 ; 4 Barn . &,; Cres. 411 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgment which so pronounces it . But if these portions of the empire are foreign to England , the thirteen colonies must have been foreign to her , and if foreign to her , how much more foreign to Hindostan , or Antigua , or to one another ? There was then nothing of nationality or oneness in the people of the colonies . Each colony was a distinct com- ( k ) 1 Tuck . Black , app. 64 , 65 , citing Hutchinson , Vattel and Burlamaque. /z/ community or body politic ; having its own charter , its own government , its own laws and institutions , and its own right of separate action , under the control indeed of the crown , but not of the sister colonies : and hence , I confidently conclude , that they did not in any sense whatever constitute one people . Unwilling however to leave this important position upon my less forcible arguments , I offer to the student the acute remarks of judge Upshur in his able review of a part of judge Story 's work . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a favourite object with the author to impress upon the mind of the reader , at the very commencement of his work , the idea that the people of the several colonies were , as to some objects , which he has not explained , and to some extent , which he has not defined , ' one people . ' This is not only plainly inferable from the general scope of the book , but is expressly asserted in the following passage : ' But although the colonies were independent of each other in respect to their domestic concerns , they were not wholly alien to each other . On the contrary , they were fellow subjects , and for many purposes one people . Every colonist had a right to inhabit , if he pleased , in any other colony , and as a British subject he was capable of inheriting lands by descent in every other colony . The commercial intercourse of the colonies too was regulated by the general laws of the British empire , and could not be restrained or obstructed by colonial legislation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and striking : ' All the people of this country were then subjects of the king of Great Britain , and owed allegiance to him , and all the civil authority then existing or exercised here flowed from the head of the British empire . They were in a strict sense fellow subjects , and in a variety of respects one people . When the revolution commenced , the patriots did not assert that only the same affinity and social connexion subsisted between the people of the colonies , which subsisted between the people of Gaul , Britain and Spain , while Roman provinces , to wit , only that affinity and social connexion which results from the mere circumstance of beincr governed by the same prince . ' ' /z/ " In this passage the author takes his ground distinctly and boldly . The first idea suggested by the perusal of it is , that he discerned very clearly the necessity of establishing his position , but did not discern quite so clearlv by what process of reasoning he was to accomplish it . If the passage stood alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design to extend the idea of a unity among the people of the colonies beyond the several particulars which he has enumerated . Justice to him requires that we should suppose this ; for , if it had been otherwise , he would scarcely have failed to support his opinion by pointing out some one of the ' many purposes , ' for which the colonies were , in his view of them , ' one people . ' The same may be said of Mr. chief justice Jay . He also has specified several particulars in which he supposed this unity to exist , and arrives at the conclusion , that the people of the several colonies were . ' in a variety of respects , one people . ' In what respect they were ' one , ' except those which he has enumerated , he does not say , and of course it is fair to preMime that he meant to rest the justness of his conclusion upon them alone . The historical facts stated by both of these gentlemen are truly stated ; but it is surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every one of them is the result of the relation between the colonics cinel the mo titer country , and not the result of the relation between the colonies themselves . Every British subject , whether born in England proper or in a colony , has a right to reside any where within the British realm : and this by the force of British lairs . Such is the right of every Englishman , wherever he may be found . As to the right of the colonist to inherit lands by descent in any other colony than his own , our author himself informs us that it belonged to him ' as a British subject . ' That right , indeed , is a consequence of his allegiance . By the policy of the British constitution and laws , it is not permitted that the soil of her territory should belong to any from whom she can not demand all the duties o allegiance . This allegiance is the same in all the colonies as it is in England proper ; and , wherever it exists , the correspondent right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate commercial intercourse among her colonies belong , of course , to the parent country , unless she relinquishes it by some act of /z/ her own ; and no such act is shewn in the present case . On the contrary , although that right was resisted for a time by some of the American colonies , it was finally yielded , as our author himself informs us , by all those of New England , and I am not informed that it was denied by any other . Indeed , the supremacy of parliament , in most matters of legislation which concerned the colonies , was generally  --  nay , univirsally  --  admitted , up to the very eve of the revolution . It is true , the right to tax the colonies was denied , but this was upon a wholly different principle . It was the right of every British subject to be exempt from taxation , except by his own consent ; and as the colonies were not , and from their local situation could not be , represented in parliament , the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental principle of English libertv . But the right of the mother country to regulate commerce among her colonies is of a different character , and it never was denied to England by her American colonies , so long as a hope of reconciliation remained to them . In like manner , the facts relied on by Mr. Jay , that ' all the people of this country were then subjects of the king of Great Britain , and owed allegiance to him , ' and that ' all the civil authority then existing or exercised here rlowed from the head of the British empire . ' are but the usual incidents of colonial dependence , and are by no means peculiar to the case he was considering . They do . indeed , prove a unity between all the colonies and the mother country , and shew that , these , taken altogether , are , in the strictest sense of the terms , ' one people ; ' but I am at a loss to perceive how they prove , that two or more parts or subdivisions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be true of the colonies , it is equally true of anv two or more geographical sections of England proper ; for every one of the reasons assigned applies as strictly to this case as to that of the colonies . Any two countries mav be ; one people , " or ; a nation de fad thev can be made so by the facts that their people are ' subjects of the king of Great Britain , and owe allegiance to him , ' and that ; all the civil authority exercised therein flows from the head o the British empire . ' " It is to be regretted that the author has not given us his own views of the sources from which these several /z/ rights and powers were derived . If they authorize his conclusion , that there was any sort of unity among the people of the several colonies , distinct from their common connexion with the mother country , as parts of the same empire , it must be because they flowed from something in the relation betwixt the colonies themselves , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it enough that these rights and powers should , in point of fact , flow from the relation of the colonies to one another ; they must be the necessary result of their political condition . Even admitting , then , that they would , under any state of circumstances , warrant the conclusion which the author has drawn from them , it does not follow that the conclusion is correctly drawn in the present instance . For aught that he has said to the contrary , the right of every colonist to inhabit and inherit lands in every colony , whether his own or not , may have been derived from positive compact and agreement among the colonies themselves ; and this presupposes that they were distinct and separate , and not ' one people . ' And so far as the rights of the mother country are concerned , they existed in the same form , and to the same extent , over every other colony of the empire . Did this make the people of all the colonies ' one people ? ' If so , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadas are , for the very same reason , ' one people ' at this day . If a common allegiance to a common sovereign , and a common subordination to his jurisdiction , are suihcient to make the people of different countries ' one people , ' it is not perceived ( with all deference to Mr. chief justice Jay ) why the people of Gaul , Britain and Spain might not have been ' one people , ' while Roman provinces , notwithstanding ' the patriots ' did not say so . The general relation between colonies and the parent country is as well settled and understood as any other , and it is precisely the same in all cases , except where special consent and agreement may vary it . Whoever , therefore , would prove that any peculiar unity existed between the American colonies , is bound to shew something in their charters , or some peculiarity in their condition , to exempt them from the general rule . Judge Story was too well acquainted with the state of the facts to make any such attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co- /z/ lonies , which assembled at New York , in October 1765 , declare , that the colonists ' owe the same allegiance to the crown of Great Britain , that is owing from his subjects born within the realm , and all due subordination to that august body , the parliament of Great Britain . '  --  ' That the colonists are entitled to all the inherent rights and liberties of his the king 's natural born subjects within the kingdom of Great Britain . ' We have here an all-sufficient foundation of the right of the crown to regulate commerce among the colonies , and of the right of the colonists to inhabit and to inherit land in each and all the colonies . They were nothing more than the ordinary rights and liabilities of every British subject ; and , indeed , the most that the colonies ever contended for was an equality , in these respects , with the subjects born in England . The facts , therefore , upon which our author 's reasoning is founded , spring from a different source from that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support his conclusion . " So far as the author 's argument is concerned , the subject might be permitted to rest here . Indeed , one would be tempted to think , from the apparent carelessness and indifference with which the argument is urged , that he himself did not attach to it any particular importance . It is not his habit to dismiss grave matters with such slight examination , nor does it consist with the character of his mind to be satisfied with reasoning which bears even a doubtful relation to his subject . Neither can it be supposed that he would be willing to rely on the simple ipse dixit of chief justice Jay , unsupported by argument , unsustained by any references to historical facts , and wholly indefinite in extent and bearing . Why , then , was this passage written ? As mere history , apart from its bearing on the constitution of the United States , it is of no value in this work , and is wholly out of place . All doubts upon this point will be removed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , throughout his entire work , is to establish the doctrine , that the constitution of the United States is a government of ' the people of the United States , ' as contradistinguished from the people of the several states ; or , in other words , that it is a consolidated , and not a federative system . His construction of every con- /z/ tested federal power depends mainly upon this distinction ; and hence the necessity of establishing a oneness among the people of the several colonies , prior to the revolution . It may well excite our surprise , that a proposition so necessary to the principal design of the work , should be stated with so little precision , and dismissed with so little effort to sustain it by argument . One so well informed as judge Story , of the state of political opinions in this country , could scarcely have supposed that it would be received as an admitted truth , requiring no examination . It enters too deeply into grave questions of constitutional law , to be so summarily disposed of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving that the author has assigned no sufficient reason for the opinion he has advanced . The subject demands of us the still farther proof that his opinion is , in fact , erroneous , and that it can not be sustained by any other reasons . " In order to constitute ' one people , ' in a political sense , of the inhabitants of different countries , something more is necessary than that they should owe a common allegiance to a common sovereign . Neither is it sufficient that , in some particulars , they are bound alike , by laws which that sovereign may prescribe : nor does the question depend on geographical relations . The inhabitants of different islands may be one people , and those of contiguous countries may be , as we know they in fact are , different nations . By the term ' people , ' as here used , we do not mean merely a number of persons . We mean by it a political corporation , the members of which owe a common allegiance to a common sovereignty , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bound by no laws except such as that sovereignty may prescribe ; who owe to one another reciprocal obligations ; who possess common political interests ; who are liable to common political duties ; and who can exert no sovereign power except in the name of the whole . Any thing short of this , would be an imperfect definition of that political corporation which we call a people . ' " Tested by this definition , the people of the American colonies were , in no conceivable sense , ' one people . ' They owed , indeed , allegiance to the British king , as the head of each colonial government , and as forming a part /z/ thereof ; but this allegiance was exclusive , in each colony , to its own government , and , consequently , to the king as the head thereof , and was not a common allegiance of the people of all the colonies to a common head . ( Z ) These colonial governments were clothed with the sovereign power of making laws , and of enforcing obedience to them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no allegiance to the government of any other colony , and were not bound by its laws . The colonies had no common legislature , no common treasury , no common military power , no common judicatory . The people of one colony were not liable to pay taxes to any other colony , nor to bear arms in its defence ; they had no right to vote in its elections ; no influence or control in its municipal government , no interest in its municipal institutions . There was no prescribed form by which the colonies could act together , for any purpose whatever ; they were not known as ' one people ' in any one function of government . Although they were all , alike , dependencies of the British crown , yet , even in the action of the parent country , in regard to them , they were recognized as separate and distinct . They were established at different times , and each under an authority from the crown , which applied to itself alone . They were not even alike in their organization . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each derived its form of government from the particular instrument establishing it , or from assumptions of power acquiesced in by the crown , without any connexion with , or relation to , any other . They stood upon the same footing , in every respect , with other British colonies , with nothing to distinguish their relation either to the parent country or to one another . The charter of any one of them might have been destroyed , without in any manner affecting the rest . In point of fact , the charters of nearly all of them were altered , from time to time , and the whole character of their governments changed . These changes were made in each colony for itself alone , some- ( Z ) The resolutions of Virginia , in 1769 , shew that she considered herself merely as an appendage of the British crown ; that her legislature was alone authorized to tax her ; and that she had aright to call on her king , who was also king of England , to protect her against the usurpations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes by the power and authority of the crown ; but never by the joint agency of any other colony , and never with reference to the wishes or demands of any other colony . Thus they were separate and distinct in their creation ; separate and distinct in the forms of their governments ; separate and distinct in the changes and modifications of their governments , which were made from time to time ; separate and distinct in political functions , in political rights , and in political duties . " The provincial government of Virginia was the first established . The people of Virginia owed allegiance to the British king , as the head of their own local government . The authority of that government was confined within certain geographical limits , known as Virginia , and all who lived within those limits were ' one people . ' When the colony of Plymouth was subsequently settled , were the people of that colony ' one ' with the people of Virginia ? When , long afterwards , the proprietary government of Pennsylvania was established , were the followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plymouth and Virginia ? If so , to which government was their allegiance due ? Virginia had a government of her own , Pennsylvania a government of her own , and Massachusetts a government of her own . The people of Pennsylvania could not be equally bound by the laws of all three governments , because those laws might happen to conflict ; they could not owe the duties of citizenship to all of them alike , because they might stand in hostile relations to one another . Either , then , the government of Virginia , which originally extended over the whole territory , continued to be supreme therein , ( subject only to its dependence upon the British crown , ) or else its supremacy was yielded to the new government . Every one knows that this last was the case ; that within the territory of the new government the authority of that government alone prevailed . How then could the people of this new government of Pennsylvania be said to be ' one ' with the people of Virginia , when they were not citizens of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when their allegiance to another government might place them in the relation of enemies of Virginia ? " In farther illustration of this point , let us suppose that some one of the colonies had refused to unite in the de- /z/ claration of independence ; what relation would it then have held to the others ? Not having disclaimed its allegiance to the British crown , it would still have continued to be a British colony , subject to the authority of the parent country , in all respects as before . Could the other colonies have rightfully compelled it to unite with them in their revolutionary purposes , on the ground that it was part and parcel of the ' one people , ' known as the people of the colonies ? No such right was ever claimed , or dreamed of , and it will scarcely be contended for now , in the face of the known history of the time . Such recusant colony would have stood precisely as did the Canadas , and every other part of the British empire . The colonies which had declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would not have had a right to treat them as traitors , or as disobedient citizens resisting their authority . To what purpose , then , were the people of the colonies ' one people , ' if , in a case so important to the common welfare , there was no right in all the people together , to coerce the members of their own community to the performance of a common duty ? " It is thus apparent that the people of the colonies were not ' one people , ' as to any purpose involving allegiance on the one hand , or protection on the other . What then , I again ask , are the ' many purposes ' to which the author alludes ? It is certainly incumbent on him who asserts this identity , against the inferences most naturally deducible from the historical facts , to shew at what time , by what process , and for what purposes , it was effected . He claims too much consideration for his personal authority , when he requires his readers to reject the plain information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The charters of the colonies prove no identity between them , but the reverse ; and it has already been shewn that this identity is not the necessary result of their common relation to the mother country . By what other means they came to be ' one , ' in any intelligible and political sense , it remains for the author to explain . " If these views of the subject be not convincing , the author himself has furnished proof , in all needful abundance , of the incorrectness of his own conclusion . He tells us that , ' though the colonies had a common origin , and owed /z/ a common allegiance , and the inhabitants of each were British subjects , they had no direct political connexion with each other . Each was independent of all the others ; each , in a limited sense was sovereign within its own territory . There was neither alliance nor confederacy between them . The assembly of one province could not make laws for another , nor confer privileges which were to be enjoyed or exercised in another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As colonies they were also excluded from all connexion with foreign states . They were known only as dependencies , and they followed the fate of the parent country , both in peace and war , without having assigned to them , in the intercourse or diplomacy of nations , any distinct or independent existence . They did not possess the poicer of forming any league or treaty among themselves , which would acquire an obligatory force , without the assent of the parent state . And though their mutual wants and necessities often induced them to associate for common purposes of defence , these confederacies were of a casual and temporary nature , and were allowed as an indulgence , rather than as a right . They made several efforts to procure the establishment of some general superintending government over them all ; but their own differences of opinion , as well as the jealousy of the crown , made these efforts abortive . ' " The English language affords no terms stronger than those which are here used to convey the idea of separateness , distinctness and independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description plainer , or more full and complete . The unity , contended for by the author , no where appears , but it is distinctly disaffirmed in every sentence . The colonies were not only distinct in their creation , and in the powers and faculties of their governments , but there was not even ' an alliance or confederacy between them . ' They had no ' general superintending government over them all , ' and tried in vain to establish one . Each was ' independent of all the others , ' having its own legislature , and without power to confer either right or privilege beyond its own territory . ' Each , in a limited sense , was sovereign within its own territory ; ' and to sum up all , in a single sentence , ' they had no direct political connexion with each other ! ' The condition /z/ of the colonies was , indeed , anomalous , if our author 's view of it be correct . They presented the singular spectacle of ' one people , ' or political corporation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , ' and who had not the power to form such connexion , even ' by league or treaty among themselves . ' " This brief review will , it is believed , be sufficient to convince the reader , that our author has greatly mistaken the real condition and relation of the colonies , in supposing that they formed ' one people , ' in any sense , or for any purpose whatever . He is entitled to credit , however , for the candour with which he has stated the historical facts . Apart from all other sources of information , his book affords to every reader abundant materials for the formation of his own opinion , and for enabling him to decide satisfactorily whether the author 's inferences from the facts , which he himself has stated , be warranted by them , or not . " /z/ So much , young gentlemen , for the oneness of the colonies as such . We will now proceed to another singular position of the learned commentator on the constitution , in furtherance of his favourite theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain his views of the anti-revolutionary state of the colonies , he proceeds to consider their condition during the throes of the revolution , and contends that neither anterior to the declaration of independence , nor subsequent to that event , were the former colonies " sovereign and independent states in the sense in which the term sovereign is applied to states . " As the positions of judge Story are very frequently ingeniously insinuated , rather than distinctly announced , and as I am unwilling to misstate his opinions , or do injustice to his arguments , I shall insert the whole of this passage in a note. (  --  ) ( a ) 200 . No redress of grievances having followed upon the many appeals made to the king , and to parliament , by and in behalf of the colonies , either conjointly or separately , it became obvious to them , that a closer union and co-operation were necessary to vindicate their rights and protect their liberties . If a resort to arms should be indispensable , it was impossible to hope for success , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought , it was as clear , that the voice of the colonies must be heard , and their power felt in a national organization . In 1774 Massachusetts recommended the assembling of a continental congress to deliberate upon the state of public affairs : and according to her recommendation , delegates were appointed by the colonies for a congress , to be held in Philadelphia in the autumn of the same year . In some of the legislatures of the colonies , which were then in session , delegates were appointed by the popular , or representative branch ; and in other cases they were appointed by conventions of the people in the colonies. * The congress of delegates ( calling themselves in their more formal acts " the delegates appointed by the good people of these colonies , " assembled on the 4th of September 1774 ; f and having chosen officers , they adopted certain fundamental rules for their proceedings . /z/ In the commencement of this sketch of the state of the colonies during the revolution , we are told that a congress was recommended by Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspices , and with the consent of the people , acting directly in their primary , sovereign capacity , and without the intervention of the functionaries , to whom the ordinary powers of government were delegated in the colonies , the first general or national government , which has been very aptly called " the revolutionary government , " since in its origin and progress it was wholly conducted upon revolutionary principles. * The congress , thus assembled , exercised de facto and de jure a sovereign authority ; not as the delegated agents of the governments de facto of the colonies , but in virtue of original powers derived from the people . The revolutionary government , thus formed , terminated only , when it was regularly superceded by the confederated government under the articles finally ratified , as we shall hereafter see , in 1731. t 202 . The first and most important of their acts was a declaration , that in determining questions in this congress , each colony or province should have one vote ; and this became the established course during the revolution . They proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May , in the next year . They appointed committees to take into consideration their rights and grievances . They passed resolutions , that " after the 1st of December 1774 , there shall be no importation into British America from Great Britain or Ireland of any goods , &c.; or from any other place , of any such goods , as shall have been exported from Great Britain or Ireland ; " that " after the 10th of September 1775 , the exportation of all merchandize , &c.; to Great Britain , Ireland , and the West Indies ought to cease , unless the grievances of America are redressed before that time . " $ They adopted a declaraof rights , not differing in substance from that of the congress of 1765 , and affirming , that the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England and the benefit of such English statutes , as existed at the time of their colonization , and which they have by experience respectively found to be applicable to their local and other circumstances . They also , in behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of association , containing an agreement of non-importation , non-exportation , and non-consumption , in order to carry into effect the preceding resolves ; and also an agreement to discontinue the slave-trade .

In May 1775 , a second congress of delegates met from all the states . These delegates were chosen , as the preceding had * 9 Dane 's Abridg . App .

This was followed up by a resolution , that the colonies be immediately put into a state of defence . They prohibited the receipt and negotiation of any British government bills , and the supply of any provisions or necessaries for the British army and navy in Massachusetts or transports in their service . They recommended to Massachusetts to consider the offices of governor and lieutenant governor of that province vacant , and to make choice of a counsel by the representatives in assembly , by whom the powers of government should be exercised , until a governor of the king 's appointment should consent to govern the colony according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , and appointed general Washington commander in chief , to whom they gave a commission in the name of the delegates of the united colonies . They had previously authorized certain military measures , and especially the arming of the militia of New York , and the occupation of Crown Point and Ticonderoga . They authorized the emission of two millions of dollars in bills of credit , pledging the colonies to the redemption thereof . They framed rules for the government of the army , they published a solemn declaration of the causes of their taking up arms , an address to the king , entreating a change of measures , and an address to the people of Great Britain , requesting their aid , and admonishing them of the threatening evils of a separation . They erected a general post-office , and organized the department for all the colonies . They apportioned the quota that each colony should pay of the bills emitted by congress . 204 . At a subsequent adjournment , they authorized the equipment of armed vessels to intercept supplies to the British , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exportations , except from colony to colony under the inspection of committees .

On the tenth of June it was resolved , that a committee be appointed to prepare a declaration , " that these united colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent states ; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown ; and that all political connexion between them and the state of Great Britain is , and ought to be , dissolved .

" 206 . These minute details have been given , not merely , because they present an historical view of the actual and slow progress towards independence ; but because they give rise to several very important considerations respecting the political rights and sovereignty of the several colonies , and of the union , which was thus spontaneously formed by the people of the united colonies . 207 . In the first place , antecedent to the Declaration of Independence , none of the colonies were , or pretended to be sovereign states , in the sense , in which the term " sovereign " is sometimes applied to states. * The term " sovereign " or " sovereignty " is used in different senses , which often leads to a confusion of ideas , and sometimes to very mischievous and unfounded conclusions . By " sovereignty " in its largest sense is meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summi imperii the absolute right to govern . A state or nation is a body politic , or society of men , united together for the purpose of promoting their mutal safety and advantage by their combined strength . By the very act of civil and political association , each citizen subjects himself to the authority of the whole ; and the authority of all over each member essentially belongs to the body politic . A state , which possesses this absolute power , without any dependence upon any foreign power or state , is in the largest sense a sovereign state . And it is wholly immaterial , what is the form of the government , or by whose hands this absolute authority is exercised . It may be exercised by the people at large , as in a pure democracy ; or by a select few , as in an absolute aristocracy ; or by a single person , as in an absolute monarchy. ! ! But " sovereignty " is often used in a far more limited sense , than that , of which we have spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of the particular state or nation are to be exclusively exercised by certain public functionaries , without the control of any superior authority . It is in this sense , that Blackstone employs it , when he says , that it is of " the very essence of a law , that it is made by the supreme power . Sovereignty and legislature are , /z/ virtue of original powers derived from the people . " Now in this short passage there is a material misstatement even according to the learned author himself . He here says , that indeed , convertible terms ; one can not subsist without the other . " * Now , in every limited government the power of legislation is , or at least may be , limited at the will of the nation ; and therefore the legislature is not in an absolute sense sovereign . It is in the same sense , that Blackstone says , " the law ascribes to the king of England the attribute of sovereignty or pre-eminence , " t because in respect to the powers confided to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no man , and subjected to no superior jurisdiction . Yet the king of England can not make a law ; and his acts , beyond the powers assigned to him by the constitution , are utterly void . 208 . In like manner the word " state " is used in various senses . In in its most enlarged sense it means the people composing a particular nation or community . In this sense the state means the whole people , united into one body politic ; and the state , and the people of the state , are equivalent expressions . Mr. Justice Wilson in his Law Lectures , uses the word " state " in its broadest sense . " In free states , " says he , " the people form an artificial person , or body politic , the highest and noblest , that can be known . They form that moral person , which in one of my former lectures , I described , as a complete body of free , natural persons , united together for their common benefit ; as having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and acting ; as possessed of interests , which it ought to manage ; as enjoying rights , which it ought to maintain ; and as lying under obligations , which it ought to perform . To this moral person , we assign , by way of eminence , the dignified appellation of " state . " But there ' is a more limited sense , in which the word is often used , where it expresses merely the positive or actual organization of the legislative , executive , or judicial powers . Ti Thus , the actual government of a state is frequently designated by the name of the state . We say , the state has power to do this or that ; the state has passed a law ' qwq 1800 , adverts to the different senses , in which the word " state " is used . He says , " It is indeed true , that the term @#@ states ' is sometimes used in a vague sense , and sometimes in different senses , according to the subject , to which it is applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occupied by the political societies within each ; sometimes the particular governments established by those societies ; sometimes those societies , as organized into those particular governments ; and lastly , it means the people , composing those political societies in their highest sovereign capacity . " /z/ " the members of the congress acted not as the delegated agents of the governments de facto , but in virtue of original powers derived from the people . " And yet in the next or prohibited an act , meaning no more than , that the proper functionaries , organized for that purpose , have power to do the act , or have passed the law , or prohibited the particular action . The sovereignty of a nation or state , considered with reference to its association , as a body politic , may be absolute and uncontrollable in all respects , except the limitations , which it chooses to impose upon itself But the sovereignty of the government , organized within the state , may be of a very limited nature . It may extend to few , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ; it may be restrained , as to others . To the extent of the power given , the government may be sovereign , and its acts may be deemed the sovereign acts of the state . . Nay the state , by which we mean the people composing the state , may divide its sovereign powers among various functionaries , and each in the limited sense would be sovereign in respect to the powers , confided to each ; and dependent in all other cases. ! Strictly speaking , in our republican forms of government , the absolute sovereignty of the nation is in the people of the nation ; and the residuary sovereignty of each state , not granted to any of its public functionaries , is in the people of the state . t 209 . There is another mode , in which we speak of a state as sovereign , and that is in reference to foreign states . Whatever may be the internal organization of the government of any state , if it has the sole power of governing itself , and is not dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ; that is , it is a state having the same rights , privileges , and powers , as other independent states . It is inlhis sense , that the term is generally used in treatises and discussions on the law of nations . A full consideration of this subject will more properly find place in some future /z/ * 2 Dall. 433 ; Iredell J. Id . 455 , 456 . Per Wilson J. 1 3 Dall. 93 . Per Iredell J. 2 Dall. 455 , 457 . Per Wilson J. 12 Dall. 471 , 472 . Per Jay C. J. Mr. J. a . Adams , in his Oration on the 4th of July 1831 , published after the preparation of these commentaries , uses the following language : " It is not true , that there must reside in all governments an absolute , uncontrollable , irresistible and despotic power ; nor is such power in any manner essential to sovereignty . Uncontrollable power exists in no government on earth . The sternest despotisms in any region and in every age of the world , are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; and rotten will be the foundation of every government , leaning upon such a maxim for its support . Least of all can it be predicated of a government , professing to be founded upon an original compact . The pretence of an absolute irresistible , despotic power , existing in every government somewhere , is incompatible with the first principles of natural right . " Dr. Rush , in a political communication , in 1786 , uses the term " sovereignty " in another , and somewhat more limited sense. * He says , " The people of America have mistaken the meaning of the word ' sovereignty . ' Hence each state pretends to be sovereign . In Europe it is applied to those states , which possess the power of making war and peace , of forming treaties , and the like . /z/ preceding section we are told that " in some of the legislatures of the colonies , which were then in session , delegates were appointed by the - popular or representative 210 . Now it is apparent , that none of the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general sense , independent , or sovereign communities . They were all originally settled under , and subjected to the British crown. * Their powers and authorities were derived from , and limited by their respective charters . All , or nearly all , of these charters controlled their legislation by prohibiting them from making laws repugnant , or contrary to those of England . The crown , in many of them , possessed a negative upon their legislation , as well as the exclusive appointment of their superior officers ; and a right of revision , by way of appeal , of the judgments of their courts . t In their most solemn declarations of rights , they admitted themselves bound , as British subjects , to allegiance to the British crown ; and as such , they claimed to be entitled to all the rights , liberties and immunities of free born British subjects . They denied all power of taxation , except by their own colonial legislatures ; but at the same time they admitted themselves bound by acts of the British parliament for the regulation of external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole empire to the mother country , and the commercial benefits of its respective members So far , as respects foreign states , the colonies were not , in the sense of the laws of nations , sovereign states ; but mere dependencies of Great Britain . They could make no treaty , declare no war , send no ambassadors , regulate no intercourse or commerce , nor in any other shape act , as sovereigns , in the negotiations usual between independent states . In respect to each other , they stood in the common relation of British subjects ; the legislation of neither could be controlled by any other ; but there was a common subjection to the British crown . If in any sense they might claim the attributes of sovereignty , it was only in that subordinate sense , to which we have alluded , as exercising within a limited extent certain usual powers of sovereignty . They did not even affect to claim a local allegiance . 211 . In the next place , the colonies did not severally act for themselves , and proclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this power belongs only to congress , they are the only sovereign power in the United States .

How many were appointed in one mode , and how many in the other , I have some of the states had previously formed incipient governments for themselves ; but it was done in compliance with the recommendations of congress. * Virginia , on the 29th of June 1776 , by a convention of delegates , declared " the government of this country , as formerly exercised under the crown of Great Britain , totally dissolved ; " and proceeded to form a new constitution of government . New Hampshire also formed a government in December 1775 , which was manifestly intended to be temporary , " during ( as they said ) the unhappy and unnatural contest with Great Britain . " ! New Jersey , too , established a frame of government , on the 2d of July 1776 ; but it was expressly declared that it should be void upon a reconciliation with Great Britain. !

It was , therefore , the achievement of the whole for the benefit of the whole . The people of the united colonies made the united colonies free and independent states , and absolved them from all allegiance to the British crown .

' The separate independence and individual sovereignty of the several states were never thought of by the enlightened band of patriots , who framed this declaration .

Miller , Charleston , 1831 , p. 43,44.  --  Mr. Adams , in his Oration on the 4th of July 1831 , which is valuable for its views of constitutional principles , insists upon the same doctrine at considerable length . Though it has been published since the original preparation of these lectures , I gladly avail myself of an opportunity to use his authority in corroboration of the same views . " The union of the colonies had preceded this declaration , of independence , and even the commencement of the war . The declaration was joint , that the united colonies were free and independent states , but not that any one of them was a free and independent state , separate from the rest . "  --  " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole people covenanted with each citizen , and each citizen with the whole people , that the united colonies were , and of right ought to be , free and independent states . To this compact union was as vital , as freedom or independence . "  --  " The declaration of independence announced the severance of the thirteen united colonies from the rest of the British empire , and the existence of their people from that day forth as an independent nation . The people of all the colonics , speaking by their representatives , constituted themselves one moral person before the face of their fellow men . "  --  " The declaration of independence was not a declaration of liberty merely acquired , nor was it a form of government . The people of the colonies were already free , and their forms of government were various . They were all colonies of a monarchy . The king of Great Britain was their common sovereign . " /z/ possessed any . It would be sufficient to demonstrate that the popular branch of the state legislatures were in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 213 . In the next place we have seen , that the power to do this act was not derived from the state governments ; nor was it done generally with their co-operation . The question then naturally presents itself , if it is to be considered as a national act , in what manner did the colonies become a nation , and in what manner did congress become possessed of this national power ? The true answer must be , that as soon as congress assumed powers and passed measures , which were in their nature national , to that extent the people , from whose acquiescence and consent they took effect , must be considered as agreeing to form a nation. * The congress of 1774 , looking at the general terms of the commissions , under which the delegates were appointed , seem to have possessed the power of concerting such measures , as they deemed best , to redress the grievances , and preserve the rights and liberties of all the colonies . Their duties seem to have been principally of an advisory nature ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow out the wishes and objects of their constituents , than scrupulously to examine the words , in which their authority was communicated . t The congress of 1775 and 1776 were clothed with more ample powers , and the language of their commissions generally was sufficiently broad to embrace the right to pass measures of a national character and obligation . The caution necessary at that period of the revolutionary struggle rendered that language more guarded , than the objects really in view would justify ; but it was foreseen , that the spirit of the people would eagerly second every measure adopted to further a general union and resistance against the British claims . The congress of 1775 accordingly assumed at once ( as we have seen ) the exercise of some of the highest functions of sovereignty . They took measures for national defence and resistance ; they followed up the prohibitions upon trade and intercourse with Great Britain ; they raised a national army and navy , and authorized limited national hostilities against Great Britain ; they raised money , emitted bills of credit , and contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office ; and finally they authorized captures and condemnation of prizes in prize courts , with a reserve of appellate jurisdiction to themselves . 214 . The same body , in 1776 , took bolder steps , and exerted powers , which could in no other manner be justified or accounted for , than upon the supposition , that a national union for national purposes already existed , and that the congress was invested with sovereign power over all the colonies for the purpose of preserving the common rights and liberties of all . They accordingly authorized general hostilities against the persons and property of British /z/ the congress was in fact not national but federative in its character . But this is placed beyond all reasonable question by two considerations , to neither of which has the learned author thought fit to advert . subjects ; they opened an extensive commerce with foreign countries , regulating the whole subject of imports and exports ; they authorized the formation of new governments in the colonies ; and finally they exercised the sovereign prerogative of dissolving the allegiance of all colonies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never doubted , or denied by the people . On the contrary , they became the foundation , upon which the superstructure of the liberties and independence of the United States has been erected . Whatever , then , may be the theories of ingenious men on the subject , it is historically true , that before the declaration of independence these colonies were not , in any absolute sense , sovereign states ; that that event did not find them or make them such ; but that at the moment of their separation they were under the dominion of a superior controlling national government , whose powers were vested in and exercised by the general congress with the consent of the people of all the states . " 215 . From the moment of the declaration of independence , if not for most purposes at an antecedent period , the united colonies must be considered as being a nation dc facto , having a general government over it created , and acting by the general consent of the people of all the colonies . The powers of that government were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But still its exclusive sovereignty , in many cases , was firmly established ; and its controlling power over the states was in most , if not in all national measures , universally admitted . t The articles of confederation , of which we shall have occasion to speak more hereafter , were not prepared or adopted by congress until November 1777 ; r. they were not signed or ratified by any of the states until July 1778 ; and they were not ratified , so as to become obligatory upon all the states , until March 1781 .

R. 18/ , ) admits , that tire states , before the formation of the constitution , were sovereign and independent , and were connected with each other only by a league , it " manifest , that he uses the word " sovereign " in a very restricted sense . Und the confederation there were many limitations upon the powers of the states . f See Pcnhaihno v. Doane , 3 Dall . R. 54 ; Ware v. Hylton , 3 Dall. 199 , per Chase J. See the Circular Letter of Congress , 13th September 1779 ; 5 Jour .

And though they constantly admitted the states to be " sovereign and independent communities ; " * yet it must be obvious , that the terms were used in the subordinate and limited sense already alluded to ; for it was impossible to use them in any other sense , since a majority of the states could by their public acts in congress control and bind the minority . Among the exclusive powers exercised by congress , were the power to declare war and make peace ; to authorize captures ; to institute appellate prize courts ; to direct and control all national , military , and naval operations ; to form alliances , and make treaties ; to contract debts , and issue bills of credit upon national account . In respect to foreign governments , we were politically known as the United States only ; and it was in our national capacity , as such , that we sent , and received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted into the general community of nations , who might exercise the right of belligerents , and claim an equality of sovereign powers and prerogatives. ! 216. in confirmation of these views , it may not be without use to refer to the opinions of some of our most eminent judges , delivered on occasions , which required an exact examination of the subject . In Chishohn 's Executors v. The State of Georgia , ( 2 Dall. 419 , 470 , t ) Mr. chief justice Jay , who was equally distinguished as a revolutionary statesman and a general jurist , expressed himself to the following effect : " The revolution , or rather the declaration of independence , found the people already united for general purposes , and at the same time providing for their more domestic concerns by state conventions , and other temporary arrangements . From the crown of Great Britian the sovereignty of their country passed to the people of it ; and it was then not an uncommon opinion , that the unappropriated lands , which belonged to that crown , passed , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits they were situated , but to the tchole people . On whatever principle this opinion rested , it did not give way to the other ; and thirteen sovereignties were considered as emerging from the principles of the revolution , combined by local convenience and considerations . The people , nevertheless , continued to consider themselves , in a national point of view , as one people ; and they continued without interruption to manage their national concerns accordingly . " In Penhallow v. Doane , ( 3 Dall . R. 54 , ) Mr. justice Patterson ( who was also a revolutionary statesman ) said , speaking of the period before the ratification of the confederation : * See Letter of 17th Nov. 1777 , by Congress , recommending the articles of confederation ; Journal of 1777 , p. 513 , 514. /z/ lative bodies of the respective states .

Congress raised armies , fitted out a navy , and prescribed rules for their government , fec . &c.; These high acts of sovereignty were submitted to , acquiesced in , and approved of by the people of America , fec . &c.; The danger being imminent and common , it became necessary for the people or colonies to coalesce and act in concert , in order to divert , or break the violence of the gathering storm . They accordingly grew into union , and formed one great political body , of which congress was the directing principle and soul , &lc.; &c.; The truth is , that the states , individually , were not known , nor recognized as sovereign by foreign nations , nor are they now . The states collectively under congress , as their connecting point or head , were acknowledged by foreign powers , as sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is applicable to all great national concerns , and in the exercise of which other sovereigns would be more immediately interested . In Ware v. Hijlton , ( 3 Dall. 190 , * ) Mr. justice Chase ( himself also a revolutionary statesman ) said : " It has been inquired , what powers congress possessed from the first meeting in September 1774 , until the ratification of the confederation on the 1st of March 1781 . It appears to me , that the powers of congress during that whole period were derived from the people they represented , expressly given through the medium of their state conventions or state legislatures ; or , that after they were exercised , they were impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people , &c.; The powers of congress originated from necessity , and arose out of it , and were only limited by events ; or , in other words , they were revolutionary in their nature . Their extent depended on the exigencies and necessities of public affairs . I entertain this general idea , that the several states retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of external sovereignty . In deciding on the powers of congress , and of the several states before the confederation , I see but one safe rule , namely , that all the powers actually exercised by congress before that period were rightfully exercised , on the presumption not to be controverted , that they were so authorized by the people they represented , by an express or implied grant ; and that all the powers exercised by the state conventions or state legislatures were also rightfully exercised , on the same presumption of authority from the people .

Still less was any such appointment the act of the people in a national character , as one people , as contradistinguished from their act in their distinct political characters , as independent states . This brings me to observe , Secondly , that on the question whether the appointment of members of congress was an act of the people , as constituting one nation or not , it is utterly unimportant whether it was made by legislature or convention ,  --  by the representatives of the people , or even by the people themselves in plenis commit Us .

And that the actual powers exercised by congress , in respect to national objects , furnished the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representatives of the people , and were acquiesced in by the people . /z/ out the intervention of the ordinary functionaries . " Admit it . But in what sovereign capacity ? In the capacity of one people , composing one political society , and one sovereignty throughout British America , or as separate people of distinct political societies , uniting together as such for common defence and the maintenance of rights which were common to them all 1 This is the true issue , and history leaves no doubt how it should be decided . The colonies had always been independent of each other , though subject to the crown . The king was the only knot which bound them together . Did the cutting off the common head unite them into one body ? Did cutting the knot have the effect of binding them more closely instead of leaving , to each , entire sovereignty and independence , except so far as it might be voluntarily vested in a common agent , the congress of the United States 1 Surely not . By cutting the only bond which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent states . Their rebellion was not as one people , but as thirteen states . They were not bound to rebel together ; for Canada , which stood in the same position with themselves , never did rebel , and the thirteen states had no right to compel her to do so . ( b ) We can look upon them as acting in no other manner than as communities distinct and independent of each other , each resolving for itself , judging for itself , acting for itself . And so they looked upon themselves . They were commanded by no authority to assemble in congress . The measure was simply recommended by one of the sister states . The members were appointed in each state according to its own ( b ) " When the obnoxious acts passed , " says judge Iredell , ' 3 Dall. 92 , " if the people in each province had chosen to resist separately , they undoubtedly had equal right to do so as to join in general measures of resistance with the people of the other provinces , however unwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been . "  --  " If congress previously to the articles of confederation possesed any authority , it was an authority derived from the people of each province in the first instance . " " I conclude , therefore , that every particle of authority which originally resided either in congress , or in any branch of the state governments , was derived from the people of each province : that this authority was conveyed by each body politic separately , and not by all the people in the several provinces or states jointly , and of course that no authority could be conveyed to the whole but that which previously was possessed by the several parts , " &c.; /z/ pleasure , under its own electoral regulations , and with powers and discretion prescribed by each , and were , moreover , liable to recall . The members when elected voted by states ; ( c ) giving to the smallest state in the Union the same weight in the deliberations of the body with the largest . This is of itself conclusive of the character of the body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent states , who thus united in action and in council for common benefit . But this is not all :  --  every thing in our revolutionary annals distinctly proves , that congress represented states alone , and acted only upon states . Its wants were supplied by requisitions : its commissions were countersigned by the states . It powers were at first little more than advisory , though the exigencies of the revolution compelled them on many occasions to extend them . 3 Dall. 91 . As soon as the provinces took up arms , each state stood of itself as rebel , or quasi sovereign : each in that character assumed upon itself to act ; each in that character might have treated and made peace . That character they held before a congress was appointed . In that character they stood when it was created . It was the creature of those who were de facto sovereign ; and all its powers were not only derivative , but derivative from bodies politic , or societies of people distinct and separate , in the assumed character of sovereign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , of the congress , the states exercised every attribute of sovereignty . Among the memorable instances of this was the act of this venerable commonwealth , the common mother of us all , in declaring herself independent anterior to the 4th of July 1776 , and before that measure had been adopted by the thirteen states in congress assembled . Such was assuredly the effect of the resolutions of the Virginia convention on the 15th day of May 1776 . By those resolutions it was distinctly declared , that " there was no alternative left but abject submission or total separation ; " it was therefore recommended to congress to make a general declaration of independence for all the states , and a committee was appointed to prepare a declaration of rights and apian of government ; all of which was equivalent to an assertion by the state of ( c ) I Story , 202. /z/ her right to self-government , and to take her stand as an independent power among the nations of the earth . And so the ablest minds have ever regarded it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Review of a most interesting passage upon this subject , I shall here offer the vigorous remarks of a very able judge in support of my positions . They were delivered in the celebrated case of Ware v. Hylton , 3 Dall. 199 . In that case , it is said by Mr. Marshall , ( afterwards chief justice of the United States , ) that it had been conceded in the argument that Virginia in 1777 was an independent state , and as such , competent to pass confiscation laws . In delivering his opinion in the case , judge Chase declares the right of confiscation ( which is a. jus belli , belonging to the sovereign alone , ) to have resided only in the legislature of Virginia in relation to the claims of her enemy 's people within her territories . He then proceeds : " It is worthy of remembrance , that delegates and representatives were elected by the people of the several counties and corporations of Virginia , to meet in general convention , for the purpose of framing a new government , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention met on the 6th of May , and continued in session until the 5th of July 1776 ; and , in virtue of their delegated power , established a constitution , or form of government , to regulate and determine by whom , and in what manner , the authority of the people of Virginia was thereafter to be executed . As the people of that country were the genuine source and fountain of all power , that could be rightfully exercised within its limits ; they had therefore an unquestionable right to grant it to whom they pleased , and under what restrictions or limitations they thought proper . The people of Virginia , by their constitution or fundamental law , granted and delegated all their supreme civil power to a legislature , an executive and judiciary ; The first to make ; the second to execute ; and the last to declare or expound , the laws of the commonwealth . This abolition of the old government , and this establishment of a new one , was the highest act of power that any people can exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all dependence on , and connexion with , Great Britain , absolutely and forever ceased ; and no formal declaration of independence was /z/ necessary , although a decent respect for the opinions of mankind required a declaration of the causes , which impelled the separation ; and was proper to give notice of the event to the nations of Europe . I hold it as unquestionable , that the legislature of Virginia , established as I have stated by the authority of the people , was forever thereafter invested with the supreme and sovereign power of the state , and with authority to make any laics in their discretion , to affect the lives , liberties and property of all the citizens of that commonwealth , with this exception only , that such laws should not be repugnant to the constitution or fundamental law , which could be subject only to the control of the body of the nation , in cases not to be defined , and which will always provide for themselves . The legislative power of every nation can only be restrained by its own constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice not to question the validity of any law made in pursuance of the constitution . There is no question but the act of the Virginia legislature ( of the 20th of October 1777 ) was within the authority granted to them by the people of that country ; and this being admitted , it is a necessary result , that the law is obligatory on the courts of Virginia , and , in my opinion , on the courts of the United States . If Virginia , as a sovereign state , violated the ancient or modern law of nations , in making the law of the 20th of October 1777 , she was answerable in her political capacity to the British nation , whose subjects have been injured in consequence of that law . Suppose a general right to confiscate British property , is admitted to be in congress , and congress had confiscated all British property within the United States , including private debts , would it be permitted to contend in any court of the United States , that congress had no power to confiscate such debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right is conceded to be in congress , it necessarily follows , that she is the judge of the exercise of the right , as to the extent , mode and manner . The same reasoning is strictly applicable to Virginia , if considered a sovereign nation ; provided she had not delegated such power to congress , before the making of the law of October 1777 , which I will hereafter consider . /z/ " In June 1776 , the convention of Virginia formally declared , that Virginia was a free , sovereign and independent state ; and on the 4th of July 1776 , following , the United States in congress assembled , declared the thirteen united colonies free and independent states ; and that as such , they had full power to levy war , conclude peace , &c.; I consider this as a declaration , not that the united colonies jointly , in a collective capacity , were independent states , &/C,; but that each of them was a sovereign and independent state ; that is , that each of them had a right to govern itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any control from any other power upon earth . " Before these solemn acts of separation from the crown of Great Britain , the war between Great Britian and the united colonies , jointly and separately , was a civil war ; but instantly , on that great and ever memorable event , the war changed its nature , and became a public war between independent governments ; and immediately thereupon all the rights of public war ( and all the other rights of an independent nation ) attached to the government of Virginia ; and all the former political connexion between Great Britian and Virginia , and also between their respective subjects , were totally dissolved ; and not only the two nations , but all the subjects of each , were in a state of war ; precisely as in the present war between Great Britain and France .

On the 6th of February 1778 , the king of France entered into a treaty of alliance with the United States ; and on the 8th of October 1782 , a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded between the United States and the states general of the United Provinces . I have ever considered it as the established doctrine of the United States , that their independence originated from , and commenced with , the declaration of congress , on the 4th of July 1776 ; and that no other period can be fixed on for its commencement ; and that all laws made by the legislatures of the several states , after the declaration of independence , were the laws of sovereign and independent governments . " /z/ To these remarks of judge Chase , it may be added that in Pcnhallow v. Doanc , ( d ) judge Iredell very clearly sustains the same positions , contending that the jus belli belonged at first to the states as sovereign , and was not possessed by congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial opinions , and the historical facts on which they rest , we find Mr. Storv reiterating the remark " that antecedent to the declaration of independence , none of the colonies pretended to be sovereign states in the sense in which the term sovereign is sometimes applied to states : " and again , " before the revolution none were independent or sovereign communities ; " and again , " from the moment of the declaration of independence , if not for most purposes , at an antecedent period , the United Colonies must be considered as a nation de facto , having a general government over it created , and acting by the general consent of the people of all the colonies ; " obviously meaning as one nation .

These opinions are utterly at war with the first principles of our federal government , as they have been received and handed down to us by the wisest and purest statesmen of both parties .

According to these views , " at the moment of the separation of the colonies from Great Britain , they were under the dominion of a superior controlling national government(f) icJwse powers ( rf ) 3Dall. 92,93,94. ( e ) u From the crown of Great Britain the sovereignty of this country passed to the people of it , " says chief justice Jay very truly . But to what people ? Not to the whole people of the United States as one people , for there was none such , but to the people of the respective states . See post . ( f ) Anterior to the declaration of independence the states still recognized the supremacy of England , and still looked to her as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a go-/z/ were vested in and exercised by the general congress with the consent of the people of all the states ! ! ! ' 1 The states then are not the fountains of power ; they are not the grantors , but the grantees ; not the dispensers , but the recipients ; and as a fair corollary , from these positions , all powers not granted to the states , are reserved to the general government ! ! ! It is obvious that these startling principles should be carefully examined before they are adopted . However great the name under which they are put forth , it is not greater than those of the wise and good who have gone before him , who have ever looked upon the states as great political bodies , endued with all the attributes of sovereignty , and the source from whence the general government of the Union draws all its powers . Let us then first examine the position that at the moment of the separation , in other words , at the date of the declaration of independence , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , whose powers were vested in and exercised by the general congress with the consent of the people of all the states . " I have already sufficiently shewn that under British domination , the colonies , though subject to the crown , were independent of each other ; and that the cutting the only bond which in any manner connected them , could not have the effect of binding them more closely than they had been bound before under their common head . Its obvious effect , on the contrary , was to separate entirely the thirteen distinct political societies , until by some act of their own they should form a connexion , more or less close , according to their pleasure . If this was so , it implies the existence of sovereignty in each from the moment of separation . Judge Story quotes Ch. justice Jay , who says that vernment , but the great organ of a revolution , whose termination was yet hidden from mortal ken . The war was , until July 4 , 1 776 , a civil war , and congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated with until that date , nor did the states indeed consider themselves as individually or collectively constituting a nation . At the moment of the declaration each state emerged into sovereignty and independence , and from that morn nt till the confederation congress was their organ , and had no legitimate authority but that which their commissions gave to the delegates of each . /z/ from the crown of Great Britain the sovereignty of this country passed to the people of it . And this is true when properly understood . A revolting colony in throwing off the authority of the mother country , becomes itself invested with the attributes of sovereignty . Each of the thirteen revolting colonies , therefore , in throwing off the authority of Great Britain became itself a sovereign . The crown had the sovereignty over each , but as they were communities independent of each other , the sovereignty when thrown off passed to the people of each , and not to the people of the whole , for they never had constituted one whole . The whole continent was not our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia passed of course to the people of Virginia , and , accordingly , in this same passage we find chief justice Jay admitting that " thirteen sovereigns were considered as emerging from the principles of the revolution , combined by local convenience and considerations . " They were indeed combined , but combined as states or sovereigns , investing in a general congress formed by their respective delegates ( representing them as states ) a government for the conduct of their combined interests amid the throes of a revolution . What was the character of this government , of this national authority , vested in the general congress ? First , in regard to its formation , was it national or confederate ? The answer is easy ; it was confederate as far as it was a government at all . The delegates were appointed by the states , not by the people ; sometimes , indeed , by conventions , but they were conventions , who as much represented the state as the legislatures could do . Moreover , in the deliberations of congress they voted by states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of confederate character which has been universally admitted . Moreover , each delegation obeyed its own state ; each was removable by its own state , so that the congress partook in no small degree of the character of a congress of ambassadors . But , secondly , this general congress , ( if government it could be called ) was merely revolutionary . It grew up out of the necessities of the times . It was not constituted or established as a government . It was assembled upon recommendation merely , which no state was bound to obey . It acted by recommendation mainly . It had no prescribed /z/ authority . Its powers were not , and could not , well indeed be denned . It continued to exercise the powers of a general government , whose acts were respected and concurred in by the states . It constantly admitted the states to be sovereign and independent communities . ( 1 Story , p. 204 . ) It exercised its powers by sufferance growing out of the situation of the country , which had not yet been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states constituted its justification for the broad powers it often found itself compelled to exercise . Such were the powers of war and peace ; of forming treaties and alliances ; authorizing captures ; establishing courts of prizes , &c.; None of these were conferred , but they were exercised and acquiesced in , because the exigencies of the cause in which we were engaged in common , imperiously demanded it . Lastly , this revolutionary government was ephemeral . The withdrawal of the delegates would have dissolved it , and any state at pleasure might have withdrawn its own , and then it would have been no longer bound by the acts of congress . Moreover , being merely revolutionary , it may be considered as limited at farthest by the continuance of hostilities . Peace would have withered it forever , for it had grown only out of the necessities of revolution and war . It lasted not indeed till peace . It was found but a rope of sand , and in June 1778 the confederation was adopted by all the states except Maryland and Delaware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the union of the states , anterior to that time , " grew out of the exigencies of the times ; and from its nature and objects might be deemed temporary , extending only to the maintenance of the common liberties and independence of the states , and to terminate with the return of peace with Great Britain and the accomplishment of the ends of the revolutionary contest . " It was under this ephemeral government  --  this government of sufferance ; this government , the creature of their own will , and capable of being dissolved at a moment by their own breath , that the states are said to have been at the time of the separation . With what propriety could it be intimated by judge Story that they were " under the dominion of a superior controlling national government " at the time of the adoption of the declaration of independence ? /z/ It is , indeed , most singular that judge Story should so obstinately contend for the existence of this superior controlling power , when he admits that the powers of congress were assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tacit consent of the states . Can this exercise of the powers of government by sufferance constitute sovereignty or supreme controlling power ? Were not the acts of congress , indeed , the acts of the states themselves through their own servants , their delegates ? How could that be a controlling power over them , which was exerted by them , and not by others having authority over them . In other words , how could the delegates of the states , who were their servants , have supreme control over those who were confessedly their masters . Judge Story indeed contends that it was impossible to consider the states as sovereign , because the majority of the states could bind the minority . But when was it ever otherwise in any confederacy or union of states , however cautiously they may have guarded their sovereign powers 1 In every confederacy that ever existed , whether formal or informal , this has been the case . Yet who ever dreamed that the sovereignty of the states was swallowed up in their confederacy ? That sovereignty is essential to its existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain powers in a congress of ambassadors or delegates , but the sovereignty itself is unimpaired , since the power which is given is vicarious , and but the emanation of its own free will . Thus it is even under our constitution which has so many features of nationality , judge Story himself acknowledges the states to be still sovereign , ) notwithstanding the national character he attributes to the constitution . And thus it was , too , under the confederation . The second section of the articles expressly declares the sovereignty and independence of each of the states ; and yet in all its action a minority of states was bound by the decision of a majority . It is then no proof of the loss of their sovereignty that each state was bound by its own consent , by the decision of the majority of all the states in congress assembled . It was necessary ( g ) In Martin v. Hunter , 1 Wheat . 304. /z/ that the states should coalesce , ( A ) or act in concert , and this action could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also often remarked , with an air of triumph , that during the revolutionary war , the states individually were not known nor recognized as sovereign by foreign nations . But the answer is plain : The states , collectively , under congress , as their connecting point or head , were acknowledged by foreign powers as sovereign , and treated with as such ; and the states , even under our present constitution , are acknowledged to be sovereign states , though they are not recognized by foreign nations in their intercourse as such . Judge Story , after quoting judges Patterson and Jay , proceeds to quote judge Chase in page 206 , on this subject of the sovereignty of the states , anterior to the final adoption of the articles of confederation ; but , unfortunately , he has omitted the most forcible passages in the opinion of that able judge , militating against the positions he himself so zealously maintains . This may be seen by comparing the opinion already cited , ante , pa. 46 , with the extract in judge Story 's work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration of independence as a declaration , not that the United Colonies jointly , in a collective capacity , were independent states , but that each of them was an independent state ; that is , that each of them had a right to govern itself by its own authority , and its own laws , without any control from any other power upon earth : ' It seems to me not unworthy of remark , that the learned commentator , in the frequent use of the term " union , " seems never to have duly adverted to its only legitimate use in its application to political societies . He speaks familiarly of the union existing anterior to the declaration of independence . He says , " the union might be deemed temporary , extending only to the maintenance of common liberty and independence of the states . " " Union ! " What does it imply ? Previous separation and disunion of parts ? If so , then the proposition is surrendered as to the original ( h ) Per Patterson , justice . The idea of coalescing between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not coalesced before . /z/ unity or oneness of the colonies . And of what was this union ? Was it of individuals or of political bodies ? If used in relation to the last , it is intelligible , but if applied to the former , it is entirely unrecognized by the political vocabulary . We speak of forming or dissolving a union in reference to states , but no one ever dreamed of calling a national government a union , or of breaking up the very foundations of society itself , when he speaks of dissolution of an union . After thus presenting some of my own views on this interesting topic , I beg leave to add from the author before cited , his much more satisfactory refutation of the heretical notion of the oneness of the colonies and of the states anterior to the declaration of independence : " In the execution of the second division of his plan , very little was required of the author either as a historian or as a commentator . Accordingly , he has alluded but slightly to the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , and has sketched with great rapidity , yet sufficiently in detail , the rise , decline and fall of the confederation . Even here , however , he has fallen into some errors , and has ventured to express decisive and important opinions without due warrant . The desire to make ' the people of the United States ' one consolidated nation , is so strong and predominant , that it breaks forth , often uncalled for , in every part of his work . He tells us that the first congress of the revolution was ' a general or national government ; ' that it ' was organized under the auspices and with the consent of the people , acting directly in their primary , sovereign capacity , and without the intervention of the functionaries to whom the ordinary powers of government were delegated in the colonies . ' He acknowledges that the powers of this congress were but illdefined ; that many of them were exercised by mere usurpation , and were acquiesced in by the people , only from the confidence reposed in the wisdom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper opportunity , during the pressure of the war , to raise nice questions of the powers of government . And yet he infers , from the exercise of powers thus ill-defined , and in great part , usurped , that ' from the moment of the declaration of independence , if not for most purposes , at an antecedent pe- /z/ riod , the united colonies must be considered as being a nation de facto , ' &c.; " A very slight attention to the history of the times will place this subject in its true light . The colonies complained of oppressions from the mother country , and were anxious to devise some means by which their grievances might be redressed . These grievances were common to all of them ; for England made no discrimination between them , in the general course of her colonial policy . Their rights , as British subjects , had never been well defined ; and some of the most important of those rights , as asserted by themselves , had been denied by the British crown . As early as 1765 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or convention , in New York , for the purpose of deliberating on these grave matters of common concern ; and they then made a formal declaration of what they considered their rights , as colonists and British subjects . This measure , however , led to no redress of their grievances . On the contrary , the subsequent measures of the British government gave new and just causes of complaint ; so that , in 1774 , it was deemed necessary that the colonies should again meet together , in order to consult upon their general condition , and provide for the safety of their common rights . Hence the congress which met at Carpenter 's hall , in Philadelphia , on the 5th of September 1774 . It consisted of delegates from New Hampshire , Massachusetts Bay , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , Connecticut , from the city and county of N etc York , and other counties in the in ovine e of New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Newcastle , Kent and StisseJ in Delaware , Maryland , Virginia and South Carolina . North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia not at all . It is also apparent , that New York was not represented as a colony , but only through certain portions of her people ; ( / ) in like manner , Lyman Hall ( i ) The historical fact here stated , is perfectly authenticated , and has never been disputed ; nevertheless , the following extracts from the journals of congress , may not be out of place : " Wednesday , September 14 , 1774 . Henry Wisner , a delegate from the county of Orange , in the colony of New York , appeared at congress , and produced a certificate of his election by the said county , which being read and approved , he took his scat in congress as a deputy from the colony of New York .

In point of fact , the congress was a deliberative and advisory body , and nothing more ; and , for this reason , it was not deemed important , or , at least , not indispensable , that all the colonies should be represented , since the resolutions of congress had no obligatory force whatever . It was appointed for the sole purpose of taking into consideration the general condition of the colonies , and of devising and recommending proper measures , for the security of their rights and interests . For these objects no precise powers and instructions were necessary , and beyond them none were given . Neither does it appear that any precise time was assigned for the duration of congress . The duty with which it was charged was extremely simple ; and it was taken for granted that it would dissolve itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Monday , September 26 , 1774 .

Simon Bocrum , Esq. , appeared in congress as a deputy from King 's county , in the colony of New York , and produced the credentials of his election , which being read and approved , he took his seat as a delegate from that colony . " It is evident from these extracts , that although the delegates from certain portions of the people of New York were admitted to seats in congress as delegates from the colony , yet , in point of fact , they were not elected as such , neither were they ever recognized as such , by New York herself . The truth is , as will presently appear , the majority of her people were not ripe for the measures pursued by congress , and would not have agreed to appoint delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the credentials of the congress of 1774 will shew , beyond all doubt , the true character of that assembly .

" The above extracts are made from the credentials of the deputies of the several colonies , as spread upon the journal of congress , according to a copy of that journal bound ( as appears by a gilt label on the back thereof ) for the use of the president of congress ; now in possession of B. Tucker esq . It is perfectly clear from these extracts , 1 . That the colonies did not consider themselves as " one people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston as their own ; but that they made common cause with Massachusetts , only because the principles asserted in regard to her , equally affected the other colonies . 2 . That each colony appointed its own delegates , giving them precisely such power and authority as suited its own views . 3 . That no colony gave any power or authority except for advisement only . 4 . That so far from designing to establish " a general or national government , " and to form themselves into " a nation de facto , " their great purpose was to bring about a reconciliation and harmony with the mother country . This is still farther apparent from the tone of the public addresses of congress . 5 . That this congress was not " organized under the auspices and with the consent of the people , acting directly in their primary , sovereign capacity , and without the intervention of the functionaries to whom the ordinary powers of government were delegated in the /z/ not independent , and had not even resolved to declare themselves so at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirous to preserve and continue their connexion with the parent country , and congress was charged with the duty of devising such measures as would enable them to do so , without involving a surrender of their rights as British subjects . It is equally clear , that the powers with which congress was clothed , did not flow from , nor constitute ' one people , ' or ' nation de facto , ' and that that body was not ' a general or national government , ' nor a government of any kind whatever . The existence of such government was absolutely inconsistent with the allegiance which the colonies still acknowledged to the British crown . Our author himself informs us , in a passage already quoted , that they had no power to form such government , nor to enter into ' any league or treaty among themselves . ' Indeed , congress did not claim any legislative power whatever , nor could it have done so consistently witli the political relations which the colonies still acknowledged and desired to preserve . Its acts were in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it recommended to its constituents whatever it believed to be for their advantage , but it commanded nothing . Each colony , and the people thereof , were at perfect liberty to act upon such recommendation or not , as they might think proper . ( I ) colonies , " but , on the contrary , that it was organized by the colonics as such , and generally through their ordinary legislatures ; and always with careful regard to their separate and independent rights and powers . If the congress of 1771 was " a general or national governvernment , " neither New York nor Georgia was a party it ; for neither of them was represented in that congress . It is also worthy of remark that the congress of 1774 had no agents of its own in foreign countries , but employed these of the several colonies . See the resolution for delivering the address to the king , passed October 25 , 1774 , and the letter to the agents , approved on the following da T . ( / ) The journals of congress afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to shew the general character of their proceedings , it is enough for me to refer to the following : On the 11th October 1771 , il was " Resolved unanimously , That a memorial be prepared to the people of British America , stating to them the necessity of a firm , united and invariable ob /z/ " On the 22d October 1774 , this congress dissolved itself , having recommended to the several colonies to appoint delegates to another congress , to be held in Philadelphia in the following May . Accordingly delegates were chosen , as they had been chosen to the preceding congress , each colony and the people thereof acting for themselves , and by themselves ; and the delegates thus chosen were clothed with substantially the same powers , for precisely the same objects , as in the former congress . Indeed , it could not have been otherwise ; for the relations of the colonies were still unchanged , and any measure establishing ' a general or national government , ' or uniting the colonies so as to constitute them ' a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open rebellion , and would have servation of the measures recommended by the congress , as they tender the invaluable rights and liberties derived to them from the laws and constitution of their country . " The memorial was accordingly prepared , in conformity with the resolution . Congress having previously had under consideration the plan of an association for establishing non-importation &c.; finally adopted it , October 20 , 1774 . After reciting their grievances , they say , " And , therefore , we do , for ourselves and the inhabitants of the several colonies whom we represent , firmly agree and associate , under the sacred ties of virtue , honour and love of our country , as follows . " They then proceed to recommend a certain course of proceeding , such as non-importation and non-consumption of certain British productions . They recommend the appointment of a committee in every county , city and town , to watch their fellowcitizens , in order to ascertain whether or not " any person within the limits of their appointment has violated this association ; " and if they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " to the end , that all such foes to the rights of British America may be publicly known , and universally contemned as the enemies of American liberty ; and , thenceforth , ice respectively xcili break off all dealings with him or her . " They also resolve that they will " have no trade , commerce , dealings or intercourse whatsoever , with any colony or province in North America , which shall not accede to , or which shall hereafter violate this association , but will hold them as unworthy of the rights of freemen , and as inimical to the liberties of their country . " This looks very little like the legislation of the " general or national government " of " a nation de facto . " The most important measures of general concern are rested upon no stronger foundation than " the sacred ties of virtue , honour , and the love of our country , " and have no higher sanction than public contempt and exclusion from the ordinary intercourse of society ! /z/ severed at once all the ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were still anxious to preserve . New York was represented in this congress precisely as she had been in the former one , that is , by delegates chosen by a part of her people ; for the royal party was so strong in that colony , that it would have been impossible to obtain from the legislature an expression of approbation of any measure of resistance to British authority . The accession of Georgia to the general association was not made known till the 20th of July , and her delegates did not take their seats till the 13th of September . In the mean time congress had proceeded in the discharge of its duties , and some of its most important acts , and among the rest , the appointment of a commander-in-chief of their armies , were performed while those two colonies were unrepresented . Its acts , like those of the former congress , were in the form of resolution and recommendation ; for , as it still held out the hope of reconciliation with the parent country , it did not venture to assume the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude and to act in this mode till the 4th of July 1776 , when it declared that the colonies there represented ( including New York , which had acceded after the battle of Lexington ) were , and of right ought to be , free and independent states . ( w ) ( m ) That the powers granted to the delegates to the second congress were substantially the same with those granted to the delegates to the first , will appear from the following extracts from their credentials : New Hampshire . " To consent and agree to all measures which said congress shall deem necessary to obtain redress of American grievances . " Delegates appointed by a convention . Massachusetts . " To concert , agree upon , direct and order " ( in concert with the delegates of the other colonies ) " such further measures as to them shall appear to be best calculated for the recovery and establishment of American rights and liberties , and for restoring harmony between Great Britain and the colonies .

Strictly speaking , they had no authority to make that decity and county of New York , the city and county of Albany , and the counties of Dutchess , Ulster , Orange , West Chester , King 's , and Suffolk . They gave their delegates power to " concert and determine upon such measures as shall be judged most effectual for the preservation and re-establishment of American rights and privileges , and for the restoration of harmony between Great Britain and the colonies .

" Delegates appointed by provincial congress . In the copy of the journals of congress now before me , I do not find the credentials of the delegates from B-hode Island . They did not attend at the first meeting of congress , although they did at a subsequent period . Georgia was not represented in this congress until September 1775 . On the 13th May 1775 , Lyman Hall appeared as a delegate from the parisli of St. John 's , and he was admitted to his seat , " subject to such regulations , as the congress shall determine , relative to his voting . " He was never regarded as the representative of Georgia , nor was that colony then considered as a party to the proceedings of congress . This is evident from /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but precisely the reverse ; and although some of them were expressly authorized to agree to it , yet others were not . Indeed , we are informed by Mr. Jefferson , that the declaration was opposed by some of the firmest patriots of the body , and among the rest , by R. R. Livingston , Dickenson , Wilson and E. Rutledge , on the ground that it was premature ; that the people of New York , New Jersey , Maryland and Delaware , were not yet ripe for it , but would soon unite with the rest , if not indiscreetly urged . In venturing upon so bold a step , congress acted precisely as they did in all other cases , in the name of the states whose representatives they were , and with a full reliance that those states would confirm whatever they might do for the general good . They were , strictly , agents or ministers of independent states , acting each under the authority and instructions of his own state , and having no power whatever , except what those instructions conferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of congress , except so far as they respectively authorized their own delegates to bind them . There was no original grant of powers to that body , except for deliberation and advisement ; there was no constitution , no law , no agreement , to which they could refer , in order to ascertain the extent of their powers . The members did not all act under the same instructions , nor with the same extent of au- the fact that , in the address to the inhabitants of Great Britain , they use the style , " The twelve United Colonies , by their delegates in congress , to the inhabitants of Great Britain , " adopted on the 8th July 1775 . On the 20th of that month , congress were notified that a convention of Georgia had appointed delegates to attend them , but none of them took their seats till the Kith of September following . They were authorized u to do , transact , join , and concur with the several delegates from the other colonies and provinces upon this continent , on all such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this alarming time , for the preservation and defence of our rights and liberties , and for the restoration of harmony , upon constitutional principles , between Great Britain and America . " Some of the colonies appointed their delegates only for limited times , at the expiration of which , they were replaced by others , but without any material change in their powers . The delegates were , in all things , subject to the orders of their respective colo-nies. /z/ thority . The different states gave different instructions , each according to its own views of right and policy , and without reference to any general scheme to which they were all bound to conform . Congress had in fact no power of government at all , nor had it that character of permanency which is implied in the idea of government . It could not pass an obligatory law , nor devise an obligatory sanction , by virtue of any inherent power in itself . It was , as already remarked , precisely the same body after the declaration of independence as before . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any new and valid relations between the colonies , so long as they acknowledged themselves dependencies of the British crown , they certainly could not do so after the declaration of independence , without some new grant of power . The dependent colonies had then become independent states ; their political condition and relations were necessarily changed by that circumstance ; the deliberative and advisory body , through whom they had consulted together as colonies , was functus officio ; the authority which appointed them had ceased to exist , or was superseded by a higher authority . Every thing which they did , after this period , and before the articles of confederation , was without any other right or authority than what was derived from the mere consent and acquiescence of the several states . In the ordinary business of that government de facto , which the occasion had called into existence , they did whatever the public interest seemed to require , upon the secure reliance that their acts would be approved and confirmed .

Indeed , as they were called into existence by the colonies in 1775 , and as they continued in existence without any new election or new grant of power , it is difficult to perceive how they could form ' a general or national government , organized by the people . ' They were elected by subjects of the king of England ; subjects who had no right , as they themselves admitted , to establish any government whatever ; and when those subjects became citizens of independent states , they gave no instructions to establish any such government . The government ezer-/z/ cised was , as already remarked , merely a government de facto , and no farther de jure than the subsequent approval of its acts by the several states made it so . " This brief review will enable us to determine how far the author is supported in the inferences he has drawn , in the passages last quoted . We have reason to regret that in these , as in many others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating his proposition or in citing his proof . To what people does he allude , when he tells us that the ' first general or national government ' was organized ' by the people ? ' The first and every recommendation to send deputies to a general congress was addressed to the colonies as such ; in the choice of those deputies each colony acted for itself , without mingling in any way with the people or government of any other colony ; and when the deputies met in congress , they voted on all questions of public and general concern by colonies , each colony having one vote , whatever was its population or number of deputies . If , then , this government was organized by ' the people ' at all , it was clearly the people of the several colonies , and not the joint people of all the colonies . And where is the author 's warrant for the assertion , that they acted ' directly in their primary sovereign capacity , and without the intervention of the functionaries , to whom the ordinary powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in most respects a close follower of Marshall , and he could scarcely have failed to see the following passage , which is found in a note in the 168th page of the second volume of the Life of Washington . Speaking of the congress of 1774 , Marshall says : - The members of this congress were generally elected by the authority of the colonial legislatures , but in some instances a different system had been pursued . In New Jersey and Maryland the elections were made by committees chosen in the several counties for that particular purpose ; and in New York , where the royal party was very strong , and where it is probable that no legislative act , authorizing an election of members to represent that colony in congress , could have been obtained , the people themselves assembled in those places , where the spirit of opposition to the claims of parliament prevailed , and elected deputies , who were readily received into congress . ' Here the general rule is stated to /z/ be , that the deputies were elected by the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people acted ' directly in their primary sovereign capacity , without the intervention of the ordinary functionaries of government , ' are given as exceptions . And even in those cases , in which delegates were appointed by conventions of the people , it was deemed necessary in many instances , as we have already seen , that the appointment should be approved and confirmed by the ordinary legislature . As to New York , neither her people nor her government had so far lost their attachment to the mother country as to concur in any measure of opposition until after the battle of Lexington , in April 1775 ; and the only representatives which New York had in the congress of 1774 were those of a comparatively small portion of her people . It is well known  - -  and , indeed , the author himself so informs us  --  that the members of the congress of 1775 were elected substantially as were those of the preceding congress ; so that there were very few of the colonies , in which the people performed that act in their ' primary sovereign capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is of little consequence , however , to the present enquiry , whether the deputies were chosen by the colonial legislatures , as was done in most of the colonies , or by conventions , as was done in Georgia and some others , or by committees appointed for the purpose , as was done in one or two instances , or by the people in primary assemblies , as was done in part of New York . All these modes were resorted to , according as the one or the other appeared most convenient or proper in each particular case . But , whichever mode was adopted , the members were chosen by each colony in and for itself , and were the representatives of that colony alone , and not of any other colony , or any nation de facto or de jure . The assertion , therefore , that ' the congress thus assembled exercised de facto and de jure a sovereign authority , not as the delegated agents of the governments de facto of the colonies , but in virtue of original powers derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , very bold , in one who had undoubtedly explored all the sources of information upon the subject . Until the adoption of the articles of confederation congress had no ' original powers , ' except only for deliberation and advise- /z/ ment , and claimed no ' sovereign authority ' whatever . It was an occasional , and not a permanent body , or one renewable from time to time . Although they did , in many instances , ' exercise de facto ' a power of legislation to a certain extent , yet they never held that power ' de jure , ' by any grant from the colonies or the people ; and their acts became valid only by subsequent confirmation of them , and not because they had any delegated authority to perform them . The whole history of the period proves this , and not a single instance can be cited to the contrary . The course of the revolutionary government throughout attests the fact , that , however the people may have occasionally acted , in pressing emergencies , without the intervention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the fact that they were citizens of separate colonies , and never , even impliedly , surrendered that character , or acknowledged a different allegiance . In all the acts of congress , reference was had to the colonies , and never to the people . That body had no power to act directly upon the people , and could not execute its own resolves as to most purposes , except by the aid and intervention of the colonial authorities . Its measures were adopted by the votes of the colonies as such , and not by the rule of mere numerical majority , which prevails in every legislative assembly of an entire nation . This fact alone is decisive to prove , that the members were not the representatives of the people of cdl the colonies , for the judgment of each colony was pronounced by its own members only , and no others had any right to mingle in their deliberations . What , then , was this ' sovereign authority ? ' What was the nature , what the extent , of its ' original powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived ? I look in vain for answers to these questions to any historical record which has yet met my view , and have only to regret that the author has not directed me to better guides . - ' The author 's conclusion is not . better sustained by the nature and extent of the powers exercised by the revolutionary government . It has already been stated , that no original powers of legislation were granted to the congresses of 1774 and 1775 ; and it is only from their acts that we can determine what powers they actually exercised . The circumstances under which thev were called CONSTITUTIONAL LAW . o9 into existence precluded the possibility of any precise limitations of their powers , even if it had been designed to clothe them with the functions of government . The colonies were suffering under common oppressions , and were threatened with common dangers , from the mother country . The great object which they had in view was to produce that concert of action among themselves which would best enable them to resist their common enemy , and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must necessarily be reposed in public rulers under circumstances of this sort . We may well suppose , therefore , that the revolutionary government exercised every power which appeared to be necessary for the successful prosecution of the great contest in which they were engaged ; and we may , with equal propriety , suppose that neither the people nor the colonial governments felt any disposition to scrutinize very narrowly any measure which promised protection and safety to themselves . They knew that the government was temporary only ; that it was permitted only for a particular and temporary object , and that they could at any time recall any and every power which it had assumed . It would be a violent and forced inference , from the powers of such an agency , ( for it was not a government , although I have sometimes , for convenience , called it so , ) however great they might be , to say that the people , or states , which established it , meant thereby to merge their distinctive character , to surrender all the rights and privileges which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves into one nation . " In point of fact , however , there was nothing in the powers exercised by the revolutionary government , so far as they can be known from their acts , inconsistent with the perfect sovereignty and independence of the states . These were always admitted in terms , and were never denied in practice . So far as external relations were concerned , congress seems to have exercised every power of a supreme government . They assumed the right to ' declare war and to make peace ; to authorize captures ; to institute appellate prize courts ; to direct and control all national , military and naval operations ; to form alliances and make treaties ; to contract debts and issue bills of credit on national account . ' These powers were not ' exclusive , ' /z/ however , as our author supposes . On the contrary , troops were raised , vessels of wax-were commissioned , and various military operations Were conducted by the colonies , on their own separate means and authority . Ticonderoga was taken by the troops of Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out armed vessels to cruise against those of England , in October 1775 ; South Carolina soon followed their example . In 1776 , New Hampshire authorized her executive to issue letters of marque and reprisal . " These instances are selected out of many , as sufficient to shew that in the conduct of war congress possessed no ' exclusive ' power , and that the colonies ( or states ) retained , and actually asserted , their own sovereign right and power as to that matter . And not as to that matter alone , for New Hampshire established post offices . The words of our author may , indeed , import that the power of congress over the subject of war was * exclusive ' only as to such military and naval operations as he considers national , that is , such as were undertaken by the joint power of all the colonies ; and if so , he is correct . But the comma after the word ' national ' suggests a different interpretation . At all events , the facts which I have mentioned prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute sovereignty and independence of the states . " Many of those powers which , for greater convenience , were entrusted exclusively to congress , could not be effectually exerted except by the aid of the state authorities . The troops required by congress were raised by the states , and the commissions of their officers were countersigned by the governors of the states . Congress were allowed to issue bills of credit , but they could not make them a legal tender , nor punish the counterfeiter of them . Neither could they bind the states to redeem them , nor raise by their own authority the necessary funds for that purpose . Congress received ambassadors and other public ministers , yet they had no power to extend to them that protection which they receive from the government of every sovereign nation . A man by the name of De Longchamps entered the house of the French minister plenipotentiary in Philadelphia , and there threatened violence to the per- /z/ son of Francis Barbe Marbois , secretary of the French legation , consul general of France , and consul for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the public street . For this offence , he was indicted and tried in the court of over and terminer of Philadelphia , and punished under its sentence . The case turned chiefly upon the law of nations , with reference to the protection which it secures to foreign ministers . A question was made , whether the authorities of Pennsylvania should not deliver up De Longchamps to the French government to be dealt with at their pleasure . It does not appear that the federal government was considered to possess any power over the subject , or that it was deemed proper to invoke its counsel or authority in any form . This case occurred in 1784 , after the adoption of the articles of confederation ; but if the powers of the federal government were less under those articles than before , it only proves that , however great its previous powers may have been , they were held at the will of the states , and were actually recalled by the articles of confederation . Thus it appears that , in the important functions of raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying public debts , and giving security to the persons of foreign ministers , the boasted ' sovereignty ' of the federal government was merely nominal , and owed its entire efficiency to the co-operation and aid of the state governments . Congress had no power to coerce those governments ; nor could it exercise any direct authority over their individual citizens . " Although the powers actually assumed and exercised by congress were certainly very great , they were not always acquiesced in , or allowed , by the states . Thus , the power to lay an embargo was earnestly desired by them , but was denied by the states . And in order the more clearly to indicate that many of their powers were exercised merely by sufferance , and at the same time to lend a sanction to their authority so far as they chose to allow it , it was deemed necessary , by at least one of the states , to pass laws indemnifying those who might act in obedience to the resolutions of that body. ( w ) ( n ) This was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn . 3. /z/ " A conclusive proof , however , of the true relation which the colonies held to the revolutionary government , even in the opinion of congress itself , is furnished by their own journals . In June 1776 , that body recommended the passing of laws for the punishment of treason ; and they declare that the crime shall be considered as committed against the colonies individually , and not against them all , as united or confederated together . This could scarcely have been so , if they had considered themselves ' a government de facto and de jure , ' clothed with ' sovereign authority . ' The author , however , is not satisfied to rest his opinion upon historical facts ; he seeks also to fortify himself by a judicial decision . He informs us that , ' soon after the organization of the present government , the question of the powers of the continental congress was most elaborately discussed before the supreme court of the United States , in a case calling for an exposition of the appellate jurisdiction of congress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result of that examination was , that congress before the confederation possessed , by the consent of the people of the United States , sovereign and supreme powers for national purposes ; and , among others , the supreme powers of peace and war , and , as an incident , the right of entertaining appeals in the last resort , in prize causes , even in opposition to state legislation . And that the actual powers exercised by congress , in respect to national objects , furnished the best exposition of its constitutional authority , since they emanated from the people , and were acquiesced in by the people . ' " There is in this passage great want of accuracy , and perhaps some want of candour . The author , as usual , neglects to cite the judicial decision to which he alludes , but it must be the case of Pcnhallow and others against Doane 's administrators . ( 3 Dallas 's Reports 54 . ) Congress , in November 1775 , passed a resolution , recommending to the several colonies to establish prize courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1776 , New Hampshire accordingly passed a law upon the subject , by which an appeal to congress was allowed in cases of capture by vessels in the service of the united colonies ; but where the capture was made by ' a vessel in the service of the united colonies and of any particular colony or person /z/ together , the appeal was allowed to the superior court of New Hampshire . The brigantine Susanna was captured by a vessel owned and commanded by citizens of New Hampshire , and was duly condemned as prize by her own court of admiralty . An appeal was prayed to congress and denied ; and thereupon an appeal to the superior court of New Hampshire was prayed and allowed . From the decision of this court an appeal was taken to congress , in the mode prescribed by their resolution , and the case was disposed of by the court of appeals , appointed by congress to take cognizance of such cases . After the adoption of the present constitution and the organization of the judiciary system under it , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to carry into effect the sentence of the court of appeals above mentioned . The cause being legally transferred to the circuit court , was decided there , and an appeal allowed to the supreme court . That court , in its decision , sustains the jurisdiction of the court of appeals established by congress . Mr. justice Paterson 's opinion is founded mainly upon these grounds : That the powers actually exercised by congress ought to be considered as legitimate , because they were such as the occasion absolutely required , and were approved and acquiesced in by ' the people ; ' that the authority ultimately and finally to decide on all matters and questions touching the law of nations does reside and is vested in the sovereign supreme power of war and peace ; ' that this power was lodged in the continental congress by the consent and acquiescence of ' the people ; ' that the legality of all captures on the high seas must be determined by the law of nations : that New Hampshire had committed herself upon this subject by voting in favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the brig Active ; that as the commission , under which the capture in the case under consideration was made , was issued by congress , it resulted , of necessity , that the validity of all captures made by virtue of that commission should be judged of by congress , or its constituted authority , because ' every one must be amenable to the authority under which he acts . ' It is evident that this opinion , while it sustains the authority of congress in the particular case , does not prove its general supremacy , nor that the states had surrendered to it any part of their so- /z/ vereignty and independence . On the contrary , it affirms that the ' sovereign and supreme power of war and peace , ' was assumed by congress , and that the exercise of it became legitimate , only because it was approved and acquiesced in ; and that being thus legitimated , the appellate jurisdiction in prize cases followed as a necessary incident . All the powers , which Paterson contends for as exercised by congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree affecting the question before us ; they were as consistent with the character of a federative , as with that of a consolidated government . He does not tell us to what people he alludes , when he says that the powers exercised by congress were approved and ratified by ' the people . ' He does not , in any part of his opinion , authorize the idea of the author , that ' congress possessed , before the confederation , by the consent of the people of United States , sovereign and supreme powers for national purposes . ' On the contrary , as to one of these powers , he holds the opposite language ; and therefore it is fair to presume , that he intended to be so understood in regard to all the rest . This is his language : ' The authority exercised by congress , in granting commissions to privateers , was approved and ratified by the several colonies or states , because they received and filled up the commissions and bonds , and returned the latter to congress . ' This approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of this , and other similar powers assumed by congress , legitimate . " Judge Iredell , in delivering his opinion , goes much more fully into the examination of the powers of the revolutionary government . He thinks that , as the power of peace and war was entrusted to congress , they held , as a necessary incident , the power to establish prize courts ; and that whatever powers they did in fact exercise , were acquiesced in and consented to , and , consequently legitimated and confirmed . But he leaves no room to doubt as to the source whence this confirmation was derived . After proving that the several colonies were , to all intents and purposes , separate and distinct , and that they did not form 1 one people ' in any sense of the term , he says , ' If congress , previous to the articles of confederation , possessed any authority , it was an authority , as I have shewn , derived from the people of each province , in the first instance . ' /z/ ' The authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states . '  --  ' I conclude , therefore , that every particle of authority , which originally resided either in congress or in any branch of the state governments , was derived from the people who were permanent inhabitants of each province , in the first instance , and afterwards became citizens of each state ; that this authority was conveyed by each body politic separately , and not by all the people in the several provinces or states jointly . ' No language could be stronger than this , to disaffirm the author 's conclusion , that the powers exercised by congress were exercised ' by the consent of the people of the United States . ' Certainly Iredell did not think so . " The other two judges , Blair and Gushing , affirm the general propositions upon which Paterson and Iredell sustained the power of congress in the particular case , but lend no support to the idea of any such unity among the people of the several colonies or states , as our author supposes to have existed . Cushing , without formally discussing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sovereignty of the states . ' " This decision , then , merely affirms , what no one has ever thought of denying , that the revolutionary government exercised every power which the occasion required ; that , among these , the powers of peace and war were most important , because congress , alone , represented all the colonies , and could , alone , express the general will , and wield the general strength ; that wherever the powers of peace and war are lodged , belongs also the right to decide all questions touching the laws of nations ; that , prize causes are of this character ; and , finally , that all these powers were not derived from any original grant , but are to be considered as belonging to congress , merely because congress exercised them , and because they were sustained in so doing by the approbation of the several colonies or states , whose representatives they were . Surely , then , our author was neither very accurate nor very candid , in so stating this decision as to give rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme court , congress possessed original sovereign powers , by the consent of ' the people of the United States . ' Even , however , if the court had so decided , in express terms , it would have been of no value in the present enquiry , as will by-and-by be shewn. " /z/ We come next to the declaration of independence , and to the novel and original idea , that it did not operate the separate independence and individual sovereignty of the several states , but , that , as the declaration was the united act of all , so it operated to make the united colonies free and independent as one people , and in that character only . This , it is very clear , is the position industriously insinuated by the learned author , although , as usual , he is by no means very specific in stating his proposition , lest , perhaps , it might be the more startling from being more clearly discerned in its first announcement . " 211 . In the next place , " says judge Story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proclaim their own independence . It is true , that some of the states had previously formed incipient governments for themselves ; but it was done in compliance with the recommendations of congress . ( a ) Virginia , on the 29th of June 1776 , by a convention of delegates , declared ' the government of this country , as formerly exercised under the crown of Great Britain , totally dissolved ; ' and proceeded to form a new constitution of government . New Hampshire also formed a government , in December , 1775 , which was manifestly intended to be temporary , ' during ( as they said ) the unhappy and unnatural contest with Great Britain . ' ( b ) New Jersey , too , established a frame of government , on the 2d of July 1776 ; but it was expressly declared , that it should be void upon a reconciliation with Great Brirain. ( r ) And South Carolina , in March 1776 , adopted a constitution of government ; but this was , in like manner , ' established until an accommodation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal of Congress , 1775 , p. 115 , 231 , 235 , 279 ; 1 Pitk .

It was ' a declaration by the representatives of the United States of America in congress assembled ; '  --  ' by the delegates appointed by the good people of the colonies , ' as in a prior declaration of rights they were called . ( e ) It was not an act done by the state governments then organized ; nor by persons chosen by them . It was emphatically the act of the whole people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chosen for that , among other purposes . ( f ) It was an act not competent to the state governments , or any of them as organized under their charters , to adopt . Those charters neither contemplated the case , nor provided for it . It was an act of original , inherent sovereignty by the people themselves , resulting from their right to change the form of government , and to institute a new government , whenever necessary for their safety and happiness . So the declaration of independence treats it . No state had presumed of itself to form a new government , or to provide for the exigencies of the times , without consulting congress on the subject ; and when they acted , it was in pursuance of the recommendation of congress . It was , therefore , the achievement of the whole for the benefit of the whole . The people of the united colonies made the united colonies free and independent states , and absolved them from all allegiance to the British crown . The declaration of independence has accordingly always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complete and perfect per se , and ipso facto working an entire dissolution of all political connexion with and allegiance to Great Britain . And this not merely as a practical fact , but in a legal and constitutional view of the matter by courts of justice .

In that declaration the several states are not even enumerated ; but after reciting in nervous language , and with convincing arguments our right to independence , and the tyranny , which compelled us to assert it , the declaration is made in the following words : ' We , therefore , the representatives of the United States , &-c.; do , in the name , &,c.; of the good people of these colonies , solemnly publish , &c.; that these united colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent states .

The several states are not even mentioned by name in any part , as if it was intended to impress the maxim on America , that our freedom and independence arose from our union , and that without it we could never be free or independent .

" ( i ) ( i ) Debates in South Carolina , 1788 , printed by A. E. Miller , Charleston , 1831 , p. 43 , 44.  --  Mr. Adams , in his Oration on the 4th of July 1831 , which is valuable for its views of constitutional principles , insists upon the same doctrine at considerable length . Though it has been published since the original preparation of these lectures , I gladly avail myself of an opportunity to use his authority in corroboration of the same views . " The union of the colonies had preceded this declaration , of independence , and even the commencement of the war . The declaration was joint , that the united colonies were free and independent states , but not that any one of them was a free and independent state , separate from the rest . "  --  " The declaration of independence was a social compact , by which the whole people covenanted with each citizen , and each citizen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of right ought to be , free and independent states . To this compact union was as vital , as freedom or independence . "  --  " The declaration of independence announced the severance of the thirteen united colonies from the rest of the British empire , and the existence of their people from that day forth as an independent nation . The people of all the colonies , speaking by their representatives , constituted themselves one moral person before the face of their fellow men . "  --  " The declaration of independence was not a /z/ " In the next place we have seen , that the power to do this act was not derived from the state governments ; nor was it done generally with their co-operation . The question then naturally presents itself , if it is to be considered as a national act , in what manner did the colonies become a nation , and in what manner did congress become possessed of this national power ? The true answer must be , that as soon as congress assumed powers and passed measures , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , from whose acquiescence and consent they took effect , must be considered as agreeing to form a nation . ( k ) The congress of 1774 , looking at the general terms of the commissions , under which the delegates were appointed , seemed to have possessed the power of concerting such measures , as they deemed best , to redress the grievances , and preserve the rights and liberties of all the colonies . Their duties seem to have been principally of an advisory nature ; but the exigencies of the times led them rather to follow out the wishes and objects of their constituents , than scrupulously to examine the words , in which their authority was communicated . ( / ) The congress of 1775 and 1776 , were clothed with more ample powers , and the language of their commissions generally , was sufficiently broad to embrace the right to pass measures of a national character and obligation . The caution necessary at that period of the revolutionary struggle , rendered that language more guarded than the objects really in view would justify ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eagerly second every measure adopted to further a general union and resistance against the British claims . The congress of 1775 , accordingly assumed at once ( as we have seen ) the exercise of some of the highest functions of sovereignty . They took measures for national defence and resistance ; they followed up the prohibitions upon trade and intercourse with Great Bri- declaration of liberty merely acquired , nor was it a form of government . The people of the colonies were already free , and their forms of government were various . They were all colonies of a monarchy . The king of Great Britain was their common sovereign .

" 214 . The same body , in 1776 , took bolder steps , and exerted powers , which could in no other manner be justified or accounted for , than upon the supposition , that a national union for national purposes already existed , and that the congress was invested with sovereign power over all the colonies for the purpose of preserving the common rights and liberties of all . They accordingly authorized general hostilities against the persons and property of British subjects ; they opened an extensive commerce with foreign countries , regulating the . whole subject of imports and exports ; they authorized the formation of new governments in the colonies ; and , finally , they exercised the sovereign prerogative of dissolving the allegiance of all colonies to the British crown . The validity of these acts was never doubted or denied by the people . On the contrary , they became the foundation upon which the superstructure of the liberties and independence of the United States has been erected . Whatever , then , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is historically true , that before the declaration of independence , these colonies were not , in any absolute sense , sovereign states ; that that event did not find them or make them such , but that at the moment of their separation , they were under the dominion of a superior controlling national government , whose powers were vested in and exercised by the general congress with the consent of the people of all the states. ( m ) ( m ) This whole subject is very amply discussed by Mr. Dane in his Appendix to the 9th volume of his Abridgment of the Laws ; and many of his views coincide with those stated in the text . The whole of that Appendix is worthy of the perusal of every constitutional lawyer , even though he might differ from some of the conclusions of the learned author . He will there find much reasoning from documentary evidence of a public nature , which has not hitherto been presented in a condensed or accurate shape . /z/ 215 . From the moment of the declaration of independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the united colonies must be considered as being a nation de facto , having a general government over it created , and acting by the general consent of the people of all the colonies . The powers of that government were not , and indeed could not be well defined . But still its exclusive sovereignty , in many cases , was firmly established ; and its controlling power over the states was in most , if not in all national measures , universally admitted . ( ji ) The articles of confederation , of which we shall have occasion to speak more hereafter , were not prepared or adopted by congress until November 1777 , ( o ) they were not signed or ratified by any of the states until July 1778 ; and they were not ratified , so as to become obligatory upon all the states , until March 1781 . In the intermediate time , congress continued to exercise the powers of a general government , whose acts were binding on all the states . And though they constantly admitted the states to be ' sovereign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obvious , that the terms were used in the subordinate and limited sense already alluded to ; for it was impossible to use them in any other sense , since a majority of the states could , by their public acts in congress , control and bind the minority .

See , especially , pages 8 and 9 . When Mr. chief justice Marshall , in Ogden v. Gibbons , ( 9 Wheat . R. 187 , ) admits , that the states , before the formation of the constitution , were sovereign and independent , and were connected with each other only by a league , it is manifest , that he uses the word " sovereign " in a very restricted sense .

In respect to foreign governments , we were politically known as the United States only ; and it was in our national capacity , as such , that we sent and received ambassadors , entered into treaties and alliances , and were admitted into the general community of nations , who might exercise the right of belligerents , and claim an equality of sovereign powers and prerogatives. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be without use to refer to the opinions of some of our most eminent judges , delivered on occasions which required an exact examination of the subject . In Chisholm 's Executors v. The State of Georgia , ( 2 Dall. 419 , 470 , ) ( r ) Mr. chief justice Jay , who was equally distinguished as a revolutionary statesman and a general jurist , expressed himself to the following effect : ' The revolution , or rather the declaration of independence , found the people already united for general purposes , and at the same time providing for their more domestic concerns by state conventions and other temporary arrangements . From the crown of Great Britain , the sovereignty of their country passed to the people of it ; and it was then not an uncommon opinion , that the unappropriated lands , which belonged to that crown , passed , not to the people of the colony or states within whose limits they were situated , but to the whole people .

They accordingly grew into union , and formed one great political body , of which congress was the directing principle and soul , &c.; &,c.; The truth is , that the states , individually , were not known , nor recognized as sovereign by foreign nations , nor are they now . The states collectively , under congress , as their connecting point or head , were acknowledged by foreign powers , as sovereign , particularly in that acceptation of the term , which is applicable to all great national concerns , and in the exercise of which , other sovereigns would be more immediately interested . ' In Ware v. Hyltcn , ( 3 Dall. 199 , ) t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) said : ' It has been enquired , what powers congress possessed from the first meeting in September 1774 , until the ratification of the confederation on the first of March 1781 . It appears to me , that the powers of congress during that whole period were derived from the people they represented , expressly given through the medium of their state conventions or state legislatures ; or that after they were exercised , they were impliedly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people , &,c.; The powers of congress originated from necessity , and arose out of it , and were only limited by events ; or , in other words , they were revolutionary in their nature . Their extent depended on the exigencies and necessities of public affairs .

In respect to the powers ot the continental congress exercised before the adoption of the articles of confederation , few questions were judicially discussed during the revolutionary contest ; for men had not leisure in the heat of war , nicely to scrutinize or weigh such subjects ; inter arma silent leges . The people , relying on the wisdom and patriotism of congress , silently acquiesced in whatever authority they assumed .

And that the actual powers exercised by congress , in respect to national objects , furnished the best exposition of its constitutional authority , since they emanated from the representatives of the people , and were acquiesced in by the people .

Comm. 198 , 199. /z/ to misstate the positions of the author , and because I am well content to give to it all the benefit of that ability with which it is presented . I shall now proceed to remark very succinctly upon several passages which more particularly demand our scrutiny and observation . In a preceding passage , 201 , the learned author remarks : " Thus was organized under the auspices , and with the consent of the people , acting directly in their primary , sovereign capacity , and without the intervention of the functionaries to whom the ordinary powers of the government were delegated in the colonies , the first national government , which has been very aptly called the revolutionary government , since in its origin and progress it was wholly conducted upon revolutionary principles . " Now here , in the first place , we have a misstatement of the fact , as is manifest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that in some of the states where the legislatures were in session , delegates to the congress of 1774 were appointed " by them ; that is , by the functionaries to whom the ordinary powers of the government were entrusted . " So that this congress was composed of members chosen indifferently in the several states , cither by the legislatures or conventions , as each state thought proper ; a fact going far to establish the independent sovereign action of each state , in appointing those who were to represent them in this great congress of nations . But in the second place , it would have made no difference as to the matter in question , whether all or none of the states had made the appointment by conventions , instead of by the ordinary functionaries of government . For the question here is , whether this appointment of delegates was state action , or the action of the great body of the American people composing oik nation . Now , whether the appointments were made by legislatures or conventions , they were equally the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w ) " A distinction has been taken at the bar , " says judge Iredell , " between a. state , and the peopli of a *tn/r . It is a distinction 1 am not capable of comprebrnding . By a state forming a republic ( speaking of it as a moral person , ) I do not mum the legislature of the state , the executive or the judiciary , but all the citizens which coinposc that state , and arc , if I may so express myself , integral parts of it , all together forming a body politic . " Of course he- /z/ no more represented the individual state than the convention . The convention in each state was the representative of that state , quoad the matter on which it acted . It represented no other state . It was amenable to none other . It was itself the impersonation of that sovereignty . It was appointed indeed " by the people acting in their primary , sovereign capacity , " but yet as separate communities , and not as forming one great whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not beyond them . Accordingly , their delegates looked only to them ; obeyed them alone ; submitted to their instructions , and were removable by them : all which demonstrably proves that the conventions of the states were as distinct from each other as the " ordinary functionaries , " and that the acts of each was in behalf and by authority of its own state , as a distinct sovereign , and not in right of any other part of the confederated states , or of the whole people of America as constituting one people . In accordance with this character , each delegation voted together , and the majority of the delegation determined the vote of the state . Each state had but one vote , whether large or small , and thus , in these important features , the congress assumed the character of an assembly of ambassadors , rather than that of the legislature of a single nation . Such was the character of that body which declared independence ; a body composed of delegates from separate political societies , who had only united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severance of the chain that bound them to a common tyrant , without an act indicating a design on the part of any , to surrender their separate political character . Thus acting , they declared independence . In that declaration the representatives of the several colonies pronounced that the United Colonies were and of right ought to be free and independent states , not that they constituted a free and independent state . Then plurality is acknowledged and asserted by the declaration itself , and that plurality is decisive of the fact , that the independence of the states themselves , as several political bodies , was distinctly asserted . It is not true then that ther the action be by a legislature or convention , it is the same thing , since neither constitutes the state , but on the other hand either represents it . /z/ the states did " not severally act for themselves ; " for the delegates of each , in congress assembled , acted for their respective states , though in conjunction , it is true , with the delegates from other states acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty of peace was made , each state is distinctly named in the treaty , and the independence of all is as distinctly acknowledged . But this is not all . Before the declaration of July 4 , the commonwealth of Virginia had formed a government for herself . Not an incipient government , as our author says , but a permanent and independent one , which lasted until changed by her own Ji at in the year 1S32 . This creation of an independent government by the state of Virginia , ipso facto constituted her an independent state , and according to the notion of Mr. Jay , ( x ) the sovereignty over the state must instantly have passed from the crown of Great Britain to the people of the state . It could not pass to the people of the United States , for there were none such , since they had not yet declared independence . The first steps towards establishing the government of Virginia were taken on the 6th day of May , and the act was consummated on the 29th of June 1776 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free will , and not by command , or even by the recommendation of congress . Congress , before the declaration , recommended only provisional governments , like that of New Hampshire , to continue " during the unhappy and unnatural contest with Great Britain . " They could not , with any consistency , recommend the erection of a permanent government by any state , before they had themselves resolved on a declaration of independence ; about which , it is notorious there was much division of opinion . But the new government of Virginia was permanent , and cut her loose from Great Britain . It is therefore gratuitous in judge Story to say that " no state had presumed of itself to form a new government without consulting congress on the subject ; " for Virginia did form such a government without congressional recommendation , and did " declare the former government under Great Britain totally dissolved , " before the congress of the United States had resolved on independence . From ( x ) See note , p. 49. /z/ that moment , as judge Chase very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia was a free , sovereign and independent state . " Nay , this learned judge goes farther , and expressly says of the declaration of independence itself , that " he considered it as a declaration not that the United Colonies jointly in a collective capacity were independent states , but that each of them was a sovereign and independent state ; that is , that each of them had a right to govern itself by its own authority and its own laws , without any control from any other power upon earth . " ( y ) But our learned author seems to conceive that he settles the question by saying , that " the declaration was the united act of all ; "  --  " that it was the act of the whole people of the United Colonies , exercising original inherent sovereignty , resulting from their right to change the form of government , " &c.; But the question is , in what character was it the united act of all 1 It was in their character of separate communities , dependent on each other only so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them so . It was the act , indeed , of all America ; but not as forming one nation , but as separate communities , all uniting in the common object of securing sovereignty and independence to each . How did they vote ? Not by individuals , as representing parts of one whole , but by states , as representing separate communities . If any one state had refused to concur in the declaration , the vote of all the rest could not have bound her . Delaware could no more have been included if she had declined to assent , than Canada or Vermont , who did not send delegates to the body . It was then the joint act , indeed , of the United Colonies , but it was the joint act of communities independent of each other , and uniting in one common measure for the benefit of each . And this seems to have been the understanding of those who had themselves been actors in the stirring scenes of the revolution . It is distinctly avowed in the Federalist , ( p. 213 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years after the close of the war , and came from the hands of some of our wisest and purest pa- ( ? / ) The case of Vermont was peculiar . She had no representative in the congress which declared independence , though she joined her arms with ours . She declared her own independence in 1777. /z/ triots , least liable to be biassed in favour of the sovereignty of the states . One of its authors , too , at a future day , from the elevated station of the supreme court , distinctly declared , " that by the declaration of independence thirteen sovereignties were considered as emerged from the principles of the revolution ; " so that reason and authority concur in rejecting the conclusions of our author . It is to be regretted that in a work intended for the instruction of our youth , any passage should occur which is calculated to mislead , or may be regarded as a sophism . An instance , however , is found in that which Ave have been examining . Our author says , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state governments , as organized under their charter s , to adopt . " ( p. 198 . ) This is , indeed , undeniable . Their charters did not authorize them to adopt such a measure ; but what was there to prevent the " original inherent sovereignty of the people " themselves in each ztate from such adoption . It was the right of revolution which belonged to each of the separate communities , as much as to the whole , and which each might assert independent of the others . It was this right of each , which , in general congress , was asserted by the whole , for the benefit of each , and in that sense only for the benefit of the whole . With these views , I look upon the positions of judge Story , and the ipse dixits of Mr. Pinckney and Mr. Adams , on whose authority he relies , as heretical and false , as I am equally well assured they are dangerous and pernicious . If , indeed , there could be any doubt that thirteen independent communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt would be removed , by the manner in which the states themselves , looked upon their position . Their view of the matter is distinctly disclosed in the articles of confederation . Those articles profess to be between the states of New Hampshire , Massachusetts , &,c.; naming each state in the confederacy . They profess to be articles of confederation , ( a term only applicable to an association of states ) and perpetual union , which implies an anterior state in which there was no such union . And such was the fact ; for until that confederation , the congress of the United States constituted only a revolutionary government , not regularly organized , but ex- /z/ isting by tacit consent and acquiescence of the several states , who coalesced and acted in concert from a sense of common danger . There was between them no express agreement . The confederation was , therefore , intended to bind together the states , who were , till then , unbound ; and to unite those who had never before been united , but by the bond of common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to retain that which to every nation is sweet  --  its sovereignty and independence . The style of the confederacy was the United States of America , a name which very plainly indicates the union of political bodies , and not the oneness of a single republic . But to place the matter beyond question , the second section is devoted to the declaration " that each state retains its sovereignty , freedom and independence , and every power , jurisdiction and right , which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States in congress assembled . " They not only declare , that thenceforth each state shall be held to be sovereign and independent , but they avow their anterior independence and sovereignty , by the declaration that they retained them . They could not retain that which they had not before enjoyed . Nay , more ;  --  each state in making this declaration , uno flatu , asserts its own rights , and recognizes the rights of others . Each , therefore , recognized the anterior sovereignty and independence of every other . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no where , ( so far as I can discover ) in the examination of the question of the independence of the states , thought fit to present us with his views of the effect of these articles in throwing light upon the matter . Had he done so , we may hope that he would never have arrived at the conclusion which he gives in the language of Mr. Pinckney , that " the separate independence and individual sovereignty of the several states were never thought of by the enlightened band of patriots who framed the declaration . " Now it happens that Hancock , Adams and Gerry from Massachusetts , Ellery from Rhode Island , Sherman , Huntingdon and Wolcott from Connecticut , Lewis from New York , Witherspoon from Jersey , Robert Morris from Pennsylvania , Thomas M'Kean from Delaware , Carroll from Maryland , the two Lees from Virginia , Penn from North Caro- /z/ lina , and Hayward from South Carolina , who signed the declaration of independence , were signers of the confederation in which the sovereignty of each was declared to be retained ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another signer of the declaration , of his views of the same interesting matter . I feel myself , therefore , justified in repelling the position , that " the separate independence and individual sovereignty of the several states , were never thought of by the patriot signers of the declaration of independence . It is also to be regretted that , the able commentator , in citing judicial opinions in confirmation of his views , has given us , among others , the portion of judge Chase 's opinion in Ware v. Hylton , 3 Dall. p. 231 , which is least at variance with his own theories , and has omitted to present to the student the strong remarks of that able judge in conflict with his own views . In these , as we have already seen , he declares , that he considers the declaration of independence ( which he himself had signed , ) " as a declaration not that the United States jointly , in a collectivi capacity , were independent states , but that each or them was a sovereign and independent state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to his readers to have learned , that Mr. Marshall ( afterwards chief justice ) , was of counsel in that cause , and strenuously maintained the independence and sovereignty of Virginia in 1777 : a position in irreconcilable conflict with the opinions of the commentator . /z/ From what has been advanced , I hope the separate sovereignties of the states upon the adoption of the declaration of independence , is sufficiently apparent . I have devoted more time to these investigations , because the opposite opinion has been so industriously maintained by an able writer , obviously with the view of influencing certain great political questions which have arisen under our constitution . If , indeed , judge Story means nothing more than that the revolutionary congress , both before and after the declaration of independence , exercised large powers by the acquiescence and consent of the states , in relation to national concerns , there could be no difference between us . The matter of fact is beyond question . But judge Story seems to be of opinion that the states were not sovereign during this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that the people were one. ( a ) Those on the other hand who maintain the rights of the states , regard the sovereignty as having existed and continued in the states , though the exercise of certain powers in relation to foreign concerns was permitted by them on the part of congress . But this very permission , this acquiescence and tacit consent so frequently spoken of by the commentator , is itself decisive of state supremacy . Congress had no power but by state acquiescence . In whom then was the sovereignty ? In those assuredly who gave the authority to the general government , and without whose assent that authority could not exist . Such is the case in every league , where powers are vested in a general council , for the conduct of the foreign aifairs of the associated nations . Such was the case in our own confederacy , in which , as we have seen , very large powers were given , but the " freedom , sovereignty and independence " of ( a ) He quotes too , with apparent acquiescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have been hoped would have found no place save in his own pages . Judge Story has transplanted them into his . They are hereafter adverted to . /z/ the states were scrupulously reserved , and congress was confined to the powers expressly granted by the articles of confederation . From the moment of the adoption of that compact , at least , the sovereignty of the states must be admitted , as each expressly asserted its own , while it as clearly acknowledged the independence of others . They treated too , with other nations , in the character of a confederacy of states , and not in that of a single nation . Accordingly , in the treaty of peace , his Britannic majesty acknowledges " the United States , viz : New Hampshire , Massachusetts , " &c.; naming them each individually " to be free , sovereign and independent states ; that he treats with them as such , and for himself relinquishes , " &,c.; So too the compact itself admits the distinct anterior sovereignty of each state in this , that though ratified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth ; whereas , if as judge Story observes , " congress was invested with sovereign power over all the colonies , for the purpose of preserving the rights and liberties of all , " ( page 202 , ) what hindered a majority of that body from binding every state to enter into the confederacy , whether they approved it or not ? What would have hindered the abolition of the stite governments , and the substitution of one general government for all purposes whatever . Yet such sweeping powers were never dreamed of , since in fact the congress was the creature of the states , and existed by their sufferance . Its powers were limited , and limited by those who gave them . They therefore were the masters ; they were the sovereigns , while the general government could exercise no authority but that which they had expressly given . Its act was their act , and derived its- force from them , and the sovereign power which it exercised was their sovereign power . While it possessed those powers , it was , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were respectively sovereign as to all powers not granted . As it has been well expressed by judge Iredell , ( 2 Dall. 435 , ) in relation to the present constitution , " Every state in the Union , in every instance where its sovereignty has not been delegated to the United States , I consider to be as completely sovereign as the United States are in relation to the powers surrendered . The United States are sovereign as to all the powers of government actually surrendered ; each state in the Union /z/ is sovereign as to all the powers reserved ; the part not surrendered must remain as it was before . " In strictness , according to the theory of our government , the people are the sovereign . And they have delegated a part of their power to the general government , and part to the state governments , and each exercise the respective portions of the sovereign powers allotted to them . Each may in this sense be said to be sovereign , though the sovereignty in fact still resides in the people . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other states , and the people of each state accordingly delegates the power . For as there is no people of the United States , considered aggregately , the sovereignty must be in the people of each state . " I conclude , " says judge Iredell , " that every particle of authority which originally resided either in congress , or in any branch of the state governments , was derived from the people , who were permanent inhabitants of each province in the first instance , and afterwards became citizens of each state ; that this authority was conveyed by each body politic separately , and not by all the people in the several provinces or states , jointly , and of course that no authority could be conveyed to the whole , but that which previously was possessed by the several parts , " &,c.; We now come to the consideration of the condition of the states under the articles of confederation , ( b ) and here we shall find that however successful the commentator may have been in insinuating doubts of their sovereignty before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty beyond all question . I shall present the different evidences of it as succinctly as possible , as they are so numerous that to expatiate on each would unnecessarily consume our time . 1 . And first let it be remarked that the articles are declared to be articles of confederation ; a term which in its ordinary as well as in its radical signification , implies a league or union between states , as contradistinguished from a national government over one people . 2 . They are declared to be articles of confederation between the states of New Hampshire , &c,; naming each , thus recognizing each as a state , and as such capable of ( ft ) See the articles , 1 L. U. S. 13. /z/ contracting with other states , which is one of the highest attributes of sovereignty . 3 . They are declared also to be articles of perpetual union ; an expression which strongly negatives the favourite notion of oneness , since union implies the connection of those who before were separate . 4 . The act of uniting is styled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship for common defence , &lc,; binding themselves to assist each other , and thus distinctly recognizing their separateness and independence of each other . 5 . The confederacy is styled " The United States of America , " still keeping in view the fact of its component parts being different bodies politic. 6 . The second article declares that each state retains its sovereignty , freedom and independence , and all powers not expressly granted ; thus asserting anterior sovereignty in each , and conceding it to every other . 7 . Various provisions shew that the parties kept in view , throughout , the distinctness of their several communities , and their attributes of sovereignty ; thus 8 . " The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse between the people of the different states in this Union , it is provided , that the free inhabitants of each shall be entitled to all the privileges of citizens in the several states ; " a provision utterly unnecessary , if they formed but one people . 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into treaties , engaging in war , or keeping troops or navies ; thus clearly admitting , that but for this restriction , every state would possess these important attributes of sovereignty . 10 . In assenting to the articles of confederation , the states acted independently of each other , and the legislatures of the several states , through their delegates , declared their respective assents. 11 . No state was held bound which did not expressly assent , and no change was to be made in the articles at any time without the consent of every state . 12 . The congress under this confederation was composed of delegates not elected by the people , but by the legislatures in each state . /z/ 13 . Those delegates might be recalled by the legislatures , and were liable to be instructed by them . 14 . The ratification of the articles by the states was by delegates acting under instructions of the state legislatures. 15 . And every delegate in signing expressly declared that he did so " on the part and behalf of the state " ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared their assent to the articles which were drawn up in 1778 . Maryland withheld her assent till 1781 ; a fact which distinctly negatives all notion of the nationality of the act . It is time that I should now lay before the student judge Upshur 's remarks on the subject , of which I have been treating : " The examination of this part of the subject has probably been already drawn out to too great an extent ; but it would not be complete without some notice of another ground , upon which our author rests his favourite idea  - -  that the people of the colonies formed ' one people ' or nation . Even if this unity was not produced by the appointment of the revolutionary government , or by the nature of the powers exercised by them , and acquiesced in by the people , he thinks there can be no doubt that this was the necessary result of the declaration of independence . In order that he may be fully understood upon this point , I will transcribe the entire passage relating to it : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severally act for themselves and proclaim their own independence . It is true that some of the states had previously formed incipient governments for themselves ; but it was done in compliance with the recommendations of congress . Virginia , on the 29th of June 1776 , by a convention of delegates , declared ' the government of this country , as formerly exercised under the crown of Great Britain , totally dissolved , ' and proceeded to form a new constitution of government . New Hampshire also formed a new government in December 1775 , which was manifestly intended to be temporary , 1 during ( as they said ) the unhappy and unnatural contest with Great Britain . ' New Jersey , too , established a frame of government on the 2d July 1776 ; but it was expressly declared that it should be void upon a reconciliation with Great Britain . And South Carolina , in March 1776 , /z/ adopted a constitution of government ; but this was in like manner ' established until an accommodation between Great Britain and America could be obtained . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the united act of all . It was ' a declaration by the representatives of the United States of America , in congress assembled ; '  --  ' by the delegates appointed by the good people of the colonies , ' as , in a prior declaration of rights , they were called . It was not an act done by the state governments then organized , nor by persons chosen by them . It was emphatically the act of the whole people of the United Colonies , by the instrumentality of their representatives , chosen for that , among other purposes . It was an act not competent to the state governments , or any of them , as organized under their charters , to adopt . Those charters neither contemplated the case nor provided for it . It was an act of original , inherent sovereignty by the people themselves , resulting from their right to change the form of government , and to institute a new government , whenever necessary for their safety and happiness . So the declaration of independence treats it . No state had presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or provide for the exigencies of the times , without consulting congress on the subject ; and when they acted , it was in pursuance of the recommendation of congress . It was , therefore , the achievement of the whole for the benefit of the whole . The people of the United Colonies made the United Colonies free and independent states , and absolved them from allegiance to the British crown . The declaration of independence has , accordingly , always been treated as an act of paramount and sovereign authority , complete and perfect per sc ; and ipso facto working an entire dissolution of all political connexion with , and allegiance to , Great Britain . And this , not merely as a practical fact , but in a legal and constitutional view of the matter by courts of justice . ' " The first question which this passage naturally suggests to the mind of the reader is this : if two or more nations or people , confessedly separate , distinct and independent , each having its own peculiar government , without any ' direct political connexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one common superior , should /z/ unite in a declaration of rights which they believed belonged to all of them alike , would that circumstance alone make them ' one people ? ' Stripped of the circumstances with which the author has surrounded it , this is , at last , the only proposition involved . If Spain , Naples and Holland , while they were ' dependencies ' of the imperial crown of France , had united in declaring that they were oppressed , in the same mode and degree , by the measures of that crown , and that they did , for that reason , disclaim all allegiance to it , and assume the station of ' free and independent states , ' would they thereby have become one people ? Surely this will not be asserted by any one . We should see , in that act , nothing more than the union of several independent sovereignties , for the purpose of effecting a common object , which each felt itself too weak to effect , alone . Nothing would be more natural , than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common treasury , and a common agency , through which to carry on their intercourse with other powers ; but that all this should unite them together , so as to form them into one nation , is a consequence not readily perceived . The case here supposed , is precisely that of the American colonies , if those colonies were , in point of fact , separate , distinct , and independent of one another . If they were so , ( and I think it has been shewn that they were , ) then the fact that they united in the declaration of independence , does not make them ' one people , ' any more than a similar declaration would have made Spain , Naples and Holland one people ; if they were not so , then they were one people already , and the declaration of independence did not render them either more or less identical . It is true , the analogy here supposed does not hold in every particular ; the relations of the colonies to one another were certainly closer , in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to one another . But as to all purposes involved in the present enquiry , the analogy is perfect . The effect attributed to the declaration of independence , presupposes that the colonies were not ' one people ' before ; an effect which is in no manner changed or modified by any other circumstance in their relation to one another . That fact , alone , is necessary to be enquired into ; and until that fact is ascertained , the author 's reasoning as to the effect of the /z/ declaration of independence , in making them ' one people , ' does not apply . He is obliged , therefore , to abandon the ground previously taken , to wit , that the colonies were one people before the declaration of independence . And having abandoned it , he places the colonies , as to this question , upon the footing of any other separate and distinct nations ; and , as to these , it is quite evident that the conclusion which he has drawn in the case of the colonies , could not be correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain , Naples and Holland , above supposed . " The mere fact , then , that the colonies united in the declaration of independence , did not necessarily make them one people . But it may be said that this fact ought , at least , to be received as proof that they considered themselves as one people already . The argument is fair , and I freely let it go for what it is worth . The opinion of the congress of 1775 , whatever it may have been , and however strongly expressed , could not possibly change the historical facts . It depended upon those facts , alone , whether the colonies were one people or not . They might , by their agreement , expressed through their agents in congress , make themselves one people through all time to come ; but their power , as to this matter , could not extend to the time past . Indeed , it is contended , not only by our author , but by others , that the colonies did , by and in that act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They suppose that such agreement is implied , if not expressed , in the following passages : ' We , therefore , the representatives of the United States of America , '  --  ' do , in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies , solemnly publish and declare that these United Colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent states . ' Let us test the correctness of this opinion , by the history of the time , and by the rules of fair criticism . " The congress of 1775 , by which independence was declared , was appointed , as has been before shewn , by the colonies in their separate and distinct capacity , each acting for itself , and not conjointly with any other . They were the representatives , each of his own colony , and not of any other ; each had authority to act in the name of his own colony , and not in that of any other ; each colony /z/ gave its own vote by its own representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , it was as separate and distinct colonies that they deliberated on the declaration of independence . When , therefore , they declare , in the adoption of ihat measure , that they act as ' the representatives of the United States of America , ' and ' in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies , ' they must of course be understood as speaking in the character in which they had all along acted ; that is , as the representatives of separate and distinct colonies , and not as the joint representatives of any one people . A decisive proof of this , is found in the fact , that the colonies voted on the adoption of that measure in their separate character , each giving one vote by all its own representatives , who acted in strict obedience to specific instructions from their respective colonies , and the members signed the declaration in that way . So , also , when they declared that ' these United Colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , which until then had been dependent colonies , should thereafter be independent states , and that the same union which existed between them as colonies , should be continued between them as states . The measure under consideration looked only to their relation to the mother country , and not to their relation to one another ; and the sole question before them was , whether they should continue in a state of dependence on the British crown , or not . Having determined that they would not , they from that moment ceased to be colonies , and became states ; united , precisely as before , for the common purpose of achieving their common liberty . The idea of forming a closer union , by the mere act of declaring themselves independent , could scarcely have occurred to any one of them . The necessity of such a measure must have been apparent to all , and it had long before engaged their attention in a different form . Men , of their wisdom and forecast , meditating a measure so necessary to their common safety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference from another measure . In point of fact , it was already before them , in the form of a distinct proposition , and had been so ever since their first meeting in May /z/ 1775. ( c ) It is impossible to suppose , therefore , in common justice to the sagacity of congress , that they meant any thing more by the declaration of independence , than simply to sever the tie which had theretofore bound them to England , and to assert the rights of the separate and distinct colonies , as separate and independent states ; particularly as the language which they use is fairly susceptible of this construction . The instrument itself is entitled , ' the unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America ; ' of states , separate and distinct bodies politic , and not of ' one people ' or nation , composed of all of them together ; ' united , ' as independent states may be , by compact or agreement , and not amalgamated , as they would be , if they formed one nation or body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with elsewhere , but which may be found in the Appendix to professor Tucker 's elaborate and instructive Life of Jefferson , affords important evidence upon this point . As early as May 1775 , the plan of a " confederation and perpetual union " among the colonies , was prepared and proposed for adoption . It was not in fact adopted , but its provisions shew , in the strongest manner , in what light the colonies regarded their relation to one another . The proposed union was called " a firm league of friendship ; " each colony reserved to itself " as much as it might think proper of its own present laws , customs , rights , privileges and peculiar jurisdictions , within its own limits ; and may amend its own constitution as may seem best to its own assembly or convention ; " the external relations of the colonies were to be managed by their general government alone , and all amendments of their " constitution , " as they termed it , were to be proposed by congress and " approved by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contended that this " league of friendship , " this " confederation and perpetual union , " would , if it had been adopted , have rendered the people of the several colonies less identical than they were before . If , in their own opinion , they were " one people " already , no league or confederation was necessary , and no one would have thought of proposing it . The very fact , therefore , that it was proposed as a necessary measure " for their common defence against their enemies , for the security of their liberties and their properties , the safety of their persons and families , and their mutual and general welfare , " proves that they did not consider themselves as already " one people , " in any sense or to any extent which would enable them to effect those important objects . This proposition was depending and undetermined at the time of the declaration of independence . /z/ " Is it true then , as the author supposes , that the ' colonies did not severally act for themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they acted together ; but is it not equally true that each acted for itself alone , without pretending to any right or authority to bind any other ? Their declaration was simply their joint expression of their separate wills ; each expressing its own will , and not that of any other ; each bound by its own act , and not responsible for the act of any other . If the colonies had severally declared their independence through their own legislatures , and had afterwards agreed to unite their forces together , to make a common cause of their contest , and to submit their common interests to the management of a common council chosen by themselves , wherein would their situation have been different ' ? And is it true that this declaration of independence ' was not an act done by the state governments then organized , nor by persons chosen by them ? ' that ' it was emphatically the act of the whole people of the United Colonies , by the instrumentality of their representatives chosen for that among other purposes ? ' What representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Colonies ? When and how were they chosen ? Those who declared the colonies independent were chosen more than a year before that event ; they were chosen by the colonies separately , and , as has already been shewn , through the instrumentality of their own ' governments then organized ; ' they were chosen , not for the ' purpose ' of declaring the colonies independent , but of protecting them against oppression , and bringing about a reconciliation with the parent country , upon fair terms , if possible . ( Jefferson 's Notes , 1st ed. 128 , 129 . ) If there were any other representatives than these concerned in the declaration of independence , if that act was performed by representatives chosen by ' the whole people of the colonies , ' for that or any other purpose , if any such representatives could possibly have been chosen by the colonies as then organized , no historical record , that has yet met my view , contains one syllable of the matter . " The author seems to attach but little importance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate governments for themselves , prior to the declaration /z/ of independence . He regards this as of little consequence ; because he thinks that the colonies so acted only in pursuance of the recommendation of congress , and would not have ' presumed ' to do it , ' without consulting congress upon the subject ; ' and because the governments so established were , for the most part , designed to be temporary , and to continue only during the contest with England . Such recommendation was given , in express terms , to New Hampshire and South Carolina , in November 1775 , and to Virginia , in December of that year ; and on the 10th May 1776 , ' it was resolved to recommend to the respective assemblies and conventions of the United Colonies , where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs had been established , to adopt such a government as should , in the opinion of the representatives of the people , best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular , and of America in general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 15th May . ( 1 Elliott 's Debates , 80 , 83 . ) It is evident , from the language here employed , that congress claimed no power over the colonies as to this matter , and no right to influence or control them in the exercise of the important function of forming their own governments . It recommended only ; and , contemplating the colonies as separate and distinct , referred it to the assembly or convention of each , to establish any form of government which might be acceptable to its own people . Of what consequence was it , whether the colonies acted upon the recommendation and advice of others , or merely upon their own will and counsels ? With whatever motive the act was performed , it was one of supreme and sovereign power , and such as could not have been performed except by a sovereign people . And whether the government so established was intended to last for ever , or only for a limited time , did not affect its character as an act of sovereign power . In point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , by that very act , assert their sovereignty and independence . They had no power , under their charters , to change their governments . They could do so only by setting their charters aside , and acting upon their inherent , sovereign right : and this was revolution . In effect , therefore , many of the colonies had declared their independence prior to /z/ the 4th July , 1776 ; they had commenced the revolution , and were considered by England as in a state of rebellion . Of Virginia this is emphatically true . Her declaration of rights was made on the 12th of June 1776 ; and her constitution was adopted on the 29th of the same month . This constitution continued until 1829 . Her subsequent declaration of independence , on the 4th of July , in common with the other colonies , was but a more public , though not a more solemn affirmation of what she had previously done ; a pledge to the whole world , that what she had resolved on in her separate character , she would unite with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself free and independent more distinctly , in that form , than she had already done , by asserting her sovereign and irresponsible power , in throwing off her former government , and establishing a new one for herself . ( d ) ( d ) In point of fact , Virginia declared her indepem 15th of May 1776 . The following beautiful allusion 1 idence on the to that scene is extracted from an address delivered by judge Beverly Tucker , of William and Mary college , before the Petersburg lyceum on the 15th May 1839 : " That spectacle , on this day sixty-three years , Virginia exhibited to the world ; and the memory of that majestic scene it is now my task to rescue from oblivion . It was on that day that she renounced her colonial dependence on Great Britain , and separated herself forever from that kingdom . Then it was that , bursting the manacles of a foreign tyranny , she , in the same moment , imposed upon herself the salutary restraints of law and order . In that moment she commenced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having perfected that work , she , on the 29th of June in the same vear , performed the highest function of independent sovereignty , by adopting , ordaining and establishing the constitution under which all of us were born . Then it was that , sufficient to herself for all the purposes of government , she prescribed that oath of fealty and allegiance to her sole and separate sovereignty , which all of us , who have held any office under her authority , have solemnly called upon the Searcher of hearts to witness and record . In that hour , gentlemen , it could not be certainly known , that the other colonies would take the same decisive step . It was , indeed , expected . In the same breath in which she had declared her own independence , Virginia had advised it . She had instructed her delegates in the general congress to urge it ; and it was by the voice of one of her sons , whose name will ever proudly live in her history , that the word of power was spoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent kingdom fell asunder , ' as flax that severs at the touch of fire . ' But even then , and while the terms of the general declaration of independence /z/ " There is yet another view of this subject , which can not be properly omitted . It has already been shewn that , prior to the revolution , the colonies were separate and dis- were yet unsettled , hers had already gone forth . The voice of her defiance was already ringing in the tyrant 's ears ; hers was the cry that summoned him to the strife ; hers was the shout that invited his vengeance : ' - Me ! me ! Ailsum qui feci ; in me , convertite ferritin. ' /z/ This beautiful address , abounding in patriotic sentiments , and sound political doctrines , clothed in the richest language , ought to be in the hands of every citizen , and particularly of those of Virginia . The following extract from the journals of the convention , containing the history of this interesting event , can not fail to be acceptable to every American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The convention , then , according to the order of the day , resolved itself into a committee on the state of the colony , and , after some time spent therein , Mr. President resumed the chair , and Mr. Cary reported that the committee had , according to order , had under their consideration the state of the colony , and had come to the following resolutions thereupon ; which he read in his place , and afterwards delivered in at the clerk 's table , where the same were again twice read , and unanimously agreed to ; one hundred and twelve members being present . " For as much as all the endeavours of the United Colonies , by the most decent representations and petitions to the king and parliament of Great Britain , to restore peace and security to America under the British government , and a reunion with that people , upon just and liberal terms , instead of a redress of grievances , have produced , from an imperious and vindictive administration , increased insult , oppression , and a vigorous attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these colonies are declared to be in rebellion , and out of the protection of the British crown , our properties subjected to confiscation , our people , when captivated , compelled to join in the plunder and murder of their relations and countrymen , and all former rapine and oppression of Americans declared legal and just . Fleets and armies are raised , and the aid of foreign troops engaged to assist these destructive purposes . The king 's representative in this colony hath not only withheld all the powers of government from operating for our safety , but , having retired on board an armed ship , is carrying on a piratical and savage war against us ; tempting our slaves by every artifice to resort to him , and training and employing them against their masters . " In this state of extreme danger , we have no alternative left , but an abject submission to the will of those overbearing tyrants , or a total separation from the crown and government of Great Britain , uniting and exerting the strength of all America for defence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , or for any purpose of government , ' one people . ' The sovereignty over them was in the British crown ; but that sovereignty was not jointly over all , but separately over each , and might have been abandoned as to some , and retained as to others . The declaration of independence broke this connexion . By that act , and not by the subsequent recognition of their independence , the colonies became free states . What then became of the sovereignty of which we speak ? It could not be in abeyance ; the moment it was lost by the British crown it must have vested somewhere else . Doubtless it vested in the states themselves . But as they were separate and distinct as colonies , the sovereignty over one and forming alliances with foreign powers for commerce and aid in war . Wherefore , appealing to the Searcher of all hearts for the sincerity of former declarations , expressing our desire to preserve our connexion with that nation , and that we are driven from that inclination by their wicked councils , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delegates appointed to represent this colony in general congress , be instructed to propose to that respectable body , to declare the United Colonies free and independent states , absolved from all allegiance to , or dependence upon , the crown or parliament of Great Britain ; and that they give the assent of this colony to that declaration , and to whatever measures may be thought proper and necessary by the congress , for forming foreign alliances , and a confederation of the colonies , at such time and in such manner as to them may seem best . Provided , that the power of forming government for , and the regulations of the internal concerns of each colony , be left to the respective colonial legislatures . " Resolved , unanimously , that a committee be appointed to prepare a declaration of rights , and such a plan of government , as will be most likely to maintain peace and order in this colony , and secure substantial and equal liberty to the people . " And a committee was appointed of the following gentlemen : Mr. Archibald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Lee , Mr. Treasurer , Mr. Henry , Mr. Dandridge , Mr. Edmund Randolph , Mr. Gilmer , Mr. Bland , Mr. Digges , Mr. Carrington , Mr. Thomas Ludwell Lee , Mr. Cabell , Mr. Jones , Mr. Blair , Mr. Fleming , Mr. Tazewell , Mr. Richard Cary , Mr. Bullit , Mr. Watts , Mr. Banister , Mr. Page , Mr. Starke , Mr. David Mason , Mr. Adams , Mr. Read and Mr. Thomas Lewis . " It is impossible to contemplate this proceeding on the part of Virginia , without being convinced that she acted from her own freehand sovereign will ; and that she , at least , did " presume " to establish a government for herself , without the least regard to the recommendation or the pleasure of congress . /z/ could not vest , either in whole or in part , in any other . Each took to itself that sovereignty which applied to itself , and for which alone it had contended with the British crown , to wit , the sovereignty over itself . Thus each colony became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they claim in the very terms of the declaration of independence ; in this character they formed the colonial government , and in this character that government always regarded them . Indeed , even in the earlier treaties with foreign powers , the distinct sovereignty of the states is carefully recognized . Thus , the treaty of alliance with France , in 1778 , is made between ' the most Christian king and the United States of North America , to wit : New Hampshire , Massachusetts Bay , Rhode Island , Connecticut , ' &c,; enumerating them all by name . The same form is observed in the treaty of amity and commerce with the states general of the United Netherlands , in 1782 , and in the treaty with Sweden , in 1783 . In the convention with the Netherlands , in 1782 , concerning recaptured vessels , the names of the states are not recited , but ' the United States of America ' is the style adopted ; and so also in some others . This circumstance shews that the two forms of expression were considered equipollent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary government , considered that they treated with distinct sovereignties , through their common agent , and not with a new nation , composed of all those sovereign countries together . It is true , they treated with them jointly , and not severally ; they considered them all bound to the observance of their stipulations , and they believed that the common authority , which was established between and among them , was sufficient to secure that object . The provisional articles with Great Britain , in 1782 , by which our independence was acknowledged , proceed upon the same idea . The first article declares , that ' His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said United States , to ivit : New Hampshire , Massachusetts Bay , Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , North Carolina , South Carolina and Georgia , to be free , sovereign and independent states ; that he treats with them as such , ' &c.; Thus the very act , by which their former sovereign re- /z/ leases them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by name the sovereignty within its own limits , and acknowledges it to be a ' free , sovereign and independent state ; ' united , indeed , with all the others , but not as forming with them any new and separate nation . The language employed is not suited to convey any other idea . If it had been in the contemplation of the parties , that the states had merged themselves into a single nation , something like the following formula would naturally have suggested itself as proper . ' His Britannic Majesty acknowledges that New Hampshire , Massachusetts Bay , &.c,; former colonies of Great Britain , and now united together as one people , are a free , sovereign and independent state J &c.; The difference between the two forms of expression , and the strict adaptation of each to the state of things which it contemplates , will be apparent to every reader . " It requires strong and plain proof to authorize us to say , that a nation once sovereign has ceased to be so . And yet our author requires us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not tell , with any degree of confidence or precision , when , how , or to what extent the sovereignty , which they acquired by declaring their independence , was surrendered . According to him , the colonies are to be presumed to have yielded this sovereignty to a government established by themselves for a special and temporary purpose , which existed only at their will , and by their aid and support ; whose powers were wholly undefined , and , for the most part , exercised by usurpation on its part , and legitimated only by the acquiescence of those who appointed it ; whose authority was without any adequate sanction which it could itself apply , and which , as to all the important functions of sovereignty , was a mere name  --  the shadow of power without its substance ! If the fact was really so , I venture to affirm that the history of the world affords no similar instance of folly and infatuation . " But , whatever may have been the condition of the colonies prior to 1781 , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final ratification of the articles of confederation in that year . Those articles declare that ' each state retains its sovereignty , freedom and independence , and every power , jurisdiction and right , which is not , by /z/ this confederation , expressly delegated to the United States , in congress assembled . ' The obvious construction of this clause requires that we should apply these latter words , only to ' powers , jurisdiction and rights ; ' some of which , as enjoyed by the states under the previous government , were clearly surrendered by the articles of confederation . But their entire sovereignty , their entire freedom , and their entire independence , are reserved , for these are not partible . Indeed , this is clear enough , from the provisions of that instrument , which , throughout , contemplate the states as free , sovereign and independent . It is singular , too , that it should escape the observation of any one , that the very fact of adopting those articles , and the course pursued in doing so , attest , with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states . What had the states in their separate character to do with that act , if they formed altogether ' one people V And yet the states , and the states alone , performed it , each acting for itself , and binding itself . The articles were confirmed by ten states , as early as 1778 , by another in 1779 , and by another in 1780 ; and yet they were not obligatory until Maryland acceded to them . 1781 . Nothing less than the ratification of them by all the states , each acting separately for itself , was deemed sufficient to give them any binding force or authority . " There is much force and meaning in the word ' retains , ' as it occurs in the clause above quoted . Nothing can properly be said to be retained , which was not possessed before ; and , of course , the states possessed before ' sovereignty , freedom and independence . ' These they retained without any qualification , or limitation , and they also retained every ' power , jurisdiction and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If these views of the subject be not wholly deceptive , our author has hazarded , without due caution , the opinion that the colonies formed ' one people , ' either before or after the declaration of independence ; and that they are not to be regarded as sovereign states , after that event . For myself , I profess my utter inability to perceive , in their condition , any nearer approach to ' political personality or individuality , ' than may be found in a mere league or confederation between sovereign and independent states ; and a very loose confederation theirs undoubtedly was . " CONSTITUTIONAL LAW . Ill /z/ Before I proceed to any examination of the present constitution , which was the next step in the political progress of the United States , it may not be unprofitable to look back to the confederation , and take a rapid view of the causes which led to the adoption of another form of government . Whatever may be the truth , in a speculative point of view , as to the American colonies having constituted one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anterior to the revolution , efforts had been made in vain for the formation of associations among them , for their mutual support and protection . They are said to have been jealous of each other 's prosperity , and divided by policy , institutions , prejudice and manners ; ( a ) and even after the commencement of the revolution , when the pressure of British power made some league or association essential , they seem to have felt that it was the true path of safety , to retain all sovereign powers in their own hands , except those , which imperious necessity demanded should be placed in the hands of the irregular revolutionary government . From the batttle of Lexington in 1775 , to the month of August 1778 , a war with one of the most powerful nations of the globe , was waged by a congress composed of delegates from the states , appointed either by state legislatures , or conventions ; and deriving its powers partly from the commissions of its members , but mainly from the necessities of the time . ( b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a league or confederation , which was not however ratified by all the states till 1781 . By the articles of confederation , congress was invested with the powers of peace and war , of sending and receiving ambassadors , of making treaties with certain restrictions , of coining and borrowing money , of emitting bills of credit , of ascertaining the necessary sums , and troops and ships required for ( a ) 1 Kent . 205. ( 6 ) 3Dall. 91. /z/ the public service , and of appropriating money ; together with some other powers of minor character . But the most important of those above mentioned , were unaccompanied by any power to carry them into execution . Most of the granted powers , required for their exercise , the assent of nine states ; and when they wtre exercised , they depended altogether upon the faith and punctuality of the states , in complying with requisitions . There was no power to raise a revenue or lay a tax ; for the authority as to this matter , only extended to " ascertaining " the sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no law , secure no right , and though entitled to send ambassadors , they had no authority to raise the means of paying them . They could contract debts , but had no means of discharging them . They could pledge the public faith , but could not redeem it . They could make treaties , but not enforce them , and every power which did not execute itself , might be trampled upon with impunity . In short , in the language of general Washington , " the confederation was a shadow without the substance ; " congress could declare every thing , but do nothing ; borrow money , but not repay a dollar ; coin money without the ability of purchasing bullion , and make requisitions which were not complied with , or very unequally , if at all . It has been justly observed , ( e ) " that a government authorized to declare war , but relying on independent states for the means of prosecuting it , capable of contracting debts , and of pledging the public faith for their payment , but depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could only be rescued from ignominy and contempt by finding those sovereignties administered by men exempt from the passions incident to human nature ! " A hopeless expectation surely ! and experience soon demonstrated/ ) that the great and radical vice in the construction of the confederation , was in the principle of legislation for states and governments in their corporate or collective capacities , as contradistinguished from the individuals of whom they consist . A consequence of this was the want of power in congress to give a sanction to its laws . They had no power to ex- ( c ) 5 Mars . Life of Wash . 31. ( d ) See the Fed . No. 15. /z/ act obedience or to punish infraction , for they had no express authority to exercise force , and they had no power except what was expressly given . Hence when they made requisitions , it depended upon the good will or the energy of the state legislatures , whether they complied at all ; and as congress had no power to lay or levy taxes , or to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a noncompliance by the states left empty the treasury of the Union . Thus it appears , that the requisitions for the payment of the interest on the domestic debt from 1782 to 178G , amounted to more than six millions , and up to March 1787 , only one million was paid : and from November 1784 , to January 1786 , only 483,000 dollars had been paid into the national treasury . Another and most important defect of the confederation , was the want of power in congress to regulate foreign and domestic commerce ; thus making no provision against one of the most fruitful sources of dissention between the states . Nor was this all . Without some general power over the subject , the commerce of the Union was fated to embarrassment and to languishing . During the war , it had been nearly annihilated by the superior naval power of Great Britain , and the return of peace enabled her in a great measure to monopolize all the benefits of our trade . British ships , with their commodities , had free admission into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy exactions , or were prohibited from entry into British ports . In April 1784 , congress asked the power for fifteen years only to prohibit the importation and exportation of goods in the ships of nations with whom we had no commercial treaties , and to prohibit subjects of foreign nations from importing any goods not the produce or manufacture of the dominions of their own sovereign . It was refused , as was also a subsequent proposal to grant the power of regulating commerce and laying duties , though those duties were to be collected by and paid over to the states . This proposition did not find sufficient countenance even in congress itself for its passage by that body , and thus the regulation of commerce by congress , which under our present constitution has been found to contribute so largely to our national prosperity , was rejected , even in its least objectionable and least alarming form . /z/ There were other defects seriously urged against the confederation , which justified doubts of its efficacy as a bond of union , or as an enduring scheme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia , ( e ) to meet commissioners from other states , to take into consideration the trade of the United States , and the relative situation of the trade of the states ; and to report such an act on the subject , as when ratified would enable congress to provide the necessary regulations . The commissioners of five states only , met at Annapolis in September 1786 , and recommended the appointment of other commissioners , to meet at Philadelphia in May thereafter , " to take into consideration the situation of the United States , and to devise such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the Union ; and to report also such an act to congress as when agreed to by it , and ratified by the states , would effectually provide for the same . " In February 1787 , a motion was accordingly moved , and carried in congress , recommending a convention in Philadelphia , for the purpose of revising and amending the articles of confederation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to send representatives , ) and in September 1787 , adopted the present constitution ; and directed it to be laid before congress , recommending , at the same time , that it should be submitted to conventions of delegates chosen in each state by the people thereof , under a recommendation of its legislature for their assent and ratification . Conventions accordingly met , and the constitution was at length finally adopted with amendments , though the ratification of North Carolina was delayed till November 1789 , and that of Rhode Island until May 1790 . During the respective intervals , those states were altogether sovereign and independent . For nine states having adopted the constitution , the old confederation was at an end , and the new government went into operation on the 4th of March 1789 , at which date , neither of those states were members of the Union . General Washington was sworn into office on the 30th of April 1789. ( c ) The commissioners for Virginia who acted , were Edmund Randolph , James Madison and St. George Tucker . /z/ After this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States , I shall now proceed to the consideration of its nature , presenting the student , however , in the first instance , with judge Story 's view of the same matter , as he has given it to us in the 3d chapter of the 3d book of his Commentaries : " 308 . In the first place , " says he , " what is the true nature and import of the instrument ? Is it a treaty , a convention , a league , a contract , or a compact ? Who are the parties to it ? By whom was it made ? By whom was it ratified 1 What are its obligations ? By whom , and in what manner may it be dissolved ? Who are to determine its validity and construction ? Who are to decide upon the supposed infractions and violations of it ? These are questions often asked , and often discussed , not merely for the purpose of theoretical speculation , but as matters of practical importance , and of earnest and even of vehement debate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution of the United States is an original , written , federal , and social compact , freely , voluntarily , and solemnly entered into by the several states , and ratified by the people thereof respectively ; whereby the several states , and the people thereof , respectively have bound themselves to each other , and to the federal government of the United States , and by which the federal government is bound to the several states and to every citizen of the United States . The author proceeds to expound every part of this definition at large . It is ( says he ) a compact , by which it is distinguished from a charter or grant , which is either the act of a superior to an inferior , or is founded upon some consideration moving from one of the parties to the other , and operates as an exchange or sale . ( ) But here the contracting parties , whether considered as states in their political capacity and character , or as individuals , are all equal ; nor is there any thing granted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 1 Tucker 's Black .

" 311 . It is a federal compact . ( A ) Several sovereign and independent states may unite themselves together by a perpetual confederation , without each ceasing to be a perfect state . They will together form a federal republic . The deliberations in common will offer no violence to each member , though they may in certain respects put some constraint on the exercise of it in virtue of voluntary engagements . The extent , modifications , and objects of the federal authority are mere matters of discretion . ( t ) So long as the separate organization of the members remains , and , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both for local and domestic , and for federal purposes , the union is in fact , as well as in theory , an association of states , or a confederacy . It may be proper to illustrate the distinction between federal compacts and obligations , and such as are social , by one or two examples . ( &); A federal compact , alliance , or treaty , is an act of the state or body politic , ( h ) Mr. Jefferson asserts , that the constitution of the United States is a compact between the states . " They entered into a compact , " says he , ( in a paper designed to be adopted by the legislature of Virginia , as a solemn protest , ) " which is called the Constitution of the United States of America , by which they agreed to unite in a single government , as to their relations with each , and with foreign nations , and as to certain other articles particularly specified . " * It would , I imagine , be very difficult to point out when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The constitution was neither made , nor ratified by the states , as sovereignties , or political communities . It was framed by a convention ! proposed to the people of the states for their adoption by congress ; and was adopted by state conventions  --  the immediate representatives of the people . ( i ) 1 Tucker 's Black . Comm . Appx. note D , p. 141. ( k ) Id . 145. * 4 Jefferson 's Corresp. 415. f To prove that the constitution was not made by the states , our author says it was framed by a convention . A convention of whom ? Of the delegates of thirteen separate and distinct communities , each responsible to its own state only , voting by states , and each state having but one vote . These delegates were appointed by the state legislatures , and were subject to their control . This convention was called at the suggestion of Jive states , by the congress of the United States , which represented states . The constitution was recommended by it to the states , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing itself only , and ratified the constitution . Throughout the whole the action was state action . There was no nationality about it . See the remarks , Lectures , p. /z/ and not of an individual . On the contrary , a social compact is understood to mean the act of individuals about to create and establish a state or body politic among themselves . If one nation binds itself by treaty to pay a certain tribute to another ; or if all the members of the same confederacy oblige themselves to furnish their quotas of a common expense , when required ; in either of these cases , the state or body politic only , and not the individual , is answerable for this tribute or quota . This is , therefore , a federal obligation . But , where by any compact , express or implied ; a number of persons are bound to contribute their proportions of the common expenses , or to submit to all laws made by the common consent ; and where in default of compliance with these engagements the society is authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the delinquent ; this seems to be understood to be more in the nature of a social , than a federal obligation . ( / ) " 314 . It is an original compact . Whatever political relation existed between the American colonies antecedent to the revolution , as constituent parts of the British empire , or as dependencies upon it , that relation was completely dissolved , and annihilated from that period . From the moment of the revolution they became severally independent and sovereign states , possessing all the rights , jurisdictions , and authority that other sovereign states , however constituted , or by whatever title denominated , possess ; and bound by no ties , but of their own creation , except such , as all other civilized nations are equally bound by , and which together constitute the customary law of nations . /z/ ( I ) 1 Tucker 's Black .

The result will shew , that , on revolutionary principles , the general government was , by the sovereign acts of this people , first created de novo , and de facto instituted ; and by the same acts , the people vested in it very extensive powers , which have ever remained in it modified and defined by the articles of confederation , and enlarged and arranged anew by the constitution of the United States  --  2d. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent states , were , July 4th , 1776 , created by the general government , empowered to do it by the people , acting on revolutionary principles , and in their original , sovereign capacity ; and that all the state governments , as such , have been instituted during the existence of the general government , and in subordination to it , and two thirds of them since the constitution of the United States was ordained and established by all the people thereof ; in that sovereign capacity . These state governments have been , by the people of each state , instituted under , and , expressly or impliedly , in subordination to the general government , which is expressly recognized by all to be supreme law ; and as the power of the whole is , in the nature of things , superior to the power of a part , other things being equal , the power of a state , a part , is inferior to the power of all the states .

Its duties being moreover imposed for the general benefit and security of the several states in their political character , and of the . people , both in their sovereign and individual capacity , if these objects be not obtained , the government does not answer the end of its creation .

We have already seen , that the framers of the instrument contemplated no such dependence . Even under the confederation it was deemed a gross heresy to maintain that a party to a compact has a right to revoke that compact ; and the possibility of a question of this nature was deemed to prove the necessity of laying the foundations of our national government deeper , than in the mere sanction of delegated authority .

" Id . p. 8 , 9. * Such a heresy will not be found in these pages . While their author admits that every party to a compact has a right to judge of its infraction , and to refuse longer to be bound by it when broken , he contends on the other hand , that every other party has an equal right to judge , and that the recusant acts upon his own responsibility , in undertaking to decide and to act contrary to the prevailing opinion of the other parties to the contract. t As a compact between the states , whereby they have ordained and established the constitution for the United States of America . The people of the thirteen distinct and separate political bodies or communities constituting states , agreed together in a general convention of delegates from them severally and respectively , to ordain and establish the constitution as a form of government for the United States . The constitution may therefore be looked upon rather as the result of the agreement , ( see page 339 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states is in the preamble , " We , the people of the United States , do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America . " /z/ or of the people thereof , whereby each of the several states , and the people thereof , have respectively bound themselves to each other ? Or is it a form of government , which , having been ratified by a majority of the people in all the states , is obligatory upon them , as the prescribed rule of conduct of the sovereign power , to the extent of its provisions ? " 351 . Let us consider , in the first place , whether it is to be deemed a compact . By this , we do not mean an act of solemn assent by the people to it , as a form of government , ( of which there is no room for doubt , ) but a contract imposing mutual obligations , and contemplating the permanent subsistence of parties having an independent right to construe , control , and judge of its obligations . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact , it must be , either because it contains on its face stipulations to that effect , or because it is necessarily implied from the nature and objects of a frame of government . " 352 . There is nowhere found upon the face* of the constitution any clause , intimating it to be a compact , or in anywise providing for its interpretation , as such . On the contrary , the preamble emphatically speaks of it , as a solemn ordinance and establishment of government . The language is , ' We , the people of the United States , do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America . ' The people do ordain and establish , not contract and stipulate with each other . ( x ) The people of the United States , not the distinct people of a. particular state ( x ) The words " ordain and establish " are also found in the 3d article of the constitution .

Plainly by a law ; and when ordained and established , is such a law a contract or compact between the legislature and the people , or the court , or the different departments of the government ? No . It is neither more nor less than a law , made by competent authority , upon an assent or agreement of minds . In Martin v. Hunter , ( 1 Wheat . R. 304 , 324 , ) the supreme court said , " The constitution of the United States was ordained * The fallacy of this position , and of the greater part of those which follow in the extract from the Commentaries , can not be fully exposed in a note .

( ? / ) It rests forever in articles of compact , where each is , or may be the supreme judge of its own rights and duties . The former is a permanent form of government , where the powers , once given , are irrevocable , and can not be resumed or withdrawn at pleasure . Whether formed by a single people , or by different societies of people , in their political capacity , a constitution , though originating in consent , becomes , when ratified , obligatory , as a fundamental ordinance or law. ( z ) The constitution of a confederated republic , that is , of a national republic formed of several states , is , or at least may be , not less an irrevocable form of goverment , than the constitution of a state formed and ratified by the aggregate of the several counties of the state . ( a ) * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modification , that though irrevocable by the ordinary forms of government , it may be revocable by the exercise of rights paramount to all constitutions ; but the state which asserts these rights , does so on its own responsibility , since in matters between states , if one has a right to judge , others have also .

The articles of confederation , though in some few respects national , were mainly of a pure federative character , and were treated as stipulations between states for many purposes independent and sovereign .

" Again , in the sixth article it is declared , that " all debts contracted , and engagements entered into , before the adoption of this constitution , shall be as valid against the United States under this constitution , as under the confederation .

The language of the third article was , ' The said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defence , &c.; binding themselves to assist each other .

( o ) In the North Carolina debates , one of the members laid it down , as a fundamental principle of every safe and free government , that ' a government is a compact between the rulers and the people . ' This was most strenuously denied on the other side by gentlemen of great eminence . They said , ' A compact can not be annulled , but by the consent of both parties . Therefore , unless the rulers are guilty of oppression , the people , on the principles of a compact , have no right to new-model their government . This is held to be the principle of some monarchical governments in Europe . Our government is founded on much nobler principles . The people are known with certainty to have originated it themselves . Those in power are their servants and agents . And the people without their consent , may new-model the government , whenever they think proper , not merely because it is oppressively exercised , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of stating the objection was just , but the fact abundantly appears in the printed debates . For instance , in the Virginia debates , ( 2 Elliot 's Deb. 47 , ) Mr. Henry said , " That this is a consolidated government is demonstrably clear . "  --  " The language is ' We , the people , ' instead of ' We , the states . ' States are the characteristics and soul of a confederation . If the states be not the agents of this compact , it must be one great consolidated national government of the people of all the states .

Nor should it be omitted , that in the most elaborate expositions of the constitution by its friends , its character , as a permanent form of government , as a fundamental law , as a supreme rule , which no state was at liberty to disregard , suspend or annul , was constantly admitted , and insisted on , as one of the strongest reasons , why it should be adopted in lieu of the confederation .

If all the people in six of the largest states were to concur , they would have no right to alter or abolish the constitution , though they would constitute a majority of the Union . For the compact can only be dissolved by the states , who made it , upon the clear principle , " dissolvitur eo modo quolegatur . , , Nor could it be dissolved by any one or more states , except upon the principles of revolution , which are above all law . It enters into no part of our system , that because the constitution is a compact , any party to it has a right to dissolve it , if it deems it to have been broken . This matter will be more fully developed hereafter . We scarcely need to express our total dissent to the views of Mr. Dane , presented in this passage . We do not recognize him as authority , and still less do we defer to his very unsatisfactory reasoning . We prefer rather to adopt the remark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not perceive ) distinctly adopts : " that the constitution was the result of the unanimous assent of the several states , that are parties to it .

" 360 . To us the doctrine of Mr. Dane appears far better founded , that ' the constitution of the United States is not a compact or contract agreed to by two or more parties , to be construed by each for itself , and here to stop for the want of a common arbiter to revise the construction of each party or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have named and called it , truly a constitution ; and they properly said , ' We , the people of the United States , do ordain and establish this constitution , ' and not , we , the people of each state . ' ( 0 ) And this exposition has been sustained by opinions of some of our most eminent statesmen ( n ) Dane 's App. 59 , 60 , p. 69 , 71. ( 0 ) Mr. ( afterwards Mr. justice ) Wilson , who was a member of the federal convention , uses , in the Pennsylvania Debates , the following language : " We were told , foe . that the convention no doubt thought they were forming a compact or contract of the greatest importance . It was matter of surprise to see the great leading principles of this system still so very much misunderstood . I can not answer for what every member thought ; but I believe it can not be said , they thought they were making a contract , because I can not discover the least trace of a compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there are more parties than one . It is a new doctrine , that one can make a compact with himself . ' The convention were forming contracts ! with whom ? I know no bargains , that were there made ; I am unable to conceive who the parties could be . The state governments make a bargain with each other . That is the doctrine , that is endeavoured to be established by gentlemen in the opposition ; their state sovereignties wish to be represented . But far other were the ideas of the convention . This is not a government founded upon compact . It is founded upon the poicer of the people . They express in their name and their authority , we , the people , do ordain and establish , ' &c.; 3 Elliot 's Debates , 286 , 287 .

It resulted from the unanimous assent of the several states that are parties to it , differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent , than its being expressed , not by the legislative authority but by that of the people themselves . 361 . But if the constitution could in the sense , to which we have alluded , be deemed a compact , between whom is it to be deemed a contract ? We have already seen , that the learned commentator on Blackstone , deems it a compact with several aspects , and first between the states , ( as contradistinguished from the people of the states , ) by which the several states have bound themselves to each other , and to the federal government. ( r ) The Virginia resolutions of 1798 , assert , that ' Virginia views the powers of the federal government , as resulting from the compact , to which the states are parties ? This declaration was , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion among the ablest representatives in the legislature . But when it was subsequently expounded by Mr. Madison in the celebrated report of January 1800 , after admitting , that the term ' states ' is used in different senses , and among others , that it sometimes means the people composing a political society in their highest sovereign capacity , he considers the resolution unobjectionable , at least in this last sense , because in that sense the constitution was submitted to the ' states ; ' in that sense the ' states ' ratified it ; and in that sense the states are consequently parties to the compact , from which the powers of the federal government result. ( s ) And that is the sense , in which he considers the states parties in his still later and more deliberate examinations . ( t ) ( p ) See Ware v. Hylton , 3 Dall. 199 ; 1 Cond .

This view of the subject is , however , wholly at variance* with that , on which we are commenting ; and which , having no foundation in the words of the constitution , is altogether a gratuitous assumption , and therefore inadmissible . It is no more true , that a state is a party to the constitution , as such , because it was framed by delegates chosen by the states , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states for ratification , and that the states are necessary agents to give effect to some of its provisions , than that for the same reasons the governor , or senate , or house of representatives , or judges , either of a state or of the United States , are parties thereto . No state , as such , that is , the body politic , ! as it was * It is singular that the commentator does not advert to the obvious principle that it is not the legislature but the people of the state who constitute the states ; and hence , that to constitute a compact between the states , the assent or act of the respective legislatures was not necessary , but the assent or act of the people themselves in the respective states , constituting distinct bodies politic from each other . The legislatures under our system could not have adopted the constitution . Acting under limited powers , they had no right to enter into any compact transferring part of their powers , and portions of the state sovereignty , to others . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was therefore necessary that the people of the state , who constitute the sovereignty , should ratify the instrument . They had that power , and when they exerted it , it was an exercise of state sovereignty ; and so the ratification of the constitution by them , in their respective conventions , was an act of state sovereignty , by which each state contracted with every other to establish and maintain the stipulated form of government. t Here the learned author clearly means the " legislatures ; " and what he says of their want of power to form a constitution , is strictly true , and well expressed . But he admits that " the people , in their original , sovereign capacity , had a right to change their form of government . " What people ? Not the people of the whole confederacy , as one ,  --  for there was none such ; but the people of each of the confederate states , who were then , at least , sovereign and independent . Judge Story feels the force of the distinction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states never , in fact , did in their political capacity , ( as contradistinguished from the people thereof , ) ratify the constitution . " That is to say , the legislatures did not , though he admits the people thereof ( that is , of each state ) did . And this is all we contend for : believing that the ratification by the people of each state , in their conventions , was an act of separate state sovereignty , which made the constitution a compact between states , and not a national or consolidated government . " /z/ actually organized , had any power to establish a contract for the establishment of any new government over the people thereof , or to delegate the powers of government in whole , or in part to any other sovereignty .

They had no authority to enter into any compact or contract for such a purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state constitutions ; and consequently , if actually entered into , ( as it was not , ) would have had no obligatory force . The people , and the people only , in their original sovereign capacity , had a right to change their form of government , to enter into a compact , and to transfer any sovereignty to the national government . ( u ) And the states never , in fact , did in their political capacity , as contradistinguished from the people thereof , ratify the constitution . They were not called upon to do it by congress ; and were not contemplated , as essential to give validity to it. ( * ) (  --  ) 4 Wheat . 404. ( v ) The Federalist , No. 39.  --  In confirmation of this view , we may quote the reasoning of the supreme court in the case of M ' Culloch v. Maryland , ( 4 Wheaton 's R. 316 , ) in answer to the very argument . " The powers of the general government , it has been said , are delegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be exercised in subordination to the states , who alone possess supreme dominion . " It would be difficult to sustain this proposition . The convention , which framed the constitution , was indeed elected by the state legislatures . But the instrument , when it came from their hands , was a mere proposal , without obligation , or pretensions to it . It was reported to the then existing congress of the United States , with a request , that it might ' be submitted to a convention of delegates , chosen in each state by the people thereof , under the recommendation of its legislature , for their assent and ratification . ' This mode of proceeding was adopted ; and by the convention , by congress , and by the state legislatures , the instrument was submitted to the people . They acted upon it in the only manner in which they can act safely , effectively , and wisely , on such a subject , by assembling in convention . It is true , they assembled in their several states  --  and where else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy of the chief justice . The argument of his . adversaries did not rest upon the place where the conventions met , but upon the convention of each state representing its own state alone as a sovereign state , and not as a fragment of the aggregate nation. /z/ " 363 . The doctrine , then , that the states are parties is a gratuitous assumption . In the language of a most dis- No political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down the lines , which separate the states , and of compounding the American people into one common mass. * Of consequence , when they act , they act in their states . But the measures they adopt do not , on that account , cease to be the measures of the people themselves , or become the measures of the state governments . " From these conventions the constitution derives its whole authority . The government proceeds directly from the people ; t is ' ordained and established ' in the name of the people ; and is declared to be ordained , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , ensure domestic tranquillity , and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to their posterity . ' The assent of the states , in their sovereign capacity , ! is implied in calling a convention , and thus submitting that instrument to the people . But the people were at perfect liberty to accept or reject it ; and their act was final . It required not the affirmance , and could not be negatived by the state governments . The constitution , when thus adopted , was of complete obligation , and bound the state sovereignties . " It has been said , that the people had already surrendered all their powers to the state sovereignties , and had nothing more to give . But surely , the question , whether they may resume and modify the powers granted to government , does not remain to be settled in this country . Much more might the legitimacy of the general government be doubted , had it been created by the states . The powers delegated to the state sovereignties were to be exercised by themselves , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the formation of a league , such as was the confederation , the state sovereignties were certainly competent . But when , ' in order to form a more perfect union , ' it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective government , possessing great and sovereign powers , and acting directly on the people , the necessity of referring it to the people , and of deriving its powers directly from them , was felt and acknowledged by all . * What would the chief justice have thought of the dreams of judge Stoi y , Mr. Webster , and Mr. Dane , whose favourite hypothesis is " the compounding the American people into one common mass . " See 363. y What people ? The people of the separate , free'and independent states of the confederacy ; each acting for itself : each having a power of absolute rejection whether ratified by others or not. t The calling the conventions was an act of the legislatures and not the act of the states in their sovereign capacity as to this matter .

Why could each state reject ? Why was little Delaware made equal with Virginia ? /z/ tinguished statesman , ( ta ) ' the constitution itself in its very front refutes that . It declares that it is ordained and established by the people of the United States . So far from saying that it is established by the governments of the several states , it does not even say , that it is established by the people of the several states . But it pronounces that it is established by the people of the United States in the aggregate. * Doubtless the people of the several states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States .

In form and in substance it emanates from them . Its powers are granted by them , and are to be exercised directly on them , and for their benefit .

( x ) Mr. Dane reasons to the same effect , though it is obvious , that he could not , at the time , have had any knowledge of the views of Mr. Webster. * He adds , " If a contract , when and how did the Union become a party to it ? If a compact , why is it never so denominated , but often and invariably in the instrument itself , and in its amendments , styled , ' this constitution ? And if a contract , why did the framers and people call it the supreme law ? ' t In Martin v.

Because , if the constitution be a compact between the states , still that constitution or that compact has established a government with certain powers ; and whether it be one of these powers , that it shall construe and interpret for itself the terms of the compact in doubtful cases , can only be decided by looking to the compact , and enquiring , what provisions it contains on that point . Without any inconsistency with natural reason , the government even thus created might be trusted with this power of construction .

Then , is it a compact between the people of the several states , each contracting with all the people of the other states 1(a) It may be admitted , as was the early ( y ) Webster 's Speeches , 429 ; 4 Elliot 's Debates , 324.

" Mr. Grimke filed a protest founded on different views of it . See Grimke 's Address and Resolutions in 1828 , ( edition , 1829 , at Charleston , ) where his exposition of the constitution is given at large , and maintained in a very able speech . * In this remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our subject will be given , however , hereafter , somewhat at large. /z/ exposition of its advocates , ' that the constitution is founded on the assent and ratification of the people of America , given by deputies elected for the special purpose ; but that this assent and ratification is to be given by the whole people , not as individuals , composing one entire nation , but as composing the distinct and independent states , to which they respectively belong . It is to be the assent and ratification of the several states , derived from the supreme authority in each state , the authority of the people themselves . The act , therefore , establishing the constitution will not be is not to be a national , but a federal act . ' ( &); 1 It may also be admitted , ' in the language of one of its most enlightened commentators , that ' it was formed , not by the governments of the component states , as the federal government , for which it was substituted , was formed . Nor was it formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a single community , in the manner of a consolidated government . It was formed by the states , that is , by the people in each of the states acting in their highest sovereign capacity ; and formed , consequently , by the same authority , which formed the state constitutions. ' ( c ) But this would not necessarily draw after it the conclusion , that it was to be deemed a compact , ( in the sense , to which we have so often alluded , ) by which each state was still , after the ratification , to act upon it , as a league or treaty , and to withdraw from it at pleasure . A. government may originate in the voluntary compact or assent of the people of several states , or of a people never before united , and yet when adopted and ratified by them , be no longer a matter resting in compact ; but become an executed government or constitution , a fundamental law , and not a mere league . But the difficulty in asserting it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the people of the other states is , that the constitution itself contains no such expression , and no such designation of parties .

But supposing , that it were to be deemed such a compact among the people of the several states , let us see what the enlightened statesman , who vindicates that opinion , holds as the appropriate deduction from it . ' Being thus derived ( says he ) from the same source , as the constitutions of the states , it has , within each state , the same authority as the constitution of the state ; and is as much a constitution within the strict sense of the term , within its prescribed sphere , as the constitutions of the states are , within their respective spheres . But with this obvious and essential difference , that being a compact among the states in their highest sovereign capacity , and constituting the people thereof one people for certain purposes , it can not be altered , or annulled at the will of the states individually , as the constitution of a state may be at its individual xviU.

Mr. Paterson ( afterwards Mr. justice Paterson ) in the convention which framed the constitution , held the doctrine , that under the confederation no state had a right to withdraw from the Union without the consent of all . " The confederation ( said he ) * The constitution of the United States is a compact between the people of the different states with each other as separate and independent sovereignties , whereby they ordained and established a government for the conduct of their national concerns . Its first clause is the act of all the states agreeing with each other to establish that constitution . The national government is the result of this agreement .

The other branch of the proposition , we have been considering , is , that it is not only a compact between the several states , and the people thereof , but also a compact between the states and the federal government ; and e converso between the federal government , and the several states , and every citizen of the United States. ( g- ) This seems to be a doctrine far more involved , and extraordinary , and incomprehensible , than any part of the preceding . The difficulties have not escaped the observation of those , by whom it has been advanced . ' Although ( says the learned commentator ) the federal government can , in no possible viezv , be considered as a party to a compact made anterior to its existence ; yet , as the creature of that compact , it must be bound by it to its creators , the several states in the Union , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , no more were meant than to state , that the federal government can not lawfully exercise any powers , except those conferred on it by the constitution , its truth could not admit of dispute . But it is plain , that something more was in the author 's mind . At the same time , that he admits , that the federal government could not be a party to the compact of the constitution ' in any possible view , ' he still seems to insist upon it , as a compact , by which the is in the nature of a compact ; and can any state , unless by the consent of the whole , either in politics or law , withdraw their powers ? Let it be said by Pennsylvania and the other large states , that they , for the sake of peace , assented to the confederation ; can she now resume her original right without the consent of the donee ? " * Mr. Dane unequivocally holds the same language in respect to the constitution . " It is clear ( says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never can take , or withdraw power from the United States , which was granted to it by all , as the people of all the states can do rightfully in a justifiable revolution , or as the people can do in the manner their constitution prescribes . " Dane 's App. 10 , p. 21 . The ordinance of 1787 , for the government of the western territory , contains ( as we have seen ) certain articles declared to be " articles of compact ; " but they are are also declared to " remain forever unalterable , except by common consent . " So that there may be a compact , and yet by the stipulations neither party may be at liberty to withdraw from it , or absolve itself from its obligations . Ante , p. 269. ( g ) 1 Tucker 's Black .

( ? ) The difficulty of maintaining it , however , seems absolutely insuperable . The federal government is the result of the constitution , or ( if the phrase is deemed by any person more appropriate ) the creature of the compact. * How , then , can it be a party to that compact , to which it owes its own existence l(k) How can it be said , that it has entered into a contract , when at the time it had no capacity to contract ; and was not even in esse ? If any provision was made for the general government 's becoming a party , and entering into a compact , after it was brought into existence , where is that provision to be found 1 It is not to be found in the constitution itself . Are we at liberty to imply such a provision , attaching to no power given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of im- ( i ) Debate in the senate , in 1830 , on Mr. Foot 's resolution , 4 Elliot 's Debates , 315 to 331. ( k ) Webster 's Speeches , 429 ; 4 Elliot 's Debates , 324. * Most true . It was the result of that compact or agreement between the several states , by which it was ordained and constituted . The government is not the party to the contract . It is , indeed , the creature of it . It is but the servant or agent of the contracting parties . If this servant violates its authority , its aberrations are corrected by various means provided by the instrument . First , the judiciary may pronounce its acts void . Secondly , the people may change their representatives , the states their senators , and the nation its executive . These are the remedies provided by the constitution itself . But it may happen that the wrongs originate with the constituency . One part of the Union persists in what the other thinks oppression .

But this is revolution ; and though the right of revolution is undeniable , it is justified only by extreme cases and serious oppression . It is always an evil , and is an alternative never to be lightly adopted . It is better to " bide our time " and wait for the correction ( in the natural course of things ) of evils that are not intolerable , than to upturn the fabric of society for trifles . If the complaining party has a right to judge , so has the party complained of , and while it holds the mastery , there is no remedy except revolution , or submission to the will of the majority until they can be made to " kick the beam , " in their turn. /z/ plication to an extent truly alarming ; to draw inferences , not from what is , but from what is not , stated in the instrument . But , if any such implication could exist , when did the general government signify its assent to become such a party ? When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government do so , without the express authority of the people ? These are questions , which are more easily asked , than answered . " 369 . In short , the difficulties attendant upon all the various theories under consideration , which treat the constitution of the United States , as a compact , either between the several states , or between the people of the several states , or between . the whole people of the United States , and the people of the several states , or between each citizen of all the states , and all other citizens , are , if not absolutely insuperable , so serious , and so wholly founded upon mere implication , that it is matter of surprise , that they should have been so extensively adopted , and so zealously propagated . These theories , too , seem mainly urged with a view to draw conclusions , which are at war with the known powers , and reasonable objects of the constitution ; and which , if successful , would reduce the government to a mere confederation . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are not justified by the language of the constitution ; secondly , because they have a tendency to impair , and indeed to destroy , its express powers and objects ; and thirdly , because they involve consequences , which , at the will of a single state , may overthrow the constitution itself . One of the fundamental rules in the exposition of every instrument is , so to construe its terms , if possible , as not to make them the source of their own destruction , or to make them utterly void , and nugatory . And if this be generally true , with how much more force does the rule apply to a constitution of government , framed for the general good , and designed for perpetuity ? Surely , if any implications are to be made beyond its terms , they are implications to preserve , and not to destroy it. ( wi ) /z/ " 370 . The cardinal conclusion , for which this doctrine of a compact has been , with so much ingenuity and ability , forced into the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , ) is avowedly to establish , that in construing the constitution , there is no common umpire ; but that each state , nay each department of the government of each state , is the supreme judge for itself , of the powers , and rights , and duties , arising under that instrument. ? ) * Thus , it has been solemnly asserted on more than one occasion , by some of the state legislatures , that there is no common arbiter , or tribunal , authorized to decide in the last resort , upon the powers and the interpretation of the constitution . And the doctrine has been recently revived with extraordinary zeal , and vindicated with uncommon vigour . ( o ) A majority of the states , ment without coercion is a proposition at once so absurd and selfcontradictory , that the idea creates a confusion of the understanding . It is form without substance ; at best a body without a soul . If men would act right , governments of all kinds would be useless . If states or nations , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no wars or disorders in the universe . Bad as individuals are , states are worse .

It is not , then , by artificial reasoning founded upon theory , but upon a careful survey of the language of the constitution itself , that we are to interpret its powers , and its obligations . We are to treat it , as it purports on its face to be , as a constitution of government ; and we are to reject all other appellations , and definitions of it , such , as that it is a compact , especially as they may mislead us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to instruct us in its real objects . " /z/ Having thus presented at length judge Story 's views of the nature of the constitution of the United States , I shall now proceed to a critical examination of some of his positions . The principal foundation upon which they rest , is the assumption that the states are not parties to the constitution ; that it is the act of the people of the United States as a nation ; that it is therefore not a compact , and that our institutions are national not federative . My first duty , therefore , shall be to shew , that these assumptions are not warranted by the history of the transaction . I shall contend 1 . That the formation of the constitution was in its origination , its progress , and its final ratification , the act of the states as free and independent sovereignties , and not of the whole people of America as one people. ( a ) 2 . That if the sovereignty of the states be admitted , no constitution could have been made without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of the states , it is a compact ; a compact to establish a particular form of government or system of polity for the conduct of the external relations of the states , and for some other specified purposes . And first , it was the act of the states as sovereignties , and not of the whole people of America as one people . This proposition affirms , in the first place , that when the constitution of the United States was formed and adopted , the several states of the Union were sovereign and indent ) In the case of Martin v. Hunter , judge Story , for the supreme court , said , that " the constitution of the United States was ordained and established , not by the states in their sovereign capacity , but , emphatically , as the preamble of the constitution declares , by the people of the United States . " I offer as a set-off to this , the remark of the venerable judge Pendleton , in 2 W. 298 , " that though the different states of America form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual sovereignties , and with respect to their municipal laws are to each other foreign . " If their original sovereignties are retained , how could the constitution be formed but bytheir act as a federal compact ? /z/ pendent . The truth of the proposition is abundantly manifest . Whatever may be our speculations on the subject of the relation of the colonies towards each other before or after the declaration of independence , the articles of confederation leave no doubt of the character of its members subsequent to its adoption . In the second section , it is formally declared that each state retains its sovereignty , freedom and independence , so that the clause in effect has the operation of an assertion by each , and an acknowledgment by all , of their respective pretensions to the character of sovereign and independent states . Such being their condition when the articles of confederation were adopted , the confederation itself was nothing but a league between sovereign powers , in which , no power not expressly delegated , was possessed by the league , but every power , jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states . The league was declared to be perpetual and unalterable , except by the consent of every state : and it was ratified and signed by the delegates of the several states who " solemnly plighted and engaged the faith of their respective constituents the states ) for its observance . " The league thus made , having been declared to be perpetual , could only have been properly dissolved by those who made it ; i. e. by the states , as sovereignties , by whose authority it had been adopted . Accordingly , when in 1786 , as we have already seen , the difficulties and embarrassments of the existing state of things , suggested the absolute necessity of a change , certain commissioners were appointed by the legislature of the state of Virginia , one of the sovereign parties to the confederacy , to meet other commissioners from the other states , for the purpose of proposing amendments to the confederation . These commissioners were agents and representatives of the respective state sovereignties , and acted as such ; each delegation acting for itself , voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote of its state . ( 6 ) The representatives of the five states who assembled , recommended to congress , the appointment ( with the assent of the states ) of a convention to meet at Philadelphia . What was congress ? It ( b ) See 1 L. U. S. 55. /z/ was an assembly of states , by their separate and distinct delegations , without a single trait of national government . Their action was of course state action . They did recommend the appointment of delegates by the states to a general convention of the states in Philadelphia . The states accordingly ,  --  aye , the very legislatures themselves , representing the state sovereignty ,  --  appointed delegates with separate commissions and instructions . The people had no agency in this , except through their legislatures . Thus far , then , all is clearly state action . The convention met . Of whom was it composed ? Of delegates representing the states through the state legislatures . Having thus met as delegates of state sovereignties , could they put off that character and assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or people ? They could not , neither did they attempt it . On the contrary , they acted throughout as the representatives of separate state sovereignties . They voted throughout by states . The delegates from each state voted together , and the majority of the delegation gave the vote of the state . Nor was this all . Every measure was decided by the majority of states , not of individual votes . Every state had an equal weight in this great council of sovereigns . The dwarf and the giant were upon an equality . Delaware and Pennsylvania , Georgia and New York  --  all were equal , for all were sovereigns ; and in the estimate of the law of nations , every sovereign has equal rights with others . In all these proceedings , we see not a single feature of nationality , but every distinctive characteristic of state action . The delegates had been appointed for states , they acted accordingly for states , and they voted by states . Even by states they voted upon the final adoption of the constitution . In what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In what character only could it have been done ? Could it have been done in any other character than as representatives of the states ? Could they lawfully put off the character given them and throw up their commissions , and yet continue to act , and to act in another character ? Could they not only put off the character they held , but also assume the character of representatives of the people , by whom they were not appointed , and even of the whole people of the Union , with a large portion of whom they had no sort /z/ of communion . It would have been rank usurpation , and the act would have been void , as totally destitute of authority . Of this they did not dream . They signed the draft of the constitution as an act of the states . The attestation is , " Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present " and each delegation signed separately and apart from the others . What then becomes of the pretence , that " We the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one whole , and not the people of each state with the people of the other states ? What justifies the assertion , that " the constitution was ordained and established " not by the states in their sovereign capacities , " but emphatically as the preamble of the constitution declares , " by the people of the United States ? " If this was the meaning of the words " We the people of the United States , " in the constitution , then , as I have already said , the whole act was an usurpation , since the delegates were not empowered to act but for the states in their sovereign capacities . Shall we , then , by a forced construction , attribute to the delegates an action in a character which they did not possess , and which in no other part of their proceedings they appear to have arrogated ? Shall we gratuitously attribute to them usurpation , when the language used by them , is as fairly applicable to the character they really filled ? Shall we suppose that the whole convention nem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition to that effect , agreed to put off the character that really belonged to them , and to usurp one that did not , and that at the head of these was the patriot Washington , the president of the convention , and deputy from Virginia ? Credat judcrus appella , non ego ! It is of no little importance in the consideration of the import of these words , to remark upon the received meaning of the words United States , at the time of the adoption of the constitution . Did those words , in common acceptation , or , according to technical use or philological accuracy , mean one people or thirteen sovereignties ? There is little reason to doubt that , in common parlance , " United States " implied the several political bodies which had united for common defence . Such is its true meaning philologically , for when we speak of things united , we imply a previous separation of the parts . But what is /z/ conclusive , the words are used in the articles of confederation itself , not as indicating oneness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first article declares that " The style of the confederacy shall be the United States of America , " while in the very next , the separate sovereignty of each state is anxiously secured . " United States , " therefore , does not mean one people , but several peoples united , and in this sense must the delegates appointed under that confederation have used the language . For where known words are used , to which a distinct meaning has attached , the accustomed interpretation of them must be followed ; and , as under the confederation , the words " United States " could not imply one whole , because the parts were kept distinct , so the same words can not , in the constitution , mean one whole , but the several parts . " We , the people of the United States , " therefore , means " We , the people of the several states composing this confederacy , " and not " We , the people of the United States constituting one people . " In the former sense it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , for when they used those words they were acting under the confederacy , and used them as used in the articles themselves ; but it is altogether unnatural , that in speaking of an act done while the confederacy still subsisted , they should use expressions which implied its obliteration at the moment of their use . They could not , with truth , speak of the people as one whole in the act of forming the constitution ; for they were then thirteen distinct states under the confederation , and even if they became one , by the adoption of the constitution , they were not one in the act of its formation . Let us proceed . After the adoption of the plan of the constitution by the convention , that body again met ; " present , the states of New Hampshire , " &,c.; ( enumerating them , ) and resolved that the constitution should be laid before congress , and afterwards submitted to a convention of delegates , chosen in each state by the people thereof , under the recommendation of its legislature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in the ratification , to be a separate action of each state , under the recommendation of its regularly constituted organ . And the reason why it was referred to the people for adoption , /z/ and not to the legislatures , was that before given , and strongly stated by judge Story himself , vol. 1 , p. 330 . The ordinary legislatures having been empowered merely to administer the state constitutions , such as they were , had no power to enlarge or limit their own powers by transferring them to another , and still less to give away the powers of the state without its authority . But what were the conventions thus formed ? They came directly from , and did , beyond question , represent the people . But what people ? The people of the state as a sovereign state , or a part of the people of the United States , considered as one whole ? Undoubtedly the former , for the ratification was to be by states . Each state convention met separately , acted separately , adopted separately . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . It could not be otherwise . The states were still sovereign . They were still in the bonds of the confederacy . These could only be thrown off , as I have already said , by state action , since the states themselves had imposed them . All this is rendered beyond question , by the ratifications of the respective conventions . These ratifications , in almost every instance , distinctly evince state action on the part of the conventions . They are too important to the question before us to be entirely omitted . Short extracts follow : Delaware . We , the deputies of the people of Delaware state , &c,; &,c,; in virtue of the power and authority to us given , for and in behalf of ourselves and our constituents , do ratify and confirm , &,c.; Pennsylvania .

The ratifications evince , beyond question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented its own state only , and assented to the plan of government in the name and behalf of the people thereof It can never be too much regretted that the able commentator , whose work is destined to be so much the manual of our youth , should , in his account of the ratifications by the states , have omitted this important fact , which takes away the whole force of the argument so much insisted on as to the first words of the constitution . It is contended , that , as the convention has used the language " We the people of the United States , " the act was in the /z/ name and behalf of the whole people , and not " of the people of the respective states ; " whereas all the ratifications being , in fact , in the name and behalf of the respective states , the last clinching act done by conventions , acting distinctly for the people of each state alone , establishes , beyond question , that the constitution is the act of the states as such , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one people . Nothing then is wanting to refute the positions that the constitution " was not ordained and established by the states in their sovereign capacities , " and " that the states were not the parties to the instrument . " For if the states had not ratified it , the projet would have been defeated ; and as it was ratified by states or conventions , in the name and in behalf of states who were then at least sovereign , it must derive its whole vigour , force and effect from the action of those sovereign states themselves . The considerations which go to establish this view of the matter are abounding . Among others , we ought not to omit some provisions on the face of the constitution itself . Thus it is provided , that the legislatures of the states may propose amendments , and that amendments , when proposed , shall be adopted by legislatures or conventions of three fourths of the states  --  not three fourths of the whole population of the United States ; thus distinctly shewing that the sovereignties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such upon the principles of national law . On what other principle could we justify the election of a president by the house of representatives  --  " that great Procrustes bed , The acknowledged work of huckstering compromise ; On which the sov'reign states are prostrate laid And stretched or clipped to the same common size : Where the leviathan with all its pride , Shrinks to a minnow ; or the pigmy fay Grown to a giant , with important stride , And new born power struts its hour away , Then shrinks again its humbler part to play . " Again , how is it , if this was a national government , and one " not ordained by the states , " that only those states were bound who ratified ? Why , as in all national governments , did not the majority prevail and bind the rest ? Why , as in all federal compacts , were none bound but /z/ those who ratified ? Why , but because it was a government of federative character ? New states formed out of old states , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union . In what character 1 And in what character do they come under the obligations of the constitution ? As states . Could a portion of the people , who had not formed a government , and erected themselves into a state , enter the union ? Assuredly not ; for they could have no representative in the senate , as they would have no legislature to elect one . Thus , so far from not being a government of states , it is a government which can only subsist by states and to which states alone are parties . A person charged with treason against any state , and fleeing from justice , shall be delivered up . Treason , then , the crimen Icbscb majistatis , can be committed against a state ; it is , therefore , conceded by the constitution itself to be sovereign ; and if sovereign , it can only be bound by its own act and consent . It must then be a party to the constitution , or the constitution has no existence . The inhibitions upon the exercise of powers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all admissions of state sovereignty . That section restrains the exercise of sovereign powers which did belong to the states , but which they have consented to forego for the public good . The citizens of each state are secured the privileges of citizens in every other . Evidences might be further multiplied , derived from the " face of the constitution " itself , of the admitted sovereignty of the states , and of the fact that they were the contracting parties in the formation of the government . It was ordained and established by the people , indeed , but by the people of the several communities constituting separate and distinct states . It was the work of thirteen lesser sovereignties , and not of one great sovereignty . The thirteen states have never yet been fused into one common mass . There is no act by which the people of them respectively have put off their separate sovereignty , and been melted into one whole . They still retain that sovereignty , and are , and have ever been in the actual exercise of it , except so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain powers to the government of the United States . All other powers are reserved to the /z/ states respectively , or to the people ; a significant expression , denoting a continued distinctness of the several sovereignties composing this great confederacy . I have not thought it necessary in this examination of the character of the government to array the arguments of the authors of the Federalist on the subject , demonstrating that the constitution of the United States is partly national and partly federal ; since they have been so recently the subject of your studies , as to be fresh in your recollections . But it would be improper not to advert to the letter of the convention to congress , in which it is declared " to be obviously impracticable in the federal government of these states " ( still recognizing their political character ) " to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each , and yet provide for the interest and safety of all . Individuals entering into society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest . " And so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of independent sovereignty to secure the residue . But it is obvious , from the whole letter , that the convention looked upon their act as the act of the states , and not of individuals . " The constitution , " says the Federalist , " is founded indeed , on the assent and ratification of the people of America , given by delegates elected for the special purpose : but this assent and ratification is to be given by the whole people , not as individuals composing one entire nation , but as composing the distinct and independent states , to which they respectively belong . It is to be the assent and ratification of the several states , derived from the supreme authority in each state , the people themselves . The act , therefore , establishing the constitution will NOT BE A NATIONAL , BUT A FEDERAL ACT . " Such is the language of the Federalist , ( c ) written pending the controversies respecting the constitution , to reconcile the people to the plan of government , and to remove among others , the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its character . In like manner , one of the authors of those papers , at a later date , tells us that the constitution of the United States " was not formed by a majority of the people of the United States , as a single community , in the manner of a consolidated government . It was formed ( c ) No. 39. /z/ by the states , that is , by the people in each of the states , acting in their highest sovereign capacity , and formed consequently by the same authority which formed the state constitutions. " ( r/ ) With these prominent evidences before him , it is truly remarkable that judge Story should have ventured on the assertion , ( e ) that although the opponents of the constitution , on many occasions , pressed the objection that it was a consolidated government , and contrasted it with a confederative , yet none of its advocates pretended to deny that its design was to establish a national government , as contradistinguished from a mere league or treaty , however they might oppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The passage already quoted from the Federalist proves that those papers alleged it " not to be a national but a federal act . " And Mr. Madison , an advocate for the constitution in the Virginia convention , ( f ) obviously using the word " consolidated " as " national , " observes , " I conceive , myself , the government is of a mixed nature . In some respects it is of a federal nature , in others it is of a consolidated nature . Who are parties to it ? The people ; but not the people as composing one great body , but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties . " And if this be so , how can the government be otherwise than the act of the states as distinct sovereignties ? " If , " he continues , " it were a consolidated " i. e. national " government , the assent of a majority of the people would be sufficient for its establishment , ) and as a majority of the whole people of the United States have adopted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of that majority , even if they unanimously reprobated it , and it would be now binding on this state without its having had the privilege of deliberation on it : but as it is , no ( d ) Mr. Madison 's letter , quoted 1 Story 334. ( e ) Pa. 325. ( / ) Debates ' 76. ( g ) And so now for its abolition . But who will admit this power in the majority of the people of the Union , to abrogate by their voices this constitution , ordained and established by states ? Who will admit that the unanimous vote of three fourths of the population of the whole United States , can abrogate , or even alter the constitution , without the assent of three fourths of the states themselves in their political capacity ? /z/ state is bound by it , without its own consent . Should all the states adopt it , it will then be a government established by the thirteen states of America , not through the intervention of the legislatures , but by the people at large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition , that if the states were sovereign at the time of the adoption of the constitution of the United States , no constitution could have been made ( without the assent of those sovereignties ) / ? ) They are consequently parties to it . And here it may be necessary to refer to the well known distinction between the ordinary legislature , and the sovereignty in each state . The legislature is not the sovereign power , though it represents it in the matters committed to its authority . The people of each state is the sovereign power of that state ; and the proposition therefore means that no constitution for the Union could have been adopted without the assent of the people of each state , as distinct and independent sovereignties . Such they were under the confederation , which recognized and declared the fact , if it could have been reasonably doubted before . But they would not have been sovereign , if the people of the rest of the Union could have bound them without their own assent . Now , if their assent was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the constitution is the result of state action ; it is the creature of the states , and the states are consequently the parties to it . 3 . If the constitution be the result of state action , and if the states are parties to it , the constitution is a compact . And this seems sufficiently obvious , since the only method by which joint action between several states can take place , is compact or agreement . What then was the compact or agreement between the thirteen states in the adoption of the constitution ? I have already intimated the opinion , that the form or system of government was rather the result of the compact , than the compact itself . The compart is to be found in the first clause , by which it was agreed between the states to establish a particular form of government . This was a compact between the states with each other , and not between ( A ) See Upshur 's Review , 58 . There is no power to change a government except the power which formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to administer the proposed government . These are but their agents , and their illegal acts are to be corrected by the remedies prescribed by the constitution . An attention to this distinction will relieve us from much difficulty hereafter in considering some interesting questions . After this tedious examination , I shall close these remarks on this part of our subject , with a further extract from judge Upshur 's masterly discussion of it : " The third division of the work commences with a history of the adoption of the constitution . This , also , is given in an abridged form ; but it omits nothing which can be considered material to the enquiry . Perhaps the author has fallen into one error , an unimportant one , certainly , in stating that , ' at the time and place appointed , the representatives of twelve states assembled . ' When the deputies first met in Philadelphia , in May 1787 , the representatives of only nine states appeared ; they were , soon after , joined by those of three others . The author next proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , with the replies thereto ; to examine the nature of that instrument ; to ascertain whether it be a compact or not ; to enquire who is the final judge or interpreter in constitutional controversies ; to lay down rules of interpretation ; and , finally , to examine the constitution in its several departments and separate clauses . In the execution of this part of his task , he has displayed great research , laborious industry , and extensive judicial learning . The brief summary which he has given of the arguments by which the constitution was assailed on the one hand , and defended on the other , is not only interesting as matter of history , but affords great aid in understanding that instrument . We should be careful , however , not to attach to these discussions an undue importance . All the members of the various conventions , did not engage in the debates , and , of course , we have no means of determining by what process of reasoning they were led to their conclusions . And we can not reasonably suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed opinions in all the arguments , direct and collateral , by which they sought to achieve a single great pur-/z/ i62 LECTURES ON pose . We are not , therefore , to consider the constitution as the one thing or the other , merely because some of the fiamers , or some of the adopters of it , chose so to characterize it in their debates . Their arguments are valuable as guides to our judgments , but not as authority to bind them . " In the interpretation of the constitution , the author founds himself , whenever he can , upon the authority of the supreme court . This was to be expected ; for , in so doing , he has , in most cases , only reiterated his own judicial decisions . We could not suppose that one , whose opinions are not lightly adopted , would advance , as a commentator , a principle which he rejected as a judge . In most cases , too , no higher authority in the interpretation of the constitution is known in our systems , and none better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political power , involving the rights of the states in reference to the federal government , that any class of politicians are disposed to deny the authority of the judgments of the supreme court . We shall have occasion to examine this subject more at large , in a subsequent part of this review . * ' In discussing the various clauses of the constitution , the author displays great research , and a thorough acquaintance with the history of that instrument . It is not perceived , however , that he has presented any new views of it , or offered any new arguments in support of the constructions which it has heretofore received . As a compendium of what others have said and done upon the subject , his work is very valuable . It facilitates investigation , whilst , at the same time , it is so full of matter , as to render little farther investigation necessary . Even in this view of the subject , however , it would have been much more valuable , if it had contained references to the authorities on which its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
