Jerry Oltion says he has always felt a kinship with W. C. Fields in large part because of the famous tribute given him by Leo C. Rosters : " Anyone who hates kids and dogs ca n't be all bad . " Or was it " babies and dogs " ? Tracking down some of these quotations can be vexing . Let 's just say this story demonstrates once again Groucho Marx 's wisdom in noting that " Outside of a dog , a book is a man 's best friend . Inside of a dog , it 's too dark too read . " <p> SHELBY WAS TRIMMING THE roses in front of his new house when the dog attacked . He did n't realize that 's what it was doing at first . It was just a little mop of gray fur that bounced up and down with every shrill bark , and the way it lunged forward and darted back he could n't tell whether it was coming or going . Only when Shelby saw the snout full of needle-sharp teeth sticking out from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . He burst out laughing . That sent the dog into an even wilder frenzy , barking nonstop and leaping into the air as if it would rip out his throat if only it could reach that high . " Hey , " Shelby said . " Hey , cut it out . Go away . " He brandished his pruning shears at it , but the dog merely danced out of range and kept barking . It had an annoying overtone to its voice , a high-pitched squeak that pierced the ears like feedback through a microphone . Shelby stood up and looked over the low rose hedge . Nobody walked along the sidewalk . No cars moved down the street . Nobody else was out in their yards . So where had the dog come from ? And how had it gotten into his yard anyway ? There was a picket fence all along the front of the roses , and a gate at the walk . This little thing was too small to have jumped over . " Come on , shut up , " Shelby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " He walked over and opened the gate for it . The dog stood its ground and barked . Shelby aimed a little kick at it , not even intending to hit it , just scare it off . But it growled a surprisingly deep growl , and its fur fluffed out until it looked twice as big as before . " Whoa , take it easy . " Shelby backed up a step . How had it done that ? It actually seemed bigger , and much more ferocious than before . He watched in amazement as it shrank back down now that he was n't threatening it anymore . Its voice even rose in pitch again . He bent down cautiously and tried the opposite approach . Somewhat timidly now , he stretched out his hand toward it and said , " Calm down already . Nobody 's going to hurt you . Let 's see if you 've got a tag , okay ? " The dog barked a few more times , but Shelby kept his hand outstretched and it finally stopped . It edged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked some more . " Oh , for crying out loud . " Shelby twitched his fingers as if he might have a treat for it . He was n't much of a dog person ; he had no idea if that would really work , but it was apparently the right thing to do . The dog came forward to sniff again , and this time it let him touch it , then scratch behind its ears . Its hair was soft , and its body felt warm when he got down to actual skin . Something - an air molecule on the nose , maybe - set it off again a moment later , but Shelby had already felt that it was n't wearing a collar . Well , once it got tired of barking at him it would probably find its own way home . Shelby decided to give it that opportunity , so he took his pruning shears inside the house , leaving the front gate open for the dog to exit through . From the living room window he watched it trot around the yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gatepost . He rattled the door when it hesitated in the open gateway , but instead of running off , it trotted up the walk and barked at the door . Shelby opened it and shouted , " Go away ! " but the dog darted between his feet and pranced into the living room as if it lived there . Maybe it did , Shelby thought . He had only owned the house for a week . The previous owner , a widow in her nineties , had died of old age , and her only living relative , a nephew who lived in France , had put the house up for sale through a local real estate agency without even coming to look at it . It would be easy enough to find out if she had had a dog . The neighbors would know . The woman had apparently been a recluse , but something this yappy would n't be easy to miss even if she kept it inside most of the time . Shelby watched it jump up on his couch . The real estate agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house - and all the woman 's other possessions as well-but that did n't seem to affect the dog any . It turned around a couple of times and settled down on the right-hand cushion , looking more like a fuzzy pillow than a dog . He 'd been about to chase it out , but he supposed this was as good a place for it as any , at least until he figured out whose it was . It did n't look like it would do any harm on the couch . So he left it there and went over to the neighbors on his left . He had n't met them yet , but they were usually home during the day , and today was no exception . The husband , a big man in his sixties or so , answered the door . " Hi , " he said . " You 're the new guy . I 'm Bill . Welcome to the neighborhood . " He held out his right hand . Shelby realized his hands were still scratched and dirty from pruning roses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his right hand to show why he did n't shake . " I 'm Shelby . I was out in my yard just now , and this dog came by . Little gray mop-dog . It seems to think it lives in my house . I was wondering if you knew who it belonged to . " The neighbor scratched his head through his white crewcut . " Gray mop-dog ? Nope , do n't remember seeing one of them around here . And I know Marlene did n't have a dog . Hang on a sec . " He turned his head and shouted into the house , " Honey , you know anybody around here with a little gray dog ? " His wife , also white-haired and smiling , came to the door and said , " No , I do n't . " She proceeded to tell Shelby about every dog in the neighborhood , and from there she delved into the children , and she was well into the parents " lives before Shelby heard barking from inside his house and said , " Uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better go . " He was too late . The dog had apparently gotten up from the couch the moment he left , because it would have needed all the time it had to trash out his living room so thoroughly . Books had been pulled from bookcases , chairs had been tipped over , the computer keyboard and mouse dangled off the edge of the table by their cords - and the ultimate insult waited right square in the middle of the carpet : a glistening pile of wet brown dog poop , amazingly large for such a small animal , and stinking up the entire room . " Jesus H. Christ , dog ! " Shelby shouted when he saw what it had done . " Out ! " He kicked at it for real this time , caught it with the side of his foot , and scooted it toward the door . It growled its oddly ferocious growl and started to fluff up again , but Shelby reached over it and flung open the screen door , then booted it right on outside . It stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he slammed the screen and the main door as well . It kept on barking while he cleaned up the pile of turds . When he opened the back door to go toss them in the dumpster , the dog raced around the house and tried to get in that way , but Shelby snatched up a broom by the door and held it at bay while he disposed of its mess . He actually had to whack it on the head to make it back off enough for him to get into his house again . It swelled up to amazing proportions , and its menacing growl sent shivers up his spine . He laughed , but it was a nervous laugh . Besieged by a lap dog ! It would be hilarious if it were n't happening to him . He spent the next half hour trying to ignore it while he cleaned up his living room . The dog barked for the first few minutes , then quieted down and scratched at the door a while , then just as Shelby was about to call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows , careful not to show more of himself than he had to lest the dog see him and renew its efforts , but he could n't see it anywhere . He wondered if he should go outside and close the gate , but he decided to wait a while . The dog might still be in his yard , hiding next to the house or something . Shelby would give it plenty of time to get bored and wander off . Besides , the gate had n't kept it out the first time . He 'd have to go look for holes in the fence tomorrow . The dog stayed quiet for a couple of hours , but after dark , when Shelby was just settling in for an evening 's reading , it started barking again . He slapped his Stephen King novel down on the coffee table , went over to the bar between the living room and the kitchen where he kept the phone , and looked up the animal control center in the book . When he dialed their number , though , all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try again tomorrow , in an emergency please call the veterinary hospital or the police . He felt foolish calling the police about a barking dog . To heck with it ; he could put up with it for one night and call the pound in the morning if it was still hanging around . He sat back down in his living room and tried to read again , but the constant barking was so distracting he could n't make sense of the words . He switched on the TV and watched a documentary on sharks , but even with the volume up he could hear the lunatic dog outside the whole time . He was about to try earplugs when the dog burst into an even wilder frenzy of barking , and a few seconds later there was a timid knock on the door . He went to open it , and saw his white-haired neighbor , Bill , standing on the step , the dog nipping at his heels . " You found out who owns it ? " Shelby asked hopefully . Bill shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to ask if you could maybe let it in for the night . It 's keeping the whole neighborhood awake . " " It tore up my living room last time I let it in , " Shelby said . " Hmm . Yeah . Well , I 'd offer to take it , but Phyllis is allergic . We 've got to do something , though . " Shelby thought it was pretty charitable of the guy to say " we , " but it was pretty clear he meant " you " even so . The dog was , after all , barking on Shelby 's doorstep . " I guess I should call the cops , " Shelby said . " Cops ? Hah ! " said his neighbor . " You have n't lived here long , have you ? Unless there 's drugs involved or somebody 's being murdered , you might as well forget the cops . They 'll never show up for a barking dog . " Shelby nodded . He 'd figured as much . That was part of the reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He clearly had to do something , though . He could see faces in windows across the street as his other neighbors checked out the commotion in his yard . Great . He was going to get a reputation as a troublemaker right from the start . There was no winning this one . Sighing , Shelby opened the door , and the dog shot inside and rushed into the middle of the living room , where it continued to bark , jumping up and down as it did . " Thanks , " Bill said , turning to go . " Do me a favor and ask across the street before you go home , would you ? " Shelby asked him . " See if somebody might have a visitor or something he belongs to . " Bill hesitated , clearly wishing he could just go home , but at last he nodded and said , " Sure , okay . " There , Shelby thought as he closed the door . At least more of the neighbors would learn the story and not blame him for the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it saw it had his attention . " You 're a pain in the ass , you know that , little dog ? " It hung its head and whimpered , a comical gesture of appeasement except Shelby did n't believe for a second that there was enough brain in its head to entertain the concept . " I guess you need a name , " he told it . " Not that a name means I 'm going to keep you , understand . " He rubbed his chin , thinking , then said , " I think I 'll call you " Lunch . " Just so you wo n't get the wrong idea . " He supposed Lunch might need lunch itself , and probably water , too , especially if it had been lost long , so he went into the kitchen and got a cereal bowl , filled it from the tap , and set it on the floor . Lunch sniffed it , barked at it a time or two , then lapped at the water . " I do n't have any dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator and looked for something a dog might eat . Leftover pizza ? Why not . He set a slice on a plate and microwaved it for a few seconds , then put it down on the floor . Lunch sniffed , barked , then turned away and went back into the living room . " Fine , " Shelby told it . " It 'll be there when you get hungry . Cold and slimy , but it 'll be there . " The dog trotted right to the couch and settled down on the same cushion it had curled up on before . Shelby watched it for a moment , waiting for it to go berserk and tear up his living room again , but it lowered its head to its paws and stared back at him from under its bushy brows . Shelby backed away down the hall , keeping his eye on the dog until he got to the door to the spare bedroom . He had n't moved much of his stuff into it yet ; he hurriedly hauled what few boxes he had put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the carpet and brought in the pizza and the water . The dog itself proved problematic , growling softly when Shelby reached for it , but he was n't about to let it run loose in his house all night . He petted it for a minute , then gently picked it up and carried it into the bedroom . It felt heavier than he 'd expected . Maybe it was n't all fur after all . " Here you go , " he told it . " Home for the night . If you need anything , do n't bother to ask , okay ? " He set the dog down and quickly closed the door . It immediately started barking again , but he shouted through the door at it , " Shut up , dog , or I 'll name you Midnight Snack . " That actually did the trick . It whimpered a time or two , and Shelby heard it walking around on the newspaper , but after a minute or so he heard a rustle and a thump as it settled down . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed himself . OF COURSE IT WAS too good to last . In the middle of the night - Shelby reached groggily for the clock and saw that it was past two A.M. - he heard ferocious barking from the spare bedroom , barking that grew deeper in pitch with every breath , and then a loud crash and the sound of splintering wood . " Dammit , dog , what now ? " Shelby threw off the covers and stalked into the hall in his shorts , switched on the light - and stared in shock at the door that had been ripped to shreds . It had exploded outward , the bottom half of it forced right past the jamb by some incredible force . Pieces of veneer still swayed back and forth from whatever had done it . The whatever had to be Lunch . Shelby heard its throaty growl coming from the living room now . He slipped back into his own bedroom , snatched up the baseball bat that he kept by his bed for protection , and walked cautiously down the hallway with it cocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called softly . " What 's the matter , boy ? " " Call him off ! " a panicked voice shouted . " Call him off ! " Shelby flipped on the living room light and saw a man dressed all in black , with a full-face stocking cap over his head , backed into the comer between the living room and the kitchen bar by He blinked a few times to make sure he was really seeing okay . The creature hardly resembled a dog . It had long gray hair all over its body , and it stood on four legs , but it was as big as a grizzly bear . Its jaws looked big enough to crack an elephant femur , and the creature looked eager to try them out on the man in black . " Lunch ? " Shelby asked again . " Lunch , dinner , whatever you like . I 'll even pick up the tab , " the intruder said quickly . " Just call him off . " " That 's his name , " Shelby explained . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a strange man and an even stranger dog in his house and he felt the need to take command of the situation somehow , he said , " Heel , boy . Just hold him there . " Incredibly , Lunch backed up a step and growled again , deep in his massive throat . Shelby kept his bat cocked back . He felt ridiculous standing there in his shorts with a slavering were-creature and a masked robber in his living room . Ridiculous and scared . But not as scared as the other guy , whose eyes never left Lunch . He backed up a step . " I , um , I think I 'll be going now . " " Oh no you do n't . You just stay right there while I call the cops , and we 'll - " " The cops ? " The man seemed even more startled by that than by Lunch . " You bust into my house in the middle of the night , of course I 'm going to call the cops . What did you expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead through the right eyehole in his mask . " To tell you the truth , I was hoping to find the place empty . At the worst I thought I might find somebody new here , but I hoped I could do my business and be gone without waking " em up . I sure as ... well , I did n't expect to find her familiar still here . " " Her familiar ? " Shelby knew what a familiar was ; he had just never dreamed they might actually exist . Or that he 'd have one in his own house , holding an intruder at bay . But there was no arguing with a creature the size of the one that drooled messily on his floor right in front of him . Or with the guy in black , who carried a big knife in a scabbard at his waist , now that Shelby looked closer . Maybe old Lunch was n't as bad to have around as he 'd thought . The man in black sighed and pulled off his face mask . He looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I should have known she would n't let it go even when she died . Damn , damn , damn . I 'm screwed . You might as well just sic " im on me and get it over with . " Lunch edged forward as if he liked that idea , but Shelby said , " Back . Screwed how ? What 's going on ? " " You really do n't know ? " " All I know is that this dog showed up today and would n't go away . And now you 're here . I assume that 's more than just a coincidence . " " Probably . I would n't put it past her to keep some kind of snoop on me . Probably knew I was coming the moment I knew it myself . " Shelby was growing tired of standing there with his bat over his shoulder and asking dumb questions . " How about you just hand me that knife real gentle-like , and then tell me what this is all about , " he said . The man unsnapped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding it out cautiously by the blade while Lunch growled at him . Lunch 's voice sounded like a diesel locomotive in a tunnel now . Shelby took the knife in his left hand , then stood back and lowered his bat . " Talk , " he said . The man swallowed . " It 's a long story . I 'm not exactly proud of it , either . I stole something of hers once . You know what a grimoire is ? " " Spellbook , " Shelby said . " Yeah . So you do know about this sort of thing . " " I 've read about it , " Shelby said . " I do n't practice . " He almost laughed . He 'd never until tonight believed it was even possible . " Neither do I. But the guy who hired me did . And so did the woman who used to live here . He wanted her grimoire . I got it for him , too . And she cursed me for it . " " How ? " asked Shelby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She .. you 're going to think I 'm nuts . Mind if I go ahead and show you ? " " What are you going to do ? " " Just pick up a book . You got one you do n't particularly care about ? " Shelby narrowed his eyes . What was this guy going to do with it ? He looked at his shelves full of books , books he never loaned out because he did n't want them to come back to him with broken spines or dog-eared pages . Then he saw the telephone book on the bar between the kitchen and the living room , just to the right of the intruder . That would do . And it was big enough and floppy enough that the guy could n't use it for a weapon . " There , " he said , pointing with the knife . " The phone book . " " Right . " The man picked it up , opened it in the middle , and held it in his hands as if he were going to read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growled and lunged forward . " Heel ! " Shelby yelled , and the dog reluctantly backed off . The man in black slapped the phone book closed , snuffing out the flames and spewing ash out in front of him , then set it back on the counter . " I ca n't read a book , " he said . " The moment I open it up , the pages catch fire . " " Wow , " Shelby said . " Wow ? I ca n't read a damned word and you say " Wow ' ? Look , pal , I was in college when she laid this on me . That was twenty years ago . I was going to be a journalist . I heard about this occult group in town and thought I 'd get a cool story out of it , and the next thing I know I 'm flunking out . Could n't keep a job " cause I kept starting fires every time I 'd try to read a manual , and even when I finally did find work that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And forget reading for pleasure . If it were n't for billboards and books on tape I 'd be a basket case . " " Sorry , " Shelby said . He really was . The idea of not being able to read scared him more than anything else he 'd seen that night . " So what were you hoping to do here ? They auctioned off all her stuff before I got the house . " " I know . I bought the whole damned load of it . Bunch of crap , too . I spent the last three weeks going through all of it for the talisman that keeps the spell active , but it was n't there . So I figured it had to be in the house . " " Is it ? " " I do n't know . Your damned familiar nabbed me the minute I came in the window . " " Oh . Back off , Lunch . " The slavering creature stepped backward , muscles rippling along its flanks and legs as it moved . " Bear in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrong move , " Shelby told the man , sounding a good deal more confident than he felt , " but go ahead and look around . " The man sidled carefully around Lunch , looking at the living room . " The place was completely bare when you moved in ? " he asked . " Bare , and freshly painted . They even had the attic cleaned out and reinsulated , so there 's nothing up there , either . " " It 's got to be here , though . Maybe under the floor or in the walls , or ... " his voice trailed off as he held his hands out in front of him , then slowly turned full circle . " I can feel it , " he said . He stepped over to the bookcase beside the couch . " Here . " " No , that 's mine . " " Behind it , then . " He swept his hands around in a circle in front of the shelves , and said , " Oh yeah . They 're tingling like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved his arms some more , slowly outlining a shape in the air . A five  --  pointed star . " Pentagram , " Shelby said . " Sure looks like it . Here , help me move the bookcase . " Shelby hesitated . What if this guy was lying to him ? He 'd seen the pages in the phone book burst into flame , sure , but that did n't necessarily mean the rest of it was true . Lunch growled , as if suddenly troubled by Shelby 's doubts . There was n't much arguing with him , at least . Something weird was definitely going on , and this guy had the best explanation Shelby had heard yet . He tossed the knife down the hallway to get it out of the way in case there was a struggle , and keeping the baseball bat , he walked over to the bookshelf and together he and the intruder wiggled it out from the wall . " This is it , " the guy said , running his hands over the blank white space . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " So what do we do to turn it off ? " Shelby asked . " I have n't got a clue . " Shelby turned to the dog . " Lunch ? " Lunch barked . A rottweiler would have wet itself , hearing it . " Shush ! The neighbors already hate me ! " He turned back to the wall and said to the man in black , " Stand back . " " What are you going to do ? " " Well , they talk about " breaking a spell . " Let 's see if it 's a literal expression . " Shelby swung the bat at the wall . He was appalled that he would even think of doing such a thing to his own house , but the night had grown so strange that smashing a wall seemed minor compared to what had already happened . His whole arm vibrated when the bat hit , but a crack appeared in the pebbly surface . Shelby swung harder and knocked a chunk of plaster loose this time . A dark line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see a couple legs of the pentagram . He smashed at them again and again until they were completely obliterated . A crackling sound filled the air . Blue light flashed out from the wall , leaving afterimages in Shelby 's eyes , and a howl like a jet engine shook the room . For a moment it seemed as if the house might actually lift off , but the shaking subsided and the howl slowly dropped in pitch as the source of the sound swirled up through the roof and out into the night . Shelby lowered his bat . Too strange , too strange . But ... " Here , " he said , picking a book at random from the case they had just moved and tossing it to the man . He opened it up , and Shelby saw he had picked Firestarter . Oops . But the book did n't burst into flame when the man looked at the pages . " I can read it ! " he said . " I can read it ! " " Go ahead and borrow it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't break the spine , and - " The man set it down as if it had just grown fangs . " I 'll , uh , I 'll buy my own copy . " He laughed a hysterical laugh . " By God , I 'll march right into a bookstore and buy my own copy ! Ha ha ! " He turned toward the window , then looked back to Shelby . " Thank you , " he said . " Do n't mention it , " Shelby told him . " You want to use the door ? " " Oh . Sure . Look , I 'll pay for the wall . " " Forget it . Let 's just scoot the shelf back over the hole and call it a night . They did that , then the man left by the front door , still thanking Shelby profusely . Lunch had already begun to shrink again - the familiar was down to collie size now - but the man refrained from petting it on his way out . Shelby closed the door behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into a furry mop dog . " Okay , " he said . " I guess you were just doing your job , but now you can go back to wherever you came from . I do n't think that guy will be back . " Lunch just jumped up and down and barked . Shelby sat down on the couch and surveyed his house . The spare bedroom door was a total loss , and there was a pile of plaster fragments and dust around the base of the bookcase . Otherwise he had gotten off pretty easy for his first brush with magic . And apparently he had a familiar now , too . He shook his head . It was really , really late . He did n't think he could sleep after all that had happened , but he leaned back on the couch and closed his eyes , and a few minutes later he proved himself wrong . In the morning he saw that Lunch had been busy . Books lay scattered everywhere , Shelby 's running shoes had been chewed to little plastic shreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of them all . " Lunch ! " Shelby yelled . The dog skittered into the living room from the kitchen , a Chips Ahoy sack over its head . Shelby laughed . But he got up and went to the kitchen divider , where he opened the phone book - thanking his luck that the scorched part was at the end of the white pages - and called the animal control center . The woman who answered the phone promised to send someone right out , but when he gave her his address , she said , " Oh , that dog . " " You know it ? " " I heard it last night . I live just down the street from you . " She laughed . " Do n't worry ; I 'll find it a good home myself . " Then she lowered her voice and said , " You 're new to the neighborhood . " It was n't a question . " That 's right , " Shelby admitted . " Well , I 'm throwing a party next Saturday for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since you live in her house now , maybe you should come and meet us . " Shelby 's heart thudded hard against his chest . He swallowed , then said , " Is there any more of her unfinished business that I should know about ? " His neighbor laughed again . " With Marlene , you never know . But if there is , we 'll take care of it . " " Wonderful , " Shelby said . " I mean , thank you . That would be good . " He got her name and address , and promised to be there on Saturday . He was relieved to learn that they met at 7:00 , not midnight . After he hung up , he looked back at Lunch , who had managed to pull the cookie sack off and was looking at him with his head cocked to the side in the classically cute pose that little animals do so well . He looked so contrite that Shelby momentarily reconsidered keeping him , but only for a moment . Lunch might be cute , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might even be a supernatural guardian , but he was still a royal pain in the ass , and Shelby was not a dog person . <p>
