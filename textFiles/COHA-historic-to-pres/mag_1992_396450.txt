Wiley Carroll and I sat in his living room looking at album after album of old-time pictures of hounds and hunters . I had recognized Carroll 's place the moment I 'd turned the corner and seen the two sheepherders ' trailers that Carroll always used to use in lion camp . The trailers are now weathering in disuse . Age and ill health keep Carroll closer to home these days , but he remains the recorder , reporter , correspondent  --  the historian  --  of those who follow and have followed those remarkable animals called cougar hounds . " This was another famous lion hunter , " Carroll said , pointing to a photo that dated from the ' 30s , judging by the old truck parked beside the man and his hounds . I smiled at the words " another famous lion hunter . " When a man earns the title of mountain lion hunter , it 's almost always preceded by the word " famous . " That has become such a given fact that when Carroll compiled a book of letters from old-timers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two of the three men could be identified that all three had been famous lion hunters . Is it possible to be both forgotten and famous ? For lion hunters the answer is , probably , yes , because at one time , the man had no doubt been famous for what he did . I was about to ask Carroll why all cougar hunters are famous , but he had already launched into a story . " My hounds had this lion bayed on a ledge back under the overhang of a cliff at Spring Valley , " he started . " It was about 200 feet straight up and down . I was on top and just above them , but I could n't see what was happening behind that overhang . It was important that I get far enough over the brow to shoot that lion before it killed some dogs . " I started to ease myself toward the edge , but the slick , frozen ground sloped downward . Both feet scooted out from under me , and I went into a slide . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to be near a falling rifle that could fire if it hit a rock . Mostly , I had a bigger need for both hands . But they were n't stopping me . I slid nearly 20 feet and was about to go over when I was able to grab a tree hanging from the edge of the overhang . " That was close . If the fall had n't killed me , I 'd still be there , anyhow . Falling is the only way into that canyon , and there 's no way out . " I never even thought to ask Carroll if he got the lion . I was too preoccupied with a memory of my own . Billy Pat McKinney and I were riding along the rim of a high desert canyon in southwest Texas . That cliff , too , was about 200 feet straight up and down . McKinney was riding his iron-shod mule along the very edge of the rim on a narrow strip of bare rock  --  slick metal against slick rock  --  just so that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the drop-off . ( The needlelike ends of lechuguilla are indeed dangerous to animals if they break off under the hide . They do n't fester ; they work through the body like porcupine quills . ) McKinney was so at ease  --  whistling , singing , flapping his legs to motivate the mule  --  that I actually started to follow on the horse that I was riding . My mount took all of two steps behind McKinney 's when every little hair on my body stood straight up . I learned how to carefully weave a horse through lechuguilla real fast . The last time that McKinney and I hunted together , we were on foot in a dry stream bed while the hounds searched the high rocky areas around us for lion scent . I watched one hound angle up a huge rock wall so steep that I could n't have held onto it with both hands and feet . The hound trotted along on the slightest protrusions of rock like a goat , going higher and higher and then finally angling back down . That memory provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters and hounds are famous not only locally , but sometimes nationally ! Anybody crazy enough to go where lions go has to attract a certain amount of attention . And though mountain lions rarely attack humans , not all cougars believe in that rule . The hounds , of course , are in far greater danger than the hunters or handlers are from this animal that can kill with a single bite at the base of the skull or swat its victim off a high precipice . One time , Carroll 's hounds caught up with and bayed one lion at the back end of a 40-foot cave  --  a dangerous situation for all involved . The cougar had already killed one hound , and Carroll had no flashlight . Luckily , he was able to find and light a couple of pitch knots , and because the cave had an eight-foot ceiling , he could walk inside upright and prepare to shoot . Carroll could see the cat 's green eyes in the flickering light , but the remaining six dogs were in the way . As the hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a safe shot , the lion solved his problem . It leaped over the hounds and came straight at Carroll . The burning knots fell from his hand , and he fired in time to drop the lion at 10 feet . Was the cougar attacking , or simply trying to get out of the cave ? Only the lion knew for sure . There are two ways to hunt lions . The easy way is to drive around looking for a fresh track in the snow , then free the hounds for a relatively short race to the tree . Some hounds learn to speed things up by running the sight trail . But the hounds that fascinate me are those that can cold-trail a lion away from a sheep kill in the dry heat of a Western summer and stay with that trail until the lion is jumped . Once the lion is running , it 's usually a short race . Cougars are equipped for sprinting , not endurance . Wiley Carroll and his hounds spent 20 years in predator control for the state of Nevada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and sheep were only on our range in the spring , summer and fall . They 've moved far to the south when the snow flies . My hounds had to trail on dry ground and hot rocks , sometimes licking the rocks to freshen the scent , or perhaps to verify the presence of scent by tasting . " Like hounds of all dry-ground lion hunters , Carroll 's dogs were as likely to run the trail backward as forward . Part of the reason was where lions go . The scent particles dry up quickly . But lions are n't strongly scented , either . The same dogs would almost never backtrail a bear . Another famous lion hunter with the same problem was Arizona 's Swede Larson , who as a government hunter established the Arizona record of 56 lions in one year . But Larson got tired of always having to dismount and search for tracks to verify direction or turn the hounds around . " When I have to do half the barking and half the trailing , " he grumbled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somebody got some good hounds . Nearly all of the famous lion hunters , Carroll included , used ( and still use ) what they call " bred up " hounds . " I worked with the Lee Brothers Guide Service for a year , " Carroll said . " Clell bred and sold a bunch of Blueticks , but I did n't see those big old chuckle-headed hounds at the tree . The hounds Dale used  --  he did most of the hunting  --  had to have ability , and color did n't matter . " Carroll started with a Jack Butler dog crossed on a Smoke Emmett hound . Others were Giles Goswick hounds , and some traced to Gus Lanaghan . All of these men were famous lion hunters , and the hounds of such old-timers were a mix of coonhound colors , foxhounds that had adequate nose , and more often than not , one-eighth to three-eighths bloodhound . Chances are , some hunters thought the introduction of bloodhound genes would add much-needed nose . However , unless the early bloodhounds had more olfactory power than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a myth . On top of that , bloodhounds back then , as now , trailed too slowly and treed poorly . But the cross did have a worthwhile effect , according to Carroll . It produced a hound with a strong inclination to stay on the first track started instead of switching to a hotter scent perhaps left by an animal other than lion . We can understand the importance of a dependable trailing hound when we think of what it takes to train a lion dog . Professionals who urge arranging for a three-week hunt to be reasonably sure of getting a lion . Imagine trying to keep young hounds away from temptation during those three weeks between lions . Imagine trying to train pups that are n't inclined to stay with the faint scent of cougar when hotter trails are crossed . Mountain lions are sparsely scattered , but not scarce in the sense of being a threatened species . In fact , Carroll says Nevada now has three predator hunters protecting sheep because of the lion spillover from California , where cougar management has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except when mating , adult cougars do not tolerate their own kind well . When mamas throw babies out of the nest at 16 to 24 months of age , the youngsters move on  --  and not into another lion 's established home range  --  or else . This wide separation of individuals makes it difficult to train hounds because lions are n't encountered often enough . Some hunters have trained hounds on more frequently encountered bobcats before advancing to lions . A Southwestern hunter hired to do lion predation work in Mexico unexpectedly found himself in an area infested with bobcats . He was amazed at how much better his dogs became on lions after treeing a bunch of bobs . Most cougar hunters add an extra touch that stirs the predator instincts of their hounds . They feed lion meat as a reward after a successful chase . Wise hunters also feed it the day before a hunt to heighten incentive . Beyond that , the dry-ground lion hound needs superb conditioning . One old trainer said that a hound is tough enough for lion hunting when you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also tough enough to live on the very edge nearly every time out , he may earn the title of " another famous lion hunter . " Wiley Carroll was once that tough . And so were the old-timers he knew and knows . Challis " Speed " Matheny , an Irishman from Illinois , was knocked to the rails by a loose mine car that cut off his arm at the shoulder , but that did n't stop him from hunting . Carroll remembers watching Matheny try to get a clear shot at a lion that was fighting the hounds on the ground . Fearing for the dogs , and unable to shoot because they were always in the way , Speed recklessly grabbed his loaded lever-action by the barrel and waded in swinging . The big cat clamped its teeth on the gun 's stock , but the action spread the dogs , and Carroll was able to get a killing shot . I thought about Speed 's recklessness later on another trip to Texas as I watched Bill McKinney stand on a rock at the very edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Indians and lions . I could picture Wiley Carroll grabbing the tree as he almost went over the edge . Perhaps this high-wire recklessness is a part of becoming " another famous lion hunter "  --  and why this flatland writer may never quite become one .
