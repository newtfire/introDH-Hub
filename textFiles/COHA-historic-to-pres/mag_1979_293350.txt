When gloating Iranian students brandished a document purporting to show that two of their American hostages are spies for the CIA , one perplexing question arose : How could such a document be discovered ? Prudent security procedures decree that " sensitive " cables 1 ) should not contain the real names of clandestine operatives ; 2 ) should not be duplicated ; 3 ) should be among the first documents to be destroyed in the event of an attack on the embassy . <P> In Tehran , none of these procedures seems to have been carried out . Security may simply have become lax , one well-informed observer charges , and top-secret cables may have been widely distributed among the embassy staff . Says an intelligence expert : " The problem is that everyone squirrels away in his office some of the stuff they invariably have to have on a day-to-day basis . As long as a project is active , the tendency is to keep a copy for yourself . " <P> When the takeover of the embassy began , embassy employees may not have moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets were designed to withstand only a ten-minute attempt at forced entry or 20 minutes of lock picking . By the time the documents were released , the invaders had had three weeks to work on the locks . Says a former CIA man of the Tehran employees : " They got caught with their pants down . " <P> Such sloppiness has angered Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , who has ordered U.S. embassies to use more care in safeguarding their secret files . One measure that has been largely abandoned is the dependence on thermite grenades for quick incineration of secret documents . U.S. outposts are now instructed to rely on shredding machines . But no matter what technology is chosen , the vigilance of those handling it is the real key to protecting U.S. secrets . Observes an old embassy hand : " Vance 's new rules will last until people forget about them . "
