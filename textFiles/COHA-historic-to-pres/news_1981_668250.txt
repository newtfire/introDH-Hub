It was just the other day that I was invoking the 19th century shade of Myra Bradwell , but with the nomination of Sandra Day O ' Connor to the Supreme Court , the old story takes on an especially poignant meaning.From Mrs. Bradwell to Mrs. O ' Connor , it ' s been a long , uphill climb for ladies in the law . Myra Bradwell , may she rest in peace , was a native of Vermont who moved to Chicago sometime in the mid-1850s . Not long after ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 , she did a most audacious , unfeminine thing : Sheapplied for a license to practice law . Curiously , she did not rely upon the equal-protection clause but rather upon the privileges and immunities clause . In any event , the Supreme Court of Illinois summarily turned her down . No women were to be allowed in court . Mrs. Bradwell appealed . In April 1873 , the US Supreme Court also gave her the brush-off . It was within the police powers of Illinois to limit membership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Chase dissented , and he didn ' t say why . Justice Joseph P. Bradley was so shocked by the whole astonishing idea that he wrote a flaming concurring opinion in which two other justices joined . History , nature , the common law and " the usages of Westminster Hall from time immemorial " argued against the proposition . Bradley felt impelled to expand upon the wide difference in the spheres and destinies of man and woman . " Man is , or should be , woman ' s protector and defender . The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life . The constitution of the family organization , which is founded in the divine ordinance as well as in the nature of things , indicates the domestic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain and function of womanhood . . . . The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfill the noble and benign office of wife and mother . This is the law of the Creator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general constitution of things , and can not be based upon exceptional cases . " It would be interesting to know what ever became of Myra Bradwell . She was born a century before her time , but last week ' s nomination of Sandra O ' Connor to the high court vindicates her pioneering effort . The Senate Judiciary Committee expects to expedite confirmation hearings on the nominee , in an effort to complete action before the August recess . Mrs. O ' Connor will be welcome on the court . Members of our highest tribunal come to that bench equipped not only with experience in the law but with all the other experiences of their lifetimes also . It takes nothing from Thurgood Marshall ' s stature to observe that Lyndon Johnson wanted to name the first black to the court . By the same token , it is evident that Mrs. O ' Connor has been chosen over males with much higher qualifications precisely because she is a woman . Just as the court has benefited in times past from a Western viewpoint , or an academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the viewpoint of a lawyer in private practice , now we will have some benefit , however subtle , of a woman ' s viewpoint . Excellent ! In the term just ended , the court disposed of cases having to do with abortion , child custody , teen-aged sex , nude dancing , sex discrimination in employment , property settlements in divorce and the registration of women ( but not men ) for a potential draft . No one can say how Mrs. O ' Connor might have voted in these cases if she had been sitting on the court . She might have voted just as the departing Potter Stewart voted . But she would have brought to the consideration of these cases a body of personal experience - a cast of mind , if you please - that has not been there before . None of this , I know , is supposed to matter . Justices in theory approach each case without personal prejudice or bias . They function as carpenters , in one metaphor , who simply lay the boards of law against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justices are not disembodied spirits . They are mortals , and to this day they have all been mortal men . Now we are to have a mortal woman . Myra Bradwell would be pleased . And so am I.
