Across Utah 's Bonneville Salt Flats whipped the piercing whine of a J47 jet engine . Technicians huddled around their electric timers . " Here he comes ! " somebody shouted . A strange object that looked like a wingless jet airplane flashed into sight , roared past and disappeared , leaving waves of refracted light dancing in the brilliant desert dawn . Strapped in his cramped cockpit , Craig Breedlove , 26 , pressed a button that released two colored parachutes , and the Spirit of America skidded to a halt . " All I know , " he said , " is that I was moving fast . " The timers told how fast : in two runs through Bonneville 's measured mile , Breedlove had averaged 407.45 m.p.h. - faster than any man had ever traveled on wheels before . <P> At What Price ? Breaking the world land speed record has been Craig Breed-love 's obsession ever since he was a car-struck twelve-year-old in Los Angeles and talked his parents into letting him buy an aged and battered Ford - " not to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 , two years after London Fur Broker John Cobb set a new land speed record , gunning his twin-engined , 2,500-h.p . Railton Mobil Special up to 394.196 m.p.h . Over the years , dozens of daredevils have tried to crack Cobb 's mark , and few sporting pursuits have been so costly to participants in terms of money and life . The turbine-powered Bluebird of Britain 's Donald Campbell is , so far , a $5,000,000 flop . Three years ago , Utah 's Athol Graham was killed when his homemade car lost a wheel at better than 300 m.p.h . Last year California 's Glenn Leasher drove his jet-powered Infinity past the timers at more than 400 m.p.h. , but moments later an explosion scattered car and driver over a square mile of Bonneville salt . <P> Breedlove paid for his dream too . In stead of going to college , he took a variety of odd jobs ( welder , fireman , sports car salesman ) that allowed him free time to build fast cars and race them . His first wife divorced him . In 1959 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was through , he quit his job , exhausted his unemployment compensation , was scrimping by on the earnings of his second wife , a waitress in a drive-in ( and a car buff like himself ) . " Four years , " he said last week . " Four years of seven days a week , 18 hours a day-no movies , no going out to dinner , no TV , nothing but work . " <P> A well-to-do Mormon bishop bought Breedlove an airplane jet engine . Designers helped him with problems of aerodynamics . He drew up a brochure , built a tiny-scale model of his car , went in search of sponsors . Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. donated the special tires he needed , and Shell Oil Co. agreed to pick up the rest of the bill . " He 's a remarkable salesman , " said one Shell executive . Shell 's contribution came to about $150,000.
