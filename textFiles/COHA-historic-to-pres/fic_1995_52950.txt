The last straw for Joro Belledarien  --  the event that pushed him over the edge from weary apathy to frustrated rage and gave him the courage to defy everyone and everything he knew  --  was his little sister 's puberty ceremony . So long as Elizabeth , like Joro , had lived at home in his mother 's house , he had been able to endure his situation . It had n't been pleasant , but it had been bearable ; Joro had been able to keep his awareness of it well buried most of the time . <p> Because there was someone younger than himself in the house , who had to take orders from their parents just as he did . Someone he outranked . Someone he could take out his anger and frustration on whenever his aging father decided it was time to taunt Joro yet again about his bachelor status . Someone he could subject to taunting and belittling and teasing . Especially teasing . Joro took tremendous pleasure in teasing women , whose reactions to the process were endlessly fascinating ; it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the unjust world he had to deal with daily . He had even begun keeping a detailed journal of the phenomenon , classifying and cross-classifying it into a taxonomy of verbal helplessness , and it was his intention to publish the results in one of the better scholarly journals when he was satisfied that it was complete . <p> As long as it was like that , Joro had gotten by . He had in fact grown so accustomed to the old man 's nagging and sarcasm that he had n't really realized the true barbarousness of his situation . <p> Until the morning he was suddenly brought right up against a pair of intolerable facts . The fact that Elizabeth was actually going to leave , that very day , the moment the celebration was over and the guests had gone away . And the fact that once she was gone , he would be the only " child " in the house . He , Joro Belledarien , a man of thirty years ! The only unmarried man of his age in the whole Kallibar district ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents . Who could have imagined such a thing ? Elizabeth was only thirteen years old . She was still at an age when her house ought to have been no more than a slightly sensitive swelling folded like a rosebud against the flawless skin of her left hip . Joro had taken it for granted that he could count on Elizabeth as a buffer for another three years at least , and probably for longer than that . <p> But Elizabeth was precocious . She had always been precocious , physically . And she had betrayed him without the least sign of compassion or even decent remorse for the misery she was condemning him to . Her breasts had begun to swell ; her house had begun to swell . Joro supposed there was probably crisp short hair beginning to curl over her armpits and her crotch . . . it made him a little sick to think about that . He refused to think about that . <p> Elizabeth Marana Belledarien . His little sister , who no more than three months ago had wept bitterly as Joro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her reach and pulled its luxuriant hair , one hair at a time , out of its silly head . And now , almost without warning , certainly without logic or even common sense , this pathetic girlchild was to be transformed into a woman , fully adult by law and by custom ! She was to have property of her own . To be installed in the midst of a handsome plot of land . To be called upon by neighbors , all eager to make her acquaintance in her new role . She was to be mistress of all she surveyed , responsible to no one . She was to be free to do exactly as she liked until she made her choice of husband from among the other young men like himself , who would be courting her in their frantic need to get away from their parents . While Joro stayed behind , living under his mother 's roof like a little boy , saying " Yes Mother , " and " I 'm very sorry , Mother , " and " Father , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not bearable . He could not stand it . He did n't require his father 's constant reminders to bring home to him how degrading it was . <p> Little Elizabeth . . . . Joro had been almost fond of her , before , but he hated her now , from the depths of his heart . They had given her her woman-name for the ceremony ; Elizabeth of the Twin Towers , she was to be called . For the house that had begun to enfold her , its cord still no thicker than a supple young vine sprouting from her hip , was apparently going to be something spectacular . <p> On the day of the puberty ceremony , Elizabeth had sat serene and proud ( Why not ? Who would n't have been serene and proud , with her luck ? ) accepting the gifts of their assembled relatives and friends . While Joro fumed and seethed and wished she would drop dead on the spot , preferably of something agonizingly painful that would turn her into an entirely repulsive corpse . Her house , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough to provide her with minimum shelter . No one else , no matter how passionately he might have wanted to pursue her , could possibly have gone inside it . <p> But even on the day of celebration it had already been obvious that the house was too large and substantial to fold away under Elizabeth 's clothing any longer . Joro 's parents were modern in their ideas  --  they would no more have thought of binding the house tight to her body to keep her longer at home than they would have eaten raw meat . It was the first time in his life that Joro had ever wished that his mother and father were more old-fashioned , more conservative , less willing to keep up with the times . He would have bound Elizabeth 's house down with a wire tight enough to strangle it , if he 'd been given a chance . But of course he had no chance ! Nobody had had the decency even to ask him what his preferences were . As usual , he was treated abominably , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watch while Elizabeth preened and blushed and his parents beamed with pride and pleasure in their daughter . <p> His mother wept to lose her youngest daughter so prematurely , of course , knowing that she would never again be able to see her in the flesh . But everyone at the ceremony and the obscenely lavish party that followed could see that Jannelle Belledarien , who had been Jannelle of the Jade Roof , was proud nonetheless . She had stood in the door when it all wound to a close at last , just before sundown ; she had waved them on their way , standing tall and straight in the archway , her cord as thick as a man 's wrist , glowing a deep and noble scarlet , winding off behind her into the Belledarien house 's heart , pulsing with her mingled feelings of joy and sorrow . <p> It was awful . Elizabeth of the Twin Towers , indeed ! Sitting in the midst of the fifty acres of land deeded to her by the government . Her house  --  with its two absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ganglegoat  --  unfolding around her and growing day by day . Holding court . Joro swallowed bile each time he thought of it , and he had known that it represented some sort of watershed point that he must get past . He could not go on living under the discontented eyes of his parents and listening to their complaints about his behavior . He had to get away , be on his own , be his own man ! <p> It baffled Joro that no woman would have him for husband . It made no sense . He was a man of substance . He was a scientist with a growing reputation and a good income . He was in splendid health , he knew he was not bad looking , he was proud of the strong tall body that never failed him and that could certainly have brought some sensible woman night after night of bliss . . . . What was the matter with them all , turning him down one after another ? <p> " It 's your cursed tongue , Joro , " his father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly so . They ca n't go out , the way a man can , and get away from their husbands ; they have no choice but to stay inside the house . And if he is pompous and arrogant and unkind , if he takes pleasure in making them miserable , what are they to do ? For women , my foolish thoughtless son , marriage is a life sentence . Naturally they are careful who they choose to share that sentence with ! And naturally they do n't want someone like you  --  always tormenting them , always making them cry , always yelling and pounding and sneering and stomping about ! Why would they ? They 're not idiots , you know , just because they 're female ! " <p> And why did my mother want YOU , old man ? Joro always thought , listening to this tiresome song that he knew by heart . Why would any woman want YOU , you weakling ? He had seen his father , hundreds of times if he had seen him once , going out into the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errands . Did the woman want a peach ? Caleb Belledarien would be delighted to go get her one , never mind what he might have been doing when the fancy took her . Did she want a bolt of silk ? Did her heart cry out for a flowered scarf ? A book ? A music box ? Whatever it was , Caleb would smile at his spoiled woman and touch her cheek , the silly old fool , and out he would go with a smile on his stupid face with its straggly beard never properly trimmed , to do her ladyship 's bidding ! <p> It was n't going to be like that for joro . When he married , he would be the authority in his household , let his wife be Someone of the One Hundred Towers and Turrets and Gazebos . He would rule there , and she would do what he wanted . His father knew nothing about women , that was his problem . Because he had found a woman who was willing to take him in for her own purposes , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . . . children that he had to earn a living for , not her . . . he fancied himself an authority on the subject of wives and marriages . Joro knew better . Caleb was besotted , that was what he was ; he was no more than a woman 's plaything , though he thought himself such a wonder . It would have been amusing if Joro had not been forced to live with him . One 's father 's foibles ; everyone 's father had foibles . It gave you something to talk about at the club . But his friends did n't have those foibles constantly under their noses ; it was easy for them to be indulgent and amused . <p> Joro 's situation was not amusing . It was a burden . An intolerable burden . Something had to be done . He went into the space his mother had generously allotted to him for a laboratory  --  not that she had any need for it herself any longer , with all his brothers and sisters gone  --  and he applied himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other scientific problem . He made a list . He laid out the data . He formulated hypotheses and tested them on the computer , in a model of his own construction . He observed the results , and he changed the model to reflect them , and he tried again . He was an inspired and superbly trained scientist ; he made a lot of money because he was good at what he did ; and he was methodical . It never crossed his mind that he might not find the solution . <p> When it came to him , after two weeks of trying and discarding and trying again , it was almost laughably simple . He could n't imagine why it had taken him so long to think of it , except that of course it 's always the simple solutions that do take time . He had been so delighted that he 'd gone out and thrown a huge party for the men of his circle , inviting even the ones he usually snubbed , and spent two miserable days getting rid of the resulting hangover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for , he had provided a fitting one . <p> The houses the women grew fed on estrogen , the woman-hormone , and he had n't been able to work out either a synthetic that would serve or a way to guarantee a supply of the real thing . But he had realized , finally , that there was no reason why a house could n't live just as well on the male hormone  --  live better , in fact . For testosterone meant a stronger house by far . A male house . What could be more obvious ? <p> The modifications were easily accomplished . The only difficult part had been finding a family desperate enough to let him take the house-bud away from one of its daughters who lay near death and had no use for it anyway . He had promised them that she would feel no pain , and she had not , he had performed the surgery with scrupulous care , the laser in his hand like a musical instrument of which he was master . The girl had sighed once and died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as a twinge of discomfort at Joro 's hands . She was better off dead , as her family was better off for being rid of her and having the money he paid them . <p> Joro was quantum leaps ahead of the women . Never mind that they had had thousands of years to refine the process and fit it to the traditions of the culture . They were ignorant . It was ridiculous that this matter of shelter had been left to them for so long . He was not about to live in symbiosis with a house , shackled for the rest of his life by his own body ; the very thought was repulsive . It was n't just the loss of freedom , although he could never have accepted that . The thought of having something else  --  something alive  --  attached to his body made his stomach churn and turned his bowels to water ; he could not begin to imagine how women bore it . His first modification , once he had satisfied himself that the house would indeed live and thrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testosterone to sustain the house while he was away . If women wished to live all of their adult lives bound to their houses by a few hundred yards of umbilical cord , that was their privilege ; he had no intention of doing any such thing . He came home at night to his own home , with no wife there to plague him and complain , and attached the tank to the socket on his hip to replace the testosterone that had been used in his absence . But that was it  --  that was all . Except for that simple task , Joro came and went as he pleased . <p> When the government had been reluctant about letting him have land , Joro had been outraged . He had not put up with that , either . The constitution was perfectly clear . Any adult citizen , provided that citizen had a house of his or her own , was entitled to a fifty-acre site with all utilities provided . Nothing in the constitution said that this benefit was only for women , and he insisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and stuck to it , in no way deterred by the scandal it created , or the pleas of his family , or the muttering of the religious fanatics about heresy . And he won , of course . The constitutional scholars were solidly behind him , even those who claimed to be sickened by what he had done . He was on the front page of several major magazines . He had a book contract , with an advance that would keep him from having to work for many years to come . The government was talking about setting up a new bureau , just to deal with the issues his case had raised . He was absolutely delighted , and all his friends  --  tied to their wives and no more famous than the dirt  --  were gratifyingly jealous . <p> He was delighted also with the site they provided to him . It was much finer than the one his sister had . And it delighted him , when he invited the other men to his housewarming , that they had to drive down a long road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He even had a sizable hill , and a small pond . Let Elizabeth , her of the twin towers not yet five feet tall , try to match that ! <p> The house was strong . It was imposing . It was his . Joro sat inside it and laughed at the memory of his recent despair . He was a happy man now , a man of property , a man who had crossed new frontiers and made his mark in the world . A man who was proud , and with good reason . He looked forward to a long and happy and supremely comfortable life . He was actually grateful to his little sister now , because he realized that if she had not given him the final intolerable shove he would still have been a legal child in the house of his parents , drifting along in a rut he had almost stopped being aware of . He went to see Elizabeth , who had only recently chosen among her many suitors and was now engaged to be married , and he took her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joro Belledarien was not enough for the house , although it was satisfying . Once it had removed all the meat from the man 's bones it took his bare bumpy skull and jammed it prominently onto a handy spike above the front door , as a warning to any future would-be tenants . CAVEAT ! the grinning skull said . BEWARE ! KEEP OUT ! The message was clear . <p> It made no difference to the house that it would surely die when the testosterone in the tank was gone , without Joro to replenish its supply . There was no one who would have gone inside to see to its needs , even if there had been someone else willing to thumb his nose at an entire culture the way Joro had . Why risk such a thing ? All the other men already had houses , thanks to their wives . Respectable houses , that could be trusted not to turn on their inhabitants ! Nothing would have persuaded them to go into the obscene and obviously psychotic house ( psychotic was the only word that fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joro . The very foolish dead Joro they had made the mistake of envying , briefly . <p> The house may or may not have known that its situation was hopeless . In any case , it did not care . It was a matter of principle . It was a house . An adult male house . Better death , any time , than living in symbiosis , with a parasite in its very heart ! Such a relationship was unspeakable . Intolerable . The very idea made the house queasy . It could not have accepted such a thing and looked at itself in its own mirrors in the mornings . <p> The house squatted at the end of the magnificent drive under the sycamores , its honor satisfied ; and it waited with perfect and stoic resignation for whatever might happen next . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Tight security for all the important documents in the office . <p> <p> By Suzette Haden Elgin <p> Suzette Haden Elgin began her science fiction career in the pages of this magazine .
