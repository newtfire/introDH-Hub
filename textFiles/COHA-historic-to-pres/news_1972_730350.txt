The Food and Drug Administration halted today the introduction into cattle feed of a growthstimulating hormone that has been linked to cancer , and banned its use entirely after Jan. 1 . The hormone , diethylstilbestrol , or DES , has been given in small quantities , usually a gram or so over an animal 's lifetime , to about three-quarters of the nation 's cattle to help fatten them for slaughter . In the mid-nineteen-sixties , the hormone was suspected of causing vaginal cancer in the daughters of women who had taken a drug containing DES during their pregnancies decades before . Increase Estimated Higher beef prices are likely to result from today 's action.1 A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture estimated that when the total ban goes into effect beef will cost 3.5 Gents more a pound . Today 's announcement by Dr. Charles C. Edwards , the Commissioner of Food and Drugs , allowed the continued use until the end of the year of those feeds that still contained the hormone . Three Democratic Senators ? William Proxmire of Wisconsin , Edward M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained in statements that the ban should have been total and immediate . Senator Proxmire noted that 21 nations had completely banned the use of the hormone in animal feeds . Danger Is Seen Mr. Proxmire released the text of a letter from Dr. Frank J. Rauscher , head of the National Cancer Institute , that said in part : " Although a direct connection between the ingestion of DES in beef and the development of human cancers can not be documented , the presence of the chemical in food does in my view constitute a danger that should be circumvented . " The Department of AgriculIture and the F.D.A. have been , criticized for years by consumer 's groups for what they characterized as foot dragging on the DES issue . However , Dr. Earl L. Butz , Secretary of Agriculture , said he regretted the F.D.A. ac- , tion although he realized that under the law the agency had ) had no choice . The move stemmed from the so-called Delaney amendment to the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act , which specifically prohibits the use in food products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans or animals . DES has been shown to cause , cancer in laboratory animals. , However , the supporters of the continued use of DES maintained that the residual- amount of hormone left in meat sold publicly was either nonexistent or trivial . Dr. Edwards said that last Friday " new scientific data developed by the United States Department of Agriculture and received by my office casts serious doubt on our ability to set rules for the use of DES in animal feed that will insure against residues remaining in animal livers at the time of slaughter . " The amounts that have been found were in the range of a few parts of DES per billion parts of meat . Economists at the Agriculture Department have estimated that American consumers would pay $300-million to $460-million additional annually if the use of DES and all other growth stimulators were pro-hibited , Food scientists have estimated that an animal given DES will reach a market weight of 1,000 pounds 35 days sooner and will use 500 pounds less feed than a comparable animal without it . The extra feed required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the eventual cost of producing the beef cattle . Today 's ban did not extend to the implanting of DES in cattle , which the F.D.A. and the Department of Agriculture now have under study . In the implant method , a capsule containing a small amount , of DES is inserted in to the animal 's ear and it is gradually released into the animal 's system . The animal receives a smaller amount of hormone than by the feed method . In discussing DES in feed and in implantable capsules , Dr. Edwards emphasized that the ban was " not based on any known hazard to human health . " However , using more sophisticated sampling techniques , Government scientists have been able to detect four times as much DES residue in animal livers this year as a year ago . " No human halm has been demonstrated in over 17 years of use , " Dr. Edwards said . " Under the law , however , this continued use of the drug may no longer be permitted .
