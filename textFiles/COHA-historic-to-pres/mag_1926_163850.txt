THE CABINET <P> The negotiations between the Greek debt-funding mission and the U. S. commission last week came to a halt while the Greeks cabled Athens for instructions . Their opening gambit had been declined and they wanted to know what move to make next . They offered to fund the Greek debt ( a principal of $15,500,000 ) if the U. S. would lend them $32,500,000 additional- the remainder of a credit which was originally extended . The U. S. commission politely but firmly represented the impossibility of loaning Greece any more money even to get the original debt funded . Hence the delay while Athens was asked what the next Greek move would be . A few days later it was announced that M. Cofinas , head of the Greek mission , would have to go home to consult with his government , but that " negotiations will be continued for the present through the Greek minister .
