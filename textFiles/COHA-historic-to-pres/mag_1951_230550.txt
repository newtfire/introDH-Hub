When Cellist Pablo Casals staged a Bach festival in the French Pyrenees town of Prades last year , he did not so much come out of retirement as invite others to join him in it . Last week , playing in the airy courtyard of Perpignan 's 13th Century Palace of the Kings of Majorca , Casals was really out in the open . He made a 30-mile move from Prades to more accessible Perpignan ; fellow musicians and some 2,000 music lovers made global pilgrimages to hear him . <P> Last year 's festival honored Bach ; this year 's get-together was frankly in honor of Casals himself . The composer whose work dominated the program : Mozart . ( " After Bach , " says Casals , " it is Mozart I like most . " ) <P> The maestro 's Mozart , which he directed from a pillow-padded armchair , was sometimes hampered by lack of rehearsal and by lack of a disciplined first-rate orchestra , but at its best it showed the same deep understanding and respect for the composer 's intentions as does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special problems . Perpignan 's tramontane , a strong , cold wind that sweeps along the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean , kept the orchestra grabbing for their music , finally made them clip the sheets to the racks with clothespins . The wind also played havoc with the acoustics , made the most desirable spots those on a chairless balcony above the platform . Astute music lovers sacrificed comfort , sat on the balcony floor , their feet dangling over the edge . At the second night 's concert , the tramontane brought an unseasonable downpour that soaked the motionless audience to the skin before the concert was called off . <P> Most of those who flocked to Perpignan thought little of the discomfort . Said Soprano Jennie Tourel , who gave stirring performances of Mozart and Bach arias : " Casals literally radiates music . He just makes you sing . " Said Pianist Rudolf Serkin , whose Beethoven and Bach sonatas with Casals were festival high points : " Without looking at him you feel all his intentions . We understand each other like an old happily married couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strenuous three weeks in the open . " Last year , at the first festival , I suffered from stage fright because I had n't played in public for so long . Now I enjoy it all immensely . " At one point in mid-festival , a bit tired from the heavy load of rehearsals and performances , the 74-year-old maestro felt faint for a moment , had to pause briefly before going on . But this week , apparently none the worse for wear , he was getting ready for three weeks of recordings , talking about another festival next year .
