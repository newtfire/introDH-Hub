There is more than a touch of schizophrenia in America 's midyear mood . The nation remains well disposed toward Jimmy Carter , yet lacks confidence in his ability to handle the uncertain economy . Americans complain that the Government is not doing enough to whip inflation , yet want the Government to quit meddling so much in their lives . They want Carter to do something , yet doubt that any one individual-even a President-can solve the nation 's problems . <P> According to a survey conducted for TIME by Yankelovich , Skelly &; White , 58% of the people regard Carter as a leader who can be trusted , down only 4 percentage points since March ( see following story ) . At the same time Americans are increasingly uneasy about inflation , and only 25% of those surveyed expressed confidence in Carter 's ability to handle the economy , a plunge of 8 points since March . That general skepticism appears to be reflected in the skittish behavior of the stock market , a pretty fair indicator of business confidence . The Dow Jones average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week then burping back slightly to 912.23 ; at the end of 1976 , the Dow stood at 1,004.65 . <P> The public 's apprehensions are not shared by economists interviewed by TIME correspondents across the country . Most agree with the Administration that inflation , now at an annual rate of 10% , will be slowed in the second half of the year-unless wage settlements in labor negotiations get out of hand . Last week the Labor Department released two figures that strongly buttressed the Administration view . Wholesale prices rose in May by only .4% , the smallest rise in nine months and less than half the 1.1% rise in April . At the same time , the unemployment rate dropped to 6.9% in May from April 's 7% , the lowest level since November 1974 and a heartening decline from January 's 7.3% figure . <P> Winter 's Cold . " The worst is over , " says United California Bank Economist Raymond Jallow in Los Angeles . Jallow and other economists believe that the price spurt in the past months was due mainly to the economic effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. , the New York consulting firm headed by Alan Greenspan , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists and formerly Gerald Ford 's chief economic adviser , notes that " the chances of a significant acceleration in inflation rates as the economy moves into 1978 appear to be diminishing . " <P> One reason : the shift by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns to a tighter monetary policy . Burns fears that an overly rapid expansion of the money supply might fuel inflation ( TIME , June 6 ) . His view was disputed last week by Budget Director Bert Lance , who complained that the Fed 's stinginess has prompted major banks to raise lending rates for their best customers to 6.75% , up from 6.25% . Lance believes that the increases could worsen inflation and weaken the recovery by pricing loans out of many businessmen 's reach .
