Ma Bell 's slip shows in a San Antonio courtroom <P> On Oct. 17 , 1974 , T.O . Gravitt , the 51-year-old chief executive in Texas for Southwestern Bell , of which he was a vice president walked into the garage of his $120,000 north Dallas home , turned on the ignition of his Oldsmobile and settled back to die of carbon monoxide poisoning . Later that day , Gravitt 's family and Bell colleagues found in his briefcase a nine-page memo accusing his company of political payoffs , illegal wiretapping and using questionable bookkeeping to secure telephone rate increases . A hand-scribbled message added , " There is bound to be much more . Watergate is a gnat compared to the Bell system . " <P> An emotional overstatement , certainly-but Gravitt 's suicide touched off a scandal that three years later is badly damaging Ma Bell 's image as the staid gray lady of American corporations . In a San Antonio courtroom last week , past and present Southwestern Bell executives accused each other of everything from bribing Texas newspapers and politicians to playing host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell system companies . They were testifying in a $29 million libel and slander suit brought against Southwestern Bell by Gravitt 's widow , Oleta Gravitt Dixon , * and James Ashley , who was fired as general commercial manager for the San Antonio office of Southwestern Bell a few days after Gravitt 's death . The widow claims that the company hounded her husband to suicide ; Ashley maintains that he was fired because he and Gravitt were about to expose the " incorrect , duplicitous , deceitful " methods that Bell had used to get rate increases in Texas . <P> Until last year , Texas was the only state where such increases had to be approved by city officials , and they were frequent and large enough to make it traditionally one of the most profitable states in the entire Bell system . Ashley claims that Southwestern Bell officials were constantly wooing and bribing politicians in such cities as Austin and Dennison . <P> Among other things , he says , the executives entertained politicians on hunting expeditions at Bell resorts in rural Texas gave them credit cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staged a three-day orgy at the TraveLodge in downtown San Antonio , where some Bell women employees became party girls Ashley also accused the company of giving top executives a $1,000 raise on the understanding that it was to be donated in $50 installments to a political slush fund . The pot was used for contributions to local and state officials friendly to Bell rate increases . Ward K. Wilkinson , the company 's Austin lobbyist , admitted that he collected $1,200 a month from Bell executives for a political fund that was kept in cash in his office safe .
