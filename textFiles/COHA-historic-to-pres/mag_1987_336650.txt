The rumors mounted by the hour as Wall Street lunged and lurched through its wildest week . Many of the country 's biggest brokerage firms and investment houses were said to be in trouble , even sinking : E.F . Hutton ; Merrill Lynch ; First Boston ; Goldman , Sachs . Speculation swirled so briskly around Hutton that President Robert Rittereiser had to assure employees that the firm 's financial resources were " strong and fully adequate . " Though similar reassurances echoed up and down Wall Street , they left many doubts . As the stock-trading chaos continued , what would happen to the $50 billion American securities industry ? <P> One Wall Street response was to turn to Madison Avenue . Sober television commercials popped up between World Series innings to reassure investors that their money was safe , and full-page ads appeared in major newspapers . Declared Prudential-Bache in large black type : " Now , especially now , you need an investment firm that is rock solid . " That , of course , is exactly what Prudential claimed to be . Shearson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we share the concerns of every serious investor . " Admonished Merrill Lynch : " The worst thing to do right now would be to sell at distressed prices . " <P> While the brokerages tried to talk up investor confidence , the extent of the damage they had sustained was not known . The financial impact of Black Monday was delayed by a New York Stock Exchange rule that allows five working days to pass before traded securities must be paid for . But the 15 biggest U.S. firms clearly had taken huge losses  --  by one estimate , anywhere from $50 million to $250 million each  --  as they were caught with immense inventories of stocks that they could not sell . For those behemoths , with more than $20 billion in total capital , the bloodletting was serious but not fatal . For at least half a dozen small brokerages , however , the selling pressure was too much to withstand . Some agreed to be swallowed by larger firms to avoid bankruptcy court . Predicted Edward Altman , professor of finance at New York University : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is all over . " <P> Even before Black Monday struck , there were signs that Wall Street 's five- year stay in Fat City was ending . Profits were shrinking : during the second quarter of 1987 , U.S. brokerages generated $553 million in pretax income , in contrast to $2 billion in the first three months of the year . Retrenchment of some kind was already in the cards . Last week 's crash guaranteed that it will be harsher than was previously expected . <P> There is plenty of shrinking to do , since during the long bull market U.S. securities firms simply grew and grew . Employment in the nationwide industry rose from 273,900 in 1982 to 450,600 last August . Wall Street jobs , which account for one out of every three U.S. securities positions , grew 57% in that time , to 157,000.
