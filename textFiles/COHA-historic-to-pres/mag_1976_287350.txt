Alexander Calder 's timing was never off . On the face of it , the best death an artist could have is to perish laden with age and honors yet still working , and at a time when he is thrust anew into the public eye through a large and deservedly popular exhibition of 50 years of his work . Such was the context of Calder 's death last week , from a heart attack , at the age of 78 . The flag on New York 's Whitney Museum , where his show of more than 200 works had opened in October ( TIME , Oct. 25 ) , went to half-staff in deference to the man who had possibly been the greatest , and certainly the best loved , of his generation of American sculptors-the man who taught sculpture to move . <P> Calder 's activity straddled two continents ; he kept studios in France and the U.S. , and was one of the first American-born artists to be accepted as a charter member by the European avantgarde . Still , as his good friend Fernand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent American . " His heritage was also art . His Scottish-born grandfather , Alexander Milne Calder , came to the U.S. at 22 , later sculpted the famous 37-ft. statue of William Penn that stands atop Philadelphia 's city hall . Father Alexander Stirling Calder sculpted the classic George Washington statue at the arch in Manhattan 's Washington Square . However , the third Alexander Calder demonstrated from his childhood an adventuresomeness and ingenuity that clearly marked him as no mere follower , even of his talented forebears . <P> Growing up in Arizona , California and New York , young " Sandy " Calder tirelessly crafted playthings and other gadgets out of wire , wood and nails . In 1919 he graduated as an engineer from the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken , N.J. , then set out on an eccentric progression of technical jobs . As a boilerman on a passenger liner , he devised a contraption to direct sea breezes into the stifling engine room . In the mid-1920s , while Barnum &; Bailey Circus to the National Police Gazette . Moving to Paris ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a compliment to be called crazy . " ) , he began the miniature circus of wire sculptures that he kept adding to for decades . <P> Warm , Witty . In 1933 Calder and his wife Louisa ( a grandniece of William and Henry James ) bought an old farmhouse in Roxbury , Conn. , which became home for the artist 's astonishing fecundity . His Roxbury studio resembled a tinker 's shop more than some rive gauche atelier ; wire and pliers and corrugated cartons filled with the flotsam of a lifetime lay about in splendid I-know-just-where-it-is disarray . There , and in the house near Tours , France , that he acquired in 1953 , the sculptor would lumber about , creating a stage set for Martha Graham , fashioning coffee cups for his kitchen , filling a commission for the Brussels World 's Fair or New York 's International Airport .
