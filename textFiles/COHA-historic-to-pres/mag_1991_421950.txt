Section : INVESTING My assignment : track down the elusive Warren Buffett , the world 's greatest investor , and learn his trade secrets <p> Like so many stories , this one began when a writer suggested a good idea , only to have editors mess it up . The writer ( me ) , a newcomer to MONEY , proposed a story that would tell readers ( you ) what they could learn from the best professional investors . One of the gurus I mentioned was Warren Buffett , a man widely regarded as the world 's greatest investor . Buffett , however , is noted for two idiosyncrasies : he manages money from an office in Omaha , far from the canyons of Wall Street , and he does n't generally talk to reporters . <p> The conversation with my editors went like this : <p> Editor : We loved your idea , but why do n't you focus on Buffett ? Call him up , meet with him , find out his secrets . Readers will love it . <p> Me : Oh boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a point . Starting out 40 years ago as a disciple of Benjamin Graham , the father of modern securities analysis , Buffett built an estimated $4.1 billion fortune by never losing sight of Graham 's principles for spotting undervalued companies . A $10,000 investment with Buffett in 1956 , when he first started managing other people 's money , would be worth more than $15 million today . And so I set off in pursuit of the world 's greatest investor . THE ROAD TO OMAHA <p> Warren Buffett , I now know , is regarded by colleagues and friends as one of the nicest rich guys . He shuns most luxuries and still lives in the same modest frame house that he bought 35 years ago . <p> Salt of the earth , you might say . Well , that 's not what I was saying after I tried to set up an interview with him . Consider my first telephone call to Buffett . Or rather , to his trusted assistant of 23 years , Gladys Kaiser . <p> Me : Good morning . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a story on how to invest like the world 's greatest investor , Warren Buffett . Could I speak to Mr. Buffett ? <p> Mrs. Kaiser : No . <p> Our conversation continued as I patiently explained that I wanted to fly to Omaha to interview Buffett at his convenience , and Mrs. Kaiser just as patiently explained that her boss did n't like to give interviews . I had a problem . How could I write about the world s greatest investor if the world 's greatest investor would n't talk to me ? I asked my editors . <p> Me : Buffett does n't like to give interviews . He wo n't come to the phone . What should I do ? <p> Editors : Fly out to Omaha anyway , and see if he 'll come to the door . <p> Me : Oh , boy . <p> In no time at all , I was packing my bags for a flight to Omaha . Before leaving , however , I looked through a slew of books and magazine articles that have chronicled Buffett 's career . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Buffett  --  from his favorite restaurant to his favorite stocks . I also got copies of the past 14 years of annual reports for Berkshire Hathaway , a former textile manufacturer that Buffett uses as a holding company for his investments . <p> Buffett owns 42% of Berkshire , which has the highest stock price of any publicly held company in the U.S.  --  $8,500 a share . When the press says that Buffett has invested in a company , the actual buyer is usually Berkshire Hathaway . Among the company 's major subsidiaries : National Indemnity , a property/casualty insurance company ; Mutual Savings &; Loan Association ; See 's Candies , California 's leading candy retailer ; Borsheim 's , a jewelry , store ; Nebraska Furniture Mart ; and the Buffalo News . In addition , Berkshire has large stakes-worth some $5.4 billion , or more than half of its total assets  --  in six publicly traded companies : Capital Cities/ABC ; Coca-Cola ; Federal Home Loan Mortgage , which packages , guarantees and resells residential mortgages ; Geico , the automobile insurance company ; tine Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . <p> Buffett 's letters to shareholders in Berkshire 's annual reports have a cult following among investment professionals and amateurs alike . In them , Buffett aw-shucks his way through subjects from the financial position of Berkshire Hathaway to the virtues of giving to charity . He writes about people who work for him as though they were family and quotes everybody from Karl Marx to Al Capone . <p> But Buffett is n't the Norman Rockwell character he seems : For one thing , Buffett 's wife and the mother of his three children , a 59-year-old former cabaret singer , resides in San Francisco , while the 60-year-old Berkshire chairman lives in Omaha with his fortysomething girlfriend , a former restaurant hostess . For another , although Buffett preaches the value of heartland living , he owns a vacation home in arty Laguna Beach , Calif . <p> Clearly this was a man I needed to talk with face to face . So I packed my suitcases and headed to the airport . OMAHA , DAY 1 <p> I boarded America West Flight 606 , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grandfather who drinks Cherry Cokes and chews See 's fudge refuse to meet me after I had flown 1,250 miles ? I got my answer in the lobby of Kiewit Plaza , a modest office building in downtown Omaha where Berkshire Hathaway has its headquarters , when I called Mrs. Kaiser from me security guard 's desk . <p> Me : Hello Mrs. Kaiser . I hope you remember me , Gary Belsky from MONEY magazine ? I called a few days ago and told you I was doing a story about Mr. Buffett , the world 's greatest investor ? Well , I wanted to meet him so badly that I flew here without an appointment . How about it ? Can talk with him for a few minutes ? <p> Mrs. Kaiser : No . <p> She did n't seem surprised that I had traveled halfway across the country to talk to her boss , even after he had declined to meet me . I found out why when I handed the phone back to the guard . <p> Guard : You took that better than most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a lot ? <p> Guard : A bout once a day . <p> Me : Does she ever let them up ? <p> Guard : Sometimes . <p> Me : Do you think she 'll let me up ? <p> Guard : No . <p> And there I was : almost two full days until my flight home with nothing to do in Omaha but visit Boys Town and the Strategic Air Command Museum . I was tired and I was frustrated . But most of all , I was hungry . Half hoping to corner Buffett over a lunch of T-bone steak and home-fried potatoes ( his favorite meal ) , I headed to Gorat 's Steak House ( his favorite restaurant ) on Center and 49th Streets . Buffett was n't there . So I continued reading about him as I ate my fish sandwich and french fries . <p> The son of an Omaha stockbroker who became a U.S. congressman , Buffett had bought his first stock by age 11 . But it was n't until he attended Columbia University Business School in the early 1950s that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock-picking method known as value investing . With his colleague David Dodd , Graham wrote a seminal textbook called Graham and Dodd 's Security Analysis , which is still required reading in most business schools . <p> Graham first published his book in 1934 , when the 1929 crash was still fresh in every investor 's mind . As a result , he put tremendous emphasis on a company 's financial strength and recommended buying shares that were so cheap , relative to the net worth of a company 's assets , that they were unlikely to get much cheaper . <p> After graduating , Buffett wrangled a job at the great professor 's investment firm , Graham-Newman in New York City . While Buffett 's investing strategy evolved over the years to pay more attention to a company 's growth prospects , he remained close to Graham in spirit . Buffett 's two rules for investing : 1 ) Never lose money ; 2 ) Never forget rule No. 1 . ( For 15 mutual funds and stocks that combine low risk and large potential gains , see the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant , I learned that Buffett might be at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium that evening : the hometown Creighton University Blue Jays were playing Wichita State in the College Baseball World Series . So I went to the stadium , arriving at about 7 p.m. , and elbowed through a crowd of 18,000 screaming Creighton fans to look for a five-foot-11-inch man with salt-and-pepper hair and glasses ( okay , it was a long shot ) . No luck . OMAHA , DAY 2 <p> The next morning I embarked on a new course . If I could n't talk to Buffett himself , I would talk to people who knew him . My first stop was the Nebraska Furniture Mart , which Buffett bought in 1983 from the Blumkin family for $55 million . Rose Blumkin , 97 , started the store in 1937 with $500 and built a spectacularly successful business by selling furniture and carpeting at big discounts . Buffett was so impressed by Blumkin  --  and by her children and grandchildren who worked for the store  --  that he signed his check without taking inventory . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to any business . And his confidence in the Blumkins has certainly been justified : last year Nebraska Furniture Mart had sales of $160 million  --  more than any other single furniture store in the U.S. <p> Unfortunately , though , my visit with Ron Blumkin , president of Nebraska Furniture Mart , was n't very . helpful . <p> Me : I 'm doing a story about Mr. Buffett , and I 'm trying to find out a little bit about his investments . I thought it might be help. /hi to talk to people who work-lot him . Could I ask you a few questions about Buffett 's investment philosophy , ? <p> Ron : No . <p> Ron explained that he never discussed investments with Buffett . I then went across the street , where I got my first break : an interview with Ron 's grandmother . Two years ago , Rose Blumkin had a spat with Ron over the way she was running the carpet department at Nebraska Furniture Mart . So she did what any nonagenarian would do : she opened her own store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad that Buffett did n't take her side , zips around Mrs. B 's Warehouse , as her new store is called , on a motorizect cart . <p> Me : Mrs. B , you 've known Warren Buffett for years . You sold him your first furniture store . Your children and grand-children still work for him . You 've watched him make billions of dollars from his investments . I need your help . How does Warren Buffett do it ? <p> Mrs. B : Luck . <p> Not much insight there . So I turned to Kirkpatrick Pettis Smith Polian , Omaha 's leading independent brokerage and the descendant of a firm owned by Howard Buffett , Warren 's dad . There I hit pay dirt  --  or so I thought  --  in the form of George Morgan . A broker , Morgan proudly proclaims himself a " Buffett wannabe " and has written a book about his hero . <p> Me : Mr. Morgan , I 've been in Omaha for two days trying to find Warren Buffett and figure him out . You know him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You even have a picture of him on your desk . Can you tell me the secret of his success ? <p> George : Marathons . <p> Me : Marathons ? <p> George : Yes . Buffett understands that investing is kind of like running a marathon . It takes a long time . Do you know what I mean ? <p> Me : No . <p> I left a few minutes later , with a copy of Morgan 's book under my arm . If I was ever going to figure out Warren Buffett , I was going to do it in New York City . I had a plane to catch . HOME <p> Back in New York I knew my editors would ask what I 'd come up with , so I devised a plan  --  I avoided them . <p> I also placed two dozen phone calls to officials at the companies in which Berkshire Hathaway has invested . Much to my surprise , many of these people called back : Warren Buffett did n't have time for me , but the heads of some of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairwoman Katharine Graham ( " I do n't know a damned thing about investing , but I do know that Warren is really sort of a genius " ) ; from Coca-Cola president Don Keough ( " Warren sees the happy side of the coin " ) ; and from Cap Cities/ABC chairman Tom Murphy ( " Warren does n't confuse himself . He has a great ability to look at things just the way they are " ) . <p> It appeared I would have to tell my editors that I had struck out , that I could n't interview Buffett , and that talking to his friends and business associates was n't very helpful . But before doing so , I decided to review what I had learned from my reading . I was able to deduce five pieces of advice for investors who would emulate Buffett 's style : <p> Look for companies with strong balance sheets . Though securities analysts differ about the signs of financial health . virtually all of them agree that excessive debt is a bad sign . Berkshire Hathaway 's major holdings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than hall ' their equity . <p> Buy when a stock is undervalued . When Buffett began buying his Washington Post stake in 1973 , the intrinsic value of the business was estimated to be at least $400 million  --  yet all of the company 's stock could have been purchased on the open market for $100 million . Buffett acted on this discrepancy : he paid $9.7 million for 1.7 million shares , which are now worth more than $381 million . While it can be hard for individual investors to spot undervalued stocks , one sound approach is to limit your purchases to stocks with price/earnings ratios at or below the overall market ( currently 17 times estimated 1991 earnings ) . <p> Invest in companies with bright prospects for long-term earnings growth . Buffett looks for companies that he calls wonderful businesses . They are characterized by superb management , a well-established product line or service , and protection from low-priced competition . The classic example : Coca-Cola . Starting three years ago , Buffett bought 23.3 million shares at an average price of $44  --  or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth $52.6 billion . <p> Concentrate on a small number of stocks . Contrary to the nearly universal investment maxim that investors should diversify among a dozen or more stocks , Buffett is willing to limit himself to six or eight issues . As long as you check out stocks carefully and buy at reasonable prices , you can get adequate diversification with a handful of stocks and not have weak performers dilute the returns from your big winners . One caution : you have to be prepared to hold your stocks for 10 years or more . so that there is plenty of time to make up for any short-term setbacks . Buffett has kept two of the six big holdings in Berkshire 's portfolio  --  Washington Post Co. and Geico  --  for 15 years . <p> Include high-yield investments in your portfolio . As takeovers and leveraged buy-outs proliferated during the 1980s , Buffett found a way to turn a low-risk profit on all the dealmaking . He offered to serve as a management-friendly shareholder . investing in companies such as Salomon Bros. , Gillette . Champion International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that they created special preferred shares for him that paid 8% to 9% a year and could be converted into common stock . Many companies , of course , do n't have such convertible issues outstanding and they wo n't create them to order for small investors Nonetheless , you can learn a valuable lesson from Buffett 's strategy here : when you are shooting for a big gain , bet on stocks with high yields . That way , you 'll be paid while you 're waiting for big profits . <p> Armed with my conclusions about Buffett 's investing approach , I walked down the hall and faced my editors . <p> Me : So that 's it . No interview with the world 's greatest investor , no mystical secret to his success , no startling revelations , I 'm sorry . I guess I should pack tip m V stuff , huh ? <p> Editors : Yeah and right away . We want you to do a story on a guy in Cleveland who earns six figures and pays no income taxes  --  legally Call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Readers will love it . <p> Me : Oh , boy . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Unwilling to settle for an unreasonable facsimile , writer Belsky went in search of the real Buffett . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Where 's the Buffett : I missed Warren at his favorite steakhouse . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : I struck out trying to find my man at the local baseball stadium . <p> BY GARY BELSKY <p>
