In Stanley Spiro 's case , the man , the hour , the music and the geography have met . Here you have this Long Island , N.Y. , dentist who retires with his wife Thelma to Florida and becomes , in his words , " light-headed , lackadaisical . " So he puts together a band , a big band  --  Stan Spiro and the Townsmen Orchestra , featuring music in the Glenn Miller mood  --  and all of a sudden retirement is a dream , just one long Moonlight Serenade . <P> " The first two sets , we spoon-feed them , " Stan was explaining the other night at a place called O'Shea 's , a vast waterfront establishment that seats 500 when they are n't dancing to Stan . " We mute the trumpets and the trombones , and we blow easy . After that , we let them have it . " And so he did , with Sing , Sing , Sing , Sing . <P> Stan and Thelma are from Brooklyn , N.Y . They met at a restaurant where Stan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thelma recalled . " You know how it is , " Stan interjected . " You have to talk up the tip . " Well , whatever he did , he got her number , and it was n't Pennsylvania 6-5000 . <P> Marriage , and training in tooth repair and extraction at Temple University , soon followed , with Stan sitting in with this band or that to earn some money while he learned his trade . Stan plays alto sax , clarinet and flute . For a few weeks in 1939 , he actually played with the Glenn Miller . And before his education was done , he had also played with Jack Teagarden and Maynard Ferguson . Then for 38 years he was a dentist and anesthesiologist in Hempstead , on Long Island . He produced two books , Amnesia-Analgesia , Techniques in Dentistry , and Pain and Anxiety Control in Dentistry , neither of which is as much fun as , say , Stomping at the Savoy . <P> A couple of years ago , when Stan turned 65 and retired , he and Thelma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Marco Island , a clean , windswept three-mile by five-mile sandbar in the Gulf of Mexico . The surroundings were gorgeous ( Marco Island , with the soft brush of its palm fronds sounding like rain in the night , is the sort of place even bona fide Floridians retire to ) , but full-tilt retirement did n't agree with Stan . He was n't In the Mood . <P> Not to say Stan and Thelma did n't give retirement a shot . For a while there , they practiced what Stan called senile maneuvers . In a little rubber dinghy that moved , Stan said , " like a burnt-assed bunny , " they conquered islands . " We take a new island , it falls , and Thelma goes in , in steel helmet and full pack " is the way Stan described it . The act wore thin , apparently , for in that fashion Stan and Thelma Do n't Get Around Much Anymore .
