Strategists Differ <P> Herbert Hoover is the only living ex-President of the U. S. Alfred Landon is the latest Republican President-reject . As such they are the titular leaders of their party . Unfortunately for their party , however , they have taken such bad political beatings that their prestige is badly battered . And to make matters worse , they last week made manifest how much they are at odds . <P> Month ago at the Sinnissippi farm of onetime ( 1917-21 ) Governor Frank Orren Lowden , near Oregon , Ill. , the two Republican chieftains met and announced that they were " in agreement on every essential problem . " This meant that they were not prepared to disagree in public . However , last fortnight in Topeka , Alf Landon called a national radio mass-meeting , spoke his mind on the state of the Union for half an hour ( TIME , Nov. 1 ) , without so much as a lukewarm mention for Herbert Hoover 's biggest political plan . Last week , addressing a meeting of 3,000 Republicans in Boston and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans with his Plan . <P> This Hoover plan is to hold a Republican convention to draw up a platform- just as is done in Presidential elections- before next year 's Congressional elections . Some Republican Congressmen , and presumably Alf Landon , fear that votes may be lost locally by a platform assaulting the New Deal . Herbert Hoover brushed this aside . <P> Doing a far better oratorical job than Landon had done the week before , he drew applause from his audience by promising that he wanted no public office for himself in 1940 . Attacking the New Deal with the sarcasm that began to appear in his public utterances after he left the White House , he spoke of " balanced abundance " that " seems to recall the trapeze . " Of the Liberalism of the New Deal he remarked : " Its folds can apparently even be entered through the Ku Klux Klan . . . . When you deal with other people 's money , the word is conservative , not liberal , especially with a capital L. " <P> The shortcomings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " moral integrity . . . personal liberty . . . financial and economic policies . . . aid for the less fortunate . . . relations to other nations . " He saved for his peroration his retort to those , including Alf Landon , who lack enthusiasm for his proposed " intellectual session " of the G. O. P. : <P> " If the Republican Party has not learned the lesson that it must produce principles and program besides being against and joyriding on mistakes , it has not read history . . . . There is talk of fusion and coalition . Let me make but one remark on that . It is a result devoutly to be wished for . But the people fuse or coalesce around ideas and ideals , not around political bargains or stratagems . If the Republican Party meets the needs and aspirations of the people who are opposed to the New Deal , they will fuse and coalesce and not before . They only join in the march if they know where we are going . ... " <P> At Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Hooverian and Landonian plans of campaign . Last week a United Press poll of committee members showed 32 in favor of the Hoover plan , 18 noncommittal , one opposed .
