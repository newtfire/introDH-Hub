Hoffman , Charles Fenno , 1806-1884 : AFTERTHOUGHT . from Afterthought ( 1847 ) 1 What though I sigh to think that after all 2 ' T was half some erring fancy of the mind , 3 Half that illusion which they ' love ' miscall 4 Whose sense dreams not of sentiment refined : 5 They to whom ne'er that gush of soul was given 6 Which melts the heart to mould it but for Heaven  --  7 What though to think it was but this perchance 8 Prompts the half-wistful  --  half-disdainful sigh ; 9 Makes the fond tone  --  the tear  --  the tender glance 10 Seem less than valueless in memory : 11 Still would I rather my love ran to waste 12 Than she I love ' love 's bitterness ' should taste .
