WON AT LAST On February 8 , 1877 , from his New York home , 13 West 30th Street , Lester Wallack wrote : " My dear MacKaye , If you can come to my house tomorrow ( Friday ) morning at eleven o'clock , I will hear the first three acts of your comedy and sincerely hope something may be done about it . " This comedy was my father 's play , Won at Last , which  --  though still unfinished  --  Wallack thereupon accepted , and produced at his theatre , the following season , with H. J. Montague , founder and first " Shepherd " of the Lambs Club , as its " leading juvenile . " " My dear MacKaye , " wrote Montague , April 19 , 1877 , from Washington , D.C. : " Will you , like a good fellow , seriously think of finishing my piece ? I want it very badly . " In response to this urgent reminder , my father completed the play hurriedly at Stamford , where the whole last act was written in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has recorded , " he never stirred from his chair till it was finished . " During the following summer , at Dublin , N.H. , he revised the play , and gave a final reading of it to Wallack in New York on November 9th , which led at once to some " weeks of elaborate preparation " for the play 's production . On December 5th , my mother wrote to him : " Ca n't you get Wallack to forget that he ever had a play called How He Loved Her , and call ours How He Won Her ? I like that best of all . " On the same date , Montague wrote to my father : " Wallack tells me you want to call the piece John Fleming 's Wife . For heaven 's sake , do n't ! Even Tangled is better than that . A Life and a Love is much better . " So , up to the last minute , the play 's title was unsettled till , on December 10 , 1877 , it was first performed , at Wallack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1kb JOHN FLEMING MR . H. J.

Blaisdell The New York Dramatic News wrote of the play : " It is unquestionably the best of all the American comedies thus far produced , and the author has risen at one bound to front rank . It is the most original play produced in New York for many years . It not only delighted a large audience , but it gave a practical definition to Mr. Boucicault , who sat in a stage box , of what constitutes a comedy . " William Winter wrote : " The Wallack audience is usually cool ; last night it was full of flame . Won at Last is a thorough and really brilliant success . There are reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best judgment of the time . " " The production of a new play by an American author , " wrote The Stage , " is an event of such rare occurrence that it provokes a vast degree of curiosity . " Laid in an American setting , " on the coast of New England , " as in his earlier play , Marriage ( 1872 ) , Won at Last was welcomed for its indigenous characters and scenes . Montague contracted to pay $15,000 for the English rights . During several years , after its first run at Wallack 's , it was widely acted throughout the United States , including three revivals . The first of these was a spring road tour , in which Miss Blanche Meda and Miss Ida Gray ( both pupils of MacKaye in his School of Expression ) acted Grace Fleming and Jane McCarthy , C. W. Couldock acting Professor Tracy . The tour opened at Worcester , Mass. , April 22 , 1878 .

Its second revival , under the title of Aftermath , in which MacKaye himself acted John Fleming , took place April 23 , 1879 , at the first opening of the Madison Square Theatre , " MacKaye 's tiny Thtre Franais , " closing there May 20th . " Developed in less than a month , " wrote the New York Mail ( May 17th ) , " the Madison Square Theatre is today regarded as one of the leading houses .

MacKay , Professor Tracy , ran one week at the Chestnut Street Theatre , Philadelphia , opening there March 28 , 1881 ; two weeks of one-night stands in Pennsylvania , Delaware , New Jersey and Connecticut ; two weeks at the Bijou Theatre , New York , April 18-May 8 ; then Rochester , Buffalo , Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On an eastern road tour of MacKaye , September 26 , 1881  --  January 9 , 1882 ( opening New York , January 9 ) , Won at Last was performed alternately with his play , A Fool 's Errand .

I know you , John , well , and I know that you 're the last man in the world to marry any woman that you did n't adore . John . John Fleming Quite the contrary ; I 'm the last man in the world to marry any woman that I did adore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress ; it 's quite out of place for a wife . Dr. S. Dr. Sterling Stuff ! Not another word like that  --  you insult yourself . Why , John , you 'd be a kind of swindler if you married a noble girl like Grace without loving her . John . John Fleming Loving her ! Laughs Why , doctor , do n't you remember what Coleridge said about the ghosts ? Dr. S. Dr. Sterling Shortly No , I do n't . John . John Fleming Someone asked him if he believed in ghosts . Coleridge answered , " No , I 've seen too many of them ! " Dr. S. Dr. Sterling Well , what of it ? John . John Fleming Why , you see , I 'm like Coleridge ; you talk of love , but I do n't believe in it : I 've seen too much of it ! Dr. S. Dr. Sterling What do you mean ? John . John Fleming Simply that I have sounded every note of love , high and low  --  and found them all false , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Can you be in earnest ? Do you really mean to say that you do n't love your wife ? John . John Fleming Love her ? Laughing Why , not the least in the world ! Dr. S. Dr. Sterling Impetuously Wretched man ! Why did you marry her , then ? John . John Fleming Because my father 's dying words , recorded in his will , besought me to marry without delay , and in America  --  a mere notion of his , but sacred under the circumstances . Dr. S. Dr. Sterling No , not sacred ! The dead should bury the dead , not marry the living ! John . John Fleming There , now , do n't get excited . It 's not worth while ! Dr. S. Dr. Sterling But why did n't you marry a woman of your own soulless set ? John . John Fleming Because I saw none whose character I could trust . Miss Loring was well-bred , cultivated , and good ; she will make at least a tolerable companion , and save me the ridicule and disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sterling Oh ! This cold , cruel shopkeeper 's calculation is revolting ! John . John Fleming You need n't get angry , doctor , you were the one who made the match . Dr. S. Dr. Sterling Heaven forgive me ! I ought to have my fool 's brains knocked out for it ! John . John Fleming Why , what on earth 's the matter ? Dr. S. Dr. Sterling The matter ? Why , I 've been the means of entrapping Grace Loring into a degrading marriage ; yes , degrading , for the man who marries a woman without loving her degrades her . John . John Fleming Ah ! Thank you , doctor  --  Dr. S. Dr. Sterling Turning and staring at him John Fleming , have you no heart ? John . John Fleming I do n't know  --  perhaps  --  but if I have , it is a heart of ashes .

Tottering over to the porch Go ! Leave me ! This is my home , a pure and spotless home  --  and here I shall remain ! John . John Fleming Advancing toward her Grace , you amaze me !

Will Tracy A mistake , my dear sir . The great works of Herold on the evolution of a caterpillar , and of Seibold on the parthogenesis of insects , prove that moths have engaged the attention of master minds . John .

You can amuse yourself with a  --  a  --  the Pediculus humanus capitis ? John . John Fleming Rising and bowing Really  --  your kindness is overwhelming . Well , this is pleasant . The tribulations of matrimony have begun early . What am I to do if Grace refuses to go with me ? A nice position I shall be in  --  the butt of my club , the laughingstock of society . When she comes , what am I to say ? Bah ! I may as well take the bull by the horns : make this young woman understand that I appreciate the rights of a husband and mean to enforce them . I think I know how to be firm where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Grace . Grace Fleming Advancing slowly Mr. Fleming , I am here as you desire , though I can not comprehend why you should seek this interview ! John . John Fleming I am glad you have come , but I hope , my dear child  --  Grace . Grace Fleming Pardon me , sir , but I am no longer a child . Yesterday I was a happy , trusting , docile girl , but today I am a miserable , rebellious , heartbroken woman . John . John Fleming Aside And a wonderfully handsome woman , too ! Strange I never realized her beauty before ! Grace . Grace Fleming I am waiting , sir , to learn what it is that you can possibly ask of me now . John . John Fleming My dear madam , the attitude you assume takes me completely by surprise . I can not understand  --  Grace . Grace Fleming I do not expect you to understand . Your world and mine are too far apart . That which is sacred to me is silly to you ; that which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , then ! Go your way , and let me go mine . I will not burthen you with my existence ; I beseech you not to fetter me with yours . John . John Fleming Are you without mercy , madam ? Consider my situation a moment . After what you overheard last night , it would be useless and undignified in me to attempt to defend myself . Unfortunately , it seems we are man and wife . I have obligations to you which I have no right or desire to neglect . You also have obligations to me which  --  Grace . Grace Fleming I free you , sir , of all obligations to me . I claim the right of equal freedom from obligation to you . John . John Fleming Ah , madam , these matters are not so easily decided . You forget society . Grace . Grace Fleming I have no interest in society . John . John Fleming But society , alas , has a profound interest in you . Grace . Grace Fleming Then I defy society . John . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam ! Society is cruel  --  remorseless to those who defy her ! She never forgives . She covers her victims with the slime of slanderous tongues , pursues them with scornful eyes and bitter taunts into the remotest corners of the earth . Grace . Grace Fleming And what would you have me do , sir ? John . John Fleming Accept a situation you can not change , and go with me . Grace . Grace Fleming To be your wife ? John . John Fleming At least in appearance , as you are already in name . Grace . Grace Fleming Impossible ! John . John Fleming And why ? Grace . Grace Fleming Because I revolt at the idea of converting my whole life into a living lie . John . John Fleming With firmness Madam , I hope persuasion will not fail to move you ; for then  --  Grace . Grace Fleming Turning proudly Well , sir , what then ? John . John Fleming Facing her , with great determination For then , madam , I should be obliged to employ force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace crosses slowly to him Grace . Grace Fleming Do you mean , sir , that if I refuse to go with you , you will employ violence to force me ? John . John Fleming Do not mistake me , madam . I desire in all ways to deal with you like a gentleman . I ask nothing unreasonable of you . In the eyes of the world you are my wife . I ask only that you will meet the appearance of that position  --  Grace . Grace Fleming And if I refuse ? John . John Fleming Then , madam , the gentleman will disappear and John Fleming will become a brute ! Grace . Grace Fleming Which means ? John . John Fleming That I shall assert the rights of a husband without fear or favor . Grace . Grace Fleming After a pause , rising John Fleming , I am nothing but a poor , ignorant , helpless girl . I do not know what power society accords a husband over his wife , but this I do know ; I am not your chattel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so ! I am the mistress of my own life ; and rather than accept the abasement of an enslaved existence I would fling that life to the winds , death should divorce me from my degrading bonds ! John . John Fleming Stares with admiration , then turns ; aside By Heaven , she means every word she says ! This is a woman worth winning ! She 's a perfect revelation ! Grace . Grace Fleming I think , sir , we understand each other now . Permit me to retire . She starts up R.C. John . John Fleming One moment more , I pray you . Puts chair beside her , and she sits After the declaration you have just made , but one hope remains . I must appeal to your generosity  --  surely that can not fail me ! Grace . Grace Fleming And how can I be generous to you ? John . John Fleming By magnanimously considering the ridiculous position in which I find myself . If society is nothing to you , remember it is everything to me . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never cease to brighten your existence . But I have only this outward world of shams to live for ; little as I respect it , still it serves to amuse me . When that is gone , all is gone . Life is bare enough at best , but when barren of human society , it is simply intolerable ! Grace . Grace Fleming But how do I deprive you of society ? John . John Fleming By making me an object of ridicule . I chose you , madam , for your character , instead of your wealth . Society is already indignant at this . When it finds that the wife I chose has quietly flung me away , its indignation will change to scorn . On every side I shall meet the maddening smile of amused contempt , the lifted brow of supercilious pity . As one of the comedians of the world I am willing society should laugh with me , but not at me . No ! That is a price I would not pay , even for life itself . I should shun society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiresome emptiness of solitude . Be merciful , then , madam . I have a constitutional horror of a hermit 's life ; do not condemn me to it . Grace . Grace Fleming And how can I save you from it ? John . John Fleming Grant me the privilege of providing you with a home ; of bestowing upon you every luxury , every enjoyment , every benefit that money can secure . Think what a power for good my wealth may become in hands like yours . Grace rises Ah , madam , do not repel me . Say you consent to this . Grace remains silent Believe me , for I promise upon my honor , in the home I offer you , you shall wield all the power of a wife , and enjoy all the freedom of an unmarried woman . I know that you will respect the honor of my name , and I shall equally respect every wish of your heart . Another silence Think how much misery you will save us both , and since I can not be your husband except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least your friend . Grace . Grace Fleming Looking at him earnestly a moment , then extending her hand frankly Yes , I will trust you . I will go and be your friend . John . John Fleming Taking her hand Madam , you have made me your eternal debtor . She moves up to L. table ; he crosses , R. When can I come to claim you ? Grace . Grace Fleming Thinking a moment Return in an hour , I shall be ready then . John . John Fleming I shall be prompt . Permit me to say , au revoir ! John kisses her hand , goes to door , turns and looks back at her By Heaven , if I had a heart , that woman would command it for ever ! Exit Grace .

Such a woman is incapable of wrong . If there were the least danger of her falling in love with Mr. Tracy , she herself would be the first to banish him from the house . Dr. S.

Grace Fleming Certainly ! I 'm sewing . John . John Fleming Sewing , yes , I see , but then  --  why should you sew ? Grace . Grace Fleming Because it 's a pleasure . John . John Fleming Sewing a pleasure ? I never heard of such a thing ; and what are you sewing ? Grace . Grace Fleming Pointing to baby-clothes in basket I 'm making those . John .
