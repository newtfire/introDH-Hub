Home rule for the District of Columbia is falling between two congressional stools  --  a willing Senate and a balky House . The two wings of Congress have both passed home-rule legislation of sorts . But the House refuses now to send conferees to sit down with senators and bridge the differences . The Senate long ago approved the President 's home-rule bill to set up a mayor , city council , and even a nonvoting congressman . A much weaker charter-board proposal finally squeaked through a reluctant District Committee in the House . Its version could produce a home rule of sorts  --  eventually . But now the committee chairman , John L. McMillan ( D ) of South Carolina , refuses to appoint House conferees to meet with senators . Pessimists say the differences between the two bills are so wide they are unbridgeable . Mr. McMillan has n't entirely ruled out a Senate-House conference . But his well-known dislike of the home-rule idea does n't brighten the home-rule prospects any . Nor have recent militant " Free D.C. " boycott demonstrations helped persuade him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but its keeper objects . Wags in the Air Force call the MOL ? the Manned Orbiting Laboratory project ? " the mole " because it is so deeply burrowed in secrecy . It is the American project to explore the potential military uses of space . It is known to be nine months behind schedule and may slip still further behind . At first it was to orbit in 1969 , Now experts talk about 1970 . Air Force Secretary Harold Brown has convinced the House Armed Services Committee that MOL needs more money . He estimates the project should have $230 million to $290 million next fiscal year to stay on schedule . Only $150 million now is budgeted , so Congress has asked for $80 million more . Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara , in effect , is saying , " Do n't feed the animal . " He pooh-poohs any fund shortage and insists that often in the past other Defense Department projects have been funded faster than technical progress justified . But congressmen , worried about a Soviet counterpart of MOL now in the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " the mole . " Trends .. . The President 's Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) has found a new expert to ask about such policy matters as , " Should taxes be raised now ? " Their new " adviser " is an econometric model . The Office of Business Economics in the Department of Commerce owns it and has been running experiments . Each quarter the model is cranked up on a computer to produce forecasts of the state of the economy a year ahead . Since last fall these- forecasts have been fed quietly to the CEA . The model seems to have a knack for such things . In simulation runs it predicted the level of the gross national product from the post-Korean war years through 1965 . And it was off only an average $2.7 billion  --  a near-bull's-eye . The period embraced three recessions . One trend Washington ca n't see too much of is the private hand reaching out to help in Latin America . More and more American private citizens are pitching in on the Alliance for Progress . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business is pushing . It donated almost $1 million in surplus American tools and machinery abroad last year . Now it will concentrate on sending tools to needy regions in the hemisphere . In consort with the Pan American Development Foundation , it hopes to put $2 million worth of tools in Latin-American hands this year . Washington wonders if inadvertently it abets college cheating . Across the nation students are cramming for finals . And suddenly the government confronts them with draft-deferment tests . Nobody really knows how much cheating goes on in college . But research is beginning to peg the amount disturbingly high . Columbia University recently ran a study , polling 600 university deans and 500 student-body presidents nationwide . The deans estimated that 15 percent of the students cheated . Student presidents said it was closer to 20 percent . And students themselves estimated 25 percent . Experts insist that pressure ? parental , institutional , and self-imposed ? is perhaps the prime cause of cheating . Now there 's another , Washington-sent , pressure piled on : Students must get good grades to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
