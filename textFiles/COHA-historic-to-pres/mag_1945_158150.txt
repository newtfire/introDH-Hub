The Fourteenth Air Force had lost most of its bases in eastern China ( TIME , Dec. 11 ) , but it refused to be downed . <P> From secret northern bases , bomb-carrying Mustangs flew out to pound and strafe Jap airfields at Tsinan , in Shantung Province , 800 miles northeast of Chungking . In two assaults , 67 Jap fighters and bombers were smashed . The outfit which gave the enemy this stinging surprise was the " Yellow Scorpions " squadron , named for the gaudy spinners on the planes ' noses . The squadron had first distinguished itself in Burma ; when it was transferred to China , the Japs had hailed the move as an opportunity for revenge . Now the enemy had more revenge to get . <P> Neither foxy Major General Claire Chennault nor the foe gave any hint where the Scorpions had their nest . But it was so remote that written communications with Chungking would take two weeks by devious routes through enemy lines . When not engaged in banging at enemy airfields or escorting Superfortresses returning from Manchuria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotives on the Japs ' tenuous north China railways . In two months their score was 300 . <P> Far to the southeast , Chennault had dispersed his planes widely after the loss of Kweilin and Liuchow . Now , from secret bases , they went on attacking Hong Kong . The Japs retaliated by bombing two Allied airfields deep in Kiangsi Province .
