The long , wavering line-41 horses , with their boys in colored silks-broke suddenly and swept forward toward the first jump . They were over safely , hard to see against a patch of mist that touched the corner of the course . At Valentine 's Brook , Sir Lindsay , John Hay Whitney 's horse , was over first , with Shaun Goilin ( pronounced Shahn Goy-lin ) , right after him . At the open ditch , Gate Book went down and Gregalach , one of the favorites since Easter Hero was scratched , screwed sideways in the air , landed clear but had to be pulled up . He was down before the end of the first round . They had gotten around once and Shaun Goilin was in front coming to Becher 's Brook . He rose ' wearily , barely clearing , and Melleray 's Belle edged past , Sir Lindsay moved nearer . They took the last fence , Shaun Goilin still behind , Sir Lindsay starting for the wire , pulling up even with Melleray 's Belle . <P> To a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dark fungus around the crooked oval that is the Aintree course , the moments between the last jump and the finish must have been trying . Mr. Midwood is a Liverpool cotton broker who never bets on horse races , who once paid $53,000 for Silvio to win the Grand National , but failed , and admits that he does not know the pedigree of Shaun Goilin , whom he calls " a thoroughly Irish horse . " As he watched Sir Lindsay and Melleray 's Belle moving away , Mr. Midwood may have questioned the merits of his horse 's ancestry more seriously than ever before , and even the judgment of his jockey , the famed Tommy Cullinan of County Limerick , son of a sporting farmer , famed for his clever finishes and for leading with Billy Barton at the last fence in 1928 . But Tommy Cullinan was moving up the straightaway with Shaun Goilin , and in the final sprint he passed Sir Lindsay , raced Melleray 's Belle neck and neck in the last 100 yards , crossed the line a winner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Lindsay third ; far behind were Glangesia , Ballyhanwood . No others finished . <P> Shaun Goilin is an eccentric horse . He will not eat hay , oats , or bran when away from home , accepts only delicacies offered by a friend 's hand . All he had to eat on the day of the race was an apple his trainer gave him on the way to the post . <P> Most popular colors worn by the women in the crowd-mustard yellow , China blue , jade green . <P> Among those present-The Dukes &; Duchesses of Westminster and Marlborough , the Marquis Merry del Val , Lord Beatty . Lord &; Lady Birkenhead , Mr. &; Mrs. Winston Churchill .
