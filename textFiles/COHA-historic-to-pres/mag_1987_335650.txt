Would he talk or would n't he ? After a week of haggling over whether Marine Lieut . Colonel Oliver North would ever detail his multiple roles in the Iran- contra scandal , the zealous former National Security Council aide agreed to begin his long-awaited public testimony next week before the congressional committees probing the affair . But even as the committees worked with North 's lawyer to clear the path for the Marine 's testimony , other witnesses were planting land mines in his way . Their accounts raised a pointed question : Can North be believed ? <P> The colonel 's credibility was badly damaged when Security Consultant Glenn Robinette told how North had falsified backdated letters to make it appear that he intended to pay for a security system that Robinette had installed at his home in the spring of 1986 . In fact , the $16,000 system had already been * paid for by retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord , North 's partner in selling arms to the Iranians and supplying them to the Nicaraguan contras . As a Government employee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his job . <P> In early December of last year , shortly after he was fired from his NSC post , North called Robinette to ask why he had never received a bill for the security system . Robinette , a former technical specialist for the CIA , realized what the Marine colonel wanted . He sent North two invoices , one dated in July when the work on the system had been completed ; the other was dated in September , as though it were a second notice . <P> Back to Robinette in a single envelope came two responses from North , dated as though they had been replies to the earlier invoices and outlining optional methods of payment . The first letter was formal , the second informal , as though the two men had become friends in the interval . North even apologized in the latter note for the poor printing of the letter E , explaining , " Please forgive the type  --  I literally dropped the ( ( typewriter ) ) ball . " Actually , a document expert told the committee , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance from the letter dated earlier . <P> A series of more consequential deceptions by North was related by Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper . As the scandal was unfolding last fall , Cooper had been directed by Attorney General Edwin Meese to help pin down any official U.S. involvement in missile sales made to Iran by Israel in 1985 . The stickiest sale was a November 1985 shipment of 18 Hawk antiaircraft missiles in which an airplane chartered by the CIA carried the weapons from Israel . Not until the next January did Ronald Reagan sign a " finding " authorizing such covert action . <P> The CIA had initially supplied the White House with a fairly accurate account of the Hawk shipment . But when the late CIA director William Casey and then National Security Adviser John Poindexter were preparing to brief Congress last November on the Iran arms sales , North offered a drastically different version . At a meeting Cooper attended in Poindexter 's White House office on Nov. 20 , North forcefully claimed that no one in the U.S. Government had been aware that Israel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew of this flight , he said , thought the plane carried oil-drilling equipment .
