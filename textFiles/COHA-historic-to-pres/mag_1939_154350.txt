Last week at pastoral Oconomowoc , 33 miles west of Milwaukee , 42 of the fastest skaters in the U. S. whizzed around Fowler Lake . The first day 50 Oconomowocians watched them . The second day only 25 showed up . The rest of the week , even though it was free and only a stone 's throw from the centre of town , the spectacle attracted fewer and fewer onlookers . <P> But the fastest skaters in the U. S. were not disgruntled over lack of gallery as long as a handful of ear-muffed gentlemen , seated in a little wooden coop , remained on the scene . For they were officials of the American Olympic Committee and they were selecting a team of eight to represent the U. S. in the Winter Olympic Games at St. Moritz next February . <P> Like U. S. figure skaters , U. S. speed skaters do not show up well in European competition . At the 1936 Olympics , Norway made a clean sweep of the four speed-skating events . American skaters attribute this to lack of experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In U. S. , skaters race in a pack ; the first man over the line wins . In Europe , there is no jockeying for position , no jamming at the turns . Skaters race individually ; the man who covers the distance in the fastest time wins . <P> So eager is the Amateur Skating Union to make an impressive showing in international competition that they sent a half-dozen U. S. topnotchers abroad last winter to pick up experience . At the European-style Olympic tryouts last week the investment paid its first dividends . Although the No. 1 speed-skating event of the year had left the Oconomowocians cold , the American Olympic Committee announced that next year 's team will be the best ever sent to the Olympics . During the week three new records were etched into U. S. skating history .
