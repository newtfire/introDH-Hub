THIS work will scarcely be accounted a valuable contribution to our political history . The species of interest which was sought to be created for it is not likely to succeed with the American public ; and least of all does it hold out a prospect of resuscitation to the extinguished fame of Aaron Burr , or bid fair to reinvest his name and character with the interest which , for the space of a full generation , they have lost with the public Even the political value which might have attached to such a work seemed merged , on its announcement , in the greater attraction of anticipated details of forgotten liaisons ; and in the narrative itself , the solemn moral of Burr 's fate , and the instructive spectacle of his career , have been completely lost sight of , in the vain hope of reanimating the political hatreds of a disappointed man , and glossing over events long since adjudicated by the irreversible decision of public opinion . In the pursuit of this weak attempt , the author of these volumes seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possessin* the abstract interest which a simple narrative of Burr 's career could hardly fail to excite . There are , besides , many passages which show that the licentious secrets of a man notorious for his immorality , have exerted too strong an influence on the imagination of his biographer ; and the knowing airs with which an alleged amatory correspondence , and numberless intrigues , are referred to , that they may be ostentatiously withheld , from an affected tenderness to the reputations they would destroy , is alike repulsive to correct morals and correct taste . We select the following passage from the preface , before proceeding with our task  --  and others might be found in the work-for signal reprobation , as embodying in the most offensive manner these unpleasing peculiarities . " I entertain a hope that I shall escape the charge of egotism . I have endeavoured to avoid that ground of offence , whatever may have been my literary sins in other respects . It is proper for me , however , in this place , and for a single purpose , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . It is a matter of perfect notoriety , that among the papers left in my possession by the late Colonel Burr , there was a mass of letters and copies of letters written or received by him , from time to time , during a long life , indicating no very strict morality in some of his female correspondents . These letters contained matter that would have wounded the feelings of families more extensively than could be imagined . Their publication would have had a most injurious tendency , and created heartburnings that nothing but time could have cured . *Memoirs of Aaron Burr , with Miscellaneous Selections from his Correspondence , by Mathew L.

It is with unaffected reluctance that this statement of facts is made ; and it woul never have been made but for circumstances which have tr* nspired since the decease f Colonel Burr . A mere allusion to these circumstances will , it is trusted , furnish ample justification . No sooner had the newspapers announced the fact that the Memoirs of Colonel Burr were to be written by me , than I received letters from various quarters of the country , inquiring into the nature of the revelations that the hook would make , and deprecating the introduction of individual cases . These letters came to hand both anonymously and under known signatures , expressing intense solicitude for suppression . Under such circumstances , am I not only warranted in these r *marks , but imperiously called upon to make them I What other mode remained to set the public mind at ease ' ?

In order to leave no chance for distrust , I will add , that I never took , or permitted to be taken , a single copy of any of these letters ; and , of course , it is quite impossible that any publication hereafter , if any should be made of such papers or letters , can have even the pretence of authenticity . In the most corrupt stages of the most corrupt literature , we could not point to a more disgraceful passage .

The " no very strict morality " in these female correspondents-so numerous as to affect even " families more extensively than could be imagined "  --  the " injurious tendency " of their letters  --  and the " heart-burnings " they would create , even still ,  --  the danger that they might have seen the light , so darkly shaddewed forth in the precautions which rendered such a contingency only " next to impossible "  --  the deprecatory letters , " anonymously and under known signatures " - pouring " from various quarters of the country , " upon hint who had the fate of so many in his power ,  - -  expressing such " intense solicitude " for the " suppression " of these revolting details-would all seem to indicate an extent and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this libel , intact by suspicion , and where ten thousand swords would have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened with such insult . ' But we may calm our irritation and our fears . The " imperious** // nature of the case has impressed this gentleman also , and demanded of him a sacrifice , to " set the public mind at ease "  --  and it has been made -- made in such a manner as to " preclude all possibility of cavil on one part or anxiety on the other . " These parties , ( being the men and matrons of America , ) can never be sufficiently grateful . Every vestige of this infamous correspondence has been destroyed so effectually , as to leave the barest possible chance , for the cupidity of an unprincipled publisher , to improve upon the shadowed hint of a surreptitious edition ' We are not reading the confessions of some superannuated Faublas , magnifying to its purchasers , with the sagacity of interested candor , the importance of some suppressed narrative of their enormities-but the memoirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This language has not been used of the debauched society , of the worst periods of the worst courts of Europe , and we question if it could  --  but of American ladies in our own day ! Comment we scorn to make . La Harpe , speaking of La Puccile , says , " jamais l'impudence du vice et du b1asph*me n'avait 6t6 port6e it ce point . " We adopt the expression , and pass from the disgusting theme . Col. Burr 's family was highly respectable . His father , who has a place of his own in our biographical records , as one of the most eminent divines ofhis day , was the first president of Princeton College ; his mother was the daughter of its second  --  the celebrated president Edwards . He was born on the 6th of February , 1756 , and his parents died soon after , leaving him and a sister , afterwards married to Judge Tappan Reeve , of Connecticut . Few incidents of his college life are preserved by his biographer . We are told that he was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but that " during the last year , that he remained in college , he passed a life of idleness , negligence , and in some measure , of dissipation . " Some specimens of his juvenile compositions are given , ianorespect remarkable . At college , young Burr formed intimacies , some of which ripeaed into friendship , which , it is honorable to record , lasted throughout life . Some of the youthful correspondence between him , Mathias Ogden , Judge Patterson of the Supreme Court , and others , are among the most pleasing parts of the volume . In 1774 , the letters of Burr and his correspondents give us many interesting glimpses of the premonitory struggles of the revolutionary war , and in July , 1775 , after the battle of Buaker 's Hill , he joined the army , then lyiag at Cambridge . In the fall of 1775 , when Arnold undertook to lead an army of patriots through the wilderness , for the purpose of capturing Quebec-the most extraordinary expedition of modern warfare-young Burr resolved to accompany him , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the army . We have , even still , but an // imperfect idea of this wondrous march . Never was daring resolve carried through all the stages from chimerical absurdity to the nicest chance of conflict , with more devoted courage , energy and enthusiasm . And when , in the depth of winter , , the unstoried standard of America waved in hostile bravery before the iron fortress of Quebec , and the snows of a Canadian winter were darkened with an array that had toiled to that battle ground , through an unexplored and arctic wilde*'ness ,  --  even the conquest of Wolfe paled in splendor before the defeat of the hardy revolutionists . Certainly , to one who , like Burr , had seen that handful of devoted men , struggling for a space of sixty days , through savage wastes , enduring every conceivable privation of nakedne*s and hunger , for the only hope of an eager battle with their country 's foe , it might have seemed anything but impossible , thirty years afterwards , to wrest the golden spoils of Mexico from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller number of hardy adventurers , of a similar school , beneath a southern sun , and through regions of spontaneous fertility . Burr was present at the fatal assault upon Quebec , in-which the co. lonies sustained the greatest loss of the war , in the life of Montgomery , who , from all concurrent testimony , appears to have been endowed with those happy qualities which would have rendered him second only to the Father of his Country , had he lived to assist him in establishing its independenee . Upon Arnold , after his death , devolved the duty of leading back the troops , and during the march , Burr with characteristic volatility ' * deserted the army , in quest , as he said , of more active service . On arriving at New York , his connexions and character procured him an invitation from Gen. Washington to reside with him , which he accepted , but soon felt the restraint of that severe and virtuous eye so irksome , that he became restless and dissatisfied , and meditated ; even then , retirement from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Governor Hancock , who procured him admission into the staff of good old General Putnam , then in command at New York , as aide-de-camp . Here the brilliant young soldier was more at ease . He had exchanged the unrelaxing duty of head quarters , and the hateful vigilance of Washington 's sagacious penetration , for the military ease of the simple Putnam 's household , and the congenial license of a large city , under martial law . Burr , nevertheless , appears to have engaged with ardor in the peculiar studies of the soldier , and , of course , soon acquired distinction among his more simple companions , as a tactician and disciplinarian . He was present in the action on Long Island Heights , August 28 , 1776 , and distinguished himself by his coolness and intrepidity during the subsequent night retreat to New York . In the evacuation , soon after , of the city , Burr 's intrepid presence of mind was the means of preventing a detachment of the army , under Gen // Knox , from being cut off . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burr was appointed Lieut . Col. of Malcolm 's regiment , and all the active duty and superintendence of the corps devolved upon him . In September , 1777 , in this capacity , he performcd the only exploit of his military career . The British having detached a marauding expedition , two thousand strong , for the purpose of plundering the country west of the Hudson river , and capturing the public stores , Burr broke up his quarters , and by forced marches having reached their camp before morning , fell upon their picket with such fury that they retreated in disorder , leaving several prisoners and some dead upon the field , and so alarmed the main body with the fears of a general attack , that they decamped precipitately , leaving their booty behind . In 1777 , Burr 's regiment , with the rest of the army , wintered at Valley Forge , and in this situation his inauspicious hatred of General Washington seems to have become con* firmed . He , of course , adhered to the party of Lee and Gates , and entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident , at the battle of Monmouth , June 28,1778 , ( which , by the way , is here stated for the first time ,  --  being no where corroborated in the contemporary accounts of the action ) seems to exhibit an instance of a spirit of insubordination , and disposition to assume the responsibility of independent action , to the derangement of the plans of the Commander-in-chief , which is by no means redeemed by the gallantry that might prompt the attempt . A slight insinuation of censure , against the latter , is conveyed , . - which , however , springing from the exacerbated feelings of Colonel Burr , falls utterly harmless to the ground . Lieut . Colonel Bunner is , doubtless , meant as the commander of the Pennsylvania detachment . " Shortly after the action had become general , Burr discovered a body of the enemy coming from the borders of a wood to the southward . He instantly put his brigade in motion for the purpose of checkin them . It was necessary to ceoss a morass , over which a bridae was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania detachment , and that he would bring up the rear with his own regiment . After a part of the brigade was over the brid*e , Colonel Barber , aid to General Washington , rode up , and said that the orders of the commander-inchief were that he should bait . Colonel Burr remonstrated . He said his men , in their present position , were exposed to the fire of the enemy , and that his whole brigade must now*ross the bridge before they could halt with any safety . Colonel Barber repeated that the orders of General Washington were peremptory that be should halt , which was accordin , , ly done , and the brigade , in their divided state , suffered severely . Lieutenant-colonel Dummer was killed ; Colonel Burr 's horse was shot under him ; and those who had crossed the brid*e were compelled to retreat . " Early in 1779 , Burr was appointed to command the lines in Westchester ; having a command of about 300 men . The duties of this post he discharged with much vigilance and activity ; repressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring order and confidence to the surrounding country . Three months , however , of this kind of service , tired him tboroughly of revolutionary // warfare , and in spite of a letter from his general , McDougall , in which he was asked with surprise , whether he thought of " quitting the ground when business was to be done , " - he as1*ed , and obtained permission to retire from the service ; having been in the army littIe more than three years . Soon after his resignation , Burr , then in the twenty-fourth year of his age , commenced the study of the law , and after severe preparation , he was admitted as attorney , in January , 1782 , the obje tions of the bar having been overruled by the court , and his service in the army recognized as study . In July of the same year , he was married to Mrs. Prevost , th' widow of a British colonel , an elegant and accomplished lady . The correspondence between Colonel Burr and this lady , during bis various absences , gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters place his character in a favorable light at this early period of his life , they are interesting as specimens of a vigorous and elastic mind , unbending itself from the more engrossin0 cares of life . These letters worthily occupy a large portion of the first volume . In the spring of 1784 , the political life of Col. Burr , commenced , by bis election to the State legislature . After this term , he remained in a private station , until 1788 , when the animated discussion , respecting the Federal Constitution , called into full activity every diversity of political sentiment in the Union . Into the exciting discussions of that time , it is entirely unnecessary that we should enter . The anti-federal , since Democratic , party , were far from being opposed to that great instrument , as a whole , hut they strained every nerve to popularize its provisions in some important details , and to add to the security of the freedom it guaranteed , by some judicious amendments . As a body , they had emphatically been the working men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , at what they thought was an attempt to impose upon them ag*in , after the toil and blood of a seven years ' war , all the oppressive power and cumbrous machinery of government , of which they had so dearly rid themselves . Their opponents , on the contrary , embraced not merely all those attached to prerogative and power , and conscientiously averse to trusting the peo le , but many who wished quietly to revive , under its enactments , the doctrines and practice of the old regime ; and , also , all those who had taken up arms against the Revolutio* itself , and remained recusants and tories to the last . Consequently the bitterness of feeling , engendered between the two parties , was deep and lasting ; and on their first marshalling for the civil conflict , the lines of demarcation were as strongly ( Irawn , as they ever afterwards continued . The Federal party , in the elections that ensued , were led on by men of consummate ability , and made such use of the general dread of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Articles of Confederation* // that they triu ephed by very large majorities ; but at the election for Governor , in 1789 , the Democratic party re-elected their candidate , George Clinton , although the Federalists , with their usual tact , had *allied und r the banner of Judge Yates , one of the strongest democrats of the day , and a member of the Convention which framed the Constitution . At this time we find Burr in the ranks of the Federalists , and even an acti -e member of the same committee with Alexander hamilton . This circumstance , although but slightly noticed by Mr. Davis , was not forgotten by the Democratic party ; and , at a more important period of Burr 's life , formed a heavy link in the lona chah of accusation which so completely manacled his political character . The same party could not , however , contain two such spirits as Burr and G neral Hamilton . They were already rivals at the bar , and it was probably a hope of eclipsing the political influence of the spoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his final adhesio to the Democratic party . Governor Clinton did not show himself insensible to the value of such an acquisition , and , forgetting old animo ities , appointed Burr Attorney General of the State ; and soon after , on the expiration of General Schuyler 's term , he was sent to the Senate of the United States , as the one best qualified to oppose the funding 3chemes of Hamilton , which Schuyler , who was llamii*on 's fatherin-law , had ardently supported . As a Senator , Burr was by no means distinguished ; he maintained , however , a respectable standing in the body , and supported the leading democratic measures 4th i*pirit and effect ; particularly the opposition to Jay 's treaty , respecting which his conduct obtained much applause . He was , however , accused , during his term , of having a continual itching for the Governorship of his State , and with having ineffectually intrigued to procure a nomination for the office in 1792 , and again in 17% , in opposition to his former opponent , Judge Yates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good graces of General Washington , which he lost during the revolutionary war . Washington 's sagacity , uprightness , and good sense , were unequalled* He never had the least confidence in Colonel Burr , and his biographer gives the following anecdote , which we quote , as an instance of this , and as too curious an incident in Burr 's history , and in that of the times , to be passed over . C ' About this period the Democratic party were hiahly incensed against the Presi* dent for continuin5 Gou erneur Morris as a minister of the French Republic . T Executive Provisory Council had requested his recal . He was considered a monarchist , and hostile to the revolution . Many of the Opposition Senators had spoken with great freedom of the policy of General Washin on in this particular . Thess remarks having been communicated to the President , he expressed , inlbrmally , a willin5ness to recal Mr. Morris , and to nominate a member of the Opposition , if they would desi*nate a suit . ble person . In consequence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the most distinguished members of ths House , had a conference , and resolved on recommending Colonel Burr . Mr. Madi. son , Mr. Monroe , and another member of Conaress whose name is not recollected , // were delegated to wait on the President and communicate the wishes of the party- . General Wnshington paused for a few moments , and then remarked , that he had made it a rule of life never to recommend or nominate any person , for a high and re* sponsihle situation , in whose integrity he had not confidence ; that , wanting confidence in Colonel Burr , he could not nominate him ; hut that it would give him areat pleasure to meet their wishes , if they would desi*nate an individual in whom he could confide . The committee returned and reported the result of their conference . The Senator adhered unanimously to their first ontination , and the s e dele*ates waited upon the President and reiterated the adherence of their friends to Colonel . Burr . Whereupon General Washington , with some warmth , remarked that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominate you , Mr. Madison , or you , Mr. Monro . * The former replied that he had long since made up hi* mind never to leave his country , a d respectfully declined the offer . They retired* and reported the result of their second interview . The democratic gentlemen were not less infiexihle , and instructed their dele6ates to say to the President that they would make no other recommendation . On the third visit they were received hy Mr. Randolph , Secretary of State , to whom they made the communication , hut who considered it indecorous , knowing the President 's feelings , to repeat the message . " In 1797 , not 1798 , as the biographer states , Burr 's term as Senator , having expired , he was again elected to the Assembly , and in the same year he was nominated for the Vice Presidency , and received 30 votes for the office ; which affords a correct estimate of his standing at that period with the democratic party oftheUnion , though the circumstance is not mentioned by Mr. Davis . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not duplicity , tohis party . His want of interest in the measures of his political associates , and his forwarding indirectly the designs of the Federalists , were matters of subsequent and severe complaint ; and he was openly accused of having , by absenting himself from voting , negatively assistcd the election of Foote , a warm personal friend , though a bitter opponent of democracy , to the Council of Appointment , certainly , by far the roost important party office in the State . When we reflect , that in that body , conjointly with the Governor , was vested the sole power of appointment to all the offices in the State , any mere neglect in a representative , which would have the effect of arming such an influence against his immediate constituents , affords no slight evidence of a want of faithful honesty to his party . lie was also accused , and not without grounds , at the same time , of playing into the hands of the Federalists , when the high-handed measures of John Adams spread a universal reign of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriation of 1 , *00,000 , to fortify the harbour of New York , in the extra session which Gov . Jay called for the purpose of combatting the presidential speetres of French invasion and war . But Burr has left a monument of his legislative conduct at this period , which is peculiary his own , and which , cxtendina to our own times , bids fair to transmit to more distan epochs the im1 ress and the consequences of its paternity . This is the celebrated Manhattan Banking Company of New York ; for which he dexterously smuggled a perpetual charter through the Legisla* // ture , under the pretence that he was providing a supply of pure and wholesome water for the city ,  --  a dangerous power of unlimited banking , limited trading , stock-jobbing , manufacturing , or any other means of obtaining or creating money , being granted to any foreigner or citizen , into whose hands the direction , or the stock might fall , by an artful clause " permitting the surplus capital of $2,000,000 , " to be employed " in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , or of the State of New York . " Under this accommodating provision , the astonished public soon saw an extensive and powerful banking institution organized in New York , which continues its beneficent operations of loan and dis .. count to the present time , while the absence of the concomitant benefit of a " pure and wholesome water " has long been the standing opprobrium of the empire city . If we are to believe the newspapers of the time , the creature showed itself liberally grateful for the exertions of its creator , and it was not until the demands of a rising politician had been gratified to the extent of a moderate fortune , that the thankful stockholders were compelled to vote him out of its direction . In the last year of the last century , a great crisis had arrived in the history of the parties in this country , if not in that of the country itself . The gloomy reign of federalism had brooded like an incubus upon the republican institutions which had been purchased by the Revolution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bold and daring measures , had been gradually augmented until it became an insupportable burthen to the people ; and an immense majority were convinced that on the election of the successor to John Adams , as dear a liberty as they once had fought for , was involved , and that nothing short of a complete change of executive policy could restore the governing power to the standard of republican simplicity from which it had so dangerously swerved . The history of that time has yet to be written , and a memorable and instructive lesson will it unfold to the Democracy of the country . In sincerest truth , it may be called a time of more dangerous peril to the great American experiment of self-government , and to popular institutions , than the darkest hour of the long contest with Great Britain . Every democrat in the land felt the vital question brought home to him , whether all the great civil and moral results of the Revolution were to be tamely suffered to go by default ; and not unfrequently , in the burning discussions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of the Puritan Colonel , Titus , to Oliver Cromwell , " Are we , who would not submit to the Lion , to lie down and be quietly do. - voured by the Wolf ? " Hence , it was that both parties nerved themselves for conflict with a resolution , and fixedness of purpose , which seemed to consecrate effort into the solemn energy of duty , and argued the extremes of utter prostration or of ultimate *nd lasting victory to either side . // Upon one man , in that trying time , were the eyes of the whole country fixed with an earnestness of trust and devotion , or of fear and hatred , that placed him in a moral prominence which no mere politician could ever have commanded . And justly did the hearts of his countrymen repose their confidence upon Thomas Jefferson . His principles of liberty , based upon the most benerous and expansive benevolence , and regulated by a philosophy perhaps too keen and clear , were never permitted to swerve for an instant from that original purity , and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xvorship in the immortal eloquence of the Declaration of Independence . Calm , serious , and unpresuming , the love of the people sought him out in lofty stations , where the new success of those virgin principles had placed him , and found him still the same , undazzled by elevatio , and unseduced by power , sincerely endeavouring to carry into effect the mighty purposes which rested upon his soul with all the responsibility of a trust . In the cabinet of Washington , his simple and righteous principles of government were brought into perpetual conflict with adverse influences , and were maintained with a simplicity and truth , that tested fully to the people the value of his character , and his importance to the public weal . In the subsequent administration of John Adams , the honest opinion of a large portion of the Union was , that they had been baulked of their wishes , and during its progress every opponent despaired but himself . Undismayed and unshaken ,  --  in the perilous times , when power sought to entrench itself against the rights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , he was found true to himself , and devoutly confident that that " GOOD CAUSE " which had survived the dangers of warfare and of anarchy , would not be betrayed by its disciples and its believers , at the solemn crisis of its complete success , into the permanent keeping of politicians who neither acknowledged nor believed it . Unquestionably the most remarkable historical incident connected with this great political conflict , was the imminent danger which the popular cause sustained of an unanticipated defeat by the desperate and sustained attempt of a political advent *rer , who had launched himself opportunely upon the mighty tide of public effort , which was setting in towards regeneration , and had been borne upon its triumphant swell , until the collision of his treacherous selfishness had all but wrecked the noble ark of the Democratic cause , as it was just entering the haven of success . And this is the true claim of Aaron Burr upon history . It is this , coupled with his subsequent attempt , which has given him the place , in the political annals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were it not that the weakness of the attempt , made in the present volumes , to blacken the lustrous fame of Jefferson , and to whitewash into public virtue the insidious duplicity of such a rival , in some degree atones for its // wickedness , we should be inclined to place the present work among the most dangerous impositions ever attempted upon the credulity of the public . The first of the statements by which Mr. Davis has hoped to accomplish his purpose , we confess takes us by surprise , and seems to giwe the authenticity of contemporary evidence to the incredible assertion that Governor George Clinton was a bitter opponent of Jefferson , at the very time he was supporting him with all the immense influence of his party for the Presidency . We request the reader 's attention to the assertions marked in Italics , in the following extract . Mr. Davis is describing the interviexv at Colonel Burr 's house with Governor Clinton , previous to the election of 1800 , at which , he asserts , the assent of the Governor was obtained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states : " An imperfect sketch of the scene at the house of Colonel Burr was published in the year 1802 , in a pamphlet udder the signature of Aristides . The following is extracted from it . The note of reference here given is also extracted . Its correctness was never publicly denied by either of the aentlemen named . There exists no longer any reason for concealment on the subject ; and it is therefore now admitted that this note was written from memorandums made at the time by the author of this volume . ExTaAcT . Governor Clinton , however , remained unmoved by the most earnest solicitations ; a. d , with matchless firmness , resisted the arguments of Mr. Burr , who forcibly a*. scrted that it was a ri ht inherent in the community to command the services of an individual when the nature of public exigencies seemed to require it . He was in. flexible to the last , and then was nominated and elected without a distinct expression of his approbation . Justice , however , induces me to acknowled*e , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plausible and potent . He explicitly declared that he had long entertained an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Jefferson 's talents as a statesman and his firmness as a republican . That he conceived him an *ccomodatin* trimmer , who would chan e with times , and bend to circumstances for the purposes of personal promotion . Impressed with these sentiments , he could not , with propriety , he said , acquiesce in the elevation of a man destitute of the qualifications essential to the good administration of the government ; and added other expressions too vulgar to he here repeated . But , ' said he , with energy , if you , Mr Burr , was the candidate for the Presidential chair , I would act with pleasure and with vigor. ' * * " It is so notorious that these were Governor Clinton 's sentiments , that it is scarcely necessary to produce authority to prove it . To remove , however , every doubt in the reader 's mind , I will refer him to Mr. David Gelston , Mr. John Mills , Mr. John Swartwout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sentiments , and many others more disrespectful , if poseible , were uttered . It was at the house of Mr. Burr , who , anticipating the evil consequencee that at that critical moment would result from such conduct in Governor Clinton , insisted , before he left the house , that he should promise his friends to desist from using such language previous to or during the election . This was very reluctantly complied with on the part of Mr. Clinton . " Notwithstanding this , they were continually reiterated by his son , who publicly and loudly animadverted upon the character of Mr. Jefferson with the most vul*ar severity . Similar sentiments were certainly entertained by all Governor Clinton 's connexions , as tbei* conduct during the election clearly evinced . Mr. Dewitt Clinton , through the whole con* test , never appeared at the poll , but observed the most shameful indifference and inactivity . " ' // 232 Aaron Burr . Here is given an extract from a work , published when those scenes were yet fresh ; and Mr. Davis clinches the testimony with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by calling particular attention to the fact , that the note of reference was written from memoranda made at the time by himself ( the author of this volume . ' ) He asserts also , " that the correctness of these statements was never publicly denied by either of these gentlemen , " intending altogether to convey the impression that Governor Clinton was inimical to the election of Jefferson , and a believer and propagator of those contemptuous scurrilities against him , which it has been the constant aim and endeavour of his opponents for fifty years to pass off for history or public opinion . The pamphlet under the signature of Aristides made some noise on its publication . It advanced the same novelties five-and-thirty years ago which Mr. Davis plumes himself on bringing forward now-it was an elaborate defence of Burr against the closely fitting charges , with which the press was ringing , of his traitorous collusion with the federalists to place himself in the Presidency , and won for the anonyinous author all that applause which extreme boldness of assertion , wielded with dexterity against an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command in political controversy . As , in some of the editions of this celebrated partisan diatribe , this note of reference was adopted into the text , and printed without any asterisks or typographical distinctions whatever , Mr. Davis , in thus avowing its paternity , has at least done some service to the memory of the author , ( well enough understood to have been Judge Win . P. Van Ness , ) - though but little to his own object ,  --  in assuming the responsibility of its veracity . In doing so , he doubtless presumed that , at this late day , it would pass unchallenged , though it would not impose on any one familiar with the controversy of the time . The motive of its introduction is obvious ; - if the biographer of Burr could mask his assault upon Jefferson behind the name of Clinton , a high preliminary advantage would be attained , and an unsuspected authority adduced in the warfare against his memory , which seems to be one of the principal objects of the work . But the chain wants a link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay , worse than fails him , is turned upon himself . Aristides ' version of Governor Clinton 's sentiments , Mr. Davis 's strong assertion to the contrary notwithstanding , did meet with prompt and indignant denial at the time . The sagacity of public justice was not so easily duped . " A reply to Aristides " soon afterwards appeared-put forth avowedly by the Clinton party , and so directly by the sanction of its head , that Aristides himself avowed his belief that De Witt Clinton was the " real author , ****though it was // acknowledged by Cheetham . In this pamphlet the same story is quoted , and the reference for its authenticity to Davis , and another , is stated to be unnecessary , for the reason that , as violators of confidence , their " veracity was not to be relied on . " It then gives an authorized statement of what Governor Clinton did say on the occasion . The account of the interview , there given , is summed up as follows : " From that language Aristides has fabricated the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of Burr . Governor Clinton said nothing of Mr. Jeffer .. son 's talents as a statesman ,  --  of these , I have every reason to believe he has the most exalted opinion . Mr. Jefferson has not in the Union a sincerer friend ; a more ardent admirer of his administration . Nor did he question his firmness as a republican ; of this Governor Clinton is sensible Mr. Jefferson has furnished the most satisfactory and incontrovertible proof . Nor is it true that Governor Clinton remarked , as is asserted by Aristides , that if Mr. Burr was the candidate for the Presidential chair , he would act with pleasure and with vigor . He had no idea , at the time , that Mr Burr aspired to the Presidency ; and then , as now , he would be the last to wish him at the head of the government . " We have devoted too much space to an incident so trifiing ,  --  but it met us at the threshold of our investigation , and seemed to form a point so imposing in Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex frde Herculem , we could not decline the obligation to exhibit the peculiar quality of the armament with which the biographer of Aaron Burr proceeds to the task of destroying the reputation of Thomas Jefferson . In the Presidential election of 1800 , it is well known , that the republican candidates succeeded . Jefferson and Burr , each received seventy-three votes ,  --  John Adams , 65 ,  --  Pinckney , 64 . An equality , however , was not anticipated ,  --  still less was the consequence to which it led . In the original plan of the campaign , it had been intended that one of the southern electors should drop Burr , so as to prevent what , as was anticipated , would be the worst consequence of an equality ,  --  the mere formality of a House election . But as the report had been purposely circulated that Burr had been , or would be , dropped by two electors at the north , and as the balance of parties was too nice to permit the hazard of another elector doing the same , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the republican party was so desirous to avoid . No sooner was it ascertained that Adams and Pinckney had lost their election , and that there was a tie between Jefferson and Burr , which would of necessity bring the election to the House , than the Union was filled with intrigues . The Federal party hung their hopes upon the trial with the desperate tenacity of a gambler , who finds he may have another chance for all or nothing , after his game has been lost . From that moment Burr grew into consequence . To use an extraordinary simile of Curran 's , .. - . becoming buoyant by corruption , he rose as he rotted , ' and soon // had all eyes directed to his movements . He was the centre and sole object of all these intrigues . Needy , selfish , unsteady , and ambitious , a dazzling prize seemed presented to his grasp . Success would place him above the reach of the betrayed ; defeat would but leave him as he was . Aaron Burr was not the man to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire revive , as they concentrated round the infatuated man , who foresaw not the necessity of fate , that would inevitably make him the victim , if he became the tool . We have often thought that there was no period of Jefferson 's whole career , in which he showed to more advantage than in this trying time . Heated as was the occasion , with more than furnace power , his character passed through the fiery ordeal , unhurt as the children of holy writ . Self-confident as serene , we find him at one time writing to his rival , undated in the universal confidence of being the people 's choice ; and again , when the political horizon was overcast , to all the country besides himself , with portentous gloom , and men grew dark , as the muttered purpose of a new treason was first noised abroad ,  --  his confidence was cheerful , since the alternafive of his own rejection , was still a republican administration. * He was superior to defeat ,  --  and never merited political success so well , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ,  --  and by a casualty he could never have foreseen . We have no intention here , of re-opening , with Mr. Davis , the question of Mr. Burr 's participation and connivance in the intrigues of which he was the object . No public topic of interest in the party or personal annals of our country was ever discussed with more keen and earnest scrutiny ,  --  - with a more resolute sagacity of justice , - with a more persevering spirit of unresting vigilance ,  --  - but , we may say , of the present argument in the controversy , that if ever the character of the man , giving confirmation strong as holy writ , to the most powerful mass of presumptive evidence ever produced against an unconvicted criminal , permitted us to have a doubt on the subject , the perusal of the present work , written by a confidant of every transaction , would have replaced it with complete conviction . We request the attention of our readers to the following extract from Mr. Davis* s account of this exciting contest . We will certainly give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an astounding charge against Mr. Jefferson 's conduct , in this remarkable election . The passage is much too long for our present limits , but in justice to the great interests of truth involved , we can not omit a line : The Aurora of the 16th of February , 1801 , remarks , that " the tellers declared that there was some informality in the votes of Georgia ; but , believing them to he true votes , reported them as such . " No explanation of the nature of this informality was given ; nor is it known that any has ever been given since . Had it been announced // at the time , there can be no doubt it would have proved fatal to the election of Mr. Jefferson . Whether the interest of our country would or would not have been thereby promoted , is not a question for discussion here . By the Constitution of the United States , at that time , it was provided , Art . 2 , sec. 1 , " The Electors shall meet in their respective States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom one , at least , shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves . And they shall make list of all the persons voted for , and of the number of votes for e'eh ,  --  which list they shall sign and certify , and transmit , sealed , to the sent of 0overnment of the United States , directed to the President of the Senate . The President of the Senate shall , in e presence of the Senate and House of Representatives , open all the certificates , and the votes shall then be counted . The person having the greatest number of votes shall be President , if such number be a majority of the whole nu2aber of electors appointed ; and if there be more than one who have such a majority , and have an equal number of votes , then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose , by ballot , one of them for President ; and if no person have a majority , then from thefive highest on the list the said Hou e shall , in like manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , the votes shall be taken by States ,  --  and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice . " From the above extract it will be seen that the Constitution is imperative as to the form and manner in which the electoral returns are to be made . The ceremony of openin0 was performed in the presence of the two Houses . The package of a State havin0 been opened by the Yice President , it was handed by him to the tellers . Mr. Jefferson was the presiding officer . On opening the package endorsed Georgia votes , it was discovered to be totally irregular . The statement now about to be given is derived from an honorable gentleman , a member of Congress from the State of New York during the administration of Mr. Jefferson , nad yet living in this State . He says , that Mr. Wells ( a teller on the part of the Senate , ) informed him that the envelope was blank ; that the return of the votes was not authenticated by the signatures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside or the inside of the envelope , or in any other manner ; that it merely stated on the inside , that the votes of Georgia were , for Thomas Jefferson four , and for Aaron Burr four , without the signature of any other person whatsoever . Mr. Wells added , that he was very undecided as to the proper course to be pursued by the tellers . It was , however , suggested by one of them that the paper should be handed to the presiding officer , without any statement from the tellers , except that the return was informal ; that he consented to this arrangement under the firm conviction that Mr. Jefferson would announce the nature of the informality from the chair ; but , to his utmost surprise , he ( Mr. Jefferson ) rnpidly declared that the votes of Georgia were , four for Thomas Jefferson , and four for Aaron Burr , without noticing their informality , and in a hurried manner put them aside , and then broke the seals , and handed to the tellers the package from the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jefferson looked at the paper purporting to contain a statement of the electoral vote of the State of Georgia , his countenance changed , but that the decision and promptitude with which he acted on that occasion , convinced him of that which he ( a federalist ) and his party had always doubted , that is to say , Mr. Jefferson 's decision of character , at least when his own interest was at hazard . Mr. Wells further stated , that if the votes of Georgia had not been thus counted , as it would have brought all the candidates into the House ,  --  and Mr. Pinckney among the number ,  --  Mr. Jefferson could not have been elected President . The same honorable member of Congress further stated , that some few years after receivin* , the above information from Mr. Wells , he became intimately acquainted with John Nicholas , who was one of the tellei*s referred to , and who had removed from Virginia into the western part of the State of New York . Mr. Nicholas gave the honorable member the same statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from Mr. Wells . Mr. Nicholas was a warm personal and poli // tical friend of Jefferson , and declared that he never felt so astounded in his life as when he discovered the irregularity . He claimed some credit for the adroit manner in which he had managed Mr. Rutledge , so as to obtain his consent to hand the paper to Mr. Jefferson , without public explanation from the tellers , and which was effected by a conciliatory appeal to the magnanimity of the member from South Carolina . The whole number of electoral votes given at the election in 1800 , was one hund.red and thirty-eight : necessary to a choice , seventy . Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Burr had each , according to the return made , seventy-three . Geor*ia gave four votes . If that number had been deducted from Jefferson and Burr , as illegally returned , of which there is no doubt , they would have had only sixty-nine votes each ; cons. - quently they would not have had , in the language of the Constitution , " a majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of which a choice of President must be made , would have been Mr. Jefferson , Mr. Burr , Mr. Adams , and Mr. Piackney . The federal members would then have said to the republicans , we will unite with you in the choice of either of the gentlemen presented to the house except Mr. Jefferson ; and if the government is to be brought to a termination by our failure to elect a President , the responsibility will be on you . And it is believed , that in such a case the doubtful members who were sighing for office , if any such there were , would have rejected the su*gestion in toto. * Here , then , we have a narrative , minutely circumstantial , of the most serious crime ever laid to the charge of a public culprit ,  --  and from deliberate testimony , Mr. Jefferson must be branded , in the list of American Presidents , as an usurper and a cheat . Sixtus the Fifth placed the tiara on his brow by a bold maneuvre of resolute ambition ,  --  and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful energy of his conduct ;  --  but the severer virtue of a republic could not screen even the most favorite character of her children from the eternal infamy of such an act as this . How then shall the friends of Jefferson defend his character from an assault so fatal . The answer is simple indeed ,  --  the entire superstructure , argument , inference , and all , has not even the semblance of truth for its foundation . In no particular , or circumstance , is the allegation of this historian true ,  --  in the letter or the spirit . The votes of Georgia were authenticated by the signature of the electors , both on the outside and the inside of the letter ,  --  and the mmutest scrutiny can not detect a single discrepancy , or tbe omission of a formality prescribed by the wording of the law. * What , then , are * Let the reader compare the document itself ( preserved in the archives of the Senate ) with the description of it by Mr. Davis .

But we find this already long article grows upon us . In going over the ground so far , we have been compelled , from the necessity of our limits , to omit many points of interest ,  --  and our notes for the remaining portion of the book are so numerous , that we must altogether omit extended notice of the stormy scenes of the Presidential election . No historic doubt now rests upon the question , that the iron firmness of the democratic party , at that time , saved the country from a dangerous extremity , which can never occur again . For seven successive days and nights from the 11th to the 17th of February , 1801 , was this extraordinary excitement kept up ,  --  the republicans adhering with inflexible firmness to their duty , in voting for Mr. Jefferson ,  --  and the federalists as constantly , though not as resolutely , during the same period , continuing to vote for Burr . This party , conscious of the weakness of their cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaited them , in the event of Jefferson 's success , hesitated at no means to avert their Certified to be a true list of the electors of Georgia , under the direction of the Legislature of that State .

GRAYBILL , DENNIS SMELT , DD . BLACESHEAR . The letter is post-marked Dec. 3. // fate . In the beginning of the contest they passed a resolution that the balloting should be continued without the adjournment of the House ,  --  with a view to make it a mere trial of physical strength , and exclude Mr. Nicholson , a republican member from Maryland , who was confined to his bed by sickness ,  --  and whose absence would have given the vote of Maryland to Burr . But this , eventually , was an efficient means of their defeat . With a feeling worthy of the best days of Greece ,  --  during a heavy snow storm , the invalid had his bed removed to the Capitol ,  --  where , attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , depositing his vote in every ballot , and had , finally , the satisfaction and reward of seeing his devoted firmness the means of giving the unanimous vote of his State to the man of the people . Thus , finding there was no probability of shaking the republicans , who , in each of the thirtysix ballotings , gave the vote of eight States in a solid phalanx to Jefferson , the federalists gloomily surrendered . The four members from Maryland , and the one from Vermont , of that party , who had ( livide ( l the vote of their respective States , putting in blanks ,  --  and thus permitting their opponents to make up the number of ten for their candidate . During the whole period Jefferson never received a federal vote , nor Burr a republican one ,  --  and that entire party , indignant and disgusted at the open attempt of the federalists to defeat the clearly expressed will of the majority , naturally directed their attention and suspicious scrutiny to the conduct of one of their own candidates , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow them . Circumstances in the previous part of Burr 's political course , and his general character for subtlety and intrigue , lent a color to these unfavorable impressions , which , in the progress of the virulent discussion that ensued , were completely verified , by a moral certainty of proof convincing to every rational mind . It is certain , that from the effects of that discussion Burr never recovered . Long before the close of his term , as Vice President , it was perceived that his office alone prevented him from sinking into utter insignificance ; and his return to private life was a return to an ignominious obscurity , and political disgrace , from which he never emerged , but to the darkest notoriety of imputed crime . We entirely acquit ourselves of the necessity of going over this controverted ground , step by step , with Mr. Davis . We have shown what reliance may be placed upon the only new facts bearing upon this discussion , which he has advanced ; his remaining evidence , though more authentic , wants the important requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mis-statement , before examining the specific charges against Burr , of collusion with the Federalists , viz : that the contradictions , he now introduces , rarely ever met the public eye except through the federal newspapers . ' On the contrary , the letters of denial now brought forward , with an air of cbsing // the controversy in triumph , were all published in the democratic papers of the day , and were made the subjects of a scrutiny so searching , they but confirmed what they were designed to overthrow . The nature of the case forbade the possibility of proving the various allegations with judicial exactness ; but , no one can calmly read the voluminous statements which were brought forward on both sides of the question , without feeling that the dark stain had been fixed upon Burr 's political honor , beyond the power of removal , and that his party fealty had been tampered with and betrayed . The statements respecting the suppression of Wood 's History , need not now be examined , as having no farther connexion with the subject , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusations against the character of the Vice President . Wood was a weak and vain creature , and though of good attainments , perfectly venal ;  --  and had his miserable production come before the world on its own merits , it would never have been heard of . But it certainly was an exciting and suspicious circu:nstance that a prominent leader of the Democratic party , enjoying their second highest office , should privately have agreed to pay a large sum for suppressing a history of the men and measures so justly odious to therm , as a body , and of which the widest promulgation could not fail to exercise a salutary influence on the popular mind ;  --  but before the excitement of the transaction , with the book , had died away in its own absurdities , the press and the public mind were completely engrossed in the earnest discussion of the far more important question which had , in a manner , grown out of it , whether the Vice President was not politically treacherous and unsafe , and had not actually connived at , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to set aside the election of Mr. Jefferson , in his own favor ,  --  an attempt which was universally regarded as the most flagrant outra ge on popular rights , since the adoption of the Constitution ; and as a disgraceful effort to obtain an office never intended for him , by means , which , in his case , would have been clearly , at the best , a legislative usurpation . The enumeration by Mr. Davis of the grounds of suspicion against Burr , is not complete ; - we will add a few in addition to the cata .. logue he has vouchsafed us . He was accused of a systematic design to effect this purpose , from the time of his nomination as Vice President , on the same ticket with Jefferson , and even that nomination , it was asserted , though , we think , on insufficient grounds , he obtained by undue means to the exclusion of Governor Clinton . He was believed to have impressed his views on Mr. Lispenard , one of the electors for New York , and the suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Chairman of the Electoral Cob Jege , and Mr. Pierre Van Cortland , who playfully insisted on writing the ticket for each elector . Had Jefferson been dropped by a single // elector , Burr would , of course , have been made President by the primal vote . So that the importance of this obscure incident is immense . Yet it was directly charged in a letter addressed to Burr himself , which appeared in the American Citizen . It is obviously , however , insusceptible of direct proof , and is inadmissible as evidence-beyond the fact . establ*shed by it , that such a suspicion was then entertained and provided against , even by the little piece of management mentioned . The specious letter of Burr to General Smith , on which so much stress is laid by Mr. Davis , it was said , was intended to lull the Democratic party by false professions ,  --  and the proof was distinct that Burr knew , when he wrote it , the equality of votes between himself and Jefferson. * An article published as a commentary on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly shows that it was considered by that party as an indirect adherence to their sch3mes by Burr . That article began thus : " There was inserted in yesterday 's Federalist , a letter from Colonel Burr , which we venture to predict can be conceived in no other light than as an additional evidence of his fitness to fill the Presidential chair . " It then goes on with a train of argument to prove that the vote of the electors , without reference to previous considerations , presented both candidates on an equal footing to the House of Representatives , and ended thus , " Colonel Burr ought not consistently with the principles he has confessed by his proxy , General Smith , to interfere , in any manner whatever ; "  --  and this was precisely the cue on which Burr acted during the election . The excited controversialists of the time , exposing its flimsy professions , addressed the following language to Colonel Burr , of which it is impossible not to perceive the force . CC But , sir , if you had meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it was of a nature so equivocal as to be inefficacious . Had you really meant to disclaim all competition with Mr. Jefferson , ' there is one way , which must have been obvious to yourself at the time , in which you might have done so effectually . " You ought , sir , to have said it is evidently the wish of the people to place Mr. Jefferson at the head of the Government ; and it is probable , from the usual conduct of the federalists , that , to disappoint the people , they may attempt to place the administration in my hands . I should cordially contemn so improper an act . I will never accept it from them . Should th y by menace or by intrigue , by force or by fraud , be enabled to commit the Executive power to my guidance , I will instantly re- ' sign it to hint to whont t people have exclusively allotted it . I accept no office contrary to their will . " But , sir , . it did not exactly suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counteract the wishes and expectations of the people , " &amp;c. * The letter announcing this equality was published in the American Citizen of December 16 , and was received in New York , by Swartwout , the day before . It was written by Timothy Greene , said to have been Burr 's emissary . The letter to General Smith is dated December 16 , 1800. // Timothy Greene 's denial , page 91 , of being an agent of Burr 's to secure his election in South Carolina , and that of Mr. John Swartwout , of having been the medium of transmitting his communications to Burr , were proved , after their publication , to have been the merest evasions of the substantial accusation ,  --  Greene having warmly interested himself , as charged , and his information being sent to Mr. Swartwout himself , directly ,  --  instead of to Burr , in the form of lctters , under cover to him . We have mentioned already that the final news of the result of the South Carolina vote , after which Burr 's letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greene through Mr. Swartwout . The fact of conferences between Burr and the Federalists respecting the election , rests upon strong evidence , the real merits of which the denial of Ogden and Livingston , published by Mr. Davis , does not touch . It was first directly asserted on the authority of two resident and highly respectable clergymen of New York , Dr. Linn and Mr. Abed , and Burr was so conscious of the importance of their evidence , that he sent to them a request that they would sign for him a written form of certificate , to the effect that they had the information from " common report . " This they refused , on the ground , that they knew it from particular information , not from common report. *** Had they put their names to such a declaration , we should no doubt have had it here , along with the rest of Mr. Davis 's evidence to settle the question . A letter was also received in New York by a leading democratic gentleman , from a distinguished member of Congress in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and desiring them to put the Jefferson party on their guard . This letter was dated January 29th , 1801 , and mentioned , among other things , that the information was received at Washington , by a letter from a leading federalist in New York , addressed to a member of Congress in that city , and that Mr. Ogden was deputed to ascertain Burr 's views in the matter . Ogden did see Burr on the business , as he acknowledged in his letter to TrYing ; and the " leading federalist " was said to be General Hamilton . The name of the writer of the letter was withheld when it was published in the American Citizen , for fear lest it might produce a duel between him and Burr . When the controversy , however , waxed hot , it was announced by Denniston and Cheetham , that the writer 's name would be given up , on the application of General Hamilton , or on his public denial of having written such a letter . This was on the 11th of December , 1802 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , page 94 , ( amounting , at best , to nothing more , than that Hamilton had not " personally " knowledge of the negotiation , ) was published the 13th of October previous . Mr. * Cheetharn 's Nine Letters on the subject of Aaron Burr 's political defection . A *etter to a friend on the conduct of the adherents of Burr , page 66 . Aristides , page 82. // Davis does not give any denial from Hamilton , dated after this remarkable publication two months subsequent ,  --  which was again still more formally repeated in the fall of 1803 , and Burr challenged to the test of requiring a public denial from Hamilton of the fact . The letter of Dr. Irving , and Mr. D. A. Ogden 's reply , published by Mr. Davis , page 95 , were in like manner made the subjects of very searching scrutiny and criticism by the Democratic press . They were shown to have artfully , hut completely , evaded the points at issue , and were pronounced " gross impositions on the public . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 97 , is withheld . Livingston was a Member of Congress , and was said to be the gentleman to whom Burr had referred the " Federal negotiator , " for an explanation of his views . This certificate , which merely states , that Burr held no communication with him , inconsistent with his letter to General Smith , was given to Burr on his own solicitation , and was dated July 27th , 1802 , when the publication of the " View " had directed general attention to his conduct ,  --  but was not published until April 24 , 1803 , when it leaked out in the Evening Post , on the last day of the New York election , and was circulated in handbills and placards all over the city . Mr. Livingston was then Mayor of New York , and promptly published an explanation ,  --  in which he did away with the impression created by that use of his certificate ; denying that he had ever given Burr authority to refer any one to him " for an explanation of his views or wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a " Federal gentleman " had called on him , to whom he made the same remark , and explicitly avowed his intention to vote for Jefferson , and his belief that a majority of the electors would do the same . Coupling this with the unsatisfactory nature of Ogden 's visit to Burr , as expressed itt his letter to Irving , the inference is very strong , that Burr ,  --  whose reputation for address , would seem abundantly verified by the skill with which he managed to have the chances of his position tested , to the fullest extent , without direct personal implication ,  --  was not unwilling that the arguments of the " Federal negotiator , " should be tried upon Livingston , who could have materially influenced the vote of New York in the election ; and therefore directed the negotiator to open the subject to him , and sound him on the probability of New York 's supporting Burr , in the contest . Mr. Livingston would not , therefore , permit his certificate to be used , without explanation , to exonerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered himself to be tampered with . The letter of Mr. John Swartwout , page 98 , is the last exculpatory evidence brought forward by Mr. Davis . This was also demolished at the time in a very able letter addressed to Swartwout , published in the American Citizen , and afterwards embodied in a pamphlet form with Cheetham 's Nine Letters . It was replied to by Mr. Pennington , // in answer to whose charges it was written , in the Evening Post , and it was fastened upon Swartwout , that he had written letters , advising the election of Burr , " rather than have no President " - and which were followed up immediately by other letters from Mr. William P. Van Ness , advising the election of Burr " at all events . " * But while adducing evidence to disprove the fact of Burr 's intriguing with the Federalists , why has not Mr. Davis contradicted that of Alexander Hamilton , himself ,  --  haud sordidus auctor veri ,  --  who , it was repeatedly charged , had said openly at Albany , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brockholst Livingston , and Judge Pendleton , that Burr had negotiated or intrigued with the Federalists for the Presidency , and that it could be proved in a court of justice ? This rests upon the explicit authority of Judge B. Livingston himself , who stated it , for publication , to the Editors of the Citizen ,  --  - certainly a much better authentication than written certificates , in general and artfully constructed phraseology . But it were a task as useless as it would be fatiguing and uninteresting , to go into all the details of this obsolete controversy . We have touched upon it only because Mr. Davis has assumed the enormous improbability that the whole wa* the result of a conspiracyfalse and calumnious , got up by Mr. Jefferson , and waged to consummation by him and his partisans , for the purpose of destroying Burr . Some sentences of dark eloquence are wasted on this postulate , which is as perfectly wanton and gratuitous , as several of the other assertions of these volumes , relative to this matter . Without reference to the merits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in any manner accessary to the continuance of , this embittered , and , to Burr , fatal controversy . It had no features of preconcert or conspiracy , and far from having originated in secret , or from influencing a community ignorant of Burr , it was begun by those who had known him from his youth , and who had marked every step of his political progress . It was waged and it died away under his own eye ; in the midst of ardent and able friends , who defended inch by inch the honor of their chief . It was throughout confined almost entirely to New York , and extended only to other States from the interest which both parties might be presumed to feel in a controversy so deeply affecting the character of an officer , and a politician , so distinguished as the Vice President . The struggle was not in any shape or form between Jefferson and Burr , but between the Clinton party and the Burr party of New York ; and while this embittered paper warfare , was going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed against the adherents of Clinton , and protestations of undiminished respect and attachment to Jefferson were freely used even by the warmest par * On this point see " Aristides , " ( now known to have been written by this gentleman , ) and no doubt will remain as to his having written such letters . // tisans of the Vice President , to defend him from the charges of political defection brought for ward by the unsuspected branch of the Republican party . The devotion of Mr. Davis to Colonel Burr 's interest then , excites surprise at his present hardihood . Even at that early period it was sufficient to gain for him the appellation of being his " bosom friend , " " familiar , " and " tool , " in all the intrigues of which he was suspected , and his activity and zeal in furtherance of his patron 's advancement to the Presidency was sufficiently prominent to procure him warm notice in the publications the design gave rise to . Mr. Jefferson 's refusal to gratify his hopes of a lucrative office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashing pursuit of the President to the shades of Monticello , in quest of it , are personal episodes in the history of the period , which may be revived without stain from the disrespectful language in which they are recorded , as contemporary evidence that there was , at least , one period of his life , when the biographer of Burr did not think Jefferson quite so bad as he now represents him  --  and that his enmity to him originated in a sufficient cause . The zeal and activity , if not the discretion , with which he advocated the elevation of Burr to the Presidency , were conspicuous at the time ; and that , too , by the very means which he now seems to think so disgraceful to his memory , and labors with so much effort to disprove , as a criminal stain upon his character . But the convenient Lethe , in which his own recollections of the matter seem to have been steeped , should have been applied to every history and remembrance of the event , before he made his calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insert the following extract from a publication of the time , as a commentary on the admirable qualifications of Mr. Davis , to he the historical arraigner of Jefferson in this matter , and the vindicator of the innocence of Burr , at his expense . 0At the same time Mr. Burr 's d vot tools were not idle in the city of New York . A young man of the name of Matthew L. Davis-so remarkable for his chattering , that it has always appeared strange that Mr. Burr should trust him with his secrets ,  --  this youth flew about the streets like a shnttlecock thrown from the hands ofhis master , declaring that afterthe first or a cond vote in the House of Representatives , the Republicans ought to give up Mr. Jefferson , and join the Fed ralists , to elect Mr. Burr . He declar d it as hi opinion , that any other policy would be extremely injudicious .

But being in the confidence of Mr. Burr , and known to circulate hi.v opinions , it was necessary , in order to develop the nature , and , , in some degree , the extent of the plot . " -A View of the Political Conduct of Aaron Burr , Bsq. 4. c . New York , 1802. page 48 . A little farther on the same writer gives an amusing account of Mr. Davis ' journey to Monticello in quest of a office , which ends us follows : " Such was the quixotic expedition of our little expectant ! Davis has ever since been an open opponent of the Admini ration ) ' // The obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the actors in them , and all in whom they could have reanimated the bitterness of personal feeling , have passed from the stage of life , but their opinions went to form one of the settled resuits of history ; and if Aaron Burr , in the full tide and triumph of his popularity , under the most favorable circumstances for exercising his great talents and commanding influence , fell from his proud position , irretrievably prostrate from the withering effects of a free and fearless discussion , the hope is vain , indeed , at this distance of time , and with such materials , to wash the Ethiop white , and to make the public believe that one of the greatest of American statesmen forged his claim to the proud confidence of his contemporarios , and should now be stripped of all title to the grateful remembrance of his country . Our readers will have found in the preceding narrative a faithful sketch of the public services of Colonel Burr , up to the period when the Presidential election of 1801 gave his character to history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide , we presume its correctness will hardly be impugned . The latter portion of his life has nothing to detain us . In 1804 , when he was hopelessly repudiated by the Republican party , and even stigmatized by the Federalists as a Cataline , there was enough left of a name and character once so influential , for a considerable number to ground a hope of founding a party of their own , under his auspices . He was accordingly run for Governor in opposition to Morgan Lewis , but want of success was foreseen from the commencement . It was during this contest that that second great event , for which he is darkly conspicuous in our annals , occurred , in the tragic death of Hamilton , which seemed to precipitate him upon his destiny-by foreclosing against him for ever the sympathy of the opposite party , who mourned their favorite as a martyr . This work throws no new light upon this transaction , and hurries over in like manner the last memorable event of Burr 's career , his too celebrated treason . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The verdict of the Court was " not guilty , " and there is nothing in the subsequent career of the acquitted criminal to make his country repent the lenity of his jury . The additional charges against Jefferson which Mr. Davis makes this trial the means of bringing forth-we have not now the space nor even the inclination to examine . They have been refuted again and again . We have now done with Mr. Davis ; - neither as illustration of history , nor of character , does his work possess the least merit . It has added nothing whatever of good to our former knowledge of Burr or his times , and even the great abundance of evil with which it is saturated , is nothing more , as we have shown , than a nifacciamento of the slanders of a wretched pamphlet war , which died away too // thoroughly after their first appearance to excite the least apprehension of permanence or effect , as respects the fame of Jefferson , from their present unhallowed revival . A few moments more to Burr 's character , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron Burr form , altogether , in his rise , his triumph , and his fall , one of the most impressive lessons in the history of a popular government . Under other circumstances and in a different state of society , his peculiar endowments and qualifications were such that he might probably have taken rank in history , among the herd of great men . ' Of brilliant talents ,  --   --  a mind , bold , clear , and sagacious ,  --  and an address singularly winning and attractive , he could have made himself conspicuous in any country or period , but was peculiarly fitted to distinguish himself in times when society , resolved into its original elements , left every character , without any adventitious obstacle or aid , to find its own level , and form its own support . Burr was thrown into relief strongly by the times in which he lived . His abilities and energy invested with a warmer interest than their own , the subordinate and somewhat insignificant services , in the war of Independence of a volatile and eager youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same qualities , aided by his position in society , gave him influence as a politician , when the people of this country were in the first noviciate of the labors and duties of self-government , and the pretensions of public men were examined with less scrutiny , and yielded to with more readiness , than when experience and necessity had taught them circumspection . As a politician , his strongest characteristic was his selfishnesshe had no steady or guiding principle , by which to regulate his conduct or opinions , and this instinct led him to adopt the course which promised the easiest attainment of his immediate object . This also made him reserved , and as a necessary consequence , the people became , in turn , distrustful . He had none of the eloquent candor , which makes purpose clear as action , and wins the confidence of friends , and the respect of adversaries , from the mere absence of all guile . By the inverse ratio Burr was , in an eminent degree , attractive in private life . He shone in the drawingroom ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , and honied words , could accomplish , what only lofty integrity and great actions could do in public life ,  --  win him the applause and distinction that he coveted . But even in his personal conduct , that want of principle , which was his bane as a politician , degraded him into a libertine and a voluptuary . The selfish gratification which was his object , found the price of pleasing in indulgences , for which honor , reputation , and morality , were sacrificed without a scruple . No man was ever socially more corrupt . " In his intercourse with females , " says his biographer , " he was an unprincipled flatterer , ever pre // pared to take advantage of their weakness , their credulity , or their confidence . She that confided in him was lost . In referring to this subject , no terms of condemnation would be too strong to apply to Colonel Burr . " Strong language , indeed , but which would be borne out by the personal testimony of all who knew him . The qualities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well calculated to give him success in his profession as a lawyer ; the reputation of lofty character , he could not win in any pursuit . There ,  --  - as the science of law has always , unfortunately for mankind , been practised ,  --  wiles , address , and assiduity , directed with sagacity and promptness , could hardly fail to effect their object . His practice , in consequence , became lucrative and extensive . He had , however , no weight as a lawyer , and the most remarkable instance of his success recorded by his biographer , was accomplished by a disreputable artifice , * which could never have been practised , still less exulted in , by an honorable mind . As a politician , he rose with great rapidity . There was a something in the mystery of his conduct calculated to impose upon , perhaps awe , minds less acute and active than his own . The art of management alone achieved for him the wonders of political weight and personal importance . He was invaluable in arranging the plan of a legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his party , became , in consequence immense . It was not of a kind , however , to extend beyond the sphere of his endeavours  --  and while his personal influence and popularity were , at one time , probably higher in his own State than that of any other man except Hamiltonunlike him , he was scarcely known throughout the Union . The nomination to the Vice Presidency was given to the State of New York , not won by Burr . The progress of that election furnished opportunities , calculated to bring every latent quality of Burr 's reckless and unprincipled character into action . He was by that contest placed in circumstances , where chance could bring within his grasp that dazzling prize , to which in other circumstances men could only look , as a reward of great services , or in the triumph of mighty principles  --  to be achieved by years of patient struggle , and to constitute a national success . There was nothing beyond that for an ambitious wish , and his specious philosophy too surely taught him that success would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The outrage against public principle was not less flagrant in the attempt , than it would have been in his success , and his political fate was sealed . The possibility of a public man colluding for an end , centering in himself with adversaries , against whom the whole party whose opinions he represented , were committed in direct hostility of cardinal views ,  --  is a political crime for which there is , and // ought to be , no forgiveness . That hostile principle formed the life and soul of his political power , and represented the mighty mass of hopes and fears and opinions , which had placed him in the front-their creature , their assertor , their conservator  --  and the very semblance of betrayal , in a crisis where unfailing confidence was at once the test of purity and the instrument of success-was a treason against all honor and all righteousness-infamous in its accomplishment , and fatally so in its failure . That charge was made against Burr . He had , before the whole A- country , been used as the instrument of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the withering accusation was added-with his own connivance . In the absence of direct proof against him there was nothing in his character , or previous political history , to repel the dark suspicions that were directed against him ; he showed no respect for the morbid anxiety of public honor which called for explanation . Morose , haughty and reserved , he received every charge with a sullen desperation that savored of the contumacy of guilt , until suspicion became confirmed , by a mass of conclusive circumstantial evidence ; and the towering fabric of his power , which , like a mighty oak of the forest , spread his influence far and wide , was uprooted , prostrated and withered , by the storm of indignant exasperation he had aroused . Utterly hopeless was that fall-most solemn and impressive is the lesson , to all public men , which it inculcates . It is in vain to talk of the ingratitude of republics , or of proscription , in the case of Burr . In no country , where freedom of opinion exists , will a public man be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that in proportion to the vigor and malignity of attack , will the counteracting love , confidence and respect of the people be diffused . Compare , for instance , the attacks of the press on Burr , with those on Jefferson-indeed it is unnecessary-for in malignity , extent , and vigor there is no comparison ,  --  yet , in spite of them , the influence of Jefferson grew in the country until he overshadowed the power *nd the hostility of a mighty and triumphant faction-in spite of them he carried his mild and salutary policy into effect  --  and in spite of them has his memory grown dear to his country , and his glory become identified with its institutions , and with the best interests of mankind wherever they are understood . Burr fell not before them , but because he had forfeited , for ever , all claims to public confidence or respect . The subsequent career of Burr developed more fully the darkness of those elements of his character which hurled him from his high estate . The death of Hamilton opened every eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in his subsequent trial for treason against his country , the restless and dangerous intriguer was laid bare in every motive . Tbough acquitted on the technical // charge , a higher tribunal had passed an irreversible judgment on his conduct , and he wandered forth from that bar , like the primal murderer , with the mark of God upon his brow ,  --  an outcast and an alien among his kind . From this time , it is impossible to reflect upon his fate without a feeling of fear and awe . A wanderer in foreign lands ,  - -  and every where suspected and repelled-  --  the proud man tasted the wretchedness of misery and want , and returned to his country , because he could find no asylum for the sole of his foot in all the earth , though he had essayed to purchase it by forswearing the very land of his birth . There he lived to a long wretchedness of age , forsaken by friends , deserted by kindred , and shunned by all . He lived to see most of the contemporaries among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history , and-sad extremity of fate  --  to see posterity , also , confirm the deliberate opinion of a previous age upon himself , consoled only , in the depths of his degradation , by the selfish excesses of a faded voluptuary , so far beneath the cognizance of social morality , as to be reckless of its frown and hardened from its effects . Awful , indeed , must have been the reflections of that desolate old man , as he wandered forth , alone , unknowing and unknown , in the heart of the mighty city where multitudes had once hung upon his words , and applauding crowds pressed eager round his steps ,  --  shunned by all , or pointed out to the gaze of timid curiosity , like some spectral revivescence of political enormity . Burr 's place in the annals of his country , will be secured to him only by the maleficence of his star . Up to the close of his legislative career in 1799 , he had not risen above the rank of an ordinary politician , and during his public career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gratitude or even the consideratiop. of his country . His name is connected with none of the great public events or measures of his day , nor has he left a single writing behind him in a period when principles and policy were discussed with all the energy and vigor of great and inquiring minds , from which his contemporaries could ever gather an opinion on the great questions of law and policy , which agitated his day ,  --  but the presidential election , the death of Hamilton , and his trial for treason , are dark distinctions , which will ever attach to his name , and secure him a place in history , equally conspicuous as a warning and an example.
