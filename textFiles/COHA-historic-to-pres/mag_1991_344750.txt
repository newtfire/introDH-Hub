From this day forth , the mere mention of Anita Hill 's name will conjure an authentic moment , one of those flashes of reality that are seared in the collective consciousness . Brought immediately to mind by a name or place , such instances are rare . Typically , the conditions they connote have long plagued a minority . Then , as epiphanies normally experienced through visual images , they are apprehended by the majority . And then , when an expression of national outrage follows , the attendant demands for redress carry the day . <P> The sight of young black children entering a previously all-white Little Rock , Ark. , school as Army troops stood guard caused millions of Americans to instinctively understand the rightness and the promise of integration . " Bull " Connor 's Birmingham cops and dogs signaled the distance still to travel and helped spur the end to de jure segregation . The image of Richard Daley 's Chicago cops clubbing peaceful demonstrators in 1968 caused the Democratic Party to reform itself . To hear the words Kent State is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissembling that characterized the Vietnam War 's prosecution by two Presidents . More recently , the amateur video of Daryl Gates ' Los Angeles cops beating Rodney King sensitized the nation to police brutality . <P> And now Anita Hill 's testimony has awakened men to an issue too few appreciate , and to regulations too few follow . The workplace will never be the same . <P> Will our politics change as well ? <P> The answer is elusive . Will a yes vote for Clarence Thomas carry political risks comparable to a no vote on the gulf war  --  at least among the part of the electorate that judges Hill more credible than Thomas ? Will the gender gap that again shows women 5% less likely than men to support President Bush 's re- election grow ? Will Bush , who has already appointed a record number of women to federal posts , feel compelled to increase the number of female senior White House aides , who now number two of 14 ? Will more women become candidates for office , and will those already challenging males in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation be affected ? Bush has threatened to veto the parental-leave and civil rights bills on the verge of congressional passage . Will he follow through on those threats , and if he does , will Congress muster the votes required to override those vetoes ? <P> Will Congress finally get with the program and have its workplace governed by the laws that apply in the rest of the nation ? Congress has exempted itself from most antidiscrimination statutes . As the matter stands , a congressional staff member who charges sexual harassment can complain only to Congress 's ethics committees , which have been notoriously tone deaf to such complaints . ( In 1989 , for example , Representative Jim Bates , a California Democrat , admitted making lewd remarks and touching female members of his staff . The House ethics committee issued its mildest form of discipline , a letter of reproval . ) <P> Most important , is there any hope of moving away from the corruption that suffuses American politics , a climate of cynicism the Thomas nomination has illuminated from the moment of his selection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the process of considering Thomas ' fitness for the court has been a charade .
