, often captain of his team , linked attack with defense ; numberfour stood guard at the team 's back . No one of those roles fully consumed Fabian 's ability to strike and to score  --  and to do this unaided . Most players were content to outmaneuver their opponentsin reaching the ball , wrestling it from them , driving it in the direction of the goal posts . The confrontation of opposing teams , each attempting to score a higher number of goals , was the core of polo , but for Fabian the game was essentially a oneon-onecontest between two players fighting for possession of the ball during any moment of the game . From the outset of his career , his disregard of the other three players on his team  --  many of them standing in the foremost international ranks  --  antagonized and humiliated them .

In polo , a sport of solitary valor and collective assault , with the ball in motion through the air most of the time , Fabian 's retaliations against players had been called accidental , unfortunateconsequences of the loss of precision any player might encounter in the rush of the game . But in time , some players began to discern a disquieting equation between Fabian 's strokes and the men and ponies that were the targets of his shots . Somewhere , someone voiced a concern ; elsewhere , another seconded it . Unaware , Fabian was watched now by the referee , his shots monitored by members of his own team , as well as by his opponents . Penalties were imposed on the team that sheltered him , for the personal penalties he levied against certain riders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective soul of the game . Polo players often shift team allegiances . Those whom Fabian punished one day were on his team the next day . Many refused to play with him , and soon Fabian dropped relentlessly fromp31one team after another , slipped gradually into the notoriety of isolation , a maverick . For a while he was polo coach at one of the Ivy League colleges , but it was not long before some of the school 's older alumni , considerable polo players themselves at one time and now on the board of trustees at their alma mater , denounced his presence in their collegiate athletics , citing what they called his inability to play in concert with polo teams of Europe , England or the Americas . As a student , Fabian had thought that his distrust of team play was simply the fear of being trampled to death by a massed tonnage of horses and men , each player , no less than his pony , driven by momentum that , like the goal scored , did not spring from the solitary force of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive , but stemmed , rather , from a collective strategy in which an individual destiny mattered little . Later in life , he decided that the spirit of the collective and the team bore for him another implication less ominous but equally disturbing : collective responsibility diluted one 's faults , but it also diminished one 's achievements , took away from them stature and consequence . One could no longer distinguish what was due to oneself and what to one 's team ; the boundaries of success and failure , victory and defeat were blurred in a tangle of humility and pride . Even further , the collective mood was insidious : after an impressivescore , applause for the group left players heady with a sense of invincibility ; then a player , racing his pony too fast at a turn or jostling an opponent too impetuously , would find his mount suddenly losing its balance and falling , burying him under it , just at the moment he was most confident of his prowess . The loss of a player in a crippling accident often devastated the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving him prone to accident and easy panic . Fabian 's polo  --  polo as Fabian played it  --  was the ground of his being in the world , the only uniqueness at his command . Shunned by most teams , he resigned himself to traveling around the countryin search of work as a polo referee or as a player in one-on-one polo games with wealthy opponents . Since these engagements were infrequent , he explored almost desperately the avenues of other talents , but found none . At times he worked as a riding instructor or lecturer , but , as hep32acknowledged with chagrin , by many of the formal standards of horsemanship , he was not thought to be a faultless rider . Accordingto these standards , the goal of horseback riding was to achieve that utmost security of a good seat , the calves , thighs , knees , hands , voice deployed gently by the rider to communicate his will to the horse without submitting it to unwarranted checks or restraints or violating its natural instinct toward self-preservation , its harmony of balance and sudden reflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeoffs , of abrupt halts and sudden veers and pivots . It demanded a rapid displacementof the weight of a horse and its rider ; it called for the strategy of reins insistently pulling on a horse 's mouth and bearing on its neck , the ceaseless prod of the spurs and the nip of the whip , the smiting heat and clash of one horse evading collision , colliding , seeking collision with another . Years of playing polo , practicing for it , riding ponies bred and schooled exclusively for that game had evolved in Fabian habits contrary to the safety , decorum and propriety of dressage , a hunt or a jump . Practicing at a stable , arena or paddock , he would often exhibit a demeanor in his horsemanship that disturbed , sometimes even shocked , other instructors , whether beginning or advanced . Worse yet , the incorrigibilityof his mistakes , and their vehemence , frequently tended to unnerve even the most pliant and submissive mounts . To write about horses and horsemanship became , for Fabian , one way to make a living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verve of others who worked that territory . In twenty years , he had published only a meager handful of books , each of them including a few sections on polo . But polo was still an exotic sport , evoking in the popular imagination phantoms of Britain and India at the Victorian high noon of empire , gentry and militaryalike chasing the ball and one another across the trim and decorous turf of a country estate . And most riding instructors and people who had a special feeling for horses showed little interest in polo or sympathy with it , in angry dissent from what they took to be its violence against animal and rider alike . Friends advised him to enter the world of state and national horse shows , not in the role of judge , which he frequently accepted , hut as a competing entrant . They pointed out that the horse show had progressed from the local pleasure of the entry ofp33the family back-garden horse to the big business of keen internationalcompetition , the winning horses commanding staggering prizes , their value increasing with every championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prestige as a polo player , coupled with the distinction he now commanded as a writer on equestrian art , would compensate for his defects in horsemanship and would persuade some of the better-known stables and individual owners or breeders to hire him and exploit his minor celebrity to win attention for their horses at major shows and events . But competition of this order was foreign to Fabian . In oneon-onemeets , he fought another man for supremacy in the short span of their play , submitting to rules that both contestants obeyed , without an umpire , away from the fickleness of a public that might choose favorites . Horse shows rated men and animals according to an order of excellence and accomplishment that did not interest Fabian . The essence of competition , for him , lay not in the challenge offered by others but always in the challenge posed by oneself.  |p34Fabian  lay in wait for fall in Massachusetts or Vermont , sometimes along the shallows , pleasant dunes and stretchesof the coast , but mostly in the northern reaches of the East , where summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break with life . There the leaves defiantly clung to the trees , and the mantling shrubbery , misted by the mild noon of autumn , bristled at the frosting chill of night . Fabian 's thirst for this spectacle , for its prick and stir , the immolationof odor and hectic bloom that only autumn offered , would come as suddenly as any other , ignited by a whiff of bark or mealy oats , the supple aroma of leather or hide , the musk of roots trailing a wind along the highway . He took it as a longing for something apart from thought , different from memory , beyond them , something to which one could stake no claim of one 's own , a realm outside the deed of charter or possession . When , in that season , Fabian would find his road approaching some grand estate , a frontier of thickly wooded land dense about it , acre on virgin acre , lie would drive off the highway into a clearing nearby and park his ' anlIonic , the signs ri  --  ; nlsiinnit.F : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bov on the scent of play ,  |p35he  would saddle his ponies quickly and , in a white polo helmet and padded knee guards that protected him from branches and underbrush , he would cut into the wood , astride one horse , the other , also saddled , on a lead rein , the ponies snorting , jostling in the promise of the run , plunging through the wiry brambles , thrusting forward , great plows scything the earth , tearing the ligaments and arteries of the stubborn thistles , the prickly shrubs , leaves in their clustering . Picking his way through the thicket , he would wade through layers of leaves , stalks , roots and stumps heaped in profusion , their dry , crackling billows making a sea music , soughing , the tidal lap rising about his ears , muting even the drum of the horses ' hoofs . The woods folded before him in silence : pine and fir , oak and beech sentinels of his transit . Perched on shoots of burdock , humiliated by the brawl of color that framed them , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravan sailing along channels and freshets of hazel and hornbeam , blackberry and sumac . Like a skiff bringing up the rear , a solitary leaf , its fretted veins a lair for the sun , would scud in his wake , gliding through the dappled air . At a pond , its surfacebrackish , mantled with mottled leaves , random patches of turbid fluid between brownish clumps reflected the yellow leaves of an overhanging tree . Breaking into an open path , his chest thrust out as if to take the crest of the wind , Fabian would sink into the saddle , his knees and calves firm about the horse as he threw it into a canter ; then , rising in the saddle , his weight full in the heels , he would prod it into a gallop , his eyes taut as bowstrings , reaching ahead , his hands on the reins alerting the horse to every shape , every color , the animal swift in its leap over a branch bent across the path or a fallen log . The other horse galloped directly behind or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in another stretch , he would goad them again into a canter , then slow abruptly , huddling in the saddle , and pick his way through pits and claws of broken branches , pools of stagnant water . Roots and clusters of stones , cradled like nuts beneath the dead leaves , peeled out from under the horses ' assault , then shards of sundered rock , chlnlps of soil ; lie breasted the barricades of old dislodged tree trunks , their bark gone leprous , bald , dangling in strips ,  |p36naked  stumps like beggars guarding the dark corners of the wood . Sometimes Fabian would chance upon others : a troop of boys wandering from the usual ruts , playing at scout and pioneer ; a family encamped in a clearing , knapsacks and sleeping bags strewn about , children idling with heaps of cones or stalking the fleet , scattering life of the underbrush . Erupting from a brake in the woods , Fabian 's convoy could stir alarm and a flush of panic ; people would halt at a distance far enough to take flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider framed against the trees , helmeted in white , booted in long sheaths of black and brown rising from the crested gleam of spurs to the armor of his knee guards , a black gloved hand curved about the poised lance of his long whip . A child , even one six or eight years old , would often break into howls of fear . Boys would scamper in yelps of confusion at this sudden apparition from a realm of fantasy and early memory . A man and woman , paling , agape , would draw children close , uncertain of what they were looking at , puzzling out its incongruity , calculating how to make a truce . Fabian 's easy greeting would calm them . Stammering , they would explain that there were no stables where they came from , that horses were too expensive for people like them to have anything to do with ; they might even admit , embarrassed , a little hesitant , that not only their children but even they themselves had not seen a horse and rider so near to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sneaking glances at Fabian and his ponies from behind the secure wall of their parents . Typically , a girl would ask her father why the horses were so much bigger than they looked on television , or a boy would wonder if the man on the horse was going to shoot him and his family down . Fabian would declare that his ponies were as tame as kittens and ask the boy to touch the horse or to see what it was like to sit with him in the saddle for a moment ; the boy , silent , pondering , would almost always refuse . Fabian 's path would at times take him onto a narrow bridge , a concrete wedge suspended above the highway that knifed across the forest . Lingering at its brink , returned again to the hurtling clamor of men and the machines they had contrived , he would look down at cars streaking in whatever freedom the highwayp37allowed , each blur a rider buckled in his plastic-covered saddle , in command of his solitary mount , his energy and surge a fusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glass and steel . On impulse , Fabian might raise an arm in greeting ; as metal , rubber and flesh hurtled below him , he was aware of heads turned for an instant from the asphalt belt to a man on a horse , the bizarre sentry standing guard on the overpass . Eager again for the woods , lost to everything but his senses , Fabian would turn the horse on its haunches and trot back into the thicket , cutting through huge stalks of hornbeam , sumac and boxwood . Toward dusk , he would ride easily back to his VanHome , relishingthe promise of the meal he would soon prepare . From the refrigerator in his galley he would take a thick slab of beef , glisteningand marbled , its bone doubling its weight , a ribbon of fat hemming the piece like lace . Studding it with spikes of garlic , dusting it with pepper and salt and herbs , he would place it between layers of onion and leave it to marinate , the meat now a pungent sandwich of bathing scent , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canvas bag or a sack , he would gather scraps and strips of bark , the season 's maple and birch , chestnut , oak , sheaves of the narrow-leaved branches of spruce and fir and pine , then a variety of cones , the springy pliant ones , young and full , as well as the desiccated , withered husks . The sack swelled with great clumps of weeds and damp grass mingling with batches of common fern , ribbons of liverwort , some moss , a heap of quillworts , whatever plants and herbs he chanced upon in trampling the brush . Windless evenings were best for the rites of forest , food and solitude , and he would make a shelter for himself secured by the barrier of his VanHome , cloistered from the gusting invasion of the breeze . Scooping out a shallow hollow of earth for his fireplace , he would bolster it with shoals of stone , then bridge the stones with an old iron triple bar from a stable . He would first set a match to a layer of coarse bark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a branch or two of spruce or larch , but when the flames spread to swamp the wood , . he tamped them down with splashes of water he brought from hisp38galley , until the hollow was only a dull amber glow . He heaped the embers then with the verdant plunder he had gathered in the forest , shuffling the heap until smoke appeared . He would put the meat on the bars , suspended high enough above the smoking fire to escape searing by a stray raw flame erupting through the layers of leaves and moss , fern and pine . The smoke clotted , its tang more acrid , the meat starting to sweat , then recoiling and shriveling , the fat a trickling dribble prodding the fire to yet another volley of blue and orange flame . When Fabian turned it over the first time , the steak had already changed color ; soon it was time for more salt and pepper , the herbs anointing its gleaming surface , then more heat , a fresh slew of the greenery that would mute the flames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ; twilight dissolved into night . Fabian would settle down to his meal , the banked embers flickering out , the smoke a trailing funnel above him , his hands and clothes and the forest enclave liquid with the aroma of cooked flesh , the steak as docile and comforting in his mouth , without taint of char or scorch , as it had been in the mouth of the boy , a farmhand long ago , when he had had to smoke chunks of horseflesh for the farmer 's family , making certain that the cherished meat , hoarded for months , would be spared the open flame , the essence of its life preserved , its tender substance sheltered by the gentle smoke long after the heat was gone from it . The country 's major polo resorts at which Fabian could have played , whether those in the Midwest , where polo was a game of summer and early fall , or the lavish , sunny retreats of Florida 's Sunshine Belt , where it was a winter pastime , were closed to him for a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fields , stables and quarters only to those who , first , bought and maintained the extravagant villas and condominiumsthat fell within their purview , and second , could meet the rigid , exclusive social and financial conditions that governedadmission to the ruling country clubs . Even those qualifying for membership in the clubs , should theyp39or their guests actually wish to play polo , were required to furnish and maintain at least one string of five or six ponies , together with the grooms to tend them . On those rare occasions when friendshipor chance brought him into the recesses of one of these prodigal polo resorts , Fabian was not at all surprised to learn that the purchase and annual maintenance of a modest string of ponies and gear , and the expense of transporting them , could easily amount to a sum comparable to the salary of the head of a flourishing corporate enterprise . Denied access to the central circuits of the game , unable to meet on common ground those who would be open to playing with him , Fabian was forced into his nomadic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony did not escape him that , of all the sports in which he might have excelled , polo was the one in which only a millionaire several times over could still afford to indulge , and at that , so few of them did . The closing and decisive game of the Third International Eugene Stanhope Polo Tournament , played annually at StanhopeEstates , one of the country 's major polo and golf centers , near Chicago , for the Grail Industries Trophy and , not incidentally , a purse of a quarter-million dollars , was delayed by a downpour . In the stands and around the field , more than three thousand polo fans shuffled their umbrellas and raincoats , wonderingnoisily whether the South American Centauros and New Zealand 's Hybrids would be able to play on a marshy field . But the rain stopped as abruptly as it had begun . Near Fabian , a silver-haired woman in a tweed suit folded an umbrella that she had been holding over a young man . Fabian saw that the young man 's head , neck and torso were trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale , pure features , oddly serene within that cage  --  seemed familiar ; Fabian recognized him as an American polo player who a few months earlier had broken his neck in a game in the Midwest . At a sound coming over the loudspeakers , the young man twirled a knob at his hip ; the contraptionrotated him in the direction of a loge in the front row . There Commodore Ernest Tenet Stanhope , once an eminentp40polo player himself and now the family 's ninety-year-old patriarch , had risen to speak into the microphone . Wearing the customarywhite polo breeches and British helmet , he announced that , as honorary chairman of the tournament named in memory of his late son , Eugene , he had just been informed that his other and only surviving son , Patrick Stanhope , would regrettably not be able to attend ; his obligations as president and executive directorof Grail Industries , the Stanhope family enterprise and the nation 's largest electronics manufacturer , detained him . He had , however , generously made available the helicopters which would help to dry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . A roar went up from the stands , and then the patriarch passed the microphone to Lucretia Stanhope , his daughter-in-law , a stately widow of forty . Serene in her position as chief organizer , she apologized briefly for the delay . Having taken occasion to remind the spectators that , only two years before her husband , Eugene Stanhope , had been killed tragically in a freak accident while preparing for this very tournament , she paused , then closed by announcing that the Eugene Stanhope Stables , breeders and traders of some of the country 's finest horses , would be open after the game as a courtesy to visitors , free of charge . Barely had Lucretia Stanhope finished when four turbopowered Grail Industries helicopters , hovering in formation above the field , descended slowly , wafting through the air to a point a few feet above the ground , the powerful downdraft of their blades blasting the puddles out of the sodden turf , hastening evaporation . At the far end of the field the drivers and owners of perhaps seventy vintage cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out annually for the parade that always started the polo tournament  --  began gently to swab down the gleaming waxed surfaces of their machines . Television crews settled into their perches on the aluminum towers that had been erected for the match . Several photographers , burdened with camera gear , scurried about , quick to spot star players who had begun to emerge from tents around the field . Some were alreadv snapping the betterknownpolo ponies as their owners ' grooms started to saddle themp41up at hitching rails next to trailers and motor homes . Still other reporters prowled through the stands , on the lookout for personalitiesfrom the local and international jet and polo sets always drawn to the tournament . A motorcade of two dozen open convertibles sporting balloons , flowers and American flags began to circle the field . They carried officials of the various U.S. polo associations and officers of the corporations that supported the tournament and contributed to the purse . The antique cars inaugurated the parade , proceeding slowly in sequence , each braking carefully to avoid collision . They were followed by high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them floated a large flower bed nestled on a moving platform from which Miss Polo Cup , a vivacious brunette in a bikini and polo helmet , pelted the crowd with flowers . Bringing up the rear of the parade , four stunt riders encased in medieval armor , lent by one of the local museums , conducted a mock jousting tournament . Pivoting their mounts , they bore down on each other at full gallop , lances outthrust , horses straining beneath the unaccustomed weight of metal-clad riders , and with spectacular showmanship averted by inches the brutal jar of body and armor . A middle-aged man , his gaunt features marked only by a thin mustache , turned toward Fabian . The man was dressed in a faultlessly tailored safari jacket , white breeches and two-tone shoes , a brier burl pipe in his manicured hand . " I say , this is quite a show they 're putting on here , " he said with an exaggerated English accent . " These copters alone could take over my whole country , you know . " He laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rabble could be ? " He pointed his pipe with disdain at the stands . " Polo fans . Stable owners . Farmers . Breeders . College polo teams , plain folks like you and me . " The man twitched his shoulders . " Plain folks ? I flew first-class to this tournament . " " Where from ? " " From Brunei , my home , by way of London , of course . " " Brunei ? That 's exciting , " said Fabian , not certain he had ever heard of the place before . " Exciting ? Not really . " The man puffed another c  --  1otid ofp42smoke . " Our only natural resources are squash and badminton  --  and the breeze of the China Sea . " " Squash , badminton and the breeze ? " " Well , yes . And , I 'll be damned , polo , of course . " " And polo ? " " Polo . Recently introduced by our gracious government . " " By your government ? " " Yes . By His Highness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Brunei Regiment , as well as by the police force and our air wing , of course . " " But of course , " said Fabian . Sweeping slowly back and forth , the helicopters completed their task . To a storm of cheering from the stands , they gradually rose , hovered for a moment , and then wheeled out of sight . The field was suddenly quiet . It was still a bit soggy and steaming in the sun , but the shiny pools of water had all gone . Fabian divided the world of sport into games played with a ball and games played without one . Among those in which the ball was pivotal , polo was , for him , matchless . In the mesh of two opposing teams , each composed of four players , he saw the equation of man and horse , the duel of man with man , as defining poles on a field of tension . The space was compact , encompassing both the solitary drama of the player , isolated in the display of his own singularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of group combat exhibited in the contradictions and fusions of the team 's collective will . " Pony quick and polo stick , " Fabian would often muse , distillingthe essence of polo , the game of six or eight chukkers , each chukker a maximum of seven and a half minutes long . Its constantswere the pony  --  four to six horses , usually Thoroughbreds , all balanced and short-strided , expertly schooled in polo , needed by each player in the course of a game  --  and the mallet , a sixteenouncestick more than four feet long , its shaft a bamboo shoot , a rubber-bound handle at one end , and at the other end a nineinch-longcigar- or cylinder-shaped head of solid bamboo , maple or mulberry , its hitting surface less than two inches wide , its toe tapered , its heel squared off.  |p43The  polo pony had to be steadily trained for two or three years to become speedy in takeoff , fleet in running , agile in turning and pivoting , quick to stop dead and just as quick to take off again from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green about the size of nine football fields , a polo player might drive the ball with a ferocious blow of his mallet across hundreds of feet . In that flight toward the goal posts , twenty-four feet apart and ten feet high , the ball  --  a wooden globe three and a quarter inches in diameter and not more than four and a half ounces in weight  --  often speeding at a hundred miles an hour , could gather momentum sufficient to shatter a horse 's bone , smash pony or rider into insensibility or even death . The armored medieval knights , still jousting in mock combat , finally moved off the turf . The two field umpires scuffed and prodded the ground , testing it before they waved their arms to the referee , in the grandstand , to signal that the field was dry enough for the game to begin . Fabian took in the babble of fans rustling about him , odds , stakes , small-time betting . The Hybrids , the New Zealand team , seemed to be a favorite . Each of their players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; many in the crowd were convinced that the Hybrids ' mounts were among the best in the world , so valuable that , unlike the Centauros , the Hybrids bore the expenseof taking their ponies home with them after the tournament . The polo fans felt that such prized ponies guaranteed supremacy . They liked the New Zealanders ' link to an Anglo-Saxon legacy of respecting the horse , a heritage which , while refining and perfecting the caliber of horsemanship , invariably brought out the best in the mount . Fabian , on the contrary , threw in his lot with the South AmericanCentauros . He knew the common objection to them  --  that since they sold their ponies at auction after the tournament , they must have left their best breeds at home  --  but he knew , too , that their team claimed two of the six foremost international polo players , each assigned a tots rating of ten points , and two more rated at eight . Moreover , they were players well into the second and third generation , bred in a clin-ate where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . Just as a mechanic here took pleasure in tuning up , revvingup or tinkering with a car left in his trust , a skilled South American groom took a comparable freedom in schooling a polo pony to his will . Since South American players never staked winning on one horse , changing ponies several times during a game , and kept equally skilled mounts in reserve , to them traininga pony meant , above all , making it a fast runner . To prolong endurance and accelerate pace , they might inject the horse with stimulants rousing it to a pitch of heady charge . They knew how to liquefy its blood to speed circulation and how to numb its legs to pain and fatigue by local anesthetic or by a procedure called nerving , which deadened feeling in the animal 's legs . From opposite ends of the field , the Hybrids and the Centaurosnow entered the arena , proceeding toward a point before the grandstand . The players wore cotton T-shirts in their team colors , sleek-fitting white breeches and high leather boots capped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer plastic helmets enclosed their heads ; their eyes and faces were shielded by narrow guards . Their ponies were trussed with cheekpieces , throatlatches , bands across the nose and brow ; they were harnessed with lip straps , snaffles that gagged , curb bits and chains , breastplates , stirrup irons with broad footplates . Tightly coiled bandages blazing with team colors cushioned their legs against the mallets , the ball , the flying hoofs of other horses . Marshaled in formation , mallets held upright like flags on parade , players on mounts reined tautly , they suggested fleetingly a movingfrieze of man and horse approaching ceremonial combat . An antique biplane , trailing the banner of Grail Industries , circled the field , startling the mounted horses ; when it flew away , one of the umpires tossed the ball into their midst . The game began . In an explosive melee , players and ponies took off at full pace , mallets threshing the air , clumps of the still-damp turf flying at the impact of hoofs scrambling , braking to a dead stop , pivoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eachp45team revealed itself . The Hybrids adhered to their familiar strategy of playing the man rather than the ball . The pony 's secure and easy grace was foremost in each player 's style . He held the reins , either single or double , in the English fashion , one finger between each curb and snaffle , the hand clenched in a fist around the whip , knuckles up . Even at the game 's hottest pitch , he spurred his pony more by the pressure of knees and calves than by punishing it with a whip , bridling the mouth only in short spurts , his mount balanced , its leading foreleg always on the side of the turn . In taking out after the ball , the player rose , balancing with his knees , shoulders tilting over the pony 's ears , his suppleness in the hips and waist a visual pleasure . As he jockeyed the reins with his left hand , his use of the mallet with the right was invariablycorrect : its handle in the palm of his hand , between thumb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehand always to the front of the pony 's forelegs , a backhand near its hind legs . Mounted on fast and bold , superbly trained Argentinean Thoroughbreds , the Centauros were celebrated for their speed and audacity . With a peculiar vehemence of temperament , each player kept his pony under relentless check  --  the snaffle reins bunched together between the thumb and first finger , the curb reins between the first and second fingers , the whip held by the thumb against the palm , the knuckles of the fist sideways  --  the bit and spur steady pressures in a sequence of changing pace , fierce stops and deft turns . His eyes on his opponents , on the line of attack and on the ball , each Centauro , an image of perfection , drove and whipped his pony , flanks already bloodied , into a frenzied gallop . The Centauro was unique in his habit of momentarily transferring the reins to his right hand , next to the mallet handle , thus freeing his left hand to use the whip with full force . His grip on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs , arm and shoulder in harmonious alignment with the mallet as it struck  --  he scooped the ball smoothly off the ground , propelling it in an arc into the air . Fabian remembered an incident in a game that called up echoes of a memory beyond time . A South American player had violently accelerated his mount ; it responded by raising its fore/leg in a propulsive drive well ahead of its forward weight just as its rear leg hit the ground . By instinct , the pony stretched out in a buoyant spring , its ears sleekly flattened to counter the drag of wind . In a single frozen shaft of movement and force , millennia fell away , and Fabian saw the streaming flight of a horse from its flesh-tearing foes . The speed pounded . Suddenly , turning to strike the ball , the player pulled brutally on the reins , gagging the pony . The animal abruptly lost momentum , its natural rhythm snapping with the retracted foreleg . As the rider spurred his mount to push off , its foreleg crashed on the turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pony , foaming in its frenzy , kept at the gallop , its splintered leg buckling , a bare bone protruding at every footfall , until , staggering , the animal pitched and stumbled . Only then did the rider , as frenzied and possessed as his mount , become aware of what had taken place . The gala to celebrate the tournament , sponsored by the residentsof Stanhope Estates , was given at the Polo and Golf Club for members of the competing teams , other polo players and visitinginternational personalities in sport and society . Fabian arrivedwithout an invitation and wandered uneasily among the formally dressed crowd . In one of the rooms , he heard his name . A middle-aged man in a blue suit was heading for him , his silver tie pierced by a stickpin in the shape of a polo ball of pearl being struck by a gold mallet . The man 's eyes settled on Fabian with a bird 's rapacity . " I know who you are , " he announced , closing in with an air of mock conspiracy . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , the famous Fabian , " the man exclaimed , draggingFabian by his upper arm to a corner . " Michael Stockey , " he introduced himself . " I kept looking for you among the polo mercenarieshere , " he said , " but I was told you had n't sold to anyone . True ? " " I had n't sold because there were n't any buyers , " said Fabian . Stockey edged closer . " Come to think of it , " he said in a cheer/ful voice , " you and I met once before . At the polo tournament at Los Lemures , in the Caribbean . " Fabian apologized for failing to remember their meeting . Stockey was undeterred . " In any case , your name came up recently , " said Stockey . " At Grail Industries , we feel that polo is the game of the future  --  the fastest and most dangerous sport in the world . Half a ton of man and horse smashing into seven other horses and players on a thirty-five-mile-an-hour collision course  --  and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limb for his competitive edge ! What a blitz of a game that is ! " He began to warm to his vision . " Polo , the supersport : the hazards of steeplechase , the speed of racing , the violence of ice hockey , the tension of football , the precision of baseball , the challenge of golf , the teamwork of roller derby . Polo  --  the ultimate action sport . " He paused , pleased with himself , then continued . " The game of kings is still the king of games . If boxing , baseball and hockey made it to TV , so will polo . Grail Industries wants to underwrite international tournaments in various polo resorts and put them on nationwide television . When you have ponies famous for their prices and players famous for their looks and their high point ratings , not to mention all those celebrities brushing elbows at the various tournaments , polo will be a real winner . What do you say , Fabian ? " " It 's like no other sport , " Fabian said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then that 's where you fit in , Fabian : a host for our series . Who could be better ? You wrote books about polo . You helped write the amendments to the Horse Protection Act . You 've lived half your life abroad , played polo all over the world . You personally know some of the best polo players . " He stopped , anxious for Fabian 's reaction . " Whose idea was I ? " Fabian asked guardedly . " Patrick Stanhope himself asked me to track you down and sound you out about it . He 's very grateful for all the attention you gave their little Vanessa , teaching her to ride and jump so well ; she 's never had a fall . Of course , not everyone was on your side . " Stookey paused . " Some polo association people  --  well , pri/vately , they say that no team will have you . That you 're the ball hawk who plays solitary , that you seldom miss a goal  --  and never another player . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a story . " Stockey coughed nervously , then went on . " They say you learned those trick shots as a kid , during the War in Europe , when you were forced to work on a horse in some peasant bullring , that you belong in a circus , not on a polo field . They do n't even want you as an umpire or a referee . " " I know . " " And I suppose you also know that some people say that what happened  --  well , that Eugene 's accident was no accident  --  that the two of you were fighting a kind of duel . " As Fabian maintained his silence , Stockey folded his hands into a steeple , wagging them pensively . " Mind you , though , a duel  --  even when there 's a death  --  well , the law does n't call it murder . " His voice was trailing off slyly . " You know what I mean . Fabian gave no sign . Stockey released his clasp , throwing his hands wide with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there that morning said you both played fast and rough , but that Eugene rode straight into the ball that smashed his face . What 's more , you rode with a hand badly hurt the day before ! " " I cut off my finger , " Fabian corrected him . Stockey twitched anxiously . His teeth crept into view as he forced another smile . " Mind you , Patrick Stanhope knows his brother 's death was a plain accident . Is there any serious player who was never injured at polo ? " " I was never injured at polo , " said Fabian . " Good for you ! " Stockey exclaimed . " Although most experts are supposed to have gone through many accidents . " " If you have many accidents , you 're not an expert , " Fabian said . " That 's a pretty extreme view , " Stockey said cautiously . " You sound like your books , Fabian . People like to think they 're pros even when they fail . " His voice dropped . " Your books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport , not books about accidents , " Fabian said.  |p49Stockey  gave him a long reflective look . " But come to think of it , your books make you a spokesman for polo safety  --  and even a better prospect for our TV show . What d' you say , Fabian ? " " I 'll have to think about it , " Fabian said . Stockey clapped him on the shoulder . " We can help to set you up in Florida  --  say , in the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club  --  and think what fun you 're going to have then ! The best players from all over the world , great crowd , all the celebrities you can handle ! " He handed Fabian an engraved card . " Call me sometime soon and say yes , will you ? " He walked away , toward the bar . At the center of the room , a group of women in rippling flowered dresses spooned mounds of ice cream into long-stemmed silver bowls from a raspberry-and-vanilla polo player on a chocolate-mochapony : a mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon had come back for its revenge , trickling along the glass walls of the club room , one flash of lightning pursuing another . Unwilling to be recognized again after the conversation with Stockey , Fabian sat down at an empty table in the room 's dimmestcorner . Two waiters rearranged chairs and changed the cloth . A woman approached his table , the sheath of her gown yieldingto every movement of her body . He recognized Alexandra Stahlberg . " How are you , Fabian ? " she asked with a faint smile . Her large oval eyes took on a mischievous glint as she smiled , her slightly parted lips revealing the milky perfection of her teeth . Fabian rose . She extended her hand and he took it  --  smooth and narrow , firm , cool . Memory summoned at once the pressure of her hands on him , the recollection of fingers probing , opening the way for lips and tongue . He glanced at her hands . She caught his look . " Are you still fascinated by a ring finger , Fabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her escort . " I am  --  by you , " Fabian said , as he pondered this second entryof Alexandra Stahlberg into his life.  |p50In  the time since Eugene 's death , Fabian had seen Alexandra many times , but only in advertisements  --  tempting him in an airportwaiting room , enticing him from the ranks of glossy magazinecovers arrayed under the harsh lights of an all-night newsstand . Once , standing in line at a public telephone , he glanced up to find himself the target of her seduction . She loomed , demanding , on a billboard that announced some new lip gloss , her chin resting on those intricately twining fingers , one of them erect , brushing the provocation of her lips , as if to signal , to silence , to alert , her eyes locked in a duel with those who gazed up at her . Fabian and Eugene Stanhope had been friends . Eugene often hired Fabian as his partner in polo practice or matches , and they traveled in Eugene 's private plane to various clubs and tournamentsaround the country and abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maharaja Jabar Singh , the legendary Indian polo player , at La Romana , the resort in the Dominican Republic . On one flight to La Romana , Eugene introducedAlexandra , a young fashion model , to Fabian . She was an old friend , Eugene said easily , not troubling to conceal what Fabian could recognize at once  --  that Eugene and Alexandrawere lovers . Later during the trip , to dispel gossip and to distract the vigilant eye of his wife , Lucretia , he asked Fabian to pretend that Alexandra was Fabian 's girl . Fabian agreed . From then on , he was frequently Eugene 's guest at Stanhope Estates ; Alexandra would usually show up a day or two after his arrival for her trysts with Eugene . About a year after Fabian met Alexandra , Eugene again hired him as a practice partner before a tournament and invited him to stay at Stanhope Estates . A few weeks before he was to see Eugene , Fabian ran into Alexandra . She was with a French film producer ; although only a casual polo acquaintance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lively pleasure that Fabian and Alexandra , whom he apparently had known for a long time , also knew each other . Alexandra maintained a sullen silence , but the Frenchman revealed freely that he and Alexandra often traveled together , and that , with an eye to her obvious allure , he was planning to build one of his sexually explicit films around her . When with ap51kiss he sent her off to go shopping , Fabian , who had been attracted to Alexandra from the moment of Eugene 's introduction , caught her anxious stare . Alone with Fabian , the producer boasted with elaborate detail and relish about his affair with Alexandra . What he said fueled Fabian 's fantasy , replacing old images with new , spurring his initial attraction . Fabian felt he should make a determined effort to know Alexandra . He arrived at Stanhope Estates eager to reassure her that she could trust his discretion ; he would not betray to either man the critical presence of another in her life . Eugene had been called away on a short business trip , leaving orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put at the disposal of Alexandra and Fabian . Alexandra took an upstairs bedroom ; Fabian moved into a room on the ground floor . He released his ponies to be groomed and exercised at the StanhopeStables , then parked his VanHome near the house . After dinner at the Polo and Golf Club with several players and their wives , Alexandra suggested that she and Fabian walk across the deer park sloping gently between the club and their house . Overhead , wind ruffled the treetops , but on the sandy path , where moonlight hung like smoke , the quiet was broken only by a steady whir of grasshoppers beckoning them from the ground . Aware that for the first time he was alone with Alexandra , Fabian'sthought flowed in strands , shifting with the slightest pulse of the uncertain moment . Alexandra broke the stillness . " I have always supported myself . " She spoke , as if to herself , in a cool , detached voice . " And as long as I am not abused by the men I live with , I choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reassure her . " I wo n't tell  --  " " I know you wo n't , " she broke in , " although even if one day you do , neither of them would mind . They know what they want . " " What do they want ? " Fabian asked . The forest was dry , the air sultry , the clatter of grasshoppers incessant . A lightning bolt , swift and thunderless , carved the sky . As Fithian strained his eyes to fill in the contours of the night ,  |p52another  flash of lightning revealed Alexandra , standing near him . " I promise better than any woman in the world , " she said , " and they want to follow through on what I promise . " They were close to their house now , about to pass his VanHome . As if she were leaving a mark in ghostly dust , Alexandra drew one finger across its surface . " Can I see the inside ? " she asked . Fabian looked at the mesh of shadows on her face and bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked , confessing the impotence of reason . " It could . But should you ? " He entered the cab of the VanHome and turned on the lights in the lounge . She stepped in behind him . " So this is where you hide out ? " She looked around the lounge , then peeked up at the alcove . " This is where I live and work , " Fabian said . Alexandra asked for red wine . Relieved to be able to conceal his anxiety , Fabian went to the wine rack , where he pulled out the last bottle and uncorked it , pouring her a glass . She sipped the wine slowly . Her eyes rested briefly on a boxed collection of Fabian 's polo books , but she did not reach out to touch them . She was amused by the writing chair he had made by setting a polo saddle on a wooden tripod . Lifting the hem of her evening dress , she slid astride the saddle ; the movement pushed her dress up , above her thighs . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sheen of light , rippled in waves over her neck and shoulders . In her shimmering dress , straddling the chair , the head of the saddle between her exposed thighs , her feet nude in their high-heeled sandals , leather straps binding her ankles , she tantalized . With the knowingness that made her so proficient a model , Alexandra splayed her fingers over her ankles , coiling and unravelingher hands , showing the red stain of her nails , molded for exhibition , then interlocking her fingertips with her enamelglazedtoes . Fabian watched the complicity of hands and feet , fingers and toes : all elongated , tensile , nervous , they seemed at moments like the fragile plaster features on a religious figurine , in perpetual danger of snapping off.  |p53She  raked her fingers through her hair , cosseting it as if gatheringthe silence of the room , then glanced into a mirror on the wall : twins , one arrested in glass , one flesh , each chary of the other . The woman in the mirror caught his stare ; he could no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alexandrasmiled . " At work , they call me the centipede , " she said . " Centipede ? " " Yes . Legs , feet and hands . " She shifted to one side of the saddle , her hands on her lap , her legs drifting apart , the dress snaking even higher . She knew he could see the insides of her thighs . " What are you thinking , Fabian ? " " I wonder who inhabits such a perfect being . " " Take a look , then . " Alexandra slipped off the saddle , her dress slithering down her legs . She walked to the bar and picked up the bottle of wine Fabian had opened for her . Bottle in one hand , glass in the other , she leaned against a wall and looked at him . She was waiting . Fabian felt himself at a crossroads , forced by the will of another to unsettle the harmony he had achieved between his codes and inclinations . He liked Eugene and was comfortable in his company . Even when Fabian was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sturdy health , good looks and fortune . Possibly because Eugene recognized that Fabian was living his life precisely as he wanted , Eugene returned that steadiness by never belittling his own money , power and position , or by pretending that he chafed at the confinements of being rich . His wealth was like a toy he had chosen to share with Fabian ; they would play with it toher . It was Eugene 's co-signing of the loan that had permitted Fabian to acquire the VanHome ; then a cash gift from Eugene HI Fabian 's birthday had helped to pay for Big Lick and Gaited 1ndblc . Now , by asking that Fabian be on call for him to hire , Eugene had become the chief source of Fabian 's income . Eugene was aware of the complex tangle of friendship and debt and , as it to put Fabian on a more independent footing , had mentioned the possibility of underwriting a series of manuals on horsemanship , with Fabian as the editor.  |p54Fabian  felt Alexandra 's gaze steady on him . She was still waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another facet of his measureless wealth , but was that sufficient to impose a check on Fabian , to bridle his desire for her ? Did her affair with the French film producer not intimate her availability , a sexual field on which many could sport ? Finally , did Alexandra herself , intent on ensuring Fabian 's connivance , now choose to invest her body in that silence ? To decline Alexandra 's challenge , to thwart his instinct toward her , would , ratify an indolence or lapse in value . Either would subvert his trust in himself . Without looking at Alexandra , the balance of his mind restored , Fabian abruptly turned off the overheadlight in the lounge . A single blue bulb lighted the narrow staircase to the sleeping alcove . For reasons of mental economy , Fabian chose to think of certainpeople as polarized , their unity sundered into compatible or antagonistic hemispheres . There were the symmetries and the asymmetries . In the symmetric , the halves , the face , the body and the soul were harmonious ; the symmetric rested in calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremities of life . In the asymmetric , the halves were at variance , constrained by no uniformity ; undulant , the asymmetric gave way to spasmodic eruptions of play . Character defined the symmetric , personality the asymmetric . The symmetric was driven , the asymmetric enacted . To a casual eye , the symmetric was comely , the asymmetricinteresting . Alexandra had seemed to Fabian a classical symmetric ; during their night together , however , in lovemaking that was unrestrained , even obsessive , she divulged that chasm between her external poise and her inward turbulence . Fabian responded with fascination . In this freedom to make love to her , in his awareness of that gift of herself as an incarnation of his need , he scanned the waxingof his own excitement , revealed himself naked before her , to signal to her that there was nothing in him that was not hers . She accelerated the mounting spiral of his pleasure with a deliberaterhythm.  |p55In  the haze of morning , he watched her sleeping . He had scheduled stick-and-ball practice for early that day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing and doubt streaked through him , intermittent , unruly , leaving him numb and uncertain . At lunch , he was told that Eugene , who had not been expected back for two or three days , had returned and wished to see him in the old house . He went directly to the drawing room . Eugene and Alexandra were waiting for him . Eugene , formal in a gray business suit and white shirt , sat in a heavy leather armchair guarded by the sweep of an ornate hunt table . Alexandra was perched on the thick arm of his chair , one of her legs swaying slightly . Her breasts showed through the sheer halter of her jumpsuit . Fabian started to hold out his hand , but something in Eugene 's expression arrested him midway . He looked at Alexandra , and she turned her head . He pulled a chair up to the hunt table and sat down . Eugene scrutinized him . " I thought you were my friend , " he said , measuring the words . " I am your friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and brought her closer . She let her weight rest on him . Both of them looked at Fabian as if he were a schoolboy called to account . " Alexandra tells me that , last night , under the pretext of showingher your trailer , you tried to force her to make love to you , " Eugene said . Fabian felt out of his element , alien and solitary . " Alexandra is lying , " he said . His eyes turned to Alexandra . She sat calm and indifferent , regarding him with an expression that remained long after the emotion that formed it seemed to have dissolved . " Alexandra admitted that the wine you forced on her made her a bit drunk . " Eugene paused . He looked up at Alexandra , and she nodded as if to prompt him in what he was about to say . He turned back to Fabian . " She also told me , " he went on in a harsh voice , " that , even though she remained fully dressed , she spent a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she felt safe enough to run out on you . " Ile paused again . Alexandra pressed his shoulder and , as if ashamed of herself , lowered her head.  | " I know everything there is to know , Fabian , and I know it from Alexandra , " Eugene said . " Alexandra and I have no secrets from each other  --  that 's the secret of our love . Did you think you could destroy that with one bottle of wine ? " Fabian looked at Alexandra , a soft glow on her cheeks , her lips parted . She wore a look of an obedient daughter submitting to the wisdom of Eugene , her all-knowing father . Fabian 's memory had not yet edited out her presence when she lay next to him . As he watched her now , the memory of what had happened between them brought her words back to him : " I 've been stuck , Fabian . Stuck waiting on men and what they want , always what they want , their weary flesh in search of an easy hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraces , and moaning and humping  --  that constant in-and-out missionary commuting . They leak into me , then off to sleep they go , and then on to the office . " He had glided closer to her , one hand under her waist , rising , the other lingering on her neck , her shoulders , hesitant to descendonto her breasts , to know again the sensation of their firmness , their sculpted shapes . He kissed her on the mouth , and it came back to him , pressing , a response vigilant and insistent . She watched him , commanding his gaze , not allowing him to lose or deny the expression in his eyes , or for a moment , even in thought , to withdraw to another world , one that might be entirely his own  --  or one that he might share , in recollection or fantasy , with another woman . He thought of her legs upon his chest , her calves girdled round his ribs . Her skin lapped him with a smoothness that Fabian imagined to gleam in the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her soles supple against his cheeks . He was conscious of the high arch of her instep , the roundness of the heel grazing his jaw , her toes , lithe and fragile , prodding his lips , splitting the furrow of his mouth , prying open the clenched gate of his teeth , plying his tongue . Her hand deep within him , her foot mastering his mouth , he labored as if to summon life , but each time she brought him to the brink of orgasm , her hand refused to allow him to yield to it : consenting to submit to passion , he was denied the thrust of the gift.  |p57Now  he stared across the hunt table at her hands , their slender , carved fingers linked in her lap . He thought of those hands , in the night : how they had summoned the muscles of his body to their collusion , kneading him at will , exploring him with boldness , the cool enamel of her nails tracing the taut membranes of his depth , ignoring his resistance , unlocking him to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her eagerness to have him open to her , her refusal to permit him to retain some region of his body as inviolate , the license she extended to her mouth and tongue to venture where her hand and fingers had gone before , there was an unmasked avidity of possession . But he also sensed her conviction that what she was doing , although offered to him as pleasure , was exacted as proof that  --  in whatever manner she invoked  --  he would be hers . She was able , finally , to abolish his last thin awareness of her will . He no longer cared what impulses she submitted to in her commitment to his need : whether they were stages in a drama , ordered by her and enacted by him , that would permit the revelationof his own nature , his pleasure at the discovery a tribute to her zeal ; or whether , provoked by her , he was the one who would disclose what lay hidden in her , what she could not otherwiserelease , the pleasure she sought most . The pensiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've always been turned on by a man 's rear , Fabian . Always . Doing it to a man 's rear , with my fingers , my hand , my mouth , my tongue , that 's the only sex that sends me up . But Eugene hates it . One time he got really upset . He screamed at me that it was a sick and savage thing ; no other woman had ever done such a sick and savage thing , trying to make a fag out of him . " As she spoke , Fabian reflected that her lawlessness in seizing her pleasure , bending him to her will , that very lack of constraint might have arisen from a vanity and terror at abandoning herself to the play of sex , to the risk that she might , in the presence of her lover , lose the carriage and control that her profession imposed . Knowing that , with his orgasm , her power over her lover waned , she would violate any taboo to prolong his craving , break any bond , penetrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward across the - p58table , his finger pointing at Fabian , his voice thick with menace . " Alexandra says you tried to force her to do a sick and savage thing , but she pushed you away and ran out . " " Alexandra is lying , " Fabian said . " You 're the one who 's lying ! " Eugene shouted . " You 're the liar . " In their time together , Fabian had seen Eugene defeated , his pride wounded . He had seen him in physical pain , seen him knocked unconscious . He had witnessed his control and easy bearing among simple horse breeders or trainers who had no idea of his position , had observed his tactful restraint among foreign polo players , some of them abusive , to whom the Stanhopename meant nothing . He had felt Eugene 's commanding presence in his offices , the fount of his corporate power . Yet nothinghe thought he knew of his friend could have prepared Fabian for the flood of rage that now confronted him . Under that abuse , face to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor judge of character he had been . " Alexandra is lying , " he said . " Last night I took her straight home . " In the telling , Fabian regretted his own lie . Desperate only in his attempt to thwart Alexandra 's assault on the bond between him and Eugene , his mind denied her entry to his VanHome . The words betrayed his despair , and he realized it was futile to retract his lie . " You 're a liar , " Eugene said . " The minute she saw you , Alexandrawarned me to stay away from you . She said you would n't lift a finger for me . Now I know how right she was . Get out of here ! " His face still contorted , he leaned back in the chair , pullingAlexandra toward him again . Fabian 's rage was now as uncurbed as Eugene 's . Reaching across the table swiftly with his right hand , he seized an Indian dagger that lay anchoring some papers . At the same moment , he smashed the table with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one urgent arc , he brought the dagger down and sliced off the tip of his ring finger . Blood spurting from the stump , the severed piece skidded across the surface . As Alexandra recoiled , turning away from the table , Fabian picked up the fingertip and thrust it at Eugene.  | " Here it is , " he said , dropping it and the dagger in front of him . " Alexandra was wrong : I have lifted it for you . " Eugene shoved the bloody tip back across the table with the dagger . " You 're still a liar , Fabian ! " he shouted . " Alexandra told me that , to make her drunk , you gave her your strongest wine . She told me she almost finished off the bottle . This morning , after you left for stick-and-ball practice , I went to that stagecoach of yours and , just as she said , I found the bottle where Alexandra said it was . " He caught his breath only to shout louder . " I ought to teach you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all standing now . The fingertip lay on the table between them , and for a moment Fabian had a wild urge to leave it there . Choking back his dread , his fury an anesthetic against pain , he reached out and picked the fingertip up , held it reluctantly between his thumb and forefinger . He almost expected it to respondto his touch , but the gobbet of flesh felt like bloodied rubber , the nail plastic . He quickly joined the fingertip to the throbbing stump and , grasping both firmly in his right hand , turned to go . Blood dribbled down his trousers and across the floor . " You hired me to play polo with you , " he said to Eugene . " Play it tomorrow , six in the morning , and teach me to stick-and-ball any way you can . Training field . No witnesses . " " I 'll be there ! " Eugene was still shouting as Fabian left . Back in his room , Fabian poured antiseptic over the mutilated finger , attempting to seal the amputated tip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazed him in the car as a stable boy drove him at full speed to the hospital . In the emergencyroom , a surgeon stitched together the parts of the severed finger and , wrapping a bandage around the wound , reassured Fabian that there was a good chance the coupling would take and that in time the finger would be restored to use . Fabian returned to his VanHome and lay down on the bed he had last shared with Alexandra . Later that day , feverish and a hit groggy from the injections the doctor had given him , he felt his pain yield to a mastering sense of defeat . Ile slept poorly that night , waking each time his weight pressed on the wounded finger , At dawn , he walked through the mistedp60woods to the Stanhope Stables . The morning air lifted from him the traces of narcotic stupor from the day before . He then attended to his ponies . Gaited Amble and Big Lick were usually easy when about to be bridled , but this morning they were skittish , pawing the ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his wound : the dread of sunderedflesh was a remaining link between man and beast . Anguish without ground , guilt without motive , the vice of scruples were the province of man alone . Careful not to jar the bandage on his finger , he proceeded to select with precision the polo tack for the encounter with Eugene , almost as if every piece were an amulet of circumstance , an agent in shaping destiny  --  incapacitation , death or painless triumph  --  which could be influenced before it was brought to pass . He harnessed each pony with its double-reined bridle  --  tightening the noseband , checking the tautness of the bit , the curb chain and lip strap , the length of the martingale  --  then adjusted the slack of the girth under the animal 's belly , cinching the saddle to an exact fit , checking and rechecking the stirrup leathers , and fastening bandages on the horse 's legs . When all was in place , he brought Big Lick and Gaited Amble back to his VanHome . The smell of the stable they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked again the snugness and fit of each saddle . Drenched from labor and dull pain , he went inside the VanHome , undressed , and ran the water for a lukewarm bath . He sat in the tub , his bandaged hand wrapped in plastic , eyes closed , his sensations wayward , his pain the tocsin of conscience . What he faced now was not of his choosing . He had no prior quarrel with Eugene , none with Alexandra . He had initiated no breach , sought no conspiracy . He did not see himself as a victim , bested by their hostility ; neither was he impelled by an image of valor or gallantry , the avenger requiting his humiliation , the hero asserting his potency . He bore his own standard within . The imminence of peril always evoked in him a peculiar fastidiousness . Like a dandy of combat , he surveyed his polo wardrobe , the assortment of his gear , refining his choices meticulously . He and Eugene would be alone on the field , but Fabian prepared for their contest as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the scrutiny of judges , press , television.  |p61He  pulled a fresh shirt over his head and sheathed his legs in new white breeches and his best polo boots , their stiff leather bracing each curve of his muscles ; the resulting splendor appeared to him a conscious rebuttal to the clamor , the foaming sweat and whippingdirt of the game that was about to ensue . He locked in place the zippers on his boots , tightened the suppleleather thongs that fastened his spurs at the correct angle . Even though , quite likely , he would use only one mallet , it was his custom to take several with him , and he did so now , selecting each after he had thoughtfully tested its pliancy and springiness . To Fabian , the intensity of his acts was always knowable ; he seldom had a comparable knowledge of his motive . To track the source of his present act would be no easier than to unravel the tangle within which Eugene and Alexandra acted . He saw the meaning of an act emerging with its consequences , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially prompted it . He conceived of acute self-awareness as vitiating instinct , and meditative self-analysis as digging a grave for action . Living implied the necessity of maintaining his will , even without a motive , with memory fostering remorse for what he had or had not done . Was remorse over a contest , perhaps won , perhaps lost , but fought to the end , less gnawing than regret over a challenge one had refused ? And how could he determine this without discerningwhat his motive was for entering upon the duel he had provoked ? Leaving the door of his VanHome like a crusader compelled to abandon the fastness of his citadel , he turned for a last look at it . His gaze swept the world of objects fashioned by other men ; serene , untouched , invulnerable , they were indifferent to whateverfate might come upon the one who had lately bent them to his use . The events that drove him from this world had been abrupt and inescapable , but he was not yet their victim , not their prisoner ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pores of his skin woiilcl open to the sweaty , viscous reek of his own fear , the pungency of leather and tarnished brass on his tongue.  |p62It  was time to go . He put on his newest polo helmet , the face guard an internal part of it . He swung heavily into the saddle on Big Lick . Pain pounded in his hand . He held it high above the mare 's mane , the reins girdling his wrist . At a slow trot he moved away from the VanHome , Gaited Amble following behind on a lead rein . Eugene was waiting in the middle of the training field . Fabian disengaged Gaited Amble , loosely hitching it to the bars of a crude post at the end of the field . As he approached Eugene , he recognized his mount , one of the swiftest and most powerful Thoroughbreds , its ears pricking with excitement . Fabian looked at Eugene ; from beneath his polo helmet with no face guard , Eugene stared back at him . Without a word , Eugene threw the ball on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball , Eugene hitting it first in a long forehand stroke . Mallet upright in his unmarred right hand , Fabiantightened his grip on the handle . Locking his calves and knees against Big Lick 's withers , thrusting his left shoulder forwardover its neck , Fabian cut his spurs into the pony 's flanks , prompting it to break into its fastest pace . Eugene reached the ball at a full gallop , his mallet erect . He pitched it far back above his shoulder , then brought it down toward the ball in a scything arc . Just then Fabian 's mallet sliced the air ; its head snared Eugene 's mallet . Eugene , jabbing and twisting , unhooked it , but instead of tracking the ball , he sheered his mount , still at taut rein , sideways toward Big Lick , bruising and jostling the mare as both horses plunged on . With a snorting roar , Big Lick tugged cruelly at the reins bound about Fabian 's wounded hand . Eugene kept pricking Big Lick with the tip of his boot , his knee guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation , glistening with patches of foaming sweat , Big Lick bolted . Rearing , gouging the air with its forelegs , the mare fought Fabian , its neck distended and thrust out . Fabian wrenched at the reins , and the horse , obeying , plunged forward . The sudden movement scorched Fabian 's arm and shoulder with a torch of pain . Eugene 's eyes brimmed with contempt as he again swerved his Thoroughbred into Big Lick ; Fabian averted a side collision only by fiercely gagging his mare to an abrupt halt . I leaving inp63pain , the pony swerved on its haunches , then bolted away from Eugene at redoubled speed , kicking the grass in frenzied bounds . As Fabian gained on the ball , striking it toward the edge of the field , he felt his skull girded with the cold despair of certainty . Instead of rushing ahead , hitting the ball toward Fabian 's goal posts , Eugene was lagging behind . Fabian recognized the strategy : Eugene expected him to head off the ball with a back shot , sending it across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time Fabian accomplished the shot , he merely delivered the ball back into Eugene 's arena , and , bolting forward , Eugene recoupedthe ball before Fabian could challenge him for possession . With Fabian now in front of him , Eugene , in a forward shot , sent the ball smashing , not toward the goal posts , but into Big Lick , ominously close to the animal 's head  --  and Fabian 's . Turning for the ball slowed Fabian down ; unfaltering and much faster on his pony , Eugene again seized the ball . Fabian prompted Big Lick into a flat-out gallop and , looking back , caught sight of his opponent straining in a swing ; in that moment , the ball soared , whistling by Fabian 's neck as he bent sideways . It had missed him by an inch . Now , as Fabian bore down on the ball , Eugene behind him in close pursuit , the horses heaving and snorting , Fabian no longer allowed himself to think of his pain . Perception yielded to fear , and he knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene was no longer playing to kill Fabian 's inner conviction of his own mastery : Eugene was playing just to kill . Stick-and-ball offered a convenient guise in case he should succeed . So the patternswiftly emerged : as Fabian went in pursuit of the ball , Eugene followed , riding him off to dodge the track of the ball , bumping him at full gallop , aware that Fabian 's wound of the day before reduced his control and made him more vulnerable . Fabian , who had hardly slept during the last two nights , began to feel stamina seeping out of him . Steadfastly refusing to be drawn into Eugene 's fury , Fabian still hoped that their confrontation on the same field , which , in the past , had so often brought them together , would lessen his friend 's conviction of betrayal . He countered Eugene 's assault by slowing down to an easy pace , then twisted abruptly across Eugene 's path in a sinuousp64thrust , striking the ball at every chance . With the ceaseless leachingof his strength , his legs grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested in his aim , and he wondered how long he would be able to maintain it . An image of himself lying dead on the field dominated his thoughts . Polo , even when played under strict formality , barely managed to restrain the force of human flesh , the speed and mass of the horse . To Fabian , this had been the game 's sheer beauty ; it was now its ultimate terror . He recalled vividly one of the amateur polo games he had witnessed in Los Lemures . During the first two or three chukkers , the pace was leisurely , safe and slow , givingeach player a chance to demonstrate his skills and to relish the accomplishment of the others . One of the players was an old acquaintance of Fabian 's , a recentlyretired American businessman who had arrived for the occasion only two days earlier . He was accompanied by his wife and his two sons , whose wives and children also were in the party , all enthusiastic not only about the holiday , but for the happy chance to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as a young man , and to which , after three decades of what he called executive golf and tennis , he was most eager to return . During the last chukker , a substitute player was enlisted by one of the teams . He was a young ranchero , a local boy , not often given the chance to take part in a game reserved for visitingpolo players . Eager to make his mark in front of his companionsand other spectators , he promptly threw his pony into a reckless display of speed , performing at the same time with an uncanny mastery of the ball . By playing so much faster than others on the field , he engaged the spectators on his side ; cheered for every strike , he forced the line of attack and defense to be extended across almost the entire length of the field . Even though the other players were tired and on the brink of ending the game , prompted by the applause of the spectators , they quickly surrendered to the rapidly increased pressnrc of the game , and Fabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compelledby the speed of his team to uu ) iilire his pony , chasingp65the ball at the same headlong pace as the other , younger players . With only three minutes left to the end of the game , the young ranchero scrambled for the ball in a frantic gallop that left his pony choking for air . The other players , challenged by his aggression , spurred their ponies downfield , jabbing , fighting for possession of the ball . Fabian saw the American suddenly pull out of the scrimmage and , wielding his mallet like a hockey stick , come at the ranchero , attempting to ride him off . As the tumult of hoofs pounded the ground , the crowds in the stands , responding to beat and tremor of the earth , broke into volleys of shouting and applause , inciting the players to goad their sweat-sodden mounts to even more drastic speed . Heedless now of everything but possession of the ball , the ranchero pitched into a steep turn , the American hard on his heels . At that moment , in a blink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of horses and men swelled , then as quickly broke , spilling from its center , in a jet of fluid motion , the glimpse of a horse thrown sideways , then buckling , its neck a sculpture of terror , its rider , the American , frozen in air , a puppet suspended above the empty saddle . Horse and rider went down in the rolling tide of flesh , human and animal , closing then unfolding above the other players , as if what lay on the ground were a prey they had run to earth . One after another , the players began to dismount ; from both ends of the field , the umpires , grooms and the man 's family rushed to the fallen player . They dropped to their knees and bent over him . The setting sun stained the blood that spilled from his head and neck , brimming into the helmet that his fall had knocked askew , oozing through his torn shirt ; nose and jaw lay limply together , pulverized by hoofs ; flesh and cloth blended , matted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , the ponies sniffing blood and the odor of death , prancing in fear , strained at the reins the silent grooms held taut . Now , facing Eugene , Fabian felt his spirit draw back from the vision that had obstructed it  --  and from the fear of death and the seduction of survival . Awake to life , he was in a trance , in which perfection was the brain 's unalloyed response , en/acted by the body with the certainty of sleepwalking . With Eugene racing at Fabian 's left , readying the assault to unseathim , Fabian slowed Big Lick to a canter , the ball at the pony 's right side . In perfect obedience , bobbing its mane imperiously , Big Lick responded instantly . Slightly to the front , Eugene , assuming that Fabian was still dribbling the ball forward , gathered momentum to drive him off course . Poised above the ball , his mallet erect , Fabian rose in his right stirrup and hunched over Big Lick 's shoulder ; he quickly drew his hand close to his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left knee and thigh braced high against the saddle , he unleashedall his strength into his arm , uncoiling it in a long drive beneath the pony 's shoulder . In one smooth , measured blow , Fabian 's mallet struck the ball dead center ; crossing under the pony 's neck , it catapulted into the air just when Eugene slowed down his horse and turned to the side , his mallet vaulting . He arched to look back at his enemy , and in the second that the glance consumed , Fabian 's ball smashed into Eugene 's face , the impact cocking his helmet forward , over his forehead . Amid the din , Fabian caught the high , thin echo of cracking bone . Eugene slumped in the saddle ; his body pitched forward , then tumbled to the ground . Even before Fabian dismounted , he knew that his friend had been felled by a fluke hit.  |p67Memory  was a fraudulent bookkeeper and , with time , Eugenewas little more than a recorded fact , but here , atthe tournament named for him , Alexandra Stahlberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her companion , a man in his early twenties , familiar to Fabian . He was powerfully built , his compact physique defined by the sleek cut of the tuxedo , his patrician head and features molded with a glowing Latin harmony . " This is Jose-Manuel Costeiro . " Alexandra pressed Costeiro 's arm , but her eyes stayed fixed on Fabian . " And this is Fabian , my old friend I told you so much about . " Fabian remembered recent photographs of Alexandra in the society pages of polo and riding magazines ; Costeiro , whom Fabian had once seen playing for the Centauros , was always at her side or somewhere in the background . He came from a distinguishedArgentinean cattle-breeding family who were proud of his skill at polo , but who disapproved of his indulgence in women ; with both , his talent was formidable . As a waiter poured champagne , Fabian felt Alexandra and Costeiro staring at him . He looked quickly at Alexandra across the table . Ilcr face shone with a soft luster , almost childlike , Inp68broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced intensely . " Do you still play polo one-on-one for stakes , Fabian ? " she asked with that easy , ingenuous smile . " It depends on what stakes and against whom , " Fabian replied . " Against me , Senor Fabian , " Costeiro interjected , leaning forward and smiling evenly . He paused , his eyes bright and hard ; then , when Fabian remained silent , he continued . " Two ponies , and first to score five goals  --  with no time limit . " He fingered his glass ; then he proposed a sum . " That 's about three times as much as I can afford , Mr. Costeiro , " Fabian said . " I know you write books about horsemanship and appear on television talk shows ; you ca n't be a poor man , Senor Fabian , " Costeiro said . " In this country , writing books and appearing on television are vanity sports . I make my living on a horse . " Costeiro 's eyes softened as they rested on Alexandra . Then , as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about this : If I lose , you take the full sum . If you lose , I take one-third . Agreed ? " He waited , full of force , eager . Alexandra cocked her head , observing Fabian . No expression betrayed her thoughts . " Agreed , " Fabian said . " Tomorrow morning , then . " Costeiro sat back pensively . " Nine o'clock in the practice field closest to Brook Forest and the Hunter Paces trails . No spectators  --  just my grooms , do n't you think ? " " Gentlemen , gentlemen . " Alexandra broke her silence vivaciously . " Since I arranged this game , do I get my agent 's cut ? " " You 'll get your cut from me , " Costeiro said , all smiles . He looked at his watch . Alexandra interpreted the signal and stood up languidly . Both men rose with her . " Ca n't I even watch the game ? " she asked , pouting , draped against Costeiro 's shoulder . Costeiro embraced her amorously . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind your being there . " " Fabian is my friend . Iie would n't lift his finger against me . Would you , Fabian ? " Fabian raised the ring finger of his left hand . Since the sever/ing , the wound had healed , but the finger remained slightly crooked . " For you , Alexandra  --  not even a finger , " he said with mock courtesy . He watched Alexandra and Costeiro cross the room , then slowly left the club and returned to his VanHome . He climbed the stairs to the alcove and slid the dome open to the night sky . As he shed his party clothes , he contemplated the easy guile with which Alexandra had arranged this match . What was she hoping for ? In the coming game , Costeiro would have advantages over Fabian : he was younger and stronger , with superbly schooled Argentinean ponies at his command . What if , to unleash Costeiro , Alexandra had told him that she and Fabian were once lovers ? Wrapping himself in a warm blanket , still unknowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dawn , moist air cool on his face . Shivering , he looked out through the open dome . Aimless patches of fog roamed the woods , then slipped away , baring a grove of elms . Rising from the thick carpet of underbrush , the trees stood bare , inexplicably stripped of their foliage . He slipped coming down the steps from the alcove , bruising his shoulder against the door . An accident , he wondered , or was he losing his coordination under stress ? In a game , a blur , a smudge , a single break in the chain of coordination might bring him to earth . He knew that his own apprehension and fear were hazards that might , at any moment before or during his fight with Costeiro , bend him to the humiliation of gagging , vomit or the wrenching flood and waste of the body . As a precaution , he began his preparations for the match by quickly forcing his stomach and bowels to rid themselves of food and waste , a cleansing evacuation without pain or any other unpleasantside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travels in countries where the practice of voiding one 's stomach , intestinesand bladder was done at will , a recourse when people wished to pleasure themselves at table without distraction or where a failure or reluctance to continue partaking of the largesse of one 's host would be construed as an insult . Fabian then turned on a tape recorder , raising the volume until it consumed the space around him with random songs andp70melodies he had recorded from his VanHome radio , the music reminding him of an evening with a lover , an afternoon of ease among friends , a day of writing , the whiling away of a forest noon , no menace to cloud the enclosure of his thought . He had listened to this music often , the current of his memory moving toward those interludes of harmony and light . Now , as always when he played it before a game , the music came at him like a rallying cry , a call to arms , the bugle that would alert the line of emotional defense he needed to stave off fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unraveling the knot at his center . Then he lathered and rinsed his hair until it slipped between his fingers . He was careful not to burn his scalp with the hair drier , and he brushed his hair as if he were polishing it , arranging it by habit on both sides of the widow 's peak , a gesture that had become mere reflex by now , a shadow of an atavistic belief that his vigor depended on how much pelt covered his scalp . He brushed his teeth with the firmest brush he had and the powder to which he was accustomed , then he massaged his gums with yet another brush , soaked in a solution that scaled the tissue , a prelude to the jet of water he finally shot into his mouth , laving his teeth and gums , until he felt vivified , without stain . Then , with precision , almost surgically , he shaved , planing his skin to the polish he would bring to a night of love . There was still time to kill , and he trimmed his fingernails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded then to his feet , trimming his toenails , dislodging the dead skin that had formed around them and under the toes . Next he swabbed his ears with wads of cotton , scrutinizing the film of yellow wax , the dirty smudge that soiled the cotton , scouring the channels that curved behind the lobes . Fabian performed all this in earnest , with diligent objectivity , as he had prepared for earlier sieges and combat , much as if his power was determined by the amount of clogging food , fat , wax , husks of dead skin and nail or decay he could strip from the apparatus of his body : a rite of purification , of priming , for the unsullied summons of the encounter . The slight wrench of pain in his back was by now a familiar companion ; he went to sleep with its pressure and awoke at itsp71prod . He had devised a routine to subdue and mitigate it : sleeping with a pillow under his knees , avoiding sharp or abrupt movements , saddling his ponies only when he was squarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the practice field , each time he stood up in the stirrups  --  a mallet in his hand , his shoulders and trunk parallel to the line of the ball , whether veering to the right , poised to strike , or swiveling at his hips , then tilting sharply across the horse to hit on the left  --  each torsion of his body was as adamant as the swinging of an iron gate , pushing the joints and ligaments of his back beyond the point of tolerance , risking a spasm that could immobilize him not only for the instant but for days to come . To support his back now , he wound an elastic brace around his hips , tightening the fabric like a corset until he felt the middle of his body as an unassailable sheath . He took pleasure in that sensation of tautness and inner compression , curiously relishing the knowledge that even though he had to enlist an external instrument , he could still affect the involuntary mechanism of his body . Ready at last , he left his alcove and released Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the VanHome . He saddled them meticulously , strapping a bundle of polo mallets to the rig on Gaited Amble , who would follow on a lead rein , then mounted Big Lick . The practice field was about a mile away , and , relishing what time remained to him before thought must yield to habit , he began to advance on it slowly , the sun like a vast ball in the distance . He slid back in the saddle , without will , his gaze sweeping the shallow meadows , the redolence of thyme and the tart fragrance of damp weeds pricking his nostrils . A surge of longing for the city rose within him , the anonymous lure of its streets , the vortex of men and women , of shape , feature , color making a discordant frenzy in which he could immerse himself  --  a mortal forest , uprooted , divested of its past , of all that bound it to earth . He had acted always in the conviction that to master his life , to assert dominion over that indifferent span , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each scene so charged , so unrepeatable , that no interval could be permitted to divert him from the spectackof which he was both protagonist and solitary witness.  |p72Now  it broke on him savagely that in the theater of his life he had contrived to make of himself a grotesque figure , a Don Quixote of the turnpike , a Captain Ahab , moorless in his big ship of a VanHome , and from the void at his center , a hideous , soundlesslaughter spilled out , derisive , racking him , buckled , polished , poised astride the horse . Contempt for himself , for Alexandra and Costeiro , for deeds of this world and its ways assailed him like an unbearable stench , a wave of vileness he could not breach . In his imagining , the film of Alexandra in his VanHome began again to unwind , the images unrelenting , a whip of vicious poignancy , goading him to desolation , spiking and bloodying a depth of anguish in which he drifted as the reel revolved . He shriveled at the thought of what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorting mirror in his vision and character had seduced him into that image of himself as the gallantknight in a tournament of passion , rather than as the paltry clown in a carnival play . The gall of life , a fever of contempt for the part he had consented to enact , fell on him with all its futile weight . He thrust back in a panic of survival , panting , hot with sudden thirst for the drama before him , tugging at the horse 's bit , goading his spurs deep into its flanks . He punished it with the snaffle and the curb , and the animal reared as if scorched with a hot iron . Fabian began to lash at its neck and belly and flanks until Big Lick , a captive of the bit , whip and spur , hurtled forward , the heave of its bulk parrying the wind , the space ahead a promiseof blows that would cease , pain that would end . Gaited Amble , behind , snorting and squealing , careened at the end of the lead rein . Fabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to halt , numb with astonishment . The field was broken up with posts and rails , oxers , parallel and triple bars , hedges and fences  --  the kinds of obstacles used for jumping competitions  --  perhaps a dozen of them placed at various angles , strewn about without any seeming order of progression . Instantly it dawned on him what Costeiro had done , and with that rush of awareness , a throttling sense of entrapment stormedp73over him , provoking a spasm of nausea , brief and intense ; he steadied himself on Big Lick , swallowing in quick , deep gusts . In the distance , parked at the far edge of the field , he caught the gleam of a sports car , its top down . Alexandra , her helmetedhead a white dazzle in the sun , sat at the wheel . Costeiro , spruce in his riding gear , lounged against the convertible , toying with his mallet , his head hovering over Alexandra . To the right , at the viewing stands , two grooms were adjusting the saddles of the Argentinean 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he hitched Big Lick and Gaited Amble , the ponies calm again after the turbulenceof their ride to the field . He began to stride deliberately toward Alexandra and Costeiro , trying to tug off his riding gloves , sharply aware , as his fingers fumbled with the supple leather , of how cold his hands had gone , gelid sticks , almost rigid . The air was hot on his face and shoulders ; sweat brimmed under his helmet . He looked at his hands , marble with chill pallor . Their cold seemed to him a frost of premonition . He could not tell whether his fear was a response of his flesh , in revolt against a threat to the dominion of character and will ; or whether fear had usurped the very province of that character and will , exposing further some critical lesion in their authority . What he drew strength from was a consciousness of the fitness of his presence , the note of readiness for combat that he gave off in his taut shirt and breeches , the padded leather knee guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipper that split each of them , glistening . Coming at Costeiro in the full blaze of morning , watching the springy power of Costeiro 's shoulders and thighs , the gleam and luster of his face , how fluent with a molten grace his gestures were , Fabian had to acknowledge , envy twitching within him , what a worthy rival the Argentinean was . He remembered Alexandratelling him that what she found most alluring during her Latin American tour was the sight of the native Indian men , their bodies smooth and muscular , always hairless , flesh moving toward sculpture , scolptnre mobile as flesh . The thought of ( ; ostciromolded with Alexandra , the two of them at night together , one sculpture in love with another , rankled , vet he knew that hisp74envy of Costeiro was at root an adolescent urge to escape his own shape , to become , if only in transient fantasy , someone else , another being . Costeiro 's wealth , too , was an insolent rebuke to him , and the humiliation of his own last few hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galled him . He knew he could still cancel the bout with Costeiro , return to his VanHome , stable his ponies , and wait until he was restored . There was time still to retreat to the turret of the cab , switch on the ignition , take up his own rhythm from the surge of the engine , and move ahead , slipping onto the vacant ribbon of the highway . He knew , also , how brief was the time before he could no longer afford to buy fuel for his VanHome , feed his ponies or himself . He might soon have to put his whole way of life up for auction . Interest in his books had been dwindling for years ; now there might be no serious clients to bid on his VanHome , his ponies , his gear and tack . He could live for months on the money that he might win  --  had to win  --  from the Argentinean . The sight of Costeiro , with his youth , security and easy command , reminded Fabian that he could claim no constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his way again , a way uncertain in its prospect and goal . Poverty was a blackmailerwith amiable manners : it left all choices to its victim . He thought of the city and remembered the old , tattered vagrant , trudging and cadging , the yellowing crown of scabs on his head , his feeble hands and lips twitching at the soup , the mumblingmouth . " Good morning , Fabian , " Alexandra called out , a movie camera and a tripod in her hands , her smile flashing with the provocation that never deserted her . She wore a scarred polo helmet ; a moonlightsheen parka , thrown open enough to show the cleavage of her breasts , contrasted with sleek leather pants , tapered down , her ankles wreathed in the golden straps of her sandals . Nodding coolly to Alexandra , Fabian shook the hand of the smiling Costeiro , then pointed at the field . " What 's this obstacle course for ? " he asked . " It 's for us , Senor Fabian , " Costeiro replied . When my poniesp75were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come as no surprise . Alexandra tells me she has seen your horses jumping  --  quitewell , too . " " I thought our game was polo , " Fabian said , " not jumping . " The game is what sportsmen make it , " Costeiro said easily , speaking with that patient condescension reserved for calming the overwrought . " Just as love is how lovers make it , " Alexandra broke in lightly . " What do you make of this , then , Mr. Costeiro ? " Fabian asked evenly , still civil . " I make of this our game . One-on-one polo , with a handicap  --  a few jumping obstacles to even things up between us , " Costeiro replied . " Surely you did n't expect that I , always a volunteer on a team of amateurs , was going to let you , a hippodrome sharpshooter , just shoot all the goals , take the money and run ? " There was a veiled insolence in his tone , but Fabian did not rise to it . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Fabian looked at Alexandra . Her helmet was bent toward the camera , and she pretended not to be listening , her face hidden while she played with the knobs and adjusted the various dials . " What other handicaps have you thought up for me , Mr. Costeiro ? " Fabian asked , still evenly . " Nothing but these . " The insolence gave way to charm . " Today I 'm not in the best form . Last night I taught Alexandra to dance the milonga , the stepmother of the tango . She looked so ravishing , so sexy  --  and , as a result , this morning  --  " He broke off , implyingno explanation was necessary . " Looking sexy is Alexandra 's handicap , " Fabian said . " Indeed it is ! " Costeiro agreed . " And so this morning I 'm sufferingfrom a terrible resaca , what you here call a hangover . " He turned to Alexandra for confirmation . " The hangover evens things up further , " Alexandra agreed , looking up , her eyes unreadable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be grateful to Mr. Costeiro for not having tossed in a bull or a steer so we could also have a rodeo , " Fabian said . Costeiro rose to the spur with a genial smile . " Indeed youp76should , Senor Fabian . The cuchilleros , the knife fighters of the pampas , are , like myself , more fond of the bull and the steer than are you , the cowboys of the baseball field . " " What are the penalties for knocking down an obstacle ? " Fabian asked abruptly . " None , of course . An obstacle is already a penalty . " Costeiro 's smile was tinged with challenge now . " Each time one is knocked down , my grooms will set it up again . That 's all . " Sensing Fabian 's apprehension , Costeiro leaned back against the car , with an amused expression , his hand stroking his mallet . " Of course , no one can force you to jump , Senor Fabian . You can just circle the obstacles . " " While you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . Costeiro broke into laughter . " While I score the goals . " Alexandra switched from her mimicry of absorption to a mimicryof film-making . " Lights ! Camera ! Action ! " she called out brightly , lifting the camera to her sunglasses , pointing the lens first at Costeiro , then at Fabian , then back at Costeiro . " I 'm ready ! " Costeiro announced , slapping his polo gloves against his breeches . " But let 's not coerce Senor Fabian into playing in our film . " " Fabian ca n't be coerced , " Alexandra said , bright still . " Corrupted , yes , but only by vanity . But not coerced . He 's too proud for that . " She pointed the lens directly at Fabian . " I 've never been able to tell whether Fabian is too proud to be vain or too vain to be proud . " " I 'm ready , " said Fabian , his mouth dry with the tension of what had just passed , what was just about to begin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly . He took the helmet from Alexandra 's head and set it on his own , adjusting the chin strap , then put on his gloves . He reached into the sports car for a container of polo balls and handed it to Alexandra . " After we 've ridden across the field to get acquainted with the obstacles , Alexandrawill throw out the ball for us , " he announced . Alexandra took a ball from the container and juggled it eagerly . The promise of competition stimulated her . " First a ball to the players , then a kiss to the winner , " she said . " Or should the loser lx kissed first ? " She took off her sunglasses . " What would youp77say , Fabian ? " She looked at him directly , but even without the sunglasses , Fabian could find no expression in her eyes . " I suppose it depends on the needs of the one who is kissing , " he said . Abruptly , he turned away from Costeiro and Alexandra , and started to walk toward his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leather sheen of his boots , he was conscious of how indifferent he had been to the sun in its healing warmth . Big Lick and Gaited Amble stood calm , submissive , tethered to their posts . Fabian quickly loosened each pony 's martingale , the leather strap that ran from the bit down between the forelegs , circling the horse 's girth ; he also removed a noseband from above its muzzle that was used to prevent the animal from tossing its head about in defiance of pressure from the bit . For his first encounter with Costeiro , Fabian decided on Big Lick , although the pony flinched as he took the reins , neighing in apprehension from the remembered run to the field . He then selected a short , light mallet , its cane flexible , perfect for tricky shots . He swung into the saddle and cantered toward the middle of the field , conscious of the peace , the fresh stains of paint on the obstacles a pleasant blur to his eyes . As Big Lick wove its way around the obstacles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the number of strides the horse must take before each jump . He kept imagining what soon might he a reality : his collision with Costeiro , the rebounding of horses and mallets against the barriers , falling on each other , thrusting , parrying for the ball when it lay between the obstacles or was caught under them . Fabian knew that , by arranging for obstacles and jumps to impede their game , Costeiro hoped to diminish his opponent 's ability to strike well , the very control he claimed he wanted to generate and exploit in their competition . In that strategy , in Costeiro 's scheme to defeat Fabian by the random disordering of the field with harriers  --  thereby imposing on the rider an unnatural , disjointed movement  --  Fabian saw the Argentinean as an exponent of the team mentality , which stressed the passing of the ball from one player to the next to achieve an uninterrupted flow in the game . The irony of the plan , not lost on Fabian , who savored it withp78a grim relish , was that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentinean only confirmed Fabian 's preeminencein the art that issued directly from what Fabian saw as the very essence of any game : the mind of the man who played it , his ambition to take each shot as an independent event , formally detached from what preceded it and from what might follow  --  the reverse of a group code . He tested his speculation by surveying the several practice jumps that Costeiro , his mallet raised upright , took in rapid succession . From a distance , it seemed that his pony cleared each obstacle smoothly , cresting the gentle swell of an invisible wave , sloping fluently with it toward the ground , the jump completed with the animal unshaken , the rider secure in his seat , mallet curved in a hit at the ball . But as Fabian moved closer , intent in his scrutiny , he began to see defects in the Argentinean 's technique . He noticed that , without comprehending the basic realities of jumping , Costeiro exhibited a mannerism , common among polo players , of reining in decisively , clipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cribbing its freedom of movement , forcingthe pony to slow down in the face of the obstacle . By slowing his mount on the brink of a jump , so dangerously close to a blind area of the animal 's vision , the Argentinean nullified its instinctual gift to calculate , from a proper distance , the height and depth of an obstacle , and the momentum and effort needed to clear it . The heavy gear that Costeiro 's grooms had laden on their master 's pony  --  as poorly schooled at jumping , in Fabian 's view , as the man who rode it  --  could easily become an additional handicap . With the pony 's martingale taut under its neck , the noseband dropped low , ready to constrict the nostrils whenever pressure was exerted on the reins , the neck confined , Costeiro 's pony could neither raise its head to see the obstacle at close range nor stretch out its neck to achieve balance in preparation for a jump . With so many restraints , Costeiro had only reinforced the pony 's habit , artificially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints in its hind legs only , somewhat like a rabbit or a kangaroo , instead of relying , in a jump , on the freedom and momentum of its entire mass . As Fabian threaded his way among the obstacles , Big Lickp79intermittently shying and bucking at one or another of them , he continued to contemplate Costeiro 's strategy , to ponder his own . , fc He concluded that the Argentinean , like so many other polo olc players , valued teamwork and the urgency of the game , its inces-sant Zsvolley of pressure , danger , skill ; solitary forms of horseman-ship  --  evenjumping  --  presented themselves as inferior in drama . Ln ; and thrill , and therefore were to be carried out casually , as gentlemanlydiversions that called for no further authority , preparationor expertise . He was distracted by a slight commotion at the fringe of the field . Two of Costeiro 's grooms helped Alexandra set up the sic camera on its tripod , and Fabian saw her in the distance , the oiE sheen of her jacket a luminous backdrop to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her with several fresh rj l jumps , now hitting a ball one of the grooms threw to him , radiatingthe conviction , as his mount cleared the obstacles , that he elf was as accomplished a jumper as he was a polo player . Fabian n r observed that whenever Costeiro 's pony was accelerating to clear IRI the obstacle , the Argentinean , plying his mallet in anticipation ri r of striking the ball , would tilt over the horse 's mane , shifting his weight above its shoulders , burdening its forelegs before his horse had a chance to clear the obstacle . If he was about to at-tempta back or side shot , he would bend back or sideways , , a shifting his weight onto the pony 's rear , burdening its hind legs zoo with further weight . In both instances , Costeiro carelessly tended lx to tip the pony off balance at the exact moment when , to hurdle o e the barrier , the animal most needed its balance . It was time to practice . Fabian threw Big Lick into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the obstacles . . , The mare took the jump smoothly , the hoofs of its forelegs z ; 5 higher than its belly , hind legs tucked in neatly behind the thighs , lifting its heaviest bulk in a clean sweep above the barrier , the 5e pony 's performance a reward for the time and care he had spent fit in maintaining Big Lick and Gaited Amble at jumping . He repeated the maneuver , continuing to guide the horse solely with his legs , his hand gently holding the reins , his mallet at t t the ready . Each time he jumped , giving Big Lick its lead , the freedom to stretch out its neck , to balance its head , Fabian was zs careful to maintain a steady seat and not to shift his weight in a gatp80polo saddle that did not offer the support of one properly canted for jumping . To curb any association of jumping with pain , which could impel the mare to stop short in front of an obstacle and unseat him , he refrained from using the whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse too abruptly after it had cleared the obstacle . A half-dozen of Costeiro 's grooms moved into positions along the field and at the goal posts . Costeiro raised his arm , a signal that he was ready to start . Now he and Fabian began to ride toward the center of the field . Alexandra , her hair a liquid fan about her neck , stepped from behind the camera as the two men advanced toward her . Fabian saw the white ball in her hand ; he sensed the stir she created , a schoolgirl about to play , waiting avidly for the signal to toss the ball . As Fabian and Costeiro came to a halt at the edge of the field , she threw the ball in , a lithe arc cleaving the morning light . Beforeit tumbled to a halt beside them , Costeiro , heaving in his zeal to get at it , already seized by the heat of the game , swerved his pony , his mallet scooping the ball gently into the air . As it scythed upward , he chased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly negotiating a parallel bar in pursuit of the ball . Just as his horse crested the bar , he caught the ball in flight , arrowing it toward the goal . Fabian , three lengths behind , unable to overtake him , watched the Argentinean 's pony take three more obstacles with springy ease . About a hundred yards from the goal , Costeiro bore down on the ball . Once again his mallet made faultless contact with it , a clap of triumph . In vaulting catapult , the ball drove straight between the posts  --  making the goal . Spurts of applause , yelps of Latin exultation and encouragementerupted from his grooms at the goal posts and the fringes of the field . Costeiro , slowing down , raised his hand to announce his scoring the first point . Tipping the brim of his helmet , the Argentinean , flushed with the pride of his performance , his habit of command unruffled , pranced his pony about in front of Alexandra'scamera , responding to her wave of victory with the homage of his raised mallet . As Costeiro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting point , a groom handed her a fresh ball , and she burst out from behind the camera , glowing with excitement . Boldly she threw the ball down , like a challenge , between the two men . This time , the ball rolled close to Fabian , yet he felt sluggish , torpid , uncertain whether he was able to muster the spirit to match Costeiro . Preoccupied with the attraction between Alexandraand Costeiro , with the Argentinean 's mastery in hitting the ball , Fabian still missed the contour of his own will , the bent of his own strategy : whether to play the ball or to play Costeiro . With the first few shots , the sweat began to bead under Fabian 's helmet , trickling into his eyes , blurring his vision , forcing him to blink more often ; soon its taste was salty on his lips , and it began dripping down his neck and chin . His left hand holding the whip and reins , his right gripping the mallet , he could not pause long enough to lift his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , he lowered his head , looking straight down , at the lush turf that glided , like a conveyor belt in perpetual , verdant motion , under his horse . The surface and depth of the grass were clear to him , every parched patch , every emerald strip . His eyes recorded mechanically the burnt-out blades of grass , mangled and flat , that smeared the head of his mallet at each strike , the dew that the ball , almost as if sweating , trailed like a fine mist in its course . To ready himself for the challenge of a strike , Fabian drew on his fund of mental blueprints , envisioning the moment of the hit upon him : his mallet in a swing at the lowest point of the ellipse of his arm , now moving upward , toward the point of impact that lay slightly ahead of the line of his foot , the flippingarc of his wrist adding speed to the mallet just when its head met the ball below its dead center , lofting it into the air with the concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , even the breeze that , cooling his neck , sped him onward . He outflanked Costeiro and with an effortless stroke hit the ball , sending it swiftly on its way , to rest just inches from a triple bar . He had broken into a fast canter , clearing crossbars as he beat his way toward the white blur , when he realized that Big hick had misread his command and was not slowing down enoughp82for him to strike the ball . The mare plowed into the parallel bars with its chest , knocking the rails noisily askew , ribbons of color splintering beneath Fabian . Just then , Costeiro , seizing the chance , jammed through , goading the pony into a clever prance over the fallen bars , pushing Big Lick off balance . The ball his again , he launched a perfect backhand at it , and as it reeled into the distance , he curbed his mount ; the pony , rearing , choked as Costeiro swiveled and took off after the ball . Breasting a pair of triple bars and two post-and-rails in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air again , catching it with a blow as it hurtled over the field . The ball , a thread of white , whistled toward the goal . Fabian , helpless , watched as Costeiro scored for the second time . The two men took starting positions again , changing sides . Alexandra pitched in a ball , and Costeiro , alert to the challenge of Fabian coming at him from the side , took off at full gallop , steadying himself as he reached the ball . His mallet missed it by an inch , but before he could return to claim it , Fabian charged up from the other end of the field ; his legs hard on Big Lick , hurdling the post-and-rails , he bumped into Costeiro , riding him off and taking the ball by swatting it under the pony 's neck . Costeiro would not slacken his speed , and bore down as both riders simultaneously jumped a wall barrier . He could not pass Fabian , but uncoiling his mallet in a full swing , he propelled the ball into a tumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stirrups , Costeiro wheeled his foaming pony abruptly , circling back to snatch the ball from under the hedge , spoiling Fabian 's chance for a shot at the goal . Just as Fabian readied Big Lick to breast a double set of postand-rails , to retaliate with a back shot , Costeiro came at him from the side . The Argentinean 's mount jarred Fabian 's pony into a skid that knocked both obstacles sprawling in front of Fabian before he could steady himself in the saddle and bring Big Lick to balance . Gagging his pony , Costeiro forced it into a veering side collision with Fabian . Big Lick , tossing in panic , reared . Fabian , the animal plunging beneath him , felt one boot slip from the iron clasp of the stirrup . Ile lurched to the side , on the brink of losing his seat.  |p83At  that moment , off balance , the security of his saddle awry , Fabian saw the ball . It was within reach , luring him , a summons he could not deny . His arm wheeling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body , his eye stalking the ball , he stretched his arm , launching the mallet with a wrench of his shoulder , smashing at full tilt , the ball soaring into a high , liquid arc , steep above the barriers . As the ball spun against the air , the hand of the groom at the goal post was raised in announcement : Fabian had scored his first point . There was a mild flurry of scattered applause . A rush of blood invaded Fabian 's brain , the tides of breath pounding in his ears and throat . From a distance , he saw Costeiro 's friendly salute as he wheeled and rode toward his grooms , apparently having decided to change his pony . Alexandra gave no sign of recognition , moving out quickly to meet the Argentinean , who embraced her after he dismounted . For a moment , they looked at Fabian , who was beginning to circle the field slowly on Big Lick ; then they turned away , retreating into their intimate whispering . As he watched them , Fabian was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this field , he knew his strategy . He returned to the starting point , watching as Costeiro took his new pony over each obstacle , priming it , the grooms calling out in Spanish . Fabian chose to keep Big Lick , although the mare , lathered and foaming , shining with sweat , quivered and trembledstill . He stroked and gentled the horse , readying it for the next bout . He was aware of Alexandra ignoring his presence as she busied herself with the camera . When a groom scrambled toward her with a ball , she took it from him coolly and moved toward the rim of the field . Without a glance at Fabian , she tossed it before the Argentinean gently , almost an invitation . Fabian and Costeiro collided in their rush to it . Attempting a long tail shot , the Argentinean coiled his mallet in a whipping stroke that lunged up to catch Fabian under the brim of his helmet . Dizzied , Fabian swayed in his saddle , Big Lick suddenly aimless beneath him , the painted jumps and bars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green . Costeiro circled back , pivoting his horse , smiling and gesturingp84a sportsman 's apology . Fabian , the daze of the blow receding , Costeiro 's blur of words drifting across the stir of the horses , met the Argentinean 's eyes , gleaming , alert . He attempted the response of the field , but the answering smile would not come : he remembered his troubled thoughts of the night before . Quickening to his instinct , Big Lick shot out , shoving Costeiro to the side and crowding his mount ; Fabian and Costeiro locked and unlocked mallets in a melee over the ball . In the breach that opened between them , Fabian caught sight of the ball , directly in front of Big Lick 's legs . Collecting the horse , thrustinghimself well into the saddle , he drove the ball straight from under the pony 's neck . It shot across the field , a white pellet winking in the sun , vaulting over two obstacles . Cutting off Costeiro , he took after it , clearing both jumps as he bore down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lick was about to clear an oxer , the last obstacle before the goal posts , and pounded the ball high into the air . He could feel Big Lick gathering , bunching lithely to hurdle the obstacle . To keep his seat secure , Fabian forked his body tautly , tightening his legs around the horse 's ribs . At the pitch and zenith of his flight , he closed in on the ball , infusing his mallet with the mass and momentum of the horse , with the surge of the leap , with his own energy and will , a radiantstream of force cresting at full flood on the very brink of its shuddering collapse . Wood cracking on wood , the head of his mallet overtook its quarry . He watched the ball 's passage between the posts . He had scored his second goal . The game was at a draw . Once again , Fabian and Costeiro returned to the starting point , passing each other with a cool formality as they observed the ritual of changing sides of the field . The Argentinean 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing at the rim of the field , ignored both players , calculated , then hurled the ball out well over their heads , almost defiantly , mustering a force she had not drawn upon before . With the ball behind them , Costeiro and Fabian swiveled instantly , plunging their ponies over the first two obstacles , their jumps parallel lines of force , merging almost in an alignment so close that it seemed they wanted to ride each other off while still in flight . Big hick 's eyes bulged in panic , skidding and shootingp85sideways , as the mare breasted a barrier , measuring the space between itself and a horse it did not know . The riders cleared the brush-and-rails , but the savage competition went on , a jostling duel as they bore down on the next obstacle . Fabian found himselfbraking Big Lick as the Argentinean snaffled his mount pitilessly at the approach to the parallel bars . Under strips of cheerful color , nestling in the green turf , the ball lay , waiting . A fight for possession broke out . Thwarting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount at Big Lick 's neck and haunches , butting and bunting , trapping the mare in the tangle of trampled rails . Canting Big Lick against the other pony , Fabian struck back , his knee guards ripping at Costeiro 's , hooking , then breaking loose , their mallets hissing as they whipped the air , flogging the legs of their prancing ponies , catching their hoofs , cramming the air with a staccato rattle of wood barking on wood , wrenching , the cracking noise a tide about Fabian 's ears , drowning the rush of his breath , his pitching chest . The ponies , foaming with panic and effort , their eyes wheeling in terror of the turmoil and of each other , reared violently , bucking and trampling . Its haunches pushed against the rails , Big Lick bolted , as if seared by a bar of flame , dislodging the rails with a swift kick of its hind legs ; taking their flailing tumble as a springboard , the mare now catapulted forward , shoving Costeiro and his pony bristling in frenzy to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect side back shot . While Costeiro tried to calm his pony , Fabian turned Big Lick on its hocks and followed the ball , striking it again , sending it in a sleek skim over a fence well before he cleared that obstacle , then , after the jump , whipping the ball straight toward the goal . Only two obstacles , one post-and-rails and one triple bar , remained before him . He was standing in the stirrups , already coiling his arm , poised to launch the mallet in a stroke that would send the ball over both obstacles , arrowing to its target , when he saw Alexandra . Hoveringover her camera , she was midway at the side of the field , only a few yards away from where the ball had come to rest . FollowingFabian 's run , waiting to catch his stroke , the camera an extensionof her profile , Alexandra adjusted the aperture . In the lens of his thought , Fabian saw the face lie would re-ueniber always , hovering over his bcxly , a face he had toue find , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Alexandra 's head , leveling her ear , the ruptured veins spurting blood , her jaw fallen away , pulverized bone burying one eye , a slimy mussel in its splintered shell , her forehead an oozing fissure in a skull like a discarded visor , the jet of blood from her temple rising , bright crimson . He was almost on the ball now , one part of his brain measuring the span between his mallet and the ball , the speed of the pony , the distance to the goal , another instantly denying the image of that bloodied face , imposing on it the black shield of the camera , its knobs and dials beacons in the sun , flickering only inches from the softness of her face , the tumult of her cascading hair . As he bore down on the ball , he tightened his grip on the mallet . In one slope of unbroken impulse , his body canted to the plane of the ball , his arm raised , straightening , wheeling with impetus , his shoulder following , his wrist flexing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of Big Lick 's trunk , swinging down , connecting the very center of the mallet 's head to the equator of the ball in a clap of annihilating force . The ball rose into the light , flying like a skeet target bolted from its trap . Fabian looked full into the sun , his eye on the ball , its faint whining above him . His eyes flickering for a second on the silver blur of Alexandra , he watched the ball . It descended , pounding into the camera , shattering against it , tumbling it and the tripod down . Alexandra was left standing , her hands to her head , her screaming spilling over the field , the jab of Costeiro 's mallet on Fabian 's arm , flogging , flailing , dragging him to a halt . " What happened , what happened ? " the Argentinean shouted , his face a storm of rage , vaulting from his pony even before it stopped and breaking into a run toward Alexandra , his mallet a discarded toy . Three grooms rushed toward Alexandra apprehensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up the mangled camera . Fabian got off Big Lick and followed Costeiro calmly to where Alexandra stood , her hands twisting her hair , damp with fright , the mask of her composure askew , tears brimmingin her eyes focused in a dead stare . " Alex , are you hurt ? " Costeiro asked , taking her urgently , almostbrutally , by the shoulders , searching her face , his hands plyingher head and neck and throat , then thrusting her , limp in hisp87grip , away from him . As she began to sob , he shuddered with relief , bringing her closer , his mouth on her forehead , whispering away her fear , brushing straw from her jacket , stroking her neck . Fabian watched the scene impassively ; the grooms were openly excited and curious . " I 'm terribly sorry , " Fabian said . " My pony slipped just as I was about to strike the ball  --  just as I hit it . " " You could have crippled Alexandra for life , you could have killed her . " Costeiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , Alexandra looked at Fabian . Her throat was still pulsing with terror , but the first wave had passed , leaving her listless . " I know you did n't mean it , Fabian , " she mumbled . Fabian could not decipher whether her incoherence was the result of the accident or a fresh resumption of the mask , as she went on , her voice a drifting trail . " I know that if you meant it , it would n't have been the camera . " She slumped against Costeiro 's shoulder . " The man strikes but God carries the blow . " Costeiro was suddenlyformal with an impersonal wisdom . " Alex should be thankfulto God she is still alive , " he said gravely , one hand caressing her hair . He turned to look at Fabian evenly , coldly . " And you , that you did n't kill her . " " I am , " Fabian said . " Do we continue our game , Mr. Costeiro ? " They went back to their ponies . As he picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Alexandra . Fitful , she sat hunched on the grass . Costeiro touched the mallet to his helmet as a signal , and one of the grooms threw in the ball . The game continued . Costeiro 's first moves were sluggish , and Fabian realized that the Argentinean'sthoughts were with Alexandra . In the first scuffle , he lost the ball to Fabian , who tracked it easily , in free flight across the field , taking one obstacle after another without incident . Then Costeiro , his pony whinnying at the incessant use of the whip , the spurs bloodying its flanks , swerved to bear down , hard in the wake of Fabian , only inches behind Big Lick . Fabian knew that if Big Lick were to slow down , Costeiro might run into him ; if the mare refused a jump , the slam could be dangerous . Instinct mobilized him again , every power alert , as he recognized that Costeiro 's aim might now be to punish him for the incident withp88Alexandra . He slackened the reins and with his legs gently prodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple bar ; but just as the mare was about to take it , he braced himself in the saddle , and threw all his weight and strength to one side , forcing Big Lick to sidetrack the jump . The maneuver was swift and , in the classic response of the polo man , Costeiro , desperate to bring his pony to heel , made the blunder of wrenching at the reins , locking the martingale and noseband in a vise that strangledhis pony 's nostrils and bridled it , momentarily choking the animal 's breathing . Its sight of the barrier having been obstructed by Big Lick , Costeiro 's pony confronted an obstacle it had not seen from afar and was now too close to see well . Punished by the reins , panicking at the looming presence of the triple bar , the horse reared violently , pitching Costeiro , bent forward in readinessto take the jump , over its head and into the barrier . Seizing the moment , in a series of smooth forehand strokes , Fabian propelled the ball to its target . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored his third goal . Costeiro was shaken and disheveled by his fall . Flecks of blood from a gash in his arm spotted his shirt . Two grooms rushed toward him , one retrieving his pony , aimless without its rider . On impulse , the Argentinean said he would continue to play . But as he moved to pick up his mallet , his mouth twitched in pain . " I think I 've twisted my ankle , " he said , his eyes reluctant to meet Fabian 's . Then , feigning the nonchalance of the sportsman , he added , " It 's your game , Senor Fabian . " " We could continue at some other time , " Fabian said . " Another time would be another game . I seem to have been thrown out of this one . " Leaning heavily on the arm of a groom , Costeiro grimaced sharply and for a moment looked up , his eyes brisk with their earlier fire . He held out his hand as Fabian dismounted . Alexandra joined them , still pale and tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your stakes will be at the club , " Costeiro said indifferently , then reached toward Alexandra . " Let 's go home , my love . " He did not look back as she led him limping off the field.  |p89Fabian  often contemplated the vagaries of fortune , whoseperverse whim it so often was either to grant the fulfillmentof his deepest wishes when he had already ceased to entertain them or to exact as the penalty of that fulfillment a consequence that always lay concealed in the gift . It was in this mood of chagrin that he would sometimes recall his time as a polo partner in the service of the once celebrated Fernando-Rafael Falsalfa , the unchallenged autocrat of the Latin American republic of Los Lemures , an island rich in much of the world 's supply of tobacco and sugar . Then Fabian had known a feeling of permanence , his capacities and powers acknowledged and financially rewarded . Within that security , he was free to indulge whatever pleasure might invite him , the rhythm of his days broken by no event that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , sometimes with irony , as his country 's El Benefactor . Already advanced in age at the time he engaged Fabian , he used an occasional polo playing to foster his image as an active , virile man , as much a macho sportsman as he was , at least in his own eyes , a master statesman . To retain that image , he could not have for a polo partner a local player , who night concciyalhly talk and so dispel one of the myths El Belle/factor had so carefully nurtured . The translation of Fabian 's books into Spanish and their publication in Latin America had first brought him to the attention of Falsalfa and prepared the way for his entry into the sealed world around El Benefactor . Fabian soon found himself installed , with a salary equal to that of a high public official , in one of the splendid bungalows facing the sea at Casa Bonita , Falsalfa 's sumptuous private villa in La Hispaniola , the Caribbean resort which was his private property . Only two hours by car from Ciudad Falsalfa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bequeathed his name , La Hispaniolawas a spectacular resort of lavish private homes and villas , immaculate polo fields , stables of hundreds of the choicest ponies , along with an array of seasoned grooms to tend them , and facilities for some of the best golf , tennis and boating in the hemisphere  --  anopulent monument to the art of conspicuous consumption . Rich and worldly travelers arrived at La Hispaniola by private jet each season to relish the resort 's natural and man-made pleasures . Casa Bonita , as well as the resort of which it was part , offered to El Benefactor a retreat from the demands of his responsibilitiesas head of state . It had also become a shelter from the claims of his aging wife and numerous children and grandchildren , all of whom were sequestered either in the presidential palace at Ciudad Falsalfa or in any number of princely resorts around the island . Casa Bonita , however , was reserved for El Benefactor alone , as well as for those members of his retinue who , like Fabian , in no way threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private and social life while in La Hispaniola . Fabian 's sole duty at Casa Bonita was to be available whenever El Benefactor decided that he wanted to play polo : either stickand-ballpractice or a one-on-one game . Team games were sometimes staged for the purpose of affordingan opportunity to film Falsalfa in a few moments of play , sequences that would then be edited artfully to suggest that he had actually taken part iii the game as a member of the victorious team . In all such instances , Falsalfa relied on Fabian for his counsel , company and discretion ; it was Fahi:ui 's task to supervise preparations for the game , as well as to instruct the other players ,  |p91already  screened and approved by Falsalfa 's secret service , in the strategies of the scenario that had been arranged for them . Even though he had been hired by Falsalfa as a member of his staff , Fabian 's position in his entourage was more that of an intermittentconfederate , an acquaintance in residence , than it was that of an employee . Some of this he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to his new foreignbornpartner at polo , the charm of a novelty and surprise . With time , Fabian , scrupulous never to overstep the bounds of his role , became a fixture in Falsalfa 's household , invited to take advantage of the facilities of the house and resort . Only the imminent arrival of El Benefactor and whatever nonofficialguests he would bring with him from the capital interruptedthe luxury of Fabian 's pleasures and days . Under the apprehensive eye of Casa Eonita 's security chief , ever mindful of the fate of his predecessor , who had been stripped of rank and imprisoned as a punishment after the villa 's lights had gone out during an evening cocktail party at which Falsalfa had been host , the villa now became a hive of frantic preparation . The usually phlegmatic servants were suddenly busy cleaning , polishing , disinfecting ; nothing escaped their attention , from the vaultingdome of the main living room , giant tortoise shells adorning each column of the walls that supported it , to the needle of the record player in the adjacent sound studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energetically deploying their electric cutters and clippers . Random debris of leaves , insectsand other casualties of nature were skimmed off the pool , and its level of chlorine was meticulously checked . At the villa 's marina and heliport , in its garages and the hangars of its airstrip , the squadron of mechanics and engineers systematically inspectedand cleaned every piece of machinery and equipment , certifying its fitness , its ultimate safety . Later in the afternoon , to the distant drum of paratrooperson drill in preparation for whatever chance inspection they mightbe put on by any one of the autocrat 's military comrades , whooften accompanied him to La Hispaniola , Falsalfa 's presidentialjet would land , gliding to a halt in front of a broad avenue thatled directly to the gates of Casa Bonita . The weekend had begun . As soon as El Benefactor stepped onto the runway , flanked byp92his bodyguards , followed by the entourage of guests who had been chosen to spend the weekend with him , a cascade of flowers , strewn by his household staff , spilled before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he had returned from months of exile , instead of the brief span of days that had elapsed since his last visit . The roster of guests who drifted in and out of Casa Bonita during each of those weekends was formidable , some arriving only for drinks , others enlisted for fishing , water-skiing , sailing parties and occasional tours of the island 's interior . The guests included powerful figures in industry and commerce , chiefly American but British and European as well , a number of Latin American aristocrats who owned villas in La Hispaniola , and bankers and businessmen , many of whom engaged in trade with the Republic of Los Lemures . Officers of local and foreign sugar and tobacco corporations were usually in evidence , as well as the omnipresent military advisers , confreres and cohorts of the autocrat . For all of them , an invitation by Falsalfa , and especially one to dinner at Casa Bonita , was a visible sign of election , a tangible reward for diligence and devotion in supporting not only Falsalfa but the right and authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dinners , a blaze of display in the great dining hall , twin ranks of a dozen guests each flanking the main table , Falsalfa posted at its head , that Fabian found his glance returning to a guest , a woman sitting diagonally across from him . She was in her early twenties , with an obvious , intense Latin beauty . Unlike the other women who so often decorated Falsalfa 's table during his weekends at Casa Bonita , she was dressed simply , more by necessity than by choice , Fabian gleaned , a wedding band being her only jewelry , and something still of the teen-ager remaining in the charming but slight unripenessof her manner . Fabian doubted that she would have detainedhim had it not been for her eyes : large and expressive , they commanded her entire countenance . Since protocol at Casa Bonita determined that dinner guests were usually presented only to the host and seldom introduced to each other , Fabian did not know who she was . After dinner , he followed her as guests moved from the dining room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens of the villa and the sea . He had started to introducehimself when she turned with a smile of affection toward an older man who approached them . " Francisco de Tormes , " the man announced formally , bowing slightly to Fabian , " and my wife , Elena . " Fabian recognized the name immediately : Francisco de Tormes , the republic 's most controversial political columnist , was critical of Falsalfa and his one-man regime . When various internationalcoalitions had threatened Los Lemures with economic reprisals in response to what they saw as excesses of Falsalfa 's power , El Benefactor permitted the strictures of de Tormes to serve as a proof of the country 's freedom of the press . De Tormes was conscious of the public awareness of his precariouspolitical status ; he observed casually but pointedly how much pleasure he and his wife took in the beauty of Casa Bonita , particularly in view of their imminent departure from Los Lemures . He explained that he had accepted the invitation of a notable American school of journalism to join its faculty for a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and his wife of only four months would be leaving for North America . As he spoke , Elena de Tormes stood close to her husband , her elbow brushing his hip . She was little more than a third his age , but she seemed to have a rare maturity of spirit , a deep attachmentto her husband , a unique engagement with his nature and being . The charm of Elena de Tormes was contagious , and as Fabian felt himself succumbing to it , the cluster of guests parted discreetly , revealing the presence of Falsalfa , imperial in the white splendor of his uniform as the Generalissimo . As he bore down on Fabian and de Tormes , he extended his arm , greeting the columnist in embrace first , then in full view of the watching guests , kissing the hand of his wife . " So here you are , " Falsalfa called out heartily , " and conspiring against me no doubt ! " He finished , the joke heavy , as he clapped Fabian on the shoulder . " Indeed we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintainthe levity while ( le Tonnes smiled uneasily and his wife busied herself with her fan . " I was just thinking of inviting Senor and Senora de ' Formes to go with me on a trip to the interior , top94visit on horseback some of the less accessible settlements of Cacata . " At Fabian 's proposal , de Tormes made a gesture of dissent . " In my work , I do n't have much chance to practice riding , and as a student , neither does Elena , " he said deferentially . " We might only be a burden , Mr. Fabian . " Fabian , sensing his apprehension , was about to propose anotherdiversion , when Falsalfa curbed him with a smile . " Come , now . It 's a splendid idea , " Falsalfa said . " What a pity that I ca n't join you . " He turned his eyes on de Tormes , a veiled displeasure behind his joviality . " But is our famous de Tormes still interested in the primitive villages of his own country , which he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States ? " Falsalfa 's bitterness toward political fugitives from Los Lemures who opposed him from the safety of the United States was notorious , and de Tormes flushed at the public chiding . Elena de Tormes broke in apprehensively , her fan slicing the air . " Please remember , Excellency , we will only be visiting the United States for a year . It is my first journey abroad , the honeymoontrip Francisco promised me . " " I wo n't forget , my dear , I wo n't forget , " Falsalfa assured her , his manner softening . When his glance returned to de Tormes , he was again the essence of suavity and charm . " It 's settled , then , " he announced decisively , " but surely , de Tormes , you and your delightful wife must see Cacata before you go . " He turned to Fabian . " Order the best horses dispatched , at once . My helicopterwill be at your disposal early tomorrow . " Falsalfa closed the incident with a lordly gesture , dismissing de Tormes and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Meanwhile , we have our polo to plan for , " he announced so expansively he could not fail to be heard . " Let us retreat to the library , " he concluded , guiding Fabian firmly through the dividing crowd . Trailed by bodyguards , Falsalfa pulled Fabian toward him with an air of mischievous conspiracy . " Are n't you even going to thank me for what I have done for you ? " he whispered in his thick English . " For what you have done , Excellency ? " Fabian stammered . " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . " Falsalfa stopped and pinched him gently on the cheek . " I amp95old enough to be your father , Fabian . You have no secrets from me . " He quivered with laughter . " I saw you exchanging glances with the pretty wife of that sly fox de Tormes . " Falsalfa chuckled with amorous speculation . " I met Senora de Tormes for the first time at dinner tonight , " Fabian protested . " I can assure you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't say anything yet , Fabian , " Falsalfa interrupted , suddenlysober . " I have no right to pry into your feelings . " The amiability returned . " In any case , " he continued , " I 'm glad you 'll be on this trip with a woman you want . Let 's hope you 'll find a moment to be alone with her in Cacata . " Fabian attempted to disengage himself from Falsalfa 's romanticillusion . " But Senor de Tormes is going with us , Excellency , " he began . " And I do n't hope , I was n't really planning  --  " Falsalfa'seruption of laughter made him break off in embarrassment . They had arrived at the door of the library . " Have a good trip , Fabian , " Falsalfa said indulgently . " And when you make love to Elena in the jungle , watch out for our famous tarantulas  --  otherwise de Tormes might find one for you . " The gusty insinuation of his laughter dissolved into the library , followed by the mute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left before a closed door . Fabian made the preparations for the trip as Falsalfa had ordered . He was told that horses had been dispatched by an army horse van to the place he had selected for the departure point , along with two guides whose services he had often made use of on other trips to the interior . His plan was to accompany the de Tormeses on the helicopter from Casa Bonita and to rendezvous with the guides and the horses at the site agreed upon . Two to three hours of steady horseback travel would be required to reach one of the oldest and most isolated settlements perching high above the river 's rocky bank . They would have a picnic lunch there , and a helicopter would come for them in time to return to Casa Bonita for late afternoon tea . On the following day , Fabian was up at dawn , the sun still a hazy dazzle on the glassy surface of the sea . IIe and the couple met for breakfast on one of the villa 's smallp96terraces , the motionless air and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Tormes , in the sturdy twill and khaki the trip called for , was radiant with anticipation . Her husband , dressed , like Fabian , in heavy boots , double-padded cotton breeches worn under chaps , and the thick , soft shirt he would need for protection against jungle insects , might have been a prosperous Latin landowner setting out to inspect his cattle . At breakfast , Fabian showed Francisco de Tormes a map of the terrain they would be covering , pointing out the route the helicopter would take to the outpost at which the horses awaited them , then the small Indian settlement deep in the jungle that was Fabian 's goal for their excursion . A powerful clatter of sound from a military helicopter descendingon an adjacent stretch of grass broke the morning calm . The standard it bore identified it as the helicopter reserved for Falsalfa'sprivate use . The pilot , an air force captain Fabian had not previously met , wore the special insignia of the palace brigade , the crack troops Falsalfa maintained solely to guard his person . Fabian and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping arc , the guards at the gates waving it on cheerfully , the deep brick colors of Casa Bonita , its terraces and roofs , dropping away beneath them . Soon the brilliant patchwork of villas and hotels of La Hispaniolayielded to endless stretches of thickly massed fields of sugar cane , slashed symmetrically by access routes and the single-line railroad that connected the fields with the sugar mill. ) m rude dirt paths leading to the railroad , they saw huge carts of sugar cane moving slowly behind six or eight oxen , but even these glimpses of life gradually ceased . I he helicopter tracked the jungle , dense with greenery , studdedwith explosions of rock erupting from the bristling green mat . It hovered low over a river , where alligators idled on a sandy bar , then it skimmed a clearing in the brush , tawny with sun , where a herd of wild goats scampered at the roar of the ma ( him. , and a startled boar staggered from its haunt in the hush , angry with menace , then vanished into the thicket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red clay that jutted out from the end of a strip of dirt path slicing through thep97wilderness . Fabian saw horses and the shapes of the guides waiting below . The helicopter quivered to a halt . The pilot verifiedthe exact location and the precise time at which the helicopterwas to arrive at the Indian settlement to collect passengers for the trip back , then , touching his cap in salute , shook hands with Fabian . As Fabian led Elena and Francisco onto the patch of brick earth , the helicopter took off , a shower of clay and dust veiling it from their sight . Fabian expected to find the two guides he had requested . Now he was startled to be faced by two men new to him , each squat , with thick , wiry hair , a sheathed machete at his waist , and a submachine gun over his shoulder . One of the guides explained that they needed their guns for protection when , at the close of the excursion , after the helicoptercollected Fabian and his guests from the Indian settlement to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to ride back through the jungle , with valuable horses in their keeping . The guides moved about briskly , adjusting stirrup leathers and tightening girth straps , as Fabian inspected the horses and the tack , as well as the provisions in each saddlebag  --  the food that had been prepared for their picnic lunch and medical packs for an emergency . Mounted on the waiting horses , the group started into the jungle , one guide at the head of the column , Elena behind , Fabian trailing Francisco , and the second guide bringing up the rear . After two hours at a fast , steady pace , they veered onto a narrowpath high along the banks of the Yuma . The trail had ended . The river here was at its widest , in full flood , swarms of wild birds nesting in the marshes , indifferent to the passing cavalcade . With only the sinewy back of Francisco shielding him from a glimpse of Elena , Fabian was brought back to Falsalfa 's jovially insistent insinuations about the columnist 's wife . He was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in any way , he was drawn to her nonetheless , and the source of that attraction was the visible force of the devotion she exhibited toward her husband . Peering around Francisco , Fabian continued to watch Elena ,  |p98in  splinters and shafts of movement , now swaying lightly in the saddle , her hair caught briefly by the occasional sun , one hand slack on the reins , the contour of a hip . The heat lulling about them , in fantasy he saw Elena de Tormes as one of the models in the adult sex entertainment centers commonlyfound in any large city . There would be booths , a girl to each booth , a booth to a customer , a man and a woman isolated on either side of a transparent glass partition that was immovable , and over the glass , a curtain that automatically rose for a brief interval each time the customer dropped a coin into a slot on the wall of the booth . The coin also set in motion a system , a grille of sound , through which the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation from each other , to perform a suggestive act , or he might ask that she initiate one . To keep the customer aroused , and the curtain up , and to sustain the current of coins , the girl would resort to various forms of provocative undress , posing , prompting him with language aimed at arousing him even more . In the booth containing the man and the woman , separated by the impregnable glass  --  the sight of each other and the exchange of their voices , the sole language of their contract  --  the woman , perhaps naked , might press her breasts against the cold surface , her nipples flattening , her flesh leaving a steamy blot , her tongue trailing a thread of moisture . The man , inflamed by her , by her voice and words , at the mercy of his own need , would continue to drop the coins , his passion congealing , locked away from the flame that had ignited it and from the source of release that summonedit . On this trackless path , the jungle their booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverie flowed over Fabian . He imagined how it might have been had he met her in the city , in the anonymity of a booth , Elena on one side of the glass , he on the other , two strangers trapped in their silent contemplation of each other . What would he tell her to do or ask of her , what might he want her to say to him , ask him to do ? What would he tell her about himself , about her ? Would ht , be coarse and carnal with her to the brink of abasement , and would he enjoy the spectacleof a charming , sensitive woman incited , driven to languagep99and action so lewd that they seemed to violate the mouth and body that offered them ? Would the presence of that glass partition urge him to excess or restraint ? The trees , motionless about them , were no longer a shelter from the jungle heat . The narrow path rose , twisting through hills of rock and clay ; the horses , hesitant and unsure , pawed the stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping , threatening to fall . Fabian realized that the horses , though Casa Bonita 's choicest , unsurpassed on the flat and open planes of the polo field or the predictable vistas of the stable grounds , were baffled at the unusuallyprecipitous terrain on which they found themselves . Yet he was anxious to reach the settlement at Cacata before the blaze of noon , and he had said as much to the forward guide , who was prodding his own horse to a swifter ascent . It soon became apparentthat Elena , though uncomfortable on a horse and apprehensiveat the hazards of the climb , was still in command of her mount , while Francisco was tiring rapidly , his legs dangling , his horse not properly mastered , bucking , fighting the bit in defiance . By now , the excursion had become an ordeal , the jungle closing about them like a tunnel , the staircase of rock they were ascendingjagged and lacerating , shelves of stone notched and gouged by time like petrified lava . Looking for a shelter where they could dismount and rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the head of the column . The guide 's horse had lost its footing , its hind legs foundering , veering to one side , as the man , reins still in hand , jumped clear , at an angle , stumbling into the bush , his curses invading the heat . The other horses panicked and dodged on the narrow precipice , rearing in desperation at the treacherous ground they could no longer trust . Fabian and Elena managed to remain in the saddle , hauling their mounts to steadiness , but Francisco , weakened by the punishing trail and the jungle heat , toppled out of his saddle , onto the sheer face of rock at their right , rolling onto the sharp knuckles of stone clawing at his shirt , gashing his arm . In fright , his horse heaved back into the brush , then , stung by the bristling foliage , charged forward , splaying out on tiie rocks . Fabian man/aged to catch its reins , noticing as he struggled to restrain the frantic animal that the fall had ripped a patch of skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly in the path , the horses sidling and bucking about them . Elena and Fabian bandaged Francisco 's wound , then , even though the journalist was shaken and tired , his clothes drenched with sweat , they were compelled to continue the climb . Without a place for them to bivouac , the laborious ascent continued for another two hours  --  an hour more than Fabian had thought it would take  --  before they broke out into the spaciousness of the plateau ; they took the last stretch toward Cacata in a loping canter . The region of Cacata was a wedge , a peninsula of level land carved out of the jungle , a wooded , dry shoal jutting thousands of feet above the river that snaked through the valley at its base . As the party approached one of the first settlements , the stir of the horses echoing in the silent lassitude of midday , hutches and shanties of clapboard opened on both sides of the road , and a pack of mangy dogs shot out to herald their arrival . The rutted , dusty strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , a swarm of children , naked and barefoot , abandoning the shelter of palm trees , joining the dogs in a squalling welcome . The village was routed from its siesta , as men and women of every age appeared in the shadow of the hutches , some naked or with only a knot of cloth around their bodies , a few crawling , a stray pig or goat nosing about the fringes of the commotion . The riders pulled up and dismounted at a shabby wooden barracks , an old trading post , now disused , that seemed to be the center of the village , serving for infrequent and vaguely official government sanitary missions . The guides hitched the horses , releasing the saddles , as Fabian and Elena settled Francisco on blankets outside the barracks . When the guides served the sandwiches and drinks they had brought , the huddle of villagers made a silent circle around the visitors , straining to see , intent on every flicker and move . Some of the younger , bolder men gathered in a knot to one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved closer to Francisco . Others , their interest riveted on weapons , surrounded the guides , posted warily against the wall of the barracks.  |p101Still  others hovered about the horses , marveling at their sleekness , height and the intricacy of their tack . To distract the attention of the crowd and to manifest a sense of ease and command in this strangeness , Fabian strolled leisurely around the village , a straggling cluster of watchful children in his wake . Passing a shamble of huts , he startled a woman with a baby on her arm ; before she retreated within , alarm for her own safety and that of her child broke through her impassive face . From behind a shutter , an emaciated old man smiled toothlessly . In the distance a group of young women closed in on a scampering pig , their naked breasts still shapely and firm , patches of bright cotton shielding their hips . Fabian had reached the edge of the village , the highest point of the plateau . He felt dizzy from the sun and the altitude ; the sheer drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy trough of yellow stirring , dissolving into the mossy green of land stretchingas far as he could see . He checked his watch : the helicopter had been scheduled to come for them shortly . He found himself straining for the sound of its engine , but the dome of sky was silent . He felt a twinge of anxiety . He began to realize how far inland they were , how remote from any town or village with police or a military outpost that could arrange their transportation to La Hispaniola . He returned to the barracks , where he found the crowd undiminished , still vigilant , still mute ; Elena was sleeping on a blanket , Francisco 's head in her lap . The afternoon was receding . The natives began slowly to drift away to their shanties ; only a few stray children and three or four young men still prowled around . The guides dozed in a stupor , guns cradled in their laps . Fabian sat down on a blanket and watched Elena . Her blouse , undone at the throat , revealed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black of her hair . The sun began to glide toward the crest of the palm trees ; the helicopter still had not come . Fabian became alarmed . He roused the others , pointing out to them that there were dozens of small settlements like the one they were in scattered thronghocnt thousands of square miles of jungle in the ( ; acata region and thatp102the pilot might have misunderstood the directions . The guides admitted that they had tracked their path to the village only by calculating the position of the sun in relation to the river . Fabian underscored the urgency of their situation while trying not to alarm Elena and Francisco . He pointed out that , in the casual atmosphere of Casa Bonita , their absence could easily go unnoticed for a day or two . And they had neither the stamina nor the resources to ride all the way back to La Hispaniola , a venture which would take days . He proposed that the guide who knew best the perilous way down to the river should go there , taking the horses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach in a day the military post that had dispatchedthe truck with their horses to the place of rendezvous . Then he would notify the authorities to summon a helicopter . Surly with reluctance but afraid to disobey Fabian , the man left the village for the descent to the river . The remaining guide began to prepare for the night . He selected the largest hut in the village and , without explanation , ordered the natives to evacuate it . They left , a procession of men , women and children , as well as a scrambling array of dogs , cats and pigs , driven to find other shelter for the night . While the guide started a fire outside to cook a meal , Fabian removed soiled mattresses and blankets from the bunks , leaving them in the yard for the night . In the evening stillness outside the hut , Fabian joined Elena and Francisco , watching the guide roast a small pig . From the bushes around the hut , the sudden rustle of a branch , a sneeze , a cough , laughter betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scrutiny of the visitors . During the meal , each time Francisco reached for a piece of meat , a spasm of pain from his fall contorted his face . The guide took a share of food but kept his distance , the submachine gun always at his shoulder . Occasionally he would glance with undisguisedhostility at Francisco , but toward Fabian , whom he knew to be a friend of El Benefactor , he maintained his usual servile manner . After the meal , the guide prepared a pungent fruit punch . He passed it around in pineapple husks . The punch was exhilarating ,  |p103and  Francisco , Elena and Fabian returned to it three or four times . It was not long before Fabian , exuberant with the punch and the intimacy of the night , told the guide to distribute what remained of the roast pig to the watching natives . The man called out , and soon a swarm of figures emerged from the darkness , stopping on the other side of the fire , hands burnished by the flame as they reached greedily for the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others moved into the circle of firelight , chanting and starting to dance , first as if in exhibition for their visitors , then with mounting intensity for themselves . At first the guide kept them at a distance , but when a few of the men approached him with a jug and gestured toward the visitors , indicating they wanted to return the gift of the meat with a fruit drink of their own making , he brought them over and whispered to Fabian that it would be unwise to refuse . Reluctantly , but caught up in the sensual flush , Fabian took a swig of the searing juice , then passed it on to Elena and Francisco ; they drank it under the watchful eye of the villagers . The dancing was now a rite , the fire a beacon against the sky . There were moments when Fabian felt vehemently alert to color and shape ; at other moments he lapsed into a stupor of sliding sensation . Once , he looked up into the mob and thought he saw Elena de Tormes swaying in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it toward her hips , taunting him to tear it off ; then he felt his body weightless , empty of feeling , cut loose , floating up from the ground toward her . Still later , he saw Francisco rushing at him with a machete , one that Fabian remembered the guide had used to split the roast pig . The machete gleamed as it split the table between them , Francisco 's voice a distant scream . Fabian 's head streamed with terror and exaltation . He reeled headlong toward de Tormes , but was snared suddenly by a figure he could not make out . He felt himself being carried inside the hut and placed there next to Elena . He dreamed that although she seemed to he sprawled on the dirt floor next to him , her blouse open , boots discarded , her riding breeches pulled down , she was really behind a glass parti/tion , lying next to another man ; Fabian , from his exile in this hut , was linked to her by thought only , his longing as translucent as the spill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tree uprooted , borne by an undertow , a spume of greedy mouth , a spindrift of venomous white froth , without respite . Elena was no longer far away , but moving beneath him , the stream that bore his vagrant tree , her mouth on his , their tongues folding , her hands prompting him to take her . He rose , leaning over her , taking her ; then with her astride him , he took her again . What he remembered at the last was a multitude of heads , nests and hives of faces he did not know , hovering over him , over Elena , intent on the two of them at love , as if witnessing the combat of insects locked in deadly embrace on the mud floor of the hut . Fabian awoke slowly , pain splitting his temples , piercing his eyeballs , his joints stiff . In panic , he looked around . He was lying on a bunk , daylight glinting through the thatched ceiling of grass above him , his naked body covered with a rough blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elena , still asleep , covered with a blanket . In the farthest corner of the hut , masked by shadow , he saw Francisco slumped on the floor . Fabian got up , stumbling as the bunk seemed to buckle under him and the roof skim low over his head . Shaking , he dressed himself and made his way out into the scalding sun . A group of natives , gesturing with animation , stood around the guide . At the sight of Fabian , they fell silent and broke ranks ; like a soldier on guard , the guide greeted him with a salute . A patch of barren clay opened before Fabian . At its center , he saw a spider , black-bodied , as large as his two hands with fingers outthrust , its hairy legs motionless , the gray belly mashed . The spider was dead , but so real in its poised menace that Fabian stepped back involuntarily . " This is the one which killed Senor de Tormes , " the guide said . In his stupor and revulsion Fabian assumed it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the guide 's face alarmed him . " Who killed what ? " he asked  | " A true tarantula , " the guide said , nudging the spider with the tip of his boot . " It bit Senor de Tormes when he went out and lay down on the ground . Senora Elena , when she found out he was dead , drank a whole bottle of this "  --  he gestured toward what was left of the natives ' punch  --  " so she would n't feel the pain . Retching as the acid liquid volleyed out of his throat , Fabian staggered back from the spider and ran into the hut . Francisco 's body was still huddled in the dark corner . Gliding with horror , Fabian knelt by the dead man and raised the blanket that shrouded him , trying to prop up the slipping shoulders , the head that bobbed to one side . He laid one hand along the dead man 's cheek . Francisco 's face was white , the sunburned glow of the day before already erased , the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mouth slightly agape as if in an expression of wonder . Fabian covered the body and crossed over to Elena . In her sleep she was serene . He stroked her hand ; she did not respond . Outside , he ordered the guide to store the dead tarantula for the police and to take down the names of the natives who , by the guide 's account , had witnessed the night 's events . Then , on an impulse , Fabian drew the guide to one side , away from the villagers . " Where were you when the tarantula bit Senor de Tormes ? " he asked . The guide hesitated . " I was  --  I was guarding you in the hut , " he said . " I helped to undress you and keep you down , Senor Fabian . You were  --  you were sleepy from the drink , " he blurted out . " Then I stayed with you so Senor de Tormes would not come at you again . " Fabian avoided his eyes : " I do n't remember anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Tormes want to hurt me ? " The guide smiled knowingly . " He was drunk , Senor Fabian , and he was jealous when he saw you touch his wife . He grabbed my machete and wanted to kill you . " Unable to challenge the man 's account , Fabian shifted his inquiry . " Who was the first to see Senor de Tormes dead ? " he asked  | " I was , " the guard replied . " I also told Senora Elena what happened . " He lowered his voice . " Senora Elena started to scream . She said things she should n't say , ugly things . " " What did she say ? " Fabian asked . The guide moved closer , until he was almost at Fabian 's ear . " She said that someone might have put this tarantula under Senor de Tormes . " " But who would want to do that ? " Fabian persisted . The guide nodded in confirmation . " That 's what I asked her . But she was drunk and kept saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " El Benefactor himself who was responsible . " He looked toward the hut sullenly . " She also accused me of it  --  of putting this tarantula under Senor de Tormes . " " Why you ? " " Because I work for El Benefactor . But you , Senor Fabian , you know that I could n't do it . " The guide was stressing each word , carving it as though with a machete . " You know best of all , because you must remember that I was with you , guarding you all the time . All the time , " he repeated . The roar of an approaching helicopter rushed in on them . The craft came in low over the trees and quivered to a halt in a storm of dust . Natives started to spill out of huts and bushes , running toward it , shouting with fascination and fear . The pilot stepped out , saw Fabian and explained tersely that he had had mechanicaltrouble the day before and had been unable to come for them after dark . He then joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives to carry the body of de Tormes and the sleeping Elena into the cabin . During the short flight to Casa Bonita , Elena did not wake up . Fabian got out , and the helicopter with Elena and the guide accompanying Francisco 's body continued on to the capital . At Casa Bonita , Fabian went directly to Falsalfa 's quarters . He impressed the secretary with the urgency of his visit and was promptly ushered into the library , where he found Falsalfa in a hammock . " I know about the accident . The pilot radioed us from Cacata , " Falsalfa announced calmly . " What a sad case , " 1w added , " de Tormes at the peak of his career , a yrnmg wife  --  all to end withp107the bite of a tarantula . " He continued to sway in the hammock . " De Tormes was murdered , Your Excellency , " Fabian said evenly . " A tarantula big enough to catch a chicken is not found in Cacata . It was the assassin 's best weapon . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had to be you , " Falsalfa said with emphasis . " Why me ? " Fabian asked boldly . Falsalfa had stopped swaying , but the smile remained . " You were the only one with a motive to kill him  --  Elena . " " That 's an ugly conjecture , Your Excellency , " Fabian replied . " That 's an ugly crime . " Falsalfa spoke with patience . " There are witnesses : practically the whole village saw you and Elena thrashing around on the floor , right under their eyes  --  and under the eyes of her drunken husband . " Fabian 's body went as hot with sweat as his voice was cold . " I do n't remember any of that , " he said . " We were all drunk  --  or drugged . " " Others do remember , " Falsalfa said . " When you and Elena became too obvious , Francisco almost killed you with a machete . It was the guide , a man in my service , sober fortunately , who disarmed him and saved your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut while Francisco raved outside . " Falsalfa paused for emphasis . " And it was during the night that poor de Tormes , so tired , so drunk , and so angry , sat down in the yard  --  right on a tarantula taking its midnight walk there . " " I 'm certain de Tormes was murdered , " said Fabian . The smile was no longer on Falsalfa 's lips . His hammock stopped swaying . " Would you like me to instruct my prosecutor to open a formal inquiry into the death of Francisco de Tormes ? " He spoke brutally . " To tell the public what took place between you and Elena in that village of Cacata ? Remember , Fabian , you are not in the United States . Here , what chance would you have for an acquittal ? " Falsalfa 's composure had returned . " The fact is , neither Francisco nor the tarantula can testify , but as for the guide , the villagers  --  show me one man or woman who would n't believe it was you who conveniently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabian stood silent as the hammock resumed its rhythm . He saw himself on a witness stand iii a eocintry whose language hep108barely spoke , many of whose customs were alien to him . In Los Lemures , where the whim of Falsalfa was the final court , a protracted trial would be his and Elena 's downfall . " What will happen to Senora de Tormes ? " he asked abruptly , the change in his thought reflected in his voice . Falsalfa recovered his smile . " Now , that is the concern of a reasonable man , " he sighed . " All you really care about is  --  Elena . " He considered the matter . " She is free to do whatever she pleases . But with Francisco gone , it will be a bit harder for her . Like him , she comes from a poor family , and all de Tormes left her are debts . " He brightened at a statesmanlike solution . " Why do n't you give Elena a call and invite her to Casa Bonita for a few days ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Better yet , Fabian , why do n't I ask my personal secretary to invite her in my name ? After all , Elena is the widow of my old friend , de Tormes , and the mistress of Fabian , my polo pal . What do you say ? " Fabian spoke in a voice harsh with rage . " I say , Your Excellency , that it is you who seized our trip to Cacata as the occasion to murder Francisco de Tormes . That 's why I intend to leave Los Lemures on the first plane , unless I , too , happen to be bitten by a tarantula before I get on that plane . " Falsalfa measured Fabian with absolute certainty . " You 're just a one-on-one amateur in whatever you do , Fabian . You will always be just an amateur . Nobody in Los Lemures would bother to waste a good tarantula on you ! " He gestured toward the door . The hammock was still swaying as Fabian walked out of the room . Years later , with Falsalfa no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a polo meet , with some of his friends playing on each side . The game passed with a few penalty shots , but otherwisewithout incident . That evening Eugene Stanhope had given a dinner party for Fabian at a local cabaret . It was crowded with tourists , and Fabian 's table , at the center of the room , was the largest and most boisterous , with a dozen of his friends and polo colleagues celebrating . Toward the end of dinner , the lights in the room dimmed . Waiters suddenly appeared , bearing aloft an enulx ) ssecl salverp109with a large ice-cream cake resting in a pool of brandy and studded with a coronet of gleaming sparklers instead of the usual birthday candles . They placed the elaborate tribute in front of Fabian , and just at the moment the headwaiter put a match to the brandy around the cake , a trio of nightclub minstrels began to serenade Fabian in thickly flavored English . His friends joined in , and tourists around the room picked up the chorus . In pleasureand surprise , Fabian rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flaming brandy slid down the front of his shirt over his jacket and trousers . He was on fire . People applauded wildly , under the impression that the flames and Fabian were part of the entertainment . His clothes ablaze , he plunged through the room , stumbling by tables of still-cheering patrons , toward a side door opening on a verandah above the gardens . He vaulted over its railing , into the lush foliage below , blindly rolling over and over on the dewy ground to put out the flames . When , dazed , he sat up , his white suit hung in charred strips , his chest and thighs showing through the scorched cloth . Fabian knew he had to do something about his burns at once . He went around to the back door of the cabaret to tell his friends that he was going home . A guard , looking at his disheveled state , took him for a drunk or vagrant , and rudely pushed him aside . Fabian then went to the main entrance , where couples in formal dress waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard shoved him away . Fabian 's pain was intensifying ; he slipped back through the gardens to the verandah and climbed onto it again , returning to the restaurant by the same door he had left . As he approached the table , Fabian met with a volley of greetings and laughter from his friends and people at nearby tables . Taking his appearance as a prank , they promptly opened a magnum of champagne . With faultless aim , they doused Fabian and his burns in the sparkling fountain . Only at the table did Fabian recall that the guard who had pushed him so rudely at the door was the same man who was once with him in Cacata , the one accused by Elena of murdering Francisco de Tonnes.  |p110In  times of calm , Fabian would yield to the ministry ofnature , never intrusive . It came to him in the spreading reach of a forest , the pine scent , the shallow scrub bristlingthe rim of a lake , the vanishing ruts of a dirt road . In times that were febrile and hectic , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensing to him music that would heal , a theater , pensive , compact with figures that could abort or compel his energy and thought , cinemas blinking their colors and images , the kindling of burlesque , the tease of a live sex show . In the city , Fabian inched his VanHome along the streets , scanning the sidewalks , alleys and benches for the figure of a woman alone . He could become as aroused by a lock of hair tucked behind a girl 's ear , a certain contour of her hip or leg , as he might be by the sound of her voice , by what she said or how she responded to something in him . She would be young , tall , slender , long-legged , with large eyes and thick hair , a wide mouth , conscious of the impact her body and her walk made on men . She had to acknowledge that he could offer no more than the union of the night , the courtship of a weekend or the intimacy ofp111a few evenings . A man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life was marked by abrupt change , by travel , Fabian could not permit himself to be detained too long by the solaces and distractions of a city or large town . He found himself selecting , isolating , soliciting partners as transient and avid as himself , as ready to initiate , as willing to discard . One evening in a bar , Fabian came upon a sometime acquaintance , a well-known television sports commentator , who occasionallyinvited him to appear on his program to discuss various polo and horsemanship tournaments . Stephen Gordon-Smith was in his early fifties , handsome , with that virility of voice , gesture and looks , that easy directness of manner that was the hallmark of his profession . The two men were settling down for a drink when Fabian suddenly caught a glimpse , in a far corner of the bar , of two young women he had met earlier in the year . Employed by a clothing manufacturer , they were models working out of New York . Fabian signaled them to come to the table and , when they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latin descent , in their early twenties , dark-haired , feminine and vivacious , with thick but well-drawn features and expressive eyes ; tall and slender , they were proud of their well-defined breasts , narrow waists , and firm buttocks . Gordon-Smith made no effort to conceal his pleasure with the girls , particularly Diana , the bolder of the two , who flirted with him more openly . Fabian noticed that his friend 's fascination with Diana was growing and when her companion got up to leave for an appointment , Fabian left too . Three or four weeks later , after an interview about the importance of the Eugene Stanhope Polo Tournament , Gordon-Smith took Fabian to dinner and freely confided that he had been seeing Diana almost constantly and that he was considering taking a leave of absence from the network  --  as well as from his wife  --  to be able to travel and live with Diana . Fabian , who knew how strict and conventional the major TV networks were in insisting that their most visible spokesmen  --  among whom Gordon-Smith had to be counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , was astonished by his friend 's decision . It seemed to him especially bizarre in light of the affectionate intimacy he had observed between Gordon-Smith and Emily , his wife of over twenty years , whom Fabian had met once when she and their two daughters accompaniedGordon-Smith to an intercollegiate polo championship at an Ivy League college during Fabian 's brief tenure there as polo coach . " How well do you know Diana ? " Fabian asked cautiously . " As well as a man ever knows a woman . " Gordon-Smith smiled expansively , with his easy air of male camaraderie . " Has she told you much about her life ? " " There is n't much to tell , " Gordon-Smith said . " Remember , she 's only twenty-four . " " What was her life like ? " Fabian maintained his casual tone . " Did n't she tell you ? " Gordon-Smith shrugged . He was not much interested in Diana 's past . " When I introduced you to her , " Fabian said , " there was no time to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or was it Nicaragua ?  --  just before one of those government unheavals they had down there . That 's when her family lost everything , and she emigrated here to live with an aunt , " Gordon-Smith explained patiently . " With a little private tutoring , she picked up the language , then worked in a couple of fancy beauty parlors . Then she did something in the fashion business , as a coordinator or , you know , a model  --  " He broke off , happy to change the subject , and reached eagerly for his briefcase . A file of glossy , neatly mounted fashion photographs slid before Fabian 's eyes . He saw Diana glowing up at him in color and in black and white . " Is n't she stunning ! " Gordon-Smith announced with elation , spreading out the photos . " She is , " Fabian said . " What a beautiful woman she has become . Gordon-Smith leaned across the table . " I 've had my share of women , but "  --  his voice dropped even lower  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her . " He laid a hand , commanding , on the photographs of Diana . " She understands you ? " Fabian suggested ,  | " Sexually  --  there 's nothing she does n't know about me . Nothing ! " He finished his drink and reached for another that the waiter had just put before him . " We 're so open with each other , so uninhibited . " Fabian shifted in his chair uneasily . " How long do you plan to stay with Diana ? " he asked . " Diana has made me realize what a conventional life I 've been living all along , " Gordon-Smith said forcefully . " I want to change it now . " He stopped , the glance he threw at Fabian a challenge and also a quest for reassurance . " Even if it means breaking away from my past . " " What about your family ? " Fabian asked . Gordon-Smith waved the question aside . " The girls are grown up , " he said . " As for Emily  --  " he hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . " " And the job ? " Gordon-Smith chafed under Fabian 's probing . " The job has nothing to do with my life  --  as long as I keep it private . " Fabian felt he should no longer withhold what he knew . " Diana is an extravagant character , " he volunteered . Gordon-Smith smiled indulgently . " She loves to go places , to travel . Last week she took me all the way to Miami so she could get a tan to show off , and I guess I 've been to about every disco there is . " Laughing , he raised his eyes and saw Fabian 's expression . " Is there something you know about Diana that you 're keeping from me , Fabian ? " he asked , suddenly sharp . " She 's a transsexual , a man , " Fabian said calmly . Gordon-Smith wrapped both his hands around Fabian 's wrists . " She 's what ? " he shouted hoarsely , the familiar resonance of his voice spilling round the restaurant . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a man who became a woman , " Fabian said . He kept his voice steady as he released his wrists from Gordon-Smith 's grip . Gordon-Smith had turned sallow . " You 're making that up , " he muttered sullenly . " You 've got to be . I know Diana . I 've had sex with her . I ought to know a woman when I 'm inside one . " " Diana was operated on some time ago , " Fabian said , " and the operation altered her appearance and her sexual organs . She can perform sexually as a woman . "  | " Why do you know what I do n't ? " " Where I met her , most of her friends did n't bother to hide what she was , " Fabian retorted , " and that 's a place I do n't think you 'd like to find yourself . " Gordon-Smith 's movements were slack , tired . He suddenly looked his age . " Why did n't you tell me this when you introduced me to her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would n't have been fair . When you met her , she had been a woman , psychologically as well as physically , for years  --  convincing to herself , to people like me and apparently to you . " " Then what makes you think it 's fair to tell me now ? " Fabian wished he could pinpoint his motive as accurately as he could strike a polo ball . " Perhaps it is n't . But most of those who enforce our sex laws run you down by snooping and denouncing , by informing on you . You 're linked to a woman who , under some of the vagrancy statutes in this country , could be arrested , fined , even jailed as a TV , a transvestite , though she 's not . I thought you should know that . " Gordon-Smith broke the long silence . " I can just see the headlines : TV Anchorman Anchored to a TV . ' " He thought for a moment . " Tell me , Fabian , " he questioned , " because I enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm queer ? " He asked the question with almost a professional detachment . Fabian looked at his friend across the table . " I doubt there 's ever been a judicial decision about what is meant by the conceptsmale ' and female , ' " he said gently . " When not even the law has defined the sexes , why should you ? " Some transsexuals  --  those men irreversibly altered into often beautiful women  --  knew the intimacy of Fabian 's VanHome : one eager to test on him her newly acquired womanhood ; one to reinforceher exaggerated femininity by offering to share it in lovemakingwith both Fabian and another man ; one testing herself by arranging to share Fabian in her encounter with a biological woman . Manuela was among them . Whenever Fabian saw her , beguiledby her beauty and his own reaction to it , lie experienced ap115sense of tumult , not unlike what he imagined Gordon-Smith must have felt when the truth about Diana 's life forced him to question his own . Manuela had come into Fabian 's life within the orbit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transsexual , who had already gone the road of full conversion and who asked Fabianto accompany her while she received her regular hormone injection . Introducing Manuela to Fabian , his friend told him that , unlike herself , Manuela was only a half-change ; her breasts enlarged by hormone treatment and surgery , the protruding Adam 's apple elided , skin depilated to smoothness . Yet , she was still unwilling or unready to undergo the final passage to full conversion . Manuela blushed , stammered her name and , shifting uneasily , silently permitted Fabian 's assessment of her sensual face and smooth neck , girlish breasts , and a waist , hips and legs of consummate shapeliness . She was in her mid-twenties and worked in a large pharmacy owned by her father and mother . Since adolescence , she had lived as a female , an arrangement to which her parents consented ; it was for her sake , to preserve her secret , that they moved to another city , where Manuela would be known only as a young woman . There were long intervals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tormented her , its maleness a fraud ; then she considered the prospect of total surgical conversion . Yet , though she existed as a woman and desired sexual relationssolely with heterosexual men , Manuela insisted that only by retaining her male organ would she be able to experience desire and orgasm . She felt that most of the fully converted transsexuals she knew suffered weakened sex drives ; seldom , if ever , able to achieve orgasm , they became sexually dormant . Manuela told Fabian how , with a man who , not aware of her duality , was captivated by her as a woman or who captivated her , she was compelled to maintain a maze of deceptions and theatrical ingenuities to conceal her true identity . With the help of adhesives and tapes , even with corsets , she constricted her organ , folding and pressing it tightly against her body ; during lovemaking , the affirmation of her femininity and beauty , she invented elaborate strategies and rases , menstrual cramps as an instance , to prevent herself from having to undress fully beforep116her partner ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she might offer him her breasts , her mouth , any other mode of love , so that he would be led to think he had possessed her entirely . She admitted that such exchanges were exciting , flattering , and reinforced her sense of herself as female but she also acknowledgedthat , sexually , they often left her unfulfilled , feverish with barren stimulation . Manuela 's predicament rang true to Fabian in mirroring the ambivalence he recognized in any relationship , however brief , that he entered into with a transsexual woman . He vacillated between having a lover who had undergone the final transformation , though at the cost of diminished desire , or having one who , like Manuela , retained the force of desire , at the price of forgoing the reality of the other gender she desperately lay claim to . Fabian probed his fascination with Manuela . What seemed to him its source was a fuse and musk of charged femininity : her features and the shape of her body , her voice , her makeup and dress  --  all her being strove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riveted by a youthful sensuality , always flagrant , in alliancewith an expression of that sensuality , always studied  --  femininityon the make . Hinting at a revelation of what was vulnerableand soft in him , Manuela promised a discovery of sensation that was unexposed , untapped and all the more ripe for exploration . But at no time did her assumed womanhood , the authority of her femininity , obscure for him the physical fact of her maleness , and at no time did he find her duality troubling . In his VanHome , in a private chamber of his private fort , he was free to pursue , to assess and to meditate on the enigma of his own being  --  an outlaw from the league of crusaders , inquisitors and censors of sexual conduct . On his way to the city , Fabian would call Manuela , and she would arrange to take time off from the pharmacy . When he arrived , he would leave his VanHome close to a park ; the next day , Manuela , who enjoyed riding , would join him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight case , she would visit him . Her appearance in the VanHome 's narrow doorway was always an event : a rustle and slip of grace , accomplished and knowing , like a ballerina entering from the wings or a model poised at ap117fashion show . It became their habit , before going up to the alcove , to linger over drinks in the VanHome 's living room . Manuelawas unquiet , even fretful during those interludes , wanderingabout as they spoke , flipping through one of the horse and rider magazines on his bookshelves , then discarding it . Occasionally , the brass fixtures in the room or the mirror on the wall would give her back her reflection : instantly , one hand would rise to the arrangement of her hair ; she would examine her makeup , adjust the flow of the blouse draping her neck and shoulders . She alwayswanted to impress Fabian with the progress she had made as a woman , the perfecting of her beauty and femininity . Her presence was a ferment in the room : a sultry spirit , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosened knot of her lush hair , her shoulders and hips seething beneath her clothes . Outside , all was still , the city , the trees , his VanHome abolished in the tide of darkness . At its farthest fringe , a thread of burning orange , the lights of the city , held the park in its taut noose . Soon Fabian would ask Manuela to go with him to the alcove . She would get up and prepare another drink , reassure herself for the last time in the mirror , and take the lead , Behind her on the stairs , watching the faultless line of her leg , the polished curving of a hip ascending before him , he would grasp in himself , once again , the inescapable knot of his need , the raveled mesh of what it was that he wanted from her . In the alcove , Manuela would sit on the bed 's edge , preening her legs , monitoring his scrutiny of their uncommon length in proportion to her rib cage . She would unleash her thick hair , to fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , some recognitionin the circuit of his thought would affirm that hair , like skin or tooth or nail , knew no sex ; it lent its beauty of texture , shape and color to female and male equally . Now , as in the past , she would prolong this phase of their meeting , making the beauty of her face accessible , obedient iii her will to please him , while the rest of her would remain concealedwithin her clothes , teasing , insinuating , conscious that he could not know whether the excitement that grew on her face was matched by her body 's own response. f le could have her , he would tell himself , in this fashion , on terms that were arranged , by her , to satisfy and to please him  --   |p118a  man , one of those beings from whom she now saw herself estranged by her femininity , the spirit of her own world . He was aware that for her to offer him more of herself , to lay open to him her entire body , would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would make her betray what in herself she loved most . Yet if he was aroused by her beauty , the texture , shape and fragrance of her womanhood , it was because he longed for a signal that she wanted to be taken , to give herself to him , and finally , no longer passive , spurred by his excitement , she wanted to take him . Consciously , then , he would make known his yearning for that stirring in her , a signal that the narrow slip of cloth , now a mere leaf against the promise of her body , was the only frontier that separated her from him , the tape binding her flesh , the last prison of her being . She would respond with a request that he dim the lights in the alcove , denying the mirror there the power to bear witness to her nakedness , and , hesitantly , she would remove the narrow band of cloth and peel off the tape . She was naked beforeFabian now , but still reluctant to permit herself to become aroused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that image of herself that , even though she was naked , impelled her to keep herselfclothed , hidden from herself . She still refused to let even her hand , the hand of the woman , scout the realm of what was man in her , still feared that the wakening of her own excitement would banish the woman in her . Instead , she volunteered to enhanceFabian 's pleasure with her touch , to post herself in sensuousmediation between him and his own desire , even as she still declined to obtain it from her own flesh . Slowly , in her contemplation of Fabian and of his pleasure in being with her , Manuela succumbed to a realization that if he was not threatened by the form and shape of her pleasure , it need not pose a barrier to her . She came to see that she was , in her need of feeling and of arousal , no less a woman than , in his answering need , he was a man ; that , by reaching with him the shores that confined the body 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , consolidate her reality . In this joint traffic of pleasure , a cycle of what was given , whatp119taken , Fabian 's passion her only guide , Manuela would rise to the satiety of her own pleasure . Fabian was made conscious of possessingher , was free to stake claim to her body , free to impel her to her own revelation . He hovered over her , in awe of a body that had no fault , that seemed to incarnate the secret of who he was : at her mouth and breast , he was a boy necking with a girl ; entwined with her , entering her , he was a man taking his woman ; arousing her with his hand , he was a boy at play with a man ; straddling her as she lay helpless beneath him , he was a man toyingwith a boy ; inert , pinioned by her , he was a man at the mercy of a boy . Now they lay together , the shudder of flesh waking them to its meaning , desire a fluent stream between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither lost to the pleasure of the other , they seemed two instruments shaped from one mold , to one end , each an embodiment of the other 's quest . Just as Manuela was no longer the contrivance of their first encounter , an icon of cosmetics and dress , of shapes and gestures , so Fabian , submissive to his own desire , ceased to be a tissue of his memory , of circumstance and the moment 's decor . Dancers passing beyond the dance , music abandoned , movement and the stage obliterated , the two of them were now equally lovers , a habitat of flesh , bound to the revelation of that flesh through each other , assenting to its mercy . Afterward , Manuela would slip quickly from the bed and disappear into the bathroom . When she returned , moist and cool from the bath , her hair combed , her face freshly made up , her nightdress wrapping her body in a mist of gauze , she would ask Fabian to turn on all the lights and then sit beside him , gently guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them twins of contemplation . He would watch her adoration of her reflected self , as if she were a man discreetly admiring a young girl , her eyes pausing on her face , brushing her mouth , descending to fondle her breasts , glide over her belly , avoiding the slight blur of the narrow slip of cloth , then slide along her legs , returning once more to her face , once more to her breasts . The canvas of her eyes readily prompted her hands to a new life ; aroused again , her eyes caught at the mirror , she would reach out to Fabian ,  |p120stroking  his flesh . But when he sought to interrupt that rumination , to bring her mouth back to his , she would succumb to him reluctantly , unwilling to abandon the mirror 's seduction . When bantering , he would ask her what was it that she saw ; she would turn to him with a smile so artless that it restored him to the memory of the moment when he first surprised her in her engagement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had fallen in love with the beautiful woman in the mirror , a love , she went on dreamily , in which she was not alone . How could it be , she asked , that the woman arrested in the mirror , so sensuous and so complete , the woman now returning their gaze , should not be the object of their love , an artifact of their own devising , the murmur of her reflection rising from herself to enfold him , then passing on to something beyond the rapture of their dual fascination . On occasion , Fabian would invite into his VanHome a new companion , one of the girls or young women whom he had met at a recent horse show and who was now to be alone with him for the first time . Earlier he would have arranged for Manuela to join them , and when she arrived , the flare of her seductive allure would be in full glow , the meld of her sexuality fired by the challengeof another woman . She would wait while Fabian took the girl on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tack room , in the stalls next to the horses , those animals for whom the girl had professed her tenderness and devotion when she had first met him , Fabian had a chance to put her at ease , to establish between the two of them their shared love for horses . He would walk next to her through the narrow spaces , then let her take the lead , his shoulder or hip brushing hers as they navigated , sniffing the scent of leather drifting about the tack room , listening to the rustle of horses nuzzling alfalfa in the stalls . Back in the living room , busying himself with drinks and food , he would ask Manuela to show their guest his sleeping alcove and the bath . When they came back some while later , flushed with laughter , their glasses empty , he would observe , with some complacency , that the girl was already far more familiar with Manuela than with him . He would watch covertly how Nlauuelap121planted in their guest the conviction that , for their evening togetherto be transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chase , they must abandon themselves to the world much as they would to the wayward impulses of a horse on track or trail ; for the three of them , the two women and Fabian , their friendship was now the stuff of that world , the swift laying hold of the moment , their private hunt . Later , in a sensuous lull of the evening , when the initial reserves , defenses and barriers had been breached , the girl would confess to Manuela that , if she were ever to be intimate with another woman , beauty of face and promise of personality having exerted their magnetism , the breasts of that other woman would be the most alluring element . Avid to test her prowess still further , Manuela would now find a pretext to reveal the contours of her breasts , enticing under her thin blouse , the nonchalance of her movements masking the guile of the act . Fabian would then leave the two of them in the room , withdraw to the alcove , change into a robe and wait . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dress , Manuela would bring their guest to the alcove ; absorbed in Manuela , the girl would barely notice that Fabian was wearingonly a robe . The two women would proceed to mull over each other in the mirror , applying eye shadow , blusher , lip gloss , putting up their hair only to let it tumble in disarray over their shoulders , sharing that liberty of touch of those who share a common purpose . Manuela 's mood would change . AcknowledgingFabian 's presence with her eyes , she would become more openly seductive , permitting herself to fondle and kiss the girl , first on the cheek and then the neck ; then , while dabbing perfumeon the girl 's temples , she would lean forward and kiss her lips , the movement fleeting still , the intent disguised . Manuela might then suggest that , to enhance her freshly made-up face and to transform her appearance even more dramatically , the girl ought to try on some of the clothes Manuela had brought with her . Intoxicated by the spirit of the exchange , mesmerized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact she might have , the girl would assent greedily . Watching from the bed , Fabian still retained his post of detachment . Heedless of her own nudity , the girl was preoccupiedp122only with Manuela 's hands that slipped about her , undressing and dressing again , no longer stealthy in their search , brushing her nipples , skimming over her thighs , brief but insistent in their return , hesitant no more at her mound of flesh . Extravagant in her adulation of the girl , Manuela would murmurin tribute to the subtleties of beauty enhanced by the new makeup , the teasing fantasy of the antique Victorian gown , its waist cinched , its ribbons and laces dangling in pretty disorder . She would embrace the girl , as if solicited only by the artifice of the paint and dress before her , and then , even more abruptly , kiss her on the mouth , the caprice of her own theatricality a license for the bluntness of the need . Manuela 's spell was now complete . Unmoored from the bonds of time outside the alcove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all three of them , the girl was free to interpret the events in the alcove as moments without reference to an external world of cause and consequence , a dream gatheringpassion unto itself , a destiny plundered . She , who had never been aroused by a woman before , was aroused by Manuela , althoughshe glanced constantly at Fabian to reassure herself that he was part of what was taking place . The girl still allowed Manuela the freedom to undress her , but when Manuela helped her to emerge from the gown , the fantasy of lace and satin and velvet , it was now the girl who would reach out to her . Manuela disrobed and , masked only by the narrow strip of cloth that trapped her hips , lowered herself onto the bed , bringing the girl with her , the two of them kissing and caressing as they fondled each other , makeup smudging their cheeks , hands and shoulders . Thrashing in their union , the girl would thrust her breasts against Manuela 's , her mouth searching the mouth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the brink of descent , threatening to move down , to tear at the narrow strip of cloth that still estranged Manuela from her . Then Fabian would place himself between Manuela and the girl , claiming the girl for himself , offering himself to her . Manuela would recede in response , her body dissolving from the space between the man and the girl , only her face an intermittent invader of the seal of their kiss , the third party in the triptych of their embrace . The girl , now as abandoned with Fabian as she had Iwen with Man/uela , finally gave herself up to her own sensation and ambivalent quest to touch and taste the flesh of either , avid to rcceire the badge of her adventure . The contagion of her need prompted Fabian to probe her deeper , with more force , while Mannela wedged in between them , offering her mouth to kiss and to be kissed , eager to know that the girl loved her as a woman and that the presence of Fabian  --  of any man  --  could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity play about Manuela and the girl . Retreating , he wondered whether Manuela 's need to be a woman could remain more urgent than the need for fulfillment that would compel her to take off the narrow strip of cloth and reveal herself ; whether she might choose to turn to Fabian for still another homage to her feminine power , now that he had seen her triumph in so exacting an arena of accomplishments ; or whether she might reach her fulfillment later , alone , beguiled by the memory of herself with the girl , one woman loving another . He also wondered whether , with Manuela naked and aroused , the girl 's passion would prevail over the sudden mutation , in an image more ideal , more persuasive , more complete in its power to please than the one that Manuela offered ; whether the girl could accept , as easily as he did , this mode of loving for what it was , a quest for beauty , for its expression , in whatever form or image or manifestation of touch , a love no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appreciative eye of a horseman for a stallion , a mare or a gelding . With his legs thrust wide , Fabian would sprawl on his back , then slowly pull the girl onto him , her body a firm blanket coveringhim , her back against his chest , her head , the face upturned , tucked between his neck and shoulder , his knees and calves bracing her legs , urging her wide , fastening her to himself , her buttocks straddling him , his flesh planted , settling deeper in her , his hands snaring her wrists , binding her more tightly to him , then scooping her arms wide , lapping her breasts outward , her belly flat , her thighs forked , tempting Manuela with the locked and coiling rhythm of their bodies . From behind the girl 's head he could not see Manuela crouched at their feet , but within the instant , he felt the warmth of her touch on his flesh . A shiver ran through the length of the girl 's body ; lying , still bound to her ,  |p124he  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , as she let herself be opened to the touch of the other woman while remaining open to his . Straining as he thrust into the girl , he waited for Manuela to respond ; then , as he heard the girl 's moan , felt her taut above him , he was aware of Manuela 's weight upon them , a man enteringthe girl from above , just as he had entered her , as if she were a boy , from below . Now all was tightness and tension within the girl 's body , a substance thrashing between him and Manuela , aware no longer , caring no more who it was that brought her the sensation she could barely contain . Fabian began to chart his own sensations . The girl had ceased to be a space sundering him from Manuela ; he felt Manuela as a tide within his own flesh , he within hers , the girl only a veil or tissue uniting them , yielding to their common pulse and surge , an agent of communion , avid to transmit sensation from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself knew in the receiving and the recording . Fabian 's thoughts drowned in the onslaught of pleasure . Lost on a periphery of knowledge , he let himself vault into the midst and flight of his dream , the scope of his fantasy the vastness of a polo field , the grass fragrant and dewy , a blue dome of sky , the morning heat a rising mist , he on a horse , mallet in hand , the ball ahead . In the seduction of a perfect shot , charging at the gallop , his legs prompting and gripping , he was set on the ball , his thigh against the saddle , his weight gathered in his foot , digging into the stirrup , his toes clawing ; then , bending his body forward , his eye and thought strained to the target , he swung his mallet , striking faultlessly the center of the ball . A crest of feeling broke above him , elation at his feat . Just then the straps that fastened his saddle to the horse tore under his weight . Instantly his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As his pony veered off , he pitched , then , plunging dreamily , free at last from the reins , the dew splashing him like cold sweat , he rolled through the grass , yielding to this jet and spume that seemed to rise not from the grass but from his being , making him one with his own flesh.  |p125Neither  polo nor ponies were fashioned for the stony wastesof high plains without horizon , the thin air , the snowdrifting in thick billows of silence . And so Fabian always made for the hot , marshy lowlands , steering his VanHome to gentle ground where he and his ponies could wander at will , play , take their pleasure without rein . He shunned the featurelesslure of the sleek turnpike and expressway , the heedless thruway , preferring the fellowship of the backwoods spilling before him , the intimacy and promise of the rural bypath , narrow , alert with surprise . On warm nights , his VanHome parked deep in some wood , he might sleep wrapped in a blanket in the moist grass under a bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack of grain or hay . Ile would listen to the whiffs of wind , trees in their rustling , the swift rush of birds . When the last echo subsided and life hung suspended , the night air would flicker with sound , distant , sharp , close : a stranger , uncertain , timorous , sidling by his VanHome ; lovers whispering in search of a retreat ; a dog tracking the pungentsmell of lig Lick and Gaited Amble ; the meowing of a stray cat . In that solitude , Fabian did not envy other people theirp126thronged existence . They appeared to him , most of them , to have consented to the manufacture of their lives at some commonmint , each day struck from the master mold , without change , a duplicate of what had gone before and was yet to come . Only some accident could bring to pass upheaval in the unchallenged round of their lives . It was not contempt he felt for them , merely regret that they had allowed the die of life to be cast so early and so finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He reasoned that , if in the course of his adult life , he chanced upon no more than perhaps twenty or twenty-five men and women , each of whom mattered to him as friend or lover , he would still be faithful to his calling . If this was true for him as a polo player , ever on the move , it would have been no less true for him as a lawyer , businessman , artist or politician . For Fabian , nature offered a spectacle absolute in scope . In his parade of admiration for it , the barter of his wandering , he seemed to himself an explorer in quest of a vantage point from which he could more fairly contemplate himself . He would leave his VanHome in a wood or field and ride his ponies in tandem , catapulting in play from one to the other , companionedby a wind that tossed bits of grain in his face and mouth or whipped him across desolate reaches of stubble . He might trot Big Lick or Gaited Amble under the slender trees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses through the supple grasses of Wyoming or over Utah flats blazing in a shower . Sometimes , as he cantered through dry moss in Arizona or Nevada , the skeleton of some old mining town , a relic of boomand-bust , would loom in the ghostly space before him . A church spire pierced the unanswering sky ; the shells of long-deserted houses lay about him . Far away , a coyote howled , its long sour moan pricking Fabian 's ponies to prance uneasily . Enthralled by so measureless a domain , he would race his horses at the rim of the desert , stampeding the whitish gardens of borax , vaulting the silver furrows that slit the salt fields , refreshing his steaming ponies in the tepid green of the pupfish marshes , stalking the hollow cages of sagebrush scudding over the broken mud flats . Here , in this burning void , this landscape of heat and lightp127and space as pure and luminous as a cube of metal or a shard of mineral so crystalline that no pool of rain water could impose on it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . Without him to see it , the natural world would remain unseen , unknown , a thing unto itself , radiance in a galaxy strewn with distant light . The shelves on the walls of his compact living area were densely packed with books . When in his voyaging he came upon a large bookshop , a rare occasion in the country , rarer than some of the wildlife he encountered  --  whose survival was protected by law  --  he would browse among the counters and shelves for hours . He had to be discriminating : in his VanHome , space was tight , and to make room for a new book , he would have to relinquishone he already had , dropping it off at a community library along his way . What survived his scrutiny in the bookshop , the books he took back with him to his VanHome , promised a landscape his imaginationhad not yet explored and could not scan in advance . When he was in pain  --  bruised , or suffering the wounds of a rough game , apprehensive and restless , reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those books that he would turn , and always a novel . A private trailer for his mind , that novel would take him where his VanHome could not , permittinghim travels to a reality outside the dominion of nature , a fusion of what the present was becoming with a history of what the past might have been , a weightless passing through time and place and thought , coasting with a freedom unmatched by any spaceship . At any point in such a voyage , Fabian would find himself no longer the solitary passenger of his VanHome , but a fugitive from an exhausted view of himself , a displaced person in an uncharted landscape , an emigre to the frontier beyond the scope of his transit . Fabian shared with many Americans of his generation a dual past . The years of his childhood and youth had been spent in the stony , rural life of one of those marginal " old countries , "  |p128their  borders and boundaries forgotten now , during a decade of wars , of political and social upheavals that ravaged them every so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him up in a small village was blessed , or burdened , with too many children of his own ; but , encouraged by the local priest to placate a not easily placated God , he took in Fabian , a refugee from the city where , for the time of yet another war , his parents chose to remain without him . The farmer had the grudging hope , the expectation , that the boy 's advent would be the forerunner of more tangible gifts of favor and grace . When it was not , the farmer decided to make use of him , even though he was still a boy , as a farmhand , and the days of his childhood were spent in tending to horses , pigs , goats and poultry . The horse was an inescapable presence in Fabian 's early life , as inevitable and taken for granted as the car would become in the years of his maturity . In the village , horses were used to pull plows , as well as to haul carts and carriages ; they were treated no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their labor long and exhausting , their time at pasture brief . The whip was used to speed them up ; at the first sign of illness , they were killed for meat . As an outsider , Fabian was often sport for bands of other children , first in play , occasionally in fight , when they would turn on him in the bond and unity of their family kinship . It was duringone of these games , threatening at any moment to erupt into combat , that , for the first time , Fabian found himself riding bareback . A volatile stallion , taunted by a sheepdog lunging and snappingat it , thrashed about its enclosure , heaving against the bars , on the verge of breaking out . Fabian was tending a flock of geese when a group of boys seized him from behind , pinioning his arms , and heaved him onto the stallion 's back . Caught off guard by the sudden ballast , the stallion halted ; instinctively , in the moment before the horse reared , Fabian grabbed its mane . His legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting desperately to keep from sliding off . The clog renewed its attack , and the stallion broke its bounds , kicking the gate aslant , pickingp129up speed as it shot toward the open field , leaving the snapping , hapless dog and the raucous boys far behind . Freed from the restrictions of its pen , the stallion bolted into frantic , unchecked flight , crossing a wide , pitted road in one leap , dashing into the hedges , its hoofs spraying the soft , sandy loam , the sharp branches of a cedar flogging Fabian 's legs as the animal plunged through it heedlessly . In a quiver of time swift as light , Fabian saw a fly attached to the horse 's neck , perched just behind one ear , persisting , undisturbed by the pounding of the huge , sweaty mass that was ferrying it through the brush . He knew that , like the fly , his hope depended on clinging fast to the horse 's neck , that if he were to fall , he would be pitched onto the ground with a force that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands tangling in the stallion 's mane , centering his chest and stomach to cradle in the niche of its back , no choice open to him other than to yield to the motion of the animal . And there he remained , the horse 's head a shield against the branches as he moved through time , calm as the fly . The barn that quartered horses had also been the pen of much of Fabian 's boyhood . It was a lair of intimacy he often shared with them , and the scene of his initiation into the lore of sex and birth long before he could decipher the world around him , the world of men and women , girls and other boys . A horse bristled and shook off another , bit and kicked at it in retaliation when nudged , tried to ignore it . Then the horse changed , became so gentle that Fabian at first worried that it was sick . But then , when it nuzzled and nudged the other horse , the sight stirred Fabian . It was a mare rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrating to the stallion 's breath and pulse , prickling when he snorted , alert to his every move , yet she stood passive , primed for the assault of all his weight . The stallion , too , was changed , his sex engorged , his moods seesawing between playfulness and violence ; sometimes he mounted the mare as if determined to pierce her entrails , to wound her before she could escape his dominion . Yet what appeared to the boy a tide of violence , the mare 's snl-n-ission first to her own heat , then to the assault of the stallion , did not seem a breach in the evele of nature . From the moment of their coupling , naturep130hoarded the time needed for new life to emerge from the moist enigma of the mare 's insides . The door of the stable , like one sovereign arm of an invisible clock , opened to admit the flush of summer and the chaff and thistle of fall , closed to shut out the onslaught of snow , opened again to acknowledge the moist scent of spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumped , restless , then lurched , uncertainwhether it should trust its belly or legs for support , panic in its eyes and movements . Soon it lay down , reluctant , even unable , to get up again . A massive shudder ran through its body , and swiftly , between the mare 's raised hind legs , the narrow muzzle of a foal appeared , its two forelegs a frame in a heaving sac of glistening filament , pliant , almost translucent . Fabian had been ordered to tear the sac if it had not broken open while moving through the mare , and he touched the mysteriousfiber in awe at this envelope that delivered new life . But the sac had already been split by the pelvis , and he saw the foal 's legs protruding without obstruction , ready for further delivery . The mare , exhausted , waited to muster more strength ; the foal , most of it still huddled inside the sphere that had formed it , attempted to move on its own , already another presence in the world that would soon claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . As if responding to his gaze , the foal , prodded by the mare , pushed itself forward , sloughing off the rest of the sac , eager to leave the home that was not large enough for it anymore , even though , once it was outside the mare , the foal was still bound to it by the umbilical cord , a pulse of blood . Fabian waited a few minutes , carefully guiding the foal away from the heaving body of the mare , then , even though he was fearful that he might be cutting a source of life , he severed the umbilical cord boldly . The foal was on its own now . Trembling to its feet within minutes , shaking but steady enough to keep its balance , it staggered about , oblivious of Fabian ; confused , the foal broke into its first walk around the mare , then , exhausted , lay quietly at its side , waiting . In the morning , Fabian would rim to his master 's house to bring the news of the new life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foal surprised by its first sleep outside the womb , Fabian would lie in the straw , ponderingthe birth he had just witnessed . With a rush of envy and apprehension , he thought about the place that the foal had so heedlessly abandoned in the mare , its stall of warmth and safety , now bartered for the hazard of whip . He warmed at the thought of the mare and how he would have liked to nest inside it , alone there , well fed , its flanks his walls , its withers and croup his roof , its legs absorbing the shock of uneventerrain , and how he would be free to peek out at the hostile world merely by lifting the mare 's tail , a curtain he might raise or lower on an uncertain stage . It was then , when still a boy , that Fabian saw a horse die . The animal might have been grazing at pasture or hauling a plow or even resting in the barn . He remembered how , stirring to a portent of menace that seemed an alien odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erect , its eyes hurtling to and fro , desperate to locate the lurking terror . Unable to make out its enemy , to move swiftly from the threat , powerless to flee its sense of foreboding , confused , the animal faltered in a spasm of panic and pain , betrayed by its own body , its breathing easy no more , its heartbeat , once so measured , broken now , erratic . It heaved its head about , instinctively searching out the presence of a herd , for others like itself , who , in this last moment of life , would offer a confirmation of continuingexistence , copious and teeming . But there was no herd within its field of vision , no others to offer support , to draw sustenance from . Dread fusing with pain , the animal for whom earth had been a field over which to range and race , found that it could move no more , its muscles , tendons , ligaments withered , refusing to answer the summons of life that still nettled in its brain . It nodded instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature 's last . Fabian watched as the great bridge of the horse buckled , the useless pillars of its legs slipped sideways , the boom of its neck twisted , the head , an empty bucket , pitching clown . In a moment , the horse 's power to breathe and to run , the license to continue in life , had been snatched from it , a merciless aboIishotent as anrbit-:uv as tilt ' generosity With 5511X ' 11 life hadp132been offered once to that newborn foal quivering under Fabian 's eyes . Now he saw that the body , which only a little while before had commanded the earth with matchless speed and endurance , was a heap of bone and meat , wrapped still and again , as at the beginning , in a steaming sac of skin . In life , the horse had always appeared to Fabian fleet and airborne , almost weightless as it skimmed the ground , gracefully springing back from the surface with the ricochet of its hoofs . Now , in death , it lay slack , the plane of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged at the end of a thick chain by a sluggish ox , the horse 's legs floundering each time its body passed over a freshly plowed furrow . It was often Fabian 's task to gut the dead horse . In the barn , an ax handy , his knives sharpened on a whetstone , he would start by cutting open the main arteries , letting the blood from the severed vessels drip into a heap of desiccated hay . He then opened the base of the stomach , its entrails still hot , and started to disembowel the horse , piece by piece , organ after organ , mindful not to discard the edible delicacies of liver , heart , kidneysand tripe , or to soil them with the noxious colon and bloated cecum ; unlike the rabbits , sheep and pigs he had often gutted , a horse had no gall bladder that , when carelessly cut , would spill its bile . He would then dump the offal and carrion into a corroded barrel and roll it down a small hill toward a pit he had dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crows , dogs and rats . If the work did not sicken him , the poring over the spongy mass , his hands and clothes bloodied , the mingled smells of blood , excrement and half-digested food , it was because he would always think of the supple grace and fluent perfection of the horse in motion , its muscles surging to pull a cart , flexing in a walk , stretching and thrusting at a gallop . The flesh was gone now , the choicest hunks of meat hacked out by the farmer and stored in the icy pits under the main house . Only the skeleton remained before Fabian , its bones soon to be smashed and scattered at the edge of the forest , far from the pasture and fields that had been the horse 's domain . Abovep133all other abandoned , useless and decaying parts of the dead horse 's body , the skeleton bothered Fabian most . Unlike the animal 's skin or blood , the intestines , lungs , nerves or muscles , each a forge of moisture and heat , a furnace of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones that Fabian had once counted , seemed no more complex than the crude pillars , posts , joints and frames that made up the barn  --  and no more mysterious . If the skeleton was the bony soul , the hardened essence of the horse , it appeared , when juxtaposed with the living mass of the animal , rather as its opposite , a caricature supplanting pliancy with rigor , fluency with brittleness , motion with stillness . What would have happened to the horse , Fabian wondered , if , throughoutits life , instead of relying on its instinct , the animal had sought support only from its skeleton ? Later in life , domesticated in his VanHome , Fabian would pass at random across the border of California and Nevada , stopping , when the impulse took him , at Dante 's View , a point of observationfrom which his gaze could sweep out over the panorama of 1 ? oath Valley , a shallow , arid basin of rocks and flats , the floor of the continent he traveled incessantly , that rose at its farthest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grizzled slopes until it came to rest on the peak needling the sky . Posted above that parched and hazy sheet of Death Valley , he would marvel at the tolerance of nature , its indifferent generositythat permitted springs and streams , a lake and swamp , fish and other creatures native only to this measureless vacancy , in the midst of heat sometimes unmatched by any other on earth . Having left his VanIIome miles away in the safety of a motel parking lot , he would descend into the valley , then take refuge on an islet in a sudden grove , an oasis of surprise , bending , marshy rushes fringing the edge of its trickling stream . There he would lie down , the sad . ' heat kneading his back , Big Lick and Gaited Amble nuzzling hin- or heaving to rest at his side , the shield of his eyes a screen for dreams and thought , the film ofp134his imagining broken only by a need as rude as thirst or hunger . In the ceaseless rhythm of the stream , the darting flicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heron , the brooding of his horses at the shallow dunes , Fabian saw his solitude and his flight beyond the boundaries of time known and time yet to be forayed , testament to his joy and his lamentation , harbingers of a voyage whose destination he could not ever know . It was here , riding one day , that Fabian saw , far away on the flats , a herd of wild horses , their spotted hides a camouflage , their run kicking a screen of dust against the darkened hills and mountains . He started to follow the herd , prompting Gaited Amble into a smooth gallop , and when she began to pant , spent with heat , he vaulted easily to Big Lick , the horses ' gait unbroken . Soon he was close enough to make out the wild mustangs cantering loosely in a moving heap . Several mounted men chased the herd , hooting and slapping their thighs , slashing their whips at the slower horses , while a dozen or so dogs darted round the flanks of the mustangs , nipping at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive corralsuddenly loomed in the distance , row upon row of trenches scooped deeply out of the crumbling soil like open scars in the parched landscape , waiting to heal . Perched high above the corral , he watched , binoculars magnifying the sight , as the men and dogs tightened their trap around the herd , the wild ponies still frenzied though buckling in the surge of sun and sand and their sweating multitude . He heard the first shot ring out , and then the volley of rifles , mixed with the faint neighing of the panicked horses as the mounted men steered the herd toward the ditches . Some animals collapsed where they stood , others were dragged down by the force of their own speed and weight , keeling into the trenches , their necks and heads straining high in terror , gouging their last breath of air in the valley of death , halting abruptly as they rammed into each other , muzzles smashing against ribs as they tripped and toppled , heavingto stay erect , some trampled already , others clawing from below , rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a bullet or by the melee about them , sliding back into the ditch , a few still struggling hopelessly to leap out.  |p135The  onslaught subsided ; the ditches began to swell with the seething mass of horses , their neighing a distant tide in the vastnessof sand and rock . Soon only a few mares were left to roam the corral aimlessly . Now the mounted men abandoned the easy pleasures of the gun for the challenge of lasso and the illusion of the hunt . Mad with terror , the mustangs hurtled through the net of their trappers , yet one by one , the whirling noose of rope brought each mare down , strangling it into submission , to be dragged headlong toward the swollen trenches , the dogs howling , the mounts of the men , inflamed with blood and death , now as terrified as the animals they hauled . Fabian watched as the riders searched the horizon intently , to ensure that they had felled all the wild horses ; then they made a last tour of the heaving trenches , huddled flesh still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He noticed how quick , almost furtive , the men were about it , aware that the grassy plain they had cleared of wild mustangs was public land . The prosperous ranchers they worked for would soon bring their private cattle there to graze , the scarcity of grass no longer a threat . With the dogs in yapping pursuit , the men galloped away from the corral , heading toward their bunkhouses , their reward , chili , beans and beer . Slowly , Fabian descended to the plain , Big Lick 's nostrils twitching , quick with apprehension as it picked its way toward the mass graves , Gaited Amble reluctant to follow , sniffing the air , its head tossing . A curtain of dust hung in the air , drifting lightly over the valley , masking the rocks and flats with a grainy film . At Fabian 's approach , a thin , whistling moan rose from the ditches , a sigh of desolation . Panicked , Big Lick thrust sideways , almost unseating Fabian and jerking Gaited Amble at the end of the lead rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the three of them continued to make their way along the ditches . The tableau of massacre opened before him in all its grotesque composition . Cramped in heaps in the narrow furrows of the mass graves , most of the animals were dead ; some twitched , a last flicker of life . Settled at the brink of the spilling trough , Fabiansaw the mound of dead and dying mustangs as an infernal creation : meshed and intersecting heads , shoulders , hocks , eruptingmuzzles , ribs and tails , twisting coils of a monstrous snakep136that burrowed greedily through the stony ground of the valley , its scattered eyes blinking , its venomous mouth open , ready to strike , indicting earth and sky . Suddenly , Big Lick gave out a vast neigh , all its power and strength of life in the cry , sundering the deathly calm of the valley . Before it could rebound in echo , from one of the ditches came an answering shriek , muted yet still firm , the last voice of life calling to life . But before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third cry shivering the sky , the voice of a temporary victor in the battle of life , rallying the vanquished . As if at a signal , Fabian tightened his legs and threw Big Lick into a gallop . With Gaited Amble abreast , the curtain of dust veiling them still , he moved past the corral , across the mesa , through the plains and peaks , the valleys of Nevada . Early in the fall , after he had been idling on the road for about a week , he crossed into Arkansas and reached the Double Bridle Stables in Totemfield . As he drove up , the late afternoon sun was cresting over a string of spindly pine trees , their pointy tips like wooden arrows shafting the air , poised against the sky . Through the tracery of wood , the shell of an old mill hulked like a skull . Tiny cones of hemlock and spruce , a tangle of roots , littered his path . A drowsing melancholy invaded Fabian . Time always altered , rarely improved : the place looked shabby , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening years , he had aged as gracelessly . He felt degraded by his poverty , which had brought him here now , for the second time ; he wondered at the obsession that had once driven him here for the first . The obsessionhad been Vanessa . He remembered her , a student in his riding class , waiting for him at the paddock or riding off with him into the woods . The place had been filled with young riders , parents , instructors  --  a confusion of horses , cars and bicycles . Because of her , in their midst he had seen himself as a figure of charm , authority and influence . Then he had thought that one day he would return to claim her ; now , the more he looked around , the more uncertain he was of himself and of her.  |p137What  remained for him was the short walk to the office , where he would confront another woman from his past  --  but not to claim her . He parked his VanHome just beyond the main buildings , near the pond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of the stables . As he swung down from the cab of the VanHome , he caught sight of three Hackney foals gamboling in the paddock , whinnying in the quiet . Fabian found Stella in the office . She looked well , the dash of her riding breeches a sweep of black , setting off the burnishedgilt of her softly coiling hair , her skin even creamier than he had remembered . She had known when to expect him  --  he had telephoned a few hours earlier  --  but even so , he could not discern whether her allure was intended for him or for others . Face to face with her , Fabian felt a rush of withered emotion ; he could not plagiarize a past self , was unwilling to pretend that the sight of her touched him . He took off his jacket and sat across the desk from Stella . A handwritten calendar hung on one dirty wall , a schedule of riding classes scribbled all over it in red pencil , and tacked above it were a row of yellowing photographs : Stella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walking Horse , Stella exhibitinga two-year-old stallion , a champion of the Spring jubilee , Stella with members of the Walking Horse Breeders Association at Shelbyville , Stella accepting an award from the American LegionSaddle Club . In one snapshot , Stella , poised against a graceful black mare , was visibly in her teens . The picture could have served for a poster of a Southern belle posing with her favorite Tennessee Walker . Had the photographer moved his camera one inch to the right , the snapshot would have included Fabian , for the picture had been taken only a few days after Fabian met Stella for the first time , after she had attended his horsemanship classes . Now , as then , it was common for him to be at a horse show , as a spectator , or judging a competition , and suddenly hear his name called out : he would turn and face a young woman ,  |p138vibrant  , fresh and lovely , one of his former students . As she threw her arms about his neck , reminded him of who she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how well she remembered what he had taught her and the stories he used to tell her , Fabian registered the force of her transformed presence , her command of age and time . Yet he was trapped by uncertainty , what to say or do , conscious of the crossroads before which he stood , his dilemma sometimes observed by the young boyfriend , manly and handsome , whom the woman had discreetly left in the background . In her embrace , the return of her voice , Fabian sought the outline of the young girl he had once known , tempted to know if she might consent to a fresh bond he could devise for the two of them . But he was aware that the same process of time that had carried her to maturity had made of him a man in midlife . Closing in on youth  --  a young woman , a girl  --  Fabian could not resist its spell ; he was compelled , his instinct honed by anguish . He would fix with an intensity almost clinical , bordering on obsession , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that washed pupil and iris , each filament of hair that streamed from her head , the taut yet resilient skin that blanketed her bones and veins , the buoyancy of her flesh , its scent and feel not yet probed by another . All these were for him counters to the steady waste of time and age that raced between them . In that relentless flow , his age a constant subtraction , Fabian saw himself as the heir of time , an unransomable hostage to a past that was the only gift at his command . He saw himself appearing in a girl 's life as time 's agent , unbidden , indifferent to the drama of her destiny . He contemplated aligning himself next to her , unyoking their bodies to all that was spontaneous , involuntary  --  his flesh rising , erect , hers hardening , enfolding him as he sundered it , seed in its flood . Fabian was convinced that in first love , a young girl gave her love to her lover ; in later loves , love merely came to her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pony to bend to the curb , to the rein and the spur without prior schooling and cultivation , neither should he expect a young woman , healthy and beautiful , to come to him , a man more than twice her age , his home the road , his house a thing on wheels , a man of midis/tinguished looks and without obvious charm , with no riches to seduce , no particular skill to enthrall , and no profession that enhanced  --  above all , a man outside of permanence , able to offer only a few hours , days , weeks of his presence . For this reason , he had to find a girl while she was still susceptible to a man of his experience , a mentor , even if he could offer her no more than adventure in place of advice , weariness instead of wisdom . Usuallythe girl would still be in high school , still be living with her parents . In singling her out , cultivating her , arranging their first encounter alone , Fabian wished to initiate her , to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brand . He could not meet with the girl too many times without attractingunwanted attention , the notice of her fellow students , the teachers and staff of her school , often her parents . To avoid collision with the caprices of local laws , he would arrange no more than four or five meetings with the girl , some at public events , others in his VanHome . He saw to it that each meeting was intense enough to leave its mark for good . In every town or sprawling suburb , pastoral outpost or even city where he gave lessons in horsemanship , lectured sometimes or took part in various horse shows or polo meets , Fabian kept a watch for two or three girls who would , he hoped , yield to him without mistrust . Sometimes as he watched a young girl off in the corner of a stable , wholly absorbed in the patient ritual of waxing , flexing , polishing , buffing the riding gear and tack that lay clustered about her , he understood that horses were another embodiment of the dolls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable babies they had nurtured in their adolescent fantasies . To horses they brought devotion and a passionate loyalty that did not falter . They cosseted them , were sensitive to their needs , anointed lovingly their lesions and sores . In the routine of grooming  --  the combing , soaping , brushing  --  they took a quiet pleasure , almost domestic . He understood , also , that with conventionsof family and school weakened or discarded , myths and traditions of physical weakness and submission challenged , a girl riding at hunt or dressage , taking a jump , revealed and claimed her power to master , direct , and bend to her will a horse , a living creature so much larger and more powerful than herself.  |p140Quickening  to ripeness more swiftly than boys of the same age , girls revealed a more balanced temperament , coordination whetted to a tauter pitch . They often seemed to Fabian a curious union of ballet dancer and gymnast , and in his classes he found that he could treat them as his equals , independent , responsible , alert , complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a certain competitive heat . Many of them had been bred on banal tales of life in the Old West , romantic fictions and fantasies of adventures in the saddle , and they projected themselves into the roles of those pulp heroines or heroes . They were determined to attract notice : fame was the spur , and they rode to win . Sometimes , after the initiation had been successfully accomplished , the inoculation had taken , the brand burned indelibly , Fabian 's interest in a girl began to wane . He might have consideredher a bad prospect for a future relationship , unimaginative , the life of her fantasy already depleted . Rather than waste his time arranging future meetings with the girl , or sustain her belief that he was going to see her again , he would break with her . He was wary , though , never to reject her too abruptly or with too visible finality . This he had learned shortly after the publication of his first book on equitation . The book , a novelty in its time , had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a steady flow of invitations to lecture or teach at various riding schools and academies . Among the first invitations he accepted was a request to join a house party  --  at which , of course , Fabian would be expected to show off his polo skill  --  at the Florida estate of a rich and powerful businessman , who had made his fortune in turnstilesand was celebrated for the horses he bred to race , as well as for the formidable array of breeds he maintained for polo and pleasure riding . Enclosed with the invitation was a gracious note from the millionaire , expressing the hope that Fabian would feel free to remain at the estate for several weeks as his guest . To adjust to changes in climate , which often affected his health and his riding performance , Fabian was in the habit of arriving for any assignment at least a day or two before he was expected.  |p141On  this occasion , still in the grip of a bad cold , he had left the Northeast a week earlier to escape the height of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane , released from the pressure of its claustrophobic cabin , soporific with the medicine he had been taking , he felt dazed by the wash of heat , the hypnoticlull of the palms , the distant glare of sand . He knew he should go directly to one of the small motels nearby , but , weak and light-headed , decided to inquire first at a horse and tack supplyshop about renting a horse challenging enough for the few days ' workout he felt he would need before showing up  --  and showing off  --  at the millionaire 's estate . The shop was cramped , a bit forlorn , but even in his distracted state , Fabian was pleasantly surprised to find his book displayed on a counter , near a blaring portable radio . He was leafing through the book when a salesgirl came out from a back room . Impulsively , he held up the book , with his photograph on the back jacket next to his face , and asked about local stables . The girl had no visible reaction to his four eyes contemplating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the owner was on vacation , that she herself had only started this job a few weeks before and that she knew nothing about horses or stables or where he might make any arrangements . Swept by a sudden vertigo , Fabian slumped against the counter still clutching his book ; the medicinehe had been taking , the plane trip , the onslaught of Southernheat had taken their toll . The girl hurried around to him and helped him to a chair . She was in her twenties , short and plump , with an open face . Her waist melted heavily into her hips . Her breasts , large and shapeless , seemed too heavy for her torso , and they shifted with every movement she made , pouring from side to side , slappingagainst her ribs , sloping down when she leaned over . She offered to call a taxi to take him to his motel , but when he told her he had not yet arranged for one , with floating neutrality she suggested that he come to her place , where he could wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She quickly fixed the portable radio on a shoulder strap , closed the shop , brrnight her car around , and leaved his luggage into it , With Fabian lying on the back seat , she drove off.  |p142The  girl lived in a one-room apartment in a housing developmentdivided from the beach by a stretch of highway . In his feverish daze , Fabian did not object when she told him to go straight to bed , the only bed in the room , a slab of white in one corner . He undressed and climbed between cool sheets . He woke to a damp weight on his forehead , jolted into consciousness , unfamiliar with the place in which he found himself . The glare of a bedside lamp filtering through a plastic shade was raw on his eyes . Sitting beside him , the girl was impassively attentive , a blurred remembrance from that afternoon . As he stirred , she leaned forward and replaced the moist , tepid band on his forehead with the icy , welcome shock of a fresh cloth . " I had to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Southern flavor . " You seem to have a fever , and you need to drink something . I found these pills in one of your suitcases . " She pointed to a small bottle on the bedside table and then , like a nurse , drew him toward her as she plumped up the pillow behind his head , brushing his face with her shoulder . He was dimly surprised to notice that his suitcases had been unpacked , the shirts stacked on a shelf , his suits , jackets , riding breeches and tuxedo all hung on a pole bracketed below the shelf . She brought him a cup of soup , and he drank it slowly . She watched as he washed down the pills with a large glass of orange juice . When he was finished , she turned off the light by the bed . " Now you go back to sleep , " she said . " Where will you sleep ? " he asked . " Over there . " She pointed to another corner of the room . " I 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room 's single window , he drowsed , drifting on a skim of sensation : the taste of oranges and tea and some kind of broth , an egg trembling in a cup , deep tides of sleep , the murmur of words , doors opening and shutting , a sudden bark of traffic . Dreams obliterated the shapes and contours of the room he was in . Sometimes he would become aware that a stranger was lying somewhere on the floor , near him . Abruptly , in blackness , he awoke ; alert , instantly sober , he knew at once the fever had gone . Thirsty , he got up and silently picked his way toward the kitchenette , past the girl lyingp143curled on top of the sleeping bag , a blanket over her shapelessbulk . As the weak light of the refrigerator trickled across the room , she sat bolt upright ; then , standing , trying to cover her breasts with the blanket , she plaintively urged him to go back to bed . When he refused , greedily draining the jug of orange juice he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cajoling , her hand dragging on his arm . As he shook her off , the blanket slipped from her grasp and rustled to the floor . She stood before Fabian , naked , her body softly nurturing . Unreasoning , he reached for her , drawing her close , her breasts pressing against his chest , her thighs parting . He pulled her across the room , and they fell on the bed , her hands pressing him into her belly . He took her rapidly , almost forcefully , overwhelmedby her opulence , her body unfolding to him in pleats , absorbing his weight . In the days that followed , Fabian , her patient , was also her lover . He was not yet strong enough to ride ; instead , he would have breakfast with her before she left for the shop , then stroll down to the beach and doze in the shade , waking to sunbathe for a while , then withdrawing to the shadow of an umbrella to sleep again . The girl would bring lunch to the beach , her radio slung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sit beside him , sometimes tossing an orange from hand to hand in mindless rhythm , sometimes reeling and unreeling a yo-yo , watching its motion in fascination . She seemed to wear no clothes other than a bleached denim jacket and shapeless pants . For these beach excursions , she was topped with an old Royal Canadian Mountie 's hat , its strap undone and trailing behind her shoulder . As she plodded across the sand , her face under that incongruoushat , Fabian thought of her as a refugee from some nameless war , forgotten , still in futile wandering , searching for a place she might call her own . She always stayed fully clothed on the beach . Fabian guessed that , conscious of her body , of its fat creasing in layers , she would not undress . He watched her covertly when small packs of teen-agers , their bodies lithe and tanned , easy in the sun , surfboards under their arms , passed by , giggling and snickeringat the two of them . The girl pretended to ignore the mockery ,  |p144but  Fabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She told her story neutrally , from a distance , almost as if recitingthe history of someone else . She had been born in the slums of San Francisco , the bastard child of white parents whom she never knew . A Japanese-American family had boarded her as a foster child , but they had no interest in the education of girls and let her drop out of high school . Soon afterward , exasperated at the government 's many years of refusal to compensate them for their internment in a concentration camp during World War II , her foster parents decided to go back to Japan with their natural children . Alone , the girl drifted around the country , hitchhiking , taking occasional odd jobs , picking up stray bits of lore and skill , always migrant . She had arrived in Florida only recently , and in her tiny apartment Fabian could detect almost no testimony to her being  --  the Mountie 's hat , a large map of the United States , folded and smudged with use , the yo-yo , stubs of food stamps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook bobbed when he brushed past it . Paperback books , shiny and untouched , were lined up neatly on a shelf . The books  --  all practical , Fabian noticed , in the " how-to " vein , with nothing in common , and among them not a novel , a single work of reflection , an anthology of poems  --  were guarded by twin toy flags . A little sticker  --  " The Stars and Stripes Forever "  --  ran across one flag , while the other showed the rising sun of Japan on a cube of murky white . A bulky television set , incongruous in the cell of the girl 's apartment , claimed one wall wholly to itself . For the girl , after the routine of the shop , the drowse of lunch on the beach , the ritual of supper , it was her own rising sun , the reward at the end of the Canadian Mountie 's trail . She would hurry through washing the dishes each night  --  Fabian could not recollect her hurrying through anything else  --  and then she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Eating or yawning , she rose only to change a channel of which she was inexplicably tired or to replenish the plate of cookies that kept her company , the plastic dish of ice cream that seemed never empty , never full . She was not indifferent to Fabian , but merely unable to recognize that 1w might not share her delightp145and fascination with television , that its deafening sound and turbulent images ruled out any notice the two of them could take of each other 's presence or wishes . Fabian saw her as television 's faithful babysitter , standing watch over a child that never offered her an unruly face , never encroached on her world , never imposed on her energy . She did not resent that it lived a life so much more crowded , eventfuland frenetic than her own . She seemed to take reassurance from its world without rank ; its ordered rhythm ; its slots of time ; the steady punctuation of cheering commercials that remindedher of life 's arsenal of unrealized needs and wants but did not rebuke her failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the unceasing parade of stars , their deaths never final ; life 's mysteries exposed by lovers who marry or divorce ; villains murdering or being killed ; diseases that consumed or were cured ; wars that began and quickly ended , planets lost and regained . Under the girl 's care , Fabian recovered , restored to the fitness he would require for the pleasures of the millionaire 's house party , if not for the demands of team polo there . The girl knew where he was going  --  he had told her of the invitation , asking about the route that led to the estate  --  but in his last day or two , whenever the subject surfaced , she would nod impassively and turn back toward the television set , the yo-yo unspooling betweenher fingers . On the morning Fabian had set for his departure , she drove him to a car rental agency , where , her breasts jiggling under the shabby jacket , she helped him to carry his luggage from her car to the one he had just rented . At the curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her again , to visit , to keep in touch ; he could not tell whether she was resentful at his leaving . The Mountie 's hat shielded her eyes . The cackle of country and western music spilling from her radio was in Fabian 's ears as he drove away , her features already fading in his memory . Installed in a guesthouse at the millionaire 's sprawling estate , Fabian succumbed readily to luxury . Each clay , after breakfast  --  son ietinies at the pool , usually in his own quarters  --  lie watched as two of his host 's many helicopters rose from a nearby field ,  |p146hovered  briefly in the morning haze , then began to ply their rounds , bringing guests from airport to estate . Other guests came in chauffeured limousines and in cars of every vintage and make , racing drivers sometimes at the wheel ; and guests arrived by yacht or private plane or even an occasional motorcycle , no place unfilled at the day 's end , the grounds a pleasure garden where the rich withdrew to consider providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactureleisure , the idle to play at occupation . In the stables and paddocks , where Fabian was most at home , horsemen trailing Olympic glory mingled with polo players and matchless jockeys who had ridden . their host 's Thoroughbreds to victory . At the pool , they socialized with wizards of industry and finance , designers from Malibu and Big Sur , political impresariosand their cronies from Washington and New York , the sharks of Palm Beach bridge and backgammon tournaments . In the evening , nightclub performers , released from their Miami engagements , dropped by to hold court , perhaps to entertain , often staying over to lend their glamour to a game of golf or tennis . In the lounges of the main house and on tables beside the pool , several copies of Fabian 's book on equitation had been placed . Its presence was a consequence of two or three complimentaryreferences Fabian had made in it to his host 's achievementsin international polo as well as to his splendid stable of Argentinean ponies . To a number of guests in the party , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host , and Fabian soon found himself , at drinks or dinner or while he was watching a game , the friendly target of those who had read , or merely seen , his book and now wanted to talk to him about polo , riding or horses . It was here , in the seductive atmosphere of easy acclaim , that Fabian met Eugene Stanhope , who initiated their friendship with that sudden whim of the very rich , so that , before Fabian quite knew what was happening , he found himself enlisted as a friend and working as a polo partner of a man he hardly knew . Soon after Fabian 's arrival , the host gave a supper party around the pool , to celebrate the birthday of another guest , an elegant young Texan socialite , a divorcee who had settled in for a leisurelyp147stay . Her interest in Fabian was evident  --  she had asked him to inscribe a copy of his book to her as a birthday present  --  and Fabian was just about to ask her to dance when a small group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Impatient , he lingered with them for a few moments and was edging toward his Texan quarry when a servant approached and drew him aside , whispering that a young lady had just arrived , claiming to be a friend of Fabian 's . Baffled , Fabian followed him through the halls to a small drawing room . There he saw her , his unexpected visitor , the girl who had nursed him through his fever , awkward amid the ghostly network of rattan , the billow of cushions , a forlorn blur against the paintings . Still in the denim jacket and baggy pants , but without her radio , the girl saw him and ran forward , bobbing on her short legs , the Mountie 's hat slipped down her back , bouncing . " I missed you . I had to come to see you , " she said , reaching up to embrace him . The servant , his task accomplished , withdrew discreetly . Fabian gently sat her down on one of the love seats . " You should have called first , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your voice is n't enough . I miss you , " she replied . Unnerved , Fabian glanced about . Through the French windowsof the drawing room , thrown open to the night languor , he could see across to the terrace , with its steady promenade of guests , couples gliding between the manicured hedges of the garden , lingering at the carved iron benches strewn about the lawn , the cool white or black jackets of the men , the women in their drifts of chiffon , trailing Spanish shawls . He was acutely aware that at any moment someone might enter the room and come upon him and his guest . Caught in alliance with a girl whose very existence elicited condescension and incredulity , he would have to introduce her ; he was afraid , also , that she might subject him to further humiliation by naively volunteering her reasons for having come in search of him . " Why do you miss me ? " he asked impatiently . " I just do , " she said , smiling , her breasts , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed me ? " Fabian 's irritation grew as he renumbered that , by the poolp148or in the gardens , the divorcee might be talking to another man ; he had no time to lose . " I remember you , " he said sternly . " But I have n't missed you  --  at least not yet , " he added , to soften the impact of his words . " Can I stay here with you ? " He could not hide his annoyance . " Stay with me  --  here ? " " Yes . Until you have to leave . I took a week off from my job . " He was angry now . " No , you ca n't , " he said coldly . " Youhave n't been invited . " A couple from the garden appeared in the doorway . They glanced at the paintings across the room and were about to move in to look at some photographs when they saw Fabian and the girl . Fabian shifted in the love seat , turning his back to the couple . Smiling wanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications of his manner . " You can invite me now , " she said . " I can stay with you in your room . " You ca n't and wo n't . I do n't want you here ! " Fabian said decisively , standing up . " You 're going home , and you 're leaving now . She sat there , lumpish . " But why ? I can help with the horses , " she said , convinced that what she wanted would come to pass . " You 're going home . Now , " Fabian announced , reaching down to take her by the arm . But she still made no move , and instinctivelyhe pulled at her , suddenly rough . She winced at the pressure and stood up . " Please let me stay , " she said . " I want to see you . I want to see you ride . " " Home . Go . " He dragged her by one arm toward the door . Reluctant , her pants flapping , she followed . Outside , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might come face to face with other strolling guests . He quickly guided her to a service road reserved for deliveries . " I brought my sleeping bag with me . I could sleep in the woods and just see you during the day . " There was a note of stubborn pleading in her voice . She attempted once again to embrace him ; once again , he pushed her away . " You 're going home , " he insisted . As he pulled her remorse/lessly forward , the bobbing of her Mountie 's hat kept time with their steps . They reached the gate of the service road . In the haze of the solitary lamp , he saw the sullen resignation on her face . He pushed her firmly through the gate and , without a backward glance , quickly returned to the main house . The divorcee was where he had left her , graceful , draped along a lounge chair beside the pool , one finger idling in his book . But she was practicedin resistance that Fabian found a challenge and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next morning , at stick-and-ball practice with several of the other guests , Fabian was riding along the field when a spot of familiar shape and color blinked out at him from the spectators in the stands : the Royal Canadian Mountie 's hat and a shabby jacket . In a flush of rage , he reined his horse in sharply , wheeling , then drove it straight at the stands . The girl clumped down the wooden planks toward him , eager , her sandals clapping against the wood , her shoulders plunging , coming at him , the landscape of her chest bouncing . Fabian loomed over her , his pony snorting , his mallet erect , almost poised to strike . A few women in the stands looked down , murmuring , amused at the mismated pair . Fabian kept his voice low . " What are you doing here ? " he asked . She came closer , her face next to the horse 's muzzle . From it , a trickle of saliva dribbled onto the bulge under her jacket . She did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to see you , " she said smiling . " I miss you . " " I told you to go home , " he said . He prodded her with the mallet . " I slept in the woods , " she said . " It was nice . I liked waiting for you like that . " He was aware that their encounter was being observed on the field . From a distant corner , two players started to ride in his direction . " You have to go home ! " he hissed . " I 'll wait for you over there , " the girl said evenly , pointing at the woods beyond the limits of the field . " Please come . " " You 're going home , " he said . Bristling uneasily , his pony wasp150quicker to pick up his agitation than the girl . She looked up at him again . When Fabian saw her smile , he knew his words had passed over her mind like yet another image from television . " In the woods , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the cactuses . " Her smile was gentle , a homage . She grasped nothing of his anger . " But if you ca n't come , do n't worry ; I 'll wait anyhow . " " Do what you want . " His voice was savage . " I wo n't be coming . " He kicked the pony into a sudden turn , spraying her with dirt as he took off across the field . After practice , a picnic lunch was served in the meadow next to the polo field . The guests lounged on a brilliant patchworkof cloths and pillows on the grass while waiters in white jackets dispensed the generosity of the household . A flurry of sprouting champagne corks ruffled a flock of pheasants from their roost in the distant tall grasses ; in pluming alarm , they streaked toward the woods . Fabian sauntered away from the picnic , crossing the fragrant meadow . Flushed with champagne and the exertions of the morning , he stumbled slightly at a break in the ground . The meadow gave way to a stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way through the shaggy blanket of prickles . In the midday blaze , a cadaverous breath rose from the plants ' spiny branches , their corpselike stems . He came to the end of the cactus field and followed a narrow path that led him to a bower deep within a wooded thicket . There he saw the girl , framed in bramble . She was humming a song , waiting . When she saw him , she heaved herself up , pushingher way through a maze of wild hops . " I knew you 'd come , " she said . " I just knew . " As her arms reached toward him , the heat thick about them , Fabian submitted to a tide of rage and shoved her away with such force that she fell backward , tumbling into a bed of blackthorn . " Why did you do that , Fabian , why ? " she asked , puzzled , withoutfear , clumsily getting up . " All I want is to see you . Please let me . " She was on her feet now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brambles and crushed white petals . " You are going home ! " he screamed . A bird , cawing , took flight at the echoing sound . The pitiful look of entreaty on her face , her stubbornness , enraged him more . He began to hit her , the palm of his hand slapping one cheek , then the other , the back of his hand tearing across her face . He was screaming , " You 're going home , you 're going home . " The girl swayed , her breasts pouring from side to side with each blow , then she stumbled to her knees , her eyes misted with tears . She covered her face with her hands . " But why , Fabian , why ? " she moaned , unleashing another crest of fury within him . Abruptly lucid , he stopped , drained , the rage spent . He raised a quivering hand to his parched mouth . Drawing breath in quick gasps , he looked down at her , prone at his feet , grass bending dreamily over her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimper . " Because I do n't want you here . That 's why ! Do you understand ? " Trembling , he tried to regain his steadiness . She rose slowly , small forking reeds sticking to her face . " Without you , my life just is n't much , " she mumbled through her tears . " If it 's not much without me , it 's not much with me , " Fabian said . " All I want is to see you . " The refrain was unrelenting . " To be near you , where you are . All I have is you . " As quickly as it had fled , the fury took him again . He grabbed the girl by her hair and , twisting her head , brought his face close to hers . Her hair was sweaty and matted in his hand , her pale , freckled skin already swelling from his blows . " All I want is to see you , to be near you , " he mimicked , her hair still clutched in one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts . He went on , ripping the suspendersthat held up her pants , then pulling at the pants until they fell in a heap about her ankles , revealing gray shorts underneath . " I 'm not your TV , you ca n't turn me on when you want to ! " he shouted , shoving her away . She tumbled , trying helplessly to stop her breasts from slapping about her rib cage , her fleshy thighs a rash of reddish insect bites . " Not your TV ! " he screamed.  | " You have nothing but yourself , " he went on shouting , " and do you ever think about yourself ? See yourself ? Listen to yourself ? You have n't read one book , done one thing that would force you to find out what it is you want from life or what it is life still might give you . " He could hear his voice raging in the silent grove . " You think of nothing , you see nothing , you understand nothing . " He was breathless , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , nothing to share . Your emotions are as crude as your body , your mind as slow as your ass , your life as empty as your feelings . Your TV deserves your company  --  I do n't . " She sat up , turning toward him , brushing the grass from her face . " Maybe one day you wo n't mind me . " He heard her burp suddenly , like a child . " One day ' is a long time away . Too long for me . " He started to move toward the path . She scrambled to her feet , hiking up her pants , her hair rumpled with the debris of the woods , her skin mottled and livid . " I know you 're alone , there 's no one to look after you , " she stammered . " I 'll wait for you . I 'll be here . " Thought abandoned him . He stopped at the edge of the grove , turned back and walked over to her . Seizing her shoulders , he began to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body pulpy , jerking , her breasts bobbing as if they would break loose from her body . " Do n't bother ! " he screamed . " Do n't bother to wait ! I 'll be on another channel ! " He pushed her and saw her thud to the ground . Sweat glazed his forehead and neck . Without feeling , his heart pounding , he looked at the blur that lay sprawled on the ground , snuffling and sobbing quietly into the grass . He leaned against a tree for support , his thoughts as shapeless and undefined as the girl on the grass . He turned again into the forest , dragging greedily , in gasping relief , on the air that flowed back over him . He plunged along the narrow path , crushing berries beneath his feet , staining his boots , the tangled burrs and knifing weeds pulling at him . Trembling still , he stopped every few moments to get his bearings , his mind a vortex of sensation : fury at the girl , a rankling resentment that he had succumbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cactus plants , a flock of birds broke cover , sallying back to the dense safety of the thicket . A brood of tiny plover , hovering , agitated , marked his passage through their covert . At the guesthouse , Fabian found a note , from the divorcee , slipped under the door of his suite . She hoped that he might be free , after breakfast the following day , to instruct her in polo . He made himself a strong drink and ran a hot bath , savoring the promise and intimacy of the note . As his eyes returned to the fluent elegance of the note rustling between his fingers , Fabian resolved with a certain grim finality that , whatever he might lack in magnetism or glamour , in the resonance of family or name , in money or fame , he would never again permit himself to be made the puppet of a creature so maddeningly patheticas that girl he had just left in the woods . After his bath , he fell asleep , and the lump of the girl kept slipping into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest , he slept all afternoon and had dinner in his room , then went back to bed . The following morning he awoke alert , swept clean . In sanguinehigh spirits , he rose and dressed with meticulous care for his encounter with the divorcee . At the stables , he picked out a string of ponies for their stick-and-ball practice . He was just about to mount one of the ponies when he heard a man , scuttling along in an electric golf cart , calling out his name . Fabian , unable to place him securely in memory , stopped , with a vague tug of recollection . The man , nondescript in dress , left his cart and came toward Fabian , poised at his horse . " Excuse me , sir . It was I who brought to you the young lady the other night , " he explained , cap in hand , a touch of halting servility in his voice . " Yes , you did indeed , " Fabian said . He was convinced the man had come to announce her return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked coldly . Ile briskly checked the tension of the straps in the pony 's bridle . The man hesitated . Ile would not meet Fabian 's eyes . " In a way , yes . " His reply was a mumble . " Then you can tell her I'in busy , " Fabian said , vaulting ontop154his pony . He looked down from the saddle . " And that I wo n't see her . " He pivoted his pony in front of the man as the animal frisked , eager to break away . " I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to do that , " the man said , his voice firm . " I think you will , " Fabian insisted . " Just tell her I asked you to deliver that message . " His manner stern , the servant raised his eyes to Fabian . " That 's a message I ca n't deliver , " he said . Fabian shifted uneasily in the saddle as the apprehension rose within him that the girl once again might ruin a tryst with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said angrily . " Just tell me where I can find her . " The man lowered his gaze . " She is at the service gate , " he said . Fabian squeezed the pony with his legs and cantered off along the path that circled the stables , leading to the kitchen wing . At the gate , he saw the morning sun blinking on chrome : two police cars , a huddle of black men and women about them . As he dismounted , faces turned toward him . He strode to the gate , noting almost mechanically the odd angle at which some of the field hands held their hats , as if in tribute . His eyes swept the crowd , grimly expecting the Canadian Mountie 's hat . He finally saw it , settled neatly on a picket fence nearby . Then he saw the girl 's familiar shape . Heart pounding , his throat gone rigid , mouth caked , knees braced only by his boots , the polo mallet trembling in his grasp , he moved along the road toward the fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . From the boundary post that marked the limit of the fence , the girl 's body swayed . He stared at the coarse , dun-colored rope that furrowed her neck , the thick wooden column climbing above her head , the empty fruit basket , yellowing straw , its load of grapefruit strewn about , kicked away when she did not want its support anymore . He saw the familiar jacket , its buttons ripped off , hanging open , the dull flesh of her breasts , her baggy pants , their suspenders drooping around her hips , the sandals , their straps cracking , their heels worn down . His eyes returned to her face , which had been wrenched by the drag of the rope to one side , tilted upward , her mouth open ,  |p155the  tongue frozen upon a lip as if to cover a scar . A butterfly , a shimmer of amber , flickering , tremulous , hovered in descent on a glassy eye that could not blink it away , defenseless before the assaulting sun . He saw the marks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scratches on her breasts , the reddish patch on her thigh . A hand on his shoulder scalded him . He turned to face one of the policemen . " We 're told she came here to see you , " the policeman said in a matter-of-fact voice as he gestured toward the body with an open notebook in his hand . " That 's what she told me , " Fabian replied . He tried to measure his tone against the other man 's . " And what did you tell her ? " the policeman asked . " I told her , " Fabian began to stammer , " I told her to go home . " The policeman looked up from his notebook . " What else did you tell her ? " " I told her  --  to leave me alone . " The policeman scribbled something in his notebook . " What else ? " " To leave me alone . Not to bother me anymore , " Fabian said . " That 's all ? " " That 's all . " Fabian stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess she took your advice , " he said . For a long time , Fabian had been in the habit of leafing through The Saddle Bride , a trade journal of the horse world that also chronicled the social milieus of tournament , turf , stable and show . Each month , he would examine the feature " Ladies of Horse : Who 's Who Under Seventeen , " columns betweenadvertisements for riding apparel and gear , notices of forthcoming meets , trivia of the track . The glossy pages would slide through his fingers : photographs of young horsewomen  --  jumping , at the paddock , in frill show regalia , in ball gowns or riding breeches  --  accompanied by brief accounts of their rich and usually prominent families , the medals and competitive stand/ings the girls had received , their parties , their aspirations and engagements , their homes , the stables they frequented , their favorite mounts . Fabian would thoughtfully sift through an issue of The Saddle Bride , selecting young women , his intention to approach each subtly and to engage in an intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation , Fabian arrived in Shelbyville with a solitary polo pony in his VanHome 's stall , a Morgan acquired for a third of its value because the brown stallion had no proof of ancestry . Fabian had been hired by a group of prominent Tennessee horse breeders to conduct a series of lectures for young teachers of horsemanship , in which he would explore developments and revivals in riding and jumping . He had accepted the job because , some months earlier , he had been drawn to a photograph of Stella , in The Saddle Bride , receiving her award as champion of the Plantation Pleasure competition ; the caption went on to cite her accomplishments in numerous other amateur shows of the Walking Horse Breeders Association , as well as in the Breeder 's Futurity event for young riders . Anxious to meet her , Fabian telephoned Stella at the nearby boarding school from which she had just graduated with honors ; he had read that she would be staying on there throughout the summer to continue training her horse , at a stable in the vicinity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend his lecture series as his guest . She was hesitant at first , but finally consented . At his opening lecture , Fabian saw her slip in , alone , and sit on a bench at the back of the hall , apart from the others . Stella was fashioned in the classic American mold , the pearly oval of her face lighted by topaz eyes , spaced wide , her blonde hair sweeping easily about her neck and brushing her sensually protrusive jaws . The high arch of her cheekbones framed a small nose , its tip flattened , and lips , oddly thick , in which Fabian caught a flicker of insolence . Yet he noticed as well her shyness , a holding back . It was only after Fabian had spent several brief interludes with her , having coffee , discussing horses , that Stella began to warm to him , to speak of herself , of her family . Her parents had been divorced when she was still a child , and each had remarried . Far removed , to New York and New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preoccupied with the children of thesep157unions , they had scant time for Stella , their first daughter , now grown , on the brink of womanhood . Several days later , Stella invited Fabian to visit her at the stable where she kept her horse , Ebony 's Ebony , her favorite possession . Fabian found her dressed in a rough leather blouse , leather chaps sheathing her jeans , which stressed her well-defined , juttingbuttocks . The tough , supple hide threw into sharp relief the fragile , lambent glow of her neck . She was trotting Ebony 's Ebony around the paddock , carefully guiding the horse , the heavy chains attached to its forelegs  --  the action-inducing devicesused in training gaited horses  --  clanging harshly . Ebony 's Ebony , a Tennessee Walking horse , was descended from the old plantation walking horse , which had carried planters and their overseers . Like most Southern owners of the breed , Stella kept the mare in constant training , refining and perfecting the horse 's three gaits : a flat-footed walk , a fluid canter and the high-breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground separately , that was its hallmark . Fabian watched as Stella monitored the time and intervals of each of the horse 's hoofs as it struck the ground , beating out a diagonal sequence . Intermittently , the horse lost rhythm , breakinginto a mosaic of disjointed fragments  --  its heaving chest and front strained to the running walk , its haunches , buckling under Stella , still at a trot , the extravagant licking of the forelegs hesitantand askew . Discouraged , Stella dismounted and took the horse to her workroom , at the rear of the stable . Jars of ointment , lubricants , a gallery of weights , hoof wedges , pads and chains of every size and thickness , crowded its shelves . Stella guided Ebony 's Ebony carefully to a space at the center of the room and , after tying the animal between two posts , she dismantled the armory of chains crusted around its forelegs . The horse , unyoked , pawed the ground in quickening anticipation , heaving slightly , eyes alert . Just above the hoofs of Ebony 's Ebony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , others suppurating , striated , an inflamed cincture like a decoration around the horse 's pasterns . Stella took a jar and a pair of rubber gloves from one of the shelves ; hunch/ing down , she began patiently to smear the ulcerated beds on the mare 's forelegs with a viscous paste . She explained to Fabian that , like so many other owners of Tennessee Walkers , she was forming a " sore lick "  --  an open sore in the flesh that pressure from a chain or a weighted boot would keep raw and sensitive . To alleviate the pain , the horse was driven to distort its prance and spring , an alteration that permitted the animal to develop what its breeders claimed to be its predisposition for the running walk . Stella went on explaining that most commercial preparations for such soring treatment did not satisfy her . Some were too potentand cauterizing , others too bland . Therefore , she had concoctedher own blends of soring paste , ranging from one so volatilethat it almost singed the flesh when crammed under the boots or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so subtle that one could leave it on the horse 's foreleg overnight or even for a day , confident that it would slowly raise the sore one desired . She hoped that all her efforts would be rewarded at summer 's end , permitting her to qualify Ebony 's Ebony for the National Celebration in Shelbyville , the country 's most spectacular exhibitionof Tennessee Walking horses , and thus to transform Ebony 's Ebony from a local blue-ribbon horse into a national prizewinner . With each new layering of the paste , a quiver ran through Ebony 's Ebony . Tied between the posts , the mare seemed locked between warring impulses : rebelling against this distortion of its being yet willing to bend to a plan beyond questioning . The animal seemed to sense that the treatment meted out to its legs was part of a larger , more intricate and subtle design  --  one in which reward or fault had no part  --  than the random , fleeting flick of a whip on its rump , or a spur 's sudden nudge against its withers . Stella entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lover 's tenderness in her voice . " I used to watch Tennessee Walkers when I was a little girl . They have a harmony no other breed has . " Ebony 's Ebony shuddered slightly as Stella 's gloved fingers smoothed the paste . She flexed the horse 's foreleg for Fabian 's inspection . Ebony 's Ebony flinched , but Stella 's grasp was confident , secure . She looked up at Fabian for a moment , her eyes innocent and serene , her neck velvety . " I like to think of Ebony 's Ebony as my partner  --  all that power , yet without Incp159the horse would n't be able to show what it can do , " she said . She shifted around Ebony 's Ebony to begin her labors on the other leg . " To get the horse to do that running walk , that nodding of its head in rhythm , that big lick , are n't you crippling it ? " Fabian asked . She passed over his question with a smile . " Crippling ? Its runningwalk is important  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gait ! " Fabian was unconvinced . " I 've ridden horses in Latin America , the Paso Finos , that perform their inborn gaits without any training , with no special boots . If your Tennessee Walker has natural gaits , why do you have to sore its legs and force it to wear those boots and chains ? " Stella shrugged . " The natural tendency to do its special gaits has to be brought out , " she explained patiently . " It has to be shaped , improved , enhanced by training , just as you have to train a Thoroughbred , to bring out its potential for racing or jump-ing . " " To train , yes , but not by burning its flesh , by burdening it with weights and boots and chains ! " " It 's not that different from what trainers do to other breeds . " Stella 's voice grew sharp , but she was still gentle as she smoothed soring paste on the horse 's foreleg . " How much training does it take to get a Thoroughbred to strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over six-foot-high fences and seven-foot-wide triple bars at a jumping competition ? Jumping is n't natural to a horse ; even when it 's hungry , it wo n't jump over a fence or a ditch to reach food . " She glanced at Fabian with a look of mild irony . " And what about that Morgan locked in your trailer ? What did it have to endure to become fit for polo ? And what does a polo pony go through during the game ? " " Leaping and chasing , the sheer spirit of nulning , are part of the horse 's nature , " Fabian said . " Sores and chains and boots are n't . " " Neither is the bridle or the whip , the spur or the saddle  --  even the rider , " she flared hack . Then she shifted into a new , soberly impersonal key . " I do n't manipulate 1 ? lxmy 's Ebony intop160any tricks or stunts that nature did n't make possible in the first place . I merely guide the horse in discovering its essence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago , " Fabian said gently , " I was one of the members of the American Horse Protection Association who testified in Congress on behalf of the Horse Protection Act . " Stella listened , her expression guarded , unchanging , as Fabian went on . " That act outlawed soring as well as overbooting . It prohibits the use of any substance or device for the purpose of affecting a horse 's gaits . It also outlaws any practices that might cause the horse physical pain or distress or inflammation , or bring on lameness . What if Ebony 's Ebony should be disqualified before the National Celebration because of what you 've done to it  --  and what if the inspectors should prosecute you ? " Unperturbed , Stella stood up . " Ebony 's Ebony is just one of thousands of Tennessee Walkers and American Saddle horses being trained . There are only about two dozen federal inspectors  --  they could hardly check the condition of every horse ! " " But do you want to break the law ? " " What law ? That Horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything about the South , anything about our Tennessee Walker . They still ca n't tell the difference between soring and lubricating , between padding and overbooting  --  so they want to ban it all ! " Stella wiped paste from her gloved fingers as methodically as she had applied it to Ebony 's Ebony . " What if all this talk about the horse 's essence is only a myth , just a convenient excuse to justify training practices that enable the animal to compete more strongly on the open market against other breeds , some of them better endowed by nature ? " said Fabian , patting the horse on its muzzle . " What if what you do to these horses is just a derivative of what the Southern masters used to do to their slaves ? " Stella ripped off the gloves and tossed them into a corner . " That 's nonsense , " she said decisively . " Our horses are the result of careful breeding , and our training methods bring out inherited genetic characteristics that have been scientifically proven to exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinct  --  to wipe out a whole industry . hundreds of thou/sands of people who love , breed , trade and exhibit these horses , our whole way of life down here  --  all that would go . " She started to release Ebony 's Ebony from the bonds that had immobilized it . " In any case , " she said with a mischievous glance , " under that Horse Protection Act so dear to you , no incident of soring or overbooting has ever come to trial  --  and I kind of doubt that one ever will . " She smiled at him guilelessly . Ebony 's Ebony champed and stretched in its new freedom . Fabian remained silent , and Stella , her tone casual , said that , after the National Celebration , she would attend a college in Kentucky . It was the only one in the country that allowed its students to major in horsemanship and stable management ; she wanted to study new methods of training the Tennessee Walking horse . There was a spirit and resolve in her manner that sharpened Fabian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he had not been able to break her equanimity , that without bolder action on his part during what remained of summer , he would soon be forced to relinquish Stella to the demands of her new calling . She had declined all invitations to visit him in his VanHome , resisted or averted his other solicitationsto intimacy . Her privacy challenged him , piqued his curiosity to know whether she was involved with another man . The gathering force of his fascination drew him increasingly to the stable at which she worked . Fabian wondered what means he would have to use to seduce Stella . The slightest details of her manner , her demeanor , the texture of her daily life possessed him . He watched for any sign of weakness , a rent in the fabric . He found none . Her ability to reconcile her love of Ebony 's Ebony with the knowledge of the pain her training caused the animal only deepened her mystery for him . He came to suspect that for Stella the simple act of sexual taking , the ruptured tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Before he could take her , she would have to imagine herself as his willing partner , she world have to preparethe path of her surrender to him . Once she had done this , she would be his whenever he wanted her. **25;6147;TOOLONG into it , assuming it was coming from the east and he had probably gone off the western side of the road because he had not been walking facing traffic , he wandered amid ridges that rose at last to a level surface . Dubin , in gasping relief , stumbled onto the road . He chose , after a moment , what he thought was the direction to the highway and plodded on , holding his arm above his eyes , trying to see the way ahead . Now and then he could make out a utility pole streaked with snow , and overhead , glimpse the white-coated thick utility wire . Lowering his head against the wind he pushed on , stopping often to peer around through his snow-encrusted eyes . The snow snowed in his ears . He brushed it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps an eighth of a mile farther when he felt his galoshes sink into soft snow as a grove of trees opened before him . Disheartened , he knew he had lost the road again . Panic went through him in a lightning flash . He pictured himself running in circles , but managed to bring himself under control . Dubin stood motionless , breathing heavily , trying to work out where he was . The woods opened upon the light . No tracks of his own he could see beyond ten feet . Probably the road had turned , though not he with it . He must be somewhere near it , surely not far from the highway . Backtracking , he was once more in the open . He thought for a moment he knew where he was : the road had curved to the right as he had walked on level ground straight ahead , gone into the trees . If he had turned with the road and stayed with it he 'd soon have got to the highway . After about a mile , possibly via a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a truck in this wild weather  --  he 'd be safely into Center Campobello . To find his way he had to make the right next move . Dubin trudged along , stopping at intervals to listen for traffic sounds in the distance ; or perhaps a car on the road he 'd been walking . Sooner or later a clanking snowplow would come by ; sooner on the highway , later on this country road . He heard only the soughing wind . The storm was increasing in intensity , the wind blowing flowing sheets of snow over the road . Dubin turned from the wind . Snow crackled on his clothes . He heard a shrieking bird but could not see it . He thought of running but dared not  --  would break his leg if he stepped into a hole . A moment later overhead became strangely light but there was no sky . The wind abated . He pushed on . Why have n't I learned more about nature ? Which way is north ? He had seen moss on all sides of a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't if you live in them . He felt a chill of fear , an icy trickle on his head , his brain pierced by cold . With a cry Dubin tore off his hat and slapped it savagely on his arm , beating off the wet snow . The red wool hat in his hand startled him . He was tired . Coming to a low stone wall  --  would it be bounding a road or dividing a field ?  --  farmers sold their fields with walls running through them  --  Dubin climbed over it , following until the snow-covered wall ended in a spill of rocks amid trees ; then he slowly traced it back the other way . The wind had decreased in force but the coarse wet flakes were falling so rapidly he could barely see five feet ahead of him . He thought he might follow the wall , touching it with his hand ; but it was not there to be touched . He was into a grove of sparse trees once more . The woods were gusty with wind , impossible to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry for help ? Who would hear him in the wailing wind ? If a car passed nearby its windows would surely be shut . Who could hear his shouts ? As Dubin came out of the trees he pictured an abandoned house . He pictured the kind of hut children built and left in the fields . After walking up the long flank of a rise and then down , he was again at a gray lichencoveredstone wall  --  the same ?  --  another ? He must stay with it , see where it led . The wall crumbled as he climbed it . Dubin , after a while , got up , brushed off his pants , limped on . He went through a grove of knee-high pines , then beheld a stand of tall whitened Norway pines . Where were these trees ? He was almost certain he had seen them close to the road before the bend to the highway where the road sloped on the right . But there was no downward slope he could feel , let alone see . Are these pines where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ? What a mad thing not to have stayed home with my small stationary miseries . Now I risk my life . He thought he ought not move until he could think of something sensible to do next . How few choices there are when the weather is white , wind fierce , snow thick . I am mad to be here . He jabbed a finger at the sky . There was a man in his mind wandering forever in deep snow . Dubin beat his breast . He heard his mother 's voice . Leo , she called . I could drown here as my brother did in the ocean . Exhausted , he sank to the ground and crawled under the branches of a spruce . Here was room to sit , perhaps rest . Above , the drooping branchesp152were heavy with snow , the lower ones dry tufts of green . The beige spruce needles that covered the ground between trees were dusted with patches of white . He sat with his back to the broad spruce tree , waiting for fatigue to ease , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet where Dubin sat , though he could hear the wind still groaning in the swaying trees , and every once in a while a clump of snow fell , sifting like mist through the spruce . He would wait till he had recovered his strength to get up and go on being lost . His lungs seared his chest . He could feel his mouth trembling . Despite the cold he felt sweaty ; he felt his age . It was easy enough to sit under a tree but he feared the woods filling with snow . He saw himself buried amid trees in snow up to his neck . Embarrassing to die so close to the road ; like drowning in a bathtub . Dubin let out a shout for help but the strange cry frightened him , so he sat with hard pounding heart , silent in the still spruce grove . He whispered to himself . What a mad thing to happen . What a fool I am . It was the having I wanted more than the girl . Who is she to me ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've done to myself . I 'm like a broken clock  --  works , time , mangled . What is life trying to teach me ? The woods were growing dark . He sat unable to decide whether to stay longer under the trees ; wait the storm out . Suppose it snowed till nightfall and throughout the night until morning  --  Dubin frozen stiff , snowman . Death 's scarecrow . He heard a sudden heavy plop in the branches overhead and cried out as lumps of snow showered on him . His first wild fear was that a bobcat had seen and leapt at him . But when the powdery mist settled he beheld a hook-nosed white owl perched on a swaying branch over his head staring at him through the leathery slits of its cold blinking eyes . But the owl as if frightened by Dubin flew off into the wind-driven snow with a hoot and great flapping of its long wings . It disappeared into the trees . Dubin rose to his knees , crawled out from under the spruce , walked into an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently . It was now more than a foot deep , deeper in drifts . He floundered around the fringe of a stand of bleak ash trees . Two of them had fallen . Dubin picked his way over the fallen trees . Through the brush ahead he made out a snow-covered stone wall about a foot higher than those he had already encountered . Separating him from what fate ? He was cruelly fatigued ; could barely keep his eyes open . He sawp153himself lying in the snow . Then he climbed the wall because it was the next thing to do . Dubin lifted himself over the rock wall . He found himself wandering on the recognizable road ; assumed he had crossed and recrossed it . The narrow road had been plowed , plowed narrowly , though he had n't heard the truck go by . Since then another two inches of snow had fallen , but there were earth-streaked mounds of plowed-up snow banking both sides of the road , and he felt with relief that he could easily follow it . Yet snowflakes continued to pelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; was still not sure which was the way to go . It begins again : which is the nearest way to the highway ? What side of the road did I go off ? Where did I come out of the field ? Did I cross the road without knowing it ? Why is it I do n't remember the high stone wall I just climbed ? Has it always been there and I have never noticed , or have I seen it but am too frightened to remember ? Is this the long hard-topped road I usually walk , or have I gone somewhere I have never been before ? It must be more than a secondary road or they would n't have plowed it so soon . Unless a farmer cleared his own access road and I am on it ? If so where does it go ? Is there a farmhouse or barn nearby ? He saw no light . Now how shall I go ? Am I already into the turn of the road , thereforehead west , then south and I hit the highway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to sight a house in twenty minutes ; unless I do n't . Dubin turned left where he had been standing at the wall and after tedious and forgetful walking , as dusk grew darker , he was convinced he was on the right road plodding the long but wrong way back . Wrong because long . He stopped , deathly wearied , trying again to decide whether to go the other possibly shorter way . He was dully cold , his clothes wet , face stiff , hands and feet freezing . His back teeth ached with cold . The wind had died down and it was beginning to rain as well as snow . He could feel the icy rain through his soaking hat and see it snowing . Dubin trudged on . After a white wet timeless time it seemed to him something was approaching , a truck , or car , its wheels churning in the slush , brights on , wipers flapping as it loomed up like a locomotive out of the raining snow . The biographer flailed both arms , frantically waved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It then shot through his frozen head that the white-faced woman ,  |p154her  head wrapped in a black shawl , who sat stiffly behind the wheel , peering nearsightedly through the fogged windshield ; frightened , perhaps already mourning , was his wife . Kitty held the door open as Dubin numbly got in beside her . " I saw a white owl . " Crying silently , she drove him home.  |p155Kitty  's old friend , Myra Wilson , died in her farmhouse of heart failure . She knew she was dying but would not be moved to a hospital . She died a week after her seventy-ninth birthday , a woman more vital than her body permitted . She had rarely mentioned her age or ailments . In her presence Kitty spoke little of hers . Myra would kiss Dubin mouth to mouth when they met , a way she saw herself . Kitty had wired her daughter that her mother was dying and wired again the next morning to say she was dead . Mrs. Meyer flew in from Milwaukee late in the afternoon . With Kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a restrained bulky woman in a brown felt hat and black cloth coat . She was about Kitty 's age but looked older . Her right eye was tearing  --  the effect , she said , of a cold . She stayed with the Dubins for two nights and was restless to be home with her family . " Mr. Meyer said Mama could live with us , " she told them . " She had her choice . " Her youngest child was a boy of thirteen . The girls were nineteen and twenty-four . " My daughteris nineteen , " Dubin told her . " Twenty , " Kitty said . " She was twenty in October . " Dubin felt he had misplaced a year of Maud 's life . There were eight at the graveside : the Methodist minister ; Kitty and Dubin ; Flora Greenfeld , moody handsome lady  --  Oscar was on a concert tourp156in Australia ; Ursula and Fred Habersham ; Craig Bosell , carpenter and handyman , who had looked after the house and barn for Mrs. Wilson ; and there was Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It snowed at the graveside . It snowed lightly into the open grave . As the casket was lowered and the prayers recited , Kitty wept brokenly . Mrs. Meyer darted her a startled glance and wiped her wet eye with a handkerchief . Kitty tried to suppress her sobs , squirmed , bit her lip , but could n't stop . She walked away from the grave and sat in the car . Dubin , when the ceremony was over , drove her home . " I could n't help it , " Kitty said . Mrs. Meyer telephoned them from the Wilson farmhouse . She was shuttingup the place and would return in the spring , " Your mother was a courageous woman living alone in that big house , I could n't have done it , " Kitty said . " She did n't have to but that 's the nature she had . " Mrs. Meyer delivered the farmhouse keys to Kitty in case someone had to get in . " Bosell is closing the house , " she said . " He 's drained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll lock the doors and shutters . There 's no stock left in the barn or henhouse and the dog she had ran away . " Kitty regretted it . " I should have remembered Ben . " " When I come back in the spring I 'll put the place up for sale . We sold off seventy acres after Pa died . Now there are twenty-four left , and the house , barn and henhouse . Thanks kindly for your kindness and consideration to Mama and me . " " Myra was a favorite of mine . " Kitty quickly turned away . Mrs. Meyer left for Milwaukee . " Why am I always crying ? " Kitty asked Dubin . He praised her generousnature while disliking her for outdoing Mrs. Meyer at the graveside . Kitty , after mulling it awhile , had quit her job at the library . Dubin hadurged her not to , but she said she had to think of Roger Foster : he neededa professional librarian who could work full-time . " I 'm no great help to him . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did he say to you ? When did he say it ? " " He said you were doing a very good job or words to that effect . I met him by chance on a walk in town . " " What else did he say ? " she spoke casually , studying him . Had Roger mentioned Fanny ? Was Kitty alluding to her ? " Nothing I can recall , " Dubin said.  | " I quit because the work was becoming a bore , " Kitty said , looking bored . " I 'd rather give you the time I gave them . " Dubin said she gave him as much time as he needed . He spoke gently and she was gentle with him . Her first morning as housewife resumed she spent showing the new cleaningwoman , a bulky French-Canadian of fifty-five , how she liked things done . Kitty also sewed on the sewing machine , typed and filed recipes she had torn out of newspapers and magazines , arranged and catalogued their old travel slides  --  Dubin often studied the villas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote letter after letter , some of which she tore up and at once rewrote . " I owe to everybody , especially the kids . " She started something new with a burst of energy . She had begun a reading project : to read a book on contemporary philosophy and all of Jane Austen . She had never read Lawrence 's poetry or Thoreau 's Cape Cod , which she thought she would do . Shortly after leaving the library she suffered a spell of indigestion and for a while was worried about her health . " I 've not been feeling well . My color has been poor for weeks . You do n't think there 's anything wrong , do you ? " She was nervous and pale , her eyes troubled . He did n't think so . " You 're on edge about something . Just watch your diet . That usually does it for you . " She said she would . When the indigestion disappeared so did her worries about cancer . She kept busy and had few complaints . Once more Kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pit of night , but she would come down in her robe for coffee with Dubin if she was not sleeping when he rose at some outrageously early hour . Afterward she got back into bed . She still experienced flashes of feeling hot and cold . When she was hot her face looked as though she had just stepped out of a hot shower , or was deeply blushing . She blushed scarlet ; so did Maud . When Kitty felt cold she raised the thermostat and went to her dresser for a sweater . She was not content when she looked at herself in the mirror . Recently while standing without clothes in front of the full-length glass in the bedroom , she had touched her hair , then lifted her breasts and said , " Do n't you think I look reasonably young for my age ? " She confessed , " I 'm mourning my losses . If only one could get used to it . But one does n't . I see it so clearly , the loss of my looks . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I were , she was thirty-eight . " " You do n't look your age . You 'd easily pass for forty-five . " " I would n't , " she said . " I do n't think I would . I 'm fifty-one and look every bit of it . " He left her standing sadly naked before the glass . It was a long white winter  --  leaden skies broke , spilling snow endlessly on snow . Sometimes it snowed lazily half the day , sometimes savagely for a day or two in flowing waves of white . The biographer stood at his window watching the snowflakes flying , white curtain lowered , ending no play , beginningnone . When it stopped snowing for several days , or a week , the scene , the drama , was the endless white world mournfully searched by an eyeless wailing white wind . The monochrome white dulled the mind , restricted movement , experience . Yet the roads were continually plowed , salted , sanded ; and Dubin , heavily coated , scarved , booted , against the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow-rutted roads . The temperaturerarely rose above zero . The stringy willows in the dead fields were a greenish mustard-yellow . Pines and bent spruce bristled with icicled snow . Once as he tediously walked  --  it seemed to him nowhere  --  he plunged into a snowy field up to his gut and waited for his life to change . The long walk-run was still routine . He had fitted himself for the task : you did it daily and therefore could do it . The experience proved you could . He was compelling a willed experience to contend with another , unwilled , that lingered . But as soon as it became easier to do , the wind , freezing cold , and the icy earth , made it harder to do . If you stopped for a single day , much you had accomplished  --  at last got used to  --  you had to accomplish again . For two days at the end of the month the temperature rose and it rained steadily , drearily , foggily ; then the weather again turned frigid , the snow stiffened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . There was a week of twenty below , two awesome days of thirty below . The rumbling clanking snowplows only thinly shaved the stony ice-ruts on the road . Dubin gave up the long walk , against the insatiable will . Now when he left the house he picked his way along the glistening slippery ice only to the covered bridge and back . Even a mile seemed a mad thing to do . People offered rides and shook their heads when he waved them off . They sensed his creation : his trial.  |p159The  radio called it a hard winter . It was desolate ; and in his study the windows were frozen over . Icicles hung from the deep eaves of the roof and grew thick and long . One long icicle was a four-foot spear before it broke in sunlight and crashed below . Kitty was sick of being housebound . " Let 's , for God 's sake , get away to a warm place . We 've never been to the Caribbean . What have you got against a warmer climate ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go alone , do n't ask me to . Let 's both go for a week . I 'm married to you , not your book . I want to be free of it . " " You are free of it . " " I want you to be . " He had to hang in . She thought , he guessed , that he might be getting back to work and said no more about going away . Dubin kept to his room for long hours each day , letting her think what she might be thinking . He let her think so but sat at the desk reading . He read one biography after another , famished for lives . From his window he watched the sunset reflected on the nearby hills . As the winter sky darkened the hills were suffused in rose , lilac , mauve , and these colors , in contrast to freezing daylight , seemed warm , warming the bluishgrayoutcroppings on Mt . No Name . One evening the icy mountain blazed in rose flame . From this illusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the promise of spring . Had n't Thoreau said the mind was the only stronghold against winter : it could , at least , anticipate spring . Good , but not if spring held out to the end of spring : it shunned the anticipating mind . The outside thermometer read six below and winter had far to go before it yielded to reason or mercy  --  or to the thunder of the wheeling earth : through February and March into the teeth of cold April . In the Northeast , at the thin edge of New England , it sometimes snowed on the flowers of May . If spring comes can spring be far behind ? Anticipation admits there is tomorrow , not much more . Kitty , nursing a cold , was too restless to stay in bed . She wandered in the house , straightening things : ashtrays , vases , flowers . She wiped her oak table . " When I have nothing to do I do everything . " She wore a voluminous robe over her bed jacket and nightgown , and a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to keep her feet warm . In another mood she wore a brown housecoat and silver slender mules ; and a kerchief to warm her head.  |p160Her  hair fell in strands on her shoulders . Colds , she complained , made her hair lank and darkened her complexion . Her nose ran , her eyes were rheumy ; she was like a small animal he could n't name . Kitty pulled up the living-room window and poured sunflower seeds on the bird-feeder shelf , then sat sniffling , sneezing , waiting for a winter bird to appear . After an hour a blue jay landed on the feeder with a thump , saw her watching , and flew off scattering sun seeds . She sat in the kitchen , grooming her housecoat , picking off long hairs . " I seem to be shedding . " She jumped when Dubin coughed , then apologized for being startled . She sighed restlessly , seemed someone 's lost self  --  his fault , he thought . Dubin was burdened by his lack of affection ; knew she felt it . The telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice said , " Why do n't you go get yourself fucked ? " Kitty flung the phone against the wall . Sometimes when she answered the ring the telephone clicked off . She gave up a call reluctantly . " Hello , hello , " she called . " Hello !  --  Hello ! " she insisted to the telephone . " Who are you trying to hear from ? " " That 's a stupid thing to say . " One night she waked from a dream and woke Dubin to tell it to him . She said she would not have minded his waking her . " I dreamed I was menstruating again . I was flowing profusely and was frightened . I said in my dream , William , what shall I do , I 'm bleeding so heavily ? ' And you impatiently said , Cut it out ! ' " " I apologize , " said Dubin . " Now let me sleep . " " I 'm burning tonight , " Kitty sighed five minutes later . " Is the house overheated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind will blast us out of bed . " She turned on her bed lamp and changed , panting , from a white flannel nightgown to a pink sheer sleeveless one ; then fell instantly asleep , while he remained awake thinking useless thoughts until the alarm rang in the dark and he groped his way to the shower . " Drop dead ! " She woke . " Who ? " " Nobody you know . " " I 'll bet I do . " " I spoke to the mirror , do n't take credit . "  | " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , the goddamned things you say . " In the bathroom she gargled loudly , ferociously cleared her throat , coughed on and on . He could hear her in his study . She discovered a large black moth on the wall and socked it relentlessly with a rolled-up towel . Kitty misplaced her diary and asked Dubin whether he had seen it . It was an on-and-off affair in a spiral notebook , rebegun recently in black ink . When they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he occasionally glanced into it when she was n't around . He felt she left it in sight so he could read what she wanted him to know , but would rather not talk about . A diary was a punitive instrument . She had begun a book on modern philosophy and after twenty pages set it aside . That afternoon she drove to Winslow to shop for a dress . She could n't find one she wanted and drove to Albany . There she bought a pair of shoes and a green dress . She returned the dress the next morning . " Green offends me , " she said to Dubin . He had said he did n't care for the dress . She kept the cross-strap elegant black shoes . She had also tried on several hats , but none suited her . Sometimes she bought things to return them . That night she informed Dubin she had been seeing Evan Ondyk . " Not about you , " she said uneasily . " About myself . " He knew why but asked anyway . She said nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she talked . " Since Myra 's funeral I have n't felt right . You remember I could n't stop crying at the cemetery ? A sense of loss has stayed with me . " Dubin remembered . " Since then I 've been thinking of my life  --  with you , and with Nathanael . That seems to be starting again , though I have n't done it in years . " " You were dreaming of him last summer . " " Not as often as I used to . I have no intense feelings about him , but he 's still a familiar stranger who keeps standing on the street corner , expecting me to come over and say hello . I remember the most trivial things of our life together , for instance buying him a pair of tennis sneakers one Saturday afternoon while we were out wheeling Gerald in his carriage . Is n't it strange the way we 're constituted  --  I mean about the past ? Jesus , why are we ? " He felt again as though he had married her marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , Gerry as a baby , Dubin had felt a sense of being out of it ; he no longer felt that . " Do n't make too much of it , " he said.  | " I honestly do n't want to , but certain things keep bothering me . I do n't mean Nathanael . Now I think of Myra alone in that empty farmhouse and I scarcely gave her the time of day . " He reminded her she had visited the old woman almost daily . " When you could n't you telephoned . Sometimes you 'd shop for her in the morning and also call at night . " " I could have done more for her when she was sick . She was alone too often . And I feel terrible about Ben running away . I should have paid attention to him . " Dubin thought it might have been better if she had n't given up the library job . " At least it got you out of the house half the day . " " Lay off about that job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like it if I was never in the house . " He denied it . " All you want is to be alone . If I died you 'd get along very well without me . " " I 'd want you to get along without me . " " I hate your beastly love of solitude . " She had again been playing the harp . Kitty pulled the gilded frame down on her shoulder , pressed her feet on the pedals , and began to pluck the strings , her hands moving like birds flying at each other . When she sang in a soft mezzo her singing voice was small . One day she played for hours and whatever she played  --  Chopin , Schumann , Hugo Wolf  --  sounded lonely . The next day she played as though she were in love or wanted to be ; and wanted him to know . He heard the harp as he sat upstairs at his desk , and found it impossible to read . She never played while he was at work . Dubin was angered , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet as he listened to her playing he felt the possibility of life with feeling . He thought , as he listened , of meeting someone with whom he might fall in love , a woman of thirty perhaps . He wanted another chance in marriage ; he could do it better than he had done it . And he 'd be his bride 's first husband . Kitty tore the strings into a reverberant jangle , then went out for a drive . When she returned she gaily told Dubin that a young man had tried to pick her up in the parking lot of the supermarket when she came out with her bundle of groceries . " He had a heavy mustache and wore bell-bottom trousers . He looked like a New York actor , " she laughed.  | " What did he say ? " " He called me Cutie and asked me to come for a ride . I said I had a ride and took off . He knew I could see through him . " She then regretted her nature . " I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away much of her life . " I find it distressing not to be better pulled together at this time of my life . I should have done more for myself and not depended so much on my husbands . I 'm upset about your problems and the way we are . I 'm also upset because I feel I 've been a lousy mother , or my kids would write once in a while . I 'm tense about Maud coming home  --  if she ever does . " She approached a mirror to look at herself and turned quickly away . She went into the kitchen to brew herself a cup of tea and deeply breathed above the burners before setting down a pot and lighting the gas . The next morning she misplaced her wedding ring . " I ca n't find it anywhere , it 's lost . " It was an inexpensive thin band . She had always liked its design , its simplicity . Kitty could not find it after taking her shower and spent the morning grimly going from room to room  --  unmaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opened drawers , stood on chairs searching closet shelves , feeling along every inch . In the afternoon when after an hour 's restless rest she went on relentlessly looking , Dubin offered to buy her a new wedding ring if this did n't turn up . " I want my old ring , " said Kitty . " It took you a month to find the one you wanted . It was your first real present to me . " She went on vigorously searching and at last found the ring in a plastic glass in the bathroom . " Bravo , " said Dubin . They faced each other in hatred . Maud Dubin , who had come home only for short stays last year , appeared at the house in early February , her beautiful long red hair shorn and dyed black . Her brows were lined black . Her light eyes seemed to have darkened . " Maud , for God 's sake ! " Dubin cried . Her eyes appealed to him not to say more . He momentarily turned away , then put his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an attempt at casual talk , trotted up the stairs . For a while he stood at his study window watching the leafless swaying trees in the windswept field near the side of the old barn . In ten minutes he trotted down once more to greet his daughter , butp164Maud had called a friend and had driven off in Kitty 's car . Dubin stared out of his window . She 'd kissed full on the lips as a child , it was her way . She gave feeling so naturally he thought he had earned it . Maud had a raucous laugh and high voice and seemed a little girl until she opened her mouth and spoke in full sentences . She grew according to his vision of what she must ultimately be . Maud resembled Kitty more than Dubin although her red hair derived from his mother , whom he rarely remembered as other than gray-haired . Charlie had told him that as a girl she had a deep-red head of hair . " So people came miles to look on her . " Maud 's bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted her a white wool hat with a blue band that she wore for years in and out of the house . One night Dubin entered her room as she slept wearing her hat . As he tried to remove it she had lifted her warm arms and held him in sleep . At fifteen Maud plaited her long hair into a pigtail ; and when her father heard the front door shut in the morning he would put down his razor and go to the bedroom window so he could watch her on the back lawn striding along in brown boots , white hat , blue coat , the wooden-barretted pigtail swinging as she sturdily walked toward the woods on the way to the bus stop at the covered bridge . He would sometimes stand in her room after she had left for school , or was away for the summer , to reflect in it , reflect on her . He would look over her books , surprised by some he had given her . He liked the many volumes of poetry she had collected ; her small desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft-yellow room ; throw rug on the floor ; colored pictures of savage and saint taped on the wall above her head . Dubin looked out of her windows to see what she saw . She was a handsomelanky active girl  --  swam , backpacked , skied  --  with a slender firm body that grew lovely , after a crisis of fat , as she matured . She had a quiet handsome face with light-blue eyes , uneven lips  --  they were Dubin 's  --  and a small bony chin . Maud had unexpected qualities and did unexpected things . By Kitty 's edict she was Jewish and she called herself a Jew . Kitty had said , " There are only five in town and no house of worship , how can she learn ? " but Dubin said , " If she thinks of herself as Jewish let 's see what she makes of it . " Her parents ' marriage had been best to her teens ; she knew when it was at its less than best . Though Gerry , in his private world , had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among her own , apparently , was a curious impatience with childhood . She seemed to want to live life in contravention of time  --  before it permitted . Whatever you 're running after , her father thought , wait a bit , it 'll catch up with you . " What 's her hurry for experience ? " he asked his wife . " I was never like that , " Kitty said . " I played with dolls long past the time she 'd given them up . Maybe she 's read Short Lives ? " She had , in fact , years ago . Maud had departed her room and house in what had hardly seemed sufficient time . After going away to Berkeley she returned comparatively infrequently . She had spent one summer on a dig in Mexico . Another , she worked as a professor 's research assistant . She preferred to work when she could , earn part of her keep . " Not that I do n't miss you but there 's a lot to see and get done . " Dubin saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why should you be gone so long so often ? " " It 's not as though I 'd left the house , if I keep coming back . " She said in afterthought : " I think of you both a lot . " Perhaps she shared his hunger to live many lives ? In imagination he lived hers . She had eased in him a wanting of much he had n't had as boy and youth . Kitty , it seemed to him , had loved him in part for his love of the girl . Dubin was disheartened that he had only this ragged self to offer on her short visit home . And that Maud had appeared almost unrecognizable , the fiery flame of her dyed black . She had walked into the house masked . What is she hiding ? Had she seen him , after all , with Fanny in Venice ? Had it been she in the gondola with the old man ? Who is she , nervously clumping around in boots and poncho , who comes as my child , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other , who were once so much more than we presently are ? When they were alone during the evening after her arrival , Dubin asked his daughter why she had dyed her hair black . She answered , " Because I 'm me " ; then said , " I wanted to see how I look in black hair , I know how I look in red . " " How do you look in black ? " She was for a moment uneasy . " Pretty much as I expected . " " Could n't you have imagined it ? " " I 'm not good in imagining . I 'm good in seeing . "  |p166He  said he sensed a symbol in her mask . " This sort of thing a bit extended could hurt you . " She was annoyed . " Please do n't read symbols in everything I do , Papa . I 'm not a book . And if I 'm masked I 'm not the only one . " " Am I ? " " Maybe . Anyway , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " He called it an occupational problem . " If you want a symbol , be satisfied with something simpler  --  maybe somebodylooking for herself . " Dubin therefore apologized . He recalled , the week she was there , other dissatisfactions of hers : she had , for instance , from childhood , complained about her name . Kitty had suggestedher own grandmother 's name  --  Christina  --  for her , which Dubin had doubted . After considering Crystal they had settled on Maud , later discoveredit derived from Magdalene ; but Maud was by then Maud . Her middle name was his mother 's , Hannah . Who 's in a name ? " Maud , Maud , the birds cawed , " she had parodied Tennyson when she was in high school . " Boy , what a jackass name . " " On you it sounds good . " " It sounds like a cow call . I 'm maudlin is what it amounts to . In grade school the kids made it Muddy ' and now all I hear is Moody . ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She laughed at that . Once as he followed her on a trail in the woods , she complained , " Too many of my habits are like yours . " Dubin would not apologize . " You were always yawking about work , going to bed early so you could be early to work  --  all that sort of thing , and it took me years before I stopped being afraid to waste time . " " Waste what you want , " he said . " I do what I have to . If Mark Twain had applied himself to his writing instead of piddling time away trying to make money on things that did n't work , he 'd have been a greater writer . F. Scott Fitzgerald , before he caught himself near the end , had wasted much of his talent . I 'm telling you what I learned from their lives . " She laughed scornfully . " Why did n't you learn about some of the fun they had , especially Fitzgerald ? "  | " Someone once said , no valuable work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maud bet it was Thoreau . " I 'm sick of him . Also it depends what you mean by valuable . " Dubin said one had to make choices . " I 'm trying to , " she shouted . He remembered having run over her black-and-white cat in the driveway and hastily burying the animal before she could see its maimed body . When he told her later what he had done she was inconsolable he had n't given her the kitty to bury . He sometimes felt she had never forgiven him . One day she had accused him of having favored Gerald over her . He told her not to believe it . She reddened , yet insisted it was true . " He was the interesting one you were always going up to talk to , and I was fluff and yum-yum . " She complainedhe had never really understood her . Dubin looked at her to see if she was kidding ; she was n't . It hurt . He thought he had communicated with her better than with almost anyone . Another illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antagonism in her without being able to define it more than generally . Perhaps she had changed faster than he had imagined ? It happens so quickly with kids . While I was out for a walk she became someone else . " You were a good enough father , " she once defined it , not noticing the tense or qualifier . " You cared and provided but we could have been closer as a family . " " Propaganda  --  we were close and attentive to each other . " " Not that close . " Who remembered better ? Close ? He sometimes thought his life had pressed hers too strongly . He was too intensely aware of Maud , had made her self-conscious . He wondered what kind of father he had been . A decent one , Dubin had thought , but who was he to say ? God , the impression one made without knowing it . What had he ultimately given them ?  --  Much willingly but they made unconscious choices from his daily offerings  --  or non-offerings , simply being who or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never be able to use . The father of Maud 's childhood and Gerald 's , being in essence little known to them , ultimately a mystery because other  --  love to the **27;6174;TOOLONG  --  had left his mark as mythological father ; but the historical Papa they had discovered and felt some affection for as they grew was , as self , recognizable , measurable , predictable , vulnerable . They knew reasonablywell his strengths and limitations and sensed how they themselves were bound by them . By definition he ' was as parent  --  more than Kitty  --  the opposing self ; and in subtle ways they opposed him . They opposed him best by changing .  --  Ah , fooled you ! Overnight , it had seemed , they had changed and gone , each to pursue an unpredictable destiny .  --  Who would have thought so , contemplating them as kids ? Yes , you said love , they said love , but each lived a world apart . They saw him differently as they changed , and against the will he was a changed man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been himself to them , defined himself as he was ; and they would therefore , sooner or later , return to claim his friendship . But either they had n't listened , or had and forgot ; or had n't he spoken ? Yet every so often the father had the feeling he had lost or misplaced his daughter at a specific time in another country , a foreign experience . Had he , indeed , lost her in Venice , although he did not , in truth , know whether she 'd ever been there ? Kitty , after a quiet devastation over the dyed hair , had revived her good spirits in Maud 's presence . " She 's home rarely , let 's not be so critical of what she did . She 's been a good kid . " She and Maud had got along well . Kitty admired her good looks , independence , sense of adventure ; she wished she had been similarly endowed . Maud respected her mother 's taste and strength . Kitty pooh-poohed " strength " but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with your doubts . " Kitty looked emotionally away . Now they were shopping together , Maud mostly to please her mother because she wanted no more than a pair of bluejeans and two pairs of socks . And Kitty loved cooking for Maud though she had asked her to go easy . " I 'm into organic foods and brought a batch with me . " " Then let 's cook them up , " said Kitty . Maud laughed till it hurt . About her dyed hair Kitty said to Dubin , " It 's not forever , the black will grow out . " " What have you told her about me ? " he asked . " I 'd rather she did n't know what a mean winter I 've had . " " She always complained we keep secrets from them . " " There are some things I 'm entitled to keep private . " " I 've told her nothing she would n't guess on laying eyes on you . "  |p169He  asked her what . " I said you were having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve pounds on your diet  --  was that all right ? " He thanked her . Maud went to see a high school friend living with an unemployed mechanic in a shack up the side of Mt . No Name . They had rapped about Eastern religions . She had also cross-country skied with Roger Foster  --  Kitty 's dubious arrangement ; Dubin had , as usual , his doubts about the librarian . And Maud was restless , prowled around the house ; tightened water taps ; lowered the thermostat if Kitty permitted ; convinced her mother to use cloth napkins instead of paper . " We have got to save trees , Mother . " She spent hours looking through things in the attic , searching for something she could n't find . One morning when Dubin came downstairs , Maud was eating a granola she had mixed of rolled oats , wheat germ , sesame seeds , other ingredients . Formerly she had eaten a soft-boiled egg almost every morning of her life . The world had changed . He pictured her with red hair . She studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her her gaze shifted . Dubin asked her if she had heard from Gerry lately . " A card . He 's working on an excursion boat . He 's moved , I think . " " Again ? " " He can move if he wants . " Her voice wavered angrily . " What 's with you ? " She filled her teacup . " Why did you walk away from me the minute I came into the house , Papa ? " He said her black hair had upset him . " I sensed you had changed in a way that excluded me . I guess I did n't want you to see how bad I felt . " " Are you used to me now ? " He said a stupidity had got into him ; he regretted it . She rose , washed the cup and cereal bowl in the sink , then sat down and lit a cigarette . She eats health foods then smokes , Dubin thought . " Just one , " Maud said . " It 's snowing , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love winter . I do n't think I want to spend my life in California . " That seemed good news . Dubin imagined her home again : they were sitting at this table talking and Maud had red hair . " You have n't said what 's been happening to you . " " Not much . " She listened to herself say that , then put out her cigarettep170and said , " Not very much . " After a moment Maud asked him if he would like her to recite a poem . She often recited to him poems she had learned . Once she had tried to write verse but had given it up , though he had asked her not to . She said they were n't very good poems ; and sounded like Kitty . Maud recited gravely , her voice expressive , face softened , seriousness deepened : O Thou whose face hath felt the Winter 's Wind , Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in mist , And the black elm-tops ' mong freezing stars , To thee the spring will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She went on , ending : " To thee the spring shall be a triple morn . ' " He thanked her for her kindness . " Do you remember reading me Bright Star ' after I had read about Keatsin Short Lives ? " He remembered . Keats spoke in youth 's voice and Dubin had listened with youth 's ear . She seemed gently embarrassed . Each then left the room . Dubin worked upstairs for a while . The snow had stopped and it was white and still outside . He knocked on Maud 's door and asked her to walk to the bridge with him . They trudged along the snowy road , Maud in ski pants and boots , wearing a white padded parka . Dubin had on his black galoshes and red wool hat . As they stood under the snow-covered bridge , resting , their white breaths intermingling , Maud quietly began another sonnet of Keats ' . It was " To Fanny . " She spoke the poem feelingfully . That warm , white , lucent , million-pleasured breast ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Withhold no atom 's atom or I die , Or living on perhaps , your wretched thrall , Forget , in midst of idle misery , Life 's purposes ,  --  the palate of my mindLosing its gust , and my ambition blind !  |p171His  voice was heavy when he asked her why she had recited that particular poem . " I loved it when I was sixteen . " " So you recite it now ? " " I just thought you might be in a mood to hear it ; I am . " " It 's appropriate , " he offered . " It helps . " " Helps what ? " " My mood . " He thanked her for the poem . " Mother says you 're having trouble with your work ? " Dubin confessed he had been writing without authority . " Do you really like Lawrence ? You 're not much like him . " " I like him well enough ; he 's an interesting man . Not all his books are good , some are very good . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life though he explained it insufficiently . " " But is n't it hard for somebody like you to write about somebody like him ? " " Nobody I 've written about is like me though they all are . " " Are n't some more congenial than others ? I do n't think you had much trouble with Thoreau . " " He came at a better time . " " Why did you pick Lawrence to write on ? " " He picked me . There 's something he wants me to know . " After studying him a minute , she said , " You 've had bad periods before . You 'll soon be back into your rhythm of work . " " It 's been a long time . " The next morning at breakfast Maud said she had learned her first poem by D. H. Lawrence . She recited it with eyes closed . Desire may be deadand still a man can bea meeting place for sun and rain wonder outwaiting painas in a wintry tree . She treats me with poetry , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p172He  worked in his study later in a calm mood . On Friday of the week Maud was home , as they were again returning from the short walk , he considered telling her what had happened to him in Venice . He had wanted to all week . Dubin said his trouble with work had started after an experience there . " What kind of experience ? " " Unexpected . I thought I was fairly good facing up to what happens unexpectedly , but apparently less than I thought . " He did not elaborate ; she did n't ask him to . As he was following her along the path through Kitty 's Wood Dubin stopped and said , " Maud , I love you . " She turned to him . " I love you . " " I love you more than anyone . " " Papa , " Maud said , " I 'm not your wife . " Dubin said he had n't asked her to be . " You neglect Mother . She 's lonely . " " It 's a long story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You 're my daughter , I need you . Let 's stay more closely in touch . " " You have me . " They embraced on the path in the white wood . Maud kissed him quickly . Though he had warned himself not to , Dubin asked her if it was she he had seen with an old man in Venice . " Please do n't ask me questions like that . " The next day Maud flew back to California . One freezing night Dubin drove through the white silent streets to Oscar Greenfeld 's . He had had to get out of the house , could not stand being alone with Kitty . Flora had called a week ago . She said she had wanted to talk with himabout a book she was reading , but they had never got to it . On the phoneDubin was n't sure what they were talking about . Oscar was in Europe . " Are you all right ? " he had asked Flora . " More or less . Listen , William , " she said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better friends . " " How would that work ? " Flora hung up on him.  | " Who was that ? " Kitty had asked . She 'd been in the bathroom . Dubin rarely answered the telephone ; it was her instrument . " Flora . " " What did she want ? " " She wanted to talk about a book she was reading . " " What book ? " He said he had forgotten to ask . " I think she 's been lonely since she 's given up traveling with Oscar , " Kitty said . " I had that feeling when I saw her at Myra 's burial . " " Should we invite her over ? " " If you want . " " You do n't want ? " " God knows I 've tried , but I simply do n't take to her . " That very cold night , a week after Flora 's call , Dubin parked his car in the driveway by the birch trees , and rang her bell . " What a nice thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong time to come ? " She insisted it was n't . Flora was wearing a tight pleated white blouse and a long burgundy skirt . Her voice was chesty , throaty , musical . She said Oscar was in Prague . " Are you dressed to go out ? " " I dress to practice . " She took up her bow and went on with a Bach violin sonata . She played zestfully , a little wildly , her body swaying . The Bach was lively , vibrant , earthy . He had heard her say Bach should not be played like Bach . " He should be played like a gypsy . " Flora then went into the first movement of a Vivaldi violin concerto , playing him like a gypsy . Afterward they sat in silence , he in a rocker by the fireplace , Flora on the sofa . " Were you angry when I hung up on you ? " Dubin said he was n't . She laughed throatily . " Dear William , how little surprises you . Your understanding surpasseth surprise . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes did . " You look low , " Flora said sympathetically . " You looked like hell at your birthday party . "  | " It was Kitty 's party . " " It certainly was n't yours . " " How long has Oscar been gone ? " " Three weeks tomorrow . He 'll be back in a week . " " Why do n't you travel with him any more ? " " Travel keeps me on edge . Besides he 's happy to go alone . " She gazed into the fire . Dubin watched the small flames along the glowing log . " Would you like a drink or what would you like ? " He asked for brandy . Flora poured herself a full glass of red wine . " I hear Maud was home . " " For five days . " " What is she up to besides her Spanish ? " " She did n't say . " " I wish I had a daughter , " Flora said . " I 'd call her every night . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The music was lively , the talk is sad , " Flora said . " Let 's not talk sad , William . Let 's surprise each other joyfully . " She went to her bedroom and returned in a white flowing caftan and jeweled sandals . She had pinned up her hair and her neck was long and lovely . She had light hair and high cheekbones . " Do you know what we 're doing ? " Dubin asked her . " Do n't you ? " " You 're my friend 's wife . " " Your friend is away more than he 's home . We 've not been getting along well . Oscar is an egoist . And I 'm honestly hard up . " " We 've been good friends for years . " " You 're not that much friends nowadays and I 've never been friends with your wife . Come , we 're not children . You and I have touched looks and fingers in many homes . We 've loved each other lightly . Somewhere in a lifetime that calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubin rose . " Not in his bedroom . " Flora led him up to a guest room on the second floor . She removed her caftan and underpants and slid into the bed . Dubin undressed and got in beside her . Flora 's eyes were wet as they kissed . " Bodies are kind , other bodies . Passion is priceless. "  |p175Dubin  said she was kind . Afterward in the quiet dark she asked what he was thinking about . " Oscar . Kitty a little . " " Think of me , " Flora said . " I 'm fifty today . " Dubin , at fourteen , would cross off on the stiff little calendars his father brought home from the Waiters Union the days and weeks of winter . He crossed off the dark days , slush , freeze , rain/snow , wind wailing . One by one he crossed off the icy mornings he dressed in the cold . His mother filled the kitchen stove with balls of newspaper and strips of wood from egg crates Charlie Dubin had got from the grocer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them small shovelfuls of pea coal from the pail on the floor . He would dress fast in front of the tepid stove . As a youth he crossed off loneliness . When will winter end ? When will it go where winters go ? He breathed the January wind , testing it for change , mildness , promise of spring . He was moved by the sight of dead leaves caught in the branches of leafless bushes . He crossed off the cold season as though he were crossing off an unworthy life . In his room he wrote , many times , a single word : " Will i am . " Now , in Center Campobello , he crossed off nothing . If you mangle time it mangles you . Winter , ancient operator , deaf and blind to his mood , lingered long after Maud had gone . The white sky reflected the white landscape . He hungered for change , change of him . But the iron season would not budge . Mornings were still dishearteningly cold . It snowed almost daily in March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow melted for a day or so , then it snowed again although rows of maples along the road already wore spigots over metal buckets , and the sugar house near the bridge was pouring white clouds of sweetish steam from its roof vents . There had been a momentary scent of sap and spring . The snow turned heavy-wet , melting as it touched ground . One day when Dubin awoke it was gone . The next morning it covered woods , hilltops , earth . Again the snow receded , left soiled streaks of white on the hard ground . Except for evergreens the massed bare-branched trees were still winter-gray . The melting snow uncovered meadows wet with grass in soggy clumps and swaths , as though the earth was strewn with soaking rags of brown , yellow , faded-green . After a long rain the bare tree trunks turned brown or black . When the sun reappeared through morning mist some trees flushed rose , some shone an opalescent green . The silver maples , after rain , looked asp176though they were wrapped in wet brown blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the month there were tiny seed clusters on maple branches , but no leaves . It was gently snowing . March he had given up to winter  --  who claimed choice ?  --  but a wintry April tormented him . Yet the frozen dancer invisibly danced . One day he discovered snowdrops amid traces of snow in the woods . The snow vanished in the sun ; earth dried or tried to ; it got to be mud season later than last year . The sun grew stronger daily . On the long walk Dubin saw a darkly plowed field that shone with a greenish cast to its turned soil . Birds appeared in clusters on Kitty 's feeder  --  jays , robins , house sparrows , starlings Dubin recognized ; now and then a purple finch . And when they had flown off a mysterious black-masked loner , a crested red cardinal who had been in and out all winter , popped its beak at grains of corn , stopping as it ate to stare at invisible presences . When a sudden shower struck the earth the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes later they were pecking in greener grass in a soft rain . Then from nowhere  --  from its grave  --  a mournful dark wind arose trailing bleak streamers of snow . Moments later the sun flared in the bright blue sky . Dubin , on Thoreau 's advice , stopped loitering in winter and called the season spring . He felt , oppressively , the need of an action to take . To do something differently  --  create a change that would lead to others . Why had n't he moved beyond the weight of winter ? He was bored sick with expecting something to happen . He felt a hungry need to simplify his life , to see what he could do differently . He felt , before long , the need of a new place to be , observe from , reflect in  --  after the gloom of these past months and his uneasy compromises with Lawrence . Dubin at length decided to move his study from house to small barn , where years ago he had built a room to work in , and for one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the idea of his having another place to work nearby . She had foreseen a time when Maud and Gerald would come for summer visits with their children , who would not have to be quiet , because Dubin was out of the house . When the biographer inspected the study in the barn one day in early April it was damp  --  smelled distantly of silage and manure ; and was abuzz with green-bellied flies that had hatched in the walls . The roof had dripped under the stress of heavy snowfalls , and several feet of top bookshelf were discolored . The smell was dank  --  winter 's corpse . But the electric heatp177worked and soon baked out dampness and attendant odors . A roofer replaced a section of cracked rotting shingles . Dubin killed off the green flies with a spray gun although Kitty had offered to shoo them with a newspaper . He had bought a rectangular pine table for a desk and transported two chairs from the attic room . Kitty gave him a floor lamp she had got as a wedding present when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a bed in case he felt like sleeping out in the heat of summer . She suggested putting in a phone but he resisted : " It costs money . " " Suppose I need you in a hurry ? " " When have you since the kids grew up ? " There was no telephone . Before installing himself Dubin went to the barn in work clothes and galoshes . He swept the study floor and with rags wiped everything within reach . Kitty offered to help but he said he had been wanting for months to do something with his hands . The study was a walled-off quarter of the rear of the barn , a two-windowed room with a long interior wall of shelves halfway to the slanted ceiling . A lavatory with bowl , sink , and a small window had been put in . Dubin lugged boxloads of books across the field in Kitty 's garden wheelbarrow . He enjoyed arranging the books , packets of note cards , folders full of manuscript pages , typed and retyped , on the shelves , carefully putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hung his picture of Thoreau on the wall by the window where the pine table stood , and near the picture , his Medal of Freedom . Kitty hoped he would n't think of this room as his permanent place to work , though she conceded a change might be helpful now ; and Dubin did not tell her that the move had seemed a little like permanently leaving the house . The morning he tried to work he was assailed by the shrilling of birds in the barn . Dubin knew that a family of starlings had been in the eaves inside the barn but there were no signs of nests . They had got in through a missing windowpane , and when he was cleaning the study he drove them out simply by appearing in the barn . He had opened the double doors and the birds rose with short frantic whistlings and whirring of wings , and flew out into the trees . They sat in the high branches shrilling raucously at him . Dubin replaced the pane and kept the barn doors shut . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors ; he heard their noisy chirpingp178when he sat down the next morning . He then nailed a long board to the bottom of the barn door . The starlings , after being driven out again , hung around complaining in nearby trees , then , in a week , disappeared . Kitty called him heartless . It had led to an argument about his character , their life together , who had failed whom . Ten days ago they had been to the Wilson farmhouse with Mrs. Meyer , who had come from Milwaukee to clear out her mother 's effects and put the farm up for sale . Mrs. Meyer had seemed stricken at all that had to be done and Kitty did much of it . She had asked Dubin to go along . While Kitty , in head scarf and coat , and Mrs. Meyer , in her black overcoat and brown hat , in the cold farmhouse , were sorting out and packing into small cartons the old woman 's house dresses , faded underwear and worn shoes , Dubin went through the trunks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-dozen jars of petrified seed , a shoebox full of family photographs , and two bundles of letters , of James to Myra Wilson , and Myra to James , dated around the First World War . Dubin read several of the letters by candlelight . None could be called a love letter . Through the years of marriage they were pretty much the sparse same ; little changed , little grew , little was revealed . Contemplating them Dubin felt tired of marriage , wanted to be alone . Solitude was a clean state of being . He wished he 'd had less of it when he was young and more now . He thought Kitty and he would have got along better if they were with each other less often . They were too intent on what each did and said . Even when they spoke lightly each heard more than was said . Even when you were not saying it you were saying it . You sat there with the self your wife saw , not necessarily the self you were into ; more comfortable with . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided to work in the barn , where he was away from her . One thing that wore on Dubin was the eternal domesticity of Lawrence and his wife . They were almost always together unless Frieda went to Englandto see her children ; or detoured to indulge in a short affair . They rarely stopped traveling . Their way was to rent a villa or cottage for a season or two , move in , wash it down , paint where necessary ; and live tightly and inseparablytogether . Lawrence cooked , scrubbed floors , sewed if he had to . Describinghis intense domestic life wore on Dubin . He brought the letters downstairs to Mrs. Meyer . Kitty , after reading two ,  |p179asked  if she could have them if Mrs. Meyer did n't want them ; and she , with a little laugh , handed both bundles to Kitty . The visit to the farmhouse , especially packing Myra 's clothes , affected Kitty for days after Mrs. Meyer had gone . She was down again , she confessed . " I still feel bad that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dying . " Dubin said , " There are some things one has to forget . " " I ca n't forget . I regret what I should have done and did n't do . And I have the feeling that in her death I am diminished . I 'm afraid I wo n't easily get over this . Oh , why did you ever marry me ? " He advised her to skip that one . " It 's the same useless guilt , " Kitty confessed , " and it bores me stiff . If Myra is in my thoughts , along comes Nathanael to join us . Ah , Nathanael , ' I say , why do n't you go see someone else , please ? My name is Kitty Dubin and I 've been remarried for years to a man who writes biographies , so please leave me alone . ' But he looks at me with his trusting intelligent eyes , the true color of which I am no longer sure of , and seems terribly alone . Then I think of his vulnerable son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , never writing a word , never getting in touch , and I feel a failure at the way I handled him . If I could only shove him up and make him over . " " The same water under the same bridge . Why do you bother ? " " Because I am Kitty Tully Willis Dubin . Because of my stupid nature . Because you know very well why and keep asking me the same stupid questions . Because I feel you do n't love me . " " Resist  --  fight it , for Christ 's sake ! " Dubin was waving his arms . She said quietly , " I do , I am . " Kitty looked into the distance through the window . She seemed someone on an island with no boat nearby . " I 'm seeing Evan , " she said . " He 's helping me . " She began to cry . Dubin put his arm around her and she wept briefly , her head pressed to his shoulder . Let her go to Ondyk , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose and nasally said thanks . The next morning , with a last wheelbarrow-load of books , Dubin completed his move from the house to the barn . He had set his writing table at a window that looked out on a mountain ash . Kitty had offered to make curtains for the windows but he wanted none . As he sat at his table he could see on his left Kitty 's Wood , ragged and sparse after winter , just beginning to be green in spring . He sat alone in the silencep180of the barn and the surrounding land . It was at first oppressive : he did not want this much quiet , so much space for thought . Then he began to enjoy it . And he was on the move again in his work , perhaps even on track ; certainly on the move . Dubin had at last completed the opening section of the biography , to the death by cancer of Lawrence 's mother , and his own illness a year or so after that ; and apparent recovery . Then came the watershed year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creativity , among other things he eloped with Frieda Weekley . He had come to consult his French professor ; she was his wife , mother of three . Lawrence arrived to have lunch , " a long thin figure , " she thought , " quick straight legs , light sure movements , " and in a sense he never left . They took off for the Continent together . David Garnett described him as " a slightly-built , narrow-chested man , thin and tall with mud-colored hair , a small moustache and a hairpin chin . " Frieda was " a noble and splendid animal , " a tall woman , blond , with high cheekbones and goldfleckedgreen eyes . Her movements made you think of a lioness . She had never lived , she once said , before living with Lawrence . She had abandonedhusband and children . They fled to Germany and later lived in Italy . But she mourned her children ; it enraged him . If she loved them she was not in love with him . He wrote a poem , " Misery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She has blues enough to repave the floor of heaven . " " Nevertheless , the curse against you is still in my heart / like a deep deep burn / The curse against all mothers . " But she was present , day and night , and he woke to the beauty of her body and the sensuousdelight and self-celebration it roused in him . " She stoops to sponge , and her swung breasts / Sway like full blown yellow / Gloire de Dijon roses . " He wrote poem after poem and also finished Sons and Lovers . " My detachment leaves me and I know I love only you . " " Frieda and I have struggled through some bad times into a wonderful naked intimacy all kindled with warmth that I know at last is love . " " Look , we have come through ! " They were " two stars in balanced conjunction . " They had lived it well and Dubin was writing it well . Kitty came over to see the furnished study . " It 's grand . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , anything at all ? " He said he would let her know when there was . She then went home ,  |p181|pausing  to ask if he wanted the mail brought over when it came , and Dubin said no . " You used to love to have the mail the minute it came . " " I no longer do . " " I guess I think of the past . " When he was through for the morning she had a light lunch waiting and afterward went to Ondyk , or to work in the Youth Opportunity program in town . Ondyk wanted her to keep busy and had persuaded Kitty to take on a voluntary job three afternoons a ' week . " All I do is type . I wish I could counsel , but I ca n't . Still the cases are interesting . The youth are the maimed . " " What about the middle-aged ? " " The middle-aged are the maimed , " she said . At home she pottered around , played the harp , tried to organize her reading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped into Lawrence'spoems but had found the early ones not to her liking ; she liked some of the love poems , " though it 's his love mostly . " She was occasionally in her garden . The weather was cold . She got down on her hands and knees and weeded a section of the perennial border . Kitty read the newspapers for hours . They went out to dinner to celebrate her fifty-second birthday . The birds , given cold spring , sang in cold trees . Dubin knew the phoebe 's call  --  it sounded like " see-bee " ; blue jay 's aggressive scream ; " tisk " of cardinal , its near voice . He sometimes spied the red bird in the mountain ash . It stayed a minute and flew off . He could afterward hear its shrill whistle , its other voice , in the distance . The cardinal appeared in the mountain ash , barely showing itself , hiding its presence as it hopped on the branch , tisking , trying to have a look at him . Whatever he was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white-blossomed branch of the tree Dubin sensed it was there . One morning he laid out some sunflower seeds , from Kitty 's feeder , on the ledge of the window in front of him . But only when he left the table and stood elsewhere in the room would the cardinal float down . It pecked at the seeds , then flicked its head up , its beady eye watching , until it flew off . Once when Dubin was at work , to his surprise the cardinal flashed down from the tree to peck at the seeds on the window ledge . For an instant he was caught by the bird 's eye , black , mysterious . He marveled at its immaculate beauty.  |p182Where  had it come from ? Why is it so magnificent ? To civilize man to protect the bird ? " Do n't ever die , " Dubin said . The cardinal flew off and he listened for its distant song . He pictured it hidden in the tree in midsummerwhen the berries of the mountain ash had turned orange-red . Dubin became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disturbing memory waiting to occur . Was the red-bearded ghost of D. H. Lawrence , risen in contempt of the biographer 's desecrations of his life , haunting the place to revenge himself ? One day the feeling grew so oppressive he was drawn into the barn to look around . The old barn was dark , gloomy , wet-cold . Dubin , picking up a hammer handle from the floor , went cautiously among the boxes , garden tools and machines , fertilizer bags , the furniture junk there . He found nothing unusual and was about to return to the study when he was struck by the sight of a pair of glowing eyes . He heard a thud and the eyes disappeared . The biographer was momentarily frightened  --  hada wild animal got into the barn ? After a minute of frozen silence he decided it was n't likely ; yet it could be a stray dog or raccoon . He hoped it was not a skunk . As he approached the corner of the barn , still grasping the hammer handle , an animal hissed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheld a long black cat lying on a moldy burlap sack . The cat hissed thickly , then mournfully yowled , but was too sick to move . He considered prodding the animal with the hammer handle , to force it out of the barn . You mean bastard , he thought , the cat 's sick . The black cat got to its feet , its yellow eyes glaring . It snarled weirdly , its matted soiled fur thickened by fear . The cat stank of shit . Bile leaked from its mouth . Dubin went back to his table , found he could do nothing , then left the study , walking across the field to the house . He thumbed through the yellow pages of the phone book and called a vet . He said he had a poisoned cat in his barn . " What can I do for him ? " " If it 's poison , " the vet said , " not much , depending what poisoned him and when . " " Would you want to see the animal if I can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , I handle horses and cows . We had a small-animal man in town but he died last year . "  |p183Dubin  hung up . What was he doing this for ? He had to work . Going back to the barn he poured some water into the tin top of a jar he found . The cat , yowling low in its throat , let him approach but made no attempt to take the water . It coughed sickly , then tried a few licks . The cat choked , coughed hoarsely , then began to vomit , moving backwards as it regurgitated part of a rabbit or bloody rat . Dubin later flashed a light on the mess ; the cat had gorged itself sick . The next morning he went with Kitty to the barn . The black cat was better and lapped a little of the water she gave it . " Do n't feed it anything , William . I 'm pretty sure it will get better by itself and then I 'll hose it to get rid of the smell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled how she had handled the kids when they were sick . She was affectionate and competent and tried not to be anxious . The next day she arrived with some milk in a glass , and a saucer , and brought a box of dry cat food . The black cat lapped up the milk and chewed a little of the dry food . In a week it had recovered . It was a long-bodied lithe almost lynx-like male , with an upright head and twitching tail . Kitty thought they ought to take it to the house . Their old cat had died , but Dubin wanted this one for the barn . He called the cat Lorenzo . At first it showed no affection for him , then began to rub its head against his legs . Sometimes it jumped up and lay in his lap as he sat on the sofa reading . It 's become my cat . He thought of the cats that had come and gone in the family . Lorenzo lived in the barn and roamed the fields . One day it scratched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to his disgust the black cat held a broken-winged bloody cardinal in its mouth . " You bastard . " He tore the red bird from the cat 's jaws . But the cardinal was dead . Dubin drove Lorenzo away . An hour later he went searching for the animal far into his neighbor 's field . Kitty said she had liked helping him with the cat in the barn . " We do so little together . " Dinner was quiet . She seemed like a clock listening to itself . " What would you like us to do that we are n't ? " " I 'd like you to respond to more than my voice . Why do you never think of putting your arms around me without my having to ask ? "  | " Other than that ? " " Other than that , I 'm alone in the house . You live by yourself in the barn . " " I do n't live there . I 'm sorry you feel lonely . It does n't raise my spirits , but at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you ? " " If you are . " " I 'm tired of seeing ' someone . I 'd like not to have to . I 'd like my life to take over . " " Give it time . " " I have . Something 's wrong with the way we live . We take no joy in each other . " " I like the way you look , " Dubin said , trying to take joy . " Often I look at you and like the way you look . " " Thank you . You know what I mean . " " My work is mainly what 's wrong . But I 'm having better days . It 's not easy to see Lawrence whole , but I 'm closer to it . You ca n't explain him till you see him whole . It 's hard to do that , but there are good signs . " " I 'm glad of that . I 'm glad something is good . " Dubin said he was reading a new biography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man than any I 've read , with his neurotic qualities  --  hypochondria , constipation , anxiety , bladder difficulty . I 've told you about his fainting , usually in Jung 's presence . He was tied for half his life in an unexplained triangle with his wife and sister-in-law . But the neurosis , such as it was , led in part to his own self-analysis and thus to his life 's accomplishment . His work shrived him . " " I 'll bet you like that thought . " " Do n't you ? " She admitted she did . " I wish I could work steadily at something I liked . " " Why do n't you ? " " Because I never could . " " Do n't blame yourself , " Dubin said . " For years I never did , now I do . Being home when the children needed me was a time of privilege and grace . Now that they 're grown I wish I had some useful work to do . " After they had gone to bed she was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was early March . "  | " April is March . " He tried to sleep but could n't and felt himself grow worried . Then for a few minutes he fell heavily asleep against Kitty 's warm scented back until she moved restlessly and woke him . The wind had died down . Kitty was sleeping . Dubin , worried about being able to work in the morning if he did not sleep well , got up and dressed in the dark . He wanted a cigarillo but had none and was unable to find Kitty 's cigarettes . From the linen closet he got two sheets and a blanket . Then he returned to the bedroom for a flashlight . Kitty awoke and switched on the bed lamp . She sat up . " What are you doing with those sheets and blanket ? " " I 'm going to the barn . " " What for ? " " To get to sleep so I can work in the morning . I 've got a lot to make up . I need every bit of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much on your nerve . " " I promise to lie very still , " Kitty said . " Or you can go up to Gerald 's room or sleep in Maud 's . Please do n't go to the barn . I wo n't sleep a wink with you gone . Dubin said it would be best if he went . " Why ? " Kitty asked . She was on her knees in bed , in a flowered nightgown . " To be alone  --  I have things to think of . " " I thought you wanted to sleep ? " " That 's what I want to do first . " She said , " I do n't know why you ever got married . " " You know why I got married , " Dubin said . He zipped up his windbreaker , went downstairs , and left the house . The spring night was austerely cold , and the sky , like a lit ceiling that had been lowered , teemed with jeweled stars . It had been a long time since he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubin dropped the sheets and blanket on the sofa . He got out the bag of kibbles and fed Lorenzo , then gave him some water . The cat wanted to stay but he tossed him out and shut the study door . He unfolded the sofa into a double bed and covered it with the sheets and blanket . He had forgotten a pillow and pajamas and lay on his back in his underwear , relieved to be alone . The cat scratched on the door , then gave up . Dubin lay in the dark thinking what he would do in the morning . As hep186was dozing off , a tapping on the window woke him . He listened , wide awake , knew who it was and rose , angered . He flicked on the light . From the sofa he could see her at the window , peering in , her eyes searching , face strained , white . Under his anger he felt concern for her . Dubin got up and let her in , irritated by her appearance , by her constant interference in whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight . She had found her way to the barn by the light of his toilet window until she had got halfway across the field ; then it had gone off . She had fallen once . She was wearing Maud 's old hooded yellow oilskin over her flowered nightdress , wet below the knees . Her bed slippers were soaked by the wet grass . When , after she had tapped on the glass , his light went on , she had looked as though she had n't expected it to . She acted now as if she had never been in this room before . He gave her a towel to wipe her legs . " I had to come , " Kitty said . " The house was beginning to go at me . " He told her to get warm in bed . " I 'm going back to the house . " Kitty looked at him vacantly . " You do n't have to , " she said . " I 'll go back after I tell you what I have to . William , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because of what it came to , which was zilch , but you probably sensed something and it might have made things harder for you than they should have been . I feel ashamed and sorry . " He asked her what she was talking about . Her eyes were restless , dark . her fists tight . " While you were in Italy that week in the fall I had a sudden very brief and unexpected involvement with Roger . I was involved , not he . I think I was momentarily in love with him . I do n't know what else to call it though it came to nothing  --  and I never told him how I felt . If it sounds slightly crazy that 's what it was . " " Roger Foster ? " Dubin said in disbelief . " It was a crazy thing to happen . He 's only a year or two older than Gerald . I felt tender to him . I also felt as though my wits were leaving me . When you came home I wanted to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were depressed , I felt awful . I imagined you had sensed a change in me and were let down  --  perhaps I was foolish , I do n't know . I asked Evan what to do and though he said I was n't what had caused your overwhelming change of mood , my guilt was like salt corroding my thoughts and I knewp187I would have to tell you . I held back until now because the whole thing was senseless and trivial , and I did n't want you to lose respect for me . " " Did you want to sleep with him ? " " I would have . " " But he would n't oblige ? " " I hate the way you distance yourself from me , " Kitty said bitterly . " Why do you put it so meanly ? I said nothing came of it . I told you he never knew how I felt . " " Maybe you should have told him . " Kitty looked at him coldly . " If I should have I did n't . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't about to begin an affair with someone twenty years younger than I by apologizing for the birthmark on my ass and my flabby breasts . " " Did he ever show in any way that he was interested in you ? " " That 's my business . " Her voice wavered . She was n't crying but she looked as though she had cried . One sensed old tears . He thought of his bad time in Venice and felt compassion for her . Dubin then began a story of his own . " Kitty , " he said , " Do n't blame yourself for what happened to me . I made my own misery . I had a girl with me in Venice and it turned out badly . I give her little , she gave me less . There was more feeling in the aftermath . When I came home I wanted to tell you but could n't , partly because I did n't want to hurt you , partly because I was unable to say  --  out of pride  --  what a beating I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had done it badly and I let her . " " I 'm sorry , terribly sorry . " Her eyes were lit with feeling . " I knew something was troubling you but thought I was wrong  --  mixing up my sense of you with what I was feeling . It took me a while to understand how unhappy you were . They went to each other and kissed . " Please let me stay with you tonight , William . " " Stay with me . " " My nightgown is wet . " " Take it off , wear my shirt . " In bed they forgave themselves ; had done it before . That he had told her what had happened in Venice only after she had confessed her feeling for Roger did not seem to bother Kitty , but Dubin regretted he had n't told herp188long ago . They talked into the night , watching the low stars out of the window . " I feel as though we were away somewhere , do n't you ? " Kitty said . " I feel like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faraway country , with cables of stars glowing in the sky . I feel so much relieved . " Dubin said he felt better . " You 're the one I really love , " Kitty said , " though I sometimes feel you ought to have married a different kind of woman  --  someone closer to you in temperament , who might have given you more than I seem to be able to give . Someone less concerned with keeping her own life together . " He said he had never had a better friend . " You do n't always give me what I want but you give . " She laughed embarrassedly . " I wish I had given you more . I wish you had given me what I wanted when I wanted it . Sometimes I wish I could have met you before  --  I mean , instead of  --  Nathanael . " Dubin thanked her . " But I do n't think you would have married me if you had n't been married to him first . You had to have at least a touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could mean something to you . " " What you have to know before you know is hard to understand , " Kitty said . " Maybe I should n't have said that about Nathanael . " " Thanks for thinking it . " They then made love and slept heavily . Dubin felt eased , the self annealed , until he thought of Flora in his sleep and awoke . He felt he ought n't to tell Kitty about her . He would hold it for another time , for Flora 's sake as well as his . Kitty , moving spasmodically in her sleep , opened her eyes . " What do you think was the happiest time of our lives ? " " When we began to know each other , when we were secure in our trust of each other . " " When the kids were young and needed us . I felt used , useful . " " I was completing Short Lives and then did Lincoln and Mark Twain . I was content , and even the lousy things that happened seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tomorrow . " " That 's the time I most remember . " But after lunch that day , perhaps because Kitty had asked him whop189the girl in Venice was and he had n't answered , Dubin told her he had once slept with Flora ; and Kitty , trying to master it in her thoughts , passed out . One Sunday morning in late April Dubin was in a stationery store on Grand Street , picking up his newspaper . As he was fingering an adventurous cigar at the counter , through the window he saw  --  peace to the day  --  Fanny Bick as large as life and enjoying it , across the street with Roger . He had had a recent card from her : the fountains of Rome : " Hi . " The girl , in morning sunlight , was vivid , familiar , as though he 'd been with her yesterday , a sad blow to experience . She had cut her hair ; it fell barely to the shoulders . Dubin saw her without desire or regret , yet envied her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Thinking they might be coming in for a paper , he retreated to the phone on the wall in the rear of the store . But they did not come into the place , had better to do than waste a Sunday morning reading the newspaper . He felt a saddened pleasure in thinking of her . She had joined the mythological types who lived in his mind : she who had deceived his desire , more than desire , a sort of belle dame sans merci , invention of the self intending to treat itself badly . No , he thought , I 'm off that kick . No more slogging in the mud of jealousy ; let me act the age I 've earned . He was well rid of her . After remaining several more minutes at the phone with the receiver held protectively against the ear , Dubin left the store with his newspaper , got into his car at the curb , and lighting the cigar he had bought , drove off . He drove a roundabout way home but to his startled surprise got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amid visions of disaster , to crawl in embarrassment along the outer lane for half a mile , his brights on , horn blasting as the drivers in oncoming cars rushed at him in contempt , fury , or glee , before swerving to the next lane ; until Dubin , ashamed , could at last make a turn between dividers and swing around to the other side of the highway . He went to the barn to calm down before Kitty saw him . He decided he would stay out of downtown until he could be reasonably sure Fanny had left.  |p190Before  returning to the house he wrote to each of his children . " Dear Gerry , we miss you , talk of you often . The amnesty issue is coming up in Congress soon . Where mercy arises in society I ca n't say , but there are good signs . It would n't at all surprise me if an offer of conditional amnesty is made to deserters . If the situation changes , as it may overnight , and you can leave Sweden , why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide your next move ? We 'd all like to see you . I know our relationship is difficult , sometimes no relationship at all , but that can change with good will if we stay in touch . Yesterday need n't be tomorrow . I wish I knew more about your nature but the key to mine , so far as you 're concerned , is that I love you as I did when you were a boy . Your father , William Dubin . " A month later Gerry wrote on a postcard that the U.S. knew where it could shove conditional amnesty . He wanted unconditional amnesty and a public apology . " As for who loved who and when , I never think of it . " Dubin also wrote to Maud . In the late spring she returned home and stayed the summer , a surprise to all . Spring defined itself : present against odds . April rained in May ; the early days poured . On the twelfth of May snow fell on white tulips . Kitty could not get into the soggy garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A flock of glistening wet crows , each a foot long , jabbed at the wet grass . One huge beast flew from a redwing blackbird circling in pursuit in the rain  --  to account for what crow-crime ? A jay , screeching , hit Kitty 's feeder with a seed-scattering bump , scaring flickers , two robins , a grackle . Lorenzo , watching from inside , threw up his breakfast . After mid-month the rain rained lightly . May showers brought May flowers : yellow troilius , feathercuspedred tulips , iris , white and purple ; dandelions were scattered in the fields , buttercups ; a blue haze of forget-me-nots ; golden mustard in the green grass . In Kitty 's Wood there were violets . The grass , come to life , thickened quickly . Dubin raked away last year 's dead leaves from under trees and bushes . The new leaves had , on the thirtieth of April , burst forth like light-green lace on bony fingers . The green spoke a dozen green tongues , foliage covering hills and rising in lighter shades on the stony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mist lay like a deep sea on the hills , their tops breaking through like green islands in white water . Sometimes clouds in gray and black masses were piled above the distant mountains , toweringp191like Alps into the sky , a line of golden flame burning at the highest edges . He welcomed the softened warming days ; broke out the tractor mower on Saturday afternoons and drove himself in narrowing circles over the front and back lawns as Kitty sunned herself in a one-piece bathing suit on a strawberry beach towel in the grass . She wore her straw hat and sunglasses and read Cape Cod when she was n't napping in the sun . Or she watched the flowers in her garden . They drove into small towns in the Berkshires , walked in each , sometimes picnicked on roadside tables . They played shuttlecockon Sunday mornings ; once in a while tennis . Kitty disliked the game . Evenings they went more often to visit friends , driving with the Habershams or other couples to restaurants in nearby towns . After returning from his latest trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for drinks . Kitty nervously begged off and Dubin , of two minds , would n't in the end go without her . During the week , one afternoon she was n't working he asked her to go along on his long walk and Kitty , after changing into sneakers , walked with him . " We have n't done the long walk for a long time . " At the end of the walk , close to where he had been lost in the snow , Dubin felt an urge to leave the road and attempt to retrace his circular wandering , wherever it had been ; but one stone wall looked like another ; and the woods were full of green trees and flowering bushes , the farmland growing grains and grasses . Where he had been was in truth no longer there . " What are you thinking of ? " she asked and he answered : " D. H. Law-rence . " " Why did I ask ? I was thinking of you . " She had given up Ondyk with Ondyk 's blessing . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he had been working well . " I think it will be a good biogra-phyOne morning Dubin , slim man  --  he had stopped dieting  --  instead of cutting an orange in quarters and eating it at the breakfast table , peeled it , and stood at the morning-blue kitchen window chewing it in pulpy sections . He sucked each juicy piece . He enjoyed fresh coffee , putting on a clean shirt , listening to Kitty playing her harp . That night he was struck by the splendor of the spring sunset bathing the hills brightly crimson , then mauve . The biographer determined to be kinder to his life.  |p192Now  as he briskly strode along the road it was May-become-June , a touch of summer in the mild breeze , nice reversal of running time . If you 're into something  --  this lovely day  --  you 're in it , not longing for it . Dubin wore buff cords , striped T-shirt , blue sneakers with loose white laces : he had been shopping ; Kitty had said he needed summer things . He bowed to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linger . Its young leaves were light-green , seed pockets lavender , like a girl 's spring dress . In the fall it bloomed green-gold ; then the windy rain came and it was bare , broke the heart . The biographer hurried on . It could get dangerous loving trees , drive you wild . H.D.T. had wanted to embrace a scrub oak " with its scanty garment of leaves rising above the snow ... " Lush fields were sprinkled with wild flowers ; shrubs in bloom . The maples were dropping spinning white seeds into the breeze . Poplars reflected changing sunlight . The lyric greens of first spring had darkened and sights of field and wood enticed the eye : meadows sloping upward toward a descending line of trees ; and above sprawling woods upland fields rose to groves of evergreens surging over the hills . Mt . No Name , behind him , was covered with foliage except its stony top . The day was broken by patches of bright blue sky through gaps in cottony clouds sailing like slow ships . At intervals the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he observed : nature rather than scene . For nature he felt  --  had earned in winter this beauty of late spring . A new world , he sighed . In a new world he looked for a friend  --  scanned the road for Oscar Greenfeld  --  but the flutist , when you wanted him most , was elsewhere fluting . Dubin had regrets about his affair with Flora . A white Volvo passed from behind , swerved suddenly  --  it had drifted too close to the walker 's side of the road . Gave Dubin a turn ; sped on in the risen dust . Ten minutes later , as he was inhaling lungfuls of air at the verge of the road , the white car , long past its prime , drove by a second time , skirting the opposite shoulder of the road . It slowed down and , a hundred feet on , parked in the grass . Tourist stopping to view the view ? She seemed to hesitate , head bent as though considering the odds , then opened the door , set a doubtful foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant body , her sturdy stride , female presence . He reflected it was inevitable they would meet again . He knows life . Fanny , wearing sunglasses  --  he remembered the short denim skirt , herp193bare legs in sandals  --  walked toward him in deep focus , on her face an apprehensive smile . She was in no great hurry , taking her time , might never make it . Perhaps she did n't want to . People do impulsive things they immediatelyregret , Dubin for one . He might have trotted off the other way ; she 'd never have caught up once he was on the run  --  as if to prove he lived in his era , she in another . But here we both are . He 'd give her short shrift . Fanny smiled amiably , or tried to ; obviously there were difficult emotions to contend with ; maybe she was groping for one he could n't match . The man had learned his lesson . Now they touched hands , Dubin lightly . " I thought it was you but was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How are you , Fanny ? " His voice was subdued , manner polite . Dubin saw clearly what she had and what she lacked ; was unmoved by her . She lacked , he thought , experience of a necessary sort ; certain mistakes are wrong to make . " I hope you do n't mind me stopping to say hello . " " Hardly . " Why would he mind ? " I 'll bet you thought you 'd never see me again ? " " There were times I hoped so . " She paused to breathe , her lips moving as if she was searching for a new way not to wince . Fanny looked down , then directly at him , her pupils tight , mouth toward sour . He remembered the expression , tried to remember less , remembered all . Dubin was tempted to say a quick goodbye but after a momentarily shaky sense of wasted effort , a feeling quickly banished , objectivityreturned . Must n't make any more of the experience . Neither spoke for a minute , he observing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruby at its center . Gone six-pointed star and/or naked crucifix , whatever they had signified . Here was another sign . She looked sensibly older although less than a year had gone by since they had first met . She would be , he remembered , twenty-three come August . A child , he reflected , recalling her face in sleep . Mad he had felt so much for her all winter . A sort of love ; he knew the feeling , an old one , indulged in often in youth . Kept one young , he supposed . But how could I put my fate in her hands ? Dubin wondered what she had learned from the experience . It seemed to him a commentary on himself that he expected her to have learned something.  | " I finally had electrolysis done on my chin , " Fanny explained as though he had asked . " One morning in Rome I waked up anxious and made an appointment . The creep used an unsterilized needle and my face blew up but after a week I was okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you like it ? " Dubin thought it looked fine . " Visiting Center Campobello ? " She examined him vaguely . " Only for a week to take it easy , but I 'm driving back tomorrow . Roger invited me up when I got back from Rome and I came up for the day about a month ago . This time I was here a little longer . " " Thinking of getting married ? " he courteously inquired . She shook her head . " We 're friends  --  as my mother says  --  Platonically ; I do n't sleep with him . " He nodded politely . " I 'm capable of it . " " Is Roger ? " " He 's really a great guy . " " How was Rome ? " " Not that good , in fact flaky . My friend who I wrote you about  --  Harvey  --  died . " Dubin grimaced sympathetically . Fanny sadly smoothed the road with her sandal . " And I told you about my operation  --  the cyst I had ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could still have children and tried to think of her as a mother but it came to nothing . " My father 's been sick . I visited him last week in L.A. Otherwise I 'm stillliving in New York . I had a job for a month that I lost when I went toCalifornia . And I take an evening course at the New School . " Dubin approved . " How are you doing ? " Fanny wanted to know . " Fine , now , after a difficult winter . " She was for a moment neither here nor there , then said , " I 'm sorry for whatever of it was my fault . " Fanny had hesitantly raised her hand as if to sympathize with at least his bare arm but Dubin had instinctively stepped back . She was again uneasy.  |p195He  spoke kindly . He had , now they had talked again , nothing against the girl . She was who she was , no doubt her own worst enemy . Caveat emptor , or words to that effect . " No need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make our own fates . " " That might be , still people hurt each other without wanting to . Could I give you a ride somewhere ? " " Thanks , I 'm on my walk " She remembered , with a smile . Dubin , after gazing in the distance as though estimating tomorrow 's weather , after a confident minute of self-scrutiny , remarked , " Care to walk a little instead ? " If the invitation surprised her it did n't surprise him  --  normalizing things . For his sake if not hers : helped put the past in place . Calm now made experience then easier to live with . What still rankled still hurt . Better seeing in perspective , not always possible , but where it seemed to be occurring , let it . He did n't want the girl to be uncomfortable  --  scared of him . Suppose something similar  --  he doubted it  --  happened to Maud ? Fanny said she would n't mind . " Just let me get my bag out of the car . It 's got everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder bag and car keys . He noticed a bit-into peach on the front seat . Dubin advised her to lock the car ; Fanny did . They strolled in the direction he had been going . The afternoon sun , having escaped the steamy clouds , was now in full bloom . " Why do n't we get off this road and walk in the grass ? I dig that . " Fanny stepped up on a stone wall and before Dubin could warn against it had hopped off on the other side . " Private property , " he said . " I do n't think anyone 's going to arrest us for walking in the grass . There 's endless miles of it . " Dubin stepped up on the wall and jumped down . Fanny removed her sandals and dropped them and her glasses into her bag , swinging it back on her shoulder . " Careful of poison ivy . " " I 've never stepped in any that I know of , though I guess I 've stepped in everything . I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p196He  told her the plant had three shiny leaves . For a moment Fanny proceeded cautiously , then walked on without concern . It occurred to him he was more a comic type with her . With Kitty , their anxieties meshed , highlighting the serious life . That 's the way it is : you marry a serious woman the chances are increased of a serious fate ; a lighter type laughs every ten minutes and takes you with her . He said he knew a better way to walk , led her diagonally across the field . A brown cow wandered in their direction . Fanny quickly moved toward Dubin , who shooed the animal away . " At first I thought it was a bull . " " With those teats ? " " I 'm not wearing my contacts . " They climbed over another low wall into county property , walking along an overgrown broad path , remnant of a former road . Nearby a narrow brook flowed through the matted grass , turning where some two-trunked silver beeches grew . Fanny thought it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water she liked there was a pond in a quarry not too far from there . Beyond those trees he pointed to . It seemed , she thought , a good way to go . Fanny , as they were walking amid a scattering of bushes and small trees on the overgrown path , as if they were now far enough away from Europe to talk about their late mutual misadventure , asked , " Why did n't you answer my letters ? I honestly regretted what happened and said I respectedyou but the letter you sent me was a mean son-of-a-bitch . " " Mean was how I felt and the winter was freezing . I was in no mood to correspond with you . " " Is that the way you still feel ? " " Detached , " Dubin told her solemnly . " I think I 've earned it . " He said he had n't felt too bad when he had left Italy but once he was home selfdisgustcame down hard on him . " After your letter , and for other reasons I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've never lived through a worse winter . " " I said I was sorry , " she said sullenly . " I did a stupid thing but a lot that led to it was your own stupid fault . " " In Venice you said you did it to hurt me ; you did a good job . " " Because you made it pretty clear to me that you wanted only so muchp197of me and no more . I was n't to interfere with you or crawl into your life . I was to be invisible . " " I was protecting my wife . " " Who was protecting me ? " He did n't say . " I 'm not saying you were n't considerate and kind in nice ways that I really appreciate . But when I was having a bad trip in Rome and wrote for some advice and understanding , you did n't even bother to be civilized . I felt pretty bad . " " That 's what I was hoping . " " You got your hope . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said bitterly . If it was only her body I wanted , why the long heartbreak ? And if I was in love with a child how could I have been ? " Are you still sore at me ? " " I told you how I feel , I 've lived the experience , lived through it . " " I do n't bear grudges either , " Fanny said quietly . " I do n't have that kind of nature . " He complimented her on her nature . He would give her , Dubin reflected , fifteen minutes , then walk her to her car and hit the road . Fanny , her mood amiable , strode on freely . That she should now be walking by his side after the winter he had experienced seemed to him almost laughable , one of life 's little jokes . Yet better so than having the memory of her as she was in Italy locked in the mind forever as his last view of her . The biographer told her they were passing an abandoned orchard . " Nobodysprays the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branches into winter , looking like red bulbs on a Christmas tree . I 've seen crows peck at them through snow . " Fanny said she had never seen anything like that . " Why does n't somebody spray the apples ? " " There was a house here belonging to the people who owned the orchard . When the man died the widow had it moved away on rollers . The land , I understand , later went to the county for non-payment of taxes . " They arrived at a clearing  --  before them in the long fields a spangling of wild flowers , soft islands of blue , yellow , white , violet in the hazy green grass.  |p198He  remembered Lawrence had said wild flowers made him want to dance . Dubin felt happy but kept it to himself . The flower-stippled meadow extended to a crescent of oaks a quarter of a mile away . " Do you know wild flowers , Fanny ? " " Just a few . Most of my life I 've lived in cities , first in Trenton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , though , and have since I was small and was sent to camp . I once thought of majoring in environmentalstudies  --  preserving animals , forests , the land , you know . " " Why did n't you ? " " I got good enough grades but my heart was n't in staying in college . I was restless with myself . " He pointed to buttercups , then daisies . " Those are oxeye daisies . Do you know what the word means ?  --  the day 's eye , Fanny  --  beautiful , the sun in a flower . " She fished a plastic case out of her bag  --  her contact lenses . Fanny wetthem with the tip of her tongue , then pulled her eyelids apart and dabbedin each lens with her index finger . " Jesus , what pretty flowers ! " He pointed to a cluster of light-blue tiny flowers . " Do you know those ? " " Yes , forget-me-nots , I know them . " " Do you know the red ones there  --  trillium ? They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hen . Dubin picked a flower and handed it to her . At first she looked as though she did n't know what to do with it , then held it in her left hand . " The bright yellow flat open ones are celandine , " he said . " I once knew a girl by that name . " " Did you sleep with her ? " " I loved her . " " Is there a Fanny flower ? " " Not that I know but there is a sweet William . " " Male chauvinism , " Fanny laughed . Dubin chuckled huskily . He waded into the grass and plucked a whiteblossom . " This could be wild lily of the valley . I 'm not sure , I 'll have to lookit up when I get home . " He slipped the flower into his wallet . " Do you have a flower book ? "  | " My wife has a dozen . " Fanny thought she would buy herself one next time she went into a bookstore . " It 's about time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , " What about the blossoms on those bushes ? Do you know the names of them ? " Dubin said it was odd about the shrubs there . " They 're cultivated , not wild . The only way I can explain it  --  I figure this from the depression in the earth  --  is that once the house I mentioned stood here . The woman had shrubs growing around the place . That 's bridal wreath you asked about . It 's beginning to wither . " " How pretty some of those names are . What do you call those ? " " Mock orange . You have to smell the blossoms to be sure . There are others that look like them but have no scent . " " I can smell the orange , " Fanny said . She had picked a blossom and touched it to her lips . " It 's mock orange . " " How do you know them all ? " Dubin said he did n't know that many . " Lawrence seemed to recognize every flower in creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , literally hundreds of flowers . I know few . " " Man , you know all these . " " My lucky day . Some fields I pass I do n't know more than Queen Anne 's lace . My wife taught me most of them and some flowering bushes . When I forget their names I ask her again . " " How is she doing these days ? " Fanny wanted to know . " Are her glands still bothering her ? " He said she was fine . " You mentioned her yourself just now , " she said slightly stiffly . " Roger happened to tell me she was good in her library work . " He affirmed his wife was fine . " Does she still go around sniffing the gas burners ? " Dubin said he was used to the burners . " I try not to say anything when she smells them , and for that I expect her not to comment when I yell at myself in the bathroom mirror . " " She and I never liked each other much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny . " They were walking a few feet apart , Fanny kicking the flowers . " I 'm notp200criticizing or anything like that but did you know she 'd go around smelling the gas before you married her ? " " You ca n't know everything in advance or what 's marriage for ? You take your chances . Whoever marries you will be taking one . " " You can say that again . But I may not want to get married . " " It 's not so bad . In a marriage , after a while you learn what 's given : who your wife is and you are , and how well you can live with each other . If you think you have a chance you 're married . That 's your choice if nothing else was . " It 's not much of one . " " We met in a curious way , " Dubin explained . " Once I said I 'd tell you about it . It was like not really meeting until we were ready to . She had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you answered it ? " Fanny said in pretend-astonishment . " I happened to read it , though it was n't addressed to me , and another she wrote canceling the intent of the first . To make it short , I became interested in her . We corresponded until we had developed some sense of each other . If a man and woman stay around trying to define themselves , at a certain point they become responsible one to the other . So we met , looked , talked , and after a while arranged to be married . " " What do you mean arranged ' ? " " That 's how I think of it . Kitty may have a better word . " " Were you in love with her ? Like with Celandine ? " " She was someone I wanted to love . " " Did she feel that way ? " They had gone through the flowers and were approaching a small wood of thick-armed dark-green oaks whose trunks were spotted with mold . " I imagine there was an expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take long to happen . " " Why did n't you live together first and try it out ? " " In those days , " he explained , " few did that , Fanny . You got married . Those who did n't were rare birds and not always happy ones . Kitty was a widow with a child . I needed to be settled . " " Do you love her now ? When I passed you on the road before I thought you looked lonely . " " Some are lonelier than others . My mother , in her sad way , was very lonely ; my father had to be . I suppose I 'm more than ordinarily a solitudinousp201type . It 's not a curse if you learn what the pleasures of it are . But that 's another story . " " I ca n't stand being lonely . There are no pleasures in it for me . " " You should n't have many worries , you seem to make friends easily . " She wanted to know how he meant that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd better not because I 'm not . If I was once I 'm not any more . " She looked at him intently . " Do you believe that ? " He was n't sure but said he did . " What are your questions asking , Fanny ? " " About marriage . Everybody talks about it differently . I like to know what it is . " " Bear and forbear , ' Sam Johnson defined it . " " That 's not much . " " He was very sensible about marriage as he was in most things . " " What about you ? " " In the best of marriages you give what you can and get back as much or more . With the right people it 's a decent enterprise . It gives pleasure . " " It sounds too much like work to me . " " Thomas Carlyle , who had an awful marriage , called it a discipline of character . ' " " I would n't want that kind of marriage , " she said impatiently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I want to get married . It wore my mother out . She hates my father . " Dubin said he understood . " What do you understand ? " " A little more about you . " " Maybe you do and maybe you do n't . " " I think I do . " " What I mean is do you really understand what I 'm like  --  what my needs are , for instance ? " He had some idea . " You 've described yourself in your letters . " " I did n't tell you everything . " " I 've seen you in action . Some things I can guess . " " I bet you 'd be wrong . " " Possibly . " " Possibly , " she mimicked him.  |p202Fanny  dropped the red trillium he had given her into her shoulder bag . " Did you ever want a divorce ? " He said he and his wife had discussed the subject more than once that past winter . " What did you decide ? " " Nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny reached down and plucked a blade of grass to suck on . " Like she expects you to go on forever protecting her ? " " Like she has character , " Dubin answered . " Like I respond to it . " She threw the grass away . " Maybe I have character too . " Dubin hoped so . After a wet morning and overcast late morning a warm sunny afternoon evolved . Large long clouds slowly sailed by . " Oh , shit , " the girl suddenly cried , hopping on one leg . " My foot is bleeding . I stepped on something . " She had cut the ball of her left foot on a piece of slate . Fanny sat down in the grass . The cut bled . Dubin got down on his knees to examine her foot . " It does n't look deep but it ought to be bandaged so you can get back to your car . The pond is close by . I could wet my handkerchief , wash the cut , and bandage your foot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William . Just tie something around it so I do n't get my sandal sticky with blood when I put it on . I just bought a new pair . " Dubin tried finger pressure to stop the bleeding . " Here 's some kleenex , " Fanny said , pulling a wad out of her bag . " Use it and do n't get your hankie bloody . " But he insisted on binding his handkerchief around her foot , knotting it on the arch . " The cut should be sterilized . " " I have a tube of first-aid cream in my glove compartment . " " I 'll go get it . " " Not now , " said Fanny . " I wo n't get blood poison . Or will I ? " she asked worried . " I 'll get the cream . " " No , " she said . " It 's not a bad cut . " " Is the bandage too tight ? " " It feels comfortable . "  |p203With  Dubin 's assistance she got up . " Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . Did you ever want to be a doctor ? " " A lawyer , " he said , " a drastic mistake . " The biographer suggested they turn back to the car but Fanny still wanted to see the water in the quarry . " Can you go where it 's rocky ? " " I 'll take it easy . I think the bleeding has stopped . " They went on in the grass , Fanny hop-walking on her heel , and passed through the warm leaf-dappled mildewed oak wood ; then ascended the sloping granite rock to look down at the green water in the jagged deep basin . " It 's a lot bigger than I thought . Do you swim here ? " " I come to look at the water . " " Want to try ? " " It 's dirtier than I thought . Besides , we have no towels . " " You could dry yourself with your underwear . " " Why do n't you go in yourself ? " " Never mind , " Fanny said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at the edge of the water , opposite them a palisade of earth and marble debris out of which some alders and white birch grew and many thick ferns ; below , the granite wall was stained tan , gray , black . The granite had been almost totally mined and the pit left to weather many years before Dubin came to Center Campobello . He had found the quarry in an adventurous jaunt with Kitty and still came every season to observe the reflection of the trees in the water . In the autumn Dubin watched yellow leaves floating in green water . Fanny , piling her hair on her head , tried to see herself in the pond . " Do you like my hair this way ? It 's not too short ? " Dubin did n't think so . She let her hair fall and combed it , looking for herself in the water . Fanny , with her bandaged foot and shorn hair , sat close to William Dubin as if they had no prior history . Her thighs were bare , bosom relaxed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispassionately . Ah , William , nature 's child , who would remotely have guessed you 'd find your way to this spot in her company this day ? He sat listening as the girl , her fingers interlocked behind her head , unshaved armpits visible , talked about her travail in Rome.  |p204Harvey  's death had seriously got her down . " He was always kind to me , sort of kidded me out of the blues I got into . I met him through his shmucky son Mitchell , who was an orthodontist in Jersey City . Mitch misused me when I was a kid and Harvey found out in a stupid letter I wrote that he had left around . I mentioned the sexual things he had taught me and told him those I liked . After he read the letter Harvey got pissed and warned him to leave me alone or I might get him thrown in the can on a statutory-rape rap , plus impairment of the morals of a minor . Harvey said if I or my father did n't bring charges he just might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifteen when I met him , sixteen when Harvey broke it up . " She said she had met Mitchell at her cousin Mildred 's wedding . " He was built , with a good ass and strong shoulders . He had brown hair , reddish sideburns , and came on very macho . Anyway , he gave me a lot of attention and a wedding is where you want to feel good . He turned me on by talking about sex in a way that made me feel it was very mysterious and only he knew how to make it happen . " I was having hot thoughts and went with him to his apartment after the wedding . Then for the next year almost , till Harvey found that letter , we were in bed or on the floor every Sunday afternoon . I took the bus in Trenton to Jersey City , then a cab to his apartment . He gave me the carfare . Mitchell taught me all the joys of sex and some that were kinky . " " Bastard , " murmured Dubin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much scared of sex for years . I bet you never guessed that ? The best thing that came of my experience with Mitchell was that night Harvey called me when I was feeling low , and we got to be friends , and I have never regretted it . " " Why did you let the affair with the son go on so long ? " " Because I was n't sure about it and thought the more I learn about sex the better for me . I thought everybody had to know what I learned from him . Besides , he said he loved me and I thought he really did . He even filled my cavities and straightened my front teeth . The first thing he did when I got there on Sundays was to take off my braces so that kisses would n't hurt . " " An ape , " Dubin ventured . Fanny said he was n't such a bad guy . " I liked certain things we did . Outside of his habit of screwing whenever he was n't working his heart was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free clinic and wouldn'tp205charge poor people . Harvey said he was the narcissist of the family . When I understood his nature I felt sorry for him . He 's been in psychoanalysis about twenty years . " Dubin grunted . " I had a shaky time after we broke up . When I was seventeen I felt fifty years old . I was n't getting much out of school but hung in because somehow or other my grades were decent . I went to college . About then I began to sleep around . I was afraid I might become frigid after Mitch , and was scared . I got anxious and slept with people I should n't have slept with . I was depressed and used to pray . Then one day I read a book by Havelock Ellis and it helped me orient myself differently . I also was seeing a shrink although my father begrudged every nickel . Anyway , by the time I was twenty I began to enjoy sex again and I want to go on enjoying it , like forever . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more moral person . Does that relate to the experience with Mitchell or its aftermath ? " " I said a better person . " She looked him full in the face . " I 'll bet you thought of me as a hooker ? " " If I did , I do n't . " " I 'm not . I was ashamed of what happened in Venice . It was freaky , I was confused . " Fanny had opened her bag , found the trillium , and tossed it into the water . He asked her why . " I wanted to see it float . " They watched the three-petaled red flower floating in the green quarry water . Fanny , after a while , asked Dubin what his first sex was like . " With an older woman , " he replied , " doing a repair job . " " On you ? " He nodded . " She was married , a teacher of mine . I had read Sons and Lovers with her . " " How long did it last ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her about Harvey . " Was he your lover before we met ? " " Not really . He was into marijuana and pottery , never quite putting it together . I stayed with him for weeks just to be with one man . There were times when we wanted to love each other but could n't . I tried to help him keep up his confidence . "  | " You were kind to him ? " " We were kind to each other . " Fanny 's arms were wrapped around her knees . She extended her left hand so he could see the bracelet he had bought her . " I wear it for luck . " " How so ? " " You let me keep it . " The light on the eastern hills was dark gold as the sun descended in the west . " It 's late , " Dubin said . " I 'll bet you do n't know why I first came to Center Campobello , " Fanny said . " Was there a particular reason ? " " I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commune on Tupper Lake . The way he was at the end of his life after Susy died , and then his wife , and he also felt miserable for treating his epileptic daughter like an idiot all her life  --  that part wiped me out . " " At the end of his life he lived in a theater of shmalzy misery , " Dubin said . " Shmalzy ? " " He enjoyed cigars and being a celebrity . He was deteriorating physically and mentally , but maybe in the book I laid on his aging and loneliness a bit much . Thoreau is a better-proportioned , more objective work . " " I read it in Rome . Harvey bought it for me as a present when I was in the hospital . I like Thoreau but would n't want to live his kind of life , although I liked the way he felt about himself at Walden . What I mean is that after I finished reading Mark Twain somebody said you had a house in this town and I decided to see if you would meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I hoped we could really talk , that you would want to . I wanted somebody other than a shrink to advise me about my life , how to get it together better than I did . I had the feeling you could tell me useful things about myself . I never thought we would end up going to Venice . When you asked me I felt let down . " " What did you expect after undressing in my study ? " " I do n't know what I expected . I was afraid of you and did n't want to be , so I went with you . " " I 'm sorry I did n't respond more appropriately to your needs . "  | " You did in your books . The only one I do n't like is Short Lives . " " Is that so ? It 's awfully popular in paperback . " " Oh ? " Fanny said nervously . " I do n't want to read about people ass backwards . I do n't dig death hanging over everything they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not of death but maybe what leads to it . " " Does n't life lead to it ? " " I 'm speaking of sickness , accident  --  being incapacitated ; unable to run my life ; that can be worse than death . I 'm afraid of the unexpected . What I expect I can deal with . On the other hand these short lives show how intensely and creatively life can be lived even when it is early aborted . In terms of years lived , they missed little ; they were n't counting . " " If you 're dead you 're dead , " Fanny said . " Nobody has to tell me what to do with my life , only how to get it together . I know all I want to about death . I do n't want my nose rubbed in it . " " It 's late , " Dubin said after a minute , " let 's go home . " She stared at him . He helped her up , noticing she stood firmly on the cut foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mail it to him . He asked her where she had got the locket she was wearing . She fingered it . " Harvey gave it to me about a week before his heart attack . " " A whole heart for a broken one ? " " He liked me a lot . " Fanny asked him whether Dubin would answer if she wrote to him once in a while . He was not much a letter writer , he said . Why waste what the winter had taught him ? As they were moving down the granite slope half a dozen black birds rose from the oak trees and flapped off toward the reddened sun . The dark rays of the dying sun touched the tips of the trees . Overhead , massive bronze clouds in long convoys were moving east . As Fanny and Dubin came out of the wood a softened early-evening light lay on the long field of wild flowers . Fanny began to name them . " There 's celandine , oxeye daisy , red rooster  --  what a ball those names are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I knew , and those bushes are bridal wreath . "  |p208She  plucked a red trillium and thrust it into her shoulder bag , then began to collect a bouquet of daisies . The clouds were crimson , those close to the hills were violet ships voyaging to black mountains . Fifteen or more billion years after creation , the biographer thought , here'sthis sea of wild flowers on earth and amid them this girl picking white daisies . " Look , " said Fanny as they were walking in the grass , " there 's wild lilyof the valley , if you guessed right . I 've learned the names of them all . " She touched Dubin 's arm . He touched the curve of her back . Fanny , letting her bouquet of daisies slip from her hand , turned to him . The biographer , assailing doubt , took her in his arms . Fanny sank into the warm grass , arching her hips as he drew down her underpants . This evens it , Dubin thought , for the cruel winter.  |p209Dear  Fanny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and kissed it , a gesture that stirred him . Ponce de Leon had galloped in the wrong direction : the fountain of youth is the presence of youth . In her company he enjoyed the sense of fountain within , experienced flowers of splashing water . He had seen her in the city twice in June and again in July ; had come to New York for two-day visits . This time he arrived for a week one late afternoon on a Saturday in August , a warmish pleasant summer 's day , Fanny 's twenty-third birthday . She had written , " I want to spend my birthday with you . " On the train Dubin had opened his paper , anticipatingtheir meeting , going to bed with her . Soon a thin gloom stole over him and he lowered the newspaper to track down why . Easy enough : Kitty and Maud had driven him to the train station . There were kisses goodbye . He was on his way to the city , he had announced , to complete a contract for three articles he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at the Public Library ; maybe visit an old friend or two . " Have a good time , " Kitty had said . " Lots of fun , " Maud affirmed , not at her best that day . Her hair was still an unhappy mix of red streaked black . She looked as though she hated to see him go , and for a moment hep210wanted not to leave her . When he looked again she needed someone else and he thought that natural . Everyone wants Dubin to enjoy himself . They were planning a few days on the Maine Coast . Maud , to tell the truth , was mostly bored , a summer at home less than satisfying as she dealt with an excitement within , now apparently on , now apparently off . Kitty had suggested a drive up the coast to cheer her up and Maud had consented to go if she did the driving . He wished , considering the circumstances , they had n't insisted on taking him to the train , but they knew he disliked buses . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to put them out of mind . They returned at once through predictable doors and windows . One ca n't easily dispense with the actors of his personal history . The biographer , as he read the newspaper , hefted and measured guilt , yet managed to sidestep it : I 'm not twenty , nor forty  --  I 'm fifty-seven . Surely these years entitle me to this pleasure . In life one dare n't miss what his nature requires . Only the spiritually impoverished can live without adventure . After a while the sweep of the broad silver-blue sunlit Hudson , from the window , the smoky Catskills in the distance , helped him cast off the subtle net on his spirit and he listened to himself thinking of being , soon , with Fanny . Dubin , as the train sped on , reflected without nostalgia how it had been when he was a young man with a prearranged date  --  rarely with a girl one might meet by chance in park or museum , want to be with , and is . But prearrangement had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anticipation of pleasure . As the time of meeting approached , nature improved , the evening expanded , stars were jewels in the sky . As he shaved , dressed , waited for the last minutes to go by before he left the house , enjoying reverie , expectation ; he felt a sense of well-being so intense it could only taint , perhaps spoil , the experience : there were times the girl was n't  --  could n't possibly be  --  as much pleasure as his expectation of her . He would envision more than she was ; wanted more to give than he ultimately gave . The occasion therefore became self-defeating , Dubin trying to squeeze out of prevision , desire , something it was not prepared to yield . He had expected more than reality entitled him to  --  defense against an ordinary fate : an extraordinary woman . Out of hubris , if not fear , young William Dubin had felt an unwillingness to risk himself with someone whose experience was too much like his own . When , years later , Kitty Willis appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility , someone who could give him not only what he had n't had , but had n't thought of having ; Dubin had then stopped sidestepping marriage . Dear Fanny : He had told her when he was coming but had n't expected her to be waiting for him when the train arrived . There she was at the rope barrier . Men looked at her as they passed by and she was modestly reserved although her body seemed extrinsic to her clothes , a natural gift Dubin approved in principle . Fanny had changed her hair style since he had seen her last , her thick hair now drawn above her ears and pulled through a silver ring into a loose light mane falling to below her summer-tanned shoulders . She wore a yellow skimp , her bosom snug in the fabric , her legs bare , always good to see in short dresses . She had put on a pound or two and was relaxed , her face womanly . Neither was on probation in the other 's eyes . Dubin felt heartened to have recovered her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When they arrived in Fanny 's apartment on West 83rd Street she unbuttoned his shirt and began quickly to undress . Dubin helped . In bed they loved each other generously . He , after a catnap , lay restfully on her pillow , gazing at a gardenia that looked like three gardenias in a water glass on top of her bookcase . " I put it there for you to see because you like flowers . " " Dear Fanny . " The evening grew in pleasure , serenity , magnitude . She took ten minutes to brush her hair as Dubin watched each stroke . They dressed and hailed a cab to a bistro she knew on First Avenue . At a bar with its back to a curtained window , Dubin , man of the world , drank brandy and soda as he talked with the young bartender about the merits of Lawrence 's early novels , and Fanny , sipping Scotch on the rocks , seriously listened , her warm side pressed to his . The bartender , when Dubin began to explicate D. H. Lawrence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who loathe sexuality so deeply am considered a lurid sexuality specialist . Mi fa malo allo stomacho "  --  let his eyes rest seriously on Fanny 's handsome bosom . Dubin felt expansive , amiable , personally wealthy . " Sex to him , you understand , despite his ideology of blood-being , was a metaphor for a flowering life . " The bartender gravely nodded . Fanny , her arm around her middle-aged lover , nudged her head againstp212his chest . Dubin kissed her ear . She had a gift of closeness , could almost not bear not being in contact with whomever she felt affection for . She touched , stroked , quietly pressed . Few men had it so good . " Let 's dance , " she said . A combo of piano , bull fiddle , and drums in a far corner of the room had begun to play . Dubin tried to beg off , swore he could n't  --  not this new mode of dance . He had been brought up on fox-trot and waltz , could lindy a little , not more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make them up . Hop like a monkey . Peel a banana . " " Then what ? " " Climb a tree . " He did as he was told . Fanny danced to his movements in a way that made him look good . She danced deadpan with wide-open through her scent and felt he was dancing off the floor . A blonde of thirty or so dancing nearby with a man of Dubin 's age winked at the biographer and told him to save the next one for her . Fanny laughed merrily . After a supper of omelette , green salad , white wine , Fanny asked him where he wanted to go . Miraculous question : here 's Dubin with nowhere to go except where he pleased . Nothing scheduled , appointed , expected . He was this evening , in truth , a free spirit . Dubin , the single . There were a dozen things to do and he might do them all . " You name it , " he told her . " Disco ? I know a good one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see friends of mine in the East Village ? " " Young people ? " " About my age . They have two kids . Or we could go to a picture I hear is great . " " Fine . " They walked to a movie on Third Avenue . It was there Fanny kissed his hand in the dark and Dubin kissed hers . One did not have to guess with Fanny : she was there , gave instinctually ; he easily gave in return . After the film he looked for a bookstore . Dubin remembered how happy it had made Kitty , one evening not long after they had met , when he bought her a book of poems . Fanny had never read Yeats ; he bought her the Selected Poems , exactlyp213what he had got Kitty ; and at the florist 's up the block , a white rose . Fanny carried it and the book solemnly in one hand , hugging his right arm with her left as they walked on the Drive , refreshed by the cool air of the river . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer safe . Dubin felt a melancholy regret at the way the world had gone ; and she , sensing his mood , fell silent . At home Fanny put on the coffeepot while Dubin examined her bookcase and found in it hardback copies of each of his biographies . She had managed to get even the out-of-print Abraham Lincoln  --  probably had cost her twenty bucks . On the wall above the bookcase hung a medium-enlarged framed colored snapshot of Fanny , pigeons circling her head and shoulders , that Dubin had taken with her camera one morning ages ago  --  was it really less than a year ?  - -  in the Piazza San Marco . He remembered the picture of her in jeans and lank hair she had sent from Rome last winter and asked if he could have a print of the one on the wall . " Sure , but suppose your wife sees it ? " " She does n't poke into my things , and if she did she 'd know who I was in Venice with . " " How is it you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fanny regarded him silently . She began to nibble the nail of her middle finger but there was no nail to nibble . Her fingernails were , as a rule , ragged . " Where does she think you are now ? " " Not where I presently am . " Dubin moved from the bookcase to get away from the thought . She followed him . " In one way I do n't mind that hassle in Venice we had . " " Which way ? " " It made me feel closer to you than I might have if everything had gone right . Do you feel close to me , William ? " They kissed . Fanny drew herself a vitabath . She got her diaphragm out of the bureau drawer and took it into the bathroom . She had been advised after her operation not to take the Pill , she had told Dubin . He was enjoying the thought of sleeping with her again tonight ; it had been years since he had slept with a woman twice in a day . He undressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly , a shadow of itself . The telephone rang . Fanny got rid of whoever it was before the guy could seriously unburden himself . Dubinp214had heard a man 's urgent voice ; she did n't say who . He felt uneasy . As Fanny bathed he thought of her lying nude on her double bed and imagined a line of men coiled around it , a long line of types and ages extending into the hall and down a flight of stairs ; from Mitchell the orthodontist to William Dubin the biographer . How many men had she had in her young life  --  fifty ? eighty ?  --  a hundred and fifty ? How many diaphragms had she worn out in her comparatively short sexual lifetime ? Did she have one on  --  was it possible ?  --  when he took her amid the wild flowers ? Or did she take me ? He felt a momentary distrust of her ; but as Dubin , lying on Fanny 's sheets , reflected on the course of human lives  --  on desire , error , pain , understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny her sexual past . And when they were lying in bed after her fragrant bath it seemed to him as if they had come together in innocence . He had re-created her virginity . Fanny , with her nail scissors , snipped the thorns off the white rose and wound its green stem around his erect cock . She kissed the flower . Dubin wished her a happy birthday . Kitty , before sex , lowered the shades ; Fanny had none on her windows . She came out of the shower naked , dressed in the sunny bedroom and walked around with wet hair , barefoot in cotton underpants . Kitty sneezed when her hair was wet . She was trim . Fanny 's rump was heavier than he had thought , her waist narrower . " Why do n't you get yourself some window shades ? " Dubin asked her . " I have nothing to hide , do you ? " " What about the synagogue across the street ? " " That 's on the second floor and even when I stand at the window with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when I do n't have any clothes on they do n't look my way . Or if somebody does he 's searching for God . I do n't need window shades . " Dubin often watched the elderly Jews at prayer , or as they sat at study around a long table in a brown room on the left side of the synagogue . He bought two large white shades for Fanny 's bedroom windows . Her apartment , in an old six-story graystone , was not especially attractive , needed painting , bathroom repairs . Roaches haunted the area around sink and range . Dubin sprayed disinfectant liberally , diligently , until no limping survivor remained . Fanny had two medium-size rooms and a small kitchen but the windows , in heavy flaking frames , were large , the apartment light ;  |p215and  she got it for two hundred a month . She had a new job that was n't bad  --  the work interesting  --  as secretary to an executive secretary in a law office . She did n't like nine-to-five , found the hours restrictive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the week he lived with her , Dubin slept later than usual . Her alarm rang at 7:30 . He awoke alert and began his modified exercises ; Fanny , into Yoga when she came home , stopped to look on as she dried herself after her shower . Dubin fried an egg and made coffee to get her off on time . She ate slowly , hungrily . She was slow in the morning but not distracted . Fanny was clean but not , like Kitty , neat ; he realized how alien to her nature it had been to houseclean for others last summer . It took her about an hour to shower , brush and fix her hair , then select and screw on earrings , a variety of single and double circles of silver mostly . She said , " I 'll hit the can and be right out . " As she slipped on her dress she seemed lost in thought . She left the house anytime from ten to nine to a quarter after , predicting she 'd be fired by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper , he hurried her to the Broadway bus . She was usually in good humor , laughed when he was witty , kissed him slowly at the bus stop , to Dubin 's self-conscious concern , because people were looking and he was embarrassed by his age ; but he would rather be kissed . Afterward he read the Watergate news with intense interest . Nixon had resigned . During the impeachment proceedings Dubin had trotted his walk holding a pocket radio in his hand . Fanny and he looked through the papers every night and talked about the case before going to bed . He wondered what sort of life one might write of Nixon , provided one could stand the monotony of his mind and character . The man made him uncomfortable . It occurred to Dubin how lucky he was to be working on someone of the rich complexity of D. H. Lawrence and felt affection for him , for his self-respect . Dubin wrote on Fanny 's kitchen table after he had cleared it off and washed the breakfast dishes . He put away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food cabinet . In the bedroom he hung up her slight black nightgown on a hook behind the closet door . He liked the sight of her bright short dresses hanging in the closet and thought of buying her one or two on his own . He tossed her used tights into the hamper , gave up on the rat 's nest of bottles , tubes , containers in the bathroom , but took a minute to mop the tiled floor . Dubin then put the plastic garbage bag out ;  |p216he  had bought her a new garbage container . And he enjoyed the happy surprise with which she greeted the order he had made . Once he had cleaned and straightened up the place  --  Fanny hastily made the bed before leaving  --  he was in a mood for work . It did not bother him that he was not in his study ; this was , after all , a holiday , and allowing himself to work , gravy . He laid out his cards , jotted down notes , and began to write careful sentences . Dubin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every so often to watch the elderly Jews reading or at prayer . After lunch he rode the Fifth Avenue bus to the Public Library and read in the reference room . One day he took the train to Newark to see where he had lived as a child ; he felt no nostalgia ; but it occurred to him he had n't visited his father 's and mother 's graves in years , Charlie Dubin had bought his wife 's grave in a cemetery in the Bronx and his own in a huge graveyard in Queens . " I got a bargain for my plot . " Most often in thinking of him Dubin saw the father of his childhood , younger than he himself was now . His mother he usually thought of as she had looked after she became insane . Only once had he been to his drowned brother 's grave in Newark but could not bear to go that day . After the library , he usually walked home  --  up Fifth , through Central Park to West 96th , then back on West End to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long walk in Center Campobello . He did not dwell on other equivalents of his New York experience . Fanny lived in a walk-up graystone with a partly semicircular facade . A fenced yellow steam-stack on the far side of the street spouted a cloud of white steam all day and night . Diagonally across the street were a few stores ; and above a florist 's shop , the second-floor synagogue , under a roof with a raised skylight . It was not a hot August , and Fanny , if Dubin shopped for her , would rather prepare supper than go out . She fed him large quantities of food . Fanny was n't a talented cook but she was not a bad one and dared cook fish , giggling and groaning . Dubin liked fish but Kitty rarely cooked it . Kitty loved snails , clams , mussels , and frog 's legs ; but Dubin did not . Fanny avoided snails and oysters but enjoyed lobster . Dubin had mastered shrimp and crabmeat and stayed clear of other shellfish . He had had none as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant , got him to share her lobster . After supper if the apartment was stuffy they usually went out . They saw A Comedy of Errors in the park ; once attended her weekly summer evening class in government at the New School . On Saturday afternoon Dubin took her to the Metropolitan Museum and told her what he knew about painting.  |p217He  explained what Kitty had told him about Chinese pottery . She listened as though memorizing . Her bookcase was varied : he noticed books on psychology , political theory , music , ecology . " Fanny , " he said , " you 're a hidden intellectual . " " I 'm smarter than I look , " she answered , " but not always organized . I 'm fairly well organized at work but not when it comes to making decisions for myself . That 's where I am missing a cylinder . I wish you could help me make up my mind what I ought to be doing with myself . " Dubin said he would . " I am better controlled when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean ? " On a framed bulletin board in the kitchen she tacked up snippets of sayings : " Be kind to yourself . " ' He remembered . " Morality begins when one can control experience . " He wondered if she had once that week thought of Kitty . Probably she would say that was his business . Dubin had attended to his business . From his H D. Thoreau she had copied this sentence : " There is no other land ; there is no other life but this or the like of this . " He gave her credit . He was careful with her , considerate of her pace and qualities . He liked to do things she suggested . At twilight , one evening , they walked into Central Park and listened , amid a circle of people in a variety of dress , some standing there with their dogs , to the steel drums played by two West Indians who beat up high haunting melodies in their gleaming pots and let them flow into dusk . Afterward they walked to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass . Fanny slipped her hand into Dubin 's back pocket and felt his ass as he walked . They wandered , as the street lights came on , up Madison , seeing themselves in store windows when they stopped to look . There was this fine-figured girl in a light-orange summer dress ; and with her an erect slightly self-conscious middle-aged type , smoking a cigarillo , in bell-bottoms , blazer , and Panama hat . Each stared at the reflection of the other as though neither could believe they were together . They locked fingers as they walked . She called him Bill , tried Will , went back to William . William could sound funny when she said it . When he read poetry to her she sat close in a chair , her bare legs resting on his thighs . She told him personal things : why her periods were late ; confessed to occasional problems of constipation , for which he advised her to cook up a pot of prunes with lemon rind and have a plateful each morning . She wrote left-handed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typed beautifully , retyped his Lawrencep218pages for him . Fanny created little favors for Dubin . At night she drew down the white shades and they turned to each other with passion . She slept heavily . He too slept deeply , lying against her strong young sweet-smelling body . One night he woke from deep sleep to find himself being sucked off . The pleasure was all but unbearable . Fanny moved her moist mouth patiently until he came with a cry , almost of protest . " What was that for ? " " I woke up and wanted to . " In the morning they woke making love . Fanny stayed home from work and they slept till noon . He had tried to break through sleep to get up but could n't . Afterward they rose , showered , ate leisurely , went back to bed . Dubin loved her body , was conscious of her sensuality , aroused by the force of her sexual being . She was embarrassed by nothing , named her pleasures . He responded to her desire by running his tongue along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dubin ; he felt like a god . Fanny asked if he had liked doing it . She was sitting cross-legged in bed . How intimate strangers can be . " For the effect it has on you , yes . " " Do n't do anything you are not comfortable with . " That night she massaged his back with lotions , unguents , kneading his shoulders , pressing her strong fingers into his flesh , working down his legs , rubbing , stroking . His heart beat like a drum . " Does your wife massage you too ? " " No . " " Never ? " " Never . " " Too bad , " said Fanny . She was subtle , cunning , gifted in touch , wet him exquisitely . She seemed to watch her effect on him . Dubin cherished their intimacy . But when he asked whether she was teaching him the orthodontist 's repertory , Fanny denied it . " What he taught me has got nothing to do with what I want to give you or want you to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , another is a fire . At first I thought you 'd be a loaf of rye bread but now there 's something wild in you that I like . " " A wild rye bread or wildfire ? " " A wild flower , " Fanny laughed . " I want you to have a lot of fun . " Dubin replied it was what he wanted . He felt satisfied in a way he had n't since early in his marriage . The intensity of pleasure , of possibility , was greater now . Live and learn.  |p219I  want her to teach me , he thought . I want to know everything she does . I 'm more than twice her age . Her orgasm , she swore , spaced her . " It 's like coming full blast out of a cannon . " She let go in surprise . " Will-yam , " she sang as to a friend far away . His ended in a slow drop from the bursting sky ; knowing it would end safely in a warm bed . He was fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to them might never have ; then magically it had happened . Somethinggood , fortunate , had come into his life . With this girl I know the flowering pleasure , heathen innocence , of the natural life . I live in her sun-strong garden . He was grateful to her ; they held each other close and kissed affectionately . As Fanny slept Dubin lay awake thinking of his Passion of D. H. Lawrence . He was glad the pleasures of this week had come to him as they had : this long careless giving of oneself in sex . His experiences with Fanny , in variety , intensity , excitement heightened by her watchful curious knowing , sureness of her sexual self , willingness to give , could n't have come at a better moment . He understood Lawrence more fully , his religion of sexuality : a belief in the blood , the flesh , as wiser than the intellect . I think I know what he means by " the unknown God brought into consciousness "  --  " the slow invasion in you of the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Pagan vision . " " This is very important to our being , that we should realise that we have a blood-being , a blood-consciousness , a blood-soul , complete and apart from the mental and nerve consequences . " I ca n't say I fully believe it , Dubin thought , but understand more clearly where it came from in his nature and why he said it in these words . I think  --  I feel I understand him . Unable to sleep , he rose hyped up , his imagination pouring ideas like rain . He felt like working but had better not if he could work longer later . He stood at the bedroom window , one shade raised , gazing above the steaming smokestackat the synagogue . The building was darkened except for a small candlelitroom where a black-bearded black-hatted Jew , his white shawl glowing on his shoulders , bent back and forth in prayer . Once in a while Dubin prayed . It was a way of addressing the self ; God had a tin ear . Who wanted to listen to human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? He thought of Gerald and Maud but this time prayed a moment forp220Fanny , then got into bed with the girl , who did not stir . He moved close to her sex-scented body , and as she sighed , fell into sleep . He was awakened by the sound of rain , or a distant sobbing , as though someone was lost and he was n't sure who . Dubin fought against waking but it sprang out of him like an idiot tearing at the roots of sleep . Protesting the task , he ascended a ladder , rising step by gluey step until he miraculously thrust his head through a foggy hole . In his confusion he called her Kitty . He lay with eyes open trying to understand what Fanny was complaining about . He felt her twisting in her sleep . With an effort he turned on the bed lamp . Her eyelids were twitching , arms moved in spasms , her mouth tormented ; she seemed to be locked in a nightmare . " Fanny . " He shook her gently . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubin shook her again . With a groan Fanny quickly sat up , astonished to see him there . She fell into his arms in relief . " Jesus , " she shuddered , " I had this mind-blowing god-awful dream  --  it was one of those awful ones with blood and shit in it  --  that I 'd been killed in an accident . I saw myself dead and could n't wake until you made me . " She wept in bed . " I do n't want to die young . I hate that book you wrote . Why did you give it to me ? " " Forgive me , " Dubin said . Afterward she was depressed . Dubin got up to brew her a cup of tea . As he was waiting for the water to boil he looked uneasily out of the window for a sign of dawn . Wanting to sleep , he did not want it to be dawn ; neither did the night  --  black , heavy , inert . Across the silent street the candlelight was out in the synagogue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked , then put out the light and quietly talked . She turned on her side , resting on his arm . " I dreamed I saw someone with a crazy crippled face watching us from the fire escape . " " What fire escape ? " " I dreamed there was one . I feel scared about something , I wish I knew what it was . I 'm afraid something bad might happen to me . I do n't want to do the wrong thing with my life . Advise me , William . I 'm afraid I 'll be anxious again . Tell me what to do about myself . You 're so serious about life , tell me what to do with mine . " He said it was n't so simple , he did n't know her that well . " You know me well enough , " she said fiercely  | " You 're a late bloomer , Fanny . I was too . Keep your eye on yourself . Find out who you are . Watch what you do and tell yourself why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been saying something like that to me all my life . It drives me up a wall . Suppose I never find out who I am ? " " Then you 'll have to find out why or pay for it . " " I do n't want to go back to a shrink . " " I was n't talking about shrinks . " " How did you find out you wanted to write biographies ? If I knew what I wanted to do that would be half of it for me . " Dubin said trial and error plus good luck . " I was writing obituaries . Finally I read someone 's life of somebody else and thought I could do better . My wife thought so too . " Fanny yawned and grew quiet . For a minute he thought she had fallen asleep . " What about her ? " she asked . " What about her ? " " Did she know what she wanted to do when she was my age ? " " At your age she was about to be a widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was interested in music but not much came of it . She wanted to teach , she wanted to be a concert harpist , but she did n't do either . She met this doctor and he asked her to marry him . " " I do n't want to get married  --  at least not yet . " " Not yet , " Dubin agreed . " When did she start being afraid she would die of cancer , or something like that ? " " Before I met her . " " Is that the reason she goes around smelling the gas burners ? " " I suppose so . It 's a kind of ritual against death . " " Do you think I have one ? " " I do n't know . Do you have many nightmares ? " " I used to have more when I was a kid . " " Maybe they 're your gas burners . " " Maybe . What are yours ? " " I do n't know . " " What about those long walks you always take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk . " Fanny was silent a moment . " Did Thoreau have a ritual ? I do n't rememberwhether you mentioned it in your book . " " His journal was his ritual . For all I know he may have thrown handfuls of snow over his left shoulder as he was walking in the woods . " " What about D. H. Lawrence ? " " Maybe his tuberculosis was psychosomatic , I do n't know . He would never admit he was seriously ill till after he finished The Plumed Serpent in Mexico . He called his sickness catarrh , bronchitis , influenza , a bad cold , finally malaria  --  everything but the deadly thing it was . He used to say it was n't his lungs , it was his bronchi ; but his lungs were rotting . " " Are you afraid to die , William ? " Fanny asked in the dark . Dubin drew up his knees . " My God , Fanny , how many times are you goingto ask me that ? I do n't want to talk any more . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need sleep desperately . For God 's sake , let me sleep . " " Are you sorry about us now ? " " No . " " Are you glad ? " " Yes . " " Is your wife good in bed , William ? " Fanny then asked . " Lay off , Fanny , " Dubin said irritably . " She would n't want you to know . " " Oh , come off it . " " Obviously she 's different from you . " " How different ? " " That 's none of your business . " " Do you love her  --  this minute ? " " Yes . " " Do you love me ? " " Yes . " " Bullshit . " He waited for her to start punishing him but she had fallen asleep . Dubin could n't till dawn . In the morning Fanny apologized for having kept him awake during the night . She was menstruating heavily . " That 's what gave me those lousy dreams , " she said almost gaily . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p223Sunday  morning Dubin called his wife in Center Campobello from a public pay phone while he was out getting the newspaper . Kitty was angered . " Where in Christ have you been ? I was frantic . You were n't registered at the Gansevoort . They had no idea where you were . " Dubin said he was at the Brevoort . " Why the Brevoort ? You 've never liked it there . " " For a change , " he lied . " Were you calling from Maine ? Is something the matter ? " " We never got to Maine . Maud could n't make it . The night before we were to leave she got a long-distance call from a man she said was a friend , then asked out . She packed a bag and took a bus to New York . I can tell you she stopped being bored in a hurry . " Dubin was worried . " Is she here now ? " " I would imagine so . " " Where is she staying ? " " She has n't called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " " I 'm standing here talking to you . Did she say when she 'd be home ? " " Vaguely  --  about a week . She apologized for having to go . I 'm certainshe 's having an affair . " " You do n't know who he is ? " " No . Questions about her personal life annoy her . " " There are some questions one has to ask . " " Who she may or may not be sleeping with ? You ask her . " " Maybe I will . " " When will you come home ? " " Tomorrow morning . " " I thought you said you 'd be home today ? " " I want to visit my father 's and mother 's graves this afternoon . " " Yes , go , " she said . Dubin asked her to meet him at the train tomorrow noon and Kitty said she would . He said he was sorry he had forgotten to give her the name of the hotel he 'd been staying in . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " On and off . " Hearing that , he laughed nervously . " Pretty good . " Kitty said she was glad.  |p224After  he had brought the paper to Fanny , Dubin hailed a cab to take him to the cemetery in the Bronx where his mother was buried . Her grave was overgrown with thick grass . " Mama , " he said , " rest in , peace in your grave . " Whore else could she rest ? He thought of her jumble of mad fears ; of those he carried in his flesh . He wondered which of them Maud carried in her . Dubin left a stone on the tombstone to let his mother know he had been there . Maybe it was to let himself know . The white stone he had left more than a dozen years ago when he had taken Kitty to visit the grave was still there , the color of rust . It had begun to rain . He stopped off at the cemetery office and told them to cut the long grass on his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the station took a taxi to his father 's cemetery . Charles Dubin had divorced himself from his wife in his grave . Let God take care of her now . His son carried a small leatherboundbook and read from it a Hebrew prayer for the dead transliterated in English . " Rest in peace , Papa , " he said to the wet grave . " You did what you had to . " Dubin imagined nine other men standing at the grave with him , saying Kaddish . He left the endless cemetery and rode the long subway ride back to Fanny 's apartment . When she had returned from Rome she swore off smokingand had taken up Yoga . She wore black leotards with a run down her left thigh as she did her exercises . Fanny had got to a modified headstand , her head resting in a pool of her thick hair , when he entered the apartment . She fell to her knees . Dubin pulled her up and they kissed with open mouths . Her breath was like the scent of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not now , " Dubin said . " Because I 'm bleeding ? " He said he was not much in a mood . He had just been to the cemetery . " Did your wife ever want it when she was bleeding ? " " Ask her . " After a while Fanny said she was sorry she had asked . Her face was pallid and worried . " I was happy all week , " she said to Dubin . " I do n't want to spoil it . "  |p225He  said he did n't want to spoil it either . " Do you honestly like me ? " " Most honestly . " Her eyes softened . " I had a fine time , did you ? " She touched his hand with her finger . " Never better . " " Let 's have more good times , lots of fun . " He said that was what he wanted . " I will give you a key to the downstairs door and one for my apartment . " Dubin said he had better not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyfell out of my pocket , Kitty would want to know what they were for . " Fanny reluctantly saw the point . " Anyway , when will you be back ? I missyou already . " He promised soon . " Oh , make it sooner . We 're lovers now , are n't we ? "  |p226They  made love on a sunny Sunday morning , the moving white curtains enfolding warm light . Afterward Kitty , lying on her side , said the early-fall anemones were especially prettily colored . It was a bright August day thinningtoward autumn . He had made love with her , trying not to think of Fanny . Dubin was conscious of himself lying beside his wife , his left arm around her , hers draped across his belly . Kitty was slender , taller than Fanny , felt lighter , weighed less . Her face was at peace and pretty . Her skin shone in the morning light . He was glad she was satisfied ; wanted her to have what she was entitled to . Forgive me , he thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he had said . She laughed to herself . " What shall I forgive ? " " Who I am . " She had heard it before . " I forgive who you are . " Kitty ruffled his hair , yawned , sat up and reached for her robe . " Let 's have breakfast . " Sunday 's was the breakfast they almost always ate together . On Sundayp227she fixed other than ordinary fare . Today she cooked an omelette aux fines hcrbes . The buttery golden omelette with greens looked succulent in the omelette pan . Biscuits were hot , creamy , coffee tasty . Mt . No Name , through the window behind Kitty , became more clearly visible as summer heat and haze diminished . There were a few yellowing leaves in the silver maples , not many . After a blow of wind a handful of dead leaves lay scattered on the grass . Dubin watched a single leaf , half-green , half-yellow , part from a branch and drift and twirl to the ground . He had always been affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to . Kitty , after pouring second cups of coffee , asked him what his impression had been of Maud 's summer . " What did you talk about with her ? " " Politics often . She was excited by the impeachment proceedings . We both were . " " I mean what did she say that was personal ? " " Not much about herself , " Dubin told Kitty . " She was n't giving much though there were moments she seemed to want to . Once in a while I said something that brought her close  --  not close enough  --  to saying what was on her mind . I had this sense , on her part , of gesture . " " What do you mean ? " " Her visit as a kind gesture to her parents . " " I hope to God she is n't having a bad time . If she 's in love I 'd hate it to be unhappy love . " " Do you think she 's in love ? " Kitty said she thought so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hear her as I go up the stairs . " " Which poems ? " " One I asked about she copied out for me . It 's Mother Juana Ines de la Cruz . She copied it and I learned it : Al que ingrato me deja , busco amante ; al que amante me sigue , dejo ingrata ; constante adoro a quien mi amor maltrata ; maltrato a quien mi amor busca constante . Al que trato de amor , hallo diamante , y soy diamante al que de amor me trata .  |p228When  Kitty recited poetry her voice was sincere , soft , hesitant . Maud recited in a sweet emotional fluent voice . " What does it mean ? " " She says she lovingly seeks the one who ungratefully abandons her ; and he who lovingly pursues her she ungratefully abandons . " Him whom I treat lovingly I find to be hard , and I am hard for him who treats me lovingly . " " It sounds rocky . " " It has a Spanish quality . Her voice sounds Spanishy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice ? " " She 's a surprising girl . " " Has she said who the guy is  --  somebody Spanish or Mexican ? " " Did n't you ask ? " " No . " " He may be , maybe not , I 'm not good at guessing . I hope she 's happy with him . Being in love at her age was a happy time for me . When I woke in the morning I ran to see myself in the looking glass . " Dubin said it was n't a happy time in his life . " When I first met you , you said it was . " " In a way it was . I enjoyed hurrying to their houses with little bouquets of flowers . " " You have n't brought one home in years . " He said the garden was full of flowers . " I felt happy in love until I had to contend with feeling come back to earth . I was by then disenchanted with the one I 'd been in love with and was waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of the affair . " " Why was it a waste ? " " Nothing had come of it . " " Does something have to come of everything ? " He said that was not a bad idea . " What happened to the girl ? " " She went elsewhere . " " I sometimes am surprised that you wanted to marry me . " " I was ready for you . You were right for me with your kind of experience . I felt we were in the real world . "  | " I was n't so sure of that in the beginning . " " I was n't sure of myself as your step-husband . " " Oh , cut it out , " Kitty grimaced . Dubin changed the subject : " I sense Maud has a lot to learn . " " If I could she will , maybe Gerald will too . I hope he 's happy someday . " " I doubt he thinks of happiness . I do n't think it 's on his agenda . " " What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where to ? " " To the next tightrope , from the one over rocks to the one over water . " Kitty 's dark eyes showed concern . " I liked his last card . He seemed to be having a better time . But he never tells us what he 's doing . I hate that kind of gap between son and mother . Do you think he 'll want to come home soon ? " " It 'll depend on what President Ford offers the deserters . He is n't a man with much moral imagination . " " Gerry Willis insists on an apology . He has an intense moral imagination . " " He 's got the makings of a revolutionary . " " What a strange way for one 's own son to be , " Kitty said . " Before you know who he is he 's someone other than you think . " Yet she gave the impression she might square things with Gerald if only he returned to the house for a visit . " I have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I used to . I 'm not as guilty as I used to be . " Despite the uncertainties of Gerry 's life and Maud 's , the worries they kicked up as they defined themselves , lived their experiences , mysteries , Dubin always enjoyed talking about them . Talk was a way of conjuring them up and bringing them close . He often thought of them without worrying about their fates , reflecting on the twists and turns their lives might take before they had settled into vocations  --  when one could see , if not a completelymatured self , at least the self 's direction . He wondered what they would ultimately want to work at , or work in . Maud was interested in many things , none strongly defined except her Spanish . Would she teach ? Ask her what she hoped to do and she grew impatient . " I 'll do something , do n't worry . But do n't expect me to get married after college or go to graduate school . " " What shall I expect ? " " Expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , had always had strong specific interests  --  his math ,  |p230astronomy  , chess , music . Dubin could imagine him in a Swedish institute doing mathematical research . Or moved perhaps by some indefinable impulse , he might , like his father , become a physician . They confided little and asked little , Dubin thought . I hoped they would want to know what I could tell them . I wish I had told them more about my life . " Were we good parents or half-ass ones ? " Kitty said . She asked it in a way that seemingly answered the question . She asked it often . He thought they were n't bad parents but what seemed to count most was who parents were as people , not what they said they were . The more selfconsciousor insistent or private they were , the quicker the kids made tracks into space . " Who you are is the lesson they ingest , resist , live by . " " I ca n't do much about that , " Kitty said , " but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to them . I wanted to but could n't freely . I hid my fears and they knew . But I love them and want their love . I know it 's there , behind the clouds , but I 'd like to feel it on me like the living sun . " " What 's there will show as they come to terms with themselves . " " Let 's not depend on them , " Kitty said . " Let 's depend on each other . " They went for a drive into the mountains that afternoon , Dubin driving . Fall was advanced there . Some branches of sugar maples had turned color from trunk to tip . In a few weeks trees would glow like jewels . He loved the softness , quietude , before the assault of color , the rage of winter . There were blue holes in the changing foliage  --  the sky flowing through trees . " Do you feel how sexy the mountains are as we drive through them ? " Kitty asked . He said he knew what she meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Dubin said she was . That evening they had dinner at the Ondyks ' , with Oscar and Flora . Evan dug out his alto sax and played some songs of the forties . His eyes retained an almost expressionless quality  --  at most a fixed nostalgia  --  but the playing was lively . Kitty sang along with him . Then Oscar went to the piano and played Chopin for a while . He apologized for his piano playing . Flora , sitting close to Dubin , whispered she was sorry she had n't brought her violin . " I sensed I 'd want it with you here . " Kitty , when they arrived home , sat down at her harp and played intensely for ten minutes . In their bedroom she looked at herself in the mirror and said this had been one of their happiest days . Dubin promised many more.  |p231The  biographer , while settling the business of his articles , had managed another short visit to Fanny at the end of August . He had registered at the Gansevoort and spent most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for messages and telephone Kitty from a phone booth if she had called . She called once . Dubin and Fanny were immediately intimate . He was perhaps surprised at how quickly and comfortably they came together , as though he was n't sure he had earned the privilege . He had and he had n't , as when strangers become lovers they remain in part strangers . Or as when married men , having affairs with single women , expect less than total commitment . But Fanny had pronounced them lovers , and coming together in felt acceptance and desire was a happy circumstance . He enjoyedtheir familiar life together . They were friends , more to their relationshipthan sex ; but happily there was sex . Dubin worried that he was seeing her so infrequently . How long would they go on being lovers if she had to wait for him to show up  --  with luck  --  once or twice a month ? He knew she was seeing other men  --  how could he ask her not to ? She had told him , " We go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pick guys who wo n't give me a hard time . One is almost your age , and reminds me of Harvey . I hope you do n't mind ? I also see women I know , one from work , if I feel lonely . " Looking at him openly Fanny asked , " Do you believe me ? " Dubin said he did . They squeezed hands and with serious faces kissed seriously . She hesitantly showed him a term paper she had written for her governmentclass and sat on the bed clipping her toenails as he read it . Dubin told her it was informed and well written . Fanny respected facts and reasoned well . The term paper revealed qualities he had not often observed in her : of knowing more than she seemed to ; of being organized as she thought things through . He said that to her . " Are you surprised ? " " Only a little . " " Are you glad ? " He said he was . " You like me to be a good student ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She laughed happily and offered to go to bed . When he asked her why ,  |p232right  then , Fanny said she felt sexy when he complimented her . They went out for dinner and for a while talked of courses she might take in the fall . She intended , she said , " really " " finally " to get her degree . Dubin ordered a bottle of champagne . Champagne made her feel high , Fanny said . So did music , bright colors , a witty evening , a happy time . They hurried home ; she loved hurrying home to make love . He did too . It was a good way to be . Dubin left on Sunday morning , promising his earliest possible return , thankful she had n't insisted on a secure date to write down . " Let 's say I 'll be back the first chance I have , Fanny . It is n't always easy to get out but I 'll manage . " " It 's cool , " Fanny said . She knew the game , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; putting her out of his mind when the train , its whistle like a sustained organ chord , approached the station where Kitty , sitting in her car , loyally awaited the bull 's return . Dubin lifted his Panama , opened the car door ; they kissed . As they drove home he had to restrain himself from talking about the girl , as if he were expecting his wife to appreciate Fanny 's contribution to his well-being , good life . What " on balance " he owed his wife he would soon repay . He treated her tenderly . These visits to Fanny sparked his work . Ideas swarmed in Dubin 's mind . He was still writing of Lawrence and Frieda during their slow journey on the Continent after their elopement ; their deepening love , celebrated in poems and letters written in Germany , Italy , Sicily , as they lived in a villino amid olive , almond , and lemon trees ; or in a farmhouse on a mountainside . And at last I know my love for you is here ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Strange how we suffer in spite of this ! Dubin worked in the barn study , writing securely and rapidly . Kitty said she would rather he was in the house but would settle for a phone in the barn , " just in case . " " In case what ? " " In case I need you in a hurry . One never knows . " He had a telephone put in . She called rarely  --  once when the tree man wanted to see him : another elm was dying ; once or twice when he had worked long past lunch and she was beginning to be worried.  |p233He  labored steadily . There were no serious distractions . Now and then he would put down his pen to pursue a thought of Fanny  --  usually to relive her looks or body ; or simply enjoy the marvelous fact that William Dubin had , at his age , a vital vivid young friend . Sometimes he searched amid the papers in a folder on his desk for the picture she had recently given him  --  to contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photocopies of the Lawrence correspondence he had discovered in Eastwood , with her short affectionate letters beginning " Dearest William , " and closing with four x 's in place of love . Her handwriting slanted downward . A triangle of bare paper was left at the bottom . Dubin thought he could write a whole letter in it . " When are you coming ? " she wrote . " I am waiting in bed . " She mailed her typed letters without a return address , his name purposely mispelled ; and varied the size and color of the envelope as if to indicate the letters were coming from different people in different places . Dubin rememberedthat Jonathan Swift had instructed Vanessa to have someone else address her letters to him ; but the biographer wanted no part of that . He was surprised by Fanny 's machinations ; had n't asked her to join the deceit ; did not want to share it with her , nor be reminded or informed of her experience with other men . " When are you coming ? A lot is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wasting it . " Once she wrote , " Suppose you got sick , how would I know ? What could I do to see you ? Sometimes I feel as though you are n't in my life . " He wrote her an affectionate letter . In it he said : " I 'm happier now than I 've been in years . There ought to be a way of having other selves to be with those we love . " Now was a new season , unfortunately without her . He would love to point out changes in nature , share them with her if only in Central Park ; but he could not get off to the city . Kitty had insisted she 'd go with him the next time round  --  they 'd drive down together , as he had promised . She knew how thoroughly he had done his research ; how trivial to voyage to New York to squeeze out a minor fact or two in the Public Library when there 'd be many to check after he had completed a full draft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographical articles . If he went to New York now it was mostly as a break ; " for fun , " Kitty said . She could use a little herself . When she asked when he might be going he said he was n't sure . She could go by herself if she liked  --  shop , visit friends , take in a play ; but Kitty saidp234she 'd wait for him . It was more fun going together . Dubin waited : the work was flowing . And he was enjoying hoarfrost mornings before warm tangy autumn days ; burning-leaf smell of trees yellowing in afternoon sun ; a failing luminosity at twilight  --  most beautiful time of year . Melancholy too : signs of winter 's fingers in woods and fields . Landscape as metaphor . Nature repeating the same old tale , usually with same effect ; it plays in memory : what dies is present , what 's present dies . Although he missed Fanny he sometimes thought that so long as they cared for each other , admitted the reality and importance of their relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was his in principle ; he had somehow earned the privilege of her . The mild sadness that went with it  --  dominant emotion of his life , he often thought  --  touched but did not taint his desire for her . Unless it was the unyielding presence of Kitty in his thoughts that salted in the sadness . Then Fanny drove up to Center Campobello one Saturday morning and called from her motel as he was working in the barn . There had been talk she might come up but Dubin had hoped he would be in the city before that . " I 'm here , " she announced , " to see the color and whoever wants to see me . " Her laughter was strained and he imagined her sober expression . Dubin had called her at the beginning of the week to say once more why he was finding it hard to get away ; told her Kitty had insisted on going with him . " I 'll have to drive down once with her and not see you . After that I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we see each other for an hour after I get home from work ? It 's better than not at all . " " I would n't want to leave you with the evening in your lap after we 'd been to bed . " " Let 's take what we can get , William , " Fanny had said . " I feel very generous after I 've been with someone who means a lot to me . " He had said he 'd tell Kitty they 'd be coming down next week . But Fanny had n't waited . She had felt like driving up , she said . " Ca n't we meet tonight ? I 'd love to eat with you , then come back here . I have a nice room in this motel . They have cotton sheets on the bed . Some private people own it . It even has curtains and white window shades . I 'll bet you like it . He said after a minute he would try to arrange it . " One way or the other.  |p235But  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't plan on that . I 'm usually home all day Sunday . " " Not even in the morning ? I plan to leave by one o'clock . I 'm having dinner with my friends in the Village who I told you about . " In the afternoon Dubin went for a drive and called Kitty to say the car had broken down . He was at a garage in Glens Falls and would have to wait until they got the part they needed from a neighboring town . " Do n't wait for me . I 'll pick up a sandwich across the street . " " I hate to eat alone , " Kitty said . Dubin felt shame ; he said nothing . " Maybe it 's time to trade in this lousy car for a new one ? " He said they ought to consider it . He met Fanny at the motel . They ate an early dinner in a nearby inn and returned to her room . She pulled down the shades and asked to be undressed . They made love impetuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the aromas of her hair and flesh . She liked him to kiss the dark aureoles of her nipples . " William ! " she cried as she came . Dubin fell through the sensuous sky into a mountain of leaves , bounced once , and fell peacefully asleep . " Wo n't you see me for a little bit tomorrow ? " Fanny asked . " Even an hour would be all right . " He promised he would . She held up her hands to show him she was growing back her fingernails . He kissed both hands . On Sunday Dubin rose early , left Kitty sleeping heavily and drove to the motel to have breakfast with Fanny . He had scribbled his wife a note saying he had written something that had come apart during the night and he had to puzzle out why . He was taking an early drive and would be back in time for lunch . He disliked what the note said but left it anyway . After they had made love , as she was sitting cross-legged in bed , Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing , or what you 're doing , but whatever it is hits me right . I felt this one today way up my ass . " " Bingo . " Fanny laughed . " We 're good together . " " Is that what it is ? Has n't this happened to you before ? " " Not often . Only once or twice I can remember . "  | " I 'm glad it happens when you 're with me but I marvel a little . " " Maybe it 's because of the way you want it . I dig the hungry way you go after me . " " You make me feel hungry . I have a long pleasure with you , on the edge of pain . Is it simply that we physically suit each other ? " " It has to be more than that , " Fanny replied . " I think I come the way I do because I like myself better when I am with you . " Dubin kissed her knees . " If we have it this good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's crazy not to see each other a lot more than we do ? " He said they would . She placed her warm palm on his . He did not have to lie to Kitty when he arrived home shortly before noon . She had n't seen the note and he tore it up . She had taken a sleeping pill in the middle of the night and was awakening as he came into the bedroom and raised the shades . " Why did n't you wake me to eat with you ? " Kitty said drowsily after glancing at the clock . He said he had wanted her to sleep . She shook him out of solid slumber . He woke with a long-drawn groan . She had had a mad dream  --  could not remember worse : She was a young woman with a baby in a crib . The crib was in flames . It had taken her an endless time to find the burning child 's room . She had heard it shrieking and raced up the stairs . Kitty grabbed up the baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it in the shower , but the door was locked . William , let me in ! She hastened from room to room , trying to find him , sick with fright . It occurred to her the child was Nathanael 's and she ran to the telephone to call him but Nathanael was in his grave . Kitty had wakened , trying to remember whether she had fainted in the dream . Dubin held her till she stopped shuddering . He asked her what was worrying her . " I do n't know , " Kitty said , " except a confusing lot of ongoing things . Neither of the kids is nearby or settled . I worry about them . I also worry about Vietnam . I hate the goddamn war . I think I will stop watching the news at night  --  those burning children running across the road . No wonder I have nightmares . "  |p237Dubin  told Kitty in their austere high-ceilinged room at the Gansevoort that he would meet her for dinner at half past seven , or eight . Would she want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , " Kitty said , " I 'm famished by eight . We 'll see about the movie . We might want to do something else . " He told her he was having a drink with a biographer of Frieda Lawrence . " Anyone I know ? " " Have you met Fritz Halsman ? " He knew no Fritz Halsman and was surprised and irritated by the sincerity of his question . " No . Why do n't you invite him to dinner with us if he 's free ? " " Maybe next time . He 's not that interesting . I 'm only checking a point with him . " Kitty was wearing a new fall dress with a cloche hat . She looked good in hats that framed the face . She had enjoyed the drive and said they ought to come into the city more often . " Why bother living in the country ? " " New York was no decent place to bring up children . We both thought so years ago . " Dubin left quickly to say nothing else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab he sat silent as the driver talked . Dubin got to Fanny 's as she was arriving in a taxi . They kissed in the street . " How much time do we have ? " she asked . " About two hours . " " Then we do n't have to hurry . " She had her diaphragm on , had been wearing it since that morning . Upstairs she showed him a pair of lace-edged underpants she had bought during her lunch hour . " Let 's get into bed , " said Dubin . " I knew you 'd like them , " Fanny said . Dubin was back at the hotel at 7:40 , going on about the war ending soon . Then he warned himself to shut up . He had showered at Fanny 's and was about to change his underwear when it occurred to him the shorts he kept in her dresser drawer were striped , whereas the pair he had been wearing were a solid blue . When he got back to the hotel he changed his underclothes and shirt in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . He used Kitty 's soap.  |p238Their  dinner was excellent . He enjoyed his wife 's wit and flushed good looks . She wanted to return to their room after dinner but he talked her into going to a movie that had just opened . On their way home the next morning , Kitty driving , chatty , Dubin quiet , barely aware of scene or sight , he worried about the spreading dishonesty he was into . Awful , if you thought of yourself as an honest man . You spoke pebbles and pieces of metal and when you determined to say honest words you kept spitting out bits of brackish metal . Since lying was beyond Kitty , or she beyond it , lying to her tainted his pleasure with Fanny , at least in afterthought . Kitty was trustworthy ; Dubin hated to think he was n't . Of course he could tell her the truth and hope for the best . Some men were able to inform their wives and still manage to carry on an affair . But Kitty would n't tolerate it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together if she knew . She was n't constituted for an emotionally , not to say morally , ambiguous relationship . To protect her peace of mind he had to lie though he wanted to protect her from his lies . Nor did he intend , at least yet , to give up Fanny . At times he wondered if his deceit to Kitty might induce dishonesty in his work . The thought bothered him although he knew enough about the lives of writers to understand that even the morally deficient might write well . So he kept his sad secret , recalling that Freud had said no one could keep a secret forever . " If his lips are silent his fingertips give him away . " Yet he concealed his thoughts of Fanny ; disguised details of other trips to the city ; received letters from her in a post-office box he had recently rented . He called her once a week and she , him , more often , on his barn telephone ; but there were times she would try to reach him in the house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . Dubin only rarely telephonedher at work . At night , if Kitty answered , Fanny hung up . Kitty reached for the phone when it rang . If he answered but could n't speak to Fanny because his wife was there , Dubin hung up . " Who was that , William ? " " Wrong number probably , somebody rang off . " " We 've had a spate of hang-ups lately . " " They come and go . There seems to be a season for them . " He asked Fanny not to call him at home . " Then when can we talk ? " she asked angrily . " If I ca n't get you in the barn in the morning because I am too busy to sneak in a call , that means I ca n't talk to you at all when I havep239something to tell you . I save most of my news to tell you . I 'm taking environmental studies and psychology at N.Y.U. three nights a week . I wanted to talk about what I was writing in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also think of us in bed . Do you suppose we could go to Europe again ? I 'm getting two weeks off this winter  --  they 're not giving me a summervacation , because I am new . But my boss says they like me and I make up time when I come in late . They like it that I 'm going to school at night . I might get a raise the first of the year . " " Europe would be different this time , " Dubin felt . " If there had n't been a last time there would n't be a this time , " Fanny said . He said he was n't thinking of last time . " I was thinking we might go to Athens if I could come up with a good enough reason why , like maybe a cache of unpublished Lawrence letters had been discovered there  --  " " Why do n't you put your mind to it ? " He said he would think about it . They arranged he would telephone her from the barn twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not call him unless it was absolutely necessary . When he phoned before eight she was usually alert , eager to talk , had much to say and said it warmly . Dubin would walk across the hoarfrost field to call her , then return for a second cup of coffee and to shave . He would afterward trot off to the barn to do his day 's work . Fanny once in a while phoned in mid-morning to say a quick hello . One early morning when he thought Kitty was sleeping , she was watching him cross the field to call Fanny , as a crow circled overhead cawing at him . At lunch she asked why he went to the barn so early , then returned to the house before going out again . He said that if he first set up the day 's work it made breakfast more serene . Dubin groaned softly in her presence . " What 's up , William ? Is something troubling you ? " He did not at once reply but , when he saw the worry in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " I thought I heard you say ' deceit , ' " she said . " That was the word on my mind . " " Did Lawrence ever deceive Frieda ? "  |p240She  often guessed where his thoughts were . Dubin told her that with Lawrence the deceit went the other way . " Frieda had deceived Weekley , her first husband , with at least two lovers . Lawrence she deceived mostly with Angelo Ravagli , their Italian landlord , who became her third husband . Once she traveled on the Continent with John Middleton Murry , but he said he turned her down because he did n't want to betray Lawrence . Some say they did sleep together . My own guess is they did n't while Lawrence was alive . I do n't think Murry lied when he wrote he had n't slept with her then because he did n't want to betray Lawrence . " " How complicated it is . " Dubin said it was . " Do you think I might be deceiving you ? " Kitty asked with a faint smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaving , that end-of-October weekend , for New York , a year almost to the day when he and Fanny had flown to Venice . " This is a quickie trip , " he explained to Kitty . " I 'll be gone Friday and part of Saturday . I should be back by early evening . " " Why ca n't I come ? " " I 'll be going again in two or three weeks to attend other business . Come with me then , it 'll be a longer weekend . " " Why are you going now ? " He said he wanted someone who knew wills to look at theirs and suggest changes . " We wrote it when the kids were young . " " Do n't you remember enough law to read a will ? " " Not as much as you think . " " Why do n't you do the will when you go next time ? What 's so important right now ? " " Offices are closed on Saturdays and Sundays . I can see someone late this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't want to . " I 've mailed the will out , a friend of mine has read it , I want to talk to him about changing it . " Her eyes were troubled . " Why are you suddenly concerned about a will ? There 's nothing wrong with you , is there ? " " No , " Dubin said , sweating . " I happened to come across it in our safety deposit box and thought I ought to have it checked out . A legal instrument should be kept up to date . "  |p241She  said talk of the will had worried her . Dubin swore there was nothing wrong with him . He was irritated with himself for fabricating the will . Ultimately he was able to lie with less guilt . He geared himself to it : had to protect his relationship with Fanny , at the same time not hurt Kitty . Still , he would n't eat his heart out over every fib he told . Not all evil is pure evil . Not all lies are forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanny , for which he blessed her , he felt a surge of love for his wife , followed by a saddening sense of loss  --  awareness of an illusion he seemed to favor : that as he fulfilled himself he did the same for Kitty . That was not true in any way . He had experienced pleasure he would like her to experience , dish her out a bit of pure lustful joy ; but if another woman was the source of his pleasure  --  if you lived on her body  --  that diminished desire , affectionobligation  --  forthe other , the wife . He continued to hide from Kitty his feeling for Fanny , his happy involvement with her ; but it did not hide well . The Freudian fingertips showed : because of Fanny he was a different man , had grown new attributes , elements of a new self  --  how could you hide that ? You pretended you were your old self , but the old self had changed . You pretended it had n't , adding to pretense . Kitty , he knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost with compassion , as if he had come back with a wound and only she knew it . She asked him again if he was well . Dubin said that next time a will or something of the sort came up he 'd take care of it without mentioning it to her . " No , " she said , " you must tell me . " Nothing was wrong with him , Dubin insisted . " Do n't worry about what does n't exist . " " I wo n't if you promise not to hide from me what does . " She laughed breathlessly , her eyes not looking at him . If she believed him with reservation , what , Dubin wondered , did she not believe ? Had she sensed some sort of withdrawal from her ? Something more serious  --  of another kind than had happened last winter ? It was months since Fanny and he had become lovers ; does n't an experience of love produce a newly experiencing self ? All the exciting new sex diminishing the less exciting sex , the lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty and her husband lived as married ,  |p242but  Fanny had joined the merry company . Dubin has two wives ? Here 's Kitty gazing out of a window reflecting herself , and beholds , in the wood in the distance , the shadow of a presence ; aware of something not fearsomebut a source of fear ? Dubin , staring through the same glass , sees himself in view , Fanny , in white , standing dimly by his side , all but invisible . He searches the glass , amidst images of leafy trees and darkening shallow clouds , for Kitty , expecting her to be reflected nearby ; but she stands alone , amid tall trees , in the deeper distance . What it amounts to , the biographer thinks , is that one may be able to mask dishonesty but not its effects : the diminution of libido , ebb of feeling for a woman , love for her . Deceit distances . He dreamed of Kitty pacing the black-railed widow 's walk on the roof . Dubin had caught a cold that became heavy bronchitis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He called Fanny very early one morning , as Kitty slept , to say he could n't possibly be going down this week . Fanny said she would drive to Center Campobello , but Dubin in his laryngitic voice told her he was reasonably sure he could make it to her after another week . Kitty then caught Dubin 's cold , and since the trip was promised to her , he felt he ought n't to go alone this time . It snowed a few days before Thanksgiving , a light snow that melted in a day as though a dropped handkerchief had been snatched up . Fanny urged Dubin to come by himself  --  he had a perfect excuse with Kitty ill ; but he said it was getting more difficult to lie his way into the city so often . " What 's so often about coming here a month ago ? I thought you had the excuse of talking to a lawyer about something ? " He said it was n't a good one . " And it is n't like me to take off for New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods are full of them here . I do n't travel much in wintertime . " " Would n't it be groovy if we could fuck by phone , " she said bitterly . Dubin was silent . " What I mean , " Fanny said after a moment , " is I miss you . When I get lonely I feel like crawling up a wall . If you ca n't come here , William , I 'll zip up there . I bought snow tires and I 'd like to come up this next weekend . " " There 's at least one dinner date this weekend . Could you make it the one after ? "  | " Are you sure you really want me to come ? Sometimes I have the feeling you do n't care all that much . " " You 'd be wrong , " he said . " I 'm ready to drive up any weekend if you ca n't come to me . If we do n't get together one way we have to another or what 's our life all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has inspired some beautiful poetry . " " I do n't write poetry , I never could . " " Let 's try to be together every third weekend or so , though please keep in mind I have no good reason suddenly to be out alone any given night of any particular weekend , let alone two nights in a row . It 's not usual . " " I think you have a damn good reason . " " I know I have , but unfortunately not one I can give my wife . " " Unfortunately , old boy . " " I do n't want to hurt anyone , little girl . " " I 'm not your little girl and you are hurting me . " " I do n't want to hurt you , Fanny . " " Other men get out from under their wives  --  why ca n't you ? " Dubin explained that he 'd worked home for years . " It 's hard to find excuses to get out alone when circumstances change . Though in a way it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one works in a room with the door shut and everyone knows where he is and expects him to be there for all time . Between biographies I am freer . " Fanny 's tone softened . " Could n't you please try to come here ? You said your wife 's cold is about gone . I 'd rather have you come here than go to that lousy motel . " " I thought you liked it ? " " I like it when you 're in my apartment with me  --  in my bed . I like to share my home with you as well as my ass . Why do n't you move to New York so we can see each other easier and more often ? " " I 've thought about it but it 's not feasible right now . Kitty dislikes the city . " " Why do n't you do what you want ? " " Some things you want to do you do n't . " " I would n't live that way . " But she called him in the barn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got a week of her vacation shifted from January to Decemberand had decided to spend the time in Center Campobello . " Can you swing that in mid-week for a day or two or three  --  not next week but the one after ? " " Make it for the one after , " Dubin said . " We 'll see each other as often as we can but I imagine you realize we wo n't be able to meet every day while you 're here ? I hope you 'll be understanding and flexible about that . " " We could also meet in the afternoon . We can go on your walk together . I 'd meet you at the bridge and we could walk together most of the way . " He said he would enjoy that . " But what about seeing each other inti-mately ? " " Could n't I stay in your barn with you  --  not when you 're working but at least part of the time ? " Dubin was about to tell her he could n't risk it , then felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ; could go nowhere without informing someone . " Let 's try , " he said . " I 've got a sofa convertible to a bed in my study . But we 'll have to be very careful . " She promised she would be . In the week she was in town Fanny and Dubin spent more time together than he would have predicted . She registered at the motel but at night would leave her car on the road to the old Wilson farm by Kitty 's Wood . After Dubin had walked the snowy path with her once , she would go along it alone with a flashlight , to the field where the barn stood . He left the study heated for her and she waited till he had trudged back from the house after supper . They were happy to see each other . In dungarees , flannel shirt , boots , she looked like another Fanny , a young woman he had just met he was about to fall in love with . She grasped his hands ; they kissed , fumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventure of going through the wood , of being with him here . It did n't bother her to be near his wife in the house , although it worried Dubin . To get out tonight , he told Kitty he had reached a crucial point in the biography  --  he went into a discourse of how bad the marriage of Frieda and Lawrence was when they were fighting about her desire to see her three children . Lawrence jealously wanted her not to see them . They quarreled , were murderous to each other . Frieda broke a plate over his head . Lawrence smashed one phonograph record after another on hers . Dubin saidp245it would be helpful if he could put in a few nights of steady work and knock off this chapter  --  write four or five pages a day instead of the usual two or two and a half . " You 're crazy , " said Kitty , " to work all morning , then work again at night . " " Just this week  --  less than a week . I 've done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's mad . " " Why do n't you pick a couple of nights for whatever you want me to do with you and leave the rest for me ? " " Have some nights , " Kitty said . " I 'm Queen of the Night and dispense them like peanuts . " " Do n't get sore . " " Why do n't you at least work in the house ? " He said she knew why : everything was in the barn  --  his books and notes . Afterward Kitty quietly said she was sure she could find something to do with herself and Dubin thanked her . He felt more daring than he 'd been in years . One had to be daring before it was too late . He was almost fifty-eight hurrying toward sixty . Every year was a cheat , piling up age , reducing vitality . Still , he felt youthful and was sorry Kitty did not . After Fanny and he had made love and had listened , as they lay warmly in bed , to music on her portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went through the woods to her car . Fanny said the woods scared her but she would n't let Dubin accompany her to the road . " It 's easier to spot two people than one . " " Nobody can see us walking through the woods from the house , " Dubinsaid . " From the bedroom one can barely see the barn and not much of thewoods . From Maud 's room and my study you can see more . " " Can she see me leave the barn ? " " Not if you go out the study door . Certainly not in the dark . " " Let 's do n't take the chance , " Fanny said . After she had gone Dubin removed the bedsheet and reassembled the sofa . He looked for articles of dress or jewelry Fanny might have left behind , discovered her comb , hid it , and went back to the house . Before getting into bed with his wife he took a shower . Dubin lay up against Kitty 's warm body , his arm over her hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " she yawned.  | " Toward midnight . " " Are you smiling ? " " No . " " I thought I could feel you smile on my shoulder . How did the work go ? " " Fine . " " Why do you shower every night ? " " It relaxes me . " " Do you want to make love ? " " Do you ? " " I will if you want to . " " No . " " You 're not depressed ? " " No . " She fell asleep . In a few hours she would wake , counting the failures of her life . Holding her , Dubin slept . He felt her waken but slept on . Fanny had arrived on Monday . He did not see her Tuesday but they talked on the phone . On Wednesday night Kitty went with Marisa Ondyk to a high school chorale , and Dubin met Fanny at the motel . They had drinks and later went through the wood to the barn and set up the sofa bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know I do . " " Why do n't you say it ? " " Because you know . " " I like you to say it , " Fanny said . Dubin promised he would . " Why do you love me ? " " Because you 're a lovely lay . " " Is that all ? " " Because I love you . " " Why ? " " Because you 're Fanny , named out of Jane Austen . Because of youraffectionate nature . Because you want to make something of your life . " " You make me want to , William . You make me take myself seriously . " He said that was good . " We are good together , " she sighed . " Do n't you think so ? " He said he did.  | " But I 'm not living my life to learn lessons , " Fanny said . " Most of all I want to enjoy it . " He wanted her to . " What are you thinking about ? " " You . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you enjoying it with me ? " " All the way . " It was snowing heavily and when Dubin saw it come down he was concernedabout her driving in the snow at night . He asked her to sleep in his study and leave early in the morning . " You ought to leave before seven . I 'll drive around to the road and shovel you out if you 're blocked in by snow after the road 's been plowed . " " I can shovel myself out , I 'm strong . " " Have you got a shovel ? " Fanny laughed to herself . " I 'll bring one next time . " " I 'll shovel you out at seven if you 're blocked in . " Dubin slept badly . He worried about her but when he got up at six the next morning he saw through the bathroom window that the snow had stopped . Later he found Fanny 's path from the barn and ran in it to the edge of the wood , kicking up her tracks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Thursday it was snowing as they lay in the sofa bed . Lorenzo was with them . Dubin had him in the barn because some field mice had chewed up several of his note cards . Lorenzo lay on the bed , noisily licking himself . Fanny said she was leaving Saturday morning . He was n't sure he could see her on Friday night but they would meet in the city in two or three weeks . Their relationship had deepened . Each probed the other 's needs . What he desired she gave him ; she got what she seemed to want . After they had made love Fanny got out of bed and went naked to the sink . She drank a glass of water and brought him one . " What for ? " " To drink , lover . Are n't you thirsty ? " Lover ' is an old-fashioned way of addressing a lover . " " In certain ways I am old-fashioned . Do you want the water ? " Dubin drank it . Neither Kitty nor he brought each other water after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot shower ; Fanny drank a glass of water and used the wet corner of a towel to wash herself . In the dark he thought of her as his wife . They 'd live in New York . He would work in their apartment while she attended school . She could prepare for serious work of some sort once she knew what interested her . Maybe she could do something part-time if they were married . She could have kids if she wanted ; he imagined she would . She had said she would in one of her letters . It might be hectic but she was a young woman and he would help where he could . Dubin would n't mind having young children again . He thought he 'd be better with them than he 'd been the first time . Children were strangers you loved because you could love . If they gave back love when they were grown you were ahead of the game . You had had them because you thought you could love . He felt Fanny would be happy with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband thirty-five years older than she . He would value her as she ought to value herself , perhaps help her unravel some of the distortions of her life . He imagined what she would look like at thirty , when he was sixty-five . Dubin liked what he imagined . Lives ought to begin again around fifty , he thought . Middle age can stand new enterprises , new beginnings . Some marriages go on too long . If they ended by mutual consent after twenty-five years , or when the kids left the house , that might be refreshing for both partners . Getting into the world again to find out what was going on might do them good . Maybe Kitty would worry less about herself if she had to work ; would sleep better ; think less of illness , the garbage of the past . She 'd get the house , of course . Fanny and he could live in Europe for the first year  --  maybe to try out living together . That might ease the transition into a new life for them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are a loving friend . " " We are more than friends now . " " We are also good friends , " Dubin said . " We really could be , " said Fanny . " I thought we were ? " " If we were living together . I liked coming home from work and you were there . " " We ca n't now , I 'm married . " She said after a minute , " Suppose you were n't any more ? "  | " But I am , " Dubin said . Fanny got up for a glass of water and did not bring him one . He asked if she would care to see him tomorrow night . " I thought you did n't think we ought to meet Friday ? " Dubin said he had changed his mind . " We can be together without going to bed . " After a few minutes Fanny asked , " Should we have another lay before Igo ? " He did n't think so . Dubin kissed her mouth and she kissed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Friday was a clear cold night . As they were comfortably together in bed Dubin got up to go to the toilet . Standing there , he saw through the freezing window a flicker of light amid the silver maples and watched with concern . The light disappeared at intervals and grew brighter as it moved in his direction . " She 's coming , " he called hoarsely to Fanny . " Grab your clothes  --  everything  --  getinto the barn . " Fanny leaped out of bed , hastily gathered her clothes , boots , and portable radio , then hurried naked into the barn . Dubin had his trousers and shirt on . He stepped into loafers , pulled the sheet off the bed , threw it into the barn after Fanny , slammed the door shut , and closed the sofa bed . He saw her sweater on his worktable and tossed it behind some file boxes on one of the bookshelves . " William ? " Kitty knocked on the door . " Yes ? " " It 's me . Can I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to unlatch it . " The furnace has pooped out , " Kitty said , stepping into the study . " I was reading in bed , wondering if you 'd ever come home and felt myself getting awfully chilly . When I looked at the thermostat it was fifty so I came to tell you . " Did you call the furnace guy ? " " He comes faster for you . " " You could have phoned me from the house and not frozen your ass coming here in this cold . "  |p250Kitty  looked around the room . She was wearing a heavy cloth coat , boots , and Dubin 's red wool hat . " Was your light out for a while ? I was in Maud 's room and could see no reflection of light in the snow . " " I had a headache and was resting my eyes in the dark . " " Why did n't you quit , for Pete 's sake ? It 's mad to work as much as you 've been this week . " " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wait till tomorrow ? " " I want to get it done . " " What 's that strange odor in here ? " Kitty asked , breathing in , exhaling . " I passed gas . " " It 's not that . " " I smoked a cigarillo . " " It 's not that either . The room smells sexy . " " I was thinking of Faye Dunaway . I was also thinking of Marilyn Monroe . " " Do n't take your headache out on me , William , " Kitty said . " It 's your own bloody fault . " He said he was being funny . The cat meowed in the barn . " Is Lorenzo hungry ? " " I fed him . " Lorenzo meowed as though wailing . Kitty pulled the door open and shone her flashlight in the dark . " What 's that sheet doing on the floor ? " Dubin tried to think but could n't . He was watching Kitty 's light move along the sidewall of the barn to the bolted double doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , furniture she had discarded , tractormower , bags of peat moss . " Was that something moving ? " He did n't think so . " Lorenzo 's been sleeping on the sheet . It needs washing . I was going to bring it home . " Lorenzo , eyes glowing , carne running in the light . If he says anything , the biographer thought , I 'll bash his head in . " What 's the matter with him ? " Kitty asked . " He wants company , he 's tired of mice . "  |p251Dubin  had picked up the phone and was dialing . He told the repairman his furnace had gone on the blink and he was afraid the house pipes would freeze if something was n't done quickly . The man reluctantly said he would come over . " He 'll be over in ten minutes , " Dubin told Kitty . " Please let him in . I 'll knock off my last paragraph and go home . " " I 'd still like to know what the smell in this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " You 're not exactly endearing tonight . " Dubin rubbed his eyes . Kitty left the barn , slamming the door . Through the toilet window he watched her going back in the snow until the light disappeared . He wondered if she had noticed Fanny 's boot tracks . Then he sat down on the sofa , sickened . He felt cold . Fanny came into the room with her dungarees and bra on . She was barefoot and cold , her face without color . " I was scared shitless , " she said . " I thought I had broken my ankle . It hit something and hurt like hell . " He inspected her bruised blue ankle . " Does it still hurt ? " " It feels as if someone drove a nail into it . " Dubin said he was sorry . He still felt nauseated , half frozen . " I do n't want to have to do anything like that again , William , " Fanny said . " I do n't want to have to hide from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it , William . " " There wo n't be a next time , " Dubin said . " I wo n't hide from her again , " Fanny said , her eyes taut . He said he would see her in the city . One Sunday Kitty rose early , dark-eyed and tight-lipped . She stretched her arms limply . When she had left the bed she removed her nightgown , slowly scratched her blemished buttock . At breakfast he noticed her lusterless eyes and formal anxious altered voice . Her tight control tightened him . Kitty mulled over things till she had something : she put two and two together and usually came close to four . Had she now come up with Fanny in his life ? He asked if she had had a bad dream.  |p252Kitty  was gazing at the fried egg on her plate . She 'd hardly touchedbreakfast . They were at the table together but she sat at the table alone . Dubin spoke soberly : " Why do n't you tell me what 's bothering you ? " She said she hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's something physical ? " She looked at her plate . " I 'm sure you 'll say it 's nothing . " " You think it 's cancer ? " he asked , beginning to eat his fried egg . Kitty told him her left nipple had altered in size and she had found a mucus stain in her brassiere . " Do you think it 's cancer ? " " It could be , " she said unhappily . " What else could it be ? " Dubin dipped his bread into the egg yolk . " I do n't know . For God 's sake do n't start preaching at me . I hate it when you righteously preach . " She was frightfully tight . He changed his tone . " Have you felt a lump ? " " No , " she said tensely . " Is the breast sore ? " She nodded , not crying , though her eyes were moist . He sipped his coffee . Dubin then put his cup down and got up and kissed her . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to see if he thought otherwise . " What makes you say so ? " " No lumps . " He said she ought to see the doctor anyway . " Once you 're on a cancer kick , it 's wise to . " Kitty said she would , then confessed that even the thought of a mammogramfrightened her . " I 'll go with you , " he said . " No , I 'll go alone , " Kitty said . " I always have . " On Tuesday she visited the surgeon in Center Campobello , who said it was not cancer . He said it was a papilloma , a nodule he located close to the surface of the breast near the nipple . Kitty afterward told Dubin that the surgeon had said a papilloma was usually benign and he thought he could treat it in his office . A week later  --  she had been calm since seeing him  --  he made the incision . After a biopsy , which revealed no sign of malignancy , Kitty gave out a sob of relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she embraced Dubin and said she loved him very much . She moved gingerly but freely , as though she was freep253of dread yet was worried for having once more tried her fate . How many more times could she do it and still escape cancer ? Dubin , as he combed his hair before the mirror , said he was glad it had come to nothing . " It was n't exactly nothing , " Kitty said . " He removed a nodule that was blocking the duct . That was n't nothing , and it was n't my imagination . " He admitted it . " You look critical ? " " I 'm not but it was n't cancer . The average is still in your favor . " " I 'll bet you were n't in the least worried , " Kitty said , brushing her eyelids with a tissue . " You did n't seem to be . I 'll bet you were thinking about your friend Lawrence and the mystique of the female breast in Indian cow worship . Or maybe you were thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 'd been thinking mostly of Fanny . " That was your sixth or seventh cancer scare since I 've known you , " Dubin said . " I expected nothing serious . " " My mother had cancer . You may be wrong someday . " He said he hoped he would n't be . Kitty that night suggested making love " in celebration , " and he offered the next night , said he was worn out . " My problems ? " " Mine . " In the morning she seemed distant to him . He felt distant from her . It seemed to Dubin he felt more affection for her when Fanny was around . When she was , Kitty was often in his thoughts , tenderly at times . With Fanny gone he was constantly thinking of her . That he was working well was not surprising because his mood was good . He lived much in his thoughts of his developing work and in long reveries of Fanny . Dubin invented and discarded reasons to take off for New York . It irritated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience the girl . The next night he made love to his wife . She had n't wanted to , but responded to his impulse . He was careful not to touch her healing breast . To heighten their pleasure Dubin tried one of the things Fanny had taught him . " Where did you pick that up ? " Kitty wanted to know . " Do you like it ? " " I 'm not sure . I think so . "  | " Do you object ? " " No . " Afterward she asked , " Where did you pick up that little adventurous bit you tried tonight ? " " From a book I read . " " What made you read that kind of book ? " He was about to say he was human . Dubin said , " To bring something new to our sex lives . " " Do you have any complaints about me ? " Kitty asked . He said he had n't . " I 'll bet you do . Nathanael thought I was pretty good in bed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " One responds differently to different people , " Dubin said . " He was yourfirst husband . I 'm your second and for too long I was your step-husband . " " If you say step-husband ' again I swear I 'll leave you . " Her voice quaveredwith anger . He pictured her leaving ; probably she would ask him to leave . The next day Kitty , as she was dressing , quietly asked Dubin if he wanted a divorce . " I do n't think you want or need me any more . I sense it . If something has gone wrong why do n't you tell me ? Have you met someone you 'd rather be with ? " Dubin said he had n't . " Is that girl you went to Venice with still around ? " He said she was n't . " Who was she ? " He would rather not say . " Do I know her ? " He would rather not say . " Then I do and she 's around , " said Kitty . " I sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the matter with you . What 's made you so unresponsive these last few months ? Are we about to go through another awful winter ? Why has my husband become my second cousin once removed ? Removed is the word . We never talk any more . I do n't really know what 's happening to you . Tell me what 's happening to you ? Have you been sleeping with Flora ? " He said that had happened once . " Then what 's eating you , for Christ 's sake ? "  | " Maybe it 's marriage . Sometimes I feel boxed in , unfree . " " Boxed in , how ? " " A long marriage gets hard to take . You must feel it yourself . " He was thinking of her sameness , dissatisfactions , eccentricities . He was bored with her fears , her unforgotten unforgettable past . " What do you mean ' unfree ' ?  --  unfree for what ? " " To forget for ten minutes that I 'm married . " " That sounds like more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel unmarried . What is your need ? " Dubin did n't say . " Would n't a divorce make you feel happier , freer ? " " No , " he said , but his heart was gladdened by the thought . Kitty criticized his nature  --  Dubin 's sobriety , sameness , inability to enjoy life . She said she enjoyed life . " Until we met , you lived on romantic dreams , on nothing really . Now your devotion is work . Your work is all you think of and then you complain you are n't free . " Kitty spoke bitterly , her hands nervously in motion . She had slept with a bracelet on he had once given her . She had dressed and looked good though her eyes were angry . Dubin , raising his voice , accused her of having depreciated his love for her . " You were n't satisfied with what I had to give  --  what I gave you . You had to define it to death . The day we were married you began to educate me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on telling me what I was giving and what I was n't . I gave with feeling and you gave it a name . " " I wanted it to be a strong enduring love , in and of this world . I had experienced a strong loving love . I wanted what I needed . I had to tell you . " " Love was love to me . It needed not defining but nurturing . It wanted a life of its own . It did n't need Nathanael for company or comparison , or you dissecting it . " He was n't certain what he was saying , that he was telling the truth about the past . He was trying to but it seemed , in their quarrel , impossible to recall exactly ; to say what had truly happened to them . Or exactly what was happening now . How can you define the truth if you ca n't tell it ? How can you tell the truth if you begin with lies ? Kitty said , " I was n't doubting you  --  for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was trying to understand your feelings , your nature , my own . I wanted deep whole lasting love . I ca n't keep myself fromp256analyzing or defining . I am not Frieda Lawrence . I am not your earth mother . " She wept copiously , in a low wail . " You 'll leave me , I know in my heart . " Dubin told her not to cry . He racked his brain thinking how not to fail her yet go on with Fanny . Then he put his arms around Kitty . " Let 's get into bed . " She raised her tear-stained face . " Why ? " " I want you . " " I just got dressed . " She slowly removed her clothes . He tried not to notice her aging body , tried not to think of Fanny 's youth . In bed Dubin 's flesh failed him . He was unable to perform . He lay back frustrated , told himself not to be alarmed . Kitty , lying on her pillow , wondered if it was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce upset you ? " He said it was n't her fault , yet hoped it was . " These things happen . Do n't be upset . " " It had n't happened to me before . " " It 's an incident , it 's not for all time . " He said he hoped not ; he was too young for that . " Lawrence was impotent at forty-two , but he was a sick man . " " Do n't think of it . " Afterward Kitty told him she 'd been seeing Evan Ondyk again , and Dubin was sorry for her and for himself . " I was thinking of going away for a while , " she said . " Maybe for a week  --  at the most , two . I 'll go see Gerald in Stockholm . " He thought it would be a good thing for her to do . " I should be myself when you get back . " " Do n't worry about it , " Kitty said calmly . " You 've been ever so much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-eight , yet on the whole he functioned well . " Dubin said he was n't worried . The cold rose in an almost invisible haze from the icy ridged road . The low still polar sky was white as far as he could see . A light snow had struck the hills and whitened the surrounding fields . Nature shrouded , playing dead . Dubin , as he walked , lived in his frozen thoughts . Was that Oscar Greenfeldp257ahead , plodding past the abandoned farmhouse down the road ? The biographerwalked on , heavily clothed , not attempting to catch up with the flutist . Dubin wore two scarves , his tan-and-black over a thick black scarf , waffle stompers , earmuffs under his red wool hat . He tried to think what he 'd been thinking of but now and then his thoughts froze . The shrunken afternoon was already into dusk on this Saturdayin a below-zero January . Dubin was fifty-eight . That was not Oscar ahead , no wooden flute he held in his hand . It was a man with a doublebarreledshotgun resting on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a plaid hunter 's cap , heavy sweater , sealskin Eskimo boots . Dubin lingered to see what he shot at from the road but the hunter , from time to time stopping to survey the field , shot at nothing . The biographer made up his mind to pass quickly and the hunter let him hurry by . A minute later he called his name : " Mr. Dubin ? " It was Roger Foster . They walked together , Dubin at a loss for something to say . Roger embarrassedhim . " What 's the gun for ? " he finally asked . " I thought the hunting season was over ? " " Not much really , Mr. Dubin , " Roger said . " I thought I 'd like to take a potshot at a rabbit or two but have n't laid eyes on one . You can hardly see them this time of the year but sometimes you can spot a cottontail against a tree or rock . No harm done because I generally miss when I shoot . My heart 's not in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I felt sort of down . Thought I 'd stir up a little excitement for myself but have n't so far . " Dubin grunted . Neither spoke as they walked on , then Roger said in a tone of regret , " I do n't guess you like me all that well , Mr. Dubin . I really do n't know why . I grant you 're a good biographer , but so far as understanding live people , I honestly do n't think you know the kind of man I am . " Dubin nodded . Who knows the passing stranger , or the stranger you pass , he thought , even if your wife in a desperate moment aberrantly falls for him . " I 'll bet you still think of me as a sort of stud because I had that reputation in my early twenties , though I am honestly not that way now . Give me credit for growing up  --  people do . " " Roger , " Dubin said , " I admit I do n't know you very well although everyp258so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to be in it , but now and then you suddenly are  --  as though you 'd stepped out of the pages of Dostoyevsky and begun tracking me . I 've come across this fateful phenomenon more often than one would think in biographies I 've read or written . Somebody looks around and there 's this guy tailing him , for good or ill . I suppose it 's different when it 's a woman  --  it 's as if you 'd been expecting her . Anyway , when you least anticipate or want it , a stranger appears , generally an unlikely person , who for one or another reason attempts to define himself to you , and against every expectation , not to mention your resistance , insists on assuming a role in your life . I have no idea what yours is in mine , but I do n't want you to feel I am antagonistic to you in principle or that I am angry about something I am not at all angry about . The older I get , the less I hold people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that matter , against myself . " " To tell the honest truth , " Roger said , " I made no reference to anybody but myself , but since you might be thinking about the time Mrs. Dubin , who I happen to greatly respect , was working in the library , all I want to say is that if there 's anybody I was interested in , and still am , it 's Fanny Bick . " Dubin blew on his icy gloved hands , his breath pure white . How much does he know ? He thought : I will tell him nothing . " The fact of it is , Mr. Dubin , I happen to love Fanny and hope to marry her someday . " " Ah ? " said Dubin . " And does she hope to marry you ? " Roger laughed throatily , wryly , his moody eyes drawn to the white field . " I 've asked her at least four times , including when she was visiting here in December , but she told me she was interested in somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , the message I got was whoever he was is you . " Dubin did not for a minute speak . " What makes you think so ? " " I know Fanny admires your biographies and yourself . Also I sort of know that you helped her put herself together after she had a shaky time in Europe last year . She has a different emphasis than since I first met her . She 's a lot more serious about herself in a way she did n't use to be . I also know you have this mutual friendship that means a lot to her . " " Did she tell you that ? " " Not in so many black-and-white words but it 's what I guess . At first I thought it might be something sort of non-sexual , only now I do n't think thatp259any more , if you do n't mind me saying so , Mr. Dubin . I do n't think of you as that kind of a person . " " What kind of person am I ? " " I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Roger ? " They had stopped walking . Each peered into the other 's face . " I admit you 've been helpful in advising Fanny , but otherwise the fact is you 're married , Mr. Dubin , with two grownup kids and a wife who happens to need you , " Roger said , looking down at Dubin 's galoshes . " What 's more , you 're a good thirty or more years older than Fanny . When we first met she liked me an awful lot , and I honestly and sincerely think she still has a real affection left that might get to be permanent under different circumstances . I figure if you were n't around I might stand a good chance to marry her , although I also admit she has this affinity for older men . Mr. Dubin , I 'm speaking to you as if I were your own son  --  I 'm not proud . I thought I would respectfully tell you how I feel about her , hoping you might make some decision that would give me a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . " " To marry her ? " " To marry her if I could  --  if she wants to get married . Not everybody does nowadays , though I and both my sisters honestly do . What I 'm trying to say to you is I love Fanny very much . " His voice shook . " So do I. " Roger , to Dubin 's embarrassed surprise , sank down on one knee in an awkward gesture of supplication , or despair . In his left hand he still held his shotgun . Dubin walked on , then broke into a trot . He had n't seen Fanny in weeks , felt inertia , lassitude , stasis , wanted not to see her . Was he therefore feeling less for the girl ? Less what ? He had got used to her , knew her too well ? Some of the excitement , the surprise , was gone ? Only her presence , in truth , surprised and she was not present . Though Kitty and he had resolved his temporary mishap and were again comfortable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sexual life . She had postponed going away because of him . She did n't seem to understand how much he wanted to be alone , left alone ; he wanted to be , at least for now , without challenge to emotion , attention , thought ; if possible , also , withoutp260desire . Who needs that forever goad ? Fanny seriously complicated his life . Having one major problem was enough for him  --  the Lawrence biography . That continued to go well : at times it carried Dubin aloft as if he were in a balloon with a spy glass surveying the floating earth . It was the " complication "  --  thetask he wanted most to be concerned with . Gerry and Maud were an ongoing other ; he was used to their problems , and to Kitty 's tangled skein . But Fanny was a complication coming on too fast and strong . She was , in his life , unique ; still he did n't want her pressing him to go abroad with her , urging him to move to New York ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implying divorce . It was all right for Kitty to bring up divorce but not Fanny . Was what he felt for Fanny love ? It was n't the way he had felt toward women in his youth . Do men of more than fifty love less keenly than young men ? He thought the opposite was true : the years deepened the need , the force , the channel of love . At fifty there had to be more at stake : love as a breakwater against age , loss of vital energy , the approach of death . Dubin enjoyed the girl 's feeling for him but how much was he offering in return ? Obviously not too much at the moment although they shared a real enough friendship . He sometimes felt as if he was waiting for her to say it did n't seem to be working and why did n't they simply call it quits ? There were moments when he thought breaking it up now might be a relief  --  a lot less to worry about ; he 'd be freer to concentrate on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision  --  more Fanny , less Kitty ; or vice versa ; or simply no Fanny at all ? There was a real problem , did he have a real choice ? She had n't telephoned lately , nor he her . He thought she might still be annoyed by the barn incident with Kitty though her two or three short letters had n't mentioned it . He had more than once expressed regret . Her letters outlined what she was doing , reading , experiencing ; they made no request nor persuasion . She was , she said , " tired , " but not of what . What good am I for her ? the biographer asked himself . Her letters were contained , muted , saying nothing very personal . She did not say , lately , that she loved him . He wrote innocuous replies . Let 's be friends , Dubin thought , and from time to time , lovers . That would diminish complication and make life easier to manage . He never broached this to her . Lawrence had distastefully spoken of " merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubin was glad he had made no seriousnegative statement to Fanny . Winter broke , retreated , cold waningp261although greedily lingering ; spring was immanent  --  tied hand and foot but softly exhaling its herbal breath ; mysteriously freed , spying outstalking  --  the land as well as memory . Spring lights spring within . My spring gives birth to yours  --  to you . The girl blossomed , bloomed , in his thoughts . Dear God , what have I done ? Why have I allowed myself to doubt my true feeling for her ? He missed her company , easy laughter , warmth , intimate voice  --  whatever it said was intimate  --  her touch , vibrance , their acceptance and enjoyment of each other . He missed her desire , giving , the flower of their embrace in bed . He thought of her , trying not to , between stitches of biographical sentences ; on his long and short walks ; as he lay in bed with his wife . He thought of their best times , joyfully together . He wanted , he spoke it aloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not visit her in the city ; she did not come to him , one way or another , in Center Campobello . As the season advanced Dubin grew restless , irritable ; life was unchanged , confined , reduced . He tried unsuccessfully to hide his mood from Kitty . " You are n't with me , " she chided him ; " you are elsewhere . Where are you ? " He did n't say ; flipped his fingers as if there was no answer , why ask ? He wanted her to sense his abstinence ; instead she sensed his absence , still said they seemed to be drifting apart . It took two to drift together ; Dubin was in no mood to . They disagreed , argued , sometimes bitterly over trivialities : he had forgotten to remind her , though he had promised he would , when a television program began ; she had sent out special delivery a letter he had wanted certified . He did not listen when she talked , Kitty complained . She could not follow directions , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible listening . " Who the hell are you to give directions ? " Kitty said . She walked out with her fingers in her ears . She accused him of destroying their social life by turning down every invitation ; he accused her of not offering any . She did little entertaining . They went at each other face to face ; but Dubin noticed she no longer threatened divorce , as if she had sensed it was now , for him , a viable option . His sleep became surface-thin ; he dreamed endlessly : how can one swim in shallow water ? One night Kitty woke him out of a dream of Fanny to say she smelled something . Was it a fire ? Gas escaping ? Had she left a burner on ? Half asleep , he sniffed the air and smelled nothing . " Are you sure , William ? "  | " What can I be sure of ? " Barefoot , he plodded dully through the house but could smell no smoke nor locate any . Dubin , muttering , sniffed at the burners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable hour engaged in idiotic sniffing . A mad woman makes a man mad . Kitty was standing at the bedroom window in her nightgown , inhaling the night air . It had rained . " It was the wet earth I must have smelled  --  it 's so refreshing . Forgive me , it waked me out of sound sleep . How fresh , how fragrant the earth is . " He got into bed , chilled . Fanny did not reappear in his dreams . In the morning they quarreled over what he called her punitive sense of smell . Kitty said she thought a vacation from each other would do them both good . She 'd been thinking of Stockholm again , wanted to see Gerald . Maud was writing more often lately , but from Gerald , during the winter months , had come wintry silence . She was worried . Later , her eyes uncertain , downcast , Kitty asked Dubin , " Would you care to come with me ? " He had expected it . " What 's the good of it if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " He had had , that morning , a loving note from Fanny : " Lover , father , friend  --  love me , I love you . " The self-conceived defensive ice had broken ; the river of feeling flowed . " I 'll go alone , " Kitty said . He approved , shame contained . She had rarely , since she 'd married him , traveled by herself . It would do her good . What if she were widowed again and had to travel alone ? He knew she 'd go  --  felt admiration for her , affection . On Friday of that week  --  the first in April  --  Kitty packed a suitcase and flew to Stockholm . There were green shoots in her garden , shades of yellow and green , flowers to follow . He waited a day , called Fanny at 8 a.m. , on Saturday . She was at once alert , had been expecting a call . Dubin told her Kitty had gone to Stockholm . " Your note meant a great deal to me . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after twelve , expansive , happy , vital . Every time he saw her , especially after weeks gone by , she seemed more womanly . She stepped out of her Volvo , carrying a tote bag , her purse slung over her shoulder . Fanny entered the house unself-consciously . " I know this place likep263the palm of my hand . " It excited Dubin to have her with him where he had first desired her . He said they would sleep in the guest room on the third floor . " Should we go up now ? " " We 've got two days together , Fanny . Let 's eat first . " " It 's just that we have n't seen each other so long . " He put his arm around her . She nuzzled close , reminded him this was their first spring together . " And not our last . " He had prepared lunch  --  asparagus , a salmon salad , white wine . They ate at the dining table , knees touching . Afterward she rinsed the dishes as Dubin stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , domain . Having her in the house was part of the adventure . " Do n't sweat it , William , " she said , sensing something . " I 've handled nearly everything in this kitchen and will put everything back in place . " He trusted her instincts . They went outside . The silver maples were still leafless and the grass had n't come to green life but the blue-skyed day embraced the earth . They went through the field into the warm wood . Dubin pulled down branches of opening tree buds . They found white hepatica in bloom and full-grown purple and gold crocus and one paper-thin narcissus amid last year 's dead leaves . He thought of the wild flowers they had lain in . " Come on , " Fanny said , taking his hand . They left the woods and she began to run ahead of him on the path . Dubin trotted amiably after her . In the house she ran up the stairs . He followed , thinking she was heading for the third floor . Instead she darted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not in that bed , please , Fanny . " " Why not ? " she laughed , her face flushed , eyes very green . " Kitty would n't like it . Come upstairs . " " I want to sleep with you in your bed . You sleep with me in mine . " She tugged down the bedspread . Dubin grabbed and held her . Fanny , twisting in his arms , pulled down the zipper of his fly . He drew off her shirt . She had nothing on under her jeans . Dubin undressed . Fanny , naked , flipped down the blankets on the double bed . " I said no . " He pulled her to him , holding her tightly . She struggled forcefully but he maneuvered her away from the bed . Fanny tried to shake him off . She was strong , sweated . Dubin , enjoying the struggle , forced her to the floor , lowering himself on her on the rug . Fanny squirmed , rocking from side to side , trying to fend him off with her knees. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dubin froze . Her body smoldered under his . Neither of them moved . As he was getting up , Fanny , grasping his shoulders , pulled him down . They kissed to their teeth . She bit his lip , drawing blood , then as he cried out , yielded  --  he felt her thighs grow soft , part . Dubin went in hard ; she received him gently . Afterward when she asked if she could lie  --  simply lie  --  in the bed he permitted it . He slid under the blanket with her , lying on Kitty 's side as Fanny lay in his place . They lay together , palms touching . Dubin felt a great gratitude to her  --  to life for all it offered . He tried to think of a gift for Fanny , something durable , valuable , beautiful . He wished he had a ring to give her . Perhaps he would have something made . Fanny slept heavily ; Dubin slept with her . In his dream a storm woke them . They woke in a thunderstorm . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bathing the black sky in forked flickering light . Thunder rumbled , ripped through the cloud mass , crashed over their heads . Fanny clung to him . " Are you afraid ? " " I would be if I were alone . " The white curtains were blowing , whipping in the wind . " Jesus , the windows ! " Dubin hopped out of bed . He ran to Maud 's room to close hers and was about to race upstairs but remembered those were shut . Naked , he hurried down to the living room to close the open window there . Dubin wiped the sill and wet floor with a kitchen towel as thunder roared overhead . Excited by the storm , the biographer watched through the window as lightning flared in a circle . He saw himself pursuing the storm to catch it in a basket . Rain hissed in the fireplace . He shut the vent and ran up the stairs . Fanny was not in the double bed . " Are you in the bathroom ? " She was not . A crackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash but heard it rumbling in the distance . " Fanny , where are you ? " No answer . He pulled open the door of Kitty 's dress closet and found the girl , in his wife 's African robe , crouched against the wall . Dubin offered his hand but Fanny refused it and rose awkwardly , her complexion pale . " Please do n't ask me any questions . "  | " I wo n't except are you all right ? " " It 's a question . " " Come to bed . " Fanny stepped out of Kitty 's robe and slipped under the bedcovers . She was shivering . Dubin held her . As her body grew warm a calm settled in him . It rained steadily , heavily , still poured . He listened to the water gushing from gutter spouts . Soon it rained lightly and as the storm departed he listened to it lessening ; then to the raindrops dripping from the eaves of the roof and to the plop-plop of drops from the chestnut tree in front of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want you to know I do n't hide in a closet every time there 's a storm . " " Why did you now ? " " I do n't know . Let 's do n't talk about it . " Her hand caressed his thigh . " I 'm in the mood , are you ? " " I could be but upstairs  --  not in this bed . " " You can have the sheets laundered . Also the rug cleaned where we fucked on the floor , and her bathrobe dry-cleaned . " " Do n't be angry , Fanny . I never mentioned the robe . " " Scared as I was , I could see you did n't want me to wear it . " " Kitty 's senses are sharp . She might know if someone had worn it . " " I never heard of anyone who goes around smelling everything . " " You have your thing , she has hers . " Fanny , after a moment , in a quieter voice spoke of Athens . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , William ? I have another week of vacation coming to me . They might give it to me in May . " " Do n't push it . I 'll go if I can  --  it 's on my mind . " Fanny sat up in the dark . " I really ca n't understand where we stand , " she said angrily . " We have been through a lot together  --  some of it was n't so good but a lot has been fun for both of us . We 're happy when we are together , natural , relaxed  --  we really are . And we get along swell in bed  --  we enjoy each other in good ways . Sometimes the sex is fantastic . Then why do you let so long go by before we meet again , William ? There are times I think all you want is a lay every couple of months or so , just to change the scenery . Dubin denied it . " Do n't you love me ? " she asked  |p266He  said he must . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . " " Then how can we go on like this ? I had to hide from her in the goddamn barn , and now I ca n't even love you in your bed . Why are you so tight-asked ? " Dubin did n't say . " When do you think you will leave her ? " He said , after a moment , that he had no plans to . " What plans do you have ? " " Mostly to get on with my Lawrence . " " You expect us to go on as we have been  --  as we are right now ? " " If possible . I confess I worry about you . I have more than once asked myself whether I ought to let you go  --  for your sake . " " What do you answer yourself ? " " I honestly do n't want to . " " Are you afraid to leave her ? " " It 's not fear I feel . " " Then why do you stay with her ? " " There are commitments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't think you reconsider anything , " Fanny said . " You may want tobut you do n't . You keep what you have and use anything else you can get . " Dubin said he was not only for himself . " My dear Fanny  --  " The telephone rang shrilly . He grabbed for it in the dark . " Hello , dear  --  " Kitty was on the phone , her voice affectionate . Though he had been expecting her call Dubin was displeased to have it come as he was lying in bed with Fanny . His wife sounded distraught . " Gerald has disappeared . I spoke to everybodyI could locate who might know him , but nobody would say where he is now . I ca n't tell you what yesterday was like . Finally I met a young Swedish couple who said he had joined the Communist Party and gone into the Soviet Union . I 'm told other deserters have . I feel desolate . " She wept on the phone . His teeth were on edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's been raining since I got off the plane . I 've had almost no sleep . The hotel room is drafty . The Old City is beautiful and I was hoping to see it in the sun with Gerald , but he 's not here . " " Why do n't you see some of it yourself , anyway , by bus or launch ? See some/thing , for Christ 's sake . Gerry may show up if you stay around a few days . " " I 'm going to the American Embassy Monday morning to talk with them about how to get in touch with him , although I imagine they are n't much interested in deserters . I wish you had come with me . " Dubin said he had n't been able to . " What 's the matter with your voice ?  --  You sound as though you 'd got a cold . " " I have n't . " Fanny coughed ; Dubin cleared his throat . Kitty worriedly asked , " Should I go to Moscow ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me ? Shall I wait for you here ? " He advised her not to rush it . " We 'd better go to Washington first . After we talk to a lawyer we may want to see someone in the State Department . Find out all you can about Gerry , then come home . Could he be in another city ? He told me he liked Uppsala . " " Nobody I talked to seems to think he 's in Sweden . " Dubin doubted anyone knew with certainty . " He may write soon . He could be with the Eskimos in Lapland . Better come home . " She said she 'd fly home Tuesday , and Dubin said he 'd pick her up at the airport . " Goodbye . " He turned on the light . Fanny had got out of bed  --  he thought to go to the bathroom but she had pulled on her underpants and was buttoning a blouse . " Good God , Fanny , what are you getting dressed for ? We 've got the whole night before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , William , I 've told you how good I think we are together and I mean more than in bed . I want you in me but I also want you by me . I feel happy when we 're with each other , sometimes like we were blessed . I know I am good for you but not on the run . " Dubin said he was sorry Kitty had happened to call just then . " I 'm worried about Gerry but that does n't mean we ca n't go on with our plans to enjoy ourselves alone here . She wo n't be back till Tuesday . We 've got two and a half days to ourselves . " " I 've been thinking about us and still ca n't explain what 's happening , " Fanny said . " One thing I do know is I 'm not someone who 's around just to keep your mind off old age . I have got to be more to you than a substitutep268for your lost youth , whatever the hell that is . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have lost some part of their youth . I know I have , and maybe that 's what it 's for . Maybe if you lose it you make up by learning something you have to know  --  the way I imagine you have , and the way I 'd like to . But I have to be myself , Fanny Bick , a woman living with or married to a man who wants her  --  wants to live with her and enjoy their life . I am sick of hiding myself , of not being who I am . It drives me up a wall . I am entitled to an open ordinary and satisfying life of my own . " She stepped into her sandals . Dubin urged her to stay . The storm had swept the clouds away . A wet sunset hung in the trees . " Tomorrow will be a lovely day . We 'll walk in the woods ; we 'll do anything we please and we can talk out our problems and see what they add up to . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on adding up to if you do n't make a decision . Besides , you will be edgy about where Gerald is and that 's not what I want to deal with when I spend a weekend with you . Not this weekend if I can help it . " She had collected her underclothes , diaphragm box , toilet things , and dropped them into her tote bag . Dubin , barefoot , in striped pajamas , followed her downstairs . " At least stay till Sunday . Let 's have breakfast together . Fanny , it 's obscene for you to be going off like this . We mean more to each other than that . " " I do n't want to be in this house any longer , " Fanny said . " I feel your wife 's presence all over the place . I really do n't like her . I do n't think you do either . " " How would you know ? " " I know what I feel in my gut . " He grabbed her arms . " Fanny , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That has to mean something , no matter how our friendship is limited . We have to yield to circumstance for the time being . " " I ca n't any more . " " I beg you  --  " " I ca n't , " Fanny said gloomily . " When will you be in touch with me ? " Dubin asked as she slipped into a raincoat . " When shall I come to the city ? " She did n't want to think about that now . " You 're making a mistake , " he told her.  |p269She  studied him solemnly without replying . He put on the driveway light and watched her back her car out and turn on the road , eyes fixed before her . She had barely returned his wave . Dubin watched till Fanny had gone . " Maybe I 've done her a favor to let her go . " He listened to himself talking to himself . He heard himself groan.  |p270Dubin  and his daughter walk the wet strand of dark shore . A fast step or two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mewling of invisible gulls . A droning wind blowing from the dunes of this sliver of San Francisco beach had driven them from the cold sand where they had tried to picnic , then from the rocks . They shared a sandwich and gulp of tepid coffee and wandered along the gray shore . Long white-capped waves , flowing from the mist-hidden swelling sea , broke in froth at their feet . Hers were wet , slender , rosy ; his corded , purple-veined , sticky with sand . Dubin , in green sweater and dark trousers rolled to his knobby knees , trailed Maud in the thinning rising fog . Years ago , in Cuernavaca , he and Kitty had got her the off-white peasant dress she was wearing ; it looked like a wedding dress but she did not look like a bride . In the wind it clung to her back and wet legs . Her shoulders were thin , hair brownish-red . She had snipped off most of the edge of streaky black . Maud as they walked seemed , in Dubin 's eyes , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom ; she was twenty and seemed thirty . Kitty , after rereading her last letter , had announced the end of an affair . Dubin had said he must go see her . " Yes , do , " Kitty said . " I ca n't , I 've had one very long trip this spring . " On the beach they walk apart.  |p271He  asked her to tell him what had happened . Maud spoke a Chinese poem : " I am not disheartened in the mindless void . / Wheresoever I go I leave no footprint. / For I am not within color or sound . " " I asked a simple question . " " My response is not hard to understand . " " Are you into Zen ? " her father asked . " If Zen will have me " .. . After Fanny had left he waked , that Sunday morning without her , to a cardinal 's shrill whistling . Dubin at length got out of bed , drew up a shade , and peered into the trees . The red bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped rattling away  --  he often ticked when Dubin typed  --  the biographer listened to another birdsong : wood thrush warbling a fluting melody . Does the bird hear music or does it hear noise ? Will I ever hear a nightingale ? He went back to bed and tried to sleep , remembered it had felt late , and at once rose . The clock said past noon . He had n't slept so long in years . Had it coming to him . He had liked that day alone : the company of Wm . Dubin , who 'd been with him all his life  --  nobody 's father , husband , or lover . He was a man in a house getting himself breakfast ; enjoyed scrambling an egg . He thought he 'd skip the Sunday paper  --  too heavy , too long  --  and drew out of the bookshelf Far from the Madding Crowd , had liked it when he was seventeen . Though Lawrence had called Thomas Hardy " a bad artist , " Dubin tended to favor his work and the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had his Frieda ; he bedded her and yawped . His passionate love for a woman had sprung his ideology of wise blood , as though passionate love could be thus contained , reduced . Hardy , although strongly moved by a variety of women , had flitted from one to another , not daring much . For years he 'd been sexually attracted  --  one after another  --  to three female cousins , " lower-class " women , none of whom he had appeared to have had an affair with . Then he contracted an essentially loveless marriage to a tough overweight childlike woman , who ultimately freed him from their prison by dying . Hardy was of course of his late-Victorian time ; but time or none , he was not as frank or honest about himself as the miner 's son . Hiding his knocked-up cook of a mother , and his unaccomplished simple relatives , Thomas Hardy fabricated a " biography " " by " his second wife and formerp272secretary , Florence . " If I get you here , " he wrote her after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tight . " The book for years had misled its readers about his nature and experience . Lawrence , though he admired Hardy 's sensibility , and his " instinct , " could not stand the way the sexually repressed characters in his novels maimed and ultimately destroyed themselves ; failed " life 's plenitude " by succumbing to the stupid blind power of the community . Yet Dubin , sympathetic to the older writer , considered he might somedaywrite a biography of Thomas Hardy . He wondered why he was n't doing it now instead of the one of Lawrence . Hardy and Dubin both had blue-gray eyes . Flora had called . She had seen Kitty at the airport the day she delivered Oscar to a flight for a concert in Salt Lake City . " If you 're free , come over . " Dubin , after a moment , doubted he could make it . " Have you given me up , William ? " " I find it hard to poach in Oscar 's domain . " " I am my own domain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a change . Lying , afterward , in his bed , he fell asleep . When he awoke it was night , a crescent moon in the lit sky . He lay in bed wondering if he was lonely . He ate supper out of a sardine tin with a squeeze of lemon and a sliced tomato . After rinsing spoons , forks , and cup he put in a long-distance call to Maud . The girl who answered said she was in San Francisco . He sat down and wrote her a letter ; he owed her several . And he was glad Kitty was getting back Tuesday . He worried on and off about Gerald ; but in bed at midnight , when he thought back on the day , it had n't been a bad Sunday . After a good morning of work Dubin had driven into town for a paper , conscious that he had dreamed heavily during the night , though he could remember nothing of his dreams . He tucked the newspaper under his arm and experienced something stronger than an impulse to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand in his head was waving him back . Dubin hurried on , possibly to see what he had n't come here yesterday for fear of seeing . " What 's fate for ? " He had thought while shaving : if she went to Roger 's house after leaving me she 'd be gone now  --  has to be at work today . If for some reason she 's still with him , I do n't want to know . Yet here 's Dubin spying her out ; and as he had imagined he might , without surprise , came upon Fanny 's white Volvo parked in the street inp273front of Roger 's house . His reaction was quickly to flee ; instead he circled her car to be certain it was Fanny 's ; and on the back seat spied a yellow apple and her sandals . It was as though the apple bled . Wait up , Dubin , a hoarse voice advised , but his thoughts raced on . He pictured clearly and in living color a scene from the past : Here 's Dubin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good a year and a half ago . When the performance was over he was convinced he had made a mistake in letting the girl go . How could he , in his right mind , have done it ? He ought by some means or other to have persuaded her to stay . His legs wobbled . Dubin had considered going for a drive to mull over what to do but could n't bear to leave the spot without having talked to Fanny . He felt he had misplaced something , an arm or leg . Let me be sane , the biographer thought : nothing very serious has happened . There 's been no irrevocable break  --  of course we 'll meet again . We are important to each other . Why should I think she 's slept with Roger because she may have stayed the night in his house ?  --  perhaps slept in a room there as she 'd done when she first came to this town . Even two nights . How unkind I am to her . Suppose she did sleep with him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how I mishandled her ? Besides , they 're friends : the guy loves her , wants to marry her , and Fanny 's warmhearted response to feeling is one of her talents . I must n't think of it as another betrayal . If anybody 's to blame it 's me . He 'd gone home thinking he 'd telephone Fanny and ask to see her . The phone rang for a full five minutes . He then called the library , asked for Roger , and when the librarian said hello , Dubin remained silent . Roger hung up . Still , he was at work , not in bed with her . Dubin then picked up his Hardy novel but reading it felt unreal . Boldwood 's morbid jealousy of Bathsheba embarrassed him . He drove again to Roger 's house , went up the porch steps , rang the bell . No one came to the door . As he was driving home Dubin turned in mid-block and rode back to town . It was now almost five o'clock . He waited fifteen minutes under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Roger came out and locked the door Dubin trailed him from a block behind , then lingered in his parked car , hoping Fanny would come out of the house  --  if she ever did  --  and drive off to New York City . He 'd follow and signal her in her mirror to pull over so they could talk . An hour later , Fanny , in skirt and red blouse , left the house with Roger . She was not carrying her worldly goods , not even the shoulder bag . Roger double-locked the front door as she waited on the porch  --  they looked likep274a young couple on their way to dinner out . They went down the steps , Roger 's face lit by a happy smile , Fanny talking animatedly  --  no mourner she  --  and got into his Chevy . Was her car out of commission ? Was that why she had stopped off momentarily , and then it grew to a visit ? Dubin swiped at this straw  --  wanted it to be so ; but her car was in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They drove away  --  where Dubin could not know unless he took off after them . The thought was degrading though he favored the action . Where would it get him ? He did not follow them . Instead he drove home ; he 'd considered Flora 's but quashed that . He felt like a man trying to keep something evil , indecent , from breaking out . This will pass , he promised himself . Do n't go on reacting like a child to a threatened loss of affection . I 've had my morbid little experiences  --  nomore of that . If I have to give Fanny up I will . This is as good a time as any  --  better , in fact : I 'm into the act . But when he thought of her bestowing on Roger that warm affection she had so often expressed for him , those intimate pleasures she had shared with William Dubin , the floor under him seemed to sag . A spurt of jealousy spread like acid in the blood . He resisted the feeling , as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My God , why is this happening to me ? Why should it be ? In the shower he thought : she 's had Roger before and nothing came of it . He ca n't give her better than I gave  --  give . She 's bound to come back if I 'm patient . Just do n't do the wrong thing . The wrong thing is to suffer needlessly . So Dubin informed himself , but his thoughts did not appease or console him . He was heavy with desire of her , his penis as if salted , swollen . " Control yourself , " he warned himself , and did n't like the sound of it . Could Fanny have planned this : had guessed he would check her out at Roger 's  --  had foreseen his reaction , possibly to force him to define his commitment to her ; decided once and for all how genuine , compelling , it was ? That was n't much Fanny 's way , yet who knew for sure ? Whatever her way was he had to have her back  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a sane decision . Reason 's the word : see the situation as is  --  no one had said goodbye forever , so why jump the gun ? Of course Fanny would call him  --  a question of time . This self-created crisis  --  his sense , surely illusory , of their affair having ended badly , had hit him in the head upon discovering her car at Roger 's curb . He had once more to contend with the shame ofp275supposed betrayal : Fanny reacts to frustration by sleeping with the nearestguy in sight  --  had the bitch learned nothing ? No , Dubin thought , this is something else again , in truth more serious . Roger is not the gondolier ; he wants to marry her , an altogether ultimately more perilous situationfor me . This fear tips Dubin 's unsettled self and jealous bubbles bubble forth . My God , what else am I capable of that I did n't know ? How many more hollows will I uncover in myself ? How can this sort of thing , not at all admirable in youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned himself : It 's one thing for a man not to know , not to have learned ; it 's another not to be able to live by what one does know . That 's sure danger . The next day Fanny 's car had disappeared . Dubin had discovered this on his way to the airport to pick up his wife . He 'd felt a short-lived relief , until he learned in a long-distance call he made later that Fanny was n't at work ; was not expected in until Wednesday morning . Roger , he then learned , was n't at the library . Where in hell were they ? Kitty 's plane was delayed several hours . Dubin had to return for her that evening . Subdued , worn dark with fatigue , she embraced her husband . On entering the house Kitty cautiously sniffed the burners , interestingreversal . After he had poured her a cup of tea she talked at length of her search for Gerald , ending with her litany of regrets . He observed her carefully , after a while excusing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs , leaving Lorenzo to comfort Kitty . No one answeredat the girl 's apartment . He wondered where she was and what they were doing . The original misery played its dirty little tune . That night he persuaded Kitty , despite her fatigue , to make love , exchanging an overwhelming desire for momentary release  --  the small brain of the shmuck was without conscience . But the act eased the acid-eating self : Fanny , wherever she was , Kitty 's grace kept at bay . Let her go , he told himself as his wife slept . It was n't meant to be more than an affair , a short adventure and quits . I 've had a good time with her . She is n't the kind of woman I would have thought to marry , although people do change : we are n't who we were ; she is matured , shows more control , wants better for herself than she 's had . And we 've seriously affected one another . Obviously she means more to me than I 'd supposed . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . She lives in my blood and neither will nor reason can wring her out . Myself , my self 's heart , aches for her , forp276a glowing fundamental pleasure that comes with and from her , an easeful enjoyment of life . That night the biographer loved and violated her in sensual and perverse ways . He tore at her every sexual stirring , gratified every fantasy . In steaming dreams and torpid reverie he sought satisfaction on her now familiar , though always surprising , pleasure-yielding body . When at last he fell into a grating half sleep he spoke her name aloud . Kitty abruptly awoke . " Fanny who ? " " Fanny , " Dubin confessed , " must be the girl who worked for us summer before last . " " Why are you dreaming of her now ? " " What shall I tell my dreams to dream ? " Kitty yawned . " She must have caught your fancy . " She got up to go to the bathroom . Dubin waited for her to come out and then went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the morning a letter had come from Fanny : " Once you said be kind to yourself . I am trying to be . That 's why I think we ought to stay broken off . For about a week I did n't think we really were but now I do think so . You would n't have let me split that night if in your heart you were n't glad I was going . Maybe you did n't actually want it to happen but you took the out I gave you . I gave it to you to be kind to myself . I was tired of the punishment I was taking . I want someone who wants me . I do n't care if we get married or do n't but I wo n't live alone , it hurts too much . I ca n't see any future for us the way things have been going  --  sometimes I think you 're blind , William  --  so we 'd better not see each other any more . I appreciatecertain things you have done for me  --  some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand you take away what the other gives . I hope you know what I have done for you . Sincerely , Fanny . " Dubin wrote an impassioned plea : " Dearest Fanny , Let 's not make a hasty mistake . Let 's not end what may have barely begun . " Such was the biographer 's commitment . He had mailed his letter and also called her from the barn but now her home telephone was disconnected ; and at work they said Fanny had quit . " If she really has n't , kindly tell her it 's William Dubin on the phone , with much good will and an expectation of kindness . " " Why would I want to lie to you ? " the operator asked . " I 've often been in love myself . "  |p277Dubin  had then telephoned Roger Foster , with a wretched stirring of jealousy , to ask if he knew where Fanny could be found ; and Roger said , without sorrow or laughter , he thought she 'd gone back to Los Angeles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I actually do n't , Mr. Dubin . Not that I did n't ask her , but Fanny was n't all that certain where she was heading . Maybe L.A. , or to San Francisco , and she said she 'd send me a postcard once she knew for sure . " " Would you kindly let me know where she is when you get that card ? " " I will if she does n't object . " Dubin had felt an irrational impulse to tell him to stay the hell away from Fanny but had no right to say it . A few days later he had made up his mind to go to New York to see if he could find her . Kitty , alternating worry about Gerald with a nagging concern for Maud , who seemed to have stopped writing or calling , said she was in no mood to be left alone in the house . " The house wo n't hurt you , " Dubin said . He had thought of telling her he was intending to get legal advice about Gerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him why he was going to the city . Kitty had n't offered to drive him to the station , so Dubin drove himself . He parked at the depot and boarded the train before realizing he had left her without a car . In the city he went at once to Fanny 's apartment . The door stood open . The flat was empty  --  the floor covered with paint-spattered drop cloths . The landlord and a painter standing on a ladder were talking inside . " Excuse me , " said Dubin , " do you happen to know where the young lady who lived here has moved to ? " " Who knows , " said the landlord , " where they go . " " Where they want , " said the painter , " they go . These are different times . " Dubin , at the window , gazed down at the synagogue . An old Jew was praying . Where they want they pray . At the Gansevoort he sat at the desk in his room and wrote Fanny a note , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My dearest Fanny , I wish I had done it better . I wish I were a single man  --  or perhaps more daring . I wish ... Life is so varied , sweet , sad . Think of me thinking of you . Surely we 'll see each other again ? My sense of it is that you 're handling your life with purpose . Go on as you are . Ever yours , William Dubin. "  |p278As  he addressed the envelope he was running through his mind the winter without her . The morning in San Francisco he met Maud in the hotel lobby and drove in her VW to the beach . Maud is drawn , distant , lonely . He is tormented to see her so .. . In her last letter she had said she was n't intending to return to college for her senior year . Her father was at first angered , but rereading her several letters of the past year had filled him with regret : she had been signaling something less than the joyful life . He had let her down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover what was eating her . He had asked superficial questions and accepted casual replies . In one letter she had spoken of an interest in Eastern religions , not before a serious concern of hers . With Maud much happened in little time . In another letter she wished she had her life to live over . " Before you 've begun to live ? " No response to speak of . He tried it on the telephone : " Before you 've begun to live ? " " Who 's to say how much anybody else has lived ? " Fair enough , though not enough . Kitty still theorized that Maud was having her ups and downs in love . Dubin hoped it was that simple . So did Kitty . Two weeks ago Maud had telephoned and asked not to be called by them . " Why not ? " Dubin asked . " I need time to think things through . " " We wo n't interfere with your thoughts . " " I 'm asking a favor , " Maud wept . Granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally asking her out for lunch or a drive , or to walk his walk with him , he felt he had given her not much . Yet she was , after all , home : they talked at the table ; had shared the drama of Watergate  --  it was interesting to see Nixon , perennialloser , like a magician fabricating his losses . Maud read , played tennis , backpacked with the couple living on Mt . No Name ; but it was obvious the focus of her life was elsewhere . Dubin and she seemed to resist each other  --  no explanation he could think of except they were interested in others . His thoughts had lain in Fanny 's lap . One would think that if a man loves , the fountain flows : all may drink , no limit . But in truth the feeling of love for those one has loved was not boundless  --  it was bound . One loved according to his capacity but capacities differ . If you loved someone with deepeningp279passion the love of others was effectively reduced , perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundless  --  not more than a pailful  --  barely enough for one at a time . You pour love out for a single self : in theory , no ; but in practice other selves get less . Not that Maud had wanted more from him than he ordinarily gave of affection . She had seemed , last summer , to want less ; but that he had n't offered more in a time of need bothered Dubin . It worried him that he never really had known what was going on with Maud once she was past sixteen , as if this fact , natural enough , embedded in their history , was itself the major cause of what was presently lacking in their relationship . He had thought of telling her about Fanny  --  being honest  --  but had n't because he did n't want her to think of him as her mother 's betrayer . Reasoning it thus was how Dubin balanced the construction in his mind : in loving Fanny he withheld love from his wife and daughter . Fanny had , on her last birthday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face in the crowd awaiting arrivals at the San Francisco Airport . Neither she nor his daughter appeared . On the beach he impulsively drew her to him . Maud , shivering , stooped to pick up a shell . Dubin thrust his hands into his pockets . " I remember , " he said , " when you were a little girl . Once you asked me to marry you . " " Oh , Papa , " she said with an impatient gesture . " Sentimentality has its moments . " " Not just this minute , please . " " Maud , " Dubin said , " Why do n't you tell me what 's going on with you ? Are you in love ? Is it going badly ? " " I 'm always in love . Sooner or later it goes badly . " He did not know what to reply . Maud then said she would n't be going back to college in the fall . " I 've had it with school . I want something else  --  something more satisfying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she were wiping away tears . The wind blew her hair into her face . Heartache , he reflected , became her age , not his .

I 'm tired of intellectual studies , tired of intellectuals . " " Who in particular ? " " No one you know . " **26;6203;TOOLONG to him that he might be experiencing in his own persona thing he had read about with slight disgust in the newspapers : the incredible tendency on the part of hostages  --  bank tellers , air stewardesses , motherly middle-aged passengers  --  to " see the good side " of their kidnappers : " They behaved to us like perfect gentlemen , " " He was as sweet as he could be . " Some carried it to the point of actually falling in love with them ; he remembered the Swedish bank employee who greeted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henk would not say that his own symptoms were in any way amorous . Nor did he think that he was in the process of being converted to a terrorist outlook : observing terror at close quarters , he felt more than ever the futility and waste of it . But , being at close quarters , he could not fail to glimpse their point of view , which caused him to turn about and look at his own party with freshened eyes . Yet he was feeling something else : pity for the hijackers . Their brief life-expectancy moved him as he studied the moony countenance of the machine-gunner , the soft baby-fat cheeks and incipient dewlaps . Within a year , in all likelihood , this boy would be dead ; prison would only be an unwelcome reprieve  --  if held too long , he would hang himself . There were no active middle-aged terrorists or grizzled retired terrorists . He was a warrior , born to a short life , like the sulky Achilles or his friend 's idol Yoshitsune . And , whatever he had been taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ideas to live after him . Today 's arch-revolutionaries had no faith in a future life for their ideas ; it was gone , like the Christian faith in God 's design . If , thanks to this calfish specimen , Henk 's own days or minuteswere now numbered , at least he had had his full share of life 's rewards and amusements . The fact that he had just celebrated , after a fashion , his thirty-eighth birthday ( where , bythe way , was that magazine with the horoscope ? ) suddenly seemed rather indecent , an actuarial disproportion that was like being overweight in a time of world hunger . And the pity he felt for the kapers , even that brute of a woman , was sharp/ened by irritation with the sheer folly of their enterprise . The optimum result they could hope for would be to gain the release of a few fellow-terrorists , to engage in more hijackings , daring raids , and kidnappings  --  a vicious circle , for most would be shot or returned to jail . The ransom money they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicidal operations ; unlike the normal criminal , they knew of no other use for it . A food distribution , were they to include it in their demands , would turn into a grotesque scene from Brueghel . Could reason make them see the vicious circle they were spinning in ? That they were all doomed to violent and pointlessextinction , on the model of their hero , Che ? They would hardly be open to dissuasion at this stage . It would be pointless to make the effort , even if he were summoned again . A plea coming from him addressed to their own self-interest would not be recognized as such , however feelingly it was expressed . But later a time might come . If they got their helicopter and were put down with their freight of captives on the lonely polder , a new chapter could open . Under those circumstances , it might not be impossible , for example , to " reach " the machine-gunner , evidently the most susceptible member of the team . Basho , as had been demonstrated , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tender sentiment surrounding the poet and the Japanese guerrilla might be the point of entry . If the youth was responsive to poetry , in principle he was salvageable , though it was true , Henk sadly recalled , that here in Holland some of the worst SS men had been lovers of Rilke and Holderlin  --  his father , the magistrate , had cited the fact ironically when he had gone to witness against them at their trials . Still , poetry , as a frail trait d'union , the thin edge of the wedge , was a hope  --  the only one available . That Henk had been led by a queer chain of coincidences to recite those lines could be taken for a sign from Heaven , showing him the right way . But the plump gloomy boy , however open to softer influenceshe might prove to be , was subordinate to the others . Even if he could be gently detached from them , at night as he stood watch , how in fact could he help ? He had only the one weapon.  |p152And  should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what it would amount to . Henk shook his head , feeling distaste for the train of thought he had been pursuing . Once again he despaired . Sophie gripped his hand ; he raised his eyes . The woman was standing in the doorway , her pistol peeping from her blouse . She had an announcement to make . A light meal was going to be served . As soon as they had eaten , the prisoners were to gather their hand baggage and proceed to the first-class cabin , where disembarkation would take place . A helicopter was standing by . " And Sapphire ? " asked Victor hoarsely , speaking for the first time today ; there were cake-crumbs in his two-dayoldbeard . " You will leave your cat , " said the woman . " The hostesses will dispose of it . And you will not be needing the carrier . " Before Van Vliet de Jonge left the cabin , he retrieved the copy of Elle . In captivity he would have time , finally , to peruse his birthday horoscope . But in the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowning at the cover , which showed a pretty blonde girl wearing a blue-andwhitecrocheted cap  --  the winter sports number . His eyes slowly rose and met Van Vliet 's with a look of childish mischief  --  was he inviting the deputy to a hand-to-hand struggle for possession of a French cover girl ? Then with a grunt , as if to denote relinquishment , he handed the fashion magazine back . His white teeth flashed in a broadening , still mischievous smile as he helped himself instead to a cigar from the deputy 's pocket.  |p153Human  nature , they decided , was contrary . One would have supposed that they would have been grateful for practically any change , anything to break the monotony  --  more than a day in the jumbo at that point without even a cribbageboard . Yet the first-class hostages had not welcomed the arrival of a slew of hostages from Economy in their midst . Utterly unannounced : up to the minute the curtain had parted and that procession had filed in , one had thought one was alone in one 's glory ; it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the goats had taken place , eons ago , the whole Economy contingent would have been released . So that it had been a shock to see these people appear and to learn that one was going to have them for company on the next leg of the journey , for no sooner had they made their appearancethan the loud-speaker had blared : everyone was to collect his belongings and stand ready to board another aircraft . But then a long wait had followed , and in the interval one had had time to sort out who was who , more or less , among one 's future companions . The gangling , bow-tied minister ( Lily knew him from ages back ) had got himself quite a name for being the worst type of bleeding heart  --  sad for his sweet wife and family and for his church , which was paying the price ; nobody had a pew there any more . The stout tweedy old party with him , who looked quite a dear really with his apple cheeks and his " brolly , " had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same brush : he had been close to Eleanor , it seemed , though Franklin could never abide him . And dear silly Charles , turning up like a bad penny after his " slumming " tour ; one forgave him because one was used to his prattle . He was a nice old thing at heart , would n't hurt a fly . He knew what it was to live with beautiful things . But clinging to him was a little rouged woman with dangling earrings and a screechy voice who could not stop talking  --  some sort of menopausalcause-person probably that he had picked up for his sins on one of his pinko boards . And there was a red-eyed unshaven creature draped in a filthy scarf and with a basket of cat food and " kitty-litter " who was evidently one of the flock ; he had helped himself to several miniatures of vodka from the servingpantryas he went by , and the steward had just shrugged . What the lot of them had been doing on a flight to Teheran was rather hard to imagine ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and archaeology , and neither , one would think , was their dish of tea . But it fitted that that Senator Carey was with them , a maverickeven in his own party . He was a well-groomed man at any rate , rather actorish like so many of his trade but handsome in a theatrical way . He probably used a rinse on that silver hair and dyed his eyebrows . And of course he would be odoriferous of toilet lotion  --  the Irish in him coming out . He was exchangingwitticisms with a younger man , quite handsome too , with a trench coat slung over his shoulders and got up in a flaring whipcord suit coat that must have been " bespoke " ; he wore a folded-over scarf for a tie and did not seem like an American . With them was a tall , frowning girl with a long Jewish nose that Beryl said she knew  --  another lefty , needless to say . Bringingup the rear had been a short bristly man , who looked like a professor , with a pipe . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavatory . Luckily , though , there was room in the helicopter for the two parties to keep their distance . Beryl , right away , had wanted to fraternize , but Lily , exercising a mother 's rights , had made her stay put . Until they had actually laid eyes on the " whirlybird " they were going to have to board  --  quite a feat for a woman of Margaret 's girth  --  they had been fearing a tight squeeze . Some of the ladies had armed themselves with atomizersfrom their toilet cases to ward off odors , and clever Mrs. Chadwick had improvised quite a pretty fan from the Air France menu . But there was space , and to spare , for everybody , including two of the cabin crew . The steward told them that the giant helicopter had been flown in from Germany ( West ) , which was the reason for the long delay , but Harold Chadwick was sure it was an American jobbie  --  they did not make them that size over here . And one certainly need not have worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully drafty . Noisy as well ; you could hardly hear yourself think . Johnnie Ramsbotham , who was up front , had kept shouting at the pilot to ask where they were bound for , but any answers he might have got were lost in the din of the propeller-blades . The stewardess  --  the nice one , with the smelling-salts  --  had no idea where they might be going . Lapland , it felt like , from the interior temperature . The high-colored , strong-jawed fellow in the whipcord seemed to know ; he was standing up , rather dangerously , and pointing out landmarks to the Senator . But it was useless to call out and ask him ; he would not be able to hear . That was the disadvantage of having stayed with one 's own group , leaving a no man 's land of empty seats in between . Johnnie , who was a sailor and knew how to take his bearings , thought they must still be over Holland . But they had not seen any windmills . And not a sign of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the sun was already setting . He flew his own plane , so he understood these things . According to him , the pilot would not dare to put down in the dark , just like that , without ground flares to guide him . They could count on half an hour of light after sunset ; after that , they would have to find a proper landing field or crash . It was unnerving to have to hear that , considering all they had been through already ; it would be the last straw to die at this point in a common ordinary plane crash . So far , except for the little curator , everybody had been amazingly brave ,  |p156treating  it as a lark and fortifying the inner man with drinks ; Helen Potter was quite tiddly . They had agreed to be philosophicalabout their baggage  --  Air France could keep it for them in Amsterdam , hopefully under lock and key  --  you could hardly expect hijackers to be interested in whether you had your nighties or clean shirts . On seeing the new additions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about rations : wherever they were headed for , there would be a great many mouths to feed , and the lefties , they feared , would get the lion 's share . Foresighted Johnnie , before quitting the jumbo , had stuffed his pockets with Air France candies from the tray . Still , it would not hurt most of the males to tighten their belts a bit ; they could make believe they were at one of their " fat farms . " Yet now , with dusk gathering , all the bravely hidden worries peeked out . First , the mystifying fact of having been singled out as " hostage material " ( Beryl 's funny phrase ) when the rest of the first-class passengers had been sent packing . " Do we look so prosperous ? " Johnnie had innocently wondered . Well , obviouslythey did . Johnnie Ramsbotham was one of the two hundred richest men in America . But how could the hijackers know that ? Unless Charles had been naughty . The old tease loved to talk about " my millionaires " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop to think that hijackers too had ears . And next there were the collections , which was the point that they all  --  multi-millionaires or just making ends meet  --  had in common . Could a little bird have told the hijackers about those ? Helen 's Vermeer was famous , and she had been generous  --  or foolish  --  enough to share it with the public by letting it hang on loan in a show for one of her charities . And Harold 's Cezannes were in all the books . Johnnie collected only sporting art , but his Stubbses and Degas were worth fortunes , not to mention his Dufy sailing subjects and his great Ward . As for Lily , some authorities thought her English water-colors , though fewer in number , were every bit as fine as Paul Mellon 's . Then of course there was the " couple " little Mr. Walton , the curator , had included on his own say-so  --  they were of his ilk ,  |p157evidently  . They had joined the tour at the airport , having driven up from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter ; the rest of the time they lived in Duxbury , outside of Boston . No one knew yet what they collected . Prints , one might guess , since , to judge from their battered attache cases sporting ancient hotel stickers , they belonged to the category of " more taste than money . " But prints , these days , were " in " and could fetch enormous prices . Eventually one could ask . Yet even if the hijackers had somehow got wind of this tour of collectors , how could that serve their purposes ? All those treasures were back in America , protected by the latest burglaralarmsystems and fully insured . Nobody traveled with their valuables these days . Years ago , Wintie Thorp , before he became a vegetable , used to take his Byzantine ivories with him on the steamer to Europe and set one up in his hotel dressingroomevery morning on the shaving-stand , so that he could look at it while shaving , start the day right , but there were no old-fashioned steamers any more and no shaving-stands , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection  --  too portable . Today someone feeling the pinch and having been stung once too often at Sotheby Parke Bernet might hand-carry a little pair of icons or a Book of Hours to Christie 's in London for appraisal , but if the insurance company knew about it , the premiums would be prohibitive . Of the present group , only Charles , apparently , could not learn to move with the times ; he insisted on wearing that intaglio ring  --  crystal , with " amor fati " incised in it  --  that he said had belonged to some Lord Acton , and if you turned out his pockets you would be bound to find a few of his " trinkets , " a rare Babylonian shekel or a sweet little Twelfth Dynasty Horus . At least his fabulous porcelains were safe with his couple on Mount Vernon Street . So that the collections should be the least of anybody 's worries now ; there was no earthly reason to fear on their behalf . And yet she did , roared Margaret , and doubtless they all did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , or even itsy-bitsy ones , was that the minute anything out-of-thewayhappened , your thoughts flew to them like a mother birdp158to the nest . Most of the time , unless you were showing the collection to visitors , you hardly saw the master works hanging on your walls or mounted in cases , the way you ceased to hear a clock ticking after awhile  --  it was something about the attention-span . That was why experts advised one to keep changing their positions . If Helen looked at her Vermeer more than once a week , it would be unusual ; her maid , dusting the frame with a special soft brush , spent more time , probably , " communing " with it than she did . It was a privilege to be a domestic in a house like that , where practically every stick of furniture was signed by a great cabinet-maker ; they said beauty was contagious if you were exposed to it long enough , but sometimesone wondered  --  look at Harold . In any case , rub off on you or not , beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who eventually grew up and found their own way . Whenever you went off for a weekend , or even downtown to the hairdresser , a part of you stayed home with your treasures , and your first thought , on opening the door after an absence , was to make sure they were still there . They said you could store them in a vault , like your jewelry , when you went away , but what was the point of having beautiful things if you had to keep coming home to blank spaces on the walls and a constant traffic of bonded moving-men on the carpets ? Then there was the burden of caring for them , seeing that they had the right temperature and humidity , protecting them from the sun , making certain that they were dusted , or not dusted , as the case might be . At least , unlike an animal , they did not have to be exercised . Lily , by the bye , had a funny story about this bolshie minister when he was a curate . She had had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she still had the house on Fifth Avenue  --  and in those days there was a little Augustus John in the morning-room that had come down to her from an aunt . People always asked to see it , because of the subject  --  Churchill'sbeautiful American mother  --  though it was a flashy thing and she finally put it up for auction . Anyway , that day there was a new butler , and when this Reverend Mr. Barber turnedp159up , just out of Divinity School , he asked him " Where is the John ? " In an undertone , because the music had already started . So the butler said " Here , sir , " and showed him to the toilet . The curate was so mortified that he went in and did his businessand turned tail and left . Lily only heard later , from the butler , what had happened . " He asked me for the john , madam , and I directed him . " " I do n't know why Mother insists on telling that story , " loudly complained Beryl , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrels with Lily . For weeks , they gathered , she had been refusing to come on this tour and then , characteristically , changed her mind at the last minute  --  such a bother for Lily , who had to pull strings with the Iranian ambassador in Washington , so that the girl could have her visa in time . He could not have been more charming , and yet Beryl would not even write him a little note of thanks . Now she was tickled that they had been hijacked ; it had " made " her winter , she announced . She would say anything of course to be different , but perhaps in a pitiful way it was true . Her life with Lily in that apartment was rather barren ; she had so few interestsof her own and refused to share in her mother 's : she had hated art from the cradle and had her own queer little collections of inartistic objects , such as antique false teeth and poison labels for medicine bottles  --  quite amusingly arranged , it had to be admitted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had that figure problem , which was not glands but plain over-eating  --  stuffing herself to fill an aching inner void  --  she could have been rather stunning . She had a real porcelain complexion ( proof of perfect elimination , consideringwhat she ate ! ) , which she had to disfigure with big circus patches of rouge . Her hair was thick and naturally blond , and she wore it in a wide Dutch bang that came down to a point in the middle over the family nose  --  a twenties style called the " Sweetheart " that she had found in some cheap magazine . Her best feature was her eyes , bluer than Lily 's and glittering like sapphires , which too often she hid behind huge dark glasses , as though she thought she was Jacqueline Bouvier orp160a film star . And she would not let Lily dress her . Instead , she had a passion for " separates "  --  billowy skirts and assorted brightcoloredblouses that recalled whole choruses of buxom villagers in an opera . Johnnie commented that Beryl 's outfits always looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop and then thrown them all together in a hopper . For the flight she had not wanted to wear her lovely long mink  --  Lily 's Christmas offering . Instead , there was a cherished junk-fur jacket dyed a brilliant blue that she had planned to put on over slacks . Lily had had to insist , and now , in this freezing cabin , Beryl could be grateful . Her trouble , of course , was that she dressed to get attention , from men , obviously ( the idea that women dressed for other women certainly did not apply in her case ) , and she succeeded ; that is , she made herself conspicuous , which was not hard , given her size . She might have taken a leaf from Margaret 's book , but Margaret was all in scale ; her height and deep booming voice carried her weight , and the mannish tailleurs she wore ( always Captain Molyneux ) made her look redoubtable , like a monument , which would stand out naturally in a crowd . You could not call the Statue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have told Beryl , did not care to be seen with conspicuous women , while the other kind , who would have been attracted anyway by her inherited wealth , seemed to find her an embarrassment themselves in the long run . An heiress who looked like something out of the five-and-ten ( there had been Woolworth money , be it said , on Joe 's side ) and would not be caught dead in a smart supper club , only the lowest of low dives , must be a chore to run about with , even in Mother 's chauffeured old Rolls . At any rate her " pashes " were always letting her down , and she cried in her bedroom and had orders sent in from the drugstore , rejecting Lily 's trays . Naturally , as with the clothes she set her heart on , she was fatally drawn to men who were crude and common , men who were bound to hurt her . It would not be beyond Beryl to set her cap at one of the hijackers before this was over . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammedans admired fat women , and that milkwhiteskin and yellow hair had an appeal for the dark-skinned races , as poor Lily had reason to know : a few years ago , there had been a Negro delivery boy who was learning to play the trumpet , but when Beryl had paid for enough lessons he had got a job with a band and skipped out . Even undesirables had their sticking-point  --  surprising but true . And , however one viewed her appearance , Beryl could be impossibly rude and overbearing . Yet she could be a sweet child too . Johnnie , who liked to spar with her , was convinced that she was still a virgin . It was a case , he argued , of arrested adolescence ; one of his wives had been the same  --  you could see it in their chubby upper arms . If she could just cut loose from Lily 's apron-strings , she would mature fast , he thought ; as it was , her mind had developed , but her body had not kept pace with it . As proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cite the fact that she had never played around with drugs ; she was still in the milkshake stage and did not even like alcohol , except gin alexanders and sweet liqueurs . If Beryl 's sitting-room , as Lily maintained , had a permanent sweet reek of marijuana  --  damned hard to get out of the draperies , as Johnnie knew from his own progeny 's " dens "  --  it was only her friends smoking the weed . Milkshakes and crushes and a yen to be different from Mamma , that was all that was the matter with Beryl . She held it against Lily that they were rich ( though Lily only had her widow 's portion ) ; that seemed to be the chief grievance , which Johnnie said he could understand  --  he had faced the problem himself as a young man . She would have to learn to live with it , like everybody else , and stop feeling that it was a " curse " and her mother 's fault . No wonder , though , that she had got a kick out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had repeated , back in the Air France jet , with a triumphant shake of her yellow locks . " C'est bien fait pour nous , " she had proceeded to translate , beaming up at the plump young Arab . " N'est-ce pas , monsieur ? " But the wary youth had had the grace to be evasive . " Sais pas , madame . "  |p162Well  , doubtless it was lucky that someone in the party , for whatever disloyal reason , was enjoying the experience . Beryl 's total fearlessness , you could say , was good for the general morale , which needed some bolstering now that the drinks had worn off . The little curator was shivering in his thin coat ; if it had not been for that constant whirring noise , one could surely have heard his teeth chatter  --  the stewardess ought to have thought to bring some Air France blankets along . And the sun was rapidly setting . They watched it sink like a plummetoff to the left of the " chopper , " as Harold called it . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the glass bubble , beside the pilot , the big tow-headed Teutonic hijacker  --  they had decided to nickname him " Hans " and his girl friend " Gretel "  --  was leaning forward and scanning the ground . Were they nearing their destination ? The pilot flew lower . He hovered . But below there was no sign of life , nothing to be seen but a ruler-straight highway running through flat unimproved land . No cars , no houses with lights in them , even though they had passed big pylons that must be for electricity . After a long pause , seemingly for inspection , the pilot continued on course , flying low above the empty highway . Far off to the left , where the sun had set , there was a gleam that was probably water , and on the right there appeared to be water too . They must be skimming over an island or a peninsula . Beside the road there were thick bushes and small , evenly planted leafless trees and what might be ditches for drainage or irrigation , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barn  --  in the gathering dusk , it was hard to tell . Yet there were no animals about , not a single cow or a sheep . " What the hell ? " said Henry Potter , speaking his first word in several hours . All at once , some lights went on below  --  lanterns , probably , for they were moving back and forth , as though signaling . In reply , the pilot put on his landing-lights . The " chopper " came slowly down , grazing the tree-tops . It landed . Right in the middle of a four-lane concrete highway . And they were expected to get out . The side-doors opened . " Welcome to Flevo/land ! " said the cheerful fellow in the whipcord . He had jumped off first , without a by-your-leave , and stood helping the others to descend . He gave a hand to the creaky old Bishop and then aided Margaret Thorp , who managed to look majestic despite her vast circumference as she was hoisted by the steward and the stewardess into his extended arms . Beryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in her teens , and turned back to assist her mother . The " wife " of the couple  --  Warren 's friends  --  helped the older " husband . " Meanwhile the team of hijackers stood by , grinning contemptuouslyat these simple displays of courtesy and doing nothing themselves to be useful . Beyond the bright circle made by the helicopter 's landing-lights , other figures could be seen , armed with rifles . Until everyone was out of the helicopter , they too merely watched , making no move . One had the impressionthey were counting the hostages . The crew , as was proper , stayed aboard till the last and occupied themselves with the hand baggage ; impatient looks passed among the hijackers as overnight cases from Gucci and Hermes were carefully lowered . " Hans " snapped his thick fingers and shouted at the crew to hurry up , setting an example by seizing a Louis Vuitton case and hurling it to the pavement  --  in the stillness , you could distinctly hear the sound of breaking glass . Then the rest of the baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stewardess and the co-pilot , who was in military uniform , like the pilot . This was a military aircraft , evidently , which helped explain the lack of amenities ; Harold said it must be used to carry paratroopers . The pilot was taking his time , methodically collecting papers and checking the equipment ; he passed a Red Cross kit down to the stewardess . " Hans " barked an order ; the lights went out , and the pilot scrambled down . In the thick dusk , you could hardly make out anything . The lanterns of the reception committee had been shaded or doused . Impossible to tell where one was or how many of these lurking figures there were . All one knew was that one had been dumped without explanation on a highway that seemed to run throughp164an absolute wilderness . Perhaps vehicles would appear to take them on the next lap of the dreadful journey  --  cars or , more likely , a truck . Yet , whichever way one looked , there was no faint beam of approaching headlights . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reeds or underbrush . Were they going to trek on foot with what was left of their worldly goods to some robbers ' den in the woods ? Or could a motor boat be moored waiting to receive them ? The water they had observed argued for that , but the thought of exchangingterra firma for still another unreliable element was more than reason was willing to entertain . They waited . At last Charles  --  bless him  --  took it on himself to confront the skulking gang , whose forms could barely be discerned in the murk . " Well , my dears , " he screeched , " I presume you do n't plan to keep us all night on this public thoroughfare . We 'd be grateful if you 'd show us promptly to our accommodations . This evening damp is most unhealthy ; one could easily take a chill , you see , and you do n't want to turn your hospitality room ' into an infirmary , do you ? " He gave that crowing laugh . A soft , gurgling sound like a suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly nudge of his weapon at Beryl 's ribs . Gretel was unamused . " You will not move from this place till we tell you . Your comfort is of no interest to us at this time . You will remain here under guard of the Palestine Liberation Army . " In other words , Beryl 's friend , the fatted calf , whom they had named " Ahmed , " and the older one with the mustache , whom they had decided to call " Abdul . " Gretel 's harsh voice continued . " And if any of you is so foolish as to try anything ' during our absence , one of your number will pay the price . " She strode through the group of captives , surveying them with a swiftly produced , pencil-sized flashlight , as though taking her pick . The choice fell on the Bishop . " He will come with us . " Whereupon she and Hans simply melted away into the shadows , along with their band of accomplices and the helpless old man , whom they had deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rose from the hostages , and the rector 's loud pleasp165to be taken instead ( the Bishop , it seemed , had a heart condition ) got only a grunt from Gretel . " And no smoking ! " Her " parting shot " was delivered from somewhere in the bushes with terrifying accuracy . " Put that pipe out ! " A pipe rattled to the pavement . Dear Gretel must have eyes in the back of her head . Absurd of her , though , to think that anyone would try to escape . True , the two Arabs did not look very fit and might be overpowered by sheer force of numbers , but where did one take it from there ? Quite apart from the horrid threat to shoot the Bishop  --  surely that was what she had implied ?  --  at the slightest false move from the others , it would be madness to strike out into this unknown terrain in mid-January and with no proper footwear to boot . By now it was pitch-dark . The hostages ' eyes , still not adjusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant helicopter a few yards away . Tomorrow it might be another story . They would be able to see the lie of the land and take their bearings from the sun . Now fog was swirling in ; no guiding stars were visible overhead , and not a glimmer of a rising moon . The most they could be sure of was that this sinister , deserted spot was somewherenear the sea . " Why , for all we know , it might be the Faroe Islands , " declared Lily . " My God , Mother ! " Beryl chided . " Did n't they give you any geography in that finishing school of yours ? " " I was speaking figuratively , " said Lily . " And you know very well that Saint Tim 's is not a finishing school . It offers an excellent education . " Good marks for Lily ! In these trying circumstances , she could have been forgiven if she had mentioned the string of schools and colleges that Beryl had been asked to leave . The luminous dial of Johnnie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unbelievable . It felt more like midnight . And a good half-hour anyway must have passed since they had been left standing here in a huddle like cattle , but there was no way of telling , as nobody had thought to check the time when they landed . Or had the pilot noted it in his log ? In the stillness , they could hear the occasional toot of ap166foghorn and the cry of a night bird , hawk or kestrel . Then , in the distance , a rustling and skittering that was surely animals , squirrels or rabbits or weasels , depending on the latitude . Finally a few in the party with sharp ears became aware of another sound , dull and regular , as of far-off pistons . " Do you hear that ? " Harold Chadwick whispered . His wife listened . " Yes . What on earth can it be , Chaddie ? " He did not know . For some reason , that rhythmic mechanical sound , in the absenceof any of the normal noises of civilization , was very unnerving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pump , " said Henry . But as they all listened , it stopped , and the night became utterly silent . Then it resumed . " It is a pump . " That was the man in the whipcord again ; his pale scarf , folded like a stock , could just be made out . In a body , the first-class hostages turned to him ; all the carefully built little social barriers came down , as of course they had to in an emergency , with everyone standing here chock-a-block . He talked with quite a strong accent , difficult to place , but he sounded like a person who was very sure of himself . What they were hearing , he said , was a pumping-station . They were in Holland . And he was Dutch himself , naturally . " But I thought you said Welcome to Flevoland ' or some name like that , " protested Beryl . She was right ; it had been somewhat misleading . But " Flevoland , " it seemed , was the name of this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Roman times that the Romans had called " Lake Flavus , " meaning yellow . " I 'll be darned , " said Johnnie . " What happened to the lake ? " Well , that was a long story , said the Dutchman , and then proceeded to tell it , as people always did when they said that . But it was interesting and gave them something to think about besides the state of their extremities and the clammy fear that was starting to creep over them like the fog . The temperature was close to freezing , and standing on the icy concrete was an ordeal , especially for the women in their thin shoes . The group was at a loss as to how to interpret Gretel 's injunction not to move  --  did it mean stay glued to the spot or could they takep167a few steps to stretch their legs instead of just shifting from foot to foot ? Anyhow , to hear the Dutchman tell it , the Roman lake and the land around it had been gradually taken over by the sea ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Zuyder Zee had been closed in from the North Sea , the old lake bottom had been drained and made into a " polder . " The highway underfoot ran along a raised dike , which was part of the system that kept the water out . But it was fresh water now , not salt  --  the Ijsselmeer , pronounced something like " ice , " he said . And this whole place they were on was a polder . " Land reclamation , " said Johnnie . " Now I get it . We 're on your Oost Polder . " ' Johnnie was amazing ; one would think that he never read a book and cared for nothing but his pictures and sailing and horses , but one forgot that his financial interests brought him in touch with all sorts of remote places and people , so that he could be a mine of the strangest information . It would not be surprising if one of his companieshad been researching these polders for investment . And once Johnnie got hold of a fact , it stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for when it might come in handy . Like tonight . The Dutchman , you could tell , was pleased as Punch to meet an American who knew something about his country . If the circumstances had been more normal , one could have expected an exchange of visiting cards . As it was , they traded names . " Van Vliet de Jonge . " " Ramsbotham . " The reason the area was so empty was that it was all new land , ready for development . The water they had noticed to the east of them was a lake with brand-new artificial beaches for tourism . A few miles to the north , an airport was under construction . There would be some light industry in the new towns , but Flevoland 's 52,000 hectares would be used mainly for cereals , sugar beets , potatoes , and dairy-farming . " What about timber ? " said Johnnie . " 4000 hectares , " answered the other . " About 46,000 will be in agriculture . " Harold interrupted . He had had his fill of this discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them sleepp168in the chopper . The Dutchman doubted it . He supposed their hideaway would prove to be a farmhouse  --  a few had already been built , well set back from the road . " You may have noticed one or two from the air . " A farmhouse , he guessed , and a barn , too , had been taken over and got ready by their confederates . " Hopefully , " said Harold , with a short laugh . " Jesus , how many are we ? " " Twenty-four , with the pilots , " said the Dutchman . " You 've got it all at your finger-tips , have n't you ? " retorted Harold , who was clearly in one of his rude moods . He was someone who was sensitive to being left out . " What makes you so sure anyway that it 's this so-called polder of yours that they 've brought us to ? " " Why , he guessed it hours ago , back in the plane , did n't he , Senator , did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economy class woman with all the rouge . " And now this pumping-station proves he was right . On a newly drained polder , he explained to us , the pumps run day and night . Maintaining the water level . " " How interesting , Mr. Van Vliet , " said Lily . " Do tell us what made you guess . " " Exercise of reason , " spoke up the Senator . " Plus being Dutch . When they asked for a helicopter , he had all the clues in his hand . " " Clues ? " " Sure . The flying range of helicopters and their capability of landing in rough terrain without a runway gave him his coordinates . And being Dutch , he was aware of polder country  --  wide open spaces with hardly any folks around . In easy flying radius of Schiphol . Your ordinary passenger plane could n't have put down here . Well , maybe a Piper Cub . But for that we were too many , as Father Time said . " " Father Time ' ? " Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't they have that on your reading-list at Saint Tim 's ? " Margaret took up the questioning . " Thank you , Beryl . Now I wonder if this gentleman will enlighten us a little further . Can you tell us , sir , how these Germans and Arabs came to be acquainted with your uninhabited polder ? Is it a matter of generalknowledge ? " Well , you could have knocked them over with a feather : " Hans " and " Gretel " were not German ; theyp169were Dutch . " You 'll have to think of some new names for them , Mother , " twitted Beryl . " And you do n't know any Dutch names , I bet . " " Naming the animals , " observed the Senator , in his dry way . " Try Rip ' as in Winkle . ' " " But Hans is a Dutch name , " declared Helen . " Remember Hans Brinker or The Silver Skates ? Mary Mapes Dodge . How I doted on that book . But I forget what his dear little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Dutch given names , Mr. Van Vliet , " ordered Margaret in her measured my-good-man tones . " Maarten , Willem , Adriaan . . . Liesbeth , Henriette . . . " " Saskia ! " interrupted Helen . But who would want to call a hijackeress after Rembrandt'sglorious young wife ? Mr. Van Vliet was thinking . " For him , you ought to have a Groningen sort of name . Gerrit . . . ? " " Never mind this name game . " Harold 's voice was raised again . " What I 'd like to hear is how our friend here knew the gang had asked for a helicopter . " Harold had a point . In first class they had not been told a word about a helicopter or any other kind of getaway plane . How was it that Economy seemed to know such a lot while firstclasspassengers had been kept totally in the dark ? " Very simple . The hijackers told me , " cheerily replied Mr. Van Vliet **36;6231;TOOLONG . Again the first-class hostages could only gasp . This man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit it . It was a horrid sensation to feel that you might have a Judas in your midst . Finally Charles , the old know-all , had the goodness to explain . Mr. Van Vliet de Jonge was a deputy in their Parliament . " The leader of his party , I believe . I knew his grandfather . Charming man . His party is in the ruling coalition , you see , and since our captors were negotiating over the wireless with the Dutch government , it was only logical that he should be chosen as intermediary . Which in turn permitted him to learn some of their demands . " " Of course , Mother , " cried Beryl . " Do n't you remember ? There was a man they took up to the pilot 's cabin . Twice , I think . That was Mr. Van Vliet de Jonge , obviously . But you people never notice anything . If you saw him , you probablyp170thought he was another hijacker . By that time , you were all drunk anyway like most of your generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  who was fainting . " " Manners , Beryl , " interposed Johnnie . " Keep your shirt on . Unlike you , honey child , the rest of us were under a strain . And , now that you mention it , I do recall somebody 's being hustled up those corkscrew steps . But I did n't take much notice . And you 're right : just about then , Eloise fainted . " When he stopped , one was almost grateful for the dark . As if to bear out Beryl 's allegation , a distinct smell of alcohol was reaching their nostrils . It must come from the Vuitton case that had been thrown down with such violence ; a bottle of whiskey must have broken  --  more likely , a pair of bottles . Still , Beryl 's outburst , whatever the foundation in fact , could not be dismissed as easily as her protector , Johnnie , seemed to think . To accuse your mother , in public , with strangers listening , of having been drunk was rather unforgivable . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Mrs. Chadwick 's la-de-da way of speaking . That was cruel . Actually nobody had been what you would call drunk , except the Potters , and Henry never showed it . When once in a great while he would have to be carried out of his club and entrusted to his chauffeur , it always came as a surprise : one minute he was erect and in full possessionof his faculties ( as far as could be judged ) , and the next he swayed and toppled over like a tall tree in a forest . It could happenat any time of day but only in the club  --  never when ladies were present . He was a gentleman to the core ; the men said that when he keeled over it was almost a noble sight , like watching a cathedral pine fall . Unfortunately Helen , who now and then took one martini too many , in order to keep him company , had no head for liquor , which led people to think that she was an alcoholic and a cross for sober Henry to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dark was doubly welcome because it gave them time to think about Charles 's revelations , and one would not like the person in question to be aware of it . There was no real reason to doubt that he was a deputy in Parliament , even though some/body like Harold might immediately want proof . Being selfmade , Harold was naturally suspicious of those who had less of this world 's goods than he had acquired , and right now one could not altogether blame him ; the present circumstances , so eerie , hardly conduced to an atmosphere of trust . But the fact that Charles had known this man 's grandfather was some sort of testimonial : Charles was awfully well connected . On the other hand , whoever one 's grandfather had been did not preventone , these days , from crossing over to the other side  --  almost the contrary ; a mother could scarcely be sure any more that her own children were not manufacturing bombs in the cellar . What really mattered in a critical moment such as this was not blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but a sense of responsibility . Was this de Jonge a responsible person ? That was what one needed to know . He might be everything that Charles claimed , a leader of his party and so on , yet he had an irresponsible air about him  --  insouciant perhaps was the word . As though the common peril was a matter of no concern . Of course that could be put on . In the morning one would be able to tell better ; one liked to see the person one was talking to , in order to judge fairly . Now there was only the voice to go by , and the accent , though not his fault , did serve as a reminder that he could speak to the chief terrorists in their own language with no one the wiser . He was a great talker , clearly , and , without , knowing more about him , one could not foresee what he might let drop to these compatriots of his , not necessarily meaningany harm . It would be wisdom to warn Helen , if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mentioning her Vermeer to him , which under ordinary conditions would be the most naturalthing for her to do were she to find herself traveling with a pleasant-spoken Dutchman . Vermeers , as she ought to know , seemed to have a fatal attraction for art thieves and declared enemies of society . There had been that shocking case , a few winters ago , of the Kenwood House Vermeer . The terrorists had seized the canvas , in broad daylight at gun-point , from the lovely house , partly Adam , just outside London that had beenp172a gift of Lord Iveagh to the public . Then they had cut strips off it and mailed them to a newspaper , just like that Getty boy 's ear . They threatened to " execute " it as an act of proletarian justice if their demands were not met by a certain date . Yet what was it , exactly , that they had wanted ? Money , naturally , and for some Irish bombers in English jails to go free , and a food distribution , or was one getting confused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these raids and kidnappings , all alike basically , that it was hard to keep the long lists of " demands " straight . In any case , the world had waited , utterly aghast at the barbarity , for the appointed day to dawn , but then the day passed and nothing happened , and eventually the picture was found , not too much the worse for wear , in a London cemetery , propped up against a gravestone . The subject of the painting  --  a girl in a yellow dress trimmed with ermine holding a guitar  --  was very similar to Helen 's ; you could almost speak of a replica , though Helen 's was an inch or two smaller and the landscape hanging on the wall behind the guitar-player was different . That was why so many of Helen 's friends had thought it was foolish of her to let hers go on show right on the heels of the Kenwood House atrocity ; it was invitinga repetition . Before that there had been the Rijksmuseum " The Love Letter , " which was stolen while on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a professional " heist " but professionals were usually not interested in mutilating pricelesstreasures  --  only in collecting the ransom ; they had nothing against the pictures as art . Normal criminality was a thing one could understand  --  the acquisitive instinct we all have , carried to wicked lengths  --  but the new wave of terrorism let loose on helpless works of art was beyond ordinary human comprehension . That Japanese woman spraying the " Mona Lisa " with red paint to protest the museum hours that she thought discriminatedagainst Japanese workers or women or whatever . It was heartbreaking to read about these sprayings and gougings and hackings , which were all politically motivated at bottom , even if it was only a crazy Australian artist 's grudge against Michel/angelo for being an acknowledged genius when he could not get recognition himself  --  so he attacked the " Pieta " in St. Peter 's . And you did not have to be a " proud possessor " to feel the hurt of it . The ordinary newspaper-reader , if the truth were told , had trembled far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst girl or even the Getty boy . " I have many grandchildren , " old Mr. Getty had commented when he let it be known that he was not going to satisfy the kidnappers ' demands . He meant that if he paid up for Paul , the gangsters would be encouraged to kidnap the rest of his descendantsone after the other . But the remark had been misinterpreted : people thought a callous old man was stating that among so many grandchildren one more or less did not matter . And if you compared the average grandchild with an irreplaceable work of art , that was true in a way , though one should n't say it . Helen had many attractive grandchildren , who would doubtlessgo on breeding and multiplying on the face of the earth , but her Vermeer was one of a kind , or almost . It was like a trust she held for posterity . The pleasure owning it gave her was only the income . Rather , what had been the pleasure ; the constant increase in burglaries , pushing up the insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a good deal of the joy out of owning beautiful things . But to let them " go public , " as business people said of old family-owned companies , was not a solution ; your precious works of art were no safer in a museum , as the Kenwood House crime proved . At any rate , Helen ought to be put on her guard . And if tomorrow , after a night 's sleep and a chance to look about , a council of war were held , to discuss the situation and size up the chances of escape , it would be fairer to de Jonge to manage to leave him out of it . Or if negotiation , instead , were decided on  --  one could always try  --  they should be chary of taking him into their confidence . One of their own group , by rights , should be the spokesman , since it was money , to put it coarsely , that would be talking . . . . Now the moon was trying to show itself , and a few stars twinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted , and ,  |p174besides  , their eyes had adjusted to the darkness . It had to do with the pupils dilating or else contracting , one or the other  --  Harold , who had started out as a pharmacist , would probably know . They saw Beryl plump herself down on the pavement ; she had plenty of padding but she would ruin her nice coat . The others had found it wiser to stay on their feet and keep exercising their limbs  --  the Senator was throwing imaginary pitches . The temperature was dropping ; you could tell because the pavement was getting slippery  --  a thin glaze of ice had started to form . Along each side of the road ran a ditch , too deep to see whether it held water . Beyond , there were tall reeds or sedges , and some distance off , perhaps half a mile , in the directionfrom which they had heard the foghorn , they could now make out a house of sorts , distinguishable by the roof line , and a big looming shed or barn . No lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . What had happened to their captors ? No one was talkingany more . Each seemed to be wrapped in his thoughts . The younger of Warren 's two friends had assumed a yoga posture . Helen 's head jerked on her neck ; she was falling asleep on her feet . At that point , forceful Margaret decided to take the reins in her hands . " Rector , " she ordered . " Give us an evening prayer . " When he launched into " Lighten our darkness , we beseech thee , 0 Lord , " everyone had to laugh  --  it was so appropriate . Then , looking around like a chairwoman , she called on Van Vliet to tell them what kind of government his country had . " Wait a minute , " burst in Harold . " Do n't say it . Let me have one guess . Socialist . " He had scored on the first try , which seemed to give him some grim satisfaction , though you would think he would rather have been wrong . " Thanks , Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know what ? " demanded Beryl . " Know what ? " echoed the woman with the wailing Southern voice . They saw the Senator turn his head to listen . Dear Lily undertook to pour oil on the troubled waters . " There are socialists and socialists , Harold . One has to know which kind . " " There 's only one kind , " retorted Harold . The Senator gave a brief laugh and went back to pitching . Johnniep175came to Lily 's aid . In his understanding , he said , Holland was something like England  --  what they liked to call a " welfare state , " with the Queen and Labor . " And is n't Holland in NATO ? " ventured Lily . " I feel sure I read that somewhere . " " You 're thinking of Belgium , Mother . " But Lily was right . Indeed Holland was in NATO , Mr. Van Vliet assured them . And he tiptoed over to the " whirlybird " and tenderly patted the little tail-propeller . " The NATO shield . " Even Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . The " chopper " was part of the NATO defense screen . Mr. Van Vliet 's government had borrowed it from the Germans . To oblige a team of international terrorists . " A crazy world , " summed up Lily 's rector-as-was . But after that " light moment , " despondency returned . Seven o'clock came and still no sign of the main hijackers . " Abdul " and " Ahmed " were talking in low voices . Maybe they too were getting worried . Harold wondered why Dutch planes had not started looking for the party . " Christ , our course could have been plotted by radar . They ought to have pinpointed where we are . By now we should have heard some action overhead . " But the partly covered sky was silent , and a new tooting of foghornsindicated a very obvious reason : no search plane would undertake a mission in this weather . " I 'm scared , Chaddie , " said Eloise . In fact they were all growing frightened . Older people could perish of exposure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskey still emanating from the Vuitton case was tantalizing , to say the least . What a pity that Henry had not packed his private stock more carefully . If another half-hour were to pass in this vain waiting , some initiative would have to be taken . Everyone might decide to move in a body back into the helicopter , where at least there were seats and some shelter . Or start a bonfire  --  there were those leafless young trees along the road that appeared to be poplars ; the men could tear branches off , although the wood might be too damp to burn . But first one would have to convince the two Arabs , who must be freezing themselves , to let them disobeyGretel 's order ; perhaps Beryl could try.  |p176Life  was full of irony . The last thing one would have expectedwas that one would find oneself longing for Hans and Gretel to return . Why were they staying away so long ? Had something dreadful happened back there in that house ? The conspirators might have got into an argument and killed each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiring the place with explosives . But then one would have heard the noise . The wildest conjectures must be passing through every mind , though no one dared voice them . It was like being left by one 's nurse as a child in the park with one 's pail and shovel and told to stay put till she came back . The fears that rose to assail one when she did not appear for hours and one 's little feet were getting cold ! That she had been run over by a car , that she had got lost in the park , that the bogey-man had taken her , that she had just walked off on purpose and was never coming back . That sense of utter abandonment  --  it was odd to feel it now . And the same fear one had had then of disobeying by going to look for her . Nurse , as one knew now , had simply been off with some young man and when she came back , she was cross that one was frightened and made one promise not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such experiences , and they leave a mark . Of course the situations were not parallel . One had usually loved Nurse . One had wanted her never to leave . While if one was sure that Hans and Gretel had disappeared for good , it would be bliss beyond belief . It was the doubt that was so harrowing . Rather than remain a prey to useless guessing and imagining , not to mention desperately hungry and chilled to the bone , almost anybody , actually , would prefer to see their scowling faces . It was normal to be silently pleading for them to come back soon : " Please , Hans and Gretel , where are you ? " And the Bishop , too , of course . How strange to have almost forgotten about him.  |p177It  would be an exaggeration to say that these people had never been so glad to see anyone in their lives . More exactly ( Sophie estimated ) , no sound of footsteps had ever been so welcome to them as the purposeful tread advancing almost in march-timetheleaders had changed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally , they were perceived again in their true colors  --  hardly had they shown their faces when it was obvious that the leopard had not changed his spots . Absent , they had been idealized : it was curious how , within the mere space of an anxious hour or so , the group huddled here had succeeded in forgetting what their captors had been like . Apprehensionas to what was coming next would have been the rational emotion . Instead , if her own feelings were an index , the nearing steps of the kapers , heralded by a distant snapping of twigs , had evoked simple gratitude : they were a rescue party . Their return meant food , shelter , sleep , possibly a blanket  --  civilization . At any rate , to Sophie : she had been picturing the shadowy house off there as a sort of canteen or mess , with cauldrons of hot soup , bread , Dutch cheese , coffee . She had not eaten a full meal for seventy-two hours . And for the older people , people of her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was hungry , and her legs , encased like sausages in these elegant leather boots , had lost all feeling . Yet as a journalist she was familiar with rough assignments  --  she had humped about in army trucks and slept in a cave alongsidep178guerrillas eager to be interviewed ; she had lived for days on a diet of black beans and rice  --  and furthermore she was thirtysix , still young . The older people , with their hardening arteries and poor circulation , not to mention proneness to worry , could only be objects of compassion to someone so junior and so far ahead in experience . For their sake , she tried to picture army cots in the house or . barn or at least rows of mattresses ; if this was to last long , sleep would become essential for keeping a steady head . For her , hay or the floor would do , if only she could get these boots off  --  a razor , she feared , might be required . She felt sorriest for the art collectors . A millionaire 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage . Perhaps , in the light of present-day trends , they should be getting special trainingcourses to harden them up for the eventuality . But in fact the collectors had borne up remarkably well , and she wondered whether her parents could have equaled them  --  they had the double handicap of being semi-rich and Jewish , which taken together seemed to soften the fibre . These super-rich Wasps had been lambs on the whole : no complaints , no moans , just the stately silliness proper to their station in life . The only black sheep among them had been the quarrelsome man with the Midwestern accent and the younger wife ; it was hard to imagine what art he collected  --  cock-fighting subjects ? On the fringe , as if not quite accepted among the super-rich , was a pair of queens with the usual age difference between them . They were bearing up well too , considering the fact that they were on the fringe . She tried to guess what the parched old one collected  --  theother probably cooked , drove the car , and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Klimmt , Cocteau , Japanese erotica . The fat girl , Beryl Somebody , Sophie remembered from school ; she was the one who had appeared in the sixth-form year with a trunkful of incredible clothes that she had cut to pieces with a pinking shears on a dreary Sunday afternoon in a fit of misery or boredom while her roommate looked on . It was easy to sympathize with the act , which had contrived to get her expelled  --  a thing that almost never happened at Putneyp179and caused her to stand out in the memory as someone who had put Mrs. H. 's progressiveness to the supreme test . She deserveda commemorative plaque , really , for exposing the hypocrisyof the place . It had been odd to find her again , traveling with her mother and dressed in a long lustrous matronly mink coat but otherwise not much changed from the old Beryl . She was still fat and flaxen with made-up electric blue eyes that blinked like a china doll 's and still a disciplinary problem , or so it sounded . Sophie saw that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that Beryl remembered her too . " Hi , there , " she had muttered over her shoulder as they were boarding the helicopter . Later they might have a chat , dormitorystyle , when Sophie 's boots were off and the older generationwould be snoozing , having taken its Valium or sleepingpill . But something was wrong with that picture . They were not going to be bedded down yet . And where was the Bishop ? The hijackers had not brought him back with them . The realization seemed to steal over the whole group of hostages in the course of an instant , as though they were one body that had been nudged to attention . What had this pair done with the nice old man ? Near her , eyebrows shot up , making points of interrogation ; shrugging shoulders replied in dumb show . Nobody , Sophie supposed , wished to be the one to ask , partly for fear of learning the answer but mostly for fear of angering their hosts  --  if ' that was the right word for these redoubtable people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unapproachable  --  they were over by the helicopter arguing heatedly with the pilot ; their voices were raised  --  and the Arabs , though available , could claim not to know . If other members of the band had come back with the leaders , they were waiting silently in the bushes . Sophie told herself that there could be an innocent explanation for the Bishop 's disappearance , and no doubt her fellowhostageswere telling themselves the same thing . He might be asleep , for instance . Yet this sop she was offering her conscience for not speaking up  --  " Where is the Bishop ? " she was free top180shout , or " Please , where is Bishop Hurlbut ? "  --  failed to be effective , since from long experience she recognized it as a sop . She sensed in herself a reluctance to antagonize that she knew too well , a disabling reluctance for someone in her profession . She had proof of her physical courage and the courage of her pen , but spoken words , for her , were different . It was not mere dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like to ask a point-blank question when the anticipated reply , or evasion , was something only a prosecuting attorney could pounce on with joy . She had given long thought to this subject ; was it tact or shyness or femininity that inhibited her ? She was sure that if she had had the bad fate to interview Nixon , she would have helped him cover up , at least while she sat in his office under his shifty eye . Poor girl ( she sighed to herself ) , she wanted to be " clean . " She always pitied confessors , who in their stuffy intimate boxes had to hear and wash away such a lot of dirty sins . And tonight , added to that squeamishnesswas a plain , weak , selfish desire not to incur the special hostility of " Hans " and " Gretel , " as the collectors were calling them  --  naming the animals , the Senator had observed . She was the only Jew , she guessed , in this whole caboodle ; why should it fall to her to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized his duty . They watched him approach the Arab guard and secure a permission , apparently . Then he brought out a pocket handkerchief  --  plaid , but in the dark it could pass for white  --  and holding it up as a truce flag he manfully crossed the open ground to the helicopter , where the second pilot had joined the loud debate . Two flashlight beams played over the tall missionary form . " He 's asking , " Simmons marveled . " I would n't have the courage ; honestly , would you ? But then he has to . Being his brother 's keeper , I mean . " " He 's getting the bum 's rush , " commented Harold . It was true . In two shakes of a lamb 's tail , the parson was hurtling back toward his companions ; a rough final shove from the older Arab caused him to slip on the icy pavement  --  he fell . " I guess they mean business , " he said , trying to laugh as he picked himself up . He applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was only a scrape . " And so what did they tell you ? " Sophie demanded . " Nothing . Not a darned thing . She just gave me a piece of her mind for butting in . Quite a scold , she is . A regular martinet . " Soon the woman herself strode up , as if to enforce the lesson poor Mr. Barber had got . The dispute with the pilots  --  whatever it had been about  --  seemed to be over . But something had left her in a vicious humor . " We are not here to answer your questions . We are not accountable to you swine . You were ordered not to disperse , and one of you has disobeyed . Now you will form a line , quickly . We have no time to waste . " The erect old collector reached for his wife 's dressing-case . " Here you are , Helen . Margaret , my dear , where 's yours ? " " Drop that case ! " exclaimed the woman . " And form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our things , " protested Harold 's wife . " Our night things , do n't you see , so as to go to bed . " She might have been explaining matters to a child , Sophie thought . " Teddybye , " do-do , ' " the mincing voice went on . " Forget do-do , Mrs. Parasite , " said the-woman . " You are going to be put to work . " " Me ? " " Some of you . All of you . We will decide . " What work could she mean ? Uncertainly , the hostages lined up and faced the two confederates . Like confused recruits , they did not understand the order and were too frightened to ask more . All that was clear to Sophie was that the leaders were making a selection . They went down the long line using their little flashlightslike methodical probes . After a brief appearance the moon had gone in again , and the last few stars were covered . The dancing rays of light made the dark seem darker . Sophie was glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right side and on her left Jim Carey , who laced his fingers firmly in hers and murmured " Whatever 's coming , let 's the three of us try to stay together . " On his other side was Simmons ; a faint shriek came from that quarter . " He was feeling me , Jim , " the wailing voice confided . " What part of you ? " asked the Senator . " I guess you 'd call it my biceps , " she admitted , raising a laugh . " Auschwitz , " muttered Sophie , not finding this very funny . Paranoia , perhaps , but it did seem to her that a Nazi-style sifting of thosep182fit to work was going on . What would they do with the others  --  kill them or save the ammunition and leave them to die of exposure ? She asked herself what it meant that neither of the two had bothered to test her muscles . Again she considered the fact of being Jewish : did that classify her as fit to work or the opposite ? Hunger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would account for the somber imaginingsthat were assailing her  --  her own special pink elephants ; her parents had got out of Frankfurt early , but distant relatives from the French branch had died in the ovens . " Fall out , " barked the woman . Sophie jumped . " Ahmed , take him away . " It was Charles the woman was speaking of . How shameful to feel relief . Yet the elimination of Charles threw a new and terribly clear light on the Bishop 's disappearance . In a flash the confusion in her head was replaced by hyper-lucidity . The old and the unfit . " Take him away "  --  a code expression , most likely , on the model of " the final solution " or " Waste ' em " in Vietnam . At the same time , in another part of her mind she was finding it wildly comical that " Ahmed 's " name was Ahmed . And in still a differentcompartment , her brain was working on a hideous new theory : the Bishop had died of a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were picking a burial squad . Sophie could not stand it . " I 'm going to demand that they tell us . If they wo n't say where he is , it means they 've done away with him . " " What good will it do us to know , Sophie ? " Carey said gently , stroking her cold fingers . " It always does good to know , " Sophie said passionately , pushing his hand away . " No talking there ! " shouted the man 's voice . A flashlight was turned in their direction . In its path Sophie distinctly saw  --  unless it was a hallucination  --  afigure carrying a shovel crossing the road . Her knees began to buckle . " Henk ! " she appealed , in a whisper . He was not there . It was like waking up from a bad dream and finding the place beside you empty . But he had merely stepped forward , without saying a word . The leaders saw him . " Back in line there , Deputy . Take your place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there quite coolly ( shep183could tell from his profile and the tilt of his chin ) , his head thrown back as if idly contemplating the sky . As she watched , he calmly folded his arms and continued to gaze upward , like the musing figure of a poet in a German Romantic painting  --  all he lacked was a black cloak wrapped around him . Sophie smiled ; in this half-minute she had grown uncannily calm herself . No doubt it was the advent of real danger that had done it . She ought to tremble at his daring ; instead , she was content  --  perhaps the true word was " thrilled "  --  that he was standing his ground . If Henk did not move , she reasoned , they would come over to him themselves . The odds were that they would not shoot him unless they had to . A little plume of white vapor , like smoke , came from the nostril she could see and made her think of a bull-god snorting . And of course he was not a political animalfor nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the woman materialized from the shadows , drawn as if by a magnet or by common , normal curiosity  --  an underrated force of attraction . Henk shifted his head in their direction , like somebody who thought he had heard visitors . The man said something in Dutch . Henk answered with a word that sounded like " Nay . " Stepping up rather too close to him , the woman pointed her flashlight into his face . He ignored it and started talking to the man . Then he made an irritable gesture , as if to ward off the beam of light , like a buzzing fly , from his eyes . The man 's hand suddenly closed over the woman 's ; he clicked her flashlight off . His own he kept pointed at the pavement , lighting up patches of ice . Henk continued . " He 's asking about the Bishop , " Sophie murmured to Carey . " I heard him say ' bisschop . ' " They strained their ears to follow . Carey caught the words " oud man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the rapid exchange went on , they could pick up less and less . Their German was not much help ; the pronunciation was too different . The recurring " Nay , " a nasal sound , was evidently " No " or " Nein , " and the woman kept interrupting with what sounded like " haast hebben , " which might be kin to German " Die Hast " and English " hurry . "  |p184If  so , she was not the only impatient one . From the far end of the line , the unmistakable voice of Harold called out . " What 's going on ? What are you telling them , de Jonge ? " He must have received a cuff or a sharp poke from an Arab gun butt , for there was a loud grunt and he subsided . The discussion in Dutch went on . The word " helicopter , " however spelled , was being pronounced . Sophie turned quickly to Carey . He had got it too . He emitted a soft whistle . She could not guess what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a sudden joyful suspicion . Was the Bishop going to be evacuated , as an act of mercy  --  " medevac , " the Army would have called it in Vietnam  --  and Charles too ? " Bishop , " " old man , " " helicopter , " even " hebben haast "  --  it all added up to that . As for the workdetailthe leaders had been choosing , that could be for ordinary chores ; collecting firewood , for instance , or KP  --  nothing would make her happier now than to be set to peeling potatoes , especiallyif she knew than an ailing old cleric and his ancient crony were going to be flown out . She blessed Henk for his gift of persuasion . The hulking man , she estimated , was more than half convinced ; at least he was listening and nodding his head up and down , as if pondering . And the woman was staying out of it . Her restless flashlight was on again , playing over the pavement . Sophie 's eye absently followed it . She froze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nay , " Van Vliet was saying . Just down the row , another voice , pleasanter than Harold 's , intervened  --  Beryl 's mother . " Dear Mr. Van Vliet , do n't argue with them . You 're only making them cross . Let 's just do as we 're told and get it over with . " " Can it , Mother . We 're not meant to be talking , do n't you realize that ? " But Henk answered , and the big fellow did not stop him . Sophie tried to listen , but her attention kept wandering . Had no one else noticed the shovels ? She touched Carey 's sleeve and pointed . He shrugged . He was more interested in what Henk was saying  --  something about being a lawyer and advice being his profession . Could she be wrong in the dire conclusion she had leapt to ? Leaping to conclusions was a bad habit with her.  |p185Would  n't they be spades rather than shovels if a grave was to be dug ? She ordered herself to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told the two leaders in Dutch . " They have said that they are not accountable to us . In strict power terms that is true . But I counsel them that it is in their own interest not to keep us in ignorance when they need our cooperation . " Sophie bridled . " Cooperation ? " she muttered to Carey . What did that mean ? They were in a no-choice situation ; they had to cooperate . He was a charming , absurd Dutchman , over-trained in coalition politics . Nevertheless , she reminded herself , softening , he was brave , and for that she owed him some attention . Slave labor , he was saying , was alwaysinefficient . " That is known from the camps . But in the gulag there were millions , so the low productivity of each individualunit was unimportant ; in the scale of things it did not matter . " Why was Henk telling all this to the hostages , half of whom could not care less ? Then slowly she understood : he was really addressing himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat an argument that he had been making in camera . It was a parliamentary trick , to use an attentivegallery to make your point sink in , as though doubling the size of the audience doubled the force of your words . And possibly it did . " Here tonight , " he continued cheerily , " the labor force is very small . Perhaps thirty persons . They need the full productivity of thirty persons and therefore they must pay for it . " " Pay ' ? That 's a bit stiff , is n't it , under the tires ? " The collector called Ramsbotham laughed in a worldly way , as if he thought poor Henk quite mad or in need of a business education . Henk took his meaning . " I am not a simple , ' as we say in Dutch . No . Ask yourself a question . What have our friends here got that we have n't ? " " Guns , " yelled Harold . " Evidently , " said Henk . " But what else ? " No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay us in information . " " Your Bishop is alive , " the woman said abruptly . " He has not been harmed . No one will be harmed at this stage of the operation that behaves himself . He is too old , simply , for the work , and we have told him so . He will only be in the way . "  | " The work ? " echoed Beryl 's mother . " You will see , " said the man . " Now fall out , madam . Fall out again , funny old gentleman . " That was Charles , who had slipped back into line  --  doubtlessto hear better . " And you , Deputy , fall in . " It ought to have been plain as a pikestaff . It was a question of moving the helicopter . Henk had guessed it before they told him . Jim Carey had guessed it . That was the " work . " As soon as the fog cleared , or in the morning at the very latest , search planes would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half an hour ago , that none had come yet . The helicopter would have to be hidden . It could not be left standinghere all night in plain view . That of course they could not leave it parked on the highway was a fact of life too obvious to have escaped Sophie 's attention ; she would have had to be a total idiot not to see that . But she had given no consideration to the mechanics of its removal ; when they were ready , the pilot , she had assumed , would taxi it off the road to some nearby hiding-place . All that would have been thought through . But in the dark she had failed to notice something that the men had seen at once : the helicopter did not have wheels ; it had skids . Yet why claim the dark as an excuse ? The truth was that she had not used her eyes , while the men had . And even if at some point she had vaguely taken note of the skids , she would probably have failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not taxi . Having to hear that explained to her now , jointly , by Henk and Jim made her blush for herself as a journalist . She would fire herself had she been here on assignment , charged with " covering " the event . She hated imperceptiveness , most of all in herself . And being a woman , alas , had something to do with this particular lapse from grace ; women did not think about machinery . Henk said that the hijackers themselves had failed to notice the skids at Schiphol . They had become aware of them here . And right away they had got angry at the pilots . But it was not the pilots who had flown the aircraft in from Germany . They were Dutch Air Force men and the Germans who had broughtp187it had turned it over as it stood , complete with the operations manual for the Dutchmen to figure out . Still , commented Sophie , you would think that these Dutch would have mentioned the skids while the helicopter was still at Schiphol and it would not have been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : there was not a set of wheels in Holland that would fit this model . His placid tone irritated her ; she wanted blame to be assigned . Then why in the world , she said crossly , did the Germans send one with skids ? Henk shrugged . At this time of year the craft was probably used for paratrooper trainingexercises on snow and ice ; when the order came down from the Ministry , nobody at the base had thought to put on wheels . Very natural , too , said Carey . " These birds should have sent their specifications along . Hell , they might have got pontoons . " The two men laughed . Being males , they found the quandary amusing . So , since the helicopter could not taxi , it was going to have to be pushed or pulled . The road was icing up nicely , Carey estimated , testing it with his feet . " But that 's impossible , " Sophie protested . " Why ca n't the pilot fly it to wherever they want it to go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But the pilot had refused . The argument just now had been about that . " You could hear it all ? " said Carey . " Enough , " Henk said , " to seize the drift . Or do you say catch the drift ' ? " " Get the drift , ' " said Sophie , feeling quite impatient . " But go on . Why did the ' pilot refuse ? " " Not enough room for maneuver , " answered the Senator . " If he took it up and tried to turn it on a dime in these conditions , there 'd be a fair chance of a foul-up . " " And he was unwilling to take the chance , " observed Sophie . " Why did n't they ask the co-pilot if he was so afraid ? " Henk said that the co-pilot had agreed with the pilot . " These fellows are Dutch and stubborn . " He held up a finger , recommendingquiet . Over by the helicopter , the argument with the pilots had resumed . And no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of hostages ought to have convinced them that the job could not be done by manpower  --  sheer madness even to consider it . " They are telling that the helicopter is thep188property of the German air arm , " Henk reported . " And they say the Royal Dutch Air Force has responsibility for this property . " " Kind of funny , " said Carey . " I mean to be harping on property and responsibility when you want to make an anarchistsee your point . " Then all at once the discussion was over . The big hijacker and the co-pilot were underneath the helicopter , looking up at something . The pilots had won their point . Carey said he was not surprised . On balance , he guessed , the hijackers could not have been too eager to see the helicopter take off with the Royal Dutch Air Force at the controls . " Nothing much to prevent them from flying it back to Schiphol , would n't you say , Henk ? Then good-bye getaway craft . " " But why do they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Carey , and let it go at that . The pilot was now inside the helicopter . From the bottom he was letting out a long cable . " Standard equipment , " said Carey . " A hoist , they call it . Used for making drops and pick-ups normally . He has a winch in there that 's operated by a motor . " He had been a flyer , Sophie remembered , in the Second World War . The cable unwound and lay on the pavement , in coils , like a thin black snake . " But I thought we were going to push , " said Sophie . " They 'll try the hoist for now , " Carey said . " But I expect the time for pushing will come . " The lazy voice broke off . Suddenly there was a great deal of action . It was as though a whistle had been blown . First , the male hostages were quickly separated from the women and formed into a squad , which was set to work unwinding the cable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All were dressed in windbreakers and baggy pants , but one might be a woman  --  she was too far off still to tell . Two stayed by the cable , watching it play out , and two ran off to a point several yards up the highway . They had brought lanterns with them , and now you could see better . But without Carey to brief her , Sophie felt at a loss . She could not make out what was happening , exactly . The pair up the highway was shouting in rapid German . " Ja ! " " Nein , " " Doch , das stimmt , " " Nein . Es stimmt nicht . " Eventually it dawned on her : they werep189looking for a tree to fix the cable to . But the trees along the road were just big saplings  --  willows , Sophie thought , and she tried to remember from her parents ' property whether willow was a soft wood or a hard wood . There could not be any fullgrowntrees anywhere here ; the polder was too new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road no telephone poles . Nothing stout and fixed to anchor onto . And no hope of a big jutting rock ; the land was perfectly flat  --  level seabottom . She was not surprised that Carey had sounded skeptical . Yet the confederates , apparently , had found a tree , several yards further up the road , that they thought would suit the purpose , for one of them called out " Jeroen ! Ja , ja ! Hier ! " and the tall Dutch hijacker  --  they were big , Henk said , in the fen-lands he came from  --  went up to consult with them . Then an order was given , and the hostages hoisted the cable onto their shoulders and marching in step , spaced out in single file , carried it up the road till the order to halt came . The frieze of toiling figures with the cable stretched between them looked curiously like a chain gang silhouetted against the night sky . The end of the cable reached , but there could not be much slack , because a wait followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk , cursing in a babel of tongues ( " Merde ! " cried the voice of Henk ) . Finally the laborers fell back . There was a sound of cranking and groaning as the winch turned and the cable tautened . The helicopter moved . It was proceedingon a diagonal to the highway 's edge . The problem , of course , was the skids . The thin glaze of ice on the highway was uneven , and halfway along the great hulk seemed to balk . You could hear the skids scrape on the pavement . " Halt ! " called the co-pilot and went over to inspect . There was a consultation . No damage seemed to have been done , and the hijackers , apparently , had been prepared for a setback . An emollient of some kind , Sophie guessed , was needed to grease the skids ; the ice was too patchy . She thought madly of Dutch butter . But mud , it seemed , was the answer , and there was no shortage of it in the ditch beside the highway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put to work . Pails were produced , and two groups were formed , one to carry the pails , which " Gretel " was rapidly filling , and the other to apply the contents by hand to the stretch of pavement in front of the runners . The new confederate , who was in fact a woman , pale , thin , German , and young , seized the second shovel and followed Gretel 's example . While this was going on , the men took places at the rear of the helicopter , to start pushing when the word came  --  they would push in concert with the turning winch . Having lost  --  or wasted  --  so much time , the hijackers were now in a great hurry . But the pails were small , almost like children 's pails , and the mud was cold ; actually there were splinters of ice in it . Sophie 's hands ached , and she looked with pity at the manicured fingernails of Harold 's wife , which showed a blackishred in the lantern light . In Sophie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages use a shovel to smooth the mud onto the pavement rather than have them slather it on like cold cream with their bare hands . But the shovels were reserved for the use of Gretel and the other . Rather than trust the captives with them , they leaned on them during pauses to watch contemptuously , like forewomen , while the feeble carriers bore off their dripping loads . At length the leadership was satisfied with the slippery state of the pavement , and the pilot resumed his place . The winch turned , the men pushed , but , instead of advancing , the helicopterwas sliding backward . The cable was pulling the tree , which slowly rose , turned a sort of somersault , exposing its roots , and was dragged along the road . A sound of clucking came from the women . " Sheer vandalism , " Sophie 's nearest neighbor pronounced . " Do n't you agree ? When one thinks of the money this government must have spent planting those trees . . . " Yet they were going to try again , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rather sympathized with her neighbor : before they were through , they would have ripped up every tree in the area . But at least this next one , unlike its predecessor , had not been weakened by a first assault . And the hijackers this time were trying ap191new strategy . A rope was brought from the helicopter and tied to the tree trunk . The workers were redistributed . Males , both hostages and hijackers , were assigned to pull on the rope , to hold the tree steady when the winch started its counter-pull , while the women , all of them , were to push the helicopter from the rear . They practiced , then " One , two , three ! " the fen-land giant counted . The cable tightened . The helicopter moved forward . They had done it . But the job was not yet over . The ditch they had been digging in constituted a new hazard . It was not very wide ; nevertheless there was the danger that one of the skids could slip into it and tip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate they now knew his name , which rhymed with " shoon " ; was it Dutch for " Jerome " ?  --  stood with his hands on his hips , studying the ditch . He measured the skids and shook his head . Then he called to Ahmed , who brought him a small ax , of the kind used for cutting firewood . Seizing it in his huge hands , he set to work to chop branches off the young willows till he had enough to fill in the ditch at the point the helicopter would cross . Here there was no question of using the winch . Again the women got behind to push ; in front , the work-gang of men pulled on the cable . Without gloves , their hands slipped ; it was hard to get a purchase . But the bed of twigs and branches was wet and slimy ; in half a minute the helicopter was across. - Now there was less hurry . Even though the helicopter was still visible , it was not blocking the road to a truck or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men at that pumping-stationand if they worked in shifts , some could be arriving or leaving at any hour of the night . This highway must connectwith the mainland , where people lived , and to Sophie it was a miracle that no vehicle so far had appeared . And if one had , what would the hijackers have done ? Taken whoever was in it prisoner , she supposed . But then the car would have to be hidden too . At any rate it would have had wheels . And if the night-shift worker had had a family , would n't somebody have given the alarm when he failed to come home ? All the time they had been pushing and shoving she had been worrying , shep192realized , that a car would come before they finished , and now that that danger no longer mattered much  --  in the dark a driver would be concentrating on the road and not looking to see what was beside it  --  she pushed the damp fringe back from her forehead and breathed easier . There remained the thick underbrush to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she noticed , already ran through it , and the vegetation was crushed and trampled in places . But the track was too narrow for the helicopter to pass . It would have to be widened . Otherwise , she guessed , the rotor blades might get tangled in the tall reeds . Or some other damage could befall its vital parts . Fatigue was making her unmechanical brain even more hazy : in Vietnam she had ridden in dozens of helicopters and actually come under fire from the ground once , yet now she could not even remember where their engines were exactly . But she was right about widening the path . While the teams of hostages rested and the men mopped their brows ( " Wonderful exercise ! " she heard the minister proclaim ) , Ahmed busied himself with the ax . His progress along the thicket 's encroaching edges was maddeningly slow , and behind him he left masses of snarled reeds and prickly branches , which the others , following in his wake , had to clear away . Carey , walking beside her and watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience . " Here , let me have that , " he said and proceeded to cut a clean swath , rapidly felling bushes on either side as he went . There came a piercing whistle . " Put that ax down ! " It was strange how these people , though they must be even more tired than the hostages , could be so alert . They must have their wits about them to be instantlyconscious of the deadly-weapon potential latent in an ax or a mere shovel . Or was it not , rather , dim-witted on their part to be so fiercely suspicious ? One thing they were incapable of divining , it seemed , was the impulse to be helpful common to most Americans  --  otherpeople had it but not to the same degree . In America , if you were not born with it , they taught it to you in school . Carey 's was just a reflex reaction to the sight ofp193incompetence ; it hurt the American farm boy in him to watch somebody use an ax that badly . Nor was it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving this oversize helicopterto safety had produced something like a team spirit even in the bystanders . Once indignation over the tree-uprootinghad subsided , there had been a quick shower of advice , to which Simmons of course had contributed but also the queenly mammoth they called Margaret : " You will have more traction , I think , Harold , if you shift your position somewhat more to the right . " More remarkable : a pair of pale yellow gloves had been silently tendered to the cable-pullers , relayed  --  too late , as it happened  --  from Charles , banished to the shadows but evidently taking an active interest . And now poor Ahmed had managed to cut his thumb ; instead of letting it bleed , the Air France stewardess promptly came forward with her first-aid kit . These little occurrences touched Sophie . Of course it was in the stewardess 's training . And of course Ahmed was by way of becoming everybody 's pet hijacker . But something more was at work , Sophie felt  --  an endearing , irrational , human tendency to make common cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-interest than the project of hiding this helicopter . Finally the path was declared to be wide enough . Ahmed 's place had been taken by a gaunt new Palestinian even less adept . " I guess in the desert they do n't get much use for an ax , " summed up Carey . Henk had gone ahead merrily at the wood-chopper 's side , and now he reported what he had been able to see : a typical gabled Dutch farmhouse , two stories high , and near it a barn in construction  --  it lacked one wall and a roof . The helicopter was ready to move . There was no need for fresh mud ; the ground here , being marshy and half-frozen , was naturally slippery  --  a point the pastor had demonstrated by another sorry tumble . There were also , Henk said , crusted remnants of a snowfall in the open space around the barn , where the helicopter would obviously go . From now on the job would be easy . And in fact that was so . The only difficulties were interposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nar/row side  --  either thanks to Ahmed and his successor or because the hijackers had not wanted to make it too wide , in case it would be noticeable from the air  --  and to keep the helicopter straight on course , free of interference from protruding briars and branch-ends , seemed to have become a point of honor with the flyers , who from time to time shouted " Halt ! " and brought everything to a standstill , as though a few scratches on the German paint job would matter . It was their training , Sophie supposed . But the kapers were humoring them , and the helicoptermade it to the barn . Urging it in , finally , was the simplest part . It really looked as though Providence were working on the hijackers ' behalf . That the barn lacked a wall and a roof could not have been better for their purposes . If the roof had been on , the helicoptercould not possibly have fitted under it , and the open side was a made-to-order portal . The unfinished barn was a perfect berth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a builder to function as a hangar . And lying around , as though in readiness , were sheets of builders ' tar paper and a carpenter 's ladder . It was quick work for the more able-bodied hostages , following the northlander 's instructions , to climb up and fit the tar paper loosely over the top , like a tent , resting on the outspread blades . When the job was finished , the lanterns were put away , and everyone stood back to admire . As though at the command of a stage electrician , the moon came out , to provide a ghostly lighting . Standing back , you would never know that a helicopter was garaged here unless you were directly in front , facing the open side . And from the air , that would not matter ; from the air , the illusion would be complete . A search plane would see only a typical barn in the process of construction , and the tar paper might have been laid over the top to keep the damp out . No jungle camouflage , Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A light blanket of snow would add a touch , " commented Jim . He himself was a wet blanket , Sophie told him . Her legs had regained feeling , and she momentarily forgot being hungryp195in a general glow of satisfaction  --  Veblen 's pride of workmanship , it must be , though her own part had been small . The other hostages , too , had been reanimated ; interest had shifted to the dark farmhouse and what it might contain by way of amenities . " Will there be a toilet ? " Simmons wondered . Beryl 's mother was hoping for a " bathe "  --  even a sponge bath . The men 's thoughts ran to food and heating : better not be counting on steaks , though , and Ramsbotham understood that Holland had an oil shortage . Henk , as the authority , was be-  --  sieged with eager questions : would they heat with gas maybe , how many rooms in a farmer 's house , any hope of a frigidaire ? For these poor souls , merely naming those " necessities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with cautious pessimism , could not fail to bring on a mood of anticipation . " Will they let us get our things now ? " said Harold 's wife . Certainly by now they had earned a good night 's rest and something hot to eat . But the hijackers did not see it that way . From their point of view , there was still work to be done . Obviously the path that had just been widened would have to be restored to at least a semblance of its earlier state , so that from the air it would look as if nothing more than a builder 's truck had used it , to bring in materials . They could not just quit and go to bed . With reluctance , Sophie conceded that , and Jim Carey , beside her , was nodding his agreement as the leader , leaning against the barn wall , went down the list of tasks that remained . A squad of hostages was to collect sedge , lopped-off branches , and so on , to fill in the sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in place and all traces of disturbance cleared off the highway . To Sophie , it was as if a stage were about to be set , with the hostages as sceneshifters , and she asked herself whether so much verisimilitude was really necessary  --  could there be an element of sadistic enjoyment ? " And our toilet cases ? " prompted Harold 's wife , whose chief interest probably lay in her eight-hour cream . Curious , though , that the hijackers had omitted to mention the detail of the hostages ' " things " ; now that the helicopterp196was gone , the pile of cases on the highway was the most conspicuousitem for miles around . The question annoyed Gretel . " We have not forgotten , Mrs. Moneybags . A squad will be assigned to place them in the ditch until we are ready . " That was a cruel blow ; some of the women gasped and some emitted piteous bleats . Sophie caught Henk 's eye . He cleared his throat . " Neen ! " he called out . Again he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked rapidly to the two in Dutch ; Sophie watched his gestures  --  he seemed to be counting on his fingers , as a demonstration of something . And almost at once Jeroen was making an announcement : for " compassionatereasons , " a group of hostages would be permitted to collect their " hand baggages " and proceed to the house ; the others would finish the work . " How did you pull that off ? " inquired Carey when Henk was back among them . " Yes , how ? " said Sophie . " I said that here are too many persons . For them , it must be dangerous . And most are not needed . " Whenever he had been speaking Dutch , she noticed , his English got worse , as though he were trying to be his own interpreter at some summit meeting  --  he had pronounced " said " as " sayed . " Or was it a sign of strain ? He was certainly a gifted negotiator . It was the first-class passengers who reaped the immediate benefit . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sent off to bed , which was only fair , Sophie thought : most of them were well past fifty . It was a relief to see them set forth , guarded by two Arabs and clutching their cases . " But I 'm fifty , " cried Simmons . " Why should they be privileged ? " " You do n't look it , Aileen , " said Carey . " Let them have their shut-eye . Be good now and stay with us liberals . " " But they 'll eat up all the food , Jim . " Nevertheless , she complied . In a minute she was helping him pick up branches . As it turned out , everyone 's baggage was promptly transported to the house . The steward and stewardess saw to it , and the pilots lent a hand . They did not forget the Bishop 's umbrella or his old carryall  --  his dead wife 's needlework . The squad working on the path smiled as they watched the young pilot gop197past with the treasured possession . " Gus 'll be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister redundantly said . " Did he love her so much ? " asked Simmons . " Or only after she was dead ? " In the moonlight Sophie saw Carey wince . " Cult of relics , " he said , roughly pushing a heap of briars into position . Their labors were almost over . The final chore was to remove all the skid traces from the highway . In Sophie 's opinion , this was overdoing it . The kapers were succumbing to a perfectionist temptation , unless they were plain brutes . And in their place she would have advised water , carried from their hideaway if necessary , rather than a broom . She and Beryl were alone on the empty road . They had relieved the young museum man and the silent Scottish don . The tree had been replanted , the path had been " landscaped " to the limit of possibility , and most of the weary workers had been allowed to go to the house . Only Henk and Jim remained , waiting loyally by the road 's edge and strictly forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . Eventually they would come with their flashlightsto assure themselves that Beryl and Sophie had not shirked . To shirk was certainly tempting , with one broom between them and the skid tracks half frozen in places . They could have used a shovel as a scraper ; instead they had only the feet God had given them . Kicking at a lump of ice , Beryl hurt her big toe . Sophie commiserated , grateful , now , for her boots . Both would greatly like to know how it was that the two of them had been specially elected to perform this senseless last task by themselves . " Why us ? " wondered Beryl . Sophie suspected that it was becausethe gang was punishing her for being Jewish but she decided not to say that ; anyway , it did not explain Beryl . On that point , however , Beryl had her own theory . " Ahmed likes me , " she said . " That 's why . " Suddenly Sophie was bone-tired , too tired , she feared , to be able to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if they were fed , because tomorrow there would be nothing to do but wait . She took the muddy broom from Beryl and gave a ferocious swipe . As she did so , Beryl 's head turned . They heard the sound of a plane 's motor . It was flying low . A searchlightp198was playing over the highway perhaps half a mile off and coming nearer . They saw a flare drop . " Gripes , " said Beryl and ducked . Automatically Sophie let go of her broom ; she crouched . A strange thought crossed her mind . " If it sees us , " the thought said , " we are lost . " She scrambled toward the road 's edge , lookingcrazily for shelter . " Down ! " the man 's voice commanded from somewhere in the underbrush . Clearly he could not see that the order was superfluous . " Down , both of you , " said the woman 's voice . " Into the ditch . " " She loves that ditch , " muttered Beryl . The icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have chosen ; nevertheless they obeyed . Sophie hoped at least that Henk and Jim would be there , too , but they must have been told to hide in the bushes . She was by herself with her one-time classmate , the two of them crouching down , with their feet in the gelid mud . " Does she remind you of Mrs. H. ? " Beryl said , under her breath . " Ssh ! " said Sophie . She had remembered something . The broom . She had left it lying on the road . She asked herself whether Gretel realized that . Maybe she could not see it from where she had taken cover . Sophie straightened up and peered out . The searchlight was still some distance off , making broad sweeping arcs ; she had time . Her heart raced ; her knees shook , as if the plane was " enemy " with a load of bombs to release on her . She crept out . " Get back ! " called the man 's voice . Sophie did not answer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her suede coat no longer mattered  --  till she could touch the tip of the broom-handle ; then she pulled the broom toward her and fell back with it into the ditch . " The broom , " she explained , idiotically . Beryl gripped her filthy hand . " Shake , sister . " All at once , Sophie remembered a funny thing about her at Putney : the time she had told the whole form that she was changing her name to " Aventurine " and expected them all to call her that . Now the plane was directly overhead . Another flare was dropped . Next to her , Sophie could feel Beryl holding her breath . Impossible that the plane would not see them as a motionless pair of shadows in this blinding light . The pilot wasp199making sweeps , yet what interested him seemed to be farther up the road . Did the replanted tree look peculiar ? She remembered reading a background story  --  was it about the Moors murders ?  --  which said that aerial photographs could show where a grave had been dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been carefully replaced . Now even Beryl 's breathingseemed to her too loud ; she could not rid herself of the queer feeling that they could be overheard by the plane . Yet the pilot could not have noticed anything suspicious , for he had turned away from the road , in the direction of the dark house and the barn . It was safe now to peek out . He dipped , and the searchlight prowled . The peaked roofline of the house showed clearly , a quarter of a mile away . Sophie wondered what the hostages inside were feeling . She pictured Harold trying to signal from the roof . But apparently the pilot was satisfied that there was nothing there but " a typical Dutch farmhouse . " In a minute the plane veered back to the highway . It went on , still flying low , toward what must be the mainland . The sound of the motor gradually died away . The scare was over ; bodies popped up , as if resurrecting , and stretched their limbs . Nothing could be heard but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and low human voices , still pitched to an undertone . The flare petered out ; everything returned to normal . Or so to speak . " Teddybye , ' eh ? " said Carey , and no one contradicted . As he took her arm to steady her on the homeward path , Sophie could not help feeling that she had proved quite a heroine in the broom episode  --  courage and initiative under fire . Yet she fought back the urge to mention it , since on the one hand objectively there had been no " fire , " as a sane part of her giddy mind must always have known , and on the other the whole adventure , insofar as it was one , was best kept between herself and " Aventurine . " What would the Bishop think if he heard that singlehandedand without prompting or duress Sophie Weil had foiled a powerful search plane intent on learning their whereabouts ? And that she was unrepentant and unregretful , though she could not say why . He would pray for her maybe.  |p200During  the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at -1  --  Celsius . The sky was empty ; no plane had yet come snooping . From the air , in any case , nothing unusual would be noticed : a typical new farmhouse painted dark green in the Frisian way , its eastern window panes glittering in the rising sun , the sloping roof tiles a shiny fresh orange . Outside the main door swung a clothes-yard on which laundry hung , the only sign of habitation . Fifty meters off , there would appear to be a barn twice the size of the house in construction , loosely roofed over with tar paper or plastic sheeting and lightly blanketed with snow . Beyond , stretching to the horizon and broken only by the gleam of a canal , lay ploughed fields marked by frozen furrows like the deep wrinkles of a weathered Boer face  --  on the ridges the earth color showed through where the wind had swept them bare . Around the house were dainty bird tracks but as yet no human footprints . Later the men would be led out in pairs to pee and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed ; the women would use the downstairs toilet for the time being  --  the toilet permission would be revoked were a breach of discipline to occur . From the air , the house should appear to be occupied but not unduly , not beyond the norm of four to six persons warranted for a settler 's family . On this day in reality it held thirty-two . Eight guards , twentyfourprisoners , which made an acceptable ratio : for every threep201imperialists , one people 's army soldier . In the kitchen the Air France personnel was preparing a morning meal of bread , cheese , cold ham , butter , and coffee . The same meal had been distributed the night before , with the addition of pea soup and herring . If the hostages were to become constipated on this diet , it made no matter : fewer trips under guard to the outdoors and fewer stinking turds deposited . For this reason , prunes had been struck off the list of military supplies required . The logistics of this phase of the operation had been reviewed in depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed over . These people , it must be remembered , were prisoners of war . In engaging an enemy the less left to chance , the greater your flexibility in meeting the challenge of the unexpected under whatever form it might arise  --  " For want of a nail , " as the proverb said . Now , thanks to good planning , on this Tuesday morning , preciselyforty-four hours after the launching of the assault , the innocent-looking farmhouse was an arsenal , stocked to the rafters with arms and ammunition , sandbags , explosives , canned and dried foods , smoked meat and fish , legumes and cereals , dairy products , blood plasma  --  all the materiel needful for a sustained auto-defense . The dwelling stood isolated , in open ground , without neighbors . As yet , no tree or shrub , which might afford cover , screened it from the wind . Any force seeking to approach would be seen immediately , at any rate by daylight . On the side away from the barn ran an entry road visible along its whole length from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the underbrush that might have obstructed a sweeping view had been cleared and stacked in piles . The thicket near the highway on the barn side extended only a few hundred meters of protection . As noted in the initial study , the position had one small drawback , unavoidable in this terrain : the dwelling lacked a cellar , which might have been used for storage and for punishing disciplinary offenders . On the other hand , in the utility room , which occupied the shed , there was a big deep-freeze chest , and the kitchen had a frigidaire , ample shelves and cupboards and old-style bins . Outside the rearp202door were a chicken coop and a rabbit run . The welfare state was kind to its kulaks . This rich farmer 's house boasted eight rooms : on the ground floor , utility room , kitchen , family living-room , and beste kamer , plus a lavatory off the entry hall , containing shower and toilet ; upstairs , the parents ' room , two rooms for the children , playroom , and bathroom with tub and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attic . These boers had a washing-machine , a color television , a floor-waxer , a dish-washer , and central heating , fueled by oil  --  earth gas , the Netherlands ' bragging retort to the Arab oil " boycott , " had not arrived at the polder . The cookstove ran on propane . In addition , these folk had a tractor , fueled by petrol , and a new family automobile  --  a Ford Fiesta  --  as well as bicycles . On Sunday morning , bright and early , the Fiesta had carried the farmer and his butterball wife and four children to Schiphol , with six round-trip tickets ( four half-fare ) to the Balearics for a two weeks ' winter vacation in the sun . Besides the dreck of capitalist technology , the family had a real eiderdown on the matrimonial bed , a child 's crib painted with traditional Hindeloopen designs , and , in the beste kamer , genuine old-time oak-framed samplers embroidered with Old Testament mottoes , an erfstuk Reformed Bible bound in leather , with silver locks , a vase of peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yusuf declared to be genuine and at least fifty years old . The Palestine Liberation Army had been impressed by this farmer 's style of life . That was one of the negative side-effects of the decision to lease a pioneer house on the new polder as a base of operations . The Arab comrades should have been armed by their revolutionary training to resist the crude seductionsof the welfare state . What they saw here , they should know , was window-dressing . The upper peasantry of the " advanced " countries of the West were a privileged caste , the same as the trade unionists , poisoned by the crumbs that fell to them from the rich man 's table . All these social elements were the bribed tools of imperialism , in Marx 's phrase  --  some of the old prophet 's insights were still useful . One had thought that Hus/sein and Ahmed , at least , as " guest workers " in the kitchens and streets and sewers of Paris , would long ago have been demystified . They had seen with their own eyes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HLMs and bidonvilles of Giscard 's police state , alias la belle France . Their social origin was petty bourgeois , but in their political activity as emigrants they had shared the " quality of life " of the sweated underproletariatand did not need to be taught how to hate . Yusuf , by contrast , was a greenhorn , detailed to the present mission from his training camp in Syria ; he was an expert in explosives but still innocent of the inner workings of bourgeois democracy on its home ground . In view of that , it had seemed wiser to withhold him from the first and most dangerous phase of the operation . His physical courage was guaranteed by his Syrian sponsors , but the take-over of an airplane was a more serious affair than raiding a kibbutz or blowing up a hotel . A direct strike at the vital organs of the West called for a more seasoned militant than Yusuf , on arrival , proved to be . After a preliminary screening , in Frankfurt , it had been decided to defer him for service on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself useful and profit from instruction from the other comrades . He had been conducted to a safe house in Aachen , issued a new false passport and identity papers , provided with a haircut , a suit of clothes , and a solid pair of shoes . Three days ago , with the German comrades and Carlos , the Uruguayan , he had crossed the border at Maastricht . The signal from Paris had come . The following noon , Sunday , the operation would begin ; at that time the support elements arriving from Germany should already be in place , with concise directions for preparing the farmhouse to receive the commando and its prisoners , whose number was still unknown . Coordination had been excellent . There had been no difficultyat the border with Yusuf 's papers , and the trunk of the car had not even been opened . Twenty-four hours later , it might have been another story  --  with the capture of the plane a general alert could have gone out . Yet , despite the good functioning of the time-table and the accurate deployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been an error of judgment on the human level , insofar as Yusuf was concerned . Too little was known about him ; his language capacity , in particular , had been overestimated by the Syrian contact  --  the only Western tongue familiar to him was a rudimentary English he had picked up in a Zionist carpet factory . Inspection this morning showed that he had carried out his assignments creditably : the house had been correctly wired , the remaining stocks of explosives stored in a dry place  --  the choice of a flour bin was commendable . But he had no reading skill , and , once his work was completed , time , it seemed , had hung heavy on his hands . This was a restless knabe , Elfride reported , and , like so many of the fedayin , curious , full of questions needing clear answers , which , because of the language handicap , she had been unable to give him , she feared . In the end , he had passed his Sunday silently roaming about the house , doing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour program from a German station on the farmer 's television : Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . On Monday he had counted the piles of starched linen sheets in the housewife 's cupboard and walked over the farmer 's fields . Horst and Carlos had not known what to do with him . With the appearance last night of Ahmed and Hussein , his tongue had loosened . But Ahmed , who had his own weaknesses , was more concerned with his cut thumb  --  wondering whether he should not give himself an injection of blood plasma from the frigidaire  --  than with their comrade 's political education . Like Yusuf , Ahmed and Hussein seemed bewitched by the kulak 's living space and by the signs of wealth they pointed to , eagerly chattering in Arabic . Encouraged by Yusuf and his childlikeexcitement , they had reverted themselves to an infantile level . It became clear that there was an irritating residue of gullibilityin all three comrades . Yusuf had showed them his discovery  --  theshower  --  and they got into it together , giggling and splashing each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Then , having been assigned to the big bed , they climbed under the eiderdown , which they fingered withp205awe , tucking it tenderly under their chins , when a mature politicalreaction , as Greet commented , would have been to slash the old fetish through with a knife and let the feathers fly . The whole disheartening performance was like an advertisement of the benefits of capitalism . Did the sleeping patriots dream of this fat land of milk and honey , where the merry peasant had " never had it so good " ? Jeroen felt discouraged . Seated at the kitchen table , he spat out a morsel of ham onto the paper plate in front of him . Then he sought to be fair . There was a reverence for property here , he realized , that no bourgeois could possibly feel , and it would have to be treated with care or the Arabs could become problems . He was touched by it in a way , remembering himself when he had first come to Amsterdam as an apprentice electricianand looked with wonder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rijksmuseum . It had been a feeling close to worship and had made him ask whether he should not become an artist , dedicate himself to a thing he thought he saw represented here , which he had called to himself " waarde . " This " worth " or value , he imagined , was what the liberation fighters were seeing in the farmer 's housing , which was causing them , still this morning , to open their dark eyes wide , as though they had been given a vision of paradise . An oriental paradise , he thought to himself , shaking his head , and hoped the idea was not racist . A regular Garden of Allah , sumptuously carpeted , for it was the beste kamer , he perceived , that affected them most strongly  --  they would tire of the shower-bath and the washing-machine . Except for the couple 's bedroom , the remainder of the dwelling was more like a " contemporary " suburban villa than an agricultural worker 's home . The manipulative hand of some firm of Amsterdam architects  --  planners for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the new television throned and a stack of religious newspapers seemed to wait for banishment . " Picture " window , rough plaster wall with " sculpture " pattern , false ceiling beams , synthetic-tweed floor covering , indirect lightingpanels  --  Jeroen was sadly familiar with this **27;6269;TOOLONG rommel . He had installed the identical panels and fixtures in city housing developments for workers and could look back on the shame of it as a step in his own development . Here they would name it " polder style , " and where the wild sedges now grew there would be a landscaped house lot , ornamentalshrubbery , a weeping willow , a rock garden , possibly a pool . But the couple had respected the old concept in furnishingthe parlor . Crossing the magic threshold , the three Arabs stared at the housewife 's collection of well-watered plants blooming on window-sill and tables before the shining plate-glass window , at the framed tinted photos of the ancestors , at the harmonium in the corner , at the doilies and antimacassars , at the vase of peacock feathers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real one , that hung on the round window-table and they stepped softly , as if fearful of leaving a footprint , on the thick carpets that lay on the waxed floor . Jeroen had watched their nostrils sensuously take in the characteristic Dutch beste kamer smell , of furniture polish  --  the good old boenwas , guaranteed pure from the hive  --  mixed with the moist hothouse fragrance of flowering plants , with a strong sniff of lye , and a damp , slightly moldy odor of upholstery fabric exuded by a rarely opened room . Yet it was pointless to explain to them , as Greet was doing , that the room was never used except for marriages and will-readings and maybe sometimes the Sabbath . That could only heighten the value of the room in their eyes ; what they sensed here was something sacred . The beste kamer was a religious shrine , a holy of holies , with a ceremonial carpet serving as altar cloth ; the predominant smell of soap and beeswax was the odor of sanctity . If it was used for everyday , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demystify them , it would be necessary to show them what god was being worshipped here and at what cost of blood and grinding toil to their brothers . It was true that such a room occupied valuable space in a house and had no practical utility . But a mosque had no prac/tical utility . And in Jeroen 's view , which differed sharply from Greet 's on this point , a revolutionary should not try to set at naught the experience of something higher , called " transcendence " in philosophy . He did not accept the position , typical of orthodox Leninism , that the philosophers had been sheer ohscurantists ; some of their terms , if reinterpreted and purged of ruling-class overtones , pointed to truths that the revolutionaryshould embrace as his own . There was a potential in man for rising above  --  in other words , transcending  --  gross material concerns that the revolutionary by his act and example sought to bring to full life in every human creature , while the bourgeoisand the bourgeois revisionist sought to strangle it at birth , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The argument of practicality , which Greet was invoking to disabuse the Arabs , could make no impression on them since it was essentially a bourgeois argument . Moreover the childish reverence they showed for this standard Dutch kitsch had to be understood and allowed for in context . It reflected the oppression and deprivation of agricultural workersin their homeland . That such a house should appear to them as a palace told the whole story of imperialist exploitation of the " backward " peoples . To let oneself be impatient with the comrades ' wonderment would be a fault , mirroring one 's own sense of superior social development . Greet despised the beste kamer of her middle-class parents as the ultimate symbol of Dutch hypocrisy ; to profane this farmer 's parlor was seen by her as a revolutionary necessity  --  she was insisting , for instance , that they go back on the promise they had given to water the housewife'sarmy of plants . With all that Jeroen did not sympathize . He had no especially vengeful feelings toward his hard-working parents ' humble best room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the clambering " Busy Lizzies " on the window-sill , industriously flowering without care or nourishment , the lowest of the low among house plants , had been a bright joy of his childhood . To leave this woman 's innocent plants to droop and die as an act of revolutionary justice wouldp208be a kind of slow execution painful to witness and , far from setting the Arabs an example of disciplined class behavior , would only confuse and hurt them . Their development in these matters should be allowed to find its own way without undue prompting or correction . Regarding Ahmed and Hussein , it had been a mistake , plainly , to assume that the lessons learned in Giscard 's France would be seen to apply to the Netherlands ; the West was a hydra , bearing many heads , which had to be struck off separately , even though the trunk of the beast was one and indivisible . The fact was that Den Uyl and his allies were cleverer than their brothers of the Right . They were able to take in the workingclass with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in social measures speaking for themselves and to a certain degree incontestably . A revolutionary would err in saying that there was large-scale poverty in Holland and naked oppression of minorities , that the aged were harshly neglected  --  Jeroen 's own parents , drawing their state pension and health benefits , were living proof of paternalistic " favoritism " to the old . That the pension policy was a ruse to induce early retirement and withdraw a section of the work force from the labor market , thus masking real unemployment , did not alter the facts . The noisy protests of the Right , howling against " confiscatory " taxation and blind to its own interests  --  in reality so well served by Den Uyl and Company  --  helped sustain the fiction . It was only in foreign policy that Den Uyl and his gang regularly gave their game away : was it not openly boasted that staunch little Holland was the " best friend " of Israel and the U.S. imperialist warmakers ? Hand in glove with the imperialists , as their trusted lackey , Den Uyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Chile and the moribund Franco 's Spain . On the domestic scene , the multi-nationals flourished through shameless bribery and corruption , while land-reclamation projects , such as this polder , kept alive the national myth of sturdy self-help . That the CommunistParty had no influence and the only real oppositionp209came from the Right and the fanatic confessional parties demonstratedhow effective the simulation of socialism had been . Even the Indonesians , after a period in unpublicized camps , were consenting to be " absorbed " by their former colonialist masters . Should one blame Arab patriots , born and raised in the teeming bazaars , if they were not wholly immune to the subtle indoctrination of this farmer 's housing ? They were also impressed  --  and for the same reasons , rooted in history  --  by the extent of the farmer 's fields . After walking them yesterday , Yusuf had concluded that they must comprise fifty hectares already ploughed , with about five , including the house lot , still unimproved . He had said to Elfride that the man here must be a big landowner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lying to the masses was always a mistake ; one had to explain and carefully expose the underlying contradictions . Being a German and unfamiliar with Dutch agrarian patterns , she could not say whether this farmer owned the land or rented it from the state , but in the end it came to the same . Narrowly speaking , he was not an exploiter , since it was clear that he used machinery rather than the labor of landless peasants to work it , yet , in a broader sense , as an instrument of imperialism , he was exploiting the resources of the Third World , in his very tractor and the diesel that fueled it , the rubber tires of his automobile , the copper-derived chromium of his wife 's appliances , the nitrates of his fertilizer , and so on . On the other hand , it would be stupid to pretend that he and his wife , by Dutch standards , enjoyed great prosperity ; there was too much evidence here to the contrary , though some of it might not be visible to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably misplaced . In terms of the Dutch class structure , these were not moneyed people . The new furniture consisted of " suites " purchased no doubt at a discount house ; there were no books , and the only picture was a cheap reproductionof a Rembrandt self-portrait tacked up in the children 's playroom . Very likely the man was still paying out to the usurers of the loan companies on the car and the tractor . Hisp210wife made her own and the children 's clothes , as an old Singer in the couple 's room testified . But in Yusuf 's eyes , a sewingmachinewas a sign of affluence  --  another contradiction springingfrom historical unevenness . The clearest proof , however , that this family 's circumstances were relatively modest was the way they had jumped at the offer to vacate the premises for a two-week period . It had perhapsnot even been necessary to throw in the vacation in the Balearics . Probably they would have been glad to move in with relatives on the mainland  --  the woman had her people in Kampen . So Jeroen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had argued that the cost factor must be weighed against the temptation the couple might feel to " look in " on their tenants  --  sometrivial pretext could always be found . She did not trust the woman ; to her mind , it was worth a thousand guilders for the group to have the assurance that the creature was out of Holland , safely lying on a beach and coated with sunburn lotion , during the crucial first phase of the operation . Doubtless she had been right ; Jeroen knew it was inconsistent for a revolutionaryto have , like him , a penny-pinching mentality inherited from peasant forebears of the deepest " black-stockings " dye . Besides , Greet had to be deferred to for the remarkable vision she had shown in proposing the polder as a base . From the start they had all seen that for a strike of this magnitude a fall-back position would have to be prepared , since the usual ports of call , though sometimes curiously open to commercial hijackers , could not be counted on to receive a people 's army commando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sad results of factional division within the **39;6298;TOOLONG . That among the people 's prisoners an Americansenator would figure made it all the more likely that a " diplomatic " attitude could be expected from the Arab capitals , to say nothing of Havana , where this senator was regarded , simplistically , as some kind of friend . Hence it had been essentialto develop a serious alternative , not dependent on the whims and opportunistic calculations of national leaders , andp211it was Greet , at the December meeting , who had had the genius to think of the polder . Like every creative idea , it had got a lukewarm reception to begin with ; all sorts of " practical " objections were raised , particularly by the German comrades . But then Jeroen himself had caught fire , and , before the meetingwas over , the whole planning council was converted . After that , a familiar law of momentum took over : the more the comrades studied the polder , the less interest they showed in the original list of sanctuaries which were to be tried before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute . By a swift overturn , comparable to a revolution , almost overnight and yet without anyone 's conscious decision , the last became first . When finally , after cautious reconnoitering and consultation of a geodetic map , this particular farmhouse had been pinpointed as most suited to their purpose , it was as if they could no longer , willingly , reverse direction , any more than a snowball rolling downhill could change course . This , at any rate , was Jeroen 's analysis of the phenomenon as he looked back from today 's perspective on the stages , unrolling as in a slow-motion film , from doubt to total commitment the plan had traversed . From here , like any process when looked at backward , it appeared foreordained , never to have been in doubt . Yet at the final meeting in Paris , on the eve of the great day , it had still been voted that on take-over the pilot would query the " sympathizing " Arab capitals for permission to land . But more as a matter of form  --  if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherly concession to the Syrian arms-suppliers than in any serious expectation of a favorable response . Jeroen did not like to think , now , what his reaction would have been if an Arab capital had surprised them . Bitter regret , surely , for the time and work and study that had gone into the polder alternative  --  not to mention the air fares and the rent money and the Majorca hotel outlay  --  but , beyond that , for Jeroen and perhaps for Greet too , there would have been almost an artistic disappointment . Already , while it was still a blueprint , they were proud of their idea , of its simple clean lines and undeniable originality  --  it owed nothing in its conception to any of the current models of revolutionary strategy . The Japanese Red Army comrades , Wadi Haddad and his PFLP contingent , even the matchless " Carlos " could only admire . And in the captive Boeing , Jeroen had needed all his schooling in indifference to keep an impassiveface as they monitored the radio for answers which were strangely slow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polder , if all had gone well , the farmhouse stood ready and waiting . To sit dully , by contrast , in the Libyan desert , while Khaddafi 's people bargained for you would have been a sorry comedown ; in fact such a prospect had become unthinkable to Jeroen , and not merely because the most predictableoutcome would be " administrative detention " in a Benghazi jail . Working out the details  --  the bothersome minutiae , each of which required a separate inspiration to resolve  --  he had fallen in love with the plan . He had watched it grow under their hands , change and develop , meet and encompass obstacles or else leap over them . The sense of it as a work of art had grown in him , and not a solitary work of art fashioned by a bourgeois dreamer out of lifeless materials but an active , vital collaborationin which even the farmer and his wife and red-cheeked children played a part , albeit an unwitting one . They were the local materials to be worked in , as your architect used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also the " local color , " the oud-Hollands camouflage serving as your disguise . And insofar as they were a part of the medium you worked in , the resistance they offered to your design had to be calculated and incorporated as an element in the overall picture . In short , they were a challenge , and here again it was Greet who had responded creatively . The problem presented was simple , and yet everything hung on it : how to approach these people with an offer to " borrow " their property that would not excite their suspicions . Suspicion was inbred in farm-dwellers  --  a reflex set in motion by any novelty , by the mere sight of a stranger . Yet to take over the house by force was an option ruled out by the circumstances ;  |p213violence  applied prematurely would abort the whole design . Some stratagem was needed that would disarm the pair as effectivelyas a weapon and yet have an innocent , indeed attractive appearance . Something familiar to them in their everyday life , something they would welcome as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ; the sight of money in quantity would be too unfamiliar . To find an " open sesame " was not so easy ; the others were almost ready to give up and look for another stronghold when Greet hit on the answer : television , of course . They would pose as a television crew doing a story on the polder . No one doubted that this at last was the solution  --  an answer so obvious that it might have been overlooked , like the televisionaerial on the roof of the dwelling over which the eye passed without taking notice , any more than of a chimney . And the event had proved her right , as if it had been programmed : the knock on the door , footsteps inside , a pair of blue eyes peering out the window , cautious unbolting of the door , inspectionof the four persons standing outside , carrying cameras and sound equipment , quick glance at the small truck parked in the entry road with large stickers " Hamburger Rundfunk " on its sides and rear , removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please , ladies and gentlemen , but kindly wipe your feet . " Then , after the inevitable service of coffee , the housewifewas ready to hear their proposition . The truck and the stickers on it must have dispelled any lingering doubt . The stickers had been Horst 's idea . Strange how , from the instant that impersonating a television crew was thought of , the details had fallen into place , like iron filings assembling around a powerful magnet . Improvements and minor corrections seemed to derive naturally from the key concept , as if it had a brain of its own . Jeroen , at the beginning , had thought of hand-lettering the trunk with the name of the German station , but Horst had showed him the risk in that if they should happen to be stopped by the highway police  --  stickers , which could be removed immediately on leaving the farmhouse , served the same purpose and would not be seenp214to be stickers unless examined close up . Similarly , the original scenario had had them coming from the Omroepstichting . But Jeroen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy for the couple to check up with the Dutch feature service ; a simple phone call would do it . German television combined the known and the remote . It was watched regularly in Holland , yet to place a call to Hamburg to check up on a polder documentary would be beyond these people . In addition , " Hamburger Rundfunk " had the virtue of explaining the German comrades : Horst was posing as the sound-man , with Elfride as his script girl . Jeroen was the camera-man , and Greet his lighting assistant and the crew 's interpreter . The dark-skinned Yusuf and Carlos would not be seen during the negotiations ; they would appear later , when the family 's departure from Schiphol had been confirmedby the comrade at the KLM desk . It had been wonderful how the couple had swallowed the story . " Dummkopfer ! " said Horst . Yet should one sneer at them for credulousness , considering the inducements to belief furnished by the stickers , the Hamburg license-plate , the paraphernaliaof sound-equipment , cameras , cables , blackboard , tripod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " crew " ? Hundreds of feet of simulated film were turned , showing the husband seated on the tractor , the wife feeding the chickens , the children at play , and so on . An interview with the couple on polder conditions was taped  --  a genuine one , by good luck , since the woman 's final request , when the team was already packing up , was to hear her voice played back . They had raised fewer objections than had been anticipated in the preparatory study . The man 's main concern was that he should be back in time for his spring sowing , which , given the state of the ground , could be as late as February , and he agreed , though with slight hesitation , that work on the barn should be halted when the keys were turned over  --  too noisy and disruptivefor the crew while it was filming . He might have asked why the Germans had chosen the dead season of the year for doing a documentary on polder life  --  " scheduling " was the only answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionp215seemed not to have occurred to him , and the woman 's questions had to do with the sleeping arrangements  --  were the two couples married ?  --  with the oil and electricity bills and potential damage to the furnishings  --  who would pay ? A generous deposit , to cover , also , wear and tear on towels and bed linen , had sufficed to quiet her . Her only demur arose over the contract , made out in duplicateon paper bearing the letterhead of the Hamburg station , which Jeroen put in her hands , pleased to have remembered this crowning small touch of verisimilitude . She did not want it , and her man , meeting her eyes , had concurred . For a moment , Jeroen had been dumbfounded . Then he understood : taxes . Obviously the couple preferred to have the deal take place under the table , with nothing on paper to show income received . Putting the contract back in his pocket , he had nearly laughed for joy . This solved the last problem confronting the commando : how to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin and neighbors that her house had been chosen by a German network for a documentary on the polder , the place would be surrounded by curiosity-seekers . Even the resourceful Greet had been unable to think of a means , stronger than mere persuasion , of guaranteeing the creature 's silence . A reward to be placed in the couple 's hands on their return if the crew had been allowed to film undisturbed by neighbors or relatives ? But the promise of a reward for silence might sow a germ of doubt : respectable people , the pair might well reflect , did not pay to have no witnesses to their doings . In the group 's thinking , that bridge had been still uncrossed when they had arrived at the house that first morning ; they were waiting on inspiration . Then the woman 's gesture , totally unexpected , of pushing back the contract , did their work for them . There could be no better insurance that the affair would remain quiet than that the couple had their own motive for concealment : cheating the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central concept : the raw materials of bourgeois life , of their own initiative , sprang forward to collaborate in a revolutionary design aimed at its destruction . Moreover itp216showed  --  to descend to the particular  --  how erroneous it would have been to pretend to come from Dutch television : revenue from Omroepstichting would be automatically reported to The Hague ; no motive , then , for silence . Looking back on that series of lucky chances , or narrow escapes , Jeroen felt confirmed in his persistent sense of being guided in this enterprise by an unseen power that fitted everything together , like Hegel 's " cunningof reason " or Adam Smith 's " invisible hand . " He did not yet know the name of this power that was directing him but every now and again he felt its gentle pressure . What had prompted him , for example , to draw up a contract that had seemed at the time a mere touch of artistry , a perhaps wasteful embellishment ? And the labor of printing the letterhead had been , in one sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that , how else could the group have learned that it had no cause for worry in the woman 's wagging tongue ? It was as if every " artistic " stroke had responded to a logic in the decayingcapitalist structure . When a spearhead of revolutionaries brought a plan of subversion to bear on a bourgeois entity , that inner logic , uncannily , started to apply of itself , without priming . Nevertheless , on Sunday afternoon , while Yusuf was watchingSchneeweiss and die Sieben Zwerge on the Kinderprogramm in the living-room and Carlos was napping , Elfride and Horst had passed an anxious hour or so at the kitchen window , alert to the danger represented by the woman 's parents in Kampen , only half an hour 's drive away . Who knew , after all , what story the daughter had told them ? And if the old people were to turn up on an after-church ride with a bee in their bonnet of " keeping an eye on " the property , their failing eyesight could hardly miss the redoubt of sandbags that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the farmer 's potato sacks . But the Sabbath afternoon had gone by without a sign of an interloper . Jeroen , had he thought of it , could have put the comrades ' minds at rest . From all the signs , as Elfride , a pastor 's daughter , might have noted herself , these people werep217strict Calvinists , and their parents would be stricter . A born Lutheran from Hesse maybe would not know , but Dutch Calvinistsof that persuasion did not joy-ride on Sunday or visit back and forth . In fact , the man of the house , though Elfride and Horst were unaware of the episode , had entered his first objection on learning that they were to fly on the Sunday morning . Jeroen ought to have foreseen that . When poor Greet , all unsuspecting , came by with the tickets and the hotel vouchers , it had been too late to change . Everything depended on adherenceto the schedule , which had the family 's departure from Schiphol synchronizing with the Boeing 's departure from De Gaulle and following , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Maastricht by the German-led detail . The man 's sudden balking , at that juncture , could have been a real disaster . Luckily , he had allowed Greet and his disappointed family to persuade him to overlook , for once , the observance of the Sabbath : the fault would not be his but Hamburg 's for setting an inflexible date . And on the way to the airport , as the woman pointed out , they could get the Gereformeerd service on the car radio . Aside from this conscientious obstacle  --  the ultimate close shave  --  the family had given no real problems . Early Sunday morning , Elfride and Horst had arrived at the farmhouse in the by-now-familiar truck , explaining that the Dutch crew would follow : they had been held up in Amsterdam by trouble with one of the cameras ; probably the family would cross them on the road . The woman , at Greet 's suggestion , had prepared a list of instructions as to the watering of the plants , the regulationof the thermostat , disposal of the garbage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man was worrying about parking it at the airport in a place where it would not be stolen  --  " too many lawless elements these days , " he told Horst in broken German . Then came the transfer of the keys , and for an instant Elfride thought she saw a shade of doubt in the woman 's eyes ; clearly she would rather have Greet , who spoke her language , to entrust them to  --  that would be almost like " inp218the family . " The man told her to hurry . Outside , the children , restless and eager to leave , were examining the truck . The older boy was pulling at one of the stickers . He called out something in Dutch . " Look , moeder , it comes off ! " was what he was saying , plainly . He held up the sticker in his grubby little hand . Elfride caught her breath . She was sure she saw a funny , thoughtful expression come over the woman 's face . But Horst was really a wonder . " Ja , ja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in German , with a hearty laugh . " Now let 's put it back , shall we ? " Seeing his good humor , the woman scolded the child . " Genoeg ! " she said  --  " That 's enough . " Then , to Horst , " Excuse it . " Whatevershe may have asked herself for a fleeting second , the importance of the stickers had not sunk into her mind . The Fiesta drove off , with the children waving from the rear window . In a few minutes , the back-up car waiting with Yusuf and Carlos was able to emerge from a side road off the highway . Supplies and the short-wave radio were swiftly transferred to the house . Werner , the driver , would head straight for the German border . The truck , stolen in Rotterdam , with the false Hamburg license-plate and altered serial number , had no further part to play ; eventually it would be found by the police in the parking lot at Schiphol , where the young comrade assigned to fetch it had been instructed to abandon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Jeroen sat at the kitchen table before the short-wave set , holding an earphone to his right ear  --  the hearing of the left had been impaired by a beating he had got in a " Red Youth " demonstration in The Hague . The breakfast service was finished . The Air France people had washed up the coffee-pot and cleared off the paper plates and cups , which would be burned in the outdoor incinerator when the right moment came . He was alone . The kitchen had been declared out of bounds except to the Air France cabin crew and the two Dutch pilots . It had been decided to treat them as neutrals ; they were working folk , with the usual pay grievances , and so , in principle , capable of being radicalized  --  Greet herself was a former KLM hostess , won to the just cause during a siege onp219the Cairo air-strip . In any case , their services were needed for the preparation and issue of food . Jeroen had elected to make the kitchen their command post because of its size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy it offered during most of the day ; it had sliding doors , which could be closed , as now , when important business was being transacted . Moreover , it pleased him to sit in a kitchen . Werner 's voice was coming through , clearly now , from Aachen . Still no news . Irritably , Jeroen put down the earphone and pushed the big set aside : he did not need to be reminded of the time difference ; he knew quite well that it was only four in the morning in New York . Of course it was too early to expect a full report on the list of eleven parasites that Aachen had relayed to the comrades there ; obviously museums and galleries would not open till ten , which would be four in the afternoon here . But there were other sources ; newspapers stayed open all night . The names he and Greet had hurried last night to copy from the first-class passports must be on file in any newspaper " morgue . " In that metropolis , surely , there were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , with links to the movement who could be waked up for consultation . Some relevant information , however incomplete , should have reached the cell in Aachen by this time ; the details could be filled in when the museums and art libraries opened . But the names " Ramsbotham , " " Tallboys , " " Potter , " " Chadwick , " et cetera  --  with home cities added to avoid the possibility of confusion  --  had produced from New York , so far , only such banalities as " millionaire sportsman , " " fat cat , " " self-styled philanthropist , " " extreme right-winger . " Not a word suggestive of art patronage , to the point where Jeroen was beginning to wonder whether he and Greet had not made a mistake . Had they been too impulsive in departing , on their own initiative , from the agreed-on plan calling for the release of all first-class passengers ? When they had got wind of a tour of collectors aboard the Boeing , it had seemed , at least to Jeroen , a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked himself if he and Greet had not over-reacted when she had hurried for/ward bringing word of " Giorgiones and Titians " belonging to a tour of millionaires traveling in first class : she had heard the little liberal woman say so . But that woman was an exaggerator , as they had since observed . Perhaps these people were not art collectors at all but just ordinary rich people who " owned " a painting or two . To have seized a group of ordinary rich people , even millionaires , held no interest for Jeroen . Money , though it would have to figure on the list of demands , was the least of the commando'sobjectives . Furthermore , extorting ransom from a handful of plutocrats would fatally shift the emphasis : a jugular strike based on principle and aimed dramatically at the " superstructure , " in Marxian terms , of Western capitalism would take on the appearance of another pinprick hardly distinguishable from run-of-the-mill criminality . Millionaires could pay " a king 's ransom " and barely feel it , just as your rich bourgeois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike the poor man  --  there was plenty more where it came from . To deal a blow at this society , it was necessary to take from it something it deemed irreplaceable . That , at any rate , had been the concept behind the capture of the Boeing , known to be carrying an international committee of liberal cat 's paws of the energy interests to investigate torture in Iran . The other passengers were of no concern  --  bystanders or civilians , to be sent about their business as rapidly as possible . " Excess baggage , " as Horst had formulated it ; for the coup to make its point , the committee must be seen to be the exclusive target . Seizing this body of self-appointed just men on an errand of mercy to the Third World struck at the core of the West 's pious notion of itself . And to strike not at random but selectively , choosing showcase models of civic virtue whose price was above rubies and whom the West would have to save at any cost or renounce its image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrilege . Without sacrilege , as history showed , there could be no terror worthy of the name . And the fact that these good souls were journeying on a patently selfless mission , in Economy class as befitted their social outlook , could be counted on to add top221the horror and condemnation the deed would call forth . A reactionof universal shock and outrage was essential to the success of the design . There would have been nothing like it since the Olympic Games " massacre , " and those were only athletes . To the people 's ear , the chorus of indignation would have a comic sound , for the West , in fact , set no value on concerned and high-minded citizens except when they could be used to further some purpose of its own . Had this committee perished in a plane crash , Washington , ordering a day of remembrance , would have been relieved , on the whole , to be rid of them , since its anti-Soviet interest required a simulation of friendship with the Shah , despite pressures from business elements hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tougher line with him  --  this conflict of interests , out of which such a committee of innocents would tend to be born , was a typical contradiction of late capitalism . Yet a pretense of valuing its critics was still essential to the system in its present stage , and the price of maintaining the pretense in this case was going to be rather high . To save these sacred skins , the horrified West would have to accept an exchange : for every just man , four people 's army militants , to be released from the imperialists ' jails . Having calculated the ratio with an eye to due measure , Jeroen had not believed that they should ask more . To ask more might decide the imperialists to refuse any concessions , on the ground that terror , knowing no bounds , could be met only with firmness . For the commando , there would then be nothing for it but to execute the prisoners . In the new circumstances , however , that thinking was no longer viable . It had been natural to postulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly for the German comrades , who had had Andreas and Ulrike in mind and Gudrun and Jan-Carl and the other Werner and Irmgaard . . . . But that goal , they would have to see , was no longer within reach of the commando . Study of the passports proved that , contrary to earlier and supposedly " sure " information , the venerable prelate from Koln was not among the prisoners  --  Greetand Jeroen , in the Boeing , had already thoughtp222as much  --  hence , Bonn could sit back and smile at the fantasy of such a demand . Similarly , an American rabbi and Israeli stooge " guaranteed " to be with this committee was nowhere in evidence , so that the Zionist state could smile , too , at any ultimatum calling for the freeing of the Arab brothers it held . Bad luck for the Palestinian army , but it would have to be accepted . The whole position would have to be re-thought , in view of the current actuality , and larger demands conceived . It was a challenge to the imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a body-for-bodies exchange was too often unproductive , leading to killing for want of a better result . The enemy by his attitude , rather than proletarian justice , dictated your disposal of the prisoners . In any case , killing was not a choice Jeroen cared to make except as a last resort . Killing the cat had been a botch , offensiveto his workman 's instinct ; he had felt momentary pleasure in the act of taking aim , but using the poor creature to set an example to the passengers had surely been unnecessary . He blamed his nerves , which had been on edge as the pilot kept circling over Schiphol and it had begun to look as if they could not land . Killing accomplished little and with forethought could usually be avoided . As for torture , that was not envisioned . Elfride had been eager to give these liberals a taste of the conditions of detention suffered by comrades in the imperialists ' jails . But solitary confinement , as at Stammheim , in a windowlessbox with a judas-hole and a blinding overhead light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters which had not been designed as a prison . Perfect reciprocity  --  an eye for an eye  --  was an ideal that the revolutionarywith his inferior means could not hope to achieve . Furthermore , the age of most of the hostages and their soft habits of life would make simple detention , with the inevitable crowding and inadequate toilet facilities , a species of harsh punishment that in their case suited the crime . " Torture " in fact was the word they were already using to describe having had to sleep without blankets or mattress " like sardines in a can , " one lot on the floor of the family living/room and the rest in the unfinished attic  --  those who had passed the night in the living-room objected to the bad air and those who had been sent to the attic protested the lack of heating . Posted with his rifle at the head of the stairway , Carlos had had to hear their grumblings and their intermittent snores . And now Greet reported that a petition was about to be presented by the pastor asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be allowed to sleep in the helicopter ; in the family room they were still disputing over the wording . Jeroen could have told them that they were wasting their breath . It was a rule of guerrilla operations never to disperse your hostages . In the original plan , of course , excessive crowding had not been foreseen . The addition of twelve from first class to the nucleus of eight liberals was responsible . Yet if these people proved to be important collectors of art , then the difficulties of housekeeping and management created by their numbers would seem slight in comparison to the matchless opportunity their uninteresting bodies represented . If their collections were to contain a single Titian or Giorgione , their presence in the chosen plane constituted a windfall that Jeroen in his wildest dreams would hardly have dared to conceive . Back in the Boeing , having brought him the incredible news , Greet , woman-like , had cooled in the face of his enthusiasm . All at once , she professed not to see the difference between a collector of paintings and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think they are better , pray ? " " Not they in themselves , " he had answered . " What they have is better . Better than cars or yachts or securities . ' Maybe not in our eyes but in the eyes of their society . " " In your eyes , Jeroen , " Greet had retorted . " I do not like to see you so excited . " And in a moment she had added " I think I am sorry I told you . " Faced with that wilful blindness , he had had to make her understand the uniqueness of the opportunity : finding this tour aboard put them within striking distance of dozens , perhaps hundreds , of priceless works of art . How they would manage to get hold of a few of those treasures was not yet clear to him . He would have to think , he had told her . But once they had managed it ,  |p224no  demand would be too bold . This society had two talismans : one moral and therefore hypocritical , honored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily practice and most highly venerated in the form of works of art . In the interior of the Boeing , by one chance in a million , the pair coexisted , even if for the moment the art works were present only nominally , at a second remove . Such a chance would never arise again ; if they let the collectors go , they would renounce a prize that would not be offered them twice . If they kept them , they ran no extra risk . In the end , his arguments had persuaded her . The polder house , he had showed her , was one incentive the more , almost dictating their action to them . When again would they possess a stronghold with ample storage facilities , completely isolated and yet accessible by helicopter ? It would not even be necessary for the helicopters bringing the canvases to land ; their cargo could be dropped in the open field . In the event that large canvases were delivered  --  statuary , unless small , should not be attempted  --  the barn roof could be finished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeroen sighed . Thinking backward , to the great moment of decision in the Boeing , his mind was leaping too far ahead . Doggedly , he pulled the set to him and tried the Aachen frequency . Only static . Yet he could not make a serious plan until he knew what the collections , if in fact they existed , consisted of . There was no point in interrogating the prisoners , as Carlos had proposed : they would lie . And if there were no important works of art in the collections , it was hardly worth the effort . Better to get rid of the whole tour , though he could not think how . He would not accept dubious attributions or " school " or " follower " works . And no American stuff . His heart was set on the masters . He wanted Rubens , Rembrandt , Goya , Vermeer , as well as the Titians and Giorgiones , which may have been only a figure of speech . With American buying power in mind , he had been choosing , letting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have gone back to your old love , Jeroen , "  |p225Greet  had reproached him on the plane . Now she slid open the door and , seeing him with the radio , she said it again . " Back to your first love . Be careful , Jeroen . " The accusation was partly true . In his young days in Amsterdam , when the word " waarde " had sounded in his brain , it had not once occurred to him to work to become rich so that he could own a fine canal house with pictures in it . His idea had been to consecrate himself , in poverty like a monk , to the value people called " art " by learning , if possible , to make some of it himself . As though to pay back a debt he owed for the joy his eyes were experiencing in the museums and along the canals . For a time he tried to teach himself by sketching in the Rijksmuseumand eventually also in the Stedelijkmuseum  --  he still loved Van Gogh as a person and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then he became interested in his trade union and began to give his evenings to union meetings and slowly he grew disillusioned with art . Next , moving steadily leftward , by a process that now seemed to him logical and as natural as the growth process in an organism , he joined the Party . There he got his only higher education  --  his parents had put him to work at the legal school-quitting age of sixteen . In the Party , too , he had learned to make prints and to letter ; they paid for his going to classes and used his crude work in posters and handbills and sometimes in De Waarheid , their paper . He knew it was crude and was proud of that , for now the sole value he saw in art was that of transmitting messages . to the people to incite them to action  --  at election times he painted wooden placards to be placed on the bridges urging the masses to vote for the C.P.N. He hated " art for art 's sake , " though he accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wasteful indulgence could finally be afforded . Then he became disillusionedwith the Party and turned sharply against it . He saw that he had let himself be deceived : it was merely another part of the system of world-wide oppression  --  openly as in the Soviet Union or covertly as in Holland , where it served as a willing safety valve for the masses ' discontent . He was ashamed ofp226having had his work in De Waarheid , which did not tell the Truth , as its name pretended , but just a different set of lies . When he broke , he passed almost overnight to direct action . He became what was called a terrorist . Now art , even the Party kind of making propaganda , lost all interest for him , except in the sense that a deed was a work of art  --  the only true one , he had become convinced . The deed , unless botched , was totally expressive ; ends and means coincided . Unlike the Party 's " art as a weapon , " it was pure , its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose served by the capture of the Boeing was simply the continuance or asseveration of the original thrust ; ransom money , the release of fellow-actionists , were not goals in which one came to rest but means of ensuring repetition . Direct action had a perfect circular motion ; it aimed at its own autonomous perpetuation and sovereignty . And the circle , as all students of drawing knew , was the most beautiful of forms . Thus in a sense he had returned to where he had started : terrorism was art for art 's sake in the political realm . Some in the movement believed that their action would give rise to a new society , but this belief was an impurity . Jeroen was not even sure that the construction of a just society ought to concerna revolutionary ; that dream had been dreamed too often . He thought Trotsky was right in his notion of the permanent revolution , right but insincere  --  in his day of power his ruthless repression of the sailors of Kronstadt had exposed his real attitude . Revolution , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eternal spinning , the opposite of evolution , so attractive to the bourgeois soul . For the true revolutionary , the only point of rest lay in the stillness at the center of the circle , just as a wheel rapidly turning on its axis gave the appearance of arrested motion . Such ideas were deeply troubling to Greet . She did not like to hear him state that the struggles of the Palestinian people were merely a parenthesis , to be closed without regret when they had served their purpose  --  " Your theories again . " She was jealous of his brain , which she regarded as an untrustworthyp227organ capable of leading him away from her and the others it-to a foreign sphere . As she sat across the table somberly gazing . -t him , he could read her mind . She was fearing that his interest in the group of collectors was a sign of softening or backsliding , that he would let himself be diverted by his old passion from the main end . There she was wrong . His " artistic " interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheer beauty of the coup he envisioned . He had seen that they could be transmuted ; it only needed the Midas touch of exchanging them against their masterpieces to turn their base substance intopure gold . The method of persuasion remained to be studied  --  whatever was best calculated to convince the collectors to accept the principle of paying their ransom " in kind . " He foresaw a two-way airlift : crates of art descending , the " owners " ascending , to be shipped back home or to Teheran according to their mood . The transfer would put an end to the crowding and , far more interesting , it would render the farmhouse impregnable . Once the house contained irreplaceable masterpieces , any notion of taking it by storm would have to be abandoned by the imperialistsunless they wished to pass for " barbarians " before the eyes of their entire " civilized " world . At that point , the commando could dictate its own terms and at its own good leisure ; there would be no hurry . Yet in the immediate time was pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disguise of the polder house was penetrated . The short-wave radio , indispensable as it was at this stage , was also a danger that had to be reckoned with . If the enemy were to pick up the " pirate " transmissions , the unlicensedfrequencies could of course be spotted , and the authoritiesat both ends , having mapped the bearings , would swiftly close in . Here on the polder , the hostages were a safeguard , precluding an instant swoop , but the comrades in Aachen risked being surprised with their mobile transmitter by a cordon of police . Each transmission was increasing the likelihoodof detection . The remedy was to shift to another set of frequencies , but there was a limit to how long that game couldp228be played . Out of regard for the Aachen comrades , communicationsshould be discontinued at the earliest possible moment . Yet to break off contact while New York was still to be heard from would constitute a defeat , and the Aachen cell , so far , agreed . For a while longer , Werner would keep trying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by agreement , every third hour . The best hope was that the possibility of clandestine transmissions to and from the " criminal band " would be slow to occur to the authorities . And up to now there had been no discernible attempt at jamming  --  the usual warning sign . Yet unfortunately the absence of interferencecould read in two opposite senses . There was nothing to do but stupidly wait . The fact that this morning no plane had yet come prowling overhead was at least a reassurance . The fools might be off on another track . Every hour the radio announced that an " energetic " hunt for the missing helicopter was in progress but gave no particulars . The evening news on television was bound to be fuller , if only in order to pander to the public 's craving for thrills ; they might even be shown the " dragnet " of search planes and police with walkie-talkies , or would it be merely interviews with the Defenseand Justice ministers and the families of the hostages ? Belgian and German radio reported a " security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of seeing a newspaper . As the hours passed , Jeroen grew unwontedly restless . To be marooned here with no news except that doled out by official sources was an experience he had not pictured in his planning . He felt cut off , left out of events and decisions that nevertheless should concern him as a prime actor  --  hardly , in that respect , in a better position than the hostages , who must be guessing and speculating too . The final ridiculous touch was to discover this morning that the farm couple had had their telephone service suspended : the farmer had indicated to Horst that there was a coin box down the highway in case the crew needed to place long-distancecalls . That was of no significance , so long as they had the radio , but the sight of the dead instrument on the kitchenp229counter was a sour reminder of the meanness and mistrust in the bourgeois nature , preparing petty frustrations for the foreignerin return for his generosity  --  what if the " crew " from Hamburg had urgently needed a doctor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comrades here were showing a certain reserve toward his plans for the collectors . He could count on Greet ; she was loyal , in spite of her cavils . And in fairness he could not expect Horst and Elfride and Carlos to immediately share his enthusiasm ; not having been on the Boeing , they had learned only last night of the abrupt revision of the program that had raised the numberof hostages from eight to twenty . As for the Arabs , they had not yet had the collectors explained to them  --  there would be time enough for that when New York had pronounced  --  and had not been moved to ask ; for them , the evidence that these additional people were rich was doubtless sufficient reason for their being here . It was depressing , though , that Werner , on being told late last night by radio of the unforeseen development , had responded almost with ecstasy ( " Wunderbar , nicht ? Unglaublich ! " ) , while those here on the spot had had only neutral comments , as if to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time had gone by . It must be the waiting and watching him fiddle uselessly with the radio . Werner , in freedom , had the active part , telephoning New York , and on his own initiative making roundabout inquiriesof a famous Aachen collector , who , however , knew only hyper-realism , post-op , post-pop , earth art , and the Americans who collected such rommel . Here the comrades were condemned to unemployment ; they had nothing to do but eat and stand guard and rebuff the hostages ' incessant demands for news . Inactivity was the problem . From being masters of the situation , they were slipping into a state of dependency and powerlessnessin respect to the outside world . The moment they got the information , good tidings or bad , it would be necessary , Jeroen decided , for the commando to assert itself and abandon this cat-and-mouse game . There could be no further need for hiding and waiting , maiden-like , to be found . An announce/ment from the command post would declare its location  --  why not ? A flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Makingone on the Singer from the housewife 's scraps of dressmakingmaterial would give the hostages something to do . Some of the present precautions could be relaxed . There was no reason that the prisoners should not be permitted to go for short walks around the house , twice a day , under guard . For aerial reconnaissance to observe them at their exercise could do no harm . Jeroen did not agree that the headquarters should be regarded as a punitive re-education center  --  Elfride 's idea , typicallyGerman . Contrary to what she said , it was not his intention to coddle the hostages , but last night 's experience showed that given favorable conditions even the most unpromising human material was capable of cooperation . The evening meal was being distributed when Aachen finally signaled that it was ready to transmit . Horst was monitoring the set , and the stewardess came running to bring Jeroen from the family room , where he stood looking at television . They were showing Royal Navy dredges dragging the Ijsselmeer for the helicopter  --  good entertainment ; a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapping . From the shadows on the screen , the time would appear to have been early afternoon , now several hours in the past . Just before dark , doubtless at the close of that costly and fruitless operation , a plane had circled over the farmhouse and disappeared into the sunset ; the hostages had watched it through the pastor 's binoculars . Now the house stood in darkness , except for the family room , lit by the television and a single lamp , the playroom upstairs , where the farm children would be doing their homework , the stairway , and the kitchen . Jeroen seated himself at the table , fitted the gray rubber earphones on his head , took the pencil Horst was holding out to him , and prepared to write . The message was coming through clearly . The code they had settled on was simple , more like a shorthand used by children in a family to communicate among themselves when elders were listening than like the usual ciphers , which were child 's play for the experts to " break . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your prognosis justified . Grandma Potter much better than was first thought . Dr. Van der Meer from Delft in constant attendance , also Dr. Tiziano but the one they call Big George unavailable for consultation . Sheer bosh that she can not recover . Uncle Widderhintere 's condition complicated by history of sporting activity . Keeps Duffy at bedside , also British specialists highly regarded in field , such as Stubbs , Ward , Marshall . The Gas fellow drops in from race track to see patient but Uncle Widder unwilling receive Ed 's dancers in home . Since husband 's decease , Cousin Margaret has mild religious mania , much attached to the Greek , sees visions in sepia of archangels but enjoys more colorful commerce with angelic monk and Italian primitive types , including older monk called Laurence . " The next was unintelligible , then " Chadwick , sagt Anna , hat 8 grosser kinder . . . . With a sudden motion , Horst turned the radio off ; he had heard a plane 's motor . They listened . Out the window they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yawned . Let them come . He had heard all he needed . With the pencil he beat time to the beam of light dancing across the snow . He hummed an air from the hymnal  --  an old Dutch Resistance marching song  --  and wondered whether he would still be able to pick it out on the parlor harmonium . But Horst had not caught the mood . He frowned at the piece of paper lying on the table . " Was soli das heissen , Jeroen ? " What the devil did all that mean ? His heavy voice was plaintive . Patiently Jeroen translated the message . There was a Vermeer in the Potter woman 's collection , as well as a Titian , but no Giorgione , alias " Big George . " In compensation , there was a Bosch . " Widderhintere " was Ramsbotham ; he collected sportingart , including Dufy ( " Duffy " ) and Degas racing subjects  --  no ballet dancers . " Cousin Margaret " was the big woman ; sacred art was her field . She owned El Grecos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelangelo and Raphael ( the " archangels " ) , a Fra Angelico , and a number of Italian primitives , unidentifiedexcept for Lorenzo Monaco ( " Lorenzo the Monk " ) .  |p232The  last passage to come through was hard to decipher , perhapsgarbled : " Chadwick , sagt Anna , hat 8 grosser kinder . " Eight important pictures , but what ? It was good that Horst found the answer . " Sagt Anna " equaled " Says Anne " : Chadwick had eight Cezannes . The search plane had completed its mission ; the sound of the motors grew fainter as it gained altitude . The others , bursting into the kitchen , did not need to be told that the news was tremendous ; they could read it on the faces of Horst and Jeroen . These collectors were the real thing . A Vermeer , a Titian , a Bosch , eight Cezannes  --  those were sufficient credentials . Yet , as always , there were some  --  the greedy Greet , in particular  --  whowere not satisfied , who had to know more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four had been summarized . " Elfride , we must speak to Aachen again . They should finish their report to us . " She moved to the set . Jeroen held up a hand . " Neen . " Anothercontact with the comrades , he warned her , was not to be dreamed of at the moment . Supposing the search plane 's radio had picked up even a small portion of the last transmission ? She had not thought of that . There was a silence . The stewardess put in her head and withdrew . " Wir haben das Wesentliche , " Horst said . " I support Jeroen . Now let us have some soup . " At the stove , Greet picked up the soup ladle and filled seven bowls : " Ahmed , what are you doing here ? You should be on guard duty . " She raised her bowl . " Eight Cezannes . I toast you , Jeroen . " " To Werner , " he corrected . " To the revolution . " From now on , he could see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He had proved himself.  |p233It  was their fourth day of captivity , and their second pent up in this farmhouse . The worst , Sophie thought , was not the crowdingand lack of sleep or even the endless guessing based on ignorance but the fact that there was nothing to read . The only books were a kind of farmer 's almanac , a children 's encyclopedia , and the Bible  --  all in Dutch , naturally . Last night they had had the distraction of watching television , with Henk doing simultaneous translation , but this morning the screen was an empty gray , matching the weather and their tired minds . In Holland , it seemed , there were never any television programsin the daytime , when people were assumed to be at work  --  " Very civilized , Mynheer , " gamely commented Simmons . " I could do without Barbara Walters , could n't you , Sophie ? " In the kitchen , the hijackers had a radio and they had let Denise , the stewardess , listen to Radio Belge while she was preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was expected within a few hours ; there was a report that a message had been received from the hijackers but as yet no official confirmation . Henk thought that if there were any real breakthrough , television , exceptionally , would be on the air with photo bulletins ; they would not have to wait , like last night , for the evening news to show them that the Air Force and the Navy were still looking for them . In any case , since early morning there had been activity overhead , which offered the hope that their placep234of imprisonment had been spotted . Military planes passed and repassed , possibly taking photographs , but then flew away withouttrying to land . From the farmhouse windows the highway was invisible , and the men , when they went out to pee and relieve their bowels after breakfast , had heard no rumble of traffic that would indicate the approach of a rescue force . It was strange that in all this time  --  Tuesday and nearly half of Wednesday  --  not even the mailman or a traveling salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen door . After the milling and confusion of yesterday , the hostages were settling in , establishing routines alarmingly suggestive of permanence , though they did not see this themselves . Routines gave them a feeling of security , Sophie supposed ; the first-class passengers must be used to having their wealth of time organizedfor them , as on cruises and " cures " and country houseparties . In the parlor today , by general request , Frank had conducted morning service . Now , warming to his role of pastor cum cheer-leader , he was trying to pick out Episcopal hymns on the old Calvinistic harmonium , which wheezed and groaned as if in dissent . It was a solo performance ; invited to " singalong , " the others only hummed or beat time with a foot and eventually ceased to follow . Margaret , the big millionairesstheywere on first-name terms this morning  --  had installed herself , like one administering a hint , on the horsehair sofa with the green folder " Torture and Illegality in Iran . " It should have been reading time  --  study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folders were the only fresh reading matter aside from archaeological guides to Persia , an English pocket Bible , Wild Life of the Near East , and the Book of Common Prayer that the hand baggage had yielded . The news magazines , Vogues , and Harper 's Bazaars they had had with them in the Boeing had exhausted their usefulness during the long wait at Schiphol . In Sophie 's carryall was an old copy of Harper 's with an article by her in it which she had brought along as a credential , but she was too shy as yet to offer it  --  selfish of her , she feared . Just beyond , in the family living-room , a checkers game was in progress , with coins for pieces . Using Eloise 's manicure scis/sors , Johnnie was cutting photos from a Dutch illustrated magazineto make a set of playing cards . It was a sign of something maybe that the dread " Gretel "  --  whose real name proved to be Greet , short for Margaretha  --  had not seen fit to confiscate the scissors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother 's trunk " with Beryl and the curator , their suggestion of charades having been rebuffed . Sophie had played it ad infinitum on rainy days , which was most of the time , in a Wasp girls ' camp in Maine ; the idea was to fill the " trunk " with unlikely and giggle-producing articles that each player had to name over in the correct order before adding a new one . Thus , this morning : " Sunpruf cream , a rosary , Muhammad Ali 's jock-strap , Odorono , Les tres riches heures du duc de Berry , Nixon 's Six Crises . . . " For a while , the Senator had been refereeing but now he was showing Victor a match game , " Cannibals and Missionaries , " that had been popular with navy flyers during the War . Here in the parlor , as Frank pumped out " JEsus CALLS us O'ER the TUmult , " those allergic to games in the morning were resorting to conversational gambits to make the time pass . " Are you related to the lovely old rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She means Dr. Van Fleet , " interposed Margaret , looking up from her reading . " Of course , " said Lily . Her soft blue eyes dwelt encouragingly on Henk . " A pure pale pink climber and a great New England favorite . One does n't find it any more in the catalogues . Mother had it on a trellis outside the library door of the old house in Yarmouth . Ideal for cutting , like a hybrid tea . I believe there was a Mrs. Van Fleet too . " " He spells it differently , Lily , " Helen Potter ventured . " With a V. " " V into F. A common New World corruption , " observed Charles . " We Americans wrote down words as we heard them  --  phonetically , do n't you see ? But the great hybridizer , Dr. W. Van Fleet , can hardly have been family ' to our distinguished young friend . The Dutch connection there would have been remote . His work was done at Bell Station , Maryland . And the family of climbers associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your China teas atp236all . " " Silver Moon , " said - Helen . " Dorothy Perkins . Now I ask myself who she was . " It was astonishing to Sophie how much knowledge such " old money " people hoarded , like stringsavers ; its value , apparently , lay in its total uselessness and inapplicability to the practical world . " Ah , yes , " fluted Charles , as if responsive to Sophie 's thought . " Those old dooryard hybrids mean nothing to the rose fancier today . They were retired ' from service years ago , like a line of automobiles . One can not guess the reason ; your Dr. Van Fleet was extremely hardy and free-flowering . But no doubt if one looked into it one would discover a Marxist explanation . The eternal profit motive . " The Bishop , who had been dozing in a straight chair , opened his eyes . " Damn them ! " he pronounced , fiercely , and then continued his nap . Lily seemed disappointed . The hope of " placing " Van Vliet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing lady , she was bent on pursuing connections ; in her world , Sophie guessed , everyone had to be related , if only to a rose . The pursuit of connections extended " one 's " boundaries ; the poor souls did not wish to feel narrow in their outlook . This had led to a quite comical incident with the Tupamaro on the first night . " I am Carlos , " he had said , introducing himself to the roomful of hostages he was to guard . At which Lily had risen from her couch of folded mink , as if from her tea-table , to receive him . " Not the Carlos ! " she had breathed . But he too had to disappoint her . He was not the " most wanted , " Number One terrorist , Vladimir Ilych Ramirez , but just a Carlos . Lily 's graciousness had thereupon abated , but not so that he could feel an abrupt loss of interest ; the cooling of her manner was gradual , a gentle drop in temperature that only another perfect lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on having failed to strike a sympathetic chord with the bright-cheeked deputy , she turned to Margaret and lightly tapped the green folder . " Is it interesting ? " " Not exactly hammock reading , " Margaret growled . Lily spied a second folder peeping out of Frank 's briefcase . " May I ? " She slowly turned the pages . No one spoke . Henk was study/ing the Flevoland listings in the regional telephone directory . Helen was dead-heading the housewife 's plants , dropping the faded blossoms into an outspread Kleenex . Sophie , her looseleafnotebook on her knee , was starting to keep a journal  --  it would be something to read tomorrow . Underneath the plant table , Cameron was busy with pencil and paper constructing a crossword puzzle ; he was half hidden , as if in a rich tent , by the oriental rug that hung down over the sides like a tablecloth . At the harmonium , Frank had shifted to " Fairest Lord Jesus . " " Please ! " Lily murmured , indicating the soft pedal . Margaret added her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should say  --  do you intend to keep pumping at that melodeon all morning ? Some of us here are musical . " The minister jumped up from the stool , apologizing . In the quiet , they watched Lily read . " Have you come to the toaster thing ? " Helen asked . Lily shook her head . Helen sighed . " Ghastly . " They noticed that Henry was preparing to speak : his gray head and long spare body gave preliminary jerks and nods , like a wind-up toy startingto move  --  stage fright or alcoholic trembles ? " T-toaster , my eye , " he finally brought out . " It takes my sainted wife to believe that . I d-dipped into the bloody stuff this morning and , believe me , I could have found a better use for good p-paper outdoors . " " Please , Henry ! " said his wife . He started , and shook himself , like one awaking , and then began to mumble , nodding to himself . " Ladies present , Henry . ' Must remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Bishop was watching him with concern . The others averted their eyes . It was an embarrassing metamorphosis . The dignified old beau appeared staggeringly drunk , which was impossible  --  nobody had had a moment unobserved . Yet in a minute he recovered himself . The thick speech miraculously cleared , and he found his lost train of thought . " Yes , as I was saying , Lily , what I 'd like to know is who gets this material out . It 's not signed , you 'll notice . Means nobody stands behind it . Anonymoushate literature is what it looks like , I 'm afraid . People in our position ought to make it a principle never to read any/thing that somebody - has n't put his John Hancock to . Saves a lot of time too . On that principle , I never look at an editorial in a newspaper . Why should I have my mind poisoned by somebody I do n't even know ? And from what I 've been told the Shah 's a gentleman or as near to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have letters to him . That should say something . " Henk tapped his head warningly with a forefinger , and Sophie nodded . But the others were going to argue with this lunatic . " Now wait a minute there ! " burst out the minister . " You 're taking a very illiberal attitude . An ignorant attitude , sir . The Gospels are n't signed , and do you refuse to read them ? Do you close your mind to Homer ? " " I agree , Reverend , " cried Aileen . " Why should we have to listen to this affluent nonsense ? Does he refuse to read the Dow Index and the Stock Exchange quotations ? They 're not signed , but I 'll bet he reads them religiously . Do n't you ? Come on , admit it ! " " But he does n't , " said Helen . " Henry says a gentleman leaves the financial page to his broker . " " Does he leave it to his butler to shit for him ? " called out Victor from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was collecting in the doorway . Carey stood in the center with folded arms and a look of amusement . Beside him appearedHarold , truculent as always . " What 's going on ? Was somebody in here talking about climbers ? " " Climbing roses , Chaddie , " said Eloise . " Now they 're arguing about some silly report on torture . " " What do you mean , silly ' ? " " What do you know ? " Several angry voices were shouting at once . Ahmed , posted in the hallway , could be heard calling to Jeroen to come from the kitchen . Then Charles raised a pale hand . " My dears , we do sound like a prison riot . And we do n't want to be punished , do we ? Although , with all this din , some of us might welcome a turn in solitary . Potter , dear fellow , our companions are a committee to look into these allegations . Or were a committee , I should say . No doubt you are n't aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm sure . When and if their report is made , it will of course carry their signatures . You need have no fear on that score . For my part ,  |p239I  have n't had access to these particular documents , but friends abroad , knowing my interests , send me cuttings on affairs of this kind . The electric grill you mention is a matter of record . I believe I have even seen a diagram . One can picture it as a pop-up toaster or as one of those sandwich-like contrivances our countrymen use to carbonize beefsteaks at their cook-outs '  --  deplorable practice and quite carcinogenic , I 'm told . " A shriek came from Simmons . " Does n't he slay you ? " she said to Sophie . " Yes , " said Sophie . It was true that she found Charles a rather frightening personality . He intended to shock , of course , but was it shock therapy he had in mind or some dreadfulprivate joke ? In any case , it was working here . The checkers players drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foursome : " Two no trump . " In the parlor , the discussion moved on to cancer and a supposed cure for cancer . The Bishop produced his flask  --  a horn of plenty or pitcher of Baucis and Philemon  --  and offered a nip to Henry , who had begun to shake again . Soon the shakes stopped . The episode led Sophie to wonder about the effects of deprivationif the present state of affairs were to continue long . What would happen when the Bishop 's flask , which he must be replenishing from that hold-all , finally ran dry ? Henry might get a rather high-priced cure , for which his wife would be grateful . But what about tobacco  --  Cameron 's pipe , Henk 's cigars , her own and Aileen 's cigarettes ? Most of the hostages were addicts of one kind or another , she supposed . With the older people , if it was not liquor or tobacco  --  Charles allowed himself a single Sobranie after meals as an aid to digestion  --  it would be pills . Yet the terrorists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vices or " dependences " themselves , would be in no position , even if willing , to cater to their captives ' habits when private stores ran out . This could result in demoralization or , at best , a general fraying of nerves . The solidarity of the hostage group  --  such as it was  --  would not be proof against sudden fits of irritability such as they had just seen . With this in mind , Sophie was already rationing her cigarette consumption , so as to be able to share . In her bag were two cartons of Trues , de/signed to last three weeks in Iran , but in four days , thanks mainly to the harrowing time at Schiphol , one was half gone . Now , however , it should not be too hard to cut down ; in these close rooms smoking seemed anti-social anyway . And yet , to her shame and surprise  --  she was used to thinking of herself as a both contained and generous person  --  she had felt something close to fury when Beryl , twice , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that extreme situations brought out the truth of one 's character . Another cherished image , she realized , was a picture of herself as fearless which she had come to accept on hearsay : " You 're so brave , Sophie . " Would she have to discard that too ? So far , she thought she could say honestly , she had not been really afraid . But so far nothing really scary had happened , and it was possible that when a test came she would discover , simply , that up to then she " had never known the meaning of fear . " She replaced the cigarette  --  which would have been her fourth since breakfast  --  in the pack and took up her notebook again . " Eleven-thirty a.m. , Flevoland . . . " She wrote on steadily , but there was little to record but her thoughts  --  only the occasional buzz of a plane overhead , the passage of a solitary heron and a flock of black birds with white bills that Henk said were coots from the Ijsselmeer . Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the circumstances , being a slow reader was enviable : she had got two hours , Sophie estimated , out of roughly eighty double-spaced pages , which worked out to about two-thirds of a page a minute . She polished her reading-glasses with a chamois and restored them to their embroidered case . " Could the Shah be back of this , I wonder ? " " Back of what , Mother ? " Beryl had got tired of packing her grandmother 's trunk and was staring out the window in the parlor . " This , " repeated Lily , waving a hand . She meant the hijacking , obviously . " Oh , Mother , do n't be so stupid . How could the Shah figure ? " " Very simply , " Henk answered . " The idea is not stupid . Or at any rate I have had it myself . " " Me too , " agreed Sophie . To anyone with a political head it was by no means improbable that , if not the Shah inp241person , SAVAK , his secret police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henk was pointing out , collusion between " red " terrorists and " black " secret police was classical ; it went back at least to czarist Russia . But by what route the insight had entered Lily 's mind was a mystery . Had they " done " The Possessed at Saint Timothy 's under an unusually thorough teacher ? Sophie sought to imagine Lily in middy and skirt delivering an oral report on the ties between the Okhrana and terrorist circles such as Dostoievsky described in the novel . In any case , the insight , however come by , was impressive in a woman of her background . But " awfully far-fetched " opined Margaret , and the Reverend concurred , though from a different starting-point , clearly . She refused to entertain the thought because it reflected on the ethics of the Shah , and Frank would not harbor it because he ( lid not want to be " over-critical " of the terrorists . Whereas Beryl , more simply , scouted it because it had been voiced by her mother . It was an interesting study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And still another factor was at work in these minds , as Sophie slowly recognized  --  the ineluctablefactor of class . Shah or no Shah , the first-class hostages , on the whole , resented any suggestion that the hijacking could have been aimed at passengers in Economy . They preferred to see themselves as the sole cause . And vice versa . " How can you talk such nonsense , lily ? " boomed Margaret . " I do n't give a fig about the Shah , but it was us these people were after  --  no question of it . " " But why us , dear ? " wailed Lily . " Because we 're filthy rich , Mother ; that 's why . " " The Shah does n't want our money , " pursued Margaret . " He can buy and sell the lot of us . That 's why he could n't be behind this outrage for a minute . But the gang in there was after our money all right . They marked the plane clown because they heard we would be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can , Madam . " Cameron 's voice , accompanied by a puff of pipe smoke , came like an oracle from under the table . " You confuse two notional sequences . Lack of training in clear think/ing , I daresay . Let us separate the two sequences and examine them . Taking the premise that you were the target , I believe we can all agree that the Shah may be exculpated . As you say , he has no need of money , least of all dollars , of which you have a great many , if I can judge by my ears . But this premise can not be assumed ; it is what you started out to prove . Therefore , rightly , it should appear at the end of your argument , as the logical or persuasive conclusion . If we take the opposite premise , that the committee in Economy was the target , then things have another look . The Shah can not be cleared of suspicion . We may decide that he was the priming agent that set the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret-police budget  --  this was not engineered on a shoestring . The more we consider it , the more plausible it comes to seem that the committee was indeed the target . But again we are assuming what we set out to prove . Moreover , if we affirm that the committee was the target , this leaves us to explain your presence here , just as your belief that you and you alone were aimed at leaves you to explain our presence . It might be useful to think in terms of primary and secondary targets . In that case , the simplest hypothesis , and hence the one to be preferred , is that we were the primary target , that is , in essence the Shah 's pigeon  --  though we may have been interesting to these anarchistsfor other reasons  --  and that you , ab initio , or at some later stage , came to be viewed as a prize in your own right . " " Bravo , Archie , " applauded Henk . " Beautiful , " said Sophie . " My God ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to set that carpet on fire ! " In fact a coal from the don 's pipe must have singed the rug from under which his bristly head had appeared . There was a smell of burning wool . " Water ! " called Beryl . " Ahmed , quick , bring some water ! " " Dear me , no , " said Charles . " You must smother it . " After a minute , thanks to Charles 's recipe , the incipient fire had been put out , leaving only a charred spot . But the argument smoldered . " The Shah 's a red herring , " declared Henry . " I have n't seen a shred of evidence that connectshim . Just a bee in certain bonnets and logic-chopping. "  |p243That  was true , Sophie reflected . Henry continued , observing that he had the floor . " Let 's take a look at what 's under our noses . Put yourself in the shoes of these people here . " " Who are you speaking to ? " said Aileen . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue in her head . I 'd like to hear your opinion . Assuming you were a terrorist , would you hold you for ransom or my wife ? I 've no doubt that you have many fine personal qualities that make you valuable to your associates , whatever you do in life , but let me state it bluntly : what do you own ? " " Just the clothes on my back , " said Aileen , preening . " These old rags from Filene 's . " " Well , then ? " She pursed her lips and grew serious , as though the educator in her had been called on to address this forum . " I 'm important in what I stand for . My name counts . The half-dozen boards and committees I serve on represent the most vital currents in American opinion . I 'm a public person , Mister Potter . You do n't know what that means . Why , right this minute , I 'll bet , my picture is on the front page of the Times , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurlbut 's , I guess . And thousands of my alumnae are deeply concerned for my fate . You ca n't say that for your wife and her friends . They 'll be lucky if their picture is in the society columns , which have blacks and Jews nowadays , in case you do n't know it . I 'm sorry , Mister Potter , but you do n't mean anything in the world . And nobody is more on to that than a terrorist . All that these Baader-Meinhofs and so on care for is publicity , being spread over the front page . They 're totally indifferent to money ; the sensational million-dollar ransoms they demand are just headline-grabbers . Now who is going to get them more publicity , who is the public truly anxious about , our committee or your ridiculous tour ? Add to that the fact , which is probably news to you , that they hate liberals even more than you do . Because they 're serious and know that we 're the enemy . We stand in their way . " Simmons 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her eyes sparkled . She seemed earnestly moved , almost to the point of tears , as though the convictionp244she had of her importance were a religious matter  --  a cause she was pleading . But the collector group was offended , and the Bishop was shaking his head in sorrow , maybe at the prospect of another rift . Besides , it was unchristian , surely , to tell anotherhuman being to his face that he was nobody . Without being a sorrowing Christian , Sophie felt shocked and troubled herself . To her mind , it was a shameless performance , regardless of the truth of the assertions , which in fact somehow made it worse . She smiled comfortingly at Lily , who smiled back . Henry and Helen sat rigid . To make things worse , Beryl decided to weigh in . She turned on the finally silent Aileen . " I know you , " she said rudely . " Thousands of alumnae ' ! You 're Simmie . ' You were the registrar at Lucy Skinner when they kicked me out . But you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were no flaming liberal . Remember , Sophie ? " " I did n't go to Lucy Skinner , " said Sophie , glad to be able to stay out of this . " The laughing cavalier ! " suddenly cried Lily . She was indicatingHenk . " I knew I knew that face . Do n't you see it , Helen ? A haunting resemblance . If you just add a tiny chin beard and mustaches . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " said Beryl . " Why , the Hals in the Wallace Collection , darling . The subject must have been an ancestor of yours , Henk . " " Oh , Christ , " repliedBeryl . " Stop trying to create a diversion . Or stop being so obvious about it . " Upon this , silence ensued . You could hear Aileen sniffling . At a meaningful nod from the Bishop , Frank installed himself once more at the harmonium and sounded a chord for attention . " Let 's try to sort this out . Does it really matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women who are holding us in captivity ? We each have our own kind of importance . Maybe we 're symbols of things they do n't like in the world of today . That 's what I try to bear in mind . They do n't hate me as an individual , I tell myself . They want to change the system of which we 're all a part , like it or not . You and I , Aileen , as well as Henry . And I ca n't say that I blame them ,  |p245though  I may question their methods . Even there we must n't be too sure . I bring not peace but a sword , ' our Lord said . But the main fact to remember is that we 're all in this together . We do n't know why we 've been chosen . Indeed , there is some mystery to it , I have to admit , as in God 's inscrutable ways . Not that I mean to compare the election that has fallen on us with a divine intervention , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed like a holy terror . " " Oh , my God , " muttered Sophie . But the good man was under a strain . It was not easy to play the peacemaker among these heathen . As for the habit of punning , that must be a tic , like the preaching habit which it seemed to go along with and which was maybe uncontrollable too . The poor fellow had been deformed by an unnatural occupation . " Lordy , " he said , " there I go again . I can never resist a pun , my youngsters complain . Yes , but seriously , there may be food for thought there as to how these young folk conceive their mission , that Jeroen in particular . Strict Calvinist home , he confided in me when I was drawing him out . Well . Perhaps we shall eventually learn whether our carrier was singled out on account of the worldly goods of some of us or on account of the place some others of us occupy in the community . As we have been reminded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or chance , if there is such a thing  --  which as a Christian I 'm taught to doubt  --  may have been responsible for our being gathered in this place together . Our captors may have struck at random , as the fishermancasts his net on the waters unwitting what the catch will be . Some passengers , as we have seen , were thrown back into the sea of ordinary daily life to go about their business like fish of no commercial value . And we have been retained . Whatever the reason behind that , we must look on our being here as a call . A call to deepen our faith and our brotherly love , which may be sorely tested . To extend our experience , launch our frail barks onto uncharted waters . Not everyone has the good fortune  --  yes , the good fortune  --  to be hijacked . " He paused , as though prepared for a stir of dissent . But nop246one contested him . " To be shaken out of his complacency , dislodgedfrom his daily unthinking rut . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galilean lake , Turned from home and toil and kindred , Leaving all for His , dear sake . ' That is why I chose the dear old hymn just now . To show us that we have been given an opportunity . Through this unforeseen contact with our captors we can be enlarged . " " I like unforeseen contact , ' " murmured Henk . Sophie giggled . Yet there was merit in the minister 's thought , if only it could be freed from the clerical gaiters it wore . " We will be bigger people for it , if we will only let ourselves . Let us not brood over the mystery that has assembled us in this place or compete for precedence one over the other in our captors ' eyes . " " Hear , hear ! " said Henk , clapping . " Amen , " said the Bishop . But Frank had not finished . " Let us , rather , accept it as coming from God , whether we believe in a personal God or merely in some higher force . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sir . " Denise was standing in the doorway . " I do not like to interrupt , but some passengers are wanted in the kitchen . First Mrs. Potter , please . " Helen rose and followed the stewardess . Her small pigeon-breasted figure appeared resolute . " The call , ' " commented Aileen . Beryl grinned at Sophie . " Makes me think of being sent for to the headmistress 's office . " Sophie remembered . In the classroom , when the summons came , nobody ever supposed that the one sent for was going to hear anything good  --  the best hope was that it would be just a death in the family . It was the same here . Everybody avoided Henry Potter 's eye , as if an execution were already taking place . " It 'll be Ma 's turn next , want to bet ? " said Beryl . The smell of pea soup heating in the kitchen provided some wan reassurance . If lunch was about to be served , nothing very terriblecould be happening in there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But why poor old Helen ? " spoke up Henry . " Helen first , " emphasized Margaret . " Do n't worry , they 'll have the rest of us on the carpet before long . Malefactors of great wealth . ' Remember ? He was the start of all this . I wasp247a girl then , but Father knew it . " " That does n't answer my question , Maggie . Why my wife first ? Why not Johnnie ? " " Maybe just because we ask that , " quietly said Sophie . " The aim of terror is to terrify , is n't it , and the trick there is to be arbitrary , above the rules of reason . Logically they should have started with Mr. Ramsbotham . It makes sense because he 's the richest and a man . But if they acted logically , that would give us a handle on them . " Henk agreed . " Maybe they drew straws , and your wife 's was the short one . The point is for their actions to defy understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , as Sophie says , to the laws of reason . " " Quite , " said Cameron , his head again emerging . " Yet if your conjecture is right , then you have understood and even given a name to a principle governing their behavior . That it answers to the name of arbitrary ' still means that one can subsume it under a general law , in other words conclude that by and large one can expect aleatory conduct from them . " " Well , I suppose that 's some comfort , Beryl , " Lily said cheerfully . Beryl laughed . " Can you define aleatory ' by any chance , Mother ? " " ' Dicey . ' A lea jacta est , ' " supplied Henry , causing Margaret to shake her large head and sigh . " The ruin of a fine mind , " she pronounced in a carrying bass aside . " To understand that there 's no understanding what they 're up to , " Lily mused . " And yet I have the funniest inkling . Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening . " " For heaven 's sake , how ? " said Margaret . " These rooms could be bugged , ' " Lily retorted . " Quite true , " said Henk , before Beryl could contradict . " I have been thinking that too . " " Well , whisperit , then , Mother , " prompted Beryl . " Just a minute ! " said Frank . " Let 's make assurance doubly sure . " He began to play chopsticks energetically on the harmonium . Lily spoke into her daughter 's ear . In turn Beryl whispered to Sophie : " The Vermeer . " By the time it reached Cameron , it had become " Fear more . " But most had understood . Though not as rich as Johnnie , Helen was the star collector : she owned a Vermeer . The gravity of the first-class faces left no doubt as to the in/ference being drawn . It was as though Lily had voiced a collectivethought that had lain too deep for words . The collectors sat with bowed heads , reflecting . Prompted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was considering his own valuables . Even the outsiders were moved to sober reflection , like spectators watching a stranger 's coffin pass . " Is it an important Vermeer ? " Simmons whispered and , on being assured that it was , fell to pondering . It was not the occasion to tell her that there were no unimportant Vermeers ; the parlor was silent , as if it contained mourners . In the next room , the games came to a respectful halt as word of the " inkling " leaked . Sitting with folded hands , Sophie was led to think of the death of Sapphire , she was not sure why . What did Victor 's wickedly murdered pet have in common with a Vermeer of Delft except the color blue ? Or  --  more to the point  --  that each was a rarity , a " pearl " of its kind ? If Sapphire had been an alley cat , would she have got the same treatment ? Sophie had no idea of what might be in the rest of the collections , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists caused her sympathetic nervous system pain . If they could deliberately shoot a superb Persian cat  --  there had been two shots , she clearly remembered  --  there must be policy behind it . Sapphire had died as an advertisement of some unusualintention . That strange young man , Jeroen , might view himself and his band as apostles of " desacralization , " which would be terror in a pure state , she guessed . In comparison , treating the lives of adult human hostages as bargaining countersseemed like normal , " civilized " warfare . To her surprise , Henk was winking at her . He tapped his head again . Unwillingly , she saw what he was trying to tell her . To a rational mind , he meant , this was a nutty example of group-think : these people had become possessed by the notion that their art treasures were in danger , without asking themselveshow that could be or considering it aloud as an objective proposition . They " felt it in their bones , " and the feeling was so strong that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction that had personal cause for anxiety . Onlyp249Ifenk , a Dutch skeptic , seemed to be immune . To judge by the silence , everyone else was just as suggestible as Sophie herself . The first sight of Helen removed any uncertainty . Their hones had been right . The tribunes of the people had decreed that she could have her freedom in exchange for the " Girl in a Blue Cap with a Guitar . " Henry 's freedom would cost her a " Titian . They had wanted the little Bosch , too  --  hardly bigger than a postage stamp  --  but mercifully it was on show in Los Angeles ; she had a clipping from Time to prove it . The group had tried her and passed sentence , payment in kind , from which there could be no appeal . She had begged them  --  on her knees , literally  --  to take her whole fortune in the place of the " Girl " but without any effect . Snuffling and wiping her pale eyes , rejecting Henry 's effort to quiet her and Denise 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into her confidence . Around her an eager ring formed , curiosity proving stronger than pity . Ransoming Henry , she told them , would not be so very painful ; the Titian was studio work mostly , and she had never cared for the subject . But she would almost rather die , she had decided , than see harm come to the precious Vermeer  --  in perfect condition , with its wonderful crackle ; when its near-replica , " The Guitar Player , " had been seized from Kenwood House , she had suffered untold agonies , even though its " execution " by the vandals would have made her own unique . They had given her an hour to make up her mind . Next Harold was tapped , then Johnnie , then Margaret , then Charles , and finally Lily . " Cheer up , Mother , " counseled Beryl . " The pecking order proves that they do n't know the value of fine English water-colors . ' " For a perhaps evident reason the " boys " from Antibes were not being summoned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to declare , ' " John , the younger , hazarded with a nervous giggle , as though apologizing for their luck . One by one , with increasing rapidity , the others rejoined their fellows : Harold was supported by the steward ; Lily flew to Beryl 's arms . Unlike Helen , they were keeping their ownp250confidence . Whatever sentence had been passed on them was not for general consumption . Disregarding the compassionate eyes turned on them , they bunched in desolate twos and threes , like stately crows in a flock of starlings . Helen was finally persuaded to go into the parlor , out of the melee . If it had been possible , Sophie would have fled the scene . She did not like the position of onlooker . It was obscene , like sitting in perfect health in a surgeon 's waiting-room and watching the patients emerge . " They must resent us , " murmured Henk . " If they 're aware that we 're here , " said Carey . " Does n't look much like it . " In her own way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go in and offer Helen our sympathy , do n't you think ? I was kind of mean back then . " " You can try , " said Sophie , unwillingly tagging along . The trouble was , it was impossible to sympathize in the true meaning of the word . You could not put yourself in the place of someone who owned a Vermeer  --  it was not a universal experience . You might be able to feel with a millionaire who had lost all his money ; on a smaller scale , it could happen to you . But here the best you could do was to sympathize with the innocent Vermeer itself . To tell Helen you were sorry only marked the distance between you and her . But " Thank you , my dear , " Helen answered . " I 'm sure you mean it . " Soon the service of lunch intervened , breaking up the knots of collectors and generally loosening tongues . Discussion of the predicament of the few spread to the many . The greatest puzzle , it was agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the collections . " Attributed to Titian , " they had said to Helen . Amazing . They were even up on the fact that she had arranged to give her Giorgione  --  pen-and-wash ; unique  --  to the National Gallery . Most people thought it was hanging there on loan . That they knew about Johnnie 's sporting art was peculiar too , surely . Stubbs was a " name , " but how many hijackers had heard of Ben Marshall ? Until a few minutes ago , Sophie had never heard of him herself . " Did you ask how they got their information ? " The question was stupid ; asking would have been a waste of breath . And not a word had been volun/teered , naturally , that would give a clue . Jeroen , it seemed , had had lists in front of him which he consulted , leaving it up to the victim to affirm or deny . Poor Helen had begun by trying to disavow her Vermeer . " But it was all written down there  --  the size and the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her paper plate . " She could see that he knew , " explained Henry . " But what crime were you charged with ? " interrupted Aileen . " I mean , specifically ? " " Possession of art works stolen ' from the people , " answered Johnnie with a short laugh . " What can you say to an arraignment like that ? That you bought them or had them left to you ? To this kangaroo court , that 's no defense . They shut you up by reading to you from the damn lists they 've got  --  the evidence , as they see it . I must say , it 's uncanny , finding they have it all there in black and white . Shakes a fellow up , almost makes him feel guilty as charged . Especially if he tries to hold anything back . Just to give you an example , I thought they 'd missed out on my Degas , and so naturally I did n't call the oversight to their attention . Then damned if they didd n't come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie nodded . It was cruel of them , she thought  --  a refinement of malice to let the collectors " prove " their guilt by denials and evasions and then face them with a full bill of particulars obtained from an unguessable quarter . The suspicion that someone had informed was inevitable . During lunch it was vacillating between Charles and Warren , the curator . Or so Beryl , who was in on their councils , reported . " Would n't you know they 'd want to hang it on a queer ? " Beryl herself would have liked to hang it on " Simmie , " but there was no way : " The hag knows nothing about pictures . " The conchie minister , she said , knew about Lily 's collection , but that was from long ago : " Most of the things Ma had then have gone on the block . " The Economy class hostages had all been given a clean bill of health . " Ma pretends to be glad of it . Maybe she really is . Have you noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it followed that the millionaireshad to believe that the culprit was one of their own partyp252or else that a tip had come from an outside source . You would have thought that they would have embraced the second theory , for their own peace of mind , but they were unreasonably slow in coming to it , said Beryl , and only through a process of eliminationworthy of Sherlock Holmes . " The finger ca n't point to Eddie and John . They do n't know any of us but Warren . And Warren , my God , is just an orientalist . How would he know about Johnnie 's stuff ? " The logical suspect , among their own number , was Charles , of course . He had come back from his interrogationcrowing that he had been " let off scot-free " ; his own explanation was that he had persuaded the gang that the few porcelains he still owned were too fragile to be moved unlesshe packed them himself . Yet it could also mean that he had been " singing " for his supper . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others decided that they did n't want to think that of him , really . You know why ? Because we 've known him all our lives . ' That 's what they call being fair . ' " " Why do n't they suspect you , Beryl ? " They ought to , in view of Ahmed , Sophie was thinking . Beryl shrugged . " Because they 've known Ma all their lives , I guess . " Anyhow , now they were leaning toward the " outside source " theory . It supported their faith in having been the sole motive for the hijacking . " This proves it to the hilt , " proclaimed Margaret . " Before we ever left our homes , these people knew down to the last brush-stroke what was in our collections . This was planned months in advance , as soon as some revolutionary read in the Museum bulletin about our tour to Iran . But they had to wait till we got to De Gaulle because the security at Kennedy was too tight ! " " Idlewild , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How could they have got the nuts and bolts on my Cezannes in this godforsaken hole ? No way . The only puzzler is why they waited so long to spring it on us . " " Should n't we be helping Helen to think now ? " said Lily , looking at her watch . " She has to decide very soon . But there 's so much that she does n't know , that none of us knows . What are they plotting to do with the Vermeer , with all our lovely things ? They ca n't be thinking of bringing them here . I madep253bold to ask , but of course they would n't say . All they said was that if I wanted to return to my family unharmed I must make a tape instructing them to carry out orders for the delivery of my Samuel Palmer and my Turners and Cotmans  --  they did n't seem at all interested in Girtin , although he was so important . I had no need to know more than that , they told me . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions for packing and delivery would follow . But , as I tried to explain to them , since Joe died my only close family is Beryl . I would n't trust my sister-in-law , dear that she is , to know a Cotman from  --  " " Personally I think I 'd go along , Lily . That 's the way I 'm tilting myself . Play at being cooperative . I 've pretty well decided to tell them that I accept . And with my Cezannes , I have more at stake . I 'll just make one stipulation . That I direct the tape to my lawyer . Whatever I instruct my lawyer , he 'll know that I 'm under duress , so he 'll have the sense not to play for keeps . With a relative you never can tell . My lawyer ' 11 be smart enough to go through the motions of obeying instructions , in the interests of my and Eloise 's safety , all the time being damn sure that the government is n't going to let him turn over a fortune in irreplaceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Attorney General will get a stay or an injunction or figure out some hokey-pokey . An agreement made under duress is n't binding . What do you think , Carey ? You 're a lawyer . " " I ca n't advise you , " Jim said , rather stiffly . " But I can tell you the law . It 's against U.S. policy to negotiate the demands of hijackers . If your lawyer starts negotiating at your instance , he will go to jail . " " But he would n't negotiate . He 'd fake and stall till the government stepped in . " " It 's not up to the government to do your lawyer 's duty for him . He 's an officer of the court . Of course he could arrive at some agreement with the FBI to seem to play ball with these folks , bait a trap with your works of art or reasonable facsimiles of them . . . . You 're familiar with the scenario , surely . " " Well , fine . It adds up to the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a good boy , so far as the gorillas can see . And I 'll have gained time . They 're not going to shoot me as long as they think they have eight signed Cezannes in the bag . My lawyer 'll need proof that I 'm alive before he agrees to deliver . Even if they start getting impatient , they 'll make up their minds to cool it . " Carey sighed . " If you want to address the tape to your lawyer , I see no objection that Jeroen and Company can have . But you 'll put your lawyer in a hell of a dilemma . He gets an instruction with your voice print on it . Is he supposed to carry it out or not ? Either way , he 's placed in a questionable position . Your instruction tells him to break the law . As an officer of the court , his first duty , then , is to report it . At the same time , being your lawyer , he will feel bound to respect the confidentialityof the communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , not only does he ignore your express instructions , but he also , by the act of reporting it , frustrates any intention you may have of complying . " The warning was clear , Sophie thought , but she was not sure that Chadwick understood . Jim was being cautious , for reasons of his own , and for the first time she saw in him the quality that had disappointed so many of his followers . Simmons saw it too . " He just wo n't commit himself . Look at him , Sophie . " He sat lounging on the floor , with his back against a wall and his long legs stretched out , and was idly tossing a coin . Sophie admitted that this show of detachment must appear cavalier to the millionaires . Yet the very fact that their treasures were at stake  --  to say nothing of their lives , probably , if they refused  --  might excuse his reluctance to pronounce . She wished Henk would say something ; Jim 's being a U.S. senator could be anotherelement , not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the difference between my lawyer and a relative ? " Harold demanded in his customary suspicious tones . Carey caught the coin and with his other hand covered a yawn . " Only that the relative is under no obligation to report a criminal communication of this nature . Otherwise the position is the same . "  | " So do you advise Helen to make the tape ? " said Lily , anxiously looking at her watch again . " Sorry . I ca n't advise you , Lily . It would be improper on my part . I 'll say this much . " Slowly he got to his feet . " Any of you who agrees to make a tape under the existing circumstances will not be regarded as an accessory to a criminal proceeding . On that score , you need have no inhibitions . On the other hand , it would be unwise to think that the making of the tape is the easy way out . Having made it , you may find that you are bound to it . Or that our friends will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Measures of an ugly sort may be taken to induce speed . " " But if we refuse , " said Henry , " they 'll kill us , is n't that the idea ? " The collectors exchanged looks . " We had different impressions , " Lily said . " I certainly thought so , but some of us were n't so sure . I do n't believe the word kill ' was actually used . " " Not to me , " said Johnnie . " It was more of a vague  - -  ienace . " Again , of course , no one had asked . " They left it to our imagination , " said Harold . " Depends on how much you have . " " They were very definite , though , about the deadline , " Lily put in . " Each of us has an hour from the time he was dismissed . I wonder why . " " Prolongs the torture , " Henry suggested . " And on our side of the fence , I do n't see the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give a Yes or a No . " Charles giggled . " Why , by the bye , is it always assumed that time is on the side of the angels ? " " Let 's make the tapes , " declared Margaret , rising . " Where 's the harm in it ? There 's many a slip . . . I shall direct mine to my butler . I 've implicit confidence in his judgment . One 's children can not be wholly objective . Remember that , Helen . Your eldest stands to inherit the lovely Vermeer , does he not ? " " No . " Helen , who had been pacing the carpet with short unsteady steps , plumped herself down like a stout little bolster on the sofa . " No to what , dear ? " cried Lily in a voice of alarm . " No , I sha n't give them the Vermeer . " " Oh , Helen ! " the ladies reproached her in wailing chorus . " No , " Helen repeated with a decisive wobble of her receding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeroen swore to me that not a hair of its head would be harmed . But I 've no right to take his word for it . Any more than if it were a child . The painting will stay where it is , Henry . They can have the Titian if they want . " It became alarmingly clear that she intended to stick to her guns . Henry 's reasoning was useless , and Frank could not shake her resolution , though he was feeling it his pastoral duty to try . Like anyone who has arrived at an immense decision , she had a look of being at rest , serene as a rock in the midst of the storm around her . Bearing out the prophecy that they could be " bigger " for their experience , her dumpy form seemed to have gained a full inch and not only in moral stature . It was a matter of posture , doubtless ; her small muffin head was drawn up and her chest thrust mildly forward as she sat unmoving in the " place of honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of the dauntless stand she had taken or pleased to be the undivided center of attention , but , if so , it only showed in a vague , bemused little smile , which she directedat those around her benignly and sympathetically , as though , from her present modest elevation , they were no longer quite in focus . She did not turn a deaf ear to their arguments and objections but listened politely , with an evident effort at attention , noddingfrom time to time to show that she was following , as no doubt she did at her club when a lecturer dealt with a topic that was " interesting , " although not directly to her . Facing her , Frank had drawn up a straight chair and kept hitching himself forward on it so as to be able to " reach " her . To the audience grouped around them he seemed to be giving a demonstration of his professional skills , like a doctor operating on a patient before a group of students . This was something he could not help , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewingit as a performance , that is , critically , forgetful of the earnestness of his purpose . " Helen ! You bear the same lovely name , torch ' in Greek , as my own wife and daughter . Now let 's think a little about this Vermeer . In the last analysis , it 's a material object , is n't it ?  |p257Just  oil and canvas handled in a certain way that you and I recognize as art . But that 's relative , do n't you agree ? Dependingon the culture we 've been raised in . I mean , to an Eskimo or a Ugandan , the marks on that piece of canvas would n't say a darn thing . Beauty is in the eye of the beholder , ' as the old saw had it . Well , is n't that pretty much accepted by art historianstoday ? In art , we 're responding to a set of conventions , the way we do in our clothes and the food we eat . Some creative spirits want to overthrow those conventions , and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't always understand what they 're getting at . But that 's beside the point . The point is that in our society we 're making a shibbolethof art . We 've learned that there 's nothing sacred or eternal in our dress fashions and food habits . We 've lived through several revolutions in those departments , with women wearing pants and men carrying purses and our young people cooking in woks ' and eating raw fish like the Japanese . . . . Well , you know what I mean . But our attitudes toward art are still as rigid as they ever were , paradoxical as that may sound . We reverence art as something sacred , when we ought to be using it for our enjoyment as we do today with our clothes . Modern art has n't succeeded in liberating man from the fetishism of Art with a capital A. We 've come to worship a class of objects  --  paintings and sculptures  --  and we treat their creators as gods . If we all could be artists , as one day I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . We would n't look on art as precious property to be accumulated by any single person or society . Now , mind you , I think this totemism has a lot to do with the failure of organized religion . Despite church attendance figures , we 've let ordinary humanity lose touch with the divine , with God . No wonder that the lucky few among us are tempted to put daubs of oil on canvas in His place . I say daubs ' deliberately , Helen , to shock you . Remember , we 've just agreed that to the Ugandan your Vermeer is no thing of beauty , and who is to say that he 's wrong ? " " Yes , thank you , Frank . Very interesting . I know you mean well . And I suppose it 's all relative , as you say . I 've neverp258cared much for African sculpture , though I know people who have a passion for it . " Frank hitched himself forward another inch and made a gesture of entreaty . " Helen ! Do you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , recite me the First , then . " " ' Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , ' is that what you mean ? " " Yes , dear Helen . ' Or the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or in the earth beneath , or in the water under the earth . ' This terrible experienceshould bring home to us the good sense of that commandment . Of course what was being enjoined against at that time was the fashioning and worship of idols . Secular art was unknown to the ancient Hebrews and indeed to most of the ancient peoples . And the special genius of the Hebrew religion was that its God was invisible , that is , immaterial , not to be represented or imitated in any material shape or form . The Incarnation , of course , was a radical break with that view of Him . ' And was made man . ' Still , I wonder whether the old ban on representation did n't have more true wisdom in it than our own Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit . Did Moses foresee that the fashioning of images would be bound to lead to the worship of them ? The story of the Golden Calf seems to point that way , does n't it ? " " My wife 's a Presbyterian , " said Henry . " You wo n't find graven images in her church . But you 're dead right on one point . She idolizes that Vermeer . " Helen still wore her dreamy smile . " Did you ever happen to see it , Frank ? It was hanging on show at Wildenstein 's . For the Crippled Children . There was always a throng around it , was n't there , Henry ? " " I 'm sorry , " confessed Frank . " I missed it . I 'm so darned busy with church work that I do n't get out much to exhibitions any more . " " Oh , well , then . . . If you had , you might understand . " She was in love with the picture , that was obvious , though the minister did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a suggestion of tender reminiscence in her tone , a commemorativenote , as though the " Girl " belonged to a distant , enshrined past , too far off now for tears . However the others were interpreting the ultimatum , Helen had clearly decidedp259that she was on her way to a better world , leaving her dear possession behind . Undiscouraged , Frank tried another tack . " Maybe we make too much of a cult of originals . Helen has had the privilege of living with one , but if she 'd lived with a reproduction instead , nobody could take it away from her . If it happened to be stolen , she could always get another , exactly the same . Whereas when you lose a loved one , say a member of your family , there 's no replacement . That 's why , Helen , we hold human life sacred ; the individual in each of us is one of a kind , loved by the ( : rector for the divine unique spark in him . Do n't let your ' torch ' go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it should be to you . You blaspheme if you think of exchanging it for a mere material possession , a thing whose value may be specious  --  in the sense of highly relative  --  as you yourself admit . " But the Vermeer was one of a kind ; that was the point he himself had just made , even if for him it would have done better to exist in the plural . It was odd that he did not see that everything he was saying about human life applied for Helen , equally  --  indeed more emphatically  --  to her " Girl . " " Leave her be , Frankie , " gently spoke up the Bishop . " Let her follow her own counsel . We shall pray for you , my dear , and ask the good Lord to soften the hearts of these misguided young people toward you . " " Helen Potter ! " Jeroen himself stood in the doorway . " Come along now . " Henk half rose , as if to intervene . " Stay where you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not concern you . You also , Henry Potter . Your wife does not need your company . " With her short teeteringsteps , she followed him into the kitchen ; Hussein with his pistol was at her back . The Bishop wiped his eyes . There went the stuff of martyrs . " Queen Victoria , " whispered Henk , gravely approving . In fact there was a resemblance to the queen in her later years , something of pudgy royal dignity , that all at once had become visible . " I suppose I might have offered to take her place , " muttered Henry . " It would n't have done any good , " the others assured him . " She 's made her bed , " said Harold . " Shut up , you , " saidp260Sophie . The door to the kitchen was closed . Outside Hussein stood on guard , his pistol raised . Frank and the Bishop moved their lips in silent prayer . Carey swiftly crossed himself . " I ca n't bear it , " cried Aileen , putting her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any warning , toward the end of the afternoon , the television screen lit up . It was still Wednesday . Yusuf , very helpfully , got to work twirling the dials till the image would stay put . In the box appeared the farrnhouse they were prisonersin , shown from several angles and surprisingly close up . The shots had been taken from the air : those military planes that they had heard zooming about this morning ; sometimes , annoyingly , a wing got in the way of the picture . It was odd to have a bird's-eye view of your place of confinement , which you had never fully seen with your own eyes  --  on the night they had arrived it had been too dark . Now they were able to look down on the broad sloping roof  --  underneath was the drafty attic half of them had been sleeping in  --  the television aerial , the chicken coop and the rabbit run near the spot where the men peed . From above they saw a crisscrossing of canals and ditches , the highway they had landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tarpaulin . Although the snow had melted , the camouflage job was still effective ; examining it from a pilot 's perspective , even Harold admitted to a certain satisfaction in the result of their labors , what the Sophie girl called " pride of workmanship . " Yusuf had turned up the sound , and Henk , who was found napping on the floor behind the sofa , was rushed to the screen to translate . They had missed the beginning while they were trying to wake him up , but they learned  --  what they could seep262anyway  --  that the long-awaited breakthrough had happened . It was the hijackers themselves who had taken the initiative . They had broadcast a message to the authorities announcing their location ; the radio in the kitchen , it seemed , was a powerful short-wave sending and receiving set , which one of the Arabs  --  Yusuf probably  --  had known how to rig up to the TV aerial . Henk and Carey said that they had suspected that there would be a " pirate station " in the house  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it would have cleared up some little misunderstandings . Anyway , the authorities , at first , had treated the message as a hoax , with the result that two whole hours had been lost . The message identifying the " command post 's " position had come through shortly after two , according to the commentator , and now it was a few minutes past four . The program , apparently , had started with a full list of the hijackers ' demands ; that of course would be the part they had missed . But now a spokesman came on the screen recapitulating the chief ones . First , an astronomic ransom  --  one and a quarter million dollars , half to be distributed among the workers and peasants of Surinam  --  for the return of the helicopter and its crew . Second , immediate withdrawal of Holland from NATO and breaking of relations with Israel . Third , liberation of all " class-war prisoners " from Dutch jails . Superficially , that one sounded more feasible : in a very liberal country like Holland , there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean anything , depending on the definition : the release of common criminals , for instance , if they were of working-class origin , which obviouslymost of them would be . ' The demand , Henk said , would be unacceptable as it stood to his government ; several rounds of " clarification " might be needed before the ruling coalition could consider acting on it . Eventually a few fringe elements who by stretching a point could be regarded as political prisonersmight be let out : e.g. , small groups of squatters who had occupied canal houses and struck policemen seeking to evict them . . . . But in his opinion the kapers did not take this demand of theirs too seriously ; it was on their list pro forma ,  |p263to  satisfy revolutionary protocol . The outcome for the hostages would surely not hinge on it . The same with NATO and Israel : lie doubted that the terrorists really expected to change the foreignpolicy of the Netherlands by their " rhetoric "  --  his expression  --  ofviolence . More to the point was the final demand : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up a bundle of tales containing instructions from the prisoners to their famiIieson how to bring about their release . This demand had a deadline attached to it . In less than half an hour from now , the pilot was to begin hovering over a designated spot , which would be marked by a flag and lanterns , thirty meters from the c command post ; at a signal he was to drop a cable . He was not to attempt to land , and any other craft entering the air space ( luring the pick-up would be shot down . The tapes must then he transferred to a long-range carrier and delivered to the families of the hostages ; under no circumstances should they Ice allowed to fall into the hands of the FBI or any other agency of the U.S. imperialist government . Failure to observe this condition would bring immediate reprisals . The Dutch militaryattache in Washington would be held responsible for the prompt transfer of the tapes to the parties concerned . Delay or sabotage on his part would be viewed as an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner Van Vliet de Jonge , whose image in full color now flashed on the screen . . . . As he sat on the floor , fiddling with the knobs , they saw him chattingwith the Queen at the opening of Parliament ; addressing a crowd , eating a herring at a street stall . Then came some still photos of his wife and their children , poor little tykes  --  it was a surprise to learn that he was married to a Javanese beauty , slender , with sloe eyes . Henk 's family vanished from the screen and were replaced by the Minister of Defense , a funny stiff old socialist , declaring that Her Majesty 's government , mindful of the human factor , was bending every effort to meet the conditionslaid down in the final demand : a helicopter of the Alouette II type was being dispatched , and a Lockheed Lodestarstood ready to receive the bundle of tapes . With a lastp264sweeping view of the farmhouse , the special broadcast ended . Further news and commentary would be shown on the regular program at eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of their prison faded from the screen , the Chadwickseyed each other . It looked indeed as though Senator Carey had known whereof he spoke when he said that making the tapes was not " the easy way out . " He had tried to warn Harold in particular against that fatal cocksureness of his . It had been foolish of Harold , foolish of all of them , to imagine that the " kapers , " as Henk called them , would not do everything in their power to keep the FBI from interfering with their plan . As for " stalling " over the delivery of the paintings ( " gaining time " ! ) , from what they had just heard such tactics could cost Henk his life . Harold might not care if Henk was executed , but the others would . He was such good company , their " Laughing Cavalier , " and he had a brilliant career ahead of him  --  they had not understood that till they saw him on television , though Charles had always said so . No wonder Harold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he had not been so brassily confident of the harmlessness of making the tapes , the others might have hesitated . And there sat Helen , the living proof of how wrong they had been to listen to him . Jeroen and Company  --  so far at least  --  had wreaked no vengeance on her . She had made a tape with instructions to turn over the Titian as the price of Henry 's head . That was all . No one had struck her or furiously twisted her arm . They had simply told her that they would be seeing her later . She had seemed almost let down when she came trotting back into the room . It was hard to believe that the band would give up on the Vermeer so easily ; they would surely try again . But two hours had passed , and no new summonshad come for her . If anyone had " gained time , " it was she . Of course they had other business to occupy them , most importantly the helicopter , which was due any minute if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostages in the parlor crowded against the western window to watch for it . In the dusk , they saw lanterns moving inp265the direction of the field . Nothing yet but a star  --  Venus rising  --  in the sky . " Watchman , tell us of the night , " someone hummed , as a " sick " joke surely , for it was not signs of promise such as had appeared to the Magi that they were awaiting  --  rather , the reverse in the collectors ' case . Still , one could not deny that there was something strangely thrilling in scanning the evening sky for the approach of a visitant from what seemed now like the other world . At any rate , it would be a break in the monotony . For some time , they had been hearing heavy thumps against the house wall : extra sandbags , the men said , being piled up around it in the event of an attack . At last Eloise 's sharp ears caught the sound of the helicopter 's rotors . There it was , hovering , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drop of the cable , but , disappointingly , the armed guards with lanterns patrolling cut off a view of the loading . Also it had become dark . They had only a glimpse of an indistinctobject swinging upward to tell them that the pick-up was over . The little craft with their voices aboard immediately started to climb . It was natural to feel despondent when it had disappeared . Only Harold , by bluster , avoided a sinking of spirits . He claimed not to feel that they had just said good-bye to their paintings  --  he still had faith in the FBI . According to him , the warning on television only meant that the FBI would have to be careful . They knew how to work under cover . If the Dutch tried to keep them out of the picture , they would have their own means . " Why , Maggie 's butler could be understudied by an FBI man and not even the other help the wiser . Half the waiters and butlers passing trays of drinks and sandwiches at your red-as-a-rose fund-raisers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey suits . If Gerry Ford knows what 's good for him , they 'll be careful . " He patted his trousers pocket , where , one presumed , his billfold lay . The ladies sighed . How far away the time seemed when they were wont to tell each other that Harold and his wife  --  the first one  --  were " deliciously common " ! Johnnie shook his head . " No , Harold , my boy . If the FBI getsp266into it , they 'll blow it . Sure as shooting . " " Even if it means some of our lives , " said Lily , sadly . " I 'm awfully afraid you 're right . It 's a terrible commentary , is n't it ? " " I never thought I 'd reach the point of looking on the FBI as my enemy , " declared Margaret . " It only needs a weensy change in perspective , does n't it ? " That was Charles , being dreadful again . " A little bird tells me that we 're not the enthusiasts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . It was that interesting third demand that brought it home to me . Why , my dear , I said to myself , if the whole criminal population of Holland were turned loose  --  every last cutthroat and child-molester and wife-beater  --  I 'd have no objection as long as it meant that I 'd be allowed to journey to Naqsh-i-Rustan with my ears and toes and fingers still safely about me . And since I 'm a rational animal and not totally selfish , I hope , I found myself led to question the social utility of prisons . What difference would it make , Charles , I said , if in fact those criminals were all let loose ? Very little , I concluded . Accepting such a prospect for my own subjective motives , rather than fearing it for society at large , allowed me to regard it objectively  --  a distinct gain , I always think . Till today , I confess , I 'd tended to look on our penal institutions as a necessary evil . And , as for the second demand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Holland were to leave NATO and suspend relations with Israel ? My own answer , I admit , would be prejudiced . As a pacifist , I hold no brief for NATO , and , though I 'm not unsympathetic to Israel , I feel she could use a little lesson . " " Oh , poor Israel , " moaned Beryl 's " Simmie . " " Would you take away her last friend ? Well , I guess I would , if it was the only way of saving our lives . And you have to admit that some of her policies are open to criticism . " " You see ? " crowed Charles . He was right , one had to acknowledge : things did look different from a captive 's point of view . One 's dearest principles shrank in importance when weighed against one 's freedom , till finally one began to ask whether they were so important , afterp267all . Take the example of NATO : would Harold be such a jingo about the NATO forces as the first line of defense against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all go home in peace ? France , come to think of it , he might tell himself , had left NATO years ago and the world had not come to an end . " Yes , " said Simmie . " And I 'm starting to wonder about something else . Our famous free press . I know it 's good that we have it and vital to a democracy . But in connection with your pictures , I ask myself . . . I mean , what 's to stop reportersfrom interviewing all our families ? " " Nothing , " said Carey . " We can be sure that it 's been done . " " Well , then , when this tapes bombshell breaks , wo n't they be pounding at those same doors again ? " Carey nodded . " Mmm . . . I take your meaning . " But the others were left in the dark . " Explain , " said Beryl . " Do n't be so damned mysterious . " " No mystery , " said Carey . " Aileen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door in their faces . " " Yes . On the one hand , my Mamma will let them in and tell them that , no , she has n't receivedany tape from me . They 're bound to believe her . Mamma 's a very truthful person . Anyway , in a small town like Fayetteville , everybody would know if she had . The same with your daughter , Jim . They 'd seek her out in college , and she 'd talk to them , would n't she , and tell them no tape ? It would be like that with every one of our families , but with you people 's it would n't . They 'd refuse to see reporters for fear of saying something out of turn . So it would be easy to narrow it down and know who 'd got a tape and who had n't . Then it would n't take a genius to realize that every hostage who made a tape was an important art collector . " " Or just rich , Aileen , " said Warren . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then fell silent , as if the interruption had confused her . " In any case , " said the Senator , helping her , " thanks to the press , the FBI wo n't have much of a problem running down the addressees of the tapes . The reporters lying in wait outside the stately homes will function as pointer dogs.  |p268As  for watching the families ' movements , noting visitors , photographingthem , trailing them , the press 'll provide those services for Kelley 's cops at no extra charge . " The collectors groaned in unison . The families had a right to their privacy in circumstances like this . Though no one , of course , wanted his works of art to be handed over to the kapers ' accomplices , the thought that the press by its vigilance would stand in the way was very disagreeable . If one was willing to pay the ransom , that should be the end of it ; press and governmentshould stand aside till the deed was done . Granted , it was breaking the law , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that great wealth , even relatively great wealth , got one in the habit of wanting one 's own way , whatever the cost . Yet it was not an altogether bad habit to have formed . They were right to feel their hackles rise at the very idea of arbitrary interference in an affair that concerned no one but themselves . The paintings were theirs , so they should be free to dispose of them according to their own lights . Obviously , owning a masterpiece was a sacred trust  --  they all felt that , even Eloise with her pretty-pretty Laurencins  --  but how that trust should be regarded in an emergency ought to lie between one and one 's own conscience . If the rich were staunch Republicans , that was not because they grudged a fair wage and decent medical care and playgrounds and the rest of it to the poor , nor even because they believed blindly in capitalism as the best system yet invented for creating wealth and spreading it to the workman and the small investor , but because they were accustomed to freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government and the prying press . A poor man did not appreciate the value of freedom , never having had much ; that was a sad fact and often not his fault . Yet if one could not help waxing indignant at the prospect of reporters wantonly interfering with one 's right to pay up , in another part of one 's mind was a little prayer that some outside force  --  not necessarily reporters  --  would intervene to save the treasures that too weakly one had agreed to sacrifice.  |p269Nobody  knew what he or she wanted , really . For the kapers to have their way or not to have it ? If they had their way , that would put an end to the torment at any rate . But to see them thwarted , gnashing their teeth like the villains they were , had greater appeal to the fancy . Rescue , realistically , was the only hope . Of their own accord , the terrorists would not " go away , " like a bad dream . A daring raid , under cover of darkness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party had been counting on the helicopter for deliverance : it had been tempting to picture a body of paratroopersspringing from it heavily armed , overpowering the guards and calling on the leaders to come out of the house and surrender . Such had been his fond fancy , Johnnie confessed ; others had imagined canisters of a paralyzing gas as well . But here again did one really desire that ? The house was wired , all the way to the rafters , and these people were fanatics . At the very minimum , were a rescue force to land , there would be shooting . The hostages , one might argue , could lie on the floor , out of the line of fire . But there was that " human shield " tactic so familiar from thriller films . To think of one 's frail body serving as a buckler for Jeroen 's hefty frame made one recognizehow inseparable one 's interests had become from theirs , bound up together despite the evident differences for as long as this lasted ; there was a name for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter appeared , it had been a relief , on the whole , to see that it was much too small to carry an army of flying Dutchmen  --  only the pilot and maybe one passenger could fit into it . " Sophie , " said Johnnie , " you 're a journalist . What bright idea do you have for calling the pack off so that our families can do the necessary , if that seems best to them , to bring us back alive ? " " The press is n't as unfeeling as you all seem to think , " she answered in a low voice , interlacing her long fingers . " On its own , it can behave responsibly when it sees that the public 's right to know ' conflicts with military security or with the safety of individual lives . But it does n't like to be dictated to or hear from others what its bounden duty is . Itp270might help now , I guess , if an appeal was made to the papers to leave the families alone while negotiations are going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie ? " asked Lily . " The Dutch , I suppose , " said Sophie . " Through the military attache . " But she herself did not sound very convinced . " Surely it would come better from the families ? " Margaret said . Probably it would , but how convey the idea to the families ? They might think of it for themselves and they might not . There was a dejected silence . " We 're so helpless , are n't we ? " sighed Eloise . " If only , over there , they could have the benefit of the thinking we 're doing here . We could give them so many pointers . " " I have an idea ! " Aileen cried . " Why do n't you make the appeal to the press yourselves ? You could do another tape , with all your voices on it . " They all turned to Carey . " Go ahead , " he said . " I 'm sure Jeroen et al . will be happy to air it for you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you mean we should n't ? " " Suit yourselves , Lily , " he answered . " But why so eager to make sure that our hosts get their hands on your pictures ? Looks like you want to do their job for them . Kind of an auxiliary fire-fighting team of volunteers standing by with hook and ladder , getting your piece of the action . " " But would an appeal work ? " said Johnnie . Carey supposed it would , for the time being , with the big papers , till some small fry broke the embargo . Aileen burst in . " I 've got a better idea . Sophie should do it . " " Thanks , " said Sophie dryly . " As a journalist you 'll carry much more conviction , " Aileen persisted . " Your colleagueswill listen to you when they might not to a lot of millionaires . The voice of privilege is n't their favorite music . But as a fellow-worker , you 'll speak directly to their professional consciences . " But Sophie refused , point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop ? " The old man started . He had not been paying attention . " Do what , my dear ? " His ruddy face had a purplish flush . Come to think of it , he had not been looking well since lunch time . " Make an appeal to the press , honey  --  " " Press ? " He stared around the room . " Are there reportershere ? " Sweat broke out on his broad forehead . " Hold it , Aileen , " ordered the Senator , when he saw that her mouth wasp271open , ready to speak again . He moved over to where Gus was sitting and took his pulse . Then his eyebrows went up . " Get Denise . " He was unbuttoning the old man 's shirt collar . " Is that better ? Can you hear me , Gus ? " The Bishop faintly nodded and tried to speak . His jaw worked . " Head . " " Your head hurts , does it ? " There was a feebler motion of the head and a facial sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring . He was having a stroke . As he twitched and fell forward , Frank caught him . " Shall we get him onto the sofa ? " " Maybe better not move him , " said Harold , joining himself to the purposeful circle around the sick old man . " Let 's just take off his shoes . " They unlaced the heavy brogues , and Frank chafed his feet in the thick socks . The right foot hung down , a dead weight . " Stand back ! " Denise was there now ; she had been in the kitchen preparing supper . Having taken his pulse herself , she said it would be all right to move him , and Frank and Jim , with Harold helping , carried him to the sofa . He was breathing wheezily and seemed to be unconscious . Harold looked over the contents of Denise 's first-aid kit and made a face . They had nearly forgotten that he had started out behind the counter , as a pharmacist  --  he had made his first million by " cornering " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ? " he demanded . " I fear so , sir . Would you think to try the adrenalin ? " " Are you crazy , woman ? The worst thing you could give him . This is a stroke , see ? " " There are medicaments in the frigidaire , sir . " " Blood plasma , yes , plenty , " said Ahmed , who had been hoveringabout anxiously . " Voulez-vous que j'en cherche ? " Harold hooted . " Counter-indicated , I should imagine , Ahmed , " put in Charles . " In my young years , I recall , blood-letting was a favored remedy for apoplectic strokes . Yes , I can still see the jar of leeches in Grandfather 's sick chamber . We were in Seville , as it happened , when he was stricken while watching a procession of flagellants . " Harold nodded . " Blood-letting would have taken the blood pressure down , which is what you have to do with a stroke . Adrenalin and plasma send it up . " " And icebags , " Charles continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be improvised , I wonder ? " Denise thought it could and hurried off to the kitchen . Harold went back to studying the bottles and boxes in the first-aid kit . " Aspirin , anyway , " he said . " May help some in dilating the veins . At least it 'll relieve the headache . You heard him indicate that his head was aching ? Normal in a stroke . Often the first symptom . Glucose  --  could there be any glucose in that frigidaire ? But , hell , you 'd have to administer it as an intravenous drip . No chance of that . In the old days they went in for camphor injections . . . . " He had not stopped talking , thinking aloud evidently , when Greet appeared . She studied the Bishop , whose breathing was still noisy , and calmly removed his false teeth . Next she took his pulse . " You should raise his head and shoulders , " she commented , letting his wrist drop . She had been an airline stewardessherself  --  KLM ; trust Beryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor with manifest dissatisfaction till it fell on the big Bible with its silver locks . " That will do , " she decided . " Place it there , under the shoulders , and you , Pastor , add your coat . " She showed Frank how to fold it . " Can he be flown out ? " he asked , when his friend had been propped up in what to the layman appeared a rather uncomfortable position . But no doubt Greet knew what she was doing . One could not call her attitude kind , but it did seem very professional . KLM must give them more training than Air France did in handling emergencies . Or could she have taken a nursing course to prepareherself for enlisting in their " people 's army " ? " This man can not be moved yet . When he recovers consciousness , we will see . " In her opinion , it was only a mild stroke . He was not in deep coma , and his pulse was better . In any case , he could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . If Gus were flown out , what lucky person would be chosen to go with him ? Frank was the logical selection , but , as Sophie had said yesterday  --  or was it only this morning ?  --  that was not how these people 's minds worked . The one thing you could wager on was that there would be no call for volunteers.  |p273Harold  held up a little ampoule . At last he had found something that interested him in Denise 's kit . " Papaverine . Well , well . " Greet took the glass container from him and inspected it herself . " A vaso-dilator , " Harold told her . " Just what the doctor ordered . Miracle that she 's got it . And of course she has the hypodermic . " Greet dismissed his notion of a miracle . Papaverine , she said , was often found in flight emergency kits ; it was to be doubted , though , that it was much more useful than aspirin for dilating the vessels . But she agreed that they should try it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , I think , is capable of giving an intramuscular injection . " But there was only the one ampoule , and if Denise bungled the shot , it would be a great pity . Greet watched her busy herself with the syringe and a little bottle of alcohol . " No . Go to the kitchen and boil some water . I will give the injection myself . " When the hypodermic was brought back in a pan of water , with a pair of tongs , she filled it . " Now turn him on his side and bring the trousers down . " The Bishop 's trousers were lowered , and his capacious underpants and flowing shirt-tail moved to one side , exposing his white buttock  --  the right one . Greet pressed his ancient flesh firmly between her thumb and forefinger and plunged the needle in . Then he was placed on his back again , with his trousers rebuttoned . Thanks to Denise'sbutter-fingers , there had been no avoiding a glimpse of his private parts . Greet stood looking down at him for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his passport that the age of this man is eighty-three years . Were you unaware , Pastor , that he suffered from high blood pressure ? Why have you brought him with you on your fact-finding ' crusade ? He should be in a home for the aged . " She turned on her heel and strode out . " We will be giving you the icebag you have asked for . " Not many minutes later , the Bishop stirred . He was conscious and could talk a little , though his speech was impaired . That might be because of the missing dentures , the lack of which he noticed , asking querulously what Frank had done with them . Frank fitted them into the poor old mouth , which drooped onp274one side so that saliva ran out . The whole right side of his face seemed to be paralyzed , and his speech , though improved , was still thick . At first he did not know where he was and recognized only Frank . Gradually he took in a bit more of his surroundings . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded that it be taken away . Yet he knew it was Calvin'sBible , which showed that he was becoming less confused . His color was better , and he was able to swallow some of the liquids Denise fed him , holding his head up like a baby 's . He complained of a " fierce " headache  --  a normal sequela , Harold said  --  and they brought him aspirin and a plastic sack with icecubesin it . By night-time , he was almost himself again . They had moved him to the other sofa , in the family room , where he could watch television , which he followed remarkably well , considering that he seemed to have grown deafer in the last few hours and that his right eye , now blinking occasionally , was teary . The screen showed the helicopter , landing at a military airfield , and a crowd of reporters being held back by the military police . To the general surprise , he remembered about the tapes and about Helen , too . " Here you are , big as life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prayer . " They were not shown the departure of the Lodestar , if in fact it had actually left . But they saw the Minister of Defense again and clapped for him , like an old friend . When bedtime came , Gus was tucked in for the night on the family-room sofa . They found his pajamas in his old tapestry carryall and put them on him . It was quite an event for one of their number to retire in proper night clothes , rather than fully dressed . Carlos brought him his own blanket and a pillow . Insteadof going to the attic , Denise was to sleep at his feet , with Frank next to her . Just before " lights out , " Elfride came in with a warm drink with a sedative in it . Horst had looked in for a minute , and all three Arabs had appeared to wish the old man a good night . Only Jeroen , in all this time , had not showed his face . It was his conscience reproaching him , Frank was sure . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pep "  |p275now  that the Bishop was out of the woods , as he put it . Gus 's stroke , he believed , was going to prove to be the blessed turning-pointin this whole adventure . God 's grace worked in mysteriousways , and He may have seen fit to try His servant with a little syncope in order to show these young anarchists the human havoc they could wreak through over-immersion in theory . " Over-immersion " was a funny way of putting it . At any rate , Gus 's own heart was touched by the attentions paid him . " You 've been so good , " he kept repeating in his still quavery voice to everyone who approached him . Well , he was a Christian and supposed to love his enemies , which meant seeingthe good in them . In view of that , the others decided not to mention in his presence the little thing that had just happened : a few minutes ago , Helen was turned back as she was mounting the stairway clutching as usual her rubberized dressing-case to freshen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revoked . She could go outdoors with the men , Hussein told her , barring the way with the submachine gun he had taken over from Ahmed . In the shock of it , she had said no , she would n't , withoutconsidering her waterworks or the fact that it was dark outside so that no one would see her . Now it was too late . The single chamber-pot in the house had been placed where the Bishop could use it , and she would not want to do tinkle-tinkle and disturb him . Thursday was nearly over . Twenty-four hours had gone by since the Bishop 's " attaque , " as Aileen persisted in calling it  --  she had been talking French a mile a minute with Denise and Jean , the steward . There was no news yet on television , and the radio report was only that " negotiations " were proceeding through the Dutch Embassy in Washington . But on the scene there had been some changes  --  for the better , on the whole . Groups of hostages had been allowed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the house . Only Helen had been kept in , as a punishment , and Gus , on " doctor 's orders "  --  he had taken a few , remarkably spry steps in the family room , refusingFrank 's arm , but then had been made to rest.  |p276Outside  , since morning , a new sight had met their eyes : a cordon of special police in black uniforms with white braid around the neck drawn up in the fields perhaps five hundred yards off . They were an elite force , Henk said , called the marechaussee  --  something like guardsmen  --  and were used in state emergencies . According to Ahmed , the people 's army had agreed to having them drawn up there , for its own protection . No sooner had the news gone on the air than curiosity-seekers had swarmed into the area . Last night the highway police had set up road blocks ; the only cars permitted through belonged to people who lived here or worked in the pumping-station . But that had not stopped polder dwellers and pump men from hiking cross-country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partly , that the guardsmen had been brought in . A warning had gone out , too , against violating the air space immediately overhead . Yet the hostages on their walks today had seen civilian planes and a civilian helicopter . Most of them , Henk thought , had been chartered by the press and foreign television chains , but a few , surely , were taking tourists up for a spin over the area at so many guilders a head . It would not surprise him if a balloon were to appear . In fact , just before dusk , one group of hostages saw a glider . That was Holland , he explained ; his countrymen were bound to turn the event into a carnival , with local-color touches . On the military 's list of problems would be an invasion of skaters along the canals . Every one of those aircraft carried photographers , one suspected . Frank , who had been allowed to bring his field glasses out with him , was sure he had caught sight of a telescopic lens pointing down at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being photographed by dozens of perfect strangers as one stumbled and slipped along the ruts of frozen fields with one 's casual travel clothes looking decidedly the worse for wear . The deterioration of one 's appearance was one of the crosses of captivity that one had to bear with equanimity . They were all in the same boat , luckily , and yet , unluckily , not quite . The men 's beards , for instance , grew at different speeds and somep277were coarser and spikier than others : Charles proved to be virtuallyhairless in the face except for his eyebrows , while Harold 's jaw bristled with a thick pepper-and-salt stubble . Moreover , one had only to look at the men to realize how favored women were in comparison . Even there , though , there were degrees . Eloise , with her mirror and tweezers , managed to be impeccable , while Helen was a sight . She had had an " accident , " poor dear , during the night , which had left a large spot that still showed , even when it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all morning she had smelled of urine . One 's olfactories could not help noticing , either , that Sophie was menstruating ; being older , in these close quarters , had its compensations . The close quarters meant , too , that every little imperfectionshowed up as if in a magnifying mirror : the gray roots , for example , at the parting of Aileen 's hair , a stye Beryl was getting , the boil on Victor 's neck . All were rumpled , and soiled as to collars and cuffs , though , again , not equally . Some looked " as if they had slept in their clothes , " as of course everyone had , but a few were fortunate in the materials they had happened to be wearing . Henry 's vintage herringbone seemed to be made of iron , and , until he had been stricken , the Bishop 's tweeds had not showed a wrinkle or a spot . Henk 's whipcord , too , was very wrinkle-resistant . As for Carey , he revealed his vanity every single night by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crease  --  like an actor on the road , he said  --  in his shorts and covered with his overcoat : he slid them under the rug , where they served as a mattress as well . No gentleman born could have done that . The black-and-white marechaussee had field glasses , which they trained on the prisoners and their guards at exercise . To them , the differences in grooming and cleanliness so apparent to the hostages themselves were probably not visible . They would all look the same . But the guardsmen were less interested probably in the presentability of the hostages than in their health and morale , which would appear to be good . If the uniformed men knew the number of the hostages and could count , they might notice that two had not been taken out for an airing andp278report that to their superiors . But through their field glasses they might see , too , that relations between guards and prisoners were far from ferocious ; perhaps in order to leave that impression , the amiable ones  --  Carlos and Ahmed  --  had been chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . Inside the house , too , the atmosphere had lightened , leading one to wonderas to what could be the reason . Frank 's theory that Gus 's stroke had produced a change of heart had not won many converts ; it was so obviously what a minister would like to believe . During the commotion caused by the stroke , the idea of appealing to the press had been allowed to drop . This morning Aileen had tried to revive it , but she had been unable to compete with the distractions furnished by the cordon of guardsmen , the fresh air and exercise , and the continuing sideshow of airbornephotographers and sightseers . With all these fresh sources of interest immediately at hand , they did not have time to worry about what might be happening in Washington and New York . Anyway , asking the press to stay away in a big countrylike America would be utterly futile if in a little country like Holland the authorities themselves could not do better than this afternoon 's spectacle suggested . Far from being considerateof others ' misfortune , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batten on it . This was borne out by the evening news . On the screen they were shown the line of men in uniform , the barriers across the highway , and , behind the barriers  --  what they would not have suspected  --  a throng of cars , bicycles , small trucks , and pedestrians . Merchants were selling smoked eels and herring from booths on wheels to the crowd , and , despite the temperature , there was an ice-cream vendor with cones and Eskimo pies . Some schoolchildren were flying a kite with a long tail . A reporterwith a notebook jumped the barrier , and they watched the police chase him and capture him . On the canal next to the highway there were skaters , sure enough , in bright caps and scarves , that the police had to turn back too . It was like a nationalholiday . " The kermis , " said Henk . This day had seemed the shortest of any they had spent inp279captivity . There had been no further mention of flying Gus out . That thought had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press . Gus himself did not want to hear of it . " I feel a power of good in me , Frankie , " he said firmly , meaning  --  one gathered  --  that he had been filled with the spirit during his close encounter with the other world and intended to remain among them as the vessel of it . The staunch old soul must believe that the power of good stored up in him could move mountains . For supper , there were pannekoeken  --  pancakes ; Denise had made them as a surprise out of a mix she found in the housewife'slarder and fresh eggs from the chicken coop . After supper , there were two " tables " of bridge , played with new cards John and Beryl had cut out and colored , using the children 's crayons  --  the court cards , very amusing , had single eyes and two noses like Picassos . The match game Carey had showed Victor had caught on with some of the others , and a whole circle was concentrating on it . It was more of a puzzle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing missionaries , and the idea was to ferry them across a river in a boat that held two persons . The cannibals could never outnumber the missionaries at any stage , on one river bank or the other , or the missionaries would be eaten ; all three missionaries knew how to row , and there was one rowing cannibal . Ahmed , who was on guard , came up to watch and suddenly put on a scowl . He decided that the game was racist . The real problem , he said , would be to keep the missionaries from enslaving the cannibals through the technology they brought with them , and the fact that the hostages had not seen that for themselves should show them how deeply racism was embedded in their culture . But , having recited his piece , the mercurial creature promptly came out of his sulk , took six matches  --  twisting the heads off of the ones that stood for missionaries  --  trotted them rapidly in pairs and singly back and forth across the rug , ending with two cannibals on the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had solved the puzzle ! Bravo for Ahmed ! " You 're the rowing cannibal , Ahmed , " the Senator told him ,  |p281which  was a risky kind of compliment . But the budding terroristwas pleased as Punch . Before long it was toilet-time . Yusuf came on guard and ordered Helen out with the men . By now she was used to the humiliation . Then lights out . They were all hoping to sleep , after their time in the open , breathing in pure air . But it was not to be . The group in the living-room had just settled down when the Bishop 's voice called for Frank . From the piteous sound of it they knew at once that something was wrong . They could hear Frank trying to comfort him . But it was not what they thought : Gus was not having a second stroke  --  he had forgotten the Lord 's Prayer . In comparison , that might appear unimportant , but to him of course it was everything . He sounded frightened out of his wits . Before going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prayers and all at once he could not remember how the Lord 's Prayer began . In the dark now Frank was prompting him . " Our Father . . . " " Our Father , " the old man repeated after him . But he could not go on by himself . " Who art in heaven . " " Who art in heaven . " " Hallowed be Thy name . " " Hallowed be Thy name . " It was terrible to listen to it . He broke off with a moan and must have put his hand to his head . " Does your head ache ? " " No . " He wanted to be left alone . There was silence , then he shouted in a terrible voice " My God , my God , why hast Thou forsaken me ? " Christ 's last words  --  awful . " There , now , you see , you remember that , " Frank said , in a horrible effort to put cheer in him . " The other will come back in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks . Often on the things we know best . " From the doorway Yusuf pointed his flashlight into the room . In its beam they saw Gus sitting upright in rumpled pajamas , his fringe of white hair awry . " No , Yusuf , " Frank said . " Turn it off , will you , please . We 're all right here . Just a little wakeful . " At last they heard the Bishop snoring , more wheezily than usual , but not enough , they decided , to send for Greet . During the night , he started up several times calling for " Rachel . " He seemed to be asking her , whoever she was , for something . " Where the mischief is it ? What have you done with it ? " Hep282was getting very excited . " What is it you 're looking for , Gus ? " Carey 's easy voice asked . He had come to sit by him , to spell Frank for a bit . " Ca n't remember . Whatever it was , she took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding things from me . " " His mind 's wandering , " said Frank . " No use hoping to sleep till he quiets down again . " " Tell her I need it . I have to have it now . I 'm too old to put up with her tricks . You never loved me , Rachel . Do n't you think I know that ? You only loved my love for you . " Then he fell to snoring again . " Oh , my goodness , " said Frank . " Do you think he really believed that all those years ? " " He had doubts , I suppose , " said Carey . " Being a religious man . But if she loved his love for her , she loved him . " " Is n't that a sophistry , Jim ? " Those nearest could not help listening ; it was curious how the word " love " made one prick up one 's ears even when one had passed the age for it . " But what about this whatever-it-is he thinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's talking about ? " " His faith , I should think . She took it away with her when she died , and he needs it to meet her in Heaven . " The sofa springs creaked . " That 's it ! " cried the Bishop , wide awake and chuckling . " Leave it to a Papist , eh , James ? You darned fool , Frankie . I ordained you and made a good liberal of you , but even God Almighty could n't make a spiritual man of you . " Some time during the night , the Bishop died . He must have gone quietly , for no one heard him . He was already getting cold when Frank touched his hand and knelt down to pray for him in the first light . There was nothing to do but wait for their captors to come down and take over . It would not be possible to bury him because the ground was partly frozen . Probably the best would be to have his body flown out . His friends could see to getting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were labors of love that , by giving them something to do , would help relieve their feelings . Surprisingly , Charles was weeping big tears . But the one closest to the Bishop was not as broken up as one would have thought : Frank merely blew his nose from time to time and shook his head . It was as if he were still shocked or bewildered by the statements Gus had madep283during the night . In view of those , it was just as well perhaps that the old man had not lingered ; he himself would not have wanted to live with his mind gone . And yet it was sad . At last Jeroen and Greet came in to look at the body . Yusuf had brought them the news , but the only sign of life from them for what seemed like ages was the squawking of their radio in the kitchen . Now that they were here , they were very inhuman in their attitude . They pulled back the blanket and carefully examined the body . Then Jeroen ordered Jean and Denise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let anyone help them and he did not want the body washed or shaved . Nor would he tell Frank whether they planned to announce the death soon  --  Frank was thinking of Gus 's relations . " In our own time and in our own way . You will see , " Jeroen replied and walked out . No one had had the courage to ask him what they were to do with the Bishop 's things or any of the dozen questions that came to mind . When the body was dressed and reverently laid on the sofa , Jeroen reappeared . " Sit him up , " he ordered . The coins Denise had placed on the Bishop 's eyelids fell to the floor . " Now open the eyes . " Impossible to imagine what the purpose of this could be . Were they going to take his picture ? The next thing they all knew they were being pushed into the parlor  --  Denise and Jean too . When the door was slammed on them , there was scarcely room to breathe . As they stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping into the plants , a rattle of gunfire came from behind the door . Then the door was opened , and they were allowed back into the next room  --  a privilege they could have done without . The Bishop 's body lay slumped forward on the sofa , riddled with bullets . Along his vest buttons were holes darkly oozing blood . Hussein was rechargingthe submachine gun . At a nod from Jeroen , Yusuf and Carlos carried the corpse out , dripping blood onto the rug . " Was he alive ? " shrieked Lily . Henk shook his head . " So you think a dead man has no blood in him ? " Jeroen said , with a peculiar satisfied smile . " Then why have you done this terrible thing , Jeroen ? " cried Frank in a voice of anger , which **33;6339;TOOLONG in his memory rejected the notion of Joe Mulder pottering off to bed at ten-thirty . He remembered too many Sundayswhen , making the most of their one day off , they had got up before six to go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lunched on a Brigham Street Pharmacy malted milk so thick it had to be eaten with a spoon  --  tractor oil , SAE 50  --  and gone on to the tennis club and played five or six sets , singles and doubles , and then separated briefly for dinner and a change of clothes , to meet again and go out on a double date that kept them up till two or three . It offended his image of Joe Mulder to think of him going to bed . That engine . It dawned on him that he was smelling the dark fume of lilacs . How exactly right ! At this house the lilacs would have been continuouslyin bloom since the day he had first climbed its steps . Following the fragrance , he stepped around the corner of the porch , and in the light from the side windows he saw the tapered cylinders of blossom lifting from among the crowded green hearts of the leaves . They were almost gone by . The top blossoms were browning , and only the shaded and protected ones were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the leaves and dragged his lungs full of the fragrance that preserved everything he once was . All at once he was uncomplicatedly eager to see Joe , and impatientat his own evasive delays . But as he turned to start up the steps and put his thumb to the bell button he was stopped by the question of what he would say if the door opened . The patterns of communication between him and Joe would be fossilized . They would have no common language except the jargonof an antique adolescence . He could n't imagine how he would greet his oldest friend . Remember me ? Coy . Joe , you old scissorbill ! Embarrassing , grotesque . Or pull the old trick , crouch down low , turn up the coat collar and the face , become an upward-peering dwarf so that the opener of the door , expecting someone at eye level , would have to jerk his glance downward to the gibbering thing at his feet ? Halloweenish , a shame to his gray hairs . Maybe just silence ? Stand there waiting for recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps he swervedp111off across silent lawn to the sidewalk , and went walking up the street as if he were not a visitor from a strange planet , or an Enoch Arden peeking in the windows of the past , but only a citizenout for a pre-bedtime stroll . His mind was busy with what might have been going on back at the house if he had had the nerve to push the doorbell . He finessed the greetings and exclamations and handshakes , and because he could n't quite visualize how Joe would have aged  --  his red hair would have gone rusty white , probably , and his Airedaleeyebrows would have grown bushier , but those details did n't make a picture  --  he transferred them all out onto the back lawn , where they sat in darkness in the warm wind , perhaps with sweating beer cans in their hands , with their minds turned backward . " You know , we grew up deprived , " Mason might say . " Prohibitionwas a terrible thing . We 've sat out on this lawn a lot of nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we wanted a beer we had to go down to Otto 's . " Joe makes a sound like gagging . " Ether beer ! " " Black home brew with a stick of ether in it , that 's right . It 's a wonder we lived . " Joe says , rumbling , " Remember the time Bailey drank milk and gasoline because somebody told him it was intoxicating ? " " My goodness , " says the faceless wife from her darkness . " Did n't it kill him ? " " You could n't kill Bailey with a drink . Anyway , I doubt he swallowed any . He was gagging before he got the glass up to his nose . " Casually he adds , " What ever became of Bailey ? He still around ? " " He 's around , raising as much hell as ever . " But that is not what he wants to hear . He backs up ; he rephrases the question . This time they do it right . " Dead , " they say . " Died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . End of story , end of grudge . All that Nature Boy vitality , all that uninhibited machismo , gone quiet . Lounge lizard , wild partier , reckless driver , cunt-hunter , farewell . " What is it about the Baileys ? " he hears himself say . " How do you account for their missionary spirit ? Is there joy in hell when some innocent is subverted ? Bailey was the worst companionp112you and I could have found , do you know that , Mulder ? Alcohol , cigarettes , women , speeding , drunken driving , the works . He reallywas a missionary , too . In Tongatabu he just had the wrong gospel forced on him . The church was n't his dish . But when it came to leading people into temptation he was a regular Dr. Livingstone . Nothing tickled him more than to baptize somebody . " In his dark chair Joe Mulder , hardly yet encountered , barely visualized , continues to rumble with laughter . " Remember that radiator cap ? Bailey never got over it . You filled him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene from The Rake 's Progress : the three of them in the hot alley parking lot , about to climb into Bailey 's red bug . Bailey stops with one leg up , points , swears . " Some son of a bitch ! They look , and his radiator cap is missing . Promptly , unhesitatingly , Bruce Mason , sixteen and in the first flush of being in , skips to a Model T touring car parked in the corner , unscrews its radiator cap , and skips back . From up on the blanket-covered board laid across the gas tank for a seat , Bailey cheers . Then someone says , from the doorway of a store that backs onto the alley , " What the hell goes on ? " Angry young man in a rubberized apron , scowling in disbelief out into the glare . Bruce 's perception is instant and crystalline : the young man would be coming out , but there are three of them , and Joe is as big as a house . Support makes him impudent . He says to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was stealing yours to replace it . " The owner 's eyes bug in outrage , but he stays in the doorway . " Well , put it back , for Christ sake ! " " Right you are , " Bruce says , and puts it back . " O.K. ? " The young man watches with his head sunk down . Joe climbs into the bug . Bruce goes to its front end , nudges the crank in until it catches , hooks his finger into the choke wire , and leans his shoulderagainst the radiator 's beehive cells . Bailey retards the spark and pulls the gas lever hallway down . Bruce leans , lifts , jerks . One pull , and she starts . The young man in the doorway looks over his shoulder  --  someone is calling him from inside . Bruce waves and hops up beside Joe . Reluctantly , looking backward , the young man disappears . In a skip and a jump Bruce is back to his car . With the radiator cap in his hand he meets the bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce leaps up , they are gone . At the first corner Bailey stops and Bruce jumps out and screws the plug onto the radiator . Bailey pounds the wheel , delighted . " Nerve of a road agent , " he says . " Mason , by God , that beats me ! " " Bailey was catching , like smallpox , " Mason says into the rattle of cottonwood leaves . " I do n't take much pleasure in his memory . One thing I do remember with pleasure , though  --  the night you crammed him into the garbage can down at the club . " He hears his own steps in the quiet street , he is aware of the cars that pass , brightening trees and house fronts and throwing his shadow ahead of him down the sidewalk . The canyon breeze flows steadily against him , a strong breeze for all its mildness . It is dry , but fragrant with what it has blown past since emerging from the canyons : soaked lawns , sprinklers forgotten in flower beds and shrubbery , drives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream , that dry wind bearing moist odors blends into a contradictory and tantalizing taste , and he is savoringit even while he juggles and arranges that scene years back , on the same sort of summer night as this , but earlier , barely dusk : They have been playing late , and are just coming out of the heavy Virginia creeper shadows of the club . And here comes Murphy 's half-witted girl across the parking area . She is really helpless . Any male who speaks to her undoes her ; she ca n't do anything but roll her eyes and moo . Somebody , Murphy or somebodyelse , has already got her good and pregnant . She must be five or six months along . Almost every night she comes to the club like this , and Murphy , that little five-by-five who is always singing " 0 Sole Mio " or " La ci darem ' la mano " as he rolls the courts in the mornings , is given every evening renewed cause to sing . He will be very proud of that bastard when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now here comes this unwatched imbecile across the parkingarea , mooning along in no hurry through the dusk , and Bailey suddenly gets the idea that he 'd like to take her on . Never had a feeb , he says . And look , she 's already pregnant , no danger or anything . He begins to kid her . It starts as kidding . Thenp114Bruce and Joe find out he means it . He wants them to go back and keep Murphy occupied for ten or fifteen minutes while he takes this poor moron under the hedge . They laugh and refuse . He insists . They continue to refuse . He gets impatient . They try to drag him away , laughing . He will not budge , getting surly . That is when Joe suddenly folds him up and crams him into the garbage can . He comes out fighting , ready to kill Joe . Joe holds him off with one long arm until the girl gets tired of waiting and moons on into the club to see Murphy . " Bailey was the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce says to Joe 's shadow on the lawn . " He would have made a proper hero for Graham Greene . You and I are too square to get to heaven , but the Baileys are another matter . Only the real sinners give God any reason to exert Himself . No fun shooting tame hares . " " Speak for yourself , " Joe says . He has come to a place where Thirteenth East crosses the gully . The land falls away on the lower side into an unbuilt darknessthat rattles with moving cottonwood leaves . Simultaneously aware of where he is , and how familiar it is , and hanging back to continue that imaginary conversation on Joe 's back lawn , he feels how the whole disorderly unchronological past hovers just beyond the curtain of the present , attaching itself to any scent , sound , touch , or random word that will let it get back in . As a stronger gust rattles through the tops of the cottonwoods below him , he stops dead still to listen . Memory is instantly tangible , a thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the arms . In the moving shade he and his mother wait for his father . ( Where ? Somewhere in the Sun River valley near Great Falls ? Somewhere on the Frenchman or the Milk ? ) The horses , tied to the wheels , rustle for a last oat in the wagon box . On their backs the sweat marks have dried white under the harness . Dust is white in the cracks of the wagon , on the felloes and spokes of the wheels , in the furrowed bark of the trees . The hubs , where axle grease has been extruded , wear knobs of dust like luxuriant mold . The ground is pancaked with the dung of cattle that have dozed in this shade , and over ground , dust , dung , the litter ofp115fallen twigs , is drifted a snow of cottonwood fluff from burst seedballs . When a sudden wind swarms through the grove , every leaf of every tree spins and rattles , accentuating the stillness that is not stillness at all , but a medley of dry sounds : crackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doves , and through it , over it , around it , encompassing it , the tap and clatter of cottonwood leaves . He does n't know what he and his mother are doing there , he only knows that they wait , patient or imprisonedor entranced , immobilized in afternoon . When he looks up , the sun glints through at him off the varnished faces of thousandsof heart-shaped reflectors , and beyond the dancing leaves the sky is a high pure blue crossed by traveling fair-weather clouds that darken and dissolvebecome a velvet night sky with a late moon loose in it . The sound of cottonwoods has never ceased . He is aware that behind him , where their bedroll is laid out , the grove is deep black below and afire with cool shimmering light up where the wind stirs the high leaves . But he is not looking at the grove . He looks the other way , across the irrigation ditch , toward the peach orchard and the cliffs . Light like frost touches the high rim , and breaks up the face of the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matte shadow . It falls in ragged patches between the orchard trees , and glitters and passed and is renewed on the water of the ditch . On the other side , Nola stands up , rising out of the dark pool of her clothes , facing him , dusted and hazed with moonlight , glimmeringbut plainly seen . The night is soft against his skin , but he is shivering , his jaw locked as if by paralyzing cold . She takes a step and dips a foot in the water . A low laugh wells out of her . " Oh , it 's warm ! " her husky voice whispers . " Come on . " His shivering is so violent that at first he can not move . He hears it communicate itself to the gelatinous air , and shake through the air into the tops of the cottonwoods and vibrate there , the very voice of his awe and worship and desireThe vision breaks and tears , dissolving . Below him the trees rattle and are still . Mason feels around in his mind like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Thep116web of associations , the dense entangled feelings , are still , after an absence of two thirds of a lifetime , as intensely there as a rattlesnakeunder a bush . Not the girl herself ; she is no more to him than a rueful shrug . But the associations , the sights and sounds and smells that accompanied her , the vivid sensuousness of that time of his life , the romantic readiness , the emotions as responsiveas wind chimes  --  those he does miss . Listen to those cottonwoods talking , he says to the two he left behind on the dark lawn . Does n't that sound tell you , as much as any single signal in your life , who you are ? Does n't it smell of sage and rabbit brush and shad scale ? Does n't it have the feel of wet red ditch-bank sand in it , and the stir of a thunderstorm coming up over one of the little Mormon towns down in the plateaus ? Just now , for a half second , it drowned me in associations and sensations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . When cottonwoods have been rattling at you all through your childhood , they mean home . I could have spent fifty years listening to the shamal thresh the palms in the date gardens of Hofuf , and never felt anything but out of place . But one puff of wind through those trees in the gully is enough to tell me , not that I have come home , but that I never left . Having let it surge through his head like the wind through the branches , he takes it back . He could never say any such thing to Joe , much less to Joe 's unknown listening wife . And yet there is something he wants to say . He tries again . " Do you know how privileged you are ? " he asks them . " Are you properly grateful to be living in Paradise ? " They protest , naturally . It is their belief that his life has been filled with exotic adventures and that theirs is restricted and provincial . That is one of the reasons he is only imagining himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person : he hates the thought of being treated , by Joe , as The Ambassador , a visiting Distinction . That would only exaggerate the changes and the differences and the losses of forty-five years . But Paradise . Their incredulity makes him insist . He feels that quiet back lawn as a green sanctuary full of a remote peace . " Paradise is an Arab idea , " he says . " Semitic , anyway . It 's a garden , always a garden . They put a wall around it because that 's how their minds work , they 're inward-turning , not outward-turn/ing . Paradise is safe , not exciting . Like this . Change the mockingbirdsin that gully into bulbul birds , and put up a wall , and you 'd have it : water , greenness , coolness , peace , and all around you the desert . The Mormons are all mixed up about heaven , their right hand does n't know what their left is doing . The Book of Mormon makes heaven into a sort of New Jerusalem , with gold-paved streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mormon heaven was made by hand , and it 's this , it 's an oasis in the desert . " He can not tell whether they accept what he says or whether they are only being polite to the ex-ambassador , an old friend . The scene fades , frays , is lost . A car coming along Thirteenth East exposes him where he stands looking down into the moving tops of the gully trees . His shadow rotates , floats outward , stretches , dissolves . For a second or two the car occupies all the silence , the whole inside of his head . Then its noise dwindles and the night and his head are whole again . He turns back . Most of the houses along the street are dark . It must be eleven or after . A vague frustration grows in him  --  at the hour , at the fact that the two back there on the lawn can not understand what he is trying to tell them , at the impossibility of going back there in person at all . How will he get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can he say to Joe , outright , What did happen ? Did Bailey and Nola stay together ? When I was here for my father 's funeral you said their singing act had broken up , and you thought they had , too . But if she did n't marry Bailey , whom did she marry ? Where 's she living ? What happened to her ? He would not admit that much interest in her , either to Joe or to himself . But he admits curiosity . That intense obsessed involvement , and then absence , silence . She managed to remain mysterious ; he would like to know about her , but he ca n't imagineasking . Neither can he imagine trying to explain to Joe why in forty-five years he never wrote a single letter . He was the one with the unstable address ; he should have given Joe a chance to keep in touch . Later , much later , he might have read about Mason in the newspapers or got him with his breakfast orange juice on the " Today " show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce Mason , what he looks like , how he has spent hisp118life . But by the time that information might have been available , it would have been far too late for Joe to write . Pride would have intervened . I 'll write the bugger when he writes me . So now if Mason goes up on that porch and rings the doorbell and startles them out of their bedtime preparations  --  her hair in curlers , Joe 's teeth in a glass  --  in what role does he appear ? Is he the Diplomat or is he the bootlegger 's boy ? It is impossible , not because he fears Joe but because he fears time , change , himself . After so long a silence , his slightest word , the answer to the simplest question , may strike Joe as being the word of a man who went away and forgot all his old friends and now comes back dropping names , parading himself rich and famous , as it may seem to them , around his home town . Tomorrow it may be easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to the strangeness of the once-familiar . After the funeral tomorrow he will call them , take them to lunch , spend the afternoonreaching back to what , however it may seem from his actions , means the most to him in this place . He cuts across the parking strip to his car , and in the empty street , a street that stares like an Utrillo , makes a U turn and starts back toward the hotel.  |p119The  canyon breeze had died , the trees were still , the street lay out before him , not simply empty , but blurred and ambiguous , a double exposure , and he felt bewildered , in the strict sense , half lost in a half-remembered wilderness , beguiled by **25;6374;TOOLONG as he had been when a boy prowling the willow bottoms of the Whitemud , following the destinationless and overgrown paths that cattle had pushed through the brush . He clenched his eyes shut and opened them again to clear his vision , and the street came single again . But it was the street of the past , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallucination . Its trees overhung it with their known , late-at-night stillness , the arc lights blurred in the leaves and cast puddles of inert dusty light on sidewalks and parking strips and the angles of curbs . He had just dropped Joe off after a date , and was turning home . The tiredness of a long day and night had softened his bones . He yawned a jaw-cracking yawn : he had not slept since 1931 . Slouched in the seat , scratchy-eyed , doped with drowsiness , he let the car find its own way like an old buggy horse . Not surprisingly , it took him home , and by ways as familiar as the faces of the dreamed-of dead , past East High School 's grayp120barracks , site of all his subsequent flight-pursuit , corridor-and stairway , forgotten-examination nightmares ; past the lunch shack , plastered with Camel and Coca-Cola signs , where they used to lunch on hot dogs and root beer , and where older boys , Chet among them , bought forbidden cigarettes and stood on the firing line just off the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Below the lawn , spread along the fossil beach terrace of the lake that thousands of years ago filled the valley , was a long hanging darkness , the playing field where in paleozoic gym-class softball games he had patrolled an invariable , contemptuous right field and batted ninth . Below that , the slope fell away to the crisscrossed lighted streets of the city , the bright bands of State Street and Redwood Road , the curving line of a new freeway , and far out , the darkness of the salt flats and the lake and the desert that reached to California . Up to the right , at the head of Main Street , the floodlighted Capitol stared whitely . Below it was the bloom of the business district with the spiky floodlighted temple at its upper edge . Abruptly the capitol winked out . Its afterimage pulsed , a blue hole in the darkness , and before it had faded , the temple , too , went dark , cued to the same late clock . Something invisible but palpable , some recognition or reassurance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark loom of the Wasatch . In one enfolding instant , desert and mountains wrapped closer around the valley and around him their protective isolation . Seen and unseen , lighted and dark , it was all effortlessly present . Here was a living space once accepted and used , relied on without uncertainty or even awareness , security frozen like the expression on a face at the moment of a snapshot . This territory contained and limited a history , personal and social , in which he had once made himself at home . This was his place  --  first his problem , then his oyster , and now the museum or diorama where early versions of him were preserved . He felt its relationship to himself so strongly that he became defensive and resistant . It could n't be that he actually yearned backward to the limited life he had known in this place . For more than forty years he had lived where the world was most dangerous , at the uneasy edges where nations slid down or werep121heaved up like the earth 's plates in collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his own , and to problemsthe very reverse of personal . He had given his life , or most of it , to social and political Medicare , he had attended a thousandmeetings with his attache case full of Band-Aids . He had been not a person but a representative , interchangeable with other representatives , trained and disciplined toward imperturbabilityeven while being spat at for his color or for the flag on his fender , even while being driven through streets vicious with sniper fire . Yet here he had spent the whole afternoon and evening walking around the edges of this preserve of the memory , fascinated by images out of his immaturity and by the fragranceof lost possibility . He drew down his mouth , and like some Scott Fitzgerald answeringthe charge of writing about frivolous things , muttered the only excuse that came to him . Maybe it 's my subject matter . Maybe it 's what I really know . Remembered habit created remembered reality . His needle ran in a groove . At Seventh South he turned left down the hill , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppositethe last house where they had lived in Salt Lake City , the house of his postponed senior year in college , the duplex that was home when Nola was his girl , the happiest house , for a while , that the Masons ever had . The roofs of other houses jutted up along the side street where there had been empty lots before , but otherwise he saw no change . The cinder-brick duplex was still jacked up above the corner by a flight of cement steps . The basement garage still opened on the side street , an excellent arrangement for a man who had cars to unload and suitcases to deliver . A man with such a garage need not fear nosy neighbors . Unless memory was mistaken , during the year-plus-a-summer that they had lived here , his father had all but forgotten to be afraid of the law . He had made himself a place , he filled a need . Among the neighbors he passed for a traveling man . His trips were as routine as if he were making calls on hardware dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement behind a false wall of cupboards that Bruce had fixed up a basement apartment within fifteen feet ofp122the cache , and sometimes had friends in , without causing any anxiety . Caution had haunted all their other houses like the smell of drains . Here they breathed freely . They were like any other middle-class family . The 1929 crash happened while they lived here , and they never even noticed it . They had money in the bank and a Cadillac in the garage  --  one of those early models whose gas-tank pressure you had to pump up before you could start , the kind that for years afterward you saw around , indestructible , converted into hearses . In the vacant lot out behind , his father had made a vegetable garden , and could often be seen working along his rows of lettuce , beans , and corn , sweating contentedly and kidding the passersby who kidded him about working too hard . The people in the other half of the duplex  --  what name ? Albert Something , some French name  --  were quickly tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his father had a companion with whom to share a bottle of home brew on a hot afternoon , or a gin fizz on a late Sunday morning . They experimented together with kits for making wine out of black mission figs . They went deer hunting together in the Uintas . Contentment , of a kind , and for Bruce , too . This street where he paused , craning to look , was filled with memories of an easy belonging  --  smell of cured October leaves , sight and feel of frozenruts , sting of cold clean air when he shoveled off sidewalks and driveway after a snow , smells of growth in the spring , brightness of forsythia against the dark cinder brick of the house . He traced the flight of a spiraling football as he or someone else threw a long pass diagonally from sidewalk to sidewalk , testing his arm . The sound of his idling engine was the idling of LeGrande Benson 's new Studebaker , and they were sitting in it on a bright winter morning , the exhaust steaming into zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffing against their shins , the radio going softly , while LeGrande told him about his rookie season with the Chicago Bears . Bruce was full of respectful , amused astonishment that at two hundred and twenty pounds LeGrande had been found too light to play tackle , and had been converted into an end . He valued the reminiscences about Bronco Nagurski and Ernie Nevers ; up to that time , he hadp123known no one so familiar with greatness . Neither had he ever seen , until then , a car with a heater or one with a radio . This Benson , a pretty good friend of his who lived up the street , and with whom he had played club basketball , had made the giant stride out of their provincial rut . In a way that must have been deeply satisfying to him , Bruce provided the hometownaudience he required for the reciting of his adventures . But he did more for Bruce than Bruce did for him . Without envy , for it had not occurred to him that he , too , might someday take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Benson , prouder to be known . Felicity . Life without strain . And it was more than being acceptedon the block and living without fear . Something in their family relationships had eased , too . Chet had lived down the anger and disappointment he had both caused and felt . Now at twenty-two a married man of five years ' standing , trapped , his hopes put away or scaled down , he was living in Park City and playing baseball in summer , basketball in winter , for the SilverKing mine . Now and then he brought Laura and their infant daughter down and gave Bruce 's mother the joy of being Grandma . Nor was Harry Mason immune . Bruce remembered him proppingthe baby on the sofa and pushing a cushion into her face , knocking her backward when she struggled to sit up . " Tougheningher up , " he called it . He had played the same game with his own children . As with them , he never knew enough to quit when she was red and gurgling with laughter . He nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in baffled irritation he would hand her to her grandmother . At such moments , Bruce felt that he half understood him . He did not mean harm . He simply tested by teasing what was in a sense his , what he perhaps loved and felt responsibility for . The tests were such limited tests as he could conceive . They all failed to pass . In the end , so did he . Almost as much as Chet , Bruce had grown past his father 's obligation to make a man of him . They hardly saw one another for days at a time , for Bruce was at school or work all day and out more than half the nights . If his father grumbled about his tomcattingaround , he could challenge him , asking wherein he was failing . He was attending college , which nobody else in the fam/ily had ever come close to doing . He was making nearly straight A 's  --  and if he felt that he did n't deserve his grades , considering the amount of studying he did , he carefully kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while going to school and a sixty-hour week during vacations . He bought his own clothes , and had bought his own car . He had a bank account that approached a thousand dollars . In that last year of school , he was editing the literary magazine and reading papers for Bill Bennion and another professor friend  --  how , and during what free time , only God knew . Thanks to J. J. Mulder 's indulgence , he could arrange his work hours so as to play on the tennis team in the spring , and in tournaments during the summer . Though he did not point out this detail , either , his name was in the sports pages oftener than Chef s . He said , and believed , that the more he asked himself to do , the more he could do . His mother , who never got over thinking of him as sickly and frail , protested that he would ruin his health , and when he discovered that he had an ulcer , she thought she had made her point . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a young man 's disease , and would pass , and anyway were no hindrance to anything but his eating habits . His drinking habits he did not mention , and his smoking habits he did not change . Yet in a way she was right . Mason could not remember just when the ulcer had appeared . Perhaps he had had it for months before he finally took his dull bellyache to the doctor . But during the year or so of his greatest felicity and confidence , there it was , his personal bosom serpent . He supposed that retrospect should make more of it than he had made at the time . But then , at the end of the twenties , exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem smug . It would be falsifying memory to pretend that he was anything but arrogant and a prig . Except for the notes from underground that his ulcer sent him , he was brashly confident . He thought good times were forever . He assumed that his happiness was the product of his own excellence . His father used to eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Al , " he would say . Perhaps he shared some of his wife 's pride in their younger son , though he would have had no way of showing it , andp125though Bruce ( Mason admitted ) would probably have become totally insufferable if he had thought he had his father 's approval . And once the old man met Nola , Bruce heard no more about late hours . She broke him down like a dandelion stem . It was a queer , disquieting experience to watch the father whom he had feared , hated , and despaired of pleasing , show off before a girl  --  Bruce 's girl  --  like a sixteen-year-old . He had rolled almost past , and was already craning backward to see the corner and the dark house . But now he stepped down hard on the brake , for he did n't want to outrun what leaped into his mind , vivid and intact , cunningly lighted . He was improving on it , expanding it , preparing exposition and climax and denouement , even as it materialized . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already beginning to transform it from tableau to story . The year is 1930 , the season is spring , probably May . The time is evening , around eight-thirty . Though it is still light outside , it is beginning to be dusky in the house . In his dinner jacket , his breastplate of gleaming white , his smoky-pearl studs and cuff links , his Bond or Dart collar as prescribed by Jack Bailey , his hand-tied black butterfly bow , he comes into the bedroom where she lies reading . She lowers her magazine to take him in . Two weeks ago she had her left breast and all the lymph glands on that side removed , a radical mastectomy , and she is pale and thin . Her freckles show coppery across the bridge of her nose , her heavy sorrel hair is in a braid . Her eyes are always startling him  --  the brightest , clearest blue he ever saw in a human head . Her smile breaks out in pure pleasure . " Oh , you look nice ! " " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably do , at that . Except for your homely face , you 've got to be quite a handsome boy . " " Sez you . " " Sez me . " Sometimes , in spite of what he knows about her life and the things she has had to put up with , and despite the stoic look that lurks in her face whether she is sick or well , he feels her spirit as gay and playful as a girl 's . She brushes away her troubles , shep126makes scornful fun of illness and pain , she is resolutely cheerful even in the face of this operation , which scared Bruce 's father helpless , sickened Bruce , and must surely have frightened her . Right now , though she looks white and tired , a sassy sparkle lights up her eyes . He has an intimation of how game and pretty she must have been as a girl , and he knows that he is the one who brings this out in her . He is the apple of her eye . Across the footboard and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a big joke in common . " O.K. , " he says , accepting reality . " Who flutters pulses is me . " She reaches her left arm , stiff from the operation , the armpit tight with half-healed scars and adhesions , and turns the face of the Big Ben that ticks on her bed table . " Are you going with Joe ? " " No , he could n't get a date . " " You 're starting early , for you . " " I 'm on the committee . I ought to get down a little ahead of time to make sure everything 's O.K. By the time I pick up Nola and get to the hotel it 'll be nearly nine . " " Nola , Is she a new one ? " " Nola Gordon . No , not new  --  well , pretty new . I 've taken her out a couple times . She 's living with Holly . " " Is she pretty ? Do you like her ? " He rolls his eyes toward the ceiling and licks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Adores me . She 's putty in my hands . " An amused snort bursts out of her . " It sounds to me as if it was the other way around . " Looking him over with the little smile crinkling the corners of her eyes , she says , " Come here , let me fix your tie . " She sits up , and he bends over her . Because of her stiff arm , she ca n't quite reach , and he kneels on one knee so that she can tug the bow straight . Her face is within inches of his , intent on what she is doing . As she works , her robe falls open , and down the opening , in the V of flap drawn across bare ribs and held by red scars like claw marks . She sees that he has seen . Embarrassed , she pulls her robe around her and lies back . Grimacing , she says , " Do n't let it getp127too serious , too soon . You 've got too much ahead of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chet . " Or like me , she might have said . When she was Bruce 's age , twenty , she had been married for two years . " No danger , " he says lightly . They are both self-conscious and pretending not to be . " Try to get home early , " she says . " You never allow yourself enough sleep . " " Look who 's talking . " " I 'd sleep if I could , believe me . Anyway , I 'm not young any more , I do n't need as much sleep as you do . " " I 'll tell you what . I 'll promise to sleep as many hours tonight as you do . " They laugh , but he is vaguely uneasy , for he has felt , like the draft from a door standing open somewhere else in the house , how the stillness and darkness of empty rooms will close around her as soon as he leaves . The people next door  --  Marcotte , that 's the name  --  are away visiting their daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . It will be a long , ticking time till ten , and then till eleven , and then till midnight , and then till whateverhour , one or two or three , when his headlights will sweep across the ceiling as he turns in . Shifting blame that he ought to accept himself , he says , " I should think Pa could have waited till you were well before he made his trip . " " Ach , " she says . " Anybody dragging around the house makes him jumpy . He 's better off having something to do . " " That does n't mean you 're better off . " " I 'm just fine . " " Do n't get out of that bed . Tomorrow I 'm staying home all day and cleaning the place up and cooking you little custards and stuff . " " All right . You can baby me tomorrow . " " How do you feel ? Can I get you anything before I go ? " " No , no . You run along and give your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and leave you alone . " " Do n't be silly . I 'm fine . " " I 'll try to get in early , but I may have some committee businessafterwards . " This is a lie as ridiculous as hers about feeling fine . She knowsp128it , and is indulgent . He knows it , and is not pleased with himself . The only committee meeting he is likely to attend will be a committeeof two in a dark parked car . Her eyes , bright as blue turquoise , go narrow with the crinkling of her smile . She makes a show of snuggling her back comfortably into the pillows , and opens her magazine . He leans and kisses her cheekbone . " Good night . I 'll leave the light on in the living room . " " No need to waste electricity . " But he leaves it on anyway . It makes him feel better about leaving . Then he opens the door and emerges into the spring dusk . The air smells of mown lawns . His dancing pumps are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet touch grass twice , he is in the car . By the time he has turned the corner he has forgotten her , he is looking ahead , not back . Mason 's foot eases up on the brake and the car begins to roll . The route is precisely the one he would have taken that night in 193o  --  down to Tenth East , right on Tenth East to South Temple , down South Temple to the tower house and the hotel . When he passes E Street on the right , he looks for the old Brigham Street Pharmacy , once hangout and landmark , universally known among the young as the BSP . It has become a shabby branch bank . A block further down , he involuntarily slows as he approaches the house with the tower , as if he were indeed going to stop there , leap up lawn steps and porch steps and interior stairs as impetuously as he just now leaped from his porch , and arrive panting at the door where Nola in a party dress of green taffeta , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchid pinned to her waist , will open . She has a figure more womanly than Holly 's , not so pencil-thin , deeper-bosomed . Her shoulders , rising bare out of the stiff green silk , are smooth and golden . She is as full of promise as the spring night outside . He has never seen her dressed up like this . She takes his breath . " Oh , hey , beautiful ! " " You like it ? " She touches the orchid at her waist . " I never had an orchid . I had to try to live up to it . "  | " You make it look like some daisy out of a vacant lot . " He slides inside and reaches for her , but she shrinks away , laughing . " You 'll smear my war paint . " Relenting , she leans forward . He leans to meet her , and she gives him a soft , fluttering , puckered kiss as if she were kissing him through a hole in a curtain . Only their lips touch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom to get her wrap he takes out his handkerchief and wipes a faint red stain from his mouth . The sight of it on the clean folded cloth excites him . He sits down at the piano and bumps out a mechanical bass to " Twelfth Street Rag , " his total accomplishment on the piano besides " Chopsticks . " In the middle of it , the other bedroom door opens and Holly comes out , dressed for a date . " Well , hi . " " Hi , Holly . " " You 've got a new talent . " True . Nola has taught him those chords so that they can play something four hands . " No limit to my gifts , " he says . She makes him nervous . It has been two weeks since he asked her for a date . After that little outburst of hers , he just dwindled away , without quarrel or explanation . He does n't know how nonchalant or casual to be . Something about Holly 's upper lip makes her look as if she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting little things to rights , squats briefly to turn on the red lamp on the floor . Its light glows on the ceiling as if from a manhole down into a volcano . She lights a cigarette , and he smells menthol . Kools . " You 're going to the spring formal , I hear . " " Yes . Are you ? " Her amused glance takes him in from his satin-bow pumps to his wing collar . " I 'm going to a party at the country club with my boss . " " Ahal " " Yes , " she says . " Aha ! " Nola comes out with a brocade coolie coat over her shoulders , its arms hanging loose , and a gold evening bag in her hand . Even in high heels she manages to move like a barefoot woman . He sees Holly 's eyes stop on her for just a moment , a look asp130measuring as if she were about to sit down and draw her . Then she widens her look to include Bruce and makes a little wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . Freut euch des Lebens . " That is a motto he and she once adopted for themselves , when they were reading William Ellery Leonard 's Two Lives . Freut euch des Lebens . Live it up . " She does n't like me going out with you , " Nola says on the stairs . Bruce has had the same impression . Though it bothers him a little , nothing could inflate his self-esteem more . The chivalric code as it has leaked down to him and his crowd from Emily Post and other authorities is explicit about the openingof car doors , the help one should offer a lady in such matters as sitting down , the obligation of the escort to walk on the gutter side of the sidewalk , presumably to shield the lady from the splashing of possible mud and slush . There is no mud or slush this mild night , but he opens doors , holds elbows , makes sure all feet and skirts are inside before shutting . He is scrupulously on the gutter side from parking place to hotel entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her whispering skirts , slides in . Emerging behind her into the lobby , he sees that some student couples are already there , watched with interest by hotel guests sunk in lobby chairs and sofas . Who are all the beautiful young people ? He is whacked hard between the shoulder blades , and here is Jack Bailey , rank as a barrel in which Bourbon has been aged . His arm is hooked into the elbow of a swamp angel , a Moulin Rouge character so obvious in her inclinations and compliances that she might as well wear a satin band over her shoulder like an Atlantic City beauty contestant , saying Miss Willing . Jack introducesher : Muriel Something . He says to Nola with his burbling leer  --  he is the only person Bruce knows for whom words like " burble " and " leer " are unavoidable  --  " Been out on Redwood Road lately ? " She only looks at him . So does Muriel . Coldly . " Stay away from there with this guy , " Jack says . He raises his finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such word as no ! " Then , a magician patter-chorusing while he folds his hand/kerchief , he says , " They 're changing the name of Redwood Road , did you hear ? " " They are ? " Bruce says . " Why ? What to , " " Taylor Walk . " Jack raises his eyes up along his upward-pointingfinger and wahoos into the coffered ceiling of the Utah Hotel lobby . His girl snickers , gently chewing gum . Already drunk , Jack says , " Listen . Intermission . Room 244 . Eh ? " They leave him . They choose to walk up the broad steps to the mezzanine . He keeps falling out of his time machine . Instead of ushering a gorgeous girl in by the front entrance , he drives up to the side . The attendant comes out of his glass office and Mason turns the car over to him . The lobby , instead of boys in dinner jackets and girls in party gowns , shows only bellhops and two belated couples who have been doing whatever it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who are waiting in their denim leisure suits and Hamro slacks for the elevator . Instead of joining them , Mason , too , walks up the stairs to the mezzanine . Now it returns , now he is back there , for off to the right of the stairhead are the doors to the ballroom , where the orchestra will be arranging their chairs and wetting their reeds , and where other members of the committee will be talking to the assistant manager about dinner details or lighting , or making last-minute adjustments of the decorations ( red roses on white trellises , like a garden scene from a high school play ) . He goes to the doors and looks in . The past is not there , the present slaps him in the face . The big gaunt room is lighted only by orangey wall-bracket lamps whose bulbs are twisted to resemble candle flames . Folding chairs with mimeographed sheets scattered on or under them stand in broken rows where their occupants pushed them when they rose from whatever librarians ' or petroleum geologists ' or woolgrowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three water glasses , a pitcher , and a wilted microphone . The room is stagnant with dead speeches , rules of order , motions and seconds and amendments , treasurers ' reports . He does n't suppose it has been used for a dinnerdance in years . Dinner dances went out with the Model A.p132Yet if he narrows his eyes can make it swirl with colored motion , a Calder mobile . His senses venture out toward the throb of dance music , he sniffs girls as fragrant as tuberoses , the whiskey breath of a grinning undergraduate spinning his girl close reeks in his face . If Bruce Mason were with another girl , that breath might be his : he would have felt obligated to gargle . If the girl in his arms were another , say Olive Bramwell , he , too , might be charging around the ballroom like Crazy Horse surrounding Custer . But Nola has a calm that discourages boisterousness . Her dark piled hair among the shingle bobs and fresh marcels makes her seem more womanly than any girl in the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made for waltzes , slow fox-trots , circlings in uncrowded corners , long looks , murmured talk , seriousquestions , sober moments , upward smiles , communion . Her voice is husky , her laugh so warm and low that it makes the laughter of other girls sound like the cackling of hens . Already it seems to be intermission . The musicians are setting aside their instruments , the crowd is pressing toward the doors and the punch bowls on the mezzanine . Waiters have appeared with tables that they set up around the periphery of the floor . They whip white cloths over them , lay them with silver and glasses . But these two stand talking , unwilling to break . On the merest glance , he is younger than she  --  younger in years , younger in manner and self-command . He is blond where she is dark , his eyes are blue where hers are brown , he is thin and hyperactive by contrast with her composure , darkly tanned where she is golden . She makes a center , he orbits it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes , hands , body ; she listens . He whips around her as if she were egg and he spermatozoon . Utter opposites , they make a one : Yin and Yang . Their force field deflects intrusions . From the first note of the band until now , they have avoided trading a single dance . It is the first time they have gone out together to anything but a movie . They have still many things to discover about one another  --  where they come from , what they like , how they feel , what they hope to do . In six dances he has painted six self-portraits , summarized his twenty years , told about his friends and his job , carefully avoided saying anything about his family , in/vited her corroboration of his opinions of professors and courses , discovered that in the autumn quarter , before he knew her , he graded her papers in a Victorian poets class and gave her a C plus , determined to his brief disappointment that she has no interestin Hemingway , Proust , Joyce , Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead and that she was brought up by her father and several aunts on a ranch in Emery County . There at the ranch in Castle Valley , on the edge of the San Rafael Swell , she has a horse named Baldy , whom she pronounces Bally . Her eyes are full of light as she tells him about all-day rides into the Swell or up onto Ferron Mountain . She adores her brother , a rodeo rider , who once competed in bull riding and saddle bronc with boils on his behind . In return for this information he confides , since it is something she obviously respects , that he , too , is a sort of cowboy , having grown up in Saskatchewan and Montana . He sees that the crowd has left them , that they are standing alone , and says , " There 's booze up in 244 . You want to go up ? " " Will it be a lot of noisy drunks ? " " Probably . " " Jack Bailey and those . " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his fascinated eyes she has the most expressive face he has ever looked at . In an instant , Helen becomes Medea . " Jack Bailey thinks he 's smart . " " Why ? What 's he done ? " " Nothing . But he sure tries . " He is bothered . The thought of Bailey after her in a car , really putting it to her , tail or walk , and meaning it , turns him cold . He can hardly bear not to know , though he dares not ask . She gives him a smoky glance out of the corners of her eyes and looks away , toward the doors , nursing some irritable recollection . He feels inept and junior . He wants to retrieve the moment and get the scowl off her face . " The hell with Jack . We do n't have to go up . I wish we could get somewhere away from the crowd , though . " " Ah , so do I ! " Her vehemence gladdens him . The small white scar like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empha/size her perfection . Her thrond shoulders rise from the straplessgreen taffeta like a lily from its sheath . His legs are weak with how beautiful she is . Very lightly , tentatively , questioning her with his eyes , he raises his hand and with the tips of his fingers touches her bare shoulder . Whatever prince woke SleepingBeauty touched her that way , reverently , holding his breath . Her eyes fly to his , and hold . Abashed , they stand smiling at one another . Her dark unpluckedbrows lift in a question . He feels that his face has gone lopsided , like that of a wax doll left too near the fire . " We could go outside and walk around , " he says . " We could go sit in the car . " All right " " Which ? " " I do n't care . " The light in her dark eyes is not reflected , but comes from within . Not breaking his deep look into them , he sees with the lower edge of his vision the golden throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtakes and overpowersit : his mother 's face so close that the freckles blur across her nose , and the nightgown falling open to show the flatness , the scar with its angry stitch marks . Apologetically and confusedly ( why ? because he has not been able to put his mother entirely out of his mind ? because he will use even her illness to involve this girl in him ? ) he says , " I should n't go home with a breath , anyway . My mother 's sick , and if I come home smelling like a still she 'll lie awake all night convincedI 'm ruined . " Nola says with a smile , " I did n't know you were such a mama 's boy . Does she always wait up for you ? " For a moment he is angry . She is making unjust assumptions . She does n't know what she is talking about . " She 's got cancer , " he says . " She had one breast removed a couple of weeks ago . " He hears how bluntly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly a sound they have in this place , and he adds , " Not a very pleasant subject . " " Ugh , that 's terrible , " she says . " I 'm sorry . I ca n't imagine anything like that . Has she got somebody with her ? " " No , the old man had to go to L.A. I 'm her nurse . When I 'm home . "  |p135Now  he is getting even , he is covertly blaming her for leading him to neglect his duty . It is perhaps a compliment of a kind , but she hears only the rebuke , and is upset . " You should be home . You should n't have brought me to this prom . " The moment she accepts blame , he absolves her of it . " I wanted to bring you to this prom . If we were missing this prom I 'd cut my throat . " " But she should n't be left all by herself . " " She is n't that sick . She 's been getting up a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get home early . " Once more , unable to refrain , his fingers come up and touch the satiny , cool shoulder . " I do n't know , " he says , shaking his head . " I do n't know if I 'm man enough to dump you off on your front porch like some foul ball I want to get rid of . " " Bruce , why do n't we go see her ? " " Now ? " " Right now , yes . " " We 'd miss dinner . " " Who cares ? Anyway , it would n't take long , would it ? We could be back in half an hour . I hate to think of her alone and sick while we 're having fun . " " I do n't like it much myself . " " Would she mind , do you think ? " " Mind ! " He can see the two of them smiling in at her from the doorway of her bedroom , she in her emerald silk , he in his dinnerjacket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to which she has never had entry . With his arm around her , he turns her exuberantly toward the doors . " Boy , " he breathes , close to her ear . " You know something ? You 're some woman . " God help him , that is probably what he said . Mason moves himself out of the doorway to let them pass , ready to laugh at what he sees of himself in that callow youth , and bemused by how assumptions and usages change . In those days of innocence they did not call themselves men , as even boys did now . They were the boys . But girls were not girls , nor had they yet become babes or broads or birds or chicks . For a while there at the beginning of the twenties they were chickens , and briefly they were flappers because for a season or two they flopped around through snow and wet in unbuckled galoshes . Some were hotp136mamas . But generally , to the boys around 1928 , 1929 , 1930 , the females they went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than teenyboppers . I 've got a date with a woman , they said ; or , I 'm taking my woman to the picture show . They would all be told now , Mason thinks , that they needed their consciousness raised . The contemporary harpies who pass for women would probably spit on this sexism of deference , this disguised momism or whatever it was . But perhaps the boys knew something that the present has forgotten : that the only place one can first learn love is from a woman , that all tenderness , of any kind , derives from what is learned at the breast . Given a learner as insecure as young Bruce Mason , safety may well reside in some woman , mother or lover or wife or whoever . Whether women have difficulty getting credit cards or not , it is not they who racket around through empty universes hunting for a place on which to come to rest . They are themselves such a place . So it seemed to Bruce Mason then . So it seems to Mason now . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the lobby toward the revolving doors . He is voluble , deferential , proud , absurd . She moves as serenely as the moon . The elevator that he enters smells lingeringly of hair spray . He pushes the 6 button , and unreality rises under his soles . His mind is with them in the car , heading up South Temple . When he puts his key in the lock of 623 and opens the door , his mother in the light of the bed lamp lowers her magazine and looks up . Her eyes jump in alarm to the face of the Big Ben on her bed table , and then back to Bruce . " What is it ? You 're home early . Is something wrong ? " Keeping Nola out of sight , he says , " I broke my leg and they were going to shoot me , but I got away . " " You what ? " " I got away . They 're after me . " " Oh , poof ! " She is so easy to dismay ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would ever be taken entirely by surprise if something drastic happened to him , for she has imagined every possible catastrophe in the dark of sleepless nights . She has only this one basket . He is her only remaining egg.  |p137Now  he pulls Nola into the doorway . " This is Nola , Morn . We came out to see how you 're doing . " " Oh , my goodness ! " In consternation she sits up , tugs her robe tighter around her , pulls her braid across her breast , tries to smooth the mussed bed clothes , and within a second is back against her pillows , at bay . Everything she is feeling , Bruce is feeling , too . She is embarrassed to be caught unprepared and disheveled , and he shares her shame . He should have picked up the room before he went out . She does n't want to look old , sick , faded , or mutilated to the girl who smiles at her from the circle of Bruce 's arm , and he agrees : she deserves protection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in her confusion she is taking Nola 's measure and making note of the familiarity with which her shoulders wear Bruce 's arm ; and while that detail brings the ears of her apprehensionpricking up , she is going pink with pleasure at having been remembered . More than that . The eyes that take Nola in are dazzled , too . He can see admiration growing in them , and right on the heels of the admiration a caution : This is serious , he 's gone on her ; and in another split second , Oh , I do n't blame him , she 's lovely ! His mother has never met one of his girls , and would be flusteredeven if she were not caught unprepared in an untidy room . They bring the fresh air in on their clothes ; Nola 's coloring is too rich and alive beside his mother 's pallor . The contrast stares like blood on a sheet . And is there , in those first seconds , some contestgoing on ? Is it Nola 's natural warmth and sympathy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immortal that makes her so gentle with a woman sick and perhaps doomed ? It is no contest , really . They flip a coin for him , but the coin has two heads . While it is still in the air , his mother concedes , gives her blessing . She can not help loving what he loves . " Are n't you both nice ! " she cries as Nola stands over her holding her hand . " But you should n't have left your dance . " " It 's intermission , " Bruce tells her . " We 're not missing a thing except a five-course dinner , delightful company , solid-gold favors , champagne , and a few little things like that . " " Champagne ? Do they really serve champagne ? How can they ... ? "  | " You ca n't trust a word this one says , " says Nola . " Ah , " his mother says . " You 've found that out already . But he 's sort of nice , too , do n't you think ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the little compact , Bruce showed me . Do n't they put those at the girls ' places at the tables ? " " She 'll get one , " Bruce says . " Maybe three . Why else am I on the committee ? " They beam at one another , thinking of things to say . " Are n't you hungry ? " his mother says . " Dancing is hard work . " " Especially with Nola , " Bruce says . " It 's like rocking a car stuck on dead center . Only one thing to do  --  put her in high and push her backwards . " " You ought to be ashamed to say a thing like that . I 'll bet she 's a beautiful dancer . " Nola 's smile is slow and untroubled . " If I do n't just plant my feet he walks all over them . " It is an extraordinarily happy moment . Their cheerfulness lights up the room . Again his mother says , " Are n't you hungry ? You ought to have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an ulcer diet ? He probably would n't . Let me just . " Bruce pushes her emerging feet back under the covers . " You want milk or ginger ale ? " he asks Nola . " There are some compulsorycookies . I made them myself . " " Did he really ? " " Yes , he did . He can do all sorts of things . " " You 'll make some woman a good wife . " She comes close to expressing a thought that is in all their minds . From the kitchen , while he pours three glasses of milk and fills a plate with the oatmeal cookies he made the evening before to tempt his mother 's finicky appetite , he can hear the gettingacquaintedtalk going on in the bedroom , one voice clear , one husky , one asking questions , one making answers . The ranch , the brother and sister , the horse Bally , school . He hears Nola say she does n't suppose she 'll ever get to go back and live on the ranch , she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . No music down there , either , except playing for dances with the Robbers ' Roosters , and she had enough of that in high school . But she loves it down there . Maybe she can get down in June , her sister is get/ting married again , her first husband was killed in an accident in a coal mine in Helper . But that will be only a visit , a day or two . She 'll have to get a job this summer . She has another year before she gets her teaching certificate . He hears it with his mother 's ears , noting what she will have noted . One more year in school . Probably safe until she 's finished college . By then he 'll be twenty-one , at least , and will have saved more . With both of them through college and working , it might be all right . That is something he knows she wants to believe . She does not like her own caution , learned from failures of too many kinds . She ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He puts the glasses and the plate on a tray and hoists the tray on his palm and goes on in with it balanced above his shoulder . Satisfying screams tell him to be careful . Expertly he rotates it down and sets it on the bed table , shoving aside the clock and medicine bottles that he should have cleared away in advance . His mother grabs and rescues a bottle about to topple onto the floor . Then , as he straightens up , light cuts under the drawn shades and moves across the wall . Bruce and his mother look at one another . A car is idling right below the windows . While they listen , its door shuts solidly . In a moment the garage doors creak open . " Why , that 's your dad ! " she says . " He must have driven straight through . " The pleasure goes out of the room . Quietly she says to him , " Maybe you 'd better go let him in , he may not have his key . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce should warn him there is someone here , so that he wo n't come in carrying something or saying something that should n't be seen or heard outside the family . He goes back to the kitchen , angry that his father has interruptedtheir happy little party . They should have checked on his mother and gone away again while the going was good . He switches on the stair lights and opens the door , and his father is already there with his key in his hand , in shirt sleeves , his eyes bloodshot , a two-day grizzle of beard on his jaws , his hands and arms greasy from working on the car . He stares at Bruce in his monkey suit.  | " What 's this ? " Bruce raises his finger halfway to his lips . " Somebody 's here . " His father steps inside . " This time of night ? Who ? " " My date . We came back from the prom to see how Mom was doing . " The bloodshot eyes are on him hard . " Why , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " Grunting , his father reaches a glass from the cupboard and draws himself a glass of water . He watches Bruce as he drinks , and when he has gulped the glass empty he wipes the back of his dirty hand across his lips . " What were you doing at a prom , anyway ? You should have been home here looking after her . " The retort jumps to Bruce 's tongue : Why were n't you here looking after her ? But he keeps it in ; he falls back on the watchful , obscurely sullen silence that has been his response for years . He thinks his father hears it , unsaid as it is . His father 's eyes travel down Bruce 's black-and-white length . He is the kind of person for whom a tuxedo is automatically sissy or comic . Outlaw or not , within the limits of his experience and comprehension he is incredibly conservative . He accepts only what he knows . When he sees Bruce duded up in riding breeches and English boots he ca n't keep from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Giddap , " laughing and looking for corroboration at whoever else is there . Now he just looks . " Your girl 's in there , you say ? " " Yes . " " He works his cheeks as if they were cold . Briefly he leans tobare his teeth at himself in the mirror beside the kitchen door . He examines his greasy hands , and for a moment Bruce hopes he is going to go and wash , so that he and Nola can get away before he comes out of the bathroom . Instead , his father shrugs and pushes out into the dining room . Bruce comes along behind , apprehensiveand ready to be ashamed . His father 's entrance is disconcertingly like Bruce 's own of a few minutes before . He stands hidden outside the door , and intones , sepulchral and singsong , Then I sees within the doorway of a shy , retirin ' dugout Six Boches , all a-grinnin ' , and their Cap'n stuck ' is mug out.  |p141On  the last words , wearing a rubber-lipped grin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet made any sign that he knows Nola is there . Bruce watches him go in and bend over and kiss the woman in the bed  --  and that is surely showing off , that most certainly reflects his awareness of an audience . Except when he is showing off or clowning , he makes no such standard gestures of affection . Bruce 's mother 's voice , fluty and high , is as false as his kiss . " I did n't expect you so soon . How was the trip ? " Then , before he can answer , " This is Nola Gordon , Bo . These nice children left their dance to come out and see me . " Now finally he turns toward Nola . Bruce ca n't see her , but he can see the jolt she gives him . He has probably visualized Bruce 's date as some flat-chested flapper with her hemline above her knees and her waistline around her hip bones , her hair cut like a boy 's , her jaws going on a wad of gum  --  the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . At once something humorous and alert comes into his dark face , his lips remain quirked into a half smile after he has said hello . Nola 's low voice murmurs something . Bruce knows exactly how she is looking at his father , her eyes curious and interested , seeming to waver but actually steady , only the light in them changing . He ca n't stay out of it . He pushes in , crowding the littleroom with one person too many . At once he feels compared and judged . Beside his father 's size and weight and shirt-sleeve dishevelment he feels like the overdressed figure on a wedding cake . Though he is as tall as his father , he weighs fifty pounds less . He is not bearded , dirty , heavy-shouldered , smelling of physical exertion . The old helpless feeling of inferiority oppresses him . He is angry that he has brought Nola here and tried to mix the unmixable oil and water of his life . In his mother 's watching eyes there is an expression he can not read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too casual voice she says , " You 're all greasy . Did you have a flat tire or something ? " It is a cue his father has been waiting for . A short laugh erupts from his throat , he spreads his hands and looks at them , he regards Nola with an indescribable waiting slyness in his face.  |p142Bruce  reads him  --  oh , he reads him ! He has a tale to unfold . He is going to shine . " Nothing so serious as a flat tire , " he says . " I tipped over . " Bruce 's mother sits straight up . " Tipped over ! " " Ass over teacup , " he says cheerfully  --  and is there a deliberatenessin the profanity , a calculated nudge ? Bruce wishes Nola had kept her coolie coat on . Her shoulders are too naked for this room and this company . His father rolls his hands as if winding yarn . " Down the bank , clear over , and up on her wheels in the ditch . " " You could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you all right ? You did n't get hurt at all ? " " Nary a scratch . " " The car ? " " Few dints and scratches . Never broke a thing . " She knows and Bruce knows what he means . A broken bottle in a carload of liquor can be disastrous  --  you dare n't even stop for gas , for fear someone will smell you . " How ? " Bruce 's mother says . " Where ? " He is still speaking to Nola , not to her . " Down by Santaquin . Thunder shower wet the road where they 'd been grading , left it slick as soap . I came to this curve in the dark and started to skid and straightened her right out . " His muscled , oily arm shoots out , his hand makes the rolling motion . " She hit something solid and went over . Touched on her side and then on top and then came clean on over . Never even killed the engine . Bumped my head on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before I know where I am , there I 'm sitting in the ditch with the old car going chug-a-chug-a-chug under me . I could n't believe there was n't anything wrong  --  that 's where I got all dirty , checking it out . Finally I just drove down the ditch till I found a place where I could get back on the road , and came on in . " " Oh , you 're lucky ! " " Skillful , " he says , and winks at Nola , who is watching him with her expectant dark eyes and her slow smile . He sees the plate of cookies and the glasses of milk on the bed table and helps himself . " These for me ? Thankee , I think I will . " " You must be starved , " Bruce 's mother says . " Let me get you something solider than ... "  | " Stay in bed ! " Bruce says harshly . " I 'll get him something , if he wants something . " Chewing a cookie , his lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . Marksman 's eyes , he has , red-streaked and steady . It is as if he were looking down a rifle barrel . A grunt comes out of him . " I can get myself something . " " We should be getting back , anyway , " Bruce says to Nola . Obediently she picks up her coolie coat from the bed . His father looks at the Big Ben , which says ten minutes to twelve . " You starting out on your party now ? " " We 've been at the party . We just came up to see Mom . The party lasts till one . I have to be there to help close it up . I 'm on the committee . " " Well , " says his father with an incredulous laugh . " If you 're on the committee . " To Nola , in that jocular , nudging tone  --  he reminds Bruce of Jack Bailey  --  he says , " Are you on the committee , too ? " " Nope . I 'm just the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviouslyshe does not feel the bullying pressure that Bruce feels . She is pert , she looks on this as kidding . Bruce holds the coolie coat for her to slip into it , and as she half turns and raises her arms , he sees his father 's eyes on her smooth shoulders , her shaven armpits . Comprehending and feelingeverything , a reservoir of understanding and concern , his mother says from the bed , " Do n't stay out too late , now . I 'm sure Nola needs her sleep as much as you do . " " Sleeping is what I do all day Sunday , " Nola says with a smile . " Well , it 's not what your committee does , " Bruce 's father says . His eyes meet his son 's , almost as if good-natured . " I 've got work for you tomorrow , Mr. Chairman , and I do n't want to have to get you up with a stump puller . " " Do n't worry , " Bruce says , like a sullen , dominated fifteenyear-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has diminished him . His mother says , " You need some sleep yourself , Papa . You 've just driven a thousand miles nonstop , and rolled over in a ditch . " " I 'm setting the alarm for seven . " A brag , Bruce perceives . I , the untiring , the indefatigable . I plow deep while sluggards sleep . He drags Nola from her goodbyes , they get away . " Your mother 's a darling , " she says as they settle into the Ford.  | " Yes . " " She thinks you 're the cat 's pajamas . " " Yes , poor deluded thing . " He is still smarting from his father 's infallible gift for making him look small . " At least she 's right about one thing . She thinks you 're gorgeous . " " Ha ! " she says , neither affirming nor denying . After a second , when they have started up the street , she says , " You and your fatherdo n't get along . " " Was it that obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " His jokes are n't jokes . " " I thought he was cute , " she says  --  to provoke him ? " So big and sort of tough . I like tough people . " " Well , " he says , furious , " there 's always somebody willing to kiss the cow . " " Oh come on ! You 're tough yourself . Feel how hard your arm is . " She snuggles against him , holding his skinny wing . Thank God it is hard , so hard you can barely tell the muscles from the bones they are strung on . " Every time I spit I split a plank , " he says . " Them I do n't kill I cripple . " " No , I mean it . You do n't quit . I 'd hate to be on the other side from you if you really wanted something . " Mollified , he lets his feathers be smoothed . " Good . Because you know what I want ? " " Let me guess . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the prom ? " " Do you ? " " No . The other guys can close it up . I want to go up on Wasatch Boulevard and look at the lights and tasteyour raspberrylipstick . " " Oh , you do . " But she does not object . He swings up through Federal Heights toward Fort Douglas . As if she understands the sulky thoughts he still has not chased from his bead , she leans against him and begins to sing in her husky contralto . In a moment he joins her . The city falls away behind as they climb toward the foot of the mountains . He opens the car window to let the night in.  |p147Brushing  his teeth , he remembered that he had done nothing about flowers for his aunt 's funeral . As was his disciplined habit , he got his notebook out of his jacket pocket and wrote himself a reminder for the morning . Then he started to get into bed and found in the middle of it the box that he had carried from the funeralparlor that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he took the box by its cord and started to set it on the floor , he hesitated , hefting it . What would the poor old thing have put away for him ? An afghan , to keep his knees warm ? Some crocheted antimacassars ? A quilt ? It felt a little heavier than any of those things that she would probably have called " keepsakes . " And it touched him , now that he gave his attention to the box , that she would have put away anything at all . Gratitude he had not expected , never having given any affection . Perhaps she had felt it necessary to pass something on , for they were the last two survivors of a tribe , the last orphaned speakers of their family tongue . He had felt that bond himself , even while resenting her as a burden . Better that meager relationship than no relationships at all . A label had been stuck to the outside of the cardboard . It curled and came off when he touched it . The ink of the writingp148on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So this was no late senile whim . She must have boxed it up , whatever it was , years ago . " Property of Mr. Bruce Mason , " she had written on the label . Sighing , he crawled into bed , hoisted the box onto his stomach , and untied the cord . Something soft and bulky , wrapped in brown paper , filled most of the box . On top of it , sunk into depressions that had been shaping for many years , were three books , **26;6401;TOOLONG Library , ninety-five cents each , the backbone of any undergraduate library in the twenties . He stared at them , still uncomprehending . He opened one of the books and saw his own name scrawled slanting up the inside cover . Impatiently he yanked the brown parcel from the box and uncovered a white sweater with four red stripes around one sleeve . He made an astonished sound like laughter , and tipped the box . Out tumbled two bundles of letters and a manila envelope . He leaned back against the headboard so abruptly that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll be damned ! " Nola had brought that box to Joe 's house , where Bruce was staying , on the morning of his father 's funeral . This was a year after they had broken up  --  not the June of their abrupt parting but the next one , the very day when he should have been graduatingfrom law school in Minneapolis . She chose to bring back this symbolic package of repudiation not when his hurt and anger were hot , not when his mind was on her , but when he had got over her , after a fashion , and when he was gritting through the aftermath of his father 's last violence . He was anguished to be done with it all , and gone . He never spoke to her : he saw her coming up the steps and would not go to the door , but let Joe talk to her . And he never looked in the box that Joe brought inside . He scorned to take back anything he had once given her , he wanted to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after taking him from the funeral hill to the Union Pacific station , must have dropped the box with Aunt Margaret when he delivered her to the Home .

What , of the things he had given her during the time when she was an altarp149he laid offerings on , would she have felt she should return to him ? It was bizarre that she should have been the one to preserve the only relics of that time of his life . Everything else was gone . If he was a thing that lasted , the only documentation was what his estranged girl packed up to throw back at him . This was the total album and attic where that part of him could be found . He picked up the little books again . He supposed that he had loaned them to Nola and urged her to read them .

Salome , by Oscar Wilde ; Irish Fairy and Folk Tales , edited by William Butler Yeats ; Studies in Pessimism , by Arthur Schopenhauer . He opened the Yeats . The Irish word for fairy is sheehogue/sidheog , a diminutive of " shee " in banshee . Fairies are denee shee/ daoine sidhe ( fairy people ) . Who are they ? " Fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved , nor bad enough to be lost , " say the peasantry . Nothing there for a Jack Mormon girl from Emery County . What could he have been thinking of ? He laid Yeats down and picked up Schopenhauer . Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life , our existence must entirely fail of its aim . It is absurdto look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world , and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself , as serving no purpose at all and the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity than that propoundedby most systems of philosophy in declaring evil to be negative in its character .

If the reader wishes to see shortly whether this statement is true , let him compare the respective feelings of two animals , one of which is engaged in eating the other . Nothing there , either . What could she have felt when , out of his arrogant inexperience , out of his sheer undergraduate enthusiasm for hard doctrine , or the self-pity that had made him believehe was suffering 's biographer , he plucked things like this from the great grab bag of Western culture and demanded that she read and ponder them ?

" Their limited and provincial city had never given them the opportunity to hear Strauss 's opera , but even if it had , they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have delighted them , probably , to see a raging soprano stagger and crawl around the stage , smeared with blood , clutching the bloody head of her obsession by its bloody hair , she would have delighted them primarily because she was a vessel of jeweled language . In their literary way , they responded to words as incantation.  |p151Ah  , thou wouldst not suffer me to kiss thy mouth , Iokanaan . Well , I will kiss it now . I will bite it with my teeth as one bites a ripe fruit . Yes , I will kiss thy mouth , Iokanaan . I said it : did I not say it ? I said it . Ahl I will kiss it now . They would have been charmed , titillated by the sound . But Nola , though she could n't read , could have played it . Across Mason 's mind , floating in the empty room like the moon rising from a tomb , appeared the body of the dead woman he had seen that afternoon , and he felt like a ghoul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly fifty years agone . He dropped the three books over the edge of the bed and picked up the sweater , a white cardigan with a red U above the pocket and four red stripes around the upper left sleeve . The last letter he earned , part of the paraphernalia of innocent self-advertisementthen universal among athletes on a campus . Mason had the impression that the letter-sweater thing was no longer fashionable , and would embarrass a contemporary jock . Then , it had been as natural as wearing shoes . The sweater was a sort of escutcheon . You could tell by the kind  --  cardigan , pullover  --  what sport was involved . Seniors , he remembered , had had a choice between the usual red with white letter and stripes , and the dressier white with red . He had chosen white for that last one because Nola did not wear red , and this one was for her . He did n't suppose he had even tried it on . Forty-five years ago just about now , only a few weeks after the prom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the coach 's office and carried it straight to her  --  his signature , label , mark of ownership ; his substitute for a West Point class ring , juvenile forerunner of presidential citations and ribbonsof the Ugion d'honneur : decorations will be worn . Would you like to wear my sharpshooter 's medals ? Here , let me offer you my Purple Heart . We 're like sun myths , he said to the listening presence of Joe Mulder , who had come quietly into his head and stood there attendinglike someone watching the evening 's television news . We 're like sun myths in the late afternoon of a cloudy day , look/ing back at the morning , when we were ascendant , when ow strength waxed instead of waning . Being in love with that girl was only part of it , for me . Just picking up this sweater puts me back to that time when everything was cresting . It was n't a time of choices , though it might seem so . The sun leaned on us , and warmed us on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if we leaned too far , we toppled , and toppling , toppled others . Call it the domino theory.  |p153He  is walking along Thirteenth East Street on an absolutely perfectmorning , a creation morning . Perhaps there was a shower during the night , but it feels as if prehistoric Lake Bonneville has risen silently in the dark , overflowing its old beach terraces one by one , flooding the Stansbury , then the Provo , on which this street is laid , then finally the Bonneville ; filling the valley to overflowing , stretching a hundred miles westward into the desert , lapping against the Wasatch , pushing long fjords into the canyons , washing away all the winter smoke , softening thealluvial gravels , rinsing and freshening every leaf of every shrub and tree , greening every blade of grass ; and then before daylighthas withdrawn again into its salty remnant , leaving behind this universal sparkle and brightness . It is such a morning as all the old remember and only the young belong in . School is over , college is done with , summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dewy coolness to the bottom of his lungs . His feet are light on the sidewalk , lighter yet on the parking-strip grass where he prefers to walk . In his left hand is an old canvas equipment bag , in his right a tennis racket , imperceptibly cracked in the throat from his bad habit of hitting his overhead with a lot of spin , like a second service . With thisp154cracked but otherwise very satisfactory racket , which he hopes to sell that morning to Maw Eldridge , who is just taking up tennis and is not discerning , he takes the heads off dandelions , forehand and backhand . His footwork is nimble , his backswing fluent , his eye is on the ball , he follows through with a snap . He wears clean white cords , white buck shoes , and his letter sweater with three stripes , and every detail of himself gratifies him . He admiresthe springy condition of his legs and the strength of his right forearm , considerably bigger than the left . The characteristictennis player 's callus on the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side where he walks is shaded by tall houses , but between them and at intersections the sun slants through and stretches across the street to lean on eastward-facing porches where bottles of milk and rolled Tribunes wait to be retrieved . The cones of pink blossom on the horse chestnut trees light up like candles when the sun strikes them . The leaves around them are heavy and rich and dark . At the drugstore on the Second South corner he turns right , up the slope toward where the Park Building 's white marble front overlooks the Circle and the tree-dotted lawn . This is a different sort of morning from the hundreds when he has walked up this gentle hill toward an early class . Everything is over except Commencement , which , scornful of ceremonies , he will evade . Nothingremains but last errands . He sees only a few straggling students . The scene has been clarified and hardened into finality like a negative in the fixing bath , yet it is morning , with morning'sexcitement in it , and he walks toward unlimited possibility . Ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building and overexposes his sight . The mountains beyond are backlighted and featureless . Now at the edge of the Circle , Maurice comes wobbling and scurrying across the grass , waving his arms , uncoordinated and ablaze with greeting . His hair is wild , the words he speaks are chewed and unintelligible . He wears his brown leather jacket and basketball shoes , and he obviously wants something . It takes Bruce half a minute to comprehend : Maurice wants to carry his racket . Given it , he is transformed . He handles it with both hands like a battle-ax , making fierce faces and sweeping the air.  |p155Old  Maurice , the campus moron , enthusiastic leader of cheers at football games , self-appointed master of ceremonies at pep rallies , front prancer in snake dances after high school basketballI at games , adorer of all athletes . Everybody knows Maurice , everybodylaughs and groans when he goes scrambling and falling in a frenzy of school spirit out of the stands and onto the cinder track . Some people , especially girls of the snottier kind , find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that would be the worst sort of unkindness . Distorted image of Bruce 's own innocence , Maurice touches and amuses him . He feels protective , and kids him along . Who could resist his adoration ? He reveres this hero in his letter sweater with three stripes , he is ennobled to be seen with him . Out of the corners of his odd little mismatchedeyes he invites the attention of a couple of gardeners returfing a worn patch of lawn , and when they look up grinning he decapitates them with two swings in the air . At the steps of the L Building , Bruce offers to take the racket back , but Maurice does n't want to give it up . He will look after it . He understands its preciousness , he will take the greatest care of it . So Bruce leaves him sitting on the sandstone steps , cradling the racket in his lap and shielding it from a student who passes too close . Bill Bennion 's office , always a mess , is on this morning a total mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs are piled with books recently returned by undergraduate borrowersand not yet restored to the shelves , which anyway are too jammed with other books , cardboard boxes of notes , stacked mgazines , and wadded lunch bags smelling of banana skins to hold them . The wastebasket has overflowed onto the floor . On the window ledges and on the tops of the radiators the dust is thick over piles of mimeographed sheets that have been there in that condition ever since Bruce first came into this office as a sophomore . He has been in it many times since that first one . A lot of literarybull sessions have gone on here . He has been introduced to a lot of books here , and has carried them out and brought them back and been profanely quizzed about them . Across these piles of themes and across the littered desk he has broadcast his share of barbaric yawp , and been set straight without impatience byp156the smiling man who sits across there with the morning sun pouring in on him from behind , turning his bald skull into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke of his pipe . From the equipment bag he takes Carl Van Vechten 's The Tattooed Countess and Eliot 's For Lancelot Andrews , and pushes clear a corner of the desk and lays them on it . " Well , " says his professor and friend Bill Bennion , watching him benignantly through his smoke . " The end of something . " " The very end . " " Now what ? " " Now what ? " " What are you going to do with yourself ? " " Oh , what a dusty answer gets the soul , " Bruce says , " when hot for certainties in this our life ! " " You horse 's ass , " Bennion says , and takes his pipe out of his mouth to laugh . When he laughs , the slight cast in one eye is accentuatedand his benignant expression is touched with completelyfriendly scorn . In the equipment bag Bruce finds some pages of an old theme , crumples them into a ball , looks for a place to put them , feints left , feints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight corner of the wastebasket . " Hey , look . " He blows his whistle and holds up two fingers . " Do n't evade the issue , you cretin , " Bennion says . " What are you doing to do ? " " What is there to do ? Birth , copulation , death . Choice is an il-lusion . " " The hell it is . If you turn out to be a gardener , after all the effort I 've put in on you , I 'll staple you to a stump by the balls . Have you decided ? Or have n't you put your so-called mind to it at all ? " With his hands behind his head , his arms fuzzy with pale hair all the way around , even on the inside , even on the biceps , he scowls through the smile that never leaves his face  --  ca n't leave his face , that 's the way his face is . He has no other expression except that benevolent , interested , slightly strabismic , pleasantly scornful smile . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose maybe I ought to take the fellowship and get an M.A. "  | " In English ? " " Is n't that what you offered me one in ? You did n't think I should take the one Parker offered me in philosophy . " " That 's right , you should n't . You 've got better things to do with your life than losing yourself in a subject nobody believes exists . What 'll you do with an M.A. if you get it ? " Bruce shrugs , without an idea , and if the truth were told , untroubled . " Teach ? " " I do n't know . Maybe . " " Are you prepared to go on for a Ph.D. ? If you 're going to teach in any place worth teaching in , you 'll have to have it . " " Utah does n't give Ph.D.s . " " I know that , for God 's sake . You 'd have to go away some-where . " " I have n't thought much about it . " Bennion looks upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , " he says . " You know , you 're the damnedest , most unmotivated , drifting son of a . . . Have you talked to Notestein ? " " No . " " Well , I have . I 've been talking to him for three weeks , and he 's been talking to everybody he knows . He 's got you a fellowshipat the University of Minnesota Law School if you want it . " There , just there , begins the redirection of Bruce Mason 's life , but he does not realize it . He is simply astonished . " He what ? " " You heard me . He thought he could , and it turns out he can . He must have lied like a thief about your miserable little capacities , to get you in this late . So what are you going to do , tell him no thanks ? " " Well , but Jeez , that complicates ... " " You bet it complicates . It complicates you right into where you have to make up your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never had any ambition to be a lawyer . Whylaw ? " Because that 's what 's available . Because Notestein 's a lawyer and that 's where his connections are . Because he has this halfbakedconfidence that you might make a lawyer . That 's the trouble with all of us . We think you 're fit for something or other , and break our asses trying to set something up for you , and you don'tp158know , you ca n't make up your mind , you have n't thought about it . Well , think about it i " " Yes , sir . " " Look , you moron , " Bennion says . " I know I offered you a fellowship , but that was just to keep you from wasting your time in philosophy . I never did think taking an M.A. in English , here , would do you any good . You 've taken all our courses , you 've learned anything we can teach you . You need to get out and knock your head against bigger people and bigger ideas . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had , we 'd both have thought of this a lot sooner , and we might have got you somethingat Berkeley , or even Harvard or Yale or some place East that would really jar you loose . But you did n't , and I did n't , so Minnesota is the only decent shot you 've got . " " Yeah , but law . " " Law 's one kind of education , maybe a damn good kind . You do n't have to practice it , or even teach it . Just let it educate you  --  and do n't think you 're past being educated . My point is , if you do n't make your break now , at the natural time to make it , you never will . You 'll sit out in that nursery growing roots in your behind , and marry one of those half-mast-eyed girls you squire around , and wind up with six kids in primary school , twins in the baby buggy , triplets in the oven , your ass in a sling , and your double hernia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh . " Minnesota , " Bruce says , trying out the idea . " My mother came from Minnesota . I just missed being born there , right out there in the cornfield . I have n't been that far east since I was four . " " What I 'm telling you . Time you went . Somewhere , to study something . " " Subpoena duces tecum , " Bruce says , by Joe Mulder out of his lawyer brother . " With or without the ad testificandum clause . How long is law school ? " " Two years ? " Bennion says . " Three ? I 'm not sure . " " Good God , what would I tell my goil ? " " That 's just what I thought was on your mind , " Bill says , as grimly as his overweening benevolence will permit . The cast in his eye gives him a mad , squinting , leprechaunish look . " I expectp159you could tell her a lot of things she 'd rather hear , but I know what I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'd tell her to wait . " Out on the steps old Maurice , Fidus Achates , is still guarding Bruce 's racket . Bruce thanks him profusely and shakes his hand . Maurice loves to shake hands , standing to it with his chest out and his eyes front like somebody having the Congressional Medal of Honor pinned on him . Then Bruce gives him a nickel for a root beer and turns him around and starts him down the hill with a pat on the back . All the way across the Circle he keeps turning around to wave . Leon Notestein , the president 's assistant , is not in his office , but he has left an envelope for Bruce . It contains a letter from the dean of the Minnesota Law School , saying that Leon knows perfectly well it is too late to admit anyone , and much too late for fellowships , but on the strength of Leon 's uncritical admiration for this boy , he is holding a tuition scholarship and will hold it for two weeks at the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you want this , get the application in , with all papers and fee , right now . Call me Tues . A.M. if questions . " Questions Bruce has plenty of . Doubts  --  and this strikes him as curious  --  he has none . Only a sort of wonder : this is the way things will happen . From the time he left Bennion 's office he has been as little complicated by indecision as Maurice on his way to the soda fountain . They put this nickel in his hand and turn him around and pat him on the back and start him on the way he is supposed to go , and off he goes , waving back bravely . Regardless of his worth or his wishes , his destiny is directed by fairy godmothers . If glass slippers are in the script , they will be his size . If pumpkin coaches roll up , he will be the one for whom their doors open . God 's fool , he floats through the errands he came to do . Mary Eldridge is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after waiting ten minutes Bruce gives him up and goes to clean out his locker in the Park Building basement . Then back to the bookstore to turn in his key and get his refund . Still no Eldridge.  |p160He  goes on up to Ham Barrentine 's office and picks up his last sweater . Ham gets a little sentimental over the last four years , and shakes his hand and grips his shoulder . He asks what Bruce is going to do now that he has graduated , and Bruce tells him that he is probably going to law school in Minneapolis . Emerging from the Park Building on his way to the gym to clean out his locker there , he finds Joe Mulder sitting under a tree with his sweater box beside him , intently watching dozens of little red-and-black box-elder bugs crawl among the hairs on his arms . He offers an arm to Bruce . " Have some ? " " I would n't want to deprive you . " " Nice bugs . No bitee . Just friendly and gregarious . I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Giving it to Nola ? " " I guess . " " Make that girl a four-letter word , " Joe says . " How about a couple of sets to wrap up the season ? " " I ought to be out to work by eleven . There 's about twenty tons of bullshit to bag . " " Let Welby bag it . Break him in right . We can play a couple of sets and still get there before noon . " " O.K. , but I have to allow time to get there on the streetcar . My car 's in the shop . " " I 've got mine . Come on , I smell the blood of an English major . " " I 'll beat your brains out , " Bruce promises him . " On the last day of the season Mulder learns how it feels to be number two . " It really is a solar myth morning . For five years , ever since that day at the tennis club when he was fifteen , Bruce has been givinghis body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the commercial league , seizing every spare hour at school to work out on the weights and run laps , hitting tennis balls against the bangboard , playing anybody handy , running practice sessions a set or two sets long . There is a lot of physical work at the nursery , too , and he likes it . Nobody is going to admire him for his physique , but he has labored to make them admire his old college try , and in spite of his ulcer he is in the shape of his life . That morning , a Sir Gareth out of thep161kitchens , he takes on Lancelot , who taught him everything he knows , and he unhorses him . The varsity courts are cement , and very fast , made for big servers . Joe 's service is not only big , it is heavy  --  it can twist your racket out of your hand . Overhead he is brutal . If you feed him a lob anywhere short of the base line you might just as well turn your back and hope he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too long-armed to pass , too severe to be outsteadied . The only way to play him , at least on these courts , is power against power , and that is the day Bruce can do it . He has modeled his game on Joe 's , after all . They are taking the net at every chance . Nobody loses any points  --  the other wins them . They ace each other many times , they are both bouncing smashes over the fence and punching volleys off at sharp angles . Or else getting cleanly passed . It must be spectacular , the way they are hitting them , for by the middle of the first set they have begun to draw a crowd . By the end of it the crowd is cheering every point . When they change courts after Bruce has won the first set , Joe works his pink eyebrows at him ferociously : from here on , he will get his . Bruce shrinks his shoulders together and cringes . " Now the roof falls in , " he says . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe goes on playing his best , which is good enough to beat nearly anybody in the state , and still Bruce beats him . Just to make it convincing , he aces him on match point . Red , grinning , and amazed , as wet as if he has stood under a sprinkler , and with his hair dark red and kinky with sweat , Joe comes up to the net pretending he is going to throw his racket at Bruce 's head . " God damn , Joe , " Bruce says , as happy as he has ever been in his life . " Why ca n't I play like that every time out ? " " Because you ca n't be unconscious all the time , " Joe says . " You silly son of a bitch , Mason , if you played that way every time out you 'd be beating Doeg and Vines . " The crowd is dispersing . The sky has developed very white puffballs of cloud down over the Oquirrhs . The sun pours down , still well short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his hands , and kisses the cement of the court . The locker and shower rooms are entirely empty , hollow andp162reverberant and thick with the smells of old fellowship  --  Ivory soap , steam , Lysol , fresh sweat and stale sweat , the rubbery fragranceof tennis balls kept in a locker , even the lingering smell of the shellac with which they doctor frayed strings to make them last . They take a long , ceremonial shower , perhaps their last in that place , and sit on the worn benches and dress without hurry . " You know something , Mason ? " Joe says . " This could be the summer we do it . We play the way we were both playing this morning and there 's nobody around here can take us . We could win the Adams , the State , the Intermountain , the whole shebang . " " Maybe a lot of California ringers will be coming through looking for tournament experience . " " They wo n't bother with anything but the Intermountain . They do n't like the high-altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll take the Adams and the State . What the hell , why not the Intermountain , too , ringers or not . When does it come ? " " September , I think . About the middle . " " Oh , hell , " Bruce says , shot down by a thought . " I might not be here . " " Why ? You taking a Hawaiian vacation or something ? " " I might be going to law school . " Joe stares . " Do n't shit me , Mason . " " I 'm not . Notestein and Bennion have wangled me a scholarshipat Minnesota . I guess I 'm in if I want to fill out the papers . " Joe pulls on a sock , watching Bruce as if he expects him to break out laughing . Bruce can see him begin to believe . As he pulls on the other sock he says , " Have you told my old man ? " " No . I just heard about it two hours ago . " " Because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retiring in a few years and turning the business over to you and me . " " You mean to you . " " Both of us . He 's got this plan for letting you buy in  --  you know , a little at a time , out of your wages , or maybe giving you some stock as a bonus . He thinks people work better when they own part of what they 're working at . " Bruce is troubled , for this is what in his most ambitious hour he would have dreamed of until a few hours ago . His eyes catchp163Joe 's , he reaches for his shoes . " That sounds like something you dreamed up . Keeping the old team together . " " No . He likes you . He likes the way you work . Always has . " Feeling like a heel , selfish and ungrateful , Bruce says , " Well , I have n't really made up my mind . I 've still got a day or two . " They are a little ill at ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they clear out their lockers and throw away stiff old gym socks and worn tennis balls . Bruce jams his stuff into the equipment bag , Joe rolls his into a wad , and they go down to the parking lot loaded with rackets , gear , and the big boxes containingtheir sweaters . It is getting hot . The rumble seat of Joe 's Ford is an open oven . They throw their stuff into it and climb in . " Have we got time to run down past Nola 's ? " Bruce asks . " I guess so . The Temple Square ? " " No , she 's moved out of there . That place was full of snoops . She 's got an apartment with two other girls down on Fifth East . They 're all working at Auerbach 's this summer . " " What 's the matter with you ? " Joe says . " Letting yourself get crowded out by a couple of Auerbach clerks . " " They 're protection , " Bruce says . " We do n't trust ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would n't be surprised , at that . " Neither would Bruce . Since the night when he played hideand-seekwith the elevator man , he and Nola have been headed toward something serious that neither of them speaks about and that both understand . " She know you 're going to law school ? " " How would she ? I told you , I just heard a couple hours ago . Anyway , it is n't a cinch I 'm going . " " You gon na tell her now ? " They tip down the Second South hill . Bruce punches Joe in the arm . " Listen , Giuseppe , I have n't had time to think about it . My family do n't even know . No use to bring it up till I 'm sure . So when we get down to Nola 's , how about just unostentatiously keeping your face shut ? " One cough of laughter comes out of Joe . " My face is a lot more unostentatious shut than open . Mason , you silly bastard , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce points out , and Bruce hops down and reaches the sweater box from the rumble seat . It is well baked . The high sun pours down on him . The old run-down street smells of summer . The cottonwoods are shedding fluff . " You coming in ? " Joe does n't move . " I 'll just sit out here and keep my face unostentatiouslyshut . But do n't poop around , Mason . The old man will be out there before one , and it 'd be a good idea to be busily bagging bullshit when he arrives . Or it would be , that is . . . He leans to inspect something on the left running board . " It would be if the chance to become a partner in the Mulder Nurserymeant anything to you . " He makes Bruce mad ; he seems to blame , or threaten . " Joe , you know goddamn well it means a lot . " " Fine . Glad to hear it . " " You think I do n't know how much you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe says . " Go on in and give her her sweater and kiss her tenderly a few times and get the hell back out . I 'll sit here and think up a firm name to replace Mulder and Mason , Nursery Stock Bedding Plants , and Garden Supplies . " " I 'll come back and be the company lawyer . " " What do we need of a lawyer ? " Joe says . " The job we 've got open is for an experienced bullshit bagger with a stake in the business . "  |p165From  the apartment entrance he looks back upon the hot street , the sharp shade of trees , the old Ford with Joe 's red head stickinghigh above the windshield , the bright morning climbing toward the peak of noon . And from far off , he looks upon himself standing there on the brink of something . A voice goes on in his head , patiently explaining , like the voice of someone explaining baseball to an Arab . Accident , they say , favors the prepared mind . Opportunity knocks only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe the novels we read , upward mobility is always ambitious , hungry , and aggressive , or at the very least , discontented . The George Willards are forever yearning away from the spiritual starvation of Winesburg toward some vague larger life . But that is not always the way it is . Some of us did n't know enough to be discontented and ambitious . Some of us had such limited experience and limited aspirations that only accident , or the actions of others , or perhaps some inescapable psychosocial fate , could explode us out of our ruts . In a way , I suppose I had to hitchhike out of my childhood ; but if I did , I did it without raising my thumb.  |p166The  provinces export manpower , yes , as surely as atmospheric highs blow toward atmospheric lows . But the brains that are drawn outward to the good schools , the good jobs , the opportunities , do n't necessarily initiate their move . It can be as unavoidableas being born . They feel themselves being rotated into position . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that pain , blood , glaring light , sudden cold , forceps , scissors , hands tying Boy Scout knots in their umbilicus , they could neitherprevent nor delay it . Head first , leg first , butt first , out they go . Bruce is feeling the strains of that inevitability as he walks away from Joe , whom he has just rejected , and puts his thumb on the doorbell of Nola , whom he will leave behind . No Fates have woven him into any fabric of obligation . He was not born to found Rome , he has no specific compulsion to be rich and famous , he is incapable of calculation and strategy . On the contrary , his wishes and his visible future coincide . What Joe and J. J. Mulder have planned for him will guarantee every dream he ever had , and secure him in the middle-class security he has alwayscoveted . He can make a decent home for his mother ( in these daydreams the old man is always gone  --  divorced or dead , vanished somewhere ) . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl whom he contains as a house contains a furnace . Her pilot light is never out . A slight change of temperature , a turn of the thermostat , and his heated blood clanks in his radiators . Can he give her up , or postpone her , perhaps for years ? Can he go away and leave his mother to the old man 's selfishness and dependence ? Can he cut himself away from everything familiar and secure  --  friends , job , tennis , Sundays when the whole hard week uncoils and stretches ? The answer is that he probably can , for he is tacitly planning to . But September is a long way off . Decision , though he has to sign his name to it within a few days , will not produce its consequencesfor three months . Nola is a long lime coming . He rings again , wondering if she may already have started working at her summer job . Then the knob turns , and he is looking at a young man whose face , strange to him , is clouded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected that Bruce stumbles over his tongue . Almostcontemptuously the young man opens the door , and as Bruce steps in he sees Nola standing in the living room with her fingertips on the back of an overstuffed chair . Her fingers are bent backward with the weight she is putting on them . Her face is scowling , the Indian look heavy in it . Tableau . Bruce and the young man inspect one another without making their interest too obvious , and Nola stands sullenly by the chair with the light behind her and her face in shadow . It is several hard seconds before she says , " You two do n't know each other . Eddie , this is Bruce Mason . Bruce , Eddie Forsberg from down home . He just graduated from West Point . " They shake hands . Forsberg has a polite , stiff manner , and his handshake is firm and brief . Bruce has no way of knowing what Forsberg knows about him , but he knows at least one thing about Forsberg . High school sweetheart . The air is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve of an importantmatch . " Are n't you working today ? " Nola says . " I 'm on my way . I just dropped by to . . . " He carefully does not look at Forsberg , but feels his attention . It occurs to him that he ought to save the sweater for a more private occasion . It is a dirty trick to rub the guy 's nose in the fact that someone else has intimate understandings with his former girl . But he has the box in his hands , and here is this rival waiting across the net . He serves , and he goes for an ace. " . . . give you the sweater I promised you . " She takes the box and sets it on the thick back of the chair to open it . Then Bruce becomes aware that Forsberg is looking at him with pale , furious knowledge . Pointedly he drops his eyes to Bruce 's hand , on the fourth finger of which Bruce is wearing his West Point class ring . In civilian clothes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his regimentals . For all he knows , the sweater with its four stripes certifies that Bruce is some notable athlete , able to broad-jump twenty-five feet or give Nurmi a run for it in the mile . Or perhaps he is n't thinking any such thing . Perhaps he is just sick at his stomach with the certainty that he is out and Bruce is in . He interrupts Nola 's badly acted pleasure in the sweater withp168some unconvincing acting of his own . His face has gone pinched and pale , his voice is too loud . " Well , " he says , " I see it 's time for me to take my unwanted presence out of here . " Bruce would hate to have Nola look at him the way she looks at Forsberg  --  forbidding and uncharitable . Contributory , embarrassed , and triumphant , he stands outside the closed circuit of their tension . With his sweater forgotten in her hands , Nola says , " Will I see you again ? " " What would be the point ? " A slight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Eddie . " " Are you ? " He transfers his attention to Bruce , and he is more ham actor than ever . Bruce understands that it is his real and angry feeling that makes him sound so false . " I owe you my thanks , " he says , and all but bows . " It 's been very instructive . " Bruce does not answer ; he is both appalled and ready to laugh . Anyway , what is there to say ? Forsberg has read the situationcorrectly . He takes hold of the doorknob with his left hand , and salutes derisively with his right . " There are some advantages to being in the Army , " he says . " Then you do n't have to join the Foreign Legion . " His laugh sprays around the room . " Have a very pleasant time down in Castle Valley , " he says , and is gone , slam . The moment the door closes , Nola spins around and with spread fingers lifts her hair off her head as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the scoop ? " " Oh , he makes me so mad ! I hate people who act as if they own you . " " What 's he done ? " Now her eyes lock with his , a look that is at once searching and almost furtive . " He 's been after me all morning to marry him and go off to the Philippines . " This information takes Bruce 's wind . It is far more threatening than Forsberg 's actual presence was . The thought of his intense attempt , the intimacy and seriousness of his intention , the previousunderstandings it suggests , is demoralizing . " Just out of a clear sky ? " " Oh , he 's been writing . I never gave him any encouragement . "  |p169So  they have been corresponding , and Bruce has known nothing about it . Bruce has understood that the ring , which he stole off her finger and which she never made him give back , was something from the past . Apparently he has been misinformed . While he and Nola have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other wild , working closer to what they both want and anticipate and do n't quite know how to approach , she has been writing this other fellow . She has kept him informed of her changes of address , else how did he find her ? The thought of bow much he does n't know , how much she has not told him , leaves a cold , hollow spot in his solar plexus . " You never talked about him . " " There was no reason to . I 've only seen him a few times in three or four years . " " Were you ever engaged or anything ? " " No , of course not . " " He must have thought so . Otherwise why would he think there was a chance you 'd marry him and go off to the Philip-pines ? " " I have no idea . Why would any girl go off to the Philippines with anybody ? " " Is that why you turned him down ? " " Oh , what do you think ? " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? What more do you want ? " Caution . Move softly . Lightly he says , " You ought to introduce him to Holly . She 's red hot to go to the Philippines or any place else . " There is an annoyed , fuming silence . He hears himself like some bothersome insect . " Were you ever in love with him ? " " Will you let it drop ! " " All right , all right " He folds her in his arms , but she is a stiff armful . In a moment she pulls back to look into his face . " He would n't believe me when I said it was over ! " " It ? " " Oh , whatever it was ! I used to go out with him in high school . He thought he could come back and I 'd look at him once and that would be that . " " It was seeing me wearing his ring that convinced him . " " Yes . "  | " That makes me feel sort of crummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He does n't mean anything . " If he does n't mean anything , why is she upset ? Yet she did send him away . She stonily sent him away , and Bruce is in possession . " What did he mean , have a good time down in Castle Valley ? " " I told him you were driving me down to Audrey 's wedding . It was the only thing I could think of that would put him off . " " Why would n't he just have come to the wedding himself ? " " He 's sailing from San Francisco in three days . Anyway "  --  she gives him a smoldering look , her face a foot from his , so that he sees the little check mark scar above her eye  --  " anyway , if he showed up there my father would shoot him , or my brother Buck would . " He laughs . " You 're kidding . What for ? " " Because they do n't like him . " " They must not like him an awful lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his arms and goes to the window , to stand pulling the curtain aside and lookingout . She is in such a state that he can almost see the sparks fly off her . " Would they shoot me if I appeared with you ? " Flash out of the corners of her eyes . " Why , are you scared ? " " They ca n't object so long as my intentions are honorable . " " Are they ? " He laughs . " No . " It is not the right tone to assume . She is not in a mood for joking . Some grudge rankles in her . " That 's so , is n't it ? " she says . " You 're like all the others . You 're just after what you can get . " " For God 's sake ! " Were Forsberg 's intentions not honorable , is that what she means ? Is that why her father or brother would shoot him if he showed up ? Did somebody catch them at something ? How far did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear on Forsberg 's . He glares at her in doubt and suspicion . She has tears in her eyes . She is really angry . " I should have told Eddie yes . At least he wanted to marry me , he was n't just fooling around . " " Nola , " he says , distracted , " what are you talking about ?  |p171Who  's fooling round ? What makes you think I do n't want to marry you ? " " You 've never said one word . " " That does n't mean ... " Accusingly she interrupts . " You know how it 's getting with us . I keep waiting for you to say something , but you never . . . " He has a moment of complicated clarity . He understands that without really telling him anything about her past relations with Forsberg , she is using Forsberg as a lever under him . This is not something he resents or resists it excites him . It is clear that , accusinghim of only fooling around , she would be upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to do . But there are cautions in him , just as clear . He remembers that conversation with Holly : In the good old-fashioned way ? In the good oldfashionedway . Meaning you want to marry her ? Well , sometime , sure . Not right next week . Bill Bennion , too : Six kids in primary school , twins in the baby buggy , triplets in the oven , your ass in a sling , and your double hernia in a nice supportive truss . A quicksand , Bennion would call her , a swamp to drown in . But how intolerable is the thought of not drowning ! He thinks of the folded papers in his hip pocket , and what those say about his intentions , and is shaken . He has intended to tell her . But not now , not now . He takes her in his arms and kisses her long and hard , looking all the while into her wide-open eyes . " Will you marry me ? " From the way she tries to read him , he might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed it in both hands after Forsberg left . " Yes , " she says , and puts her forehead against his chest and pounds it on him . " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry ! " " Sorry why ? Do n't you want to ? " " I made you say it . " " You never made me say anything I did n't want to say . " She rubs her nose against him . Her breath is warm through his shirt . In a little voice she says , " I just got my grades . They are n't very good . " " That 's my fault . I 've been taking up all your time . " " I took up yours , too . And you 've been working , besides . What did you get , straight A 's ? "  |p172As  a matter of fact , he did , but he lies . " Not that good . " " Whatever you got , you can do it . You 're bright , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my certificate , and luckier if I get a decentjob . I 'm twenty-two , Bruce ! I do n't want to spend my life clerking at Auerbach 's . " " Do n't worry , I 'll see you do n't have to " Now she is reading him again , braced back against his arm . " You mean you 'll take care of me ? I wonder . You 'll take advantage of me and then something will come up , some chance or other , and you 'll drop me like a hot rock . " The papers burn in his hip pocket . He does not know what he is going to do about them . But what he says is : " I told you I want to marry you . What more can I say ? As a matter of fact , Joe was just telling me his dad wants the two of us to take over the nursery . He 'd let me buy in . I 'd be a partner . " Hearing himself , he is both dismayed and thrilled  --  dismayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thrilled because , spelled out this way , job and girl and all , the second option takes his breath . " As for taking advantage of you , " he whispers into her pinesoap-scentedhair , " yes ! I ca n't wait . " Her eyes come up a moment and are hidden against his chest again . He sees the part in her hair . Even in his heated state , as with Forsberg a few minutes earlier , he notes how false real emotion can make us appear . She looks coy and false . " You , too , " he tells her . " You love me . You want to . Do n't you ? " She says into his shirt , " Would I be acting like this if I did n't ? Damn you , you . . . You know what I was thinking when I told Eddie you were driving me down home ? I was hoping you would . I kept thinking of being alone with you . I kept wanting to show you off to Buck and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after me to marry some nice boy and settle down and quit living in apartments . He thinks it 's dangerous , or immoral , or something . And I was thinking , if we did go , there might be some place . . . I know I could n't say no to you , and I did n't know how you felt about  --  marriage , and everything . If I did n't say no , and then you did n't want to marry me , where would I be ? You would n't respect me . You 'd lose interest . "  |p173What  he hears is unreal , like the murmured talk of a talking picture heard without seeing the picture . Laocoon in the toils of his serpent had no more pressure on his chest or thunder in his ears . He tips her chin up and stares into her eyes , to see if they are saying what her mouth is saying . But she will not look directly at him . He encloses her in a shivering , exultant hug . " When is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you postpone starting your job ? Say you 're not quite through school ? " " I think so . " " I 'll get tomorrow and the next day off . How far is it down there ? " " A hundred and seventy-five miles . " " My car 'll be fixed by tonight . We can leave early tomorrow and camp out somewhere and come " in just before the wedding , as if we 'd driven straight down . " She studies him with her lower lip bitten thoughtfully under her even teeth . " I . . . ca n't leave early tomorrow . " " Why not ? " Her eyes hunt in his like someone hunting for a lost earring in the grass . " I have to see somebody . " " Who ? " " Why are you so inquisitive ! The doctor , if you have to know . " " About what ? What 's wrong ? " " Never mind . " " Ca n't it wait ? " Her eyes still hunting in his , her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " Heated conjectures have started up in him . He is almost totallyignorant , and timid to boot , and afraid to think what his mind suggests to him . Yet the suggestion is unavoidable . Somethingfemale . Something in preparation for their trip ? He knows the limerick about the girl from St. Paul who went to the birthcontrolball , and about her pessaries and other accessories , but he has only a dim idea what the accessories might be , or how they work . In the world of Jack Bailey it is the gentleman who provides protection . Is she really , as coolly as this , contemplating getting herself something , knowing she intends to go all thep174way ? The thought instantly quells desire . Then he realizes that she has no such thing in mind . She could not even conceive of taking love so coolly . She is only telling him that she has something wrong , some variety of the female troubles that the Lydia Pinkham ads speak of but nice girls do not . " When do we go , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I sure as hell will . And the day after , too , so we can stop somewhere on the way back . " The further this conversation goes , the more unbelievable it is . He looks into the bottomless brown pool of her eyes , and what he sees there lifts him eight inches off the floor . " Do you know somewhere ? " " I was thinking . Have you ever been in Fruita ? " " In the Capitol Reef ? " " Yes . It 's just a pocket in the cliffs , on the Dirty Devil . An uncle of mine has a peach orchard there . We 've camped in it sometimes . There 's a grove of cottonwoods , and a ditch that comes right out of the river , and an old log house that he stores hay in . Nobody lives within two or three miles . Anyway , they 'll all be staying on at home after the wedding . " " Perfect ! " He puts his lips to the fragrant part in her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell me you will . " " You 'll think I 'm fast . " " I think you 're wonderful . Gorgeous ! Incredible ! Beyond compare ! Say you will . " " Oh , do I have to tell you ? " She lays her forehead against his chest and immediately pulls it back . " Bruce ? " " What ? " " I do n't want you to think . . . " " I do n't think anything except that you love me . " " No , there 's something . . . . Why I have to go to the doctor . I 've got . . . You know , something 's a little wrong . To fix it they might have to . . . I might not be technically a virgin . " Full of magnanimity , he forgives her . " Who cares ? " " I do n't want you to think anything . " " You 're a darling . " She takes his wandering hands and holds them . " You ! " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get mixed up with ! "  | " Are you afraid ? " Her eyes swim and change , they have suction in them , they pull him down . She is smiling . With her eyes wide open she kisses him . Eventually , somehow , he breaks away , still leaning to kiss her one more time through the door as it closes . He is shaky , his face is stiff . What he feels as he leaps down the sidewalk is not love , not desire , not anything that simple . It is nothing that needs furthergratification . It is already gratified . It is wonder . The sun is intense and dizzying , straight overhead . The shade where Joe sits seems like darkness . When he levitates into the seat , Joe rouses himself . " You already ? You have n't been gone more than two hours . If you 'd only stayed a while , Welby 'd have had it all bagged . " " Bullshit . " " Pree-cisely , " Joe says . Pulling away from the curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bruce curiously out of the corners of his eyes , but he asks no questions . As for Bruce , he seethes behind his pretense of everyday-ness . His mind is full of reruns of the scene he has just left . He is formulating the lies he will have to tell J. J. Mulder in asking for two days off . And one other thing , one unworthy thought : If a girl were getting ready to go to bed with a fellow , and was n't sure how experienced or inexperienced he was , but was afraid he might know she was not a virgin , she might , if she were schemingbut not too clever , tell such a story as Nola had just told him . An expert in untruths , he feels the unlikelihood of her being deflowered , at just this moment , by a doctor . It is too pat . It anticipatespotential questions . And there is Eddie Forsberg , high school sweetheart , who had some reason to think she might marry him and go off with him to the Philippines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pursue her down to the ranch because her father or brother might shoot him . He dismisses these sneaky thoughts . He believes her because he wants to believe her , because he ca n't equate such a lie with the look in her eyes and the passion with which she kisses him . He shoves the treacherous little notion back and away , he smothers it in anticipations , he obscures it with fantasies of pure young love in a paradise oasis among the red cliffs.  |p177Exce|pt  for the wrinkles in it , the sweater might have been brand-new . He held it up and looked for holes , sniffed the wool for the smells of preservation : neither moths nor mothballs had been there . The thing might have come straight from its original Utah Woolen Mills box . Mason could n't remember whether or not he had ever seen Nola wear it . At least she had n't given it to Bailey . Laying it aside , he picked up the two bundles of letters , one tied with string , one with a piece of brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , times when she let it down and bound it behind her head . When she sat at the piano it hung down her back in a thick , dark-chestnut sheaf like a horse 's tail , clear to the bench . As between those tied with string and those tied with ribbon , he chose those tied with ribbon . They were not , he saw , chronologicallyarranged , only bundled together . Put in order and read consecutively , they might make a sort of sickly Sturm and Drang novel , a decaffeinated Sorrows of Young Werther or Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre . He was certainly not going to read them through . He might look at the top one . It was postmarked March 4 , 1931 . That would have been onlyp178a little while after he got back to Minneapolis from Chet 's funeral . At Christmas he had n't been able to go home because the banks had all failed , and the savings of more than four years at the Mulder Nursery had gone in one blow , crossed out . Lesson number one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to spend with Nola in Salt Lake he spent in Minneapolisin the company of other threadbare students , eating crackers and cottage cheese , and milk kept cold on the window ledge , and reading , reading , reading , boning up in hornbooks , reviewingtorts and contracts and crimes in preparation for February 's exams , and putting in a systematic three hours a day on general books calculated to improve his mind . Aristotle just then , as he recalled : Poetics , Ethics , and Politics , one after the other  --  books he had managed never to hear of during his undergraduate years , and as unrelated to his immediate life as the Harvard Classics philosophers he had read when he was fifteen . Then , at the end of January , on the eve of examinations , came the telegram announcing the last of Chet 's misfortunes and mistakes . Lesson number two followed so fast upon number one that he hardly had time to set his feet . Like his catch-up reading , his instruction in real life had much ground to cover in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good-natured , he would not have worked up a sweat on a cold and windy day , helping dig somebody 's car out of the snow at the Ecker ski-jumping hill outside of Park City . If he had been born luckier , he would have waited to catch pneumonia until after antibiotics had tamed it . Being generous , unlucky , and ill-timed , he dug and pushed , he got overheated , he fell sick , and he died within six days . " I 'm leaving you the dirty work , Ma , " he told his mother a few hours before he drowned in his own secretions . Then he escaped from his future , which was drab , and his marriage , which was in trouble , and abandoned to the responsibility of others the daughter he had conceived before he was legally a man . Bruce came home to a week of clenched misery . Chet 's wife had gone to pieces , his father ate his own vitals in guilt and selfblame , his mother tried to hold them both up , Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took that death hardest . He had always liked Chet better than Bruce . Chet was an extensionp179of himself , wholly masculine , big-chested , unbookish , an athlete . Even after the runaway marriage and the subsidence into odd jobs and semipro baseball , the dream of the big chance , big leagues , big success , had never quite died for either of them . It was like the game of swatting the baby with a pillow : the old man never realized it was n't going well until it had gone all to pieces . He never knew how he felt about Chet until Chet was dead . Every night Bruce heard him moaning in nightmares , and his mother 's voice as she tried to wake him to a reality as bad as his dreams . Death closed their closed family in upon itself more than ever ; they were as impervious as a spore . There was no room for Nola among them . Bruce had to find time for her separately , which was not easy . She was tied down by classes and practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , when her own work was done and when his parents had gone to bed so that he could borrow the car . Their hours together were somber . Though she was sympathetic , and cried for his trouble , it was the renewed separation that she feared . She could n't make anything out of their brief bleak reunion for thinking how soon it would end . He could give her only scraps of himself . His mind was always back at the house where his mother would be lying sleepless , waiting for the next installment of his father 's nightmare and hoping for the sound of Bruce 's key in the door . Through the months in Minneapolis , Nola had been an anguish in his blood , he had been swollen with visions ; but while he was at home they never even tried to make love . There was no place , and anyway Chet would have lain like an accusation between them . All they did was sit in the cold car and torment one another with abortive touching , and kisses that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night he picked her up after dinner and they sat up on Wasatch Boulevard in the white cold , under the cold mountains , huddling and kissing and promising . He talked about the next summer and all they would do , but in the middle of his Pollyanna spiel she put her hands to his face , cupping it and staring into his eyes , and cried in her husky voice , " Oh , do you have to go back there ? I ca n't stand it if you go away again ! " And here , something odd . He had been utterly miserable in Minneapolis . With no gift for the law 's precisions , and un/dereducated to begin with , he had compensated by a monoma  --  niac diligence . He went nowhere except to classes and the library , he took no exercise , he ate in twenty minutes in order to get back to the books . In spite of the monotonous bland things he ate , his ulcer was a constant reminder under his wishbone . He was away from everything that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrenched with more love than it could hold , he was blackly lonesome . And yet when she begged him not to go back , he had not a moment 's hesitation . Of course he was going back . He would stick it out , and she should , too , and eventually they would get their postponed reward . Four more months , and then all summer together . Another nine months , and together for good . He would find a place in some local law firm , or hang out his own shingle . Mason could hardly believe his own naivete . What had he thought he was going to do ? Arrange little divorces ? Settle little real estate squabbles ? Draft little wills ? Litigate little disputes about water rights , or breaches of contract or promise ? That last was probably it . Breach of promise was very big about that time . Many a female heart , inspired by Peaches Browning , was exposingits injuries to sympathetic juries . It was fantastic that he should ever have thought his future might lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he had been pushed by people eager to do him a favor . He had no more initiative in his career than water has on a slope . Nevertheless , once started , he would have felt it immoral  --  unthinkable  --  to stop before the end . He would get his degree and come back . They would be married and build a house , or maybe only a basement at first , in the Salt Lake Depression style  --  a roofed-over foundation in which they would live until they could afford to build the first floor . Just Molly and me and baby makes three . Question : Why that mule headed inertia ? Answer : In the first place , he was mule-headed . He hated to back up , start over , change direction . To this day he drove that way , gerade aus like a German , despising the people who dart from lane to lane . Moreover , he was used to delayed rewards . He knew something about having to work for what he wanted , and even more about frustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fatalist in him , too . He mistrusted the rewards that he would break his neck to win . He half expected to fail even though experience should have taught him that most of the time he did not . In his bones he knew that the world owed him nothing . Some part of him was always preconditioned to lose . And though he felt himself superior to his background , and capable of some vague unspecified distinction , he knew himself unworthy . He was a sticker because it was easier to dig in and be overrunthan to attack and be repulsed . To Nola he had said nothing about any of that . He did n't know himself that well . Also , he had hope . When you live by daily postponements , you had better have hope . It did n't help that on that last night he felt he had to take her home at ten so as to spend the last hour or so with his parents . The next morning , when he kissed her goodbye at the Union Pacific station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were bottomless . Sad ? Resentful ? He could n't tell . He never could read her eyes . Now here was this letter written from Minneapolis a few weeks after he left her for the second time . He wished Aunt Margaret had managed to preserve something else , his letters to his mother or Joe , a diary , old papers , photographs , anything . To reconstruct that time from these letters alone was like trying to make a composite drawing of a suspect from the evidence of a single witness . He is still running books past his eyes , a random sampling of the wildest variety : Longinus ' On the Sublime , Heroes and Hero Worship , The Origin of Species and The Voyage of the Beagle , Freud 's Totem and Taboo , Andreyev 's The Seven That Were Hanged . These are his after-study-hours reading . He confides that before turning off his light about two every morning , he gives himself a German lesson , reading a page , with the help of a dictionary , from Also Sprach Zarathustra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gog . Strange , strange , and far off . Even the handwriting strikes him as strange . Most people 's handwriting , he believes , grows more angular and irregular as they age , like the shapes of old pine trees . His , on the contrary , has grown more precise . It is demoralizing to see this impetuous scrawl and know it for hisp182own . It is even more demoralizing to read what this boy sees fit to say to his girl , frantically signaling from his isolation to his desire . He is excruciating . His letter is a desperate patter chorus of puns , doggerel , snatches of languages he does not know . Embarrassedto speak seriously of what he respects and covets , he describes professors as vacuum cleaners full of air , dust , and dead flies . Poverty , exile , and the death of a brother have taught him nothing . He sounds seventeen , not twenty-one . And if Mason were the girl this boy is writing to , he would notice one thing : though he is bitter against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter , like that score card of books he has read in the past week , is about what his exile is teaching him . He speaks less of his losses than of his gains . Dull fare for an unintellectual girl left behind in Salt Lake City , as dull as Yeats on fairies or Schopenhauer on suffering . Would she have felt that this compulsive self-improvement of Bruce Mason 's , which she can not know is half-baked and only semi-directed , threatens what she wants and what he says he wants ? Would she feel the torque of foreign books , foreign ideas , working on his provincial innocence ? He reminds Mason of one of those little toy apes made of cloth and fur , with painted grins and rubber-band insides . Twist the rubber bands tight and set this anthropoid on a table and he will begin to writhe and contort himself toward uprightness . A hand or foot will catch and brace , the body will lift , the head will come up . Then something will slip and down he will go again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stay there . The body goes on writhing , begins to come up , struggles to stand , is almost standing . Then flop , he is flat again , but his fixed indomitable grin is already stirring with mindless persistence upward , a paradigm of evolution . The quintessentially deculturated American , born artless and without history into a world of opportunity , Bruce Mason must acquire in a single lifetime the intellectual sophistication and the cultural confidence that luckier ones absorb through their pores from earliest childhood , and unluckier ones never even miss . He is a high jumper asked to jump from below ground level and without a run , and because be is innocent and has the temperamentof an achiever he will half kill himself trying.  |p183And  Nola Gordon is what ? She has no real interest in high jumping . She likes to sit and let the sun shine on her , and sing . What could she have made of his idiotic way of signing off ? Where his feeling might be laid miserably bare , he has to ham it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact I might say , withoutfear of successful contradiction , je t'aime . Or even Ocis aAair &.; " How preposterous . Irritated , Mason denies his acquaintance . Whatever happened to him , he deserved it . Then he turns the last sheet over , and there is a postscript . Ah , darling , only 87 days till the first of June ! My calendarlooks like the Prisoner of Chiffon 's . I make friends with mice and spiders to keep from thinking about you . We 've got to go down to the Capitol Reef again this summer , or to Fish Lake , or the Aquarius , or some other place empty and beautiful . You deserve that kind of setting . I want to see you bare in the moonlight . I want to touch you  --  but look out . My touch would raise blisters , and the kisses I 've been saving for you could cause third degree burns . My God , it drives me crazy to think . I know a place in the Ontario Basin , just over the divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not like the last time we were in Brighton . That makes me miserableevery time I remember it ) . Or there 's a little lake halfway along the old tramway between Brighton and Park City . Even if we both have to work this summer ( and did I tell you Joe spoke to his dad , and even though times are terrible he says I can have my old job back ? ) those places are close enough for weekends . We could drive up to Brighton or Park City on Saturday night after work , and hike in . Oh , keep your heart warm ! I dreamed the other night that I came home on a cold morning and you would n't start . One letter is enough to depress him . It brings back that whole frantic , lonely , expanding winter , those ulcer-diet meals of cottagecheese and milk and mashed potatoes and bread and ice cream , those late half hours of communion each night before hep184climbed into bed with Nietzsche or Tieck , those bleak visits to the post office when the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to manage two letters a week . He ties up the bundles and tips the box to put them back in . There remains the manila envelope . When he undoes its metal clasp , snapshots slide onto the spread . His first impulse was not to look at them . There were advantagesto being orphaned away from the past . Evidence might be hard on the sell-protective memory . Just now , in a single letter , Bruce Mason had so embarrassed his mature descendant that the descendant shrank from the relationship . He felt a derisive unwillingnessthat verged on distaste , like a Victorian cleric trying to reconcile himself to descent from an ape . What if Nola Gordon , too , should turn out to have been an absurdadolescent , callow , provincial , not beautiful , not mysterious , not in any way worth the disturbance she caused ? The memory , Mason had discovered , is deceptive and self-serving , and could blur faces as it could blur other things . What if he turned these snapshots over and found that Nola was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had inventedher ? What if the fashions of the early Depression years turned her into a frump ? But he was engaged in laying ghosts , not only the ghosts of his luckless parents and the ghosts of old girl friends , but the ghosts of old innocence , inexperience , possibility . His innocence had always been flawed by self-doubt , and only those years of delusive security , when he had been **27;6429;TOOLONG , had lured him into the open . When the boot came down , he had crawled back under his rock dragging his squashed guts . Not that he needed healing , or ever had . He took the blows that fell on his family and himself because he expected them . The world owed none of them anything , and no few years of relativegrace had convinced him otherwise . He had read Epictetus ; he was a Stoic by destiny and choice . And he was not , afterward , driven to wipe all that out of his mind . It was only the girl he wiped out , and her he systematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as because he was ashamed to have been a fool , and by no means a guiltless one.  |p185Now  he flinched away from looking at these photographs and refreshing the face of his temptation . He was reconciled to having been a fool , but at least he wanted the temptation to have been irresistible . The photographs lay face down . He turned over the top one and there she was , smiling from the doorway of a little log cabin . She wore riding breeches and boots , a white shirt open at the throat , a black Stetson pushed back on her head . Beside her , a wagon wheel leaned against the log wall ; above her head , a nail wore a bouquet of binder twine . The interior of the cabin shadowed backward in dim crisscrosses of hay . The face looking at him was heavier and more Indian-looking than he remembered it , but he could see why it used to interrupt the beating of his heart . The eyes were candid under severe dark brows . The mouth was curved in a Gioconda smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one roll from his old bellows Kodak . One print was so over-exposed that all detail was washed out . Two were of a crowd  --  the wedding crowd  --  spread across the grass under the cottonwoods , selfconsciouscountrified strangers not even forgotten because never known , but once studied gingerly as potential relatives by marriage . When you marry into a Mormon family you marry tribes and nations . Here are the bride and groom , she in a best dress , her hair directfrom the beauty parlor , he wearing a Tom Mix shirt and a dazed smile . Flanking them , the bride 's daughter , father , and brother Buck . Buck 's hard face is a younger version of his father 's , curly dark hair an earlier stage of curly gray . Both have the beaks of hawks and eyes that bore into the camera like the eyes of zealot grandfathers in old tintypes . In the next one , Buck is smiling broadly , a movie cowboy . He and Nola sit their horses in front of a cross-bedded sandstone cliff on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pecked outlines of petroglyphs  --  deer with exaggeratedantlers , mountain sheep with curled horns . The teeth of brother and sister are white in their dark faces . They sit their horses with the easy weight of sacked grain . Their thighs , pressed against the saddles on the side toward the camera , swell against the cloth , his against tight Levi 's , hers against thep186tailored twill of her breeches . Riding breeches are the only kind of pants he ever saw her in . In those years women did not wear pants , even Levi 's , and even on ranches . Now here are Nola Gordon and Bruce Mason on the top bar of a corral , a picture taken by Buck just before they started back , presumably to Salt Lake . Her eyes are slanted sideward , and she is laughing . Bruce leans back , pretending to be toppling off . His face is the face of one who trusts his life . Both look clean , open , happy , and incredibly young . Did Nola return these snapshots to remind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , or what they had done to each other ? If so , her gesture was as futile as a telephone ringingin an empty house . Probably she was simply clearing her life of whatever trash he had left behind . He remembered her carryingthat box up Joe Mulder 's steps , wearing the implacable expression that had been on her face when she looked Eddie Forsberg out her door and on his way . But then why this last picture , Nola barefooted and barelegged , lifting her skirts high to clear the water of the ditch in which she is wading ? To remind him of her body ? Or of an occasionand a ceremony and a promise ? The light is early , the shadowsare flat and long . Above the waist she is wearing only a brassiere , and on her face is a look of laughing dismay that is not dismay at all , but excitement . In this snapshot her face is as vivid as Holly 's . If it was meant as a reminder , it was the right one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father 's funeral , and it reminds him now : morning in Eden . Just after he ambushed her with the camera , he splashed after her and caught her in person , and in the middle of the knee-deep water , in his new exultance of possession , laid his hand on her bare midriff and his mouth on her mouth . Mason squeezed his eyes shut , easing the strained muscles . It must be one-thirty . Enough of all this . He put the photographs back into their envelope and the envelope and letters back into the box , and set the box down on the floor . The sweater weighed on his feet , and he kicked it off . He turned off the past with the light . With his eyes open , he watched how the blackness of the roomp187turned imperceptibly to modulations of gray , itself like a faded photograph  --  vague bureau , shadowy desk and chair , ghostly doorways leading to bathroom and closet . He could not feel himself in any specific time or place . This was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 1977 , but some place that was typical without being defined . He had slept in this bed all over the world . A late car passing in the street might have been passingunder the windows of a room in London or Washington or Cairo , Tehran or Beirut or Amman , anywhere along the confused unedited newsreel of his life . The wheels rolled backward , images flowed and dissolved . He was asleep , but he might as well have been awake , for the pictureswere the same , sleeping or waking  --  little movies in which he was both actor and camera . He took a trip he had taken before , he attended two weddings , one sanctified in shirt-sleeve piety , the other consummated in awe . Dreaming , he continued the pilgrimage that he had begun when he rounded the corner of the Oquirrhs and saw shining against its mountains the city of his youth . Sleeping , he was troubled by the same feelings of nostalgia and loss and rueful wonder that had attended him all day . That this boy should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his naivete and egotism and innocence should persist so long and so unchanged . That he should understand it and be cured of it but still contain it . That calf love , like childhood unhappiness and boyhood self-mistrust , like mother love and fatherhate , like everything else that had got fed into his computer in those impressionable years , should be so helplessly a thing that lasts . He is flying , not at all surprised at being able to fly , with the Atman guide Khamis ibn Rimthan . His name means Thursday , and he can not get lost . In his head is a gyroscopic compass . Set him in the middle of an unknown waste and ask the direction and distance of any landmark  --  anything as far as Mecca or as near as the flint desert called the Abu Bahr , the Father of the Sea  --  and he will point and tell you , " Till tomorrow evening in your truck , " or " Six hard days by dhalul . " He has crossed the Rub ' al Khali north-south and east-west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has led Aramco 's geologists clear to the plain of Muttia , where the al-Murrah tribesmen drink camel 's milk because all the wells are salt . They say of him that he could bury a rupee in a traveling dune and come back five years later and find it . It seems that Khamis is taking him to his native region , and that in some confusing way he must have gone this route before , for he recognizes things . The water that spreads to the horizon , rounding its brilliant turquoise into a glittering salt plain , is surely Great Salt Lake . And yet as they swoop over the saltworks toward Saltair , the buildings and the long dikes of salt blur into a cluster of barastis on the flats , the domed pavilion dead ahead might be some **25;6458;TOOLONG mosque , the Saltair causeway becomes an arrowy fish trap projecting into the PersianGulf , and Arabs are washing ticks off their camels on the flat shore . Now all that falls behind . They are flying against a stiff wind in a country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is wearing the agal  --  and he can distinctly hear the edges of the cloth pop and flutter as they speed along . But it can not be cloth he hears . It is the noise of his old Model A , laboring along a desert track , in immense highlands , up a slope that steepens and steepens toward the vertical . In alarm he looks at Khamis , but Khamis nods and smiles and motions him on . His hands are frozen to the wheel . What was terrifyingly steep is near vertical , past vertical . The earth curls backward like an enormous river wave , the Ford goes on pulling this impossible grade , they curve smoothly up and over in a loop that is never completed . Gravity is in abeyance , panic locks his guts . Are they flying again ? No , far under him , or above him , are the trestles of the Saltair roller coaster , and the thunder that he hears is from wheels , and the whistle of air past his ears is remembered from his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salt Lake from Montana . Weightless , drunk with space , terrified , he soars up and over , endlessly over , looping the loop , wheeling with the universe . They they are still . Somehow they have surmounted or escapedit . They stand on a terrific rim in a wind that blows silently out of time , silently but so strongly that they stoop andp189cling to avoid being blown off the earth . All around the edges of the world , concentric lines of cliffs rise rim beyond rim . Their colors are red-gold , rust , chocolate , sulphur yellow , coppery blue-green ; their profiles are familiar and evasive . The rock they stand on , he sees , is a cameo butte , all that is left at the center of an eroded dome as long and wide and high as a mountain range . He is uneasy , as in a game where he does n't know the rules , and he asks Khamis , " Where are we ? Circle Cliffs ? Tuwaiq Escarp-ment ? " Instead of answering , Khamis points down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sunny stone , glows a tiny green spot , a Memling miniature landscape . He sees it with the eye of an eagle or buzzard , uncannily sharp and precise , clearly lighted : green meadows , buildings and roofs , a double loop of creek , the angular sculpture of corrals , even tiny animals of a remarkable verisimilitude . Recognition and gladness come together . It is the remembered place of his boyhood , the sunken river bottoms of the Whitemud , in Saskatchewan . He says something to Khamis , and finds that Khamis is slyly smiling . With the changefulness of water flawed by wind , his face alters and softens , his hawk 's beak gentles . He puts up a hand and removes the ghutra and reveals under it long red hair in a braid . His smile is complex ; he looks at Mason with his mother 's blue eyes . The wind , blowing against him , outlines under his robe the breasts and hips of a woman . " Ahl " Mason cries in love and relief . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowns . The wind presses her robes against her and shows the flatness where her left breast should be . Her brows are dark , level , and severe ; her hair is not red , but brown and shining . Her eyes come closer , growing larger until they fill his whole vision . As if he were an insoluble puzzle , they search , probe , question , wonder . They are waveringly steady ; the light in them darkens and changes but the insistent gaze is not withdrawn . Softly , in a voice of husky sweetness , she begins to sing . The tune he knows but can not name . The words he recognizes : " I have kissed thy mouth , lokanaan , I have kissed thy mouth ! " As smoothly as an elevator they are sinking down . From below , deep in its protected pocket , the Memling landscape risesp190toward them , growing swiftly larger , and as it rises it changes through a series of recognitions . The enclosing walls are the bench hills above the valley of the Whitemud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle Valley , and almost at once they rise grandly in the red , white-capped wave of the CapitolReef . The green core rushing upward burns an ever more intensegreen . It rushes toward him , or he toward it  --  safety , illusion , lost Paradise , whatever it is . He is filled with anticipation and dread . The screen breaks up in shapes of flame . Everything is a red flickering . He is in a movie theater , and in the projection booth the film has caught fire . Aware of the cold , he looks around him and sees that he is alone in the theater . Groggily he gropes and finds the edge of the blanket and pulls it up . The pillow is wet from his mouth , and he rolls over . Almostadmitted , not wanted , the hollow hotel room hums and recedes . The dream , if it is really a dream and not unsleeping memory , comes back as documentary.  |p191Like  a curious dog , the camera comes hunting along the welted bank of a ditch . It is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspects close-to-the-ground details . It dwells on the slow , spinningsurface of tea-colored water , it notes the dimpling tracks of skaters in the eddies , and the wakes that V down from rocks and clumps of half-drowned grass . It is not above spending a few seconds on a darning needle that sits on air for a moment and darts away a few feet to sit on other air . It wonders that a jimson weed is able to extract such rich dark foliage and such creamy trumpets of flowers from and sand . It ruminates without comment on an old boot , curled and mummified , beside the path . Now it arrives at a pole bridge , and above it a weir and the headworks of a branch ditch . The upper plank of the weir is raised , and water falls in a smooth curve over the lower one . The pool above is solid with watercress . Into the visual dream , stirred by some foot that the camera never discloses , and perceived by a nose for which there is no assignable body , rises the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sees that all along the left is a cliff of ' cross-bedded sandstone , frozen dunes in whose base the wind has eroded caves . Men have improved them by buildingp192corrals around them , trapping for the use of stock shallow areas of shelter . Two corral-caves are open and empty . In a third , a mare stands hipshot above her sprawled sleeping colt . In a fourth , three calves lie chewing the cud . With the same unlocatednose that detected the mint , we know the smell of those caves : horse and cow dung both dry and fresh , the sun-dried reek of urine , dust , some residual odor of sage and juniper . The sun falls straight down ; the band of shade in the caves is only eight or ten feet wide . Half buried in the pinkish sand is an OrangeCrush bottle . Poking along the cliff beyond the caves , the camera comes to a place where the face is vertical and stained with desert varnish . In this dark glazed surface primitive men have pecked the outlinesof deer and bighorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chalked petroglyphs is a band of handprints in red ocher . A sun-steeped richness of life pervades these noon corrals , this quiet ditch , this billboard cliff . The fingers ( though there are no fingers ) feel how tepid-cool the water would be if one stooped to dip a hand in it . The camera pans along the cliff , up it to its rounding rim , and with a gust as sudden as a wind that blows an umbrella inside out , we are looking high upward , away upward , to the rim of a level , lava-capped , spruce-spiked plateau . From a mile up , it looks down over this fertile desert . The interdependence is obviouswithout a caption . Up there is snow shed , summer range , a subalpine climate , recreation , coolness , relief . Up there is the source of this ditch that makes the desert live . Withdrawing , the camera inspects the sod-roofed stable , two long haystacks , and the pole corrals that lie below the main ditch , with the branch ditch flowing past them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open valley , whitefaces are gleaning a stubble field , perhaps winter wheat , that ends at a barbed-wire fence . On the other side of the fence , a car tows a horizontal funnel of dust along a road , and beyond the road , anotherline of cliffs holds the valley in on the south . This is not rounded and domed and monolithic like the cliff on the north . It has been eroded into a line of gargoyles and hoodoos , all leaning southward . The camera reasons that these are remnants of the outer shellp193of an enormous dome which wind and water have dissected to its salmon-pink heart , leaving the shell like a broken wall around the wilderness of stone inside . In there , the distance is hazed with transparent blue . It trembles with familiarity . Its cliffs and cameo buttes have been seen only moments ago . The mind gropes for identification , and finds it : The San Rafael Reef , leaninginward toward the waste of the San Rafael Swell . Robbers ' Roost , Butch Cassidy 's country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe ditch bank marked with the tracks of men and horses , and moves on until it is stopped by a fence made of slabs of ripple-marked sandstone set on end . Path and ditch go through the fence ; the pole gate is down . In the slabs to which gateposts have been bound by windings of baling wire ( Mormon silk , says some amused folklorist at the dream 's core ) there are brown ribby shapes of fossil fish , some of them a foot long . Inside the gate is deep shade . We are looking into a half acre of big Fremont poplars that lean over a log ranch house and all but obscure the cliff behind . Through the grove , quicksilver bright , the ditch flows through grass that must be periodicallyflooded to keep it so green . Scattered and clustered through the grove are fifty or sixty people . They make a picture like a Renoir picnic or a Seurat promenade sur l'herbe , but different , special , simpler and homelier , quintessentially redledgeMormon . The camera recognizes ranchers , farmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunnyside , beauticians from Price , schoolteachers from Castle Dale or Emery , rangers from the Manti-La Sal National Forest . Whoever they are , the women have been weathered by the same dry wind , and have bought their dresses from the same J. C. Penney store in Price , or from the ZCMI in Salt Lake at Conference time . Whatever trade the men practice , they all dress as cowboys , in boots , washed and ironed and faded Levi 's , and shirts with yokes and snap buttons . There are children of all ages , the boys small replicas of their fathers , the younger girls in white dresses with white stockings grass-stained at the knees . The yard has been raked and mown , but it is uneven , worn bare in spots , and already gathering a new drift of cottonwood fluff . Three old women sit in a swing lounge in the deepest shade . From a tree over by the cliff , an automo/bile tire has been hung on a lariat , and girl children are pushing each other in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff , and push out again , shrieking . Up the ditch , some boys throw a shepherd pup into the water . He crawls out dripping , yapping , and agog , and shakes himself on them . Yelling , they grab him and throw Mm in again . He loves it . He would happily drown , object of so much attention . In this crowd the camera finds the city boy , Nola 's young man , marked by his white corduroys and white buck shoes . The old women discuss him , girls eye him as they help set the long trestle tables near the house . He stands talking to Nola 's father about cattle , and alfalfa , and grazing permits , and water rights . The camera understands that these subjects are not those on which he is prepared to be voluble , but he listens well , and he remembers enough from Saskatchewan and Montana to make an occasional sensible remark . When someone calls Nola 's father away , the city boy falls into talk with her brother Buck . Their subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does better , since he has an honest admiration for any athletic skill and is , moreover , much less wary than with the old man , who makes him nervous . Soon the city boy and Buck go through the stone fence and on down to the stable . The old women watch them out of sight ; the camera watches the old women . Then we pick up the two around the stable corner . Three others are there , sneaking cigarettes . The city boy offers Buck a Lucky and takes one himself . Buck winks and leans and pulls out of the manger a partly emptied fifth of unlabeled red-eye . It goes around until it comes to Bruce Mason , who declines , using his ulcer as an excuse . The others clearly do not understand about ulcers and look at him as if afraid he might be pious . " I tell you , boy , " Buck says , " you ai n't gon na survive this struggle just on brute strength . " " Do n't encourage him , " another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they is for us to . I dearly love a man that do n't drink , myself . " The bottle goes around again . The next-to-last man , sensing shortage , takes it from his mouth , looks at it against the light , takes one more small sip  --  a tablespoonful  --  and regretfullyp195passes it to Buck , who drains it and throws it over his shoulder without looking . It smashes against the log wall . " Who Hang that ? " a man asks . They laugh . One of them leans around the corner to look . " About ready to start , up there , I guess . " " Maybe we better git back , " Buck says , and steps on his cigarette . " Come on , boy , you 're family . " He whacks Bruce on the shoulder and leaves his arm there as they walk together back to the sandstone fence and into the shade . The old women watch , noting the fraternal acceptance . A sort of order is shaping out of the colored chaos under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselvesaround a large genial man in white shirt and arm garters  --  the bishop  --  who pushes and pulls at the air , beckoning them in or moving them back . Women leave their work in the kitchen and at the tables and come over , untying apron strings and looking around for their children . The three men whom Bruce and Buck have left behind at the stable come up the slope and drape themselves warily on the sandstone fence at the very edge of things . Chatterers bore on into the growing quiet until they become aware and fall still . Women stoop and fiercely yank up their daughters ' stockings and yank down their dresses . A loose aisle has formed , leading toward the kitchen door . The whiteshirtedbishop folds his arms and waits , smiling . Heads turn like sunflowers , and the bride is at the kitchen door , in soft focus behind the screen . Her dress , greener than the grass , is unkind to her coloring , which is doubtful in any case because her brows are dark like Nola 's and her hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though she is weathered and not young , is really quite a homely woman with bony , too large features ( that Southern Paiute inheritance ? ) , the camera notes her resemblance to Nola . A stranger might think her Nola 's mother . Her smile is tense . She opens the screen and steps down onto the sandstone slab that serves as a doorstep . Coming after her , the groom lets the screen door slam , and winces at the noise , raising his narrow shoulders and grinning guiltily and drawing sympathetic laughter . He is the only person there who wears a coat . He wears , inp196fact , a suit , black and ironed stiff . His boots , new , are outlined under the narrow legs of his pants . Through the collar of his checked cowboy shirt he has run a necktie from behind , so that in the opening where there would normally be a knot there is only a band of patterned silk . The ends of the tie must hang down his back , under his coat , like pigtails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy and plastered down . His upper lip is cracked , and he keeps touching it with , the tip of his tongue. he screen opens again and Nola and Buck , maid of honor and best man , step down behind the bride and groom . Buck 's maroon silk shirt glows against the gray logs like an exotic flower . Nola in a dress of soft yellow looks cool , serene , removed from all the stress of this marrying . The camera suffers a pang of pride and love , just looking at her . Without intending to , she makes the bride and groom look like yokels . Her eyes go out over the crowd until they find Bruce . Then she smiles a small private smile , throws it like a rosebud , and as he catches it he is enveloped in blue static . She should be the bride here . Is . Will be . There is only one marriage scheduled , but there will be two honeymoons . Buck has observed that smile , and who caught it . He says something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she gives him an admonitory nudge with her shoulder , not looking at him , still smiling her inward smile . The bishop nods , and the four on the doorstep , not unanimously , start forward . The bride turns her ankle in the rough grass and makes an exasperated , self-conscious grimace . In the front row of watchers a girl of twelve or so stands up with a gasp and a sob . The bride 's daughter , even more tense than the bride . Promptly the woman above her wraps the girl in against her skirts . Pale , trapped , brimming , the girl watches as if at a hanging . Her mother stops before the bishop , adjusts her feet in the grass , squares her shoulders , looks around helplessly for some place to lay her bouquet , and with abrupt decision hands it back to Nola . The bridegroom , tonguing his cracked lip , leans forward slightly and peeks down the front of his trousers . " Darrell 's nervous , " the bishop says . Laughter , quickly hushed.  |p197Barely  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bishop nods . Aloud , he guesses comfortably that folks all seem to be here , they might as well get started . A random puff of wind moves and dies in the high tops of the poplars . A watching woman bats cotton out of her face without taking her eyes off the drama before her . The camera strays past the principals , looks out from the shade across the glaring valley and sees the leaning reef of hoodoos and goblins , and away beyond , the Swell crawling with heat , the color of cliffs and canyonsalmost discharged in the steep light . The clouds in the visiblearc of sky are rounded white above , flat below . " Now , before we get down to the proceedings , let me remind you of what we were saying before , " the bishop says . He speaks conversationally to the bride and groom , ignoring the spectators . ' When you 're married and settled down over there on the MinnieMaud , or for that matter if you should move anywhere else , whatever place you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mmmmmm ? Dig in and work and belong in it and do your share . " They stand before him like culprits , wearing the look of good Mormons hearkening to counsel . The camera , meantime , interpretsBruce Mason 's feelings . He looks upon his girl 's sister and her husband-to-be as hicks . He feels superior to them and to everyonethere unless perhaps Nola 's father and brother . The fatherstrikes him as a tough old bird with a gimlet eye , the brother as a good egg , skilled , worldly , and reckless . The rest are yokels . Yet he may not smile at these country Mormons , because they are her people , and she is loyal to them . All her life she has been the darling of this tribe . Her sister mothered her , half a dozen aunties anxiously spoiled her . She was the one who could sit down at the piano , even as a little girl , and play by ear any tune you wanted to name . She was the one who would pick up a guitar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by suppertime be playing the thing . She was the one who went off to the university in Salt Lake . He has seen the fond and yearning looks they give her . Because of her , they deserve his politeness if not his respect . He has also caught the women watching him , and seen theirp198speculative eyes . How serious are those two ? Is he good enough for her ? Somebody said he is n't LDS . That 's bad . But perhaps he could be brought to receive the Word ? He seems in other ways like a well-spoken , pleasant young man . An impostor , he knows that every single aspect of his background , if it were known , would be a black mark against him , and their solidarity makes him half envious . He feels how satisfyingit would be to belong to some tribe or family , and though he feels superior to this one , he does not dismiss the notion of a not unfriendly alliance . Can he imagine being married here himself  --  in this grove , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? His mother , yes , she could make contact with anybody . Chet would be at home with the boys back of the stable . But his father is unthinkable here . He belongs out in the Robbers ' Roost , not in this green and pious oasis . " This marriage is n't just yours , you see , " the Bishop is saying . " I 'm sure you both understand that . Other people have an interestin it , too . Mmmm ? The community has an interest in it because you 'll be part of it , and it has a right to expect you to live up to your obligations . The state has an interest in it because it 'll have you registered , all your records will be there . And the Church has an interest in it because through it your marriage is sanctified . " Around the edge of the bridegroom 's hair , like a scalping scar , runs a line of unsunburned white . This is probably the first time he has had his hat off , except to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barber has shaved his neck round . Down by the corralsa calf is bawling . The woman with her arms around the bride 's daughter frowns in annoyance , willing the creature still . " All right , then , " the bishop says . " You understand all that . Now , Darrell , you take Audrey by the right hand . Audrey , you take Darrell . That 's it . Now . By the authority in me vested as an Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , I declareyou man and wife . " It comes too quickly . Everyone is confused , including the principals . They look uncertainly at the bishop , who has to motion Buck to step forward with the ring . The bishop takes it from him and hands it to Darrell , who fumbles and nearly drops it from his tonglike fingers , and then has trouble shoving it over Audrey'sknuckle.  | " Darrell is nervous , " the bishop says with a wide smile . A black cat with its tail in the air walks around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flares in the eyes of one of the watching women , and with her skirts she tries to shoo it back . But her move is too hesitant , inhibited by the occasion , and the cat comes on down the line , rubbing against legs , watched by all , until a little girl stoops quickly and lifts it . Its hind legs and tail hang down , an inert weight , against the white confirmation dress . The bride 's daughter weeps steadily , copiously , not quite silently . The woman holding her makes an exasperated face and hands down a wadded handkerchief . The girl takes it , weeps , wipes . " You may now kiss each other , " the bishop says . Violently the bride flings herself against the bridegroom 's chest . The contrast between her worn vulnerability and Nola 's composure confirms for Bruce Mason how far she has outgrown her origins . All around , those origins are wet-eyed . Sheepishly the husband wraps his new wife around . Suspended , with drowning eyes , the daughter stares . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Nola , holding the bridal bouquet on her arm , but her eyes are for her sister , not for him . The crowd stands , embarrassed and fulfilled . Nobody dares to break the tableau . Then Audrey pulls her homely wet face away from Darrell 's Tom Mix shirt and cries accusingly , " Well , why do n't somebody say something , instead of standin ' there watchin ' me cry ! " Laughter is sympathetic and relieved , inertia is broken . The daughter comes running and desperately clings to her mother 's leg . Nola , then Buck , then their father , kiss the bride . The women kiss embarrassed Darrell , the men pump his hand . Two women quietly retrieve their aprons from behind the swing and , tying strings as they go , head for the kitchen . " Look this way , Audrey , " a woman says , and raises a camera . People fall back out of the line of fire . A man says , " It 's too dark in the shade here , Ede . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No , it ai n't , I 've got this thing . " Near her a half-grown boy , serious as a dynamiter 's assistant , holds aloft a tray of flash powder . People back off further , re/spectful of advanced technology , while the bride assembles herself , dabs , blinks , laughs , grabs Darrell on one side and her daughter on the other , and freezes as stiff as the girl from whose head the crack shot shoots glass balls in a Wild West show . " Wait ! " Darrell says . He tears off his coat and rips the necktie out of his collar and tosses them to someone in the crowd . Cheers . " Smile , now , " the camerawoman says . " Say ' prunes . " She peers , squints , is on the brink . Prunes . Click , but no flash . Uncertainly she looks up . " Did n't it go ? " Voices assure her that it did n't . She winds the film . The boy stares aggrievedly into his tray of flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prunes . Click . Again no flash . " Why , what 's the matter with the blame thing ? " the camerawoman says . Buck disconnects the flash boy , to the boy 's disgust . " Try it over in the sun , where you do n't need that contraption . Come on , Aud , get that lucerne-wrangler over here . " Bruce follows along , opening his camera . At the grove 's edge the bride , with restrained violence , wipes her daughter 's nose and hisses at her to stop her bawling . The three freeze again , then unfreeze while Buck waves his father into the picture . " Where 's Junior ? " somebody asks . " Hell , " Buck says , " you wo n't get him in this . " He looks down into the finder . " Hey , And , ca n't you laugh ? " " I 'm smiling , " Audrey says grimly . Bruce , after a couple of frugal snapshots , saving his film for better things , comes up behind Nola and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turns with a smile which his instinct tells him is too open . Those old women do n't miss a thing . Yet he could n't be happier . It thrills him to have her turn to him that way . " I 've got to go help with the food , " she says a little breathlessly . " Save us places . Right at the end of the second table , there , by the ice-cream freezers . " " O.K. When do we start back ? " " They 'd think it was funny if we did n't stay a while . They 'll cut the cake right after we eat . Then I thought you and Buck and I might take a ride . " " All right . But do n't forget we 've both got to be back so wep201can get to work in the morning . Your aunties would n't want you driving late , without a chaperone . " They have drawn back against a tree , out of the crowd . Her eyes as she studies him are full of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil . You 've been down with Buck , sneakingdrinks behind the stable . He came up smelling like a saloon . " " Not me . I copped a smoke , is all . I observe the Word of Wis-dom . " " Yes , just the way the rest of them do . " As if the answers to important questions were written on him , she studies him . " How 's it going ? I saw you talking to Dad . " " We had a good talk about alfalfa and peaches and whiteface cattle and I told him about my childhood in Saskatchewan . He thinks I 'm a reformed cowboy . " " Reformed ! How do you think the wedding went ? " " Fine . It got a little juicy there for a minute . " " Poor Audrey . She 's scared . " " Scared why ? " " She was really in love with Elmo . She 'll never get over him . But she needs somebody to help bring up the kids . It was no good when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Darrell looks O.K. " " O.K. Not very exciting . " Like a child with a secret she smiles at him . " Not like what I 've got . " " You know something ? " " What ? " " You 're a darling . " " Just you keep thinking so . Do you know something ? " " Probably . " " They like you . Buck thinks you 're O.K. And Dad was leery about what I 'd bring down , but he told me you 're a very pleasantyoung fella . " " Is n't that kind of minimal ? Did n't he find me exciting ? " They commune privately under their tree while the crowd mills and jabbers . Seriously she says , " How does it seem down here to you ? Do you like it ? " " Like it ? Sure , it 's great . " " It 's better than great . Would you like it if we could run the ranch sometime ? "  | " A reformed cowboy like me ? Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about given up on Buck . " " What 's the matter with Audrey and Darrell ? " " They 've got all they can handle over on the Minnie Maud . " " I 'm a heathen . Would n't that bother them ? " " Not for long . Anybody that 's good enough for me is good enough for them . " " Ah , " he says . " Am I good enough for you ? " Her light frown warns him : somebody heading their way . He looks , and it is one of the men who helped kill Buck 's bottle . His Levi 's have been shrunk to his skinny legs . He has ten inches of wrong-side lighter cloth turned up for a cuff around his boots . " Well , " Bruce says , " we 'll have to see about that on the way back . " Her hand squeezes his arm , she turns and leaves him , moving with her incomparably physical , barefoot-woman 's walk . The lean man arrives and props himself against the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye is on Darrell , growing more uninhibited now that the formalities are over and his coat and tie off . Audrey stands at his elbow , hooked to him like a gate to its post . The lean man shakes his head . " Another good man gone wrong . " The camera wanders off among the million leaves of the grove , with only glitters of sun coming through them . Eventually it comes to rest on a length of railroad rail that hangs on a wire by the kitchen door . A hand bearing a tire iron comes into the pictureand beats with vigor on the rail . Men stand up with alacrity , the old women rise from their swing , children come pouring from all directions . Bruce Mason reaches the end of the second table just in time to save the end place , and then the one to the right of it , from a twelve-year-old boy who , twice balked but hardly noticing what has balked him , promptly dives under the cloth and comes up on the other side next to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women , Nola among them , make a procession from house to tables , bearing platters of fried chicken and corned elk , washbasinsof potato salad , dishpans of hot biscuits , bowls of watermelonpickle , chokecherry jelly , pickled peaches and apricots . One stands by a milk can of lemonade , filling pitchers with ap203dipper . Close behind Bruce four ice-cream freezers , though covered with a yellow horse blanket , radiate cold . Plates and platters go down the table , are emptied , are retrievedand carried back to the house for refilling . Eventually the procession slows . A woman sits down to eat , then another , only two or three anxious aunties standing ready for whatever need arises . Nola comes hurriedly to her seat , and Bruce stands up to tug her chair into place on the uneven ground . The bride 's daughter watches , fascinated , this demonstration of big-city politesse . On both sides of her , her girl friends are gnawing drumsticks and talking through them . One place down , the twelve-year-old is gobbling as if this might be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July . For a minute the bride 's daughter watches her friends with distaste and him with loathing . Unable to bear more , she leans around the girl next to her and says to him , " Eat with your fork ! " Her eyes , seeking corroboration and approval , come around to Nola , who smiles , and Bruce , who winks . Conspiracy of good manners . Now the feast is finished , the littered tables are abandoned . The freezers once filled with homemade peach ice-cream stand tilted and empty in their melting salt water , drawing flies . The drying shepherd pup is seeking out morsels under the tables . Audrey , with Darrell 's hand guiding hers , has cut the cake , and girls have carefully wrapped their pieces with the intention of taking them home and sleeping on them . There has been a lot of competitive pie-sampling : Elverna 's apple , LaVon 's peach , Aunt Vilate Chesnutt 's coconut cream . Beforethe men and boys have quite finished with that , Audrey in a crowd of women and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given everybody a fair chance . She has grooved it like a three-and-nothing fast ball into Nola 's hands . Tearfully now she makes her way around family and friends , her bony face blurred with crying , and kisses each in turn , some several times , crying , " Oh , God love you , God love you ! " She stands for a moment before Bruce , leans and kisses him quickly , says to him tensely , " I think it 's great ! You be good to her ! " and goes on by . The crowd lines up before the rarely used front door , making an aisle from it to the sandstone fence , on the other side of which waits Darrell 's pickup , the honeymoon vehicle . Buck , asp204best man , was supposed to guard it from pranksters , but instead has helped hang it with banners saying " Just married , " and through the holes in its perforated solid-rubber rear tires he has helped string tin cans on baling wire . With his own hands he has tied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionand kept carefully hidden in the springhouse , to the exhaustmanifold . Now the run through showers of rice , the yelled good wishes , the pandemonium as the pickup jerks away with its wheels trailing tin cans . Men whoop , women scream , dogs bark , dust rises in clouds . Safely down past the stable , Darrell hops out and yanks the wires loose from the wheels and hops in again . Audrey is wadding the " Just married " banners in her hands . They start up , a wadded banner flies out , Darrell raises his clenched fist and pokes it at the sky . Their dust goes down the valley road toward some destination which Darrell has been too cagey to reveal even to his treacherous best man . Dissolve . A moment of quiet . The dust settles . It is not the newlyweds who drive down the valley and whose dust drifts southward across the reef . It is not early afternoon , but later , five or six o'clock . The light is growing flatter , the shadows are beginning to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black pickup that the camera follows , but a gray Model A coupe with fender wells and a rear-bumper trunk , quite a snappy little heap . The two who ride in it , sitting close together in spite of the heat , are not sheepish or tearful , but young and glorified . The girl holds a bridal bouquet in her lap . The dreaming eye follows their dust down to a junction , turns right with them up a long hill , passes the summit and swoops with them down the switchbacks on the other side . When the driver has to double-clutch and shift down on a steep turn , takingthem smoothly around without so much as a minimum skid in the gravel , the girl hugging his arm hugs it tighter . " Good skinner , " she says . The camera loses them in a canyon and picks them up again as they top out at a great distance , buzzing along an elevated sagebrush plain above which rise the rounded shoulders of a higher plateau . Aspens are just leafing out on the high slopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They drag theirp205balloon of dust through little towns  --  Fremont , Loa , Bicknell  --  which seem to be inhabited exclusively by children on horseback who want to race . They round a corner under the colored cliffs of Thousand Lake Mountain , they pass through Torrey , they bore like a corkscrew into the rock along the Dirty Devil . On their left , the Capitol Reef rises . Its lower cliff is already in the shadow of the western wall ; its domed white rim is still in light so brilliant that the eye squints against it . The canyon widens and flattens . They are in a pocket of green among red cliffs . A dusty track turns off left . " Here , " the girl says , and the driver swings the wheel . They bump down the ruts toward a grove of trees and stop against a ditch . The leaves hang heavy , individual , heart-shaped , dark green , utterly still . The ditch runs clear knee-deep water . Across it , filling the bottomland to the foot of the cliff , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ripening fruit . Just between cottonwoods and orchard is an old house of squared logs , doorless , its inside crammed with hay , a broken wagonwheel leaning against the jamb , a clutch of binder twine on a nail above the wheel . There is a dense , unnamed familiarity : we have known this place before . Into the stillness that sifts down on them like feathers , a canyonwren drops its notes , musical as water . The ditch chuckles and guggles to itself under its banks . Down the canyon from the high plateaus , feeling its way toward the desert , comes the first stir of evening breeze . The dreamer yearns and strains against an overwhelming sensibility . He is as susceptible as poor homely Audrey . He leans to kiss the girl beside him , but there is an encumbrance , and looking down , he sees with a shock that he is holding something alive and crippled , a big fierce scared bird that struggles against his hold and pecks his hands . In the enclosed car he ca n't let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trouble hanging on to it . Indecision rises toward panic . What will he do with the thing ? Open the window and throw it out ? Wring its neck ? Cram it down between brake and gearshift and put his foot on it ? The girl 's eyes are on him , full of growing aversion , and he is ashamed.  |p206His  shame awakens him , but he resists being awakened . With his knees under his chin he burrows back and down , wanting to pick up the dream where it was broken , deal with this buzzard or whatever it is , take that look off Nola 's face and get on with the consummation he knows is coming . But though his half-conscious mind can remember it , his unconsciousrefuses to dream it . Some censor forbids this movie . Dream and girl repudiate him , or he them . He finds that he ca n't evoke her face , much less her body , shivering and damp and goose-pimpled from their clip in the ditch , crowding against him , growing warmer , stopping her shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottonwoods . She blurs and evades him until in the end he lies quiet and lets her go . The room hangs in its small-hours stillness above the stillness of the street . He feels bleak and old , done with , excluded and a failure , and is angry with himself for feeling so . For the dream , now that he has come fully awake , he neither wants nor believes . It lies to him about himself and it lies about the episode it pretendsto recall . Some inferiority or self-doubt has been warping the facts in order to prove something . There was no repudiation then , and no failure . However fumbling and green he was , he was not unsuccessful , nor was Nola unwilling . The end of that initiation was not disappointment but a great grateful tenderness . Still the censor bans the rerun . The trouble with the censor is that it knows too much . It has another , and much longer , and presumably far more important life to remember and keep under control . It is wary about acceptingthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It knows that the girl and first love are both victims , and so is the boy who took them joyriding . They cluster at the edge of consciousness like crosses erected by the roadside at the place of a fatal accident.  | " So what are you saying ? " asked some interlocutor in some anteroomof sleep . " That it was n't just a Dear John situation ? That you got really hurt ? " " No , " Mason said . " That 's not what I 'm saying . " " She left a mark on you . " " A heart with an arrow through it . " " If she did n't mean anything , why could n't you finish that dream ? " " Embarrassment . I 'm too old to be having erotic dreams . And of course she did mean something . She meant a great deal , then . " " You keep saying you 're a thing that lasts . You know what the Red Queen said to Alice . " " What ? " " ' It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " It must mean something , or he would not have worked it into this conversation . But he could n't make sense of it , and let it go . Finally his interlocutor  --  he perceived that it was both Holly and the woman of the St. Georges terrace , and that she was smiling at him with a certain fondness and with an air of sympathetic and ironic knowledge  --  said , " You 're like a nailhead that 's beenp208painted over . You think you 're all covered up , but I can still see you under there . She was the biggest thing in your life , and she threw you down . " " And I recovered . I 'd have recovered faster if she had n't chosento unload me just when my family was being wiped out , too . " " But you worshiped her , did n't you ? When she let you go to bed with her it was like a religious experience . " " Yes . All right . But let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a broken head . She wounded me where I was most vulnerable , in my vanity and my self-confidence . She preferred another lover . She was a grown woman with a body and I was a boy with brains . The body always says hurry , the brains may say wait . When I went away she found out that she hated being on the shelf like a purchase with a deposit on it . She had desires that would n't let her wait . I could have waited indefinitely , no matter what I said or thought . " " Could you ? You just admitted she was like a religious experience . You think sex is holy , do n't you ? " " Not the way I see it in the movies and in the lives of my juniorcolleagues . " " Ought to be holy , then . " " Sure , it ought to be . I 'm that old-fashioned . Mystery , the profoundest agitation and self-sacrifice . Nothing to be cheapened or played with . Not just a jazzy incident on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what you did n't like about Jack Bailey . " " Did n't like but could n't help being fascinated by . " " Why did n't you ever many ? " " Mainly because as soon as I got out of law school I took a job off in a country where the native women went veiled and stayed behind walls , and where there were n't any others . Even if I had been anywhere where I might have met a woman I wanted to marry , Saudi Arabia was no place to take a wife . By the time it all opened up after the war , I was petrified in my bachelor habits . Get it out of your head that Nola spoiled me for all future women . We had a brief affair . " " Was it so brief ? All summer . You went to that wedding at the beginning of June and you did n't go away to school until Sep-tember. "  | " But it was 1930 , " he reminded her or himself . " In Salt Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be careful of . Nola 's apartment was always full of roommates and their dates . In those days there were n't any motels . In a hotel , in a town the size of Salt Lake , you were bound to run into someone you knew . You did n't take her home , the way they seem to now , and expect your parents to bring the two of you breakfast in bed . That left the automobile . You remember how it was . " " I was n't prying after details . I only said it mattered to you . " " There 's no reason you should n't know the details . Such as how many times I slept with her altogether . Six or seven ? I was n't much of a tempest in her teapot . " " If this is bothering you I 'll stop . " But of course he could n't let her stop , because he was inventingthis conversation , he needed her questions so that he could answer them . Also , as his invention , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who had modestly distinguished himself , and she knew this episode in his past that she thought intimate and touching . She wanted the Nola episode to demonstrate something about his sensitivity , or constancy , or character . She wanted to believe that a deep distresshad humanized his soul , and also she wanted him to have been Nola 's innocent victim . Even while he estimated her misconceptionswith a good deal of irony , he wanted to keep her there , talking . The sound of a car  --  police car ? someone running from the police ?  --  came fast up South Temple from the direction of the Union Pacific station . He heard the foot come off the throttle as the car swerved around the Brigham Young monument , and then come down hard again . The sound hummed away eastward , diminishing , gone . He said , " If I tell you this sad story will you quit trying to inventit ? Physically it never amounted to much . There just was n't opportunity . We did n't want to be the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was not bothered by his bluntness . She said , " I thought she went to the doctor . " " I do n't think she had herself fitted , if that 's what you mean . " " Why did she go , then ? " " I doubt that she did . "  | " Why did she say she had to ? " " I do n't know . " " What do you think ? " " What do I think ? I think Forsberg had had her virtue , and she did n't dare tell me . I think she cooked up that doctor story so there 'd be an explanation in case I noticed . " " She was lying to you from the beginning . " " That is n't fair . She was in love with me . She had this indiscretionin her past and could n't tell me because she knew I could n't take it . " There was a further question hanging in the dark between them , wherever they sat talking . Did he notice ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that bedroll in the moon-flecked shadows of the cottonwoods beside the gaggle of an irrigation ditch under the Capitol Reef ? Evidently she did n't feel that she should ask . The answer , in case she did , would be yes , he did notice , and no , she was not a virgin . Some doctor had done his job . He turned on his side to woo sleep . His body ached with tiredness , he pressed into the mattress with a ton 's weight . But in a moment this companion  --  interlocutor , old girl friend , lost possibility  --  camesnuggling up , fitting herself to him , warm and comforting and female . It was unfortunate that she took that way of declaring herself , because her presence and her gesture told him something about himself , and moreover brought back that bedroll , that warm night , when after their second lovemakingNola had crowded against him in exactly the same way , her breasts against his back , her breath warm and drowsy , her lips kissing the back of his neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a nice formation . " He noted the terminology . He had noted it then , but chosen not to acknowledge what it suggested . Formation . A military term . " You were going to tell me about it , " Holly said . " There 's nothing really to tell . A piece of banal juvenilia . Summerlove affair . Dates every night . Movies . Once in a while we 'd go dancing at the Old Mill , that open-air place at the mouth of Mill Creek Canyon . Shirt-sleeve summer nights , big moons floatingup over the Wasatch , lots of close-harmony singing . Lots of necking , seldom consummated . Standard erotic obsession . "  | " But you were working . You played tennis . " " Not much tennis . Joe and I entered two tournaments and did n't last three rounds in either one . Joe was disgusted . So was his father . I was so groggy for sleep I was worthless . If I had n't been going to quit soon , I think he 'd have fired me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of taking into the business . " " But you were ambitious . You were going off to law school . When did you tell Nola about that ? " " Late . Very late . August . I made it sound as if the chance had just come up and it was such a great chance I could n't refuse it . " " You were n't very honest with her , either . " " Each of us had something to tell the other that we were afraid the other could n't accept . We were both right . " " But you both had to accept it . " " I do n't know . I never admitted what was actually very clear . She never reconciled herself to my going away . It made a difference . She 'd get black moods . It changed there , toward the end . A sort of desperation came into it . We did some unlikely things . " " She waited , it seemed to him , in some hope that he would be explicit . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately , he had n't obliterated it , and that he regrettedit as much now as he had then . He felt like taking out his pen and scatching over and over it until it was nothing but a rectangleof solid black . " You ca n't want to hear every shabby detail , " he said . " Only if you want to tell me . " " I do n't . " " All right . " But he could n't let her back off so meekly . Apparently he still needed her for antiphonal purposes . " We double-dated one weekend with Jack Bailey and his swamp angel . Bailey had the use of somebody 's cabin at Brighton . We went along and shacked up with them . " " With that . .. ! " " Cunt-hunter , yes . " " Oh , Bruce . " " I know . I was supposed to spread my cloak over mud puddles , not drag her through them . "  | " Why would you take her ? Why would she go ? She despised Bailey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room was as dusty with shadows as his mind . " Desperation ? " he said . " The feeling that every day brought calamity closer ? We were obsessed with one another , we could n't ever seem to be alone or free . So when Bailey came coiling down out of his cinnamon tree and whispered in my ear , I heard him as an opportunity . I had these visions of pines and stars and darkness , another round of Capitol Reef . So did Nola , I suppose . We thought we could ignore Bailey , or put up with him , and his girl as well , even though we both thought she was a disgusting chippie . " " Why would Bailey ask you ? How did he know you were .. . you know , intimate . " " On matters like that Bailey was infallible . He thought when we disappeared from the prom we gave ourselves away . He was wrong about the circumstances but right in general . " " You put yourselves right in his hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It would certainly have been called an orgy in 1930 . " " All together ? " " Good God , you have got a lurid imagination . No . But not quite the Capitol Reef , either . There were two double beds in this one-room shack , with a blanket hung over a wire between them . " " It sounds so vulgar and grubby . " " It was all of that . " And when he came back from school the following June , starved for that girl , strung up like a fiddle string , denying the intimations of petulance and rejection he had been getting from her letters all through the spring , planning the surprise he had to propose  --  that she go with him to Reno , where his family had moved , and spend the summer at their cottage on Lake Tahoe ; when he pulled up at her door after dark , dinnerless and blearyeyedand hallucinating after eighteen hours on the road , expectingthat the evening would be his and that the blackboard could be cleaned of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when she opened her door to him and he found thatp213instead of spending the evening with him she had to sing with Jack Bailey out at the Old Mill , was already in evening dress with her smooth shoulders bare  --  for Bailey  --  and really could n't , now how could she ? Their act was n't over until one  --  see him afterward , she 'd have arranged it otherwise but he had n't said he 'd drive straight through , she had n't expected him until tomorrow  --  why , right then his mind had gone back to that shack in Brighton and arrived at a conclusion like a calculator flashing its instant sum . It went back now , and the sum was the same that had sent him off to Reno , alone , before noon the next day . Zero.  |p215He  can hear them through the door and through the years  --  the laughter , exclamations , screams , rebel yells . Reluctantly he puts his thumb on the latch and steps in on their party . The air is thick with cigarette smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musty odor of the place itself . It is a smell that rises from corners , lies like a gas along the Congoleum floor , sifts down from rafter angles where pack rats have left accumulations . Put your nose to the rough studs and you smell it . It is the smell , among other things , of mice in various forms and stages : living nests of shavings and chewed rags , with a core of pink newborn things as naked as worms ; abandoned nests stained with tiny urination and peppered with tiny turds ; old carcasses , paper-dry , found where the poison left them , or flattenedin traps . Each is a special staleness , together they compose the total odor of a species : birth , copulation , death . Into their pervasive blend , like pigments into a mixing base , are wrapped other shack odors ; dust , oilcloth , kerosene , candle wax , the linseed-oil fabric of the window shades , even a wholesome memory of spruce gum from studs and rafters . In this unbreathable atmosphere , made worse since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing morep216unbreathable with every butt they add to the overflowing saucerson the floor , they are sitting cross-legged around a blanket playing strip poker . They have been playing for some time , for all are partly undressed . All are shoeless . Bailey has both socks , Bruce only one ; the girls are barefoot . Both boys are bare to the waist . Nola still wears her skirt , but has lost her blouse . She managesto look modest in what he thinks he remembers was called a teddy . But Muriel . Well , Muriel has not been holding good cards . She is a large , well-padded girl even in her clothes . Now she sits , a creature out of a Turkish dream , in the puddle of her own flesh , held in from deliquescence only by her arms , crossed over her breasts , and by her straining panties . Leaning against the proscenium arch , the stage manager who has revived and is directing this period piece , he can read her mind . Why not ? She is playing the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her charms and of the interest they arouse , but she would like it a lot better if Nola was n't sitting over there with her back straight and her face expressionless and everythingcovered up . Muriel does n't like Nola , or think she is so good-looking . She is willing to bet that when the time comes to peel , Nola will chicken out . And she is annoyed at the way Bailey , dealing a new hand and singing as he deals , raises his eyes to Nola at every card and puts a burbling emphasis into the words of his song . Though down in her heart I knowwww She 's not slow slowwwAnd ohhh . Those eyes ! What does he have to keep looking at her for ? There 's plenty to look at here , for God 's sake . Like the waters still She 's very deep , She knows a heap I 've found.  |p217She  's got that meet-me-later look And oh , she knows her book That little Quaker downIn Quakertown . Deep my eye . She came up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , trying to be demure ? And where does Jack get off , watching her with that smirk on his face and his mustache twitching like a rat 's whiskers ? Muriel has trouble picking up her cards without exposing herself . She has to lean over and scrape them up with her fingertips , not uncrossing her arms for a second . She sees Bruce 's eye wanderingher way , and shoots him a look like a butcher knife . Let him watch his own girl , if he 's so hot to see something . Something is tickling the side of her breast where it bulges out under her arm . She jerks away with an exclamation from Jack 's stockinged foot . " Keep your old feet to yourself ! " she says , and hugs herself tighter , the cards in her fingertips right in front of her nose . Her skin twitches as if the eyes on her were flies . She reminds Bruce of the kind of postcard for sale in places like Medicine Bow , Wyoming  --  an old cow stepping on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got troubles ! " Next to her Bruce is studying his cards , but his mind is readable , too . He is a chemical machine , and every gland in his body is pumping into his blood the stimulants that the species has evolved to ensure its perpetuation . But if a machine , how complicateda machine ! Assuming that the others are as complicated as he , this powwow across a gray army blanket is as intricate as anything in the universe . Muriel is hard to ignore . If he does n't keep his eyes open , he might miss something spectacular . Also she has a large , loose mouth , and some folklore rumor floating in his head speaks of the sexual apparatus and appetite of women with large mouths . Though he knows this is probably as reliable as the folklore about Chinese women , still he is intensely curious . He wishes he were sitting across from her , rather than next door , so that he could see without appearing to look . Standing by the door , qualmish with distaste , Mason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long before Playboy , skinp218flicks , and the porno revolution made the female body as exciting as a meat market and sex as momentous as blowing your nose . This boy has never seen a naked woman , even Nola ; their lovemaking has taken place in darkness or illusory moonlight , and in a blind fog of adoration . He never had a sister to surprise or spy on . Except for a few French postcards he has probably never seen a completely revealing photograph . And he is only a few years removed from the hilarious hormone-tormented shrimp who was tempted into copping feels in a Saltair crowd . But he has read books . The literary word that bulges in his mind is " pneumatic . " To his eyes , casually slanted in quick glances , Muriel looks as pneumatic as a pile of graduated inner tubes . Like the Michelin ad . When she moves , she afflicts him with all the symptoms of detached retina . That is one element of his complexity , that sexual excitement over a girl he is contemptuous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation if Muriel should drop her arm . He is ashamed of his excitement even while it is as wild in his blood as an eel in a washbas ; n , for on his left , within two feet of him , her knee touching his , sits Nola , also partly undressed and in full jeopardy . If they were alone , he would be worshipping her calm brow and her golden arms and the hair that falls in dark waves down her back . But as it is , his interest in her is postponed or suppressed , almost denied , and is certainly secondary to his interestin the gross provocations of Muriel . In fact , he is glad that Nola is neither as undressed nor as sensual as Muriel . He feels toward her a protective , **28;6485;TOOLONG concern . At first , he was as enthusiastic as Bailey about this game , and he has cooperated with Bailey 's outrageous cheating . The girls are pathetically easy to cheat . Neither knows the least thing about poker ; they do n't even know the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey have dealt off the bottom , drawn extra cards , and picked up cards they wanted from the discard pile . In the interest of mere plausibility it has been necessary to cheat themselves now and then , and lose a shoe or a shirt with roars of dismay . But the closer Muriel comes to the naked truth , the more complexBruce 's response has become  --  all the more eager to get on with it , troubled at what is happening . Much as it arouses him top219think of them sitting under the one hanging bulb as naked as newborn mice , and avid as he is to examine all of Muriel , it makes him stern and gloomy to think of Nola undressing in front of Bailey . Intimations of his own bad judgment and treachery bother his mind . Bailey has been working on Nola , not by being pleasant and trying to charm her , but by a steady , bright-eyed , knowing attention , ironic compliments , baitings , innuendos , dares . He makes her pay attention by exaggerating precisely what she least likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty joke . But he has been very John Gilbert about it : his mustache twitches like an eyebrow . What his effect has been it is hard to say . When he calls her Brown-Eyes , she gives him a smoky glance of contempt . When he sings to her one of his double-meaning snatches of song ( " Mine in May , his in June " ) , she ignores him . But this afternoon , when they rode up to Solitude , and Bailey started racingher on the trail , she would not let herself be passed , and half killed her rented horse beating him to the lake . As she gathers her cards she ignores his Quakertown crooning , and there is a smolder like resentment in the olive skin of the cheek turned toward Bruce , and her eyes are veiled . She looks resentful , yet Bruce is uneasy . Outrageous as Bailey is , he gives off sparks . Things happen around him . He is wild in something like the way of Nola 's brother Buck , whom she adores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has called the tune throughout this excursion . Bailey brought that color into Nola 's cheekbones and that set to her jaw . She came to be private with Bruce , but she has spent her whole time fending off Bailey 's kiddingor ignoring Bailey 's off-color remarks . Now here she is in danger of undressing in front of him  --  and it is she for whom the strip poker was proposed , Bruce is sure . Bailey does n't have to go to all this trouble to get the clothes off Muriel . Muriel twitches like a horse , and Bruce 's eyes shift . Nothing but the extruded side of her water-balloon breast and her instant hostile glance . His own glance is opaque and indifferent as he turns it to Nola . By their rules , any item of clothing equals any other . Right now , she would have to risk her skirt to win one of Bailey 's socks . What else has she got on ? The teddy , a brassiere , perhapsp220underpants . Or does the teddy take care of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have her in trouble . Two , and she will be right where Bailey wants her . Will she strip , if it comes to that ? As it will ? The tip of her tongue is against her upper lip as she arranges her cards . Her eyes meet Bruce 's , and she smiles lightly . She has the exhilarated , heightened look that she sometimes has while singing . " Cards , " Bailey says . He holds the deck in his left hand and with the thumb and forefinger of his right he riffles the edges . They are new cards , and the sound is peremptory . Like a selfconsciousshark , he smiles . " How many , Muriel m'love m'love ? " Without moving her arms from their cross on her breast , Muriel sticks out three fingers , letting three unwanted cards dribble onto her thighs . " Three , " Bailey says . " For your sake , Sister Snow , let us pray they 're good ones . " Deadpan , he inserts the three cards into her extended fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under her hands . She shrieks and bends away . " Get out of there , you ... ! " Bailey withdraws . " Oh boy , " he says with utter unenthusiasm . " Hot dog . " Furiously Muriel stabs him with her eyes . She holds her cards against her collarbone and is dignified . " Brother Mason , " Bailey says . " Give me three , Bishop Bailey , and give them your blessing . " " Three ? Too bad , pal . It pains me to see you brought so low . Here 's some extra-heavy ones . " He whacks the cards down on the blanket so hard that two of them jump face up . Before the others have settled back from their startlement at his violence , Bailey is as inert as the Buddha . Confirming that the cards which fell face up will not help his hand , Bruce refuses them and demands two more . After an argument , Bailey passes him two , which turn out to be four . They do n't help his pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon , " Bailey says . " Sister Gordonis sitting there hiding something . What can Sister Gordon need to make her even happier ? " She gives him a level glance and slides one card onto the blanket.  |p221Bailey  clasps his brow in consternation . " One ? Brown-Eyes , what are you doing to us ? What have you got there ? Two pair ? Possible straight ? Possible flush ? Four of a kind ? Oh , Brother Mason , hang on to your pants ! " Nola picks up the card he conspiratorially deals her , looks at it , and folds it into her hand . " It suits her ! " Bailey cries . " God , Mason , we 're ruined . She 's sitting there with a Farmer Brown and she 's got designs on our most per-sonal and pri-vate garments . " His black widow 's peak moves down and then back , his eyes are bright and full of glee . He looks over at Muriel 's quivering flesh with compassion . " Kiddo , what are you gon na do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be looking up your old address . " Muriel crosses her eyes and sticks out her tongue . Bailey reels , and then stiffens with resolve . " Unless the Great Bailey can catch . " " What difference does it make who I lose to ? " Muriel says . " Anyway , who says I 'm gon na lose ? " " Ah , " Bailey says sadly . " She caught , too , Mason . We 're surrounded . All right , boy , the old spirit . Better death than dishonor . " He consults his hand . " The Great Bailey will take two . " With his eyes closed , he lays his cards down on the blanket without discarding any , and gropes until his hand finds the deck . How many cards he takes is not clear  --  three or four . Keeping these palmed , he picks up the original hand and fuses it with the new one . Immediately he begins to laugh silently , bending his forehead clear to the blanket . His fist holding the cards pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cross-legged squat . A certain number of cards hit the discard pile , but only Bruce sees them . The girls are watching Bailey leap for the twoby-fourabove him . His shadow heaves on the wall as he chins himself furiously  --  three , four , five , six , ten times . Dust shifts down , so that Nola leans away , protecting her hair . Bailey goes on chinning . His biceps bulge , his chest is luxuriant with black hair , spittle comes out of the corner of his mouth , he chortles as he chins . Bruce watches , hating what he sees . Three times during the poker game Bailey has exploded into one of his spasms of energy and challenged him to an arm wrestle . Three times Bruce has waved him off . He tells himself that he can beat Bailey at practi/tally anything , from tennis to pitching pennies , but that truth abides in him sullenly and without satisfaction . As Bailey 's legs go up and down , as his swollen neck is hauled up to the brace for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clammy inferioritycomes on . He could not match Bailey in chinning any more than in arm wrestling . His chest is ribby and hairless , he has little of Bailey 's wadded muscle . The old cold self-knowledge of the runt suggests to him that as a lover he may not match up either . Muriel , he is sure , thinks so , and somewhere in the middle of her self-contained quiet Nola may suspect it , too . Perhaps she feels protective about him , as he feels about her . The thought makes him die a little . And this is another element of his complexity . He no more wants to strip in front of Bailey and Muriel than he wants Nola to . He wants no comparisons . Mason , his survivor , watching from the doorway , shares his inadequacy and self-contempt . They understand , as the strong and beautiful do not , that though clothes may serve important functions of warmth , ornament , and modesty , their principal function is that of disguise . Bailey crashes down , blowing , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Hawthorne Mephistopheles  --  not a face , a visage , gleaming with wicked delight . In his whole life it has never occurred to him to doubt himself for a second , which means that both memory and thought are short-circuited . Yet Bruce feels sullenly that confidence like Bailey 's , however inferiormorally and philosophically to his own self-doubt , is probablyattractive , perhaps irresistible . He wishes passionately that they were somewhere else  --  anywhere else , even in her apartment with her featherbrained roommates around , even parked on Wasatch Boulevard with the cloud of his departure growing darker between them . Anywhere . " And now , Brothers and Sisters , " Bailey says , " everybody should be getting ready to lay down . " He raises a finger . Everythingabout his face is pointed  --  eyebrows , cheekbones , chin , the sporty little mustache , ears , the light reflected in his eyes . Glee grows in his face like flame in kindling . " It is n't fair , " Muriel says with her cards held against her chin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd lose everything . " " You 've already lost everything , baby . " He pats her thigh , but his eyes are on Nola , and he is saying to her silently : You too ,  |p223kid  . Do n't pretend around me . You lost it and liked losing it . " Everybody set ? " A knot has gathered under Bruce 's breastbone . He has to break this up , but how ? Bailey will never let them forget it if they back down . But if they do n't back down , there goes Nola 's skirt or brassiere . Bailey sits there with a straight , a flush , a full house . With all those cards , he has to have something good . For a second he wishes he had cheated as wildly as Bailey , and yet , as Muriel says , what difference would it make ? He ca n't beat Baily without beating Nola , too . The only way she can get out of this is to beat Bailey herself , and she is n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Expose Bailey 's cheating ? He has n't been the only one . Still , that may be the only way . Let it break up in accusations and denials . He lights a cigarette , takes a drag or two , and passes it to Nola . The fog around them is thick and blue . Muriel is still grumbling . " I do n't care ! You get all the good hands . You 'll beat me and say I should take everything off , and I 'm not going to be the first . " Bailey can discern an injustice when one is called to his attention . " Two to one , I 'll bet you . How 's that ? " " Two socks against my pants ! " " Two socks and my pants ? " The look of a sly bargainer comes into her eye . " You 'd still have your shorts , and I would n't have anything . " Bailey , after a moment of thought , smacks his knee . " All right ! I 'm ahead , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mirth convulseshis face and is at once wiped away . " Here 's what we 'll do . This is the last hand . Everybody bets whatever he 's got left . Brother Mason shoots his wad , Brown-Eyes risks her all , Muriel hangs her last rag on the line , the Great Bailey puts everything at hazard . " He says it to all of them but he is talking to Nola . Bruce can see her face settling into stubbornness , resentment , and determination . She thinks she has a chance . But why is he staying ? What does he expect to do with his pair of nines ? Abruptly he throws down his cards . " Not me . I 'm out . " Bailey is scandalized . The honor of the company . The code of the sportsman . " No , " Bruce says , shaking his head . " I fold . "  |p224He  will not look at Nola . He looks at Muriel instead , and Muriel is as scandalized as Bailey . " Well , all right ! If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture of throwing in her hand , too , and Bruce 's hope leaps up . But Bailey has grabbed her wrist . For a moment a pink nipple-eye goggles free and is clapped under again . " Wait , wait , " Bailey says . " You ca n't , Mason . " " Why ca n't I ? Why should I stay with a pair of nines ? " " Because this is the last hand . If you back out now you 're a welsher . " " You 're darn right , " Muriel says . " You get me practically naked and then you quit . I 'm not undressing unless the rest of you do . " " Somebody wo n't , " Bruce reminds her . " Somebody 's going to win this pot . Guess who . He called it the last after he saw he had it cinched . " " Who says he has it cinched ? " Muriel says . " I 'm still playing , if the rest of you are . " " I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , even if I win . Whoever wins has to strip , too . " " Then what 's the use of playing the hand ? " Bruce says . To his dismay , Nola says in her husky whisper , " Come on . Are we playing ? " Bailey is galvanized . " Now you 're talking ! You 're damn right we 're playing . I 'll bet you , by God . Everything against everything . Showdown . Brown-Eyes , I think you 'd like to see me put up or shut up . " " Just once in your life . " Nola says . She gives Bruce an unreadable sidelong look . Anger glows in her temple . She twists to free the ends of her hair from under her , and pulls a sheaf of it forward over each shoulder . Perhaps that is what she is counting on , like Lady Godiva . She has more nerve than Bruce has . He feels desperate and put in the wrong , and it gives him a pang to see her there , proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's see , " he says , and leans against her to look at the cards she spreads slightly to show him . What he expected . Two pairs , kings and sevens . " Mmm ? " He shrugs , carefully noncommittal , hoping that his lack ofp225enthusiasm will warn her . But his mind has seized on a fact : in the hand he just threw away there is a king . " I do n't know , " he says , and picks up his cards again . " Maybe I ought to stay in . " Muriel squawls in outrage . " After you 've looked at her hand ? Oh , no sir , I 'm not going to .. . " Keep your shirt on , " Bruce says , and looks at her and snickers . He throws down the cards , but now the king is in his palm . Again he leans against Nola to look . He takes the cards from her , dropping a kiss onto the point of her shoulder , and studies them and passes them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at least now she has a chance . Leaning back and stretching , he manages to scuff under the blanket the five of clubs he has removed from her hand . " Are you ready , finally ? " Bailey says . " Christ sakes , Mason , she 's already said she 's in . She does n't need your chicken advice . Are you betting us , Brown-Eyes ? " " I 'm betting you . " " Yahoo ! " Bailey says , and lifts his pious eyes . " This may be the greatest unveiling since they took the sheet off Brigham 's statue and found the coconuts . What 've you got you 're so proud of ? " " What have you got ? " " I dealt . Here , we 'll do it in order . Muriel , lay it down . " She lays it down , leaning far forward and endangering herself at several points . " Three eights ? " Bailey shakes his head sadly . " Too bad , kid . Nice try . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wait . First Miss Coverall . " " Two pairs , " Nola says . " Two pairs ? Is that all ? " " I guess it 's enough . " " Mason , Mason , " Bailey says . " Why did n't you instruct this innocentSister better ? Your two pairs do n't even beat Muriel 's three eights . " Nola 's eyes fly to Bruce 's . The color in her temples spreads slowly into her cheeks . " Do n't they ? " For some reason Bruce leaves her exposed . She has put down her cards , face up , but not spread , so that not everything shows clearly . He compresses his lips and shakes his head , trying top226read in her wide eyes what she will do if she loses , as she thinks she has , and may yet . Or what she would do if she won , and Bailey started stripping off there , six feet away . But he ca n't read her . Her eyes tell him no more than an animal 's would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving back and forth like a cobra . " What a pity , what a pity ! Oh , Sister Gordon , if you had only sought the right counsel . Because . . . I 've . . . got . . . here . . . in . . . my hand ... " He lays down the nine of hearts , then the ten , then the jack , then the queen . Their eyes are on the withheld last card . Bailey 's eyes bug out , his mouth opens , he slams the card down with a yell . Deuce of hearts . " A flush , " Bailey says . Sweet , wonderful triumph has replaced the tension in Bruce 's insides . He is in no hurry . He stays leaning back on his hands while Bailey stops his weaving and says , " Now , ladies and gentlemen ! See it here ! See it all ! Spectacular , revealing , first time in the Western Hemisphere ! " Beatifically he smiles . " Losers first . " Nola looks at Bruce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets her mouth and stares with dislike at Bruce and hugs herself tighter . " Not me . Not in front of him . He backed out . He has to leave . " Disgust makes Bruce move more violently than he planned to . He jerks forward onto his knees and with his fingers spreads Muriel 's hand , three honest eights . He spreads Bailey 's dishonest but undeniable heart flush . Then he spreads Nola 's full house , and his eyes find Bailey 's and hold them . He says nothing . Bailey leans and stares . " You stacked them ! " " The hell I did . She just misread her hand . Ha , ha , you old bugger , you walked right into it . Off with the duds , Bailey old boy . Off with the last rag , Muriel . We 'll run it up on a pole as a signal of distress . " But Muriel , sitting angry among her inner tubes , spits out , " I 'm not undressing in front of you ! " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey says . " Horsefeathers , Bailey . You lost . You called me chicken , what are you ? " Promptly Bailey tears off a sock , then the other . " Do n't call me chicken ! "  | " Oh hell , who cares whether you peel or not ? " Bruce says . " Come on , Nola , let 's get some air . " He pulls her to her feet , suddenly shocked at seeing her in her underwear . She grabs up her blouse , then his shirt and sweater , and comes along . Barefooted , they go out into the mountain night , so clean and cold after the shack that he feels his first lungful as a sword swallower must feel the steel . The stars are blue-white and brilliant , the sky is narrowed by the dark spiked tops of firs . On the doorstep they struggle into their shirts . He hands her his sweater and she pulls it over her head . He kisses her as her head emerges . " Wait . " Reaching back inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slams the door shut . Following the path that leads out to the road , they walk behind the yellow puddle of light . " Why did you put that king in my hand ? " she says . " Because he 'd have beaten you if I had n't . " " I thought two pairs was a good hand . I wanted to beat him so bad he 'd crawl . " " You could n't have beaten him . He was cheating . " " How do you know ? " " Because I saw him . " " Why did n't you call him ? " " Because I 'd been helping him . The whole game was crooked . " She says nothing . Hunting smooth ground for their bare feet , he squirts the flashlight ahead . As they come out on the road the big old abandoned Silver Lake Hotel looms in the starlight , and beyond it , like a watermark on the sky , the dim granite of Mount Majestic . A meteor streaks down the sky and leaves a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , guilty , and misunderstood . " Why ? " Nola says tightly . " Were you that anxious to see Muriel ? " " Why would I want to see her ? " he says violently . " That cow . I do n't know why . I ought to have my head examined . Bailey can get you doing things you 'd never do . I wish we had n't come up here . " " So do I. " " Would you have undressed , if he 'd won ? "  | " I suppose I 'd have thought I had to . " " Even though he was cheating . " " I did n't know that . " " No , " he admits , and then , overwhelmed by guilt , " I was the one who knew that ! Oh , I 'm sorry , Nola ! Why did I get us into this ? I hate to take you back in there . " " I know . " They stop at the edge of the clearing to cling and kiss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All around the cirque the mountains stand high and dim . There are only a few lights , and no sounds . It is late . Mason , who has followed them here , feels how love , which was first a wonder and an awakening , has brought them already to a kind of desperation , a kind of pollution , a kind of woe . Innocence would have been their happiest choice . In the dark path he rocks her body against his and feels the hot stir of desire and knows that they have brought death into the world . At last she says , " We 'd better go back . I 'm cold . " " Why do n't we just get in the car and go home ? " " What would they do if we stranded them ? " " Probably just what they 're doing now . " " How would they get back ? " " That 's their problem . " " If we did that to them , they 'd talk to get even . " " They 'll probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack thinks it 's smart to pretend he knows everything you do . He likes to get the goods on people . He wants everybody to be as dirty as he is . But he might not talk except to me . " " Damn Bailey . " " We should have known better . " " I should have , you mean . I know the bugger . I 've known him from away back . " He is shivering , running his hand up and down her back , his nose in the fragrant part in her hair . " Can you imagine us makinglove in there while those two listen ? With nothing but that curtain in between ? " She makes no response for a long time . The response she finally does make has a grudging , argumentative quality : " They 'll be too busy to pay attention to us. "  | " Maybe . " Overwhelmed again , he cries , " Ah , why is n't it like the Capitol Reef ? " " It will be again . " " But we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she goes quiet . It is the wrong thing to have said . For at least a minute he stands there crowding her against him , kissing her , moving his hands on her back and sides , trying to revive the passion that was there only seconds ago . But he seems to have put it out . Finally her husky whisper says , " Let 's go . I 'm cold . " In silence , following the slash of the light , they go back into the woods along the narrow path . Short of the cabin Nola stops . " Give me the flashlight . " He watches the disembodied blob of light float and waver down toward the privy . When it disappears , he relieves himself in the bushes . Under the firs it is very black , with only two or three brittle stars showing through the roof of trees . It is as still as it is dark . All Brighton has gone to bed except the two of them , who most want to . In his thin shirt he is shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks and twigs of the trail . He is glad when the light blooms again down in the blackness , and comes toward him darting left and right until it finds him and holds . When she arrives , he folds her once again into a shivering , miserableembrace . But she does n't respond . In a moment she is leaning back with both palms against his chest . " Bruce . " " What ? " " I hate to tell you . I 've got the curse . " " Oh " Stupidly he stands there . For just an instant he wonders if she is lying , if this is punishment . Then with a bitter , strange , husky little cry she lays her face against his chest . " Oh , damn , damn , damn ! " The father-brother-husband in him has already stepped forward , perhaps too promptly , to replace the lover . He is concernedand practical . " Well , did you . . . ? Are you prepared ? " ( And if you are , says some subliminal prompter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " No , I 'm not due . The altitude must have brought it on . Sometimesit does . "  |p230The  little things one learns about women . " Maybe we should go in . " " No . I can cobble something . " " But . . . in there ? With them around ? It 's all name and no game ! " " If you do n't want to , " she says . " I could take you home and come back tomorrow and get them . " " Oh " she cries huskily . " Ca n't you get it through your head ? I do n't want to leave you ! I do n't want you to leave me ! " Her violence awes him . He stands and has nothing to say . Then her whisper asks , " Could you go in and get my little overnightbag ? " " Sure . " " It 's on the bed . " Concerned with what he may interrupting , he knocks several times . Then he pushes open the door . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashlight beam across the shack to the right-hand bed . The air in the shack is so bad that he turns his mouth inside out . " Gahhhl How do you stand it in here ? " " We were doing fine till you came along , " Bailey 's voice says . " You finally coming to bed ? " " I just came in to get something . " He gets it and turns back . The diffusion of the light , just before he turns it off , shows their noses , side by side . On second thought he revives the light , returns to the bed that he and Nola will share , kneels on its sagging mattress , and heaves the window above the bed wide open till it sticks . " What the hell you doing ? " Bailey says . " Opening up . It smells like a fox farm in here . " " Then when you get through opening up what are you gon na do ? I do n't want to seem inquisitve , Mason , but are you gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't mind me . Go right ahead with whatever you were doing . " " Sure . What are you doing , out in the cold and dark ? " " Looking at stars . " " Oh yeah ? " " Yeah . "  | " Well , for Chrissakes settle down . You could interrupt something important . " " I doubt that . We 'll give you ten minutes and then we 'll be in . " He finds the door , and closes it on their grumbles and murmurs . Nola stands where he left her . She takes the bag and flashlight and says , " Go a little way away . I 'll whistle . " So he gropes along what he thinks is the path , stumbles into bushes , stubs his feet on rocks and roots , and at length stands staring into blackness that writhes with dim shapes as much in the eye of the beholder as beauty is supposed to be . At length her low whistle summons him . " Bailey 's going to give us a bad time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey look after himself and we 'll look after ourselves . " " All right . I 'd better give him a warning , though . " Again he knocks , and again he waits before he pushes the door open . He and Nola do not speak . With a slash of the light he shows her where the bed is , and after a second or two gives her another wink to make sure she has found it . The bed complainswhen she sits down on it , and his heart flinches . They wo n't be able to so much as roll over without those two assuming things . Softly , feeling with distaste the grittiness of the floor under his bare feet , he finds his way across the cabin without the light and sits down beside Nola . She is already undressed , and she comes against him bare and loose when he touches her . From the other bed , a few feet away behind the blanket , Bailey says , " Pardon my curiosity , but it just occurred to me to wonder where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you 're gon na climb into the same bed . " " Shut up , Jack . " Snickers , murmurs . " I never would have believed it , " Bailey says . " Pipe down . " " So much a lady . So resentful of vulgar slurs . " " Shut up , you son of a bitch , or I 'm coming over there with the ax . I 'm not kidding . "  |p232A  moment 's silence . " Why , he 's offended , " Bailey says . " Chivalryis.not dead . " Murmurs . Snickers . Nola lifts her knees and slips into the bed . " Once more , " Bruce says furiously . " I 'm warning you , Bailey . Once more . " He waits . Nothing but rustlings and smothered laughter . He slides his pants down and off and gets in beside his true love . She turns to him and they meet , silently grappling . He feels the barrier she has built against him , and it only makes more excruciating his desire . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey do . There are no murmurs and snickers from this side . He goes into her arms the way gophers used to go into his little Oneida jump traps back in Saskatchewan  --  head first , and were gone . Kissing her , he finds that her face is wet . Her nails dig into his back . The other bed is silent . Some uncounted time later it awakens again to creakings and rustlings that soon steady into rhythmic squeaking . Bruce and Nola lie locked in their hard unrewarding grapple . His arms are dead and his side aches from the unrelenting rigidity of his position . He feels that this balking of desire is somehow his fault . He hopes that Nola is asleep , and so will not stir and risk wakening her . Listening to Bailey and Muriel make their carnal love , he is fascinated , and filled with disgust , and bitterly ashamed . And he is not at all sure that Nola is not listening , too , and somehow blaming him . BAM ! Someone has shot through the shack with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the edge , every hair on end and his heart , after one enormous bound , thudding in his chest . He is aware that Nola is up on her elbow behind him . A paralyzed silencehas overtaken the rhythmic squeaking next door . " Holy Christ ! " says Bailey 's voice out of the dark . " What was that ? " Bruce , glaring around in blackness , groping for the misplaced flashlight , feels how comprehension struggles by slow osmosis from capillary to capillary . Mason , too , up on his elbow in the dim hotel room , struggles toward the same realization , or an equivalent one . Someone down in the street has shot off a gun . The window above them , jammed open without a prop , has let loose and dropped with a bang.  |p233He  eases back down . Bruce says to Bailey , " The window fell shut . " It is all fading , dimming , slowing down . His heart slows from its painful pounding . Off in the dark behind the curtain he hears the rustling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a sound as if he is talking with his face between breasts . His whisper is confidential , amorous , nuzzling . " Jesus , that 's a new one . How 'd you like that , kid ? Coitus alarmus ... " Mason feels for the girl who was lying beside him , but she is gone.  |p237He  awoke at seven with a headache and the feeling that there was something he was supposed to do . It took a moment to think : flowers for the funeral . Not an errand important enough to wake a man up after only four or five hours of disturbed sleep . But he was used to waking with jobs on his mind . Mornings had always been his best time , his day-organizing time . His friends used to be amused at his little black book , in which he jotted down appointments , reminders , obligations , shopping lists , which , as soon as each item was taken care of , he inked out so blackly that they could not be read . He was a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested only in where he was going . Thinking with some irony that they would have had to change their description if they could have been in his head for the last eighteen hours , he got out his book and set up the morning . FlowersSettle with Philips at the Home Funeral : be there ii:goCall Joep238Not much . He wished there were more . Sight of the sweater and box beside his bed suggested to him that if he did n't have things to do , he could again be seduced into messing around in the past like a scavenger in a dump . For a man uninterested in where he had been , the broken newsreel his mind had played through the night was as disconcerting as a failed lie detector test . He got into the shower and washed all that away . He was already in the hall , and closing the door on his way to breakfast , when the telephone rang . Surprised , suspicious , his responsesleveled out to flat caution , he went back and answered it . " Mr. Mason ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Richards ? " He held , wondering what Mr. Richards , and then he came on : Herbert Richards , one of the Assistant Secretaries of State . " Hello , Bruce ? " " Yes . Good morning . What 's up ? " " I 'm sorry to hunt you down on the road , especially since your secretary said you 're on an unhappy errand . " " It 's all right . A mercy , as they say . She was very old . " " Still . No fun . " " No . Were you calling to commiserate with me ? " " All right , Your Excellency . No , as a matter of fact . I 'm calling to see if you 'll help us out for a month or so . " " Help you out how ? " " Covering the OPEC meeting in Caracas . " " Do n't tell me you have n't already got that covered . It comes up in two weeks . " " I know . Sure we 've got it covered . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does n't matter . There are plenty of people to look after the Venezuelans and Ecuadoreans . It 's the Arabs we 're worrying about , and we have n't got an Arabist who comes close to you . How about it ? " " June 14 is pretty close . " " I know , " the earnest electronic voice said . " We were going to go with Henry Knoll . He is n't Bruce Mason , but he knows his way around . But Henry just came up with bleeding ulcers . Hep239does n't need an OPEC meeting . So we had a huddle last night and asked ourselves why not the best ? You worked for Aramco for years , you 've served in both Saudi Arabia and Iran , you know all the Middle Eastern countries , you 're fluent in Arabic , you know Yamani and most of the others , you 're not now officially in the Department , your magazine is influential . You wo n't be exactlyinvisible , but at least you 'll have a front . And they 'll talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and informed constituency . Do n't say no . You 're the only one who can do this . " " I 'd have to be briefed . " " And debriefed . We figure a month altogether . " Mason ran a calendar through his head , estimating . " I drove over here , wanting to see the desert again . That means I have to drive back . I could n't get to California before tomorrow night , even if I left right after the funeral . Today 's what ? Wednesday ? Say this afternoon and tomorrow to drive back , and Friday and Saturday to get the office squared away . The earliest I could fly to Washington would be Sunday , the earliest I could be in the office would be Monday morning . " " Monday morning is great . " " Well , all right , then . Do I come as a consultant , or do I get briefly hired as a Department employee , or what ? " " Can we leave that till you get here ? We want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . " " You 're already cleared as a consultant , anyway . Have you got TR vouchers ? " " I think so , yes . " " Good . Just come on , then . I 'll look for you Monday morning . If you get in early on Sunday , call me at home . Come out and stay with us in Bethesda , if you 'd rather . " " A hotel 's easier on both you and me , " Mason said . " I 'll have my secretary try the Hay Adams . Otherwise the Shoreham . I 'll see you Monday morning . " " Great . I 'm absolutely delighted you 'll do this . " " Did you really have any doubts ? " " No , " Richards said , and laughed . " Bring your black book . " " I 'm making an entry in it right now . " " Marvelous , marvelous . Till Monday , then . "  | " Warta luego . " " Hasta la vista . Goodbye . Thanks , Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This could be fun . " The Middle East pursued him . While he was breakfasting in the coffee shop he read in the Tribune that Adnan Khashoggi , who had been investing Saudi petrodollars in the United States for years , had yesterday opened an International Trade Center out on the flats beyond the Jordan . Mr. Khashoggi was not personallypresent for the ribbon cutting because he had been subpoenaedin the Lockheed bribery affair , and was staying out of the country . Nobody quoted in the Tribune seemed disturbed by this cloud on the Trade Center . In Utah , apparently , a petrodollarwas a dollar . It amused Mason to find Khashoggi active in Utah . He had known Khashoggi 's father years ago , when he was court physicianto Ibn Saud , back in the time when Socal , the forerunner of Aramco , was hauling Saudi Arabia hand over hand into the twentieth century , and when Riyadh was a mud fort with neon quotations from the Koran around its walls . Now here was the son planting a piece of the Saudi-owned twenty-first century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suckers when he was thirteen or fourteen  --  a creek called the Jordan by zealots who compared themselves to the Children of Israel , and took it as a sign and a wonder that their promised land , like that to which Moses led his people , lay at the far edge of a biblical wildernesson the margin of a dead sea . Wilderness no longer . The air outside was city air , the heat was city heat . The night 's coolness was already shriveling upwardalong the faces of buildings , and the crowds hurrying to work sought , as Mason did , the shady side of the street . The flower shop to which the doorman had directed him turned out to be run by a Nisei woman with mainly gold teeth . She was so prompt with suggestions , and so sympathetic to his needs , that within twenty minutes he was writing her out a check , and her son in a denim apron had begun to lay out the order on the table at the rear of the shop . The flowers , they promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his black book and drew a rectangle around " Flowers " and inked in the rectangle until it was solid black.  |p241Now  item two . It had been on his mind as a mildly distasteful duty that he would have to go up and sort out his aunt 's few shabby possessions , give to her friends , if any , what they could use , if anything , and dispose of the rest to the Goodwill or the Relief Society or the trash can . Philips , the director , had forestalledhim by sending down to the funeral parlor his aunt 's watch and wedding ring , along with Nola 's conscientious box of returnables . But there were still his aunt 's last bills , the closing out of the account . He borrowed the Nisei woman 's telephone and made a call . Philips , it turned out , had already taken steps . Mr. Mason had got the personal belongings , the watch and ring and such ? Yes . And the box of his own belongings ? Yes . The rest was so minimalthat he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the Goodwill . Mason hung up feeling vaguely rebuffed , as if Philips had failed in cordiality . But he drew a rectangle around Aunt Margaret'sproblems and inked them out . Now there was only the funeral , nearly three hours away , and the calling of Joe , which he began evading as soon as he thought of it . He felt half irritable , nursing his shadowy headache . He wished he could dispose of these trivial details and get started back to San Francisco . He was already thinking ahead to Washington and Caracas , leaning into the routine preoccupations and challenges of his life . At the same time , he was thinking almost aggrievedly that Aunt Margaretwas a true Mason . She left nothing , not even duties . No will to read , papers to sort , house to clear out and sell , lawyers to see . Where she went down there was not even an oil slick . Unexpectedly given three free hours in any other city , he would have visited a museum or toured the monuments . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monuments . Without much wanting to , he found himself driving around town in that state of mixed recognition and bewildermentthat had possessed him in every unoccupied moment since he arrived . The city was bigger than he liked , and its expanding edges were indifferent to his insistent recollection . The university had grown so much that the old Circle , once the heart of the place , looked lost and apologetic , a survival . His impulse to go in and see if Bill Bennion 's office was still there withered . His sugges/tion to himself , that he find a telephone book and see if he could locate Bill himself , lasted only as long as it took him to recollect that if Bill were alive he would be past eighty , perhaps senile , surely forgetful , with no such memories as Mason had of the times when Bill had taken a can opener to his mind and let in the air of books and ideas . Many bright students had gone through Bennion 's life , each occupying three or four years . He could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazareth ? I do not call him to mind . " He drove on up toward the mountains and found that much of old Fort Douglas had become a golf course . The apricot orchard through which he had unreeled his tardy telephone wire was a fairway bordered by bungalows . The firing range where he had shot the nick out of Colonel Waterman 's hat had vanished under lawn and sand traps . And up on Wasatch Boulevard where he and Nola had used to park , he got totally lost , and was swept into a freeway that took him clear to the mouth of Parley 's Canyonbefore he could turn off . Making his way back through Sugar House , he drove past the J. J. Mulder Nursery and found that someone ( Joe ? ) had faceliftedits sagging vine-covered front and transformed it into a glass-and-redwood palace call the Tree Farm . Was this the place to try to renew contact with Joe ? He hesitated , almost turned in , turned back out again . There would be all the interruptions of customers and phone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired . And anyway , Mason wanted to see no Tree Farm ; he wanted to keep the Mulder Nursery as he remembered it . Coming in on Seventh South along Liberty Park , he drove slowly , looking for the first house they had lived in in Salt Lake , the one with the bullet hole beside the door . He recognized nothing . Down Ninth South to State . Now Automobile Row . Once he had haunted the State Street corner of the old ball park , waiting to chase down one of the balls that got hit over the fence in battingpractice . Turned in at the wicket in the left-field wall , such a ball got you a free bleacher seat . Long gone  --  gone , he realized , well before he had left Salt Lake . Gone , too , naturally , the Night Owl , where at one or two of a Sunday morning after a date he and Joe used to stop for a pork tenderloin and a milk shake.  |p243But  when he turned up West Temple he could tell from the feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed all along . After two blocks he slowed to a crawl . Mid-block , on the west side , there should be a brick apartment house . There on the southeast corner , ground floor , after two months of hard trying , his mother had died in October 1931 . It was n't there . What was there was a two-story , balconied motel , a square U with its opening to the street , cars angled in against the walks , its office showing a lighted neon sign : VACANCY . Like his father 's fleabag hotel , the place of her dying had been swept away and replaced , and in the process her very existence had been made dubious and unverifiable . Nothing here confirmed what he had carefully inked out but not forgotten . Vanished or not , this was what he had been inexorably returning to  --  this misery , this wreck of everything . He had lost his brother , his savings , his safe place in the world , his girl . He had never had a father . He was losing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morphine dehumanized her . Happiness , confidence , security , hope , were delusions . Pain was real , and shame was real . He withdrew into endurance , he avoided old friends , even Joe . He embraced dull sorrow . Now none of that existed . In their Chamber of Commerce zeal for progress they had modernized him out of his profoundest life . " Unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life , " Schopenhauer had once tried to teach him , " our existence must entirely fail of its aim . " Did he believe that ? He did n't know . Or rather , he did know , of course he knew . He did n't believe it for a moment . Nevertheless , he resented being cheated out of what he had finally made his way back to . His father could not bear to go on living in the apartment where she died . Neither could he bear the doldrums and bad times that the Depression by then had brought on . An entrepreneurialfrenzy moved him , he was uptown all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's death , he and Schmeckebier had leased the old pool hall and were working all hours cleaning it up and painting . Expenditures brought on economies , and soon they had given up the apartment and moved into that cheap hotel uptown , sharing a single room . Thep244fall tipped toward winter , the smoky blanket thickened over the city . Bruce walked around in a spiritual coma , unconscious . Behind him a car blasted its angry horn . He took his foot off the brake and turned in against the curb . Turning , he looked into a face contorted with improbable fury . An arm in a loud sport shirt was shaken at him , a voice yelled something : thellryuhdoin ! The car peeled past , roaring . Salaam . Peace . The face , the disproportionate fury , might have been his father 's . Why had n't he left at once ? The Mulders would have taken him in . J.J. might even have found work for him , Depression or no Depression . Or he could have found pickup work at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or he might have gone back to Minneapolis and starved it out there until the new term opened . But he stayed , sleeping in that shabby room where the other bed groaned with his father 's cigar-soaked dreaming weight , and by day hanging around the pool hall . The sun was like a burning glass on his arm , lying along the car door . The pavement writhed with heat waves , and his mind with ambiguous recollections . He tried to remember how he had finally broken away , and could not be sure . Did he make a brutal scene ? Did he throw up to the old man , before they parted , everything he had ever held against him ? Did he say , You made her live half her life without friends , and never even realized , because she was loyal and would n't tell you , what you did to her . Me , too , you shamed me in front of my friends so that I ca n't face them , and ca n't live in this town . Chet , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have got that start he could never recover from . Did he say any of that ? And did he go on and say , Yes , and when she was dying , did you try to help her and make it easier ? Or did you groan around about expenses till she felt she could n't afford to be sick ? You know what you did . You stayed away all day , day after day , hanging around the New Grand Hotel trying to make a quick buck and investing in gold mines that eventually broke you . And two days before she died you all of a sudden had to go to Los Angeles for a load of whiskey  --  nothing could wait . What you were doing was running out . You were leaving her to die alone , or with only me . And youp245already had that henna-haired floosie . Mother told me . She said she could smell her . Hard times ! While your wife died by inches , with only me to help , you were already being consoled by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or only rehearsed them sullenly , wanting to say them ? He had an image of his father 's face convulsed with rage like that driver who had just peeled by , furious at six seconds ' delay . But there was another image , too , the hard face crumpling , going to pieces . Which was more intol-erable ? The feelings of that miserable time came out of the gray past and overwhelmed him.  |p247Still  in waders , with the string of ducks across his shoulder , he stood hesitating on the sidewalk in the cold November wind . His knees were stiff from being cramped up all day in the blind , and his feet were cold . Today , all day , he had been alive ; now he was back ready to be dead again . Lights were on up and down the street , and there was a rush of traffic and a hurrying of people past and around him , yet the town was not his town any more , the people passing were strangers , the sounds of evening carried no warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had shut himself off . Then what was he doing here , in front of this pool hall , loaded down with nine dead ducks ? What had possessed him in the first place to borrow gun and waders from his father , and go hunting ? If he had wanted to breathe freely for a change , why had n't he kept right on going ? What was there here to draw him back ? A hunter had to have a lodge to bring his meat to and people who would be glad of his skill . He had this pool hall and his father , Harry Mason , Prop . He stepped out of a woman 's path and leaned against the door . Downstairs , in addition to his father , he would find oldp248Max Schmeckebier , who ran a cheap blackjack game in the room under the sidewalk . He would find Giuseppe Sciutti , the Sicilian barber , closing his shop or tidying the rack of Artists and Models and The Nudist with which he lured trade . He would probably find Billy Hammond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sandwich and beer and pie , or moving alone around a pool table , abstractedly whistling , practicing shots . If the afternoonblackjack game had broken up , there would be Navy Edwards , dealer and bouncer for Schmeckebier . At this time of eveningthere would be a few counter customers and a cop collecting his tribute of a beer and the other tribute that Schmeckebier paid to keep the cardroom open . And he would find , sour contrast with the bright sky and the wind of the tule marshes , the cavelike room with its back corners in darkness , would smell that smell compounded of steam heat and cue-chalk dust , of sodden butts in cuspidors , of coffee and meat and beer from the counter , of cigarette smoke so unaired that it darkened the walls . From anywhere back of the middle tables there would be the pervasive reek of toilet disinfectant . Behind the counter his father would be presiding , throwing the pool-hall light switch to save a few cents when the place was empty , flipping it on to give an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs past Sciutti 's shop . The hunter moved his shoulder under the weight of the ducks , his mind full for the moment with the image of his father 's face , darkly pale , fallen in on its bones , and the pouched , restless , suspiciouseyes that seemed always looking for someone . Over that image came the face of his mother , dead and six weeks buried . His teeth clicked together . In anger he turned , but the thought of going to the hotel room curdled as it was forming . And he had to eat . Broke as he was , a student kept from his studies , he had no choice but to eat on the old man . Besides , there were the ducks . He felt somehow that the hunt would have been incompleteunless he brought his game back for his father to see . His knees unwilling in the stiff waders , he went down the steps , descending into the light shining through Joe Sciutti 's door , and into the momentary layer of clean bay-rum smell , talcumsmell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barberpole in the angle of the stairs  |p249Joe  Sciutti was sweeping wads of hair from his tiled floor , and hunched over the counter beyond , their backs to the door , were Schmeckebier , Navy Edwards , Billy Hammond , and an unknown customer . His father was behind the counter , mopping alertly with a rag . The poolroom lights were up bright , but when he saw who was coming he flipped the switch and dropped the big room back into dusk . As the hunter came to the end of the counter their heads turned . " Well I 'm a son of a bee , " Navy Edwards said , and scrambled off his stool . Next to him Billy Hammond half stood up , so that his pale yellow hair took a halo from the backbar lights . " Say ! " Max Schmeckebier said . " Say , dot 's goot , dot 's pooty goot , Bwuce ! " But Bruce was watching his father so intently that he hardly heard them . He slid the string of ducks off his shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed solidly  --  offering or tribute or ransom or whatever they were . For a momentit was as if this little act were private between the two of them . He felt queerly moved , his stomach tightened in suspense or triumph . Then the old man 's pouchy eyes slipped from his and the old man came quickly forward along the counter and laid hands on the ducks . He handled them as if he were petting kittens , his big white hands stringing the heads one by one from the wire . " Two spoonbill , " he said , more to himself than to the others crowding around . " Shovelducks . Do n't seem to see many of those any more . And two , no three , hen mallards and one drake . Those make good eating . " Schmeckebier jutted his enormous lower lip . Knowing him for a stingy , crooked , suspicious little man , Bruce almost laughed at the air he could put on , the air of a man of probity about to make an honest judgment in a dispute between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said thickly . " A liddle budderball , dot is vot eats goot . " An arm fell across Bruce 's shoulders , and he turned his head to see the hand with red hairs rising from its pores , the wristband of a gray silk shirt with four pearl buttons . Navy Edwards ' red face was close to his . " Come clean , now , " Navy said . " You shot ' em all sittin ' , did n't you ? "  | " I just waited till they stuck their heads out of their holes and let them have it , " Bruce said . Navy walloped him on the back and convulsed himself laughing . Then his face grew serious and he bore down on Bruce 's shoulder . " By God , you could 've fooled me . If I 'd been makin ' book on what you 'd bring in I 'd 've lost my shirt . " " Such a pretty shirt , too , " Billy Hammond said . Across the counter Harry Mason cradled a little drab duck in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung far down , but its body was neat and plump and its feet were waxy . Watching the sallow face of his father , Bruce thought it looked oddly soft . " Ai n't that a beauty , though ? " the old man said . " There ai n't a prettier duck made than a blue-wing teal . You can have all your wood ducks and redheads , all the flashy ones . " He spread a wing until the hidden band of bright blue showed . " Pretty ? " he said , and shook his head and laughed suddenly as if he had not expected to . When he laid the duck with the others his eyes were bright with sentimental moisture . So now , Bruce thought , you 're right in your element . You always did want to be back with the boys in the poolroom , pouringout to see the elk on somebody 's running board , or leaning on the bar with a schooner of beer talking baseball or announcingthe weight of the big German brown somebody brought in in a cake of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but we 've got some nice ducks , a fine display along five feet of counter . And who brought them in ? The student , the alien son . It must gravel you . He drew himself a near beer . Several other men had come in and he saw three more stooping to look in the door beyond Sciutti 's . Two tables had started up ; his father was hustling , filling orders . After a few minutes Schmeckebier and Navy went into the cardroom with three men . The poolroom lights were up bright , there was an ivory click of balls , a rumble of talk . The smoke-filled air was full of movement . Still more people arrived , kids in high school athletic sweaters and bums from the fringes of skid road . They all stopped to look at the ducks , and Bruce saw glances at his waders , heard questions and answers . Harry 's boy . Some men spoke to him , deriving importance from the contact . A fellowship was promoted by thep251ducks strung out along the counter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way they spoke to him that when the players at the first table thumped with their cues , he got off his stool to rack them up and collect their nickels . It occurred to him that he ought to go to the room and get into a bath , but he did n't want to leave yet . Instead he came back to the counter and slid the nickels toward his father and drew himself another near beer . " Pretty good night tonight , " he said . The old man nodded and slapped his rag on the counter , his eyes already past Bruce and fixed on two youths coming in . Billy Hammond wandered by and stopped by Bruce for a moment . " Well , time for my nightly wrestle with temptation . " " I was just going to challenge you to a game of call shot . " " Maybe tomorrow , " Billy said , and let himself carefully out as if afraid a noise might disturb someone  --  a mild , gentle , goldenhairedboy who looked as if he ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to grown-ups instead of clerking in a girlie hotel . He was the only one of the poolroom crowd that Bruce half liked . He thought he understood Billy Hammond , a little . He turned back to the counter to hear his father saying to Schmeckebier , " I do n't see how we could , on this rig . That 's the hell of it , we need a regular oven . " " In my room in back , " Schmeckebier said . " Dot old electric range . " " Does it work ? " " Sure . Vy not . I t'ink so . " " By God , " Harry Mason said . " Nine ducks , that ought to give us a real old-fashioned feed . " He mopped the counter , refilled a coffee cup , came back to the end and pinched the breast of a duck , pulled out a wing and looked at the band of blue hidden among the drab feathers . " Just like old times , for a change , " he said , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anythingfrom a challenge to an apology . Bruce had no inclination to ease the strain between them . He did not forgive his father the cowardly flight to Los Angeles only hours before his mother died . He did not discount the possibility that his father 's profession might have had the effect of making Nola reconsider whom she wanted to marry . He neither forgot nor forgave the henna-haired woman who several times hadp252come to the pool hall late at night and waited on a bar stool while the old man closed up . Yet when his father remarked that the ducks ought to be drawn and plucked , he got to his feet . " I could do ten while you were doing one , " his father said . Heat spread into Bruce 's face . Carefully not looking at his father , he sat down again . " All right . You do them and I 'll take over the counter . " So here he was , in the pool hall he had passionately sworn he would never do a minute 's work in , dispensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clumping behind the counter in the waders which all day had been the sign of his temporary freedom . Leaning back between orders , watching the Saturday-night activity of the place , he half understood why he had gone hunting , and why it had seemed essential that he bring his trophies back here . That somewhat disconcerted understanding was still troubling him when his father came back . The old man had put on a clean apron and brushed his hair . His pouched eyes , brighter and less houndlike than usual , darted along the bar , counting , and across the bright tables , counting again . His eyes met Bruce 's , and both smiled . Both , Bruce thought , were a little astonished . Later , propped in bed in the room , he put down the magazine he had been reading and stared at the drawn blinds , the sleazy drapes , and asked himself again why he was here . The excuse he used to himself , that he was only waiting for the beginning of the new term before returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stayed because he either could n't get away or would n't . He despised the pool hall , hated his father , was contemptuousof the people he lived among . He made no move to be friendly with them , or had n't until tonight , and yet he darted around corners to avoid meeting people he really did care about , people who had been his friends for years . Why ? He could not hold his mind to it . Within a minute he found himself reading again , diving deep , and when he made himself quit that , forced himself to look steadily at his father 's bed , his father 's shoes on the floor , his father 's soiled shirts hanging in the open closet , he told himself that all the home he had any more was this shabby room . He could n't pretend that by staying he was holding together the fragments of home and family . Hep253could n't fool himself that he had any function in his father 's life , or his father in his . He ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his self-respect until February . But the very thought of the effort it would take made him sleepy , and he knew what that was , too . Sleep was another evasion , like the torpor and monotony of his life . But he let drowsinessdrift over him . Drowsily he pictured his father behind the counter tonight , vigorous and jovial , Mine Host , and he saw that the usual fretful petulance was not in his face . He pulled off the light and dropped the magazine on the floor . Then he heard the rain , the swish and hiss of traffic in the wet street . He felt sad and alone , and he despised the coldness of his isolation . Nola crept into his mind and he drove her out as he would drive marauding chickens from a vegetable garden . Even brooding about his father was better than that . He thought of the failing body that only months ago had seemed tireless and bull-strong , of the face before it had sagged and grown dewlaps of flesh on the square jaws . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes that never paid off , the jobs that never worked out , the hopeful starts that had always ended in excuses or flight . He thought of the eyes that had once filled him with fear , but that now could never quite meet , never quite hold , the eyes of his cold son . Thinking of all this , and remembering when they were a familyand when his mother was alive to hold them together , he felt pity , and he cried . His father 's entrance awakened him . He heard the fumbling at the door , the creak , the quiet click , the footsteps that slid and groped in darkness , the body that bumped into something and halted , getting its bearings . He heard the deep sighing of the other bed as his father sat down on it , his father 's sighing breath as he bent to untie his shoes . Feigning sleep , he lay unmoving , breathing deeply and steadily , but an anguish of fury had leaped up in him , for he smelled the smells his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liquor , and above all , more penetratingthan any , spreading through the room and polluting everythingthere , the echo of cheap musky perfume . The control Bruce imposed on his body was an ecstasy . He raged at himself for the weak sympathy to which he had yieldedp254earlier . One good night , he said to himself now , glaring upward . One lively Saturday night at the joint and he ca n't contain himself , he has to go top off the evening with his lady friend . How ? A drink in some illegal after-hours bar in Plum Alley ? A drink in her room ? Maybe just a trip to bed , blunt and immediate ? His jaws ached from the tight clamping of his teeth , but his orderlybreathing went in and out , in and out , while the old man sighed into bed and creaked a little and lay still . The taint of perfume was even stronger . That was what his mother meant , that she could smell her . The sow must slop it on by the cupful . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old sweetie tonight ? It 's been too long since you came to see your baby . I should be real mad at you . The cheek against the lapel , the unreal hair against the collar , one foot coyly lifted , the perfume like poison gas tainting the clothes it touched . The picture of his mother 's bureau drawers stood in his mind , the careless simple collection of handkerchiefs and gloves and lace collars and cuffs neat among dusty blue sachet packets that gave off a faint fragrance . They were all the scent she had ever used . My God , he said , how can he stand himself ? After a while his father began to breathe heavily , then to snore . In the little prison of the room his breathing was obscene  --  loose and bubbling , undisciplined , animal . After quite a time he woke himself with a snort , murmured , and rolled over . With an effort Bruce relaxed his hands , arms , shoulders , head , feet . He let himself sink . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back again and once more the snoring burst out and died and whi .. ed and sawed and snorted . By now , he had resolution in him , or around him , rigid as iron . Tomorrow , for sure , for good , he would break out of this catalepsy . He would go and see Joe . Joe would lend him enough to get him to Minneapolis . Not another day in this hateful city . Not another night in this room . He yawned , surprising himself . It must be late , two o'clock at least . He ought to get to sleep . But he lay uneasily , his mind tainted with hatred as the air was tainted with perfume . He tried cunningly to elude his mind and go to sleep before it could notice , but no matter how he composed himself for blackness and shut his eyes and breathed regularly , that awareness inside wasp255out again in a half minute , lively as a weasel , and he was helplesslyhunted again from hiding place to hiding place . Eventually he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big dark room in his mind , a room shadowy with half-seen tables . He groped and found a string above him and pulled , and light fell suddenly in a bright cone from the darker cone of the shade . Below the light lay an expanse of dark green cloth , and this was the only lighted thing in all that darkness . Carefully he gathered bright balls into a wooden triangle , pushing them forward until the apex lay over a round spot on the cloth . Quietly and thoroughly he chalked a cue ; the inlaid handle and smooth taper of the shaft were very real to his eyes and hands . He lined up the cue ball , aimed , drew the cue back and forth over the bridge of his left hand . He saw the balls run from the spinning shock of the break , and carom , and come to rest , and he hunted up the yellow One ball and got a shot at it between two others . He had to cut it very fine , but he saw the shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side pocket . He saw the cue ball rebound and kiss and stop , and he shot the Two in a straight shot for the left corner pocket , putting drawers on the cue ball to get shape for the Three . Yellow and blue and red , spotted and striped , he shot pool balls into pockets as deep and black and silent as the cellars of his consciousness . He was not now quarry that his mind chased , but an actor , a doer , a wilier , a man in command . By an act of will or of flight he focused his whole awareness on the game he played . His mind undertook it with intense concentration . He took pride in little two-cushion banks , little triumphs of accuracy , small successes of foresight . When he had finished one game and the green cloth was bare , he dug the balls from the bin under the end of the table and racked them up and began another . Eventually , he knew , nothing would remain in his mind but the clean green cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometime in the middle of an intricately planned combination shot he would pale off into sleep . At noon , after the rain , the sun seemed very bright . It poured down from a clearing sky , glittered on wet roofs , gleamed
