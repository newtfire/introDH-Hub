THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WITH the arrival of the Reagan Administration in Washington , a new social class has appeared on the political scene . It is the class of the " truly needy . " As recently as a few months ago , the truly needy were overlooked by almost everyone , but now politicians and journalists alike speak of them with an easy familiarity , and have even calculated their needs down to the last thousandth of a billion federal dollars . Not to be confused with their predecessors , the needy pure and simple  --  a much larger and more demanding group  --  the truly needy happily require no more federal assistance than turns out to be available to them after President Reagan 's " supply side " economists have taken from the budget what they think they need in order to boost investment . For example , the needy were going to need twelve billion seven hundred and twenty-two million dollars for food stamps in fiscal year 1982 ( by President Carter 's calculations ) , whereas the truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-one million ( by President Reagan 's ) , for a saving of two billion seventy-one million . The Reagan Administration has discovered , among other supposedly excessive benefits in the program , that some children whose families receive food stamps are at the same time getting free lunches at school from the federal government . The needy needed that lunch , but the truly needy apparently do not ; under the Reagan Administration 's budget proposals to Congress , if children are found " double-dipping " ? that is , loading up on free lunch at school and eating off food stamps at home  --  the family 's food stamps will be reduced The Administration thus plans not only to thin down the ranks of the needy to the truly needy but to reduce the benefits to the truly needy as well . At least one official of the food-stamp program is worried that the federal government may not be able to catch the children in the act of eating their free lunch , and thus will not know when to reduce the family 's food stamps ? " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sick and missed a meal , " he said  --  but most of the Reagan people apparently feel confident that the necessary policing can be handled adequately . The Administration proposes , in addition , to cut back the lunch program itself , by making fewer children eligible . Not long ago , cuts of this nature would have aroused considerable protest among the political supporters of the needy , but now that the truly needy have taken their place the supporters are quiet . This one phrase , it seems , has put them all to rout . Just recently , the columnist George Will brought to light another new class in our society  --  one that is a perfect counterpart to the truly needy . He has discovered the people who are " in a sense rich . " The in-a-sense-rich are rich only in a sense because they have spent their money  --  on a house or a college education , say  --  and so are only " statistically rich . " Will rises to a spirited defense of the statistically rich . He fears that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal tax code keeps them from getting rich enough , and asks rhetorically , " What is ' unearned ' about income from money skillfully put at risk in investments ? " He believes that our economy depends on the " endless inculcation of envy , " and worries that if the rich were no longer there to inspire envy the economy would " slow dangerously . " Noting that Christ said , " The poor always ye have with you , " he goes on to make the addition ( somehow overlooked by Christ ) " We had better always have the rich . " In an era of supply-side economics , Will seems to have hit upon a supply-side morality to go with it . According to this new , evenhanded reading of Scripture , society would balance its compassion for the poor with solicitude for the rich . In that arrangement , even the truly needy might be hard put to it to hold their own . ? ? T owns BESIDES the sixty-one cities and five hundred and fifty-eight villages in New York State , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small towns . Some have populations in the thousands , and others in the hundreds  --  and a few , like Hempstead , are bigger than many of the cities . Their total population is around eight million , or a million more than that of New York City , and many of them have names that folks in the Big Apple seldom have occasion to hear  --  names like Aurora , Ballston , Big Flats , Canton , Colonie , DeWitt , Dickinson , Fabius , Guilderland , Irondequoit , Kinderhook , Kirkwood , North Elba , Perinton , Pomfret , Schodack , Tonawanda , Tuxedo , Vestal , and Wappinger . Nine hundred and fourteen of the towns are members of the Association of Towns of the State of New York , and they get a chance to hear from and about one another once a year , when the Association brings their elected and appointed officials to Manhattan for their annual meeting  --  this city being about the only one in the state that is big enough , well enough furnished , and lively enough to hold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latest gathering , a three-day affair , was held last month at the Hilton  --  a favorite rendezvous of the Association of Towns  --  and , as we had done some years back , we looked in briefly on the proceedings . Business at the Hilton is hardly ever better than it is when the small-town officials pour in for their annual get-together . This year , between four and five thousand of them were in residence there  --  town supervisors , councilmen , town clerks , court clerks , town justices , constables , archivists and historians , accountants and assessors , zoning officials , highway superintendents , attorneys , comptrollers , receivers of taxes , and several other kinds of administrators . The purpose of the gathering was not pleasure  --  difficult as it might be for some of the visitors to keep their minds off New York City 's many opportunities for entertainment but business . The officials were here chiefly to improve themselves as public servants to hear what was ailing lo-calities similar to their own , and to pick up pointers from federal and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the small-towners also took over almost all the Hilton 's conference facilities  --  meeting rooms , banquet rooms , ballrooms  --  for lectures , seminars , and workshops on a wide range of matters pertaining to local administration . When we visited their convention some years ago , the agenda featured such topics as Snowmobiles , Suggestions on Conducting Meetings and Hearings , Collector 's Cash Book , Meeting the Public , Sand and Gravel Mining , Roadside Vegetation , and Planning a Town 's Growth . This year , there were discussions about Safe Drinking Water , Mosquito and Black Fly Control , Plea Bargaining , Small Claims Court Procedures , Open-Space Preservation , Arson Training for Police , Town Zoning Laws , Solid-Wastes Management , Transportation Planning , Good Labor Practices , Issuing Marriage Licenses , Enforcing the New Dog Law , Hunting and Fishing Licenses , and Reading the Landscape . After listening in on a couple of the discussions , we got to talking with a man who said that his name was Geoff Davis , and that he was a resident of Colonie . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we asked him what he saw as some of the major problems facing small towns today . " Right now , water shortage is one of the worst of their problems , " he said , " although I would n't say that it affects all towns . For instance , in Colonie we draw most of our water from the Mohawk River . These days , small towns are also very much worried about cutbacks in state and federal programs . Senior citizens make up about ten per cent of the population in small towns , so we are particularly worried about how these cutbacks will affect people on fixed incomes  --  those on Social Security most of all . I would add that the towns desperately need more money from the state for the building and maintenance of roadways . This is an area in which state aid is most inadequate . " Next , we turned to William Sanford , also from Colonie , whom Mr. Davis had beckoned to join us . Mr. Sanford , who is a lawyer and the executive secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sombre-faced . White hair  --  even though he wears it in a crewcut  --  and a black suit added considerably to his solemn mien . Mr. Santrd remained serious when we asked him whether the delegates were having a good time during their three days here . " I surely hope they are n't , " lie said . " The main objective of our meeting is to train and educate town officials to do their jobs properly , to make town government a success . Anybody who is out having a good time is shortchanging the community he represents . I made that perfectly clear at the beginning of our meeting . " Mr. Sanford thereupon reached into a pocket , pulled out a transcript of his opening speech , and drew our attention to the last paragraph . It read : " I again remind you that you are here in New York at this 1981 annual meeting at your taxpayers ' expense . Try earnestly to see that they get their money 's worth through your total attendance at all group sessions . " He said we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aping Max Roach WE spent most of a recent Tuesday evening hanging out with Bill Goldberg , a jazz disc jockey on WKCR , which is the non-commercial radio station of Columbia University . Bill Goldberg , who in his spare time is a history and philosophy major ( he is a senior ) and a research assistant for an accounting professor , has for the last ten weeks been putting together for the station a non-stop , eight-day , twenty-f our- hour-a-day , two-hundred-hour tribute to the great drummer Max Roach . It will begin at 4 p.m. on March 9th and end at midnight on March 17th . We were at WKCR waiting for Max Roach himself to come by to tape an interview for the festival . Bill Goldberg , who is from Augusta , Georgia , has tousled dark curly hair , and he was wearing a red corduroy shirt over a yellow T-shirt , bluejeans , and black-and-orange running shoes laced with bright-orange laces . He looked like a college student . WKCR consists of several small rooms  --  a master control room and ' four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The linoleum floors had coffee stains ; vinyl chairs were torn and wobbly ; Formica tables were chipped ; lockers had stickers affixed to them and wisecracks written on them ; and there were cigarette butts , candy wrappers , a flattened orange-juice carton , and other bits of trash scattered here and there . It looked like college . " We 've got about nine thousand jazz albums and maybe an equal number of tapes , " Bill Goldberg said as he unlocked a succession of doors , revealing closets jam-packed with shelves of record albums and boxes of reel-to-reel tapes . " That 's the Miles Davis Festival  --  one hundred and twenty-six hours , " he said , pointing to tape boxes that lined one three-foot-long shelf . " And that " ? he was pointing his sneakered toe along the bottom shelf ? " is the Louis Armstrong Festival  --  two hundred and fifty hours . Max Roach will be our fortieth festival . It 's been a lot smoother going than the other festivals I 've worked on . I 've been taping virtually all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date with " I 'm not responsible for what you may or may not have seen on ' Laze Boat , ' Ma'am . " Coleman Hawkins , in early 1944 ; I 've been interviewing friends and musicians he 's worked with , editing the tapes , and organizing the chronological discography ; and I 'm about to program the discography into a computer . One reason it 's been easier is that Max is so terrific . We 've done several interviews with him in the past , and he 's always been articulate and expansive . He 's a pleasure to interview . When I was in charge of the Miles Davis Festival , a year and a half ago , Miles was supposed to come up for an interview , but he never showed . He called us at least eight times during the festival . During one of his calls , I said to him , ' Hey , Miles , could n't we just put you on the air , or at least tape our conversation ? ' And he said , jokingly of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll come over and strangle you . ' , , Max Roach arrived . He was dressed in a fashionable tan trenchcoat with a wool liner ; a black corduroy hat ; a rust-and-black plaid sports coat ; beige slacks ; a checked shirt with a white collar ; a magenta tie ; and sienna-colored city-slicker boots . He was carrying a paper bag of chocolate-covered malted-milk balls , and he offered them around . He looked extremely fit  --  at least ten years younger than his age . ( He 's in his mid-fifties . ) Bill Goldberg and a fellow-d.j. , Eddie Karp , led Max Roach into Studio 3 , where they would tape the interview . They all sat down at a large round table , where three microphones had been set up , and began . Not many questions had to be asked ; Max Roach was expansive . He talked about his childhood : " My family moved to Brooklyn from North Carolina when I was about four . I got my first musical experience in church , singing in the children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum-and-bugle corps . Like many Depression families , we got evicted about once a month . Once , we moved into a fourth-floor walkup in which the previous tenants had left a player piano behind . I guess they could n't afford the ten or fifteen dollars to have it moved . Well , it had all these Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller rolls , and my brother and I would put our fingers over the notes and learn the melodies . There was a lot of music in the community  --  the church , of course ; family bands ; and W.P.A.-subsidized music lessons for twenty-five cents an hour . I got my first trap set when was twelve or thirteen , for a Christmas present . All the kids would buy Jimmie Lunceford and Count Basie arrangements for fifty or seventy-five cents . We 'd study the scores , learn a little about how to write . And for a nickel I could travel from my neighborhood , Bedford-Stuyvesant , to Harlem , and listen to all this wonderful music pouring out of the clubs and the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz world : " When I was older and started working , my mother would make all the musicians feel welcome . My home was like a meeting place . The house was always full of musicians , guys sleeping on the floor . Charlie Parker had a favorite chair . When George Russell got sick and I replaced him as Benny Carter 's drummer , he went to convalesce at my house , which is , by the way , where he started formulating his Lydian chromatic theory . " About becoming a bandleader : " I never considered myself a hebopper . I was a sideman for Dizzy and Bird . I was much too shy to ever have Dizzy or Bird play my ideas . Getting my own band together was a way to get my own thoughts and ideas out front . I really felt the need to compose when I first started playing with those giants Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins . After a particularly good night working with them , I 'd act like a cocky young kid and say , ' Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and Prez would say something hack like ' You ca n't join the throng till you write your own song , ' or Hawk would say , ' Do n't lose your head . Your brains are in it.1 31 About assembling the Clifford Brown-Max Roach quintet , in California in the early fifties : " I was doing the film ' Carmen Jones ' during the day , but at night and on weekends Brownie , Harold Land , George Morrow , Richie Powell , and I would rehearse in Eric Dolphy 's parents ' garage . Once in a while , Eric would come and jam with us , and his mother would fix munchies for us . " In the course of two hours , Max Roach talked about African music , about how he plays not in melodic lines but in patterns and designs instead , and about how jazz is a democratic art form  --  because of its improvisational leeways  --  and how neglected and denied it is in this country . He talked about his future plans , which include a multimedia concert at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally , Max Roach popped a malted-milk ball in his mouth and said , " I 'm excited and very optimistic , as always . We have to fight for our turf , and keep on fighting for it . " The Gorilla THOSE weekend drivers along West Street badly covet the gorilla , and yet they deny themselves . George Ellis , the gorilla 's steward , sincerely believes that he has done what he can to find the gorilla a decent home . Meanwhile , however , the gorilla languishes on West Street . Several years ago , George Ellis and some business partners had the distribution rights for a soft drink called Afro-Kola , a venture that ultimately yielded sixty thousand leaking cases of soda and some heartache . George Ellis then took a vow to reduce the level of stress in his life . A gorilla seemed to be part of the answer . Before noon most weekdays and every weekend , George Ellis drives a yellow school bus he owns to one of two spots 011 West Street  --  either downtown , near Pier 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth , near the construction site of the New York Exposition and Convention Center . He parks , unloads a huge stuffed toy gorilla , and spends the rest of the day entertaining hollow offers to buy . " If it 's not bought today , O.K. , I 'm not in a hurry , " George Ellis said one recent Sunday as he watched the traffic move past his uptown site . " Most peddlers , if they had the chance , would save up money so they could open a store . They want to get off the streets . I have no desire to leave the streets . A retail store means overhead , tension . Out here , a good business day is a relaxed day . You do n't need to sell a gorilla to have a good business day . " In addition to the gorilla , George Ellis sets out two rows of cardboard cartons on the sidewalk and lays plywood sheets across them to create shelves . Then he liberates the other animals from his bus . Larger-than-life St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , along with not quite life-size ponies and Bavarian bears . Smaller creatures  --  puppies , rabbits , Teddy bears , lambs  --  sit atop the front row of cartons . Giant frogs and pandas lean against these cartons . THE NEW YORKER . Predators  --  panthers , tigers , lions , leopards , grizzlies  --  congregate in one spot , accompanied by elephants , camels , giraffes , and kangaroos . The gorilla brings the entire menagerie into focus . You ca n't miss the gorilla . If the gorilla stood up instead of tilting and balancing on its fists , it would be six feet tall  --  as tall as George Ellis . The gorilla has gray fur , a red nose , and pinkand-blue eyes . People in a rush to get to a traffic jam miles away , on the Cross Bronx Expressway , invariably rubberneck for the gorilla on West Street . Approximately one in three hundred drivers pulls over . Half the time , the drivers who stop just roll down the window ; the rest of the time , they park and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much for the gorilla ? " When George Ellis tells them  --  it 's not an unreasonable price ; actually , it 's a fraction of what a live gorilla would cost  --  they change the subject . They say , " Oh , well , how much for the camel with the gold necklace ? " or " How much for the bear with the lederhosen ? " A young man in a blue Buick may hear the gorilla 's price and ask , " How much for a poor boy ? " He may-end up buying a panda or a frog or a rabbit or a lamb or , quite likely , nothing . The gorilla would look dramatic riding off in somebody 's blue Buick , but this never happens . George Ellis believes that " most people tend more toward hamburger than toward steak . " Some time ago , George Ellis went to see a designer in Brooklyn and described how a custom-built gorilla should look . The resulting gorilla has George Ellis 's mouth  --  it looks skeptical , amused , and relaxed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is black and hefty . In addition to distributing Afro-Kola , he has studied filmmaking at New York University , worked as a sanitation man in Phoenix ( where he picked up Barry Goldwater 's garbage twice a week ) , delivered cakes in Boston , and traded rice by the carload and cement by the megaton . He enjoys peddling on West Street , he says , " because people come by here and they never stop laughing . They might buy without saying anything at all . They just laugh . They have different rea sons . A guy might buy a grizzly bear because he wants to get hack in the house . " On Sunday , a not very brisk business day , a red Toyota with Jersey license plates stopped at George Ellis 's place of business . The driver , a middle-aged man , stayed in the car while his wife got out and dickered . " How much for the gorilla ? " she asked George Ellis , and he told her . The woman , who was stocky and had short gray hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red vinyl purse . Upon hearing the gorilla 's price , she asked , " How about something for twenty dollars ? " " How about something for fifteen ? " George Ellis said . He held up a twofoot-high beige pony . " Nice pony . You ca n't leave a pony like this out on the sidewalk . " With a lit cigarette in her hand , the woman waved the pony away . She had become interested in the pandas and was studying one that was red and white and one that was yellow and copper . " Which color holds up better ? " she asked . " I do n't know  --  either one , " George Ellis said . " You buying this for a boy or a girl ? " " It 's for me . " " Oh . A girl . " The woman examined the red-andwhite panda closely . " This panda 's dirty , " she complained . " That 's not dirt , " George Ellis said . " That 's just pure New York City dust . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit more deliberating , the woman bought the red-and-white panda and four little Teddy bears . Then she contemplated a gray lamb . " How much ? " she asked . " Three dollars . " " Give it to me for two . " " No . " " Two-fifty ? " " Is it your birthday ? " " Yeah , it 's my birthday . " She smoked her cigarette . " No , it 's not my birthday . But my anniversary comes up next week . " " Give me two dollars and have a happy anniversary . " This victory made the woman feel bold . She reached into her purse to get two dollars From her wallet and , without looking up , said , " Now let 's hear you come down some on the gorilla . " " You 've got expensive taste , " George Ellis told her . " All you need is money . " He packed the lamb and the Teddy bears into a large plastic bag , along with the panda , and put it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front seat and nodded a thank you , and then she and her husband rejoined the traffic , heading uptown on West Street , toward the Lincoln Tunnel and New Jersey , in their red Toyota , gorillaless.
