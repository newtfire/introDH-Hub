From birth to death , every normal person carries in his bowels billions of rod-shaped micro-organisms which the doctors call coliform bacteria . Usually these little " bugs " do no harm ; in fact , their presence is considered normal . But every now &; then , infants dying of epidemic diarrhea are found to harbor coliform bacteria which seem to be abnormal . Last week , every baby born in Port Huron Hospital , Mich. , and every patient admitted , was being tested for a suspected killer of this type which had been isolated there , for the first time in the U.S. <P> Port Huron 's experience seemed just like that of many hospitals , * but the result offered hope that other such outbreaks might be arrested or avoided . Last August , babies born in Port Huron 's red brick , ivy-covered hospital and sent home as normal began to be readmitted with diarrhea . Some died . Laboratory tests indicated none of the three commonest causes of the disease ( bacteria of the Shigella or Salmonella groups , or a virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursery . To cut down cross-infection , babies were kept in their mothers ' rooms . But by year 's end the death toll had reached 34 . <P> Desperate hospital officials called in Dr. Albert E. Heustis , Michigan 's Health Commissioner . Dr. Heustis and his staff sent to Scotland and Denmark for samples of a peculiarly virulent strain , previously reported only from Europe and catalogued by Danish experts as O-111 , of the normally harmless coliform bacteria . An identical form was found in the bowels of 90% of Port Huron 's infected babies . <P> Dr. Heustis , " greatly enthused over the significance of these findings , " believed that Port Huron 's outbreak was licked . He warned doctors elsewhere to be on the lookout for O-111 , and suggested the use of sulfathiazole for early treatment . <P> Last week , in 50 fecal samples from infants in the hospital , one of Dr. Heustis ' bacteriologists found two containing O-111 . One infected sample had come from a baby who had died of diarrhea , the second from a baby sick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> *Every year thousands of U.S. infants die of epidemic diarrhea . A 1944 outbreak in Texas killed 1,372 - more than the nation 's death toll that year from polio .
