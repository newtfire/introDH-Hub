THE bees are swarming ! The bees are swarming ! " Shall I hear that cry on Resurrection Morn ? Then I shall rise ? quickly , running , snatching , panting , moaning my utter unfitness for Heaven and bees . I wo n't be ready that day for the swarm . I am never ready for the swarm . From May to Septem ? ber , at home and abroad , my uneasy head wears a crown of swarming bees . They will be my eternal reward and punishment . I shall keep bees forever , and forever they shall swarm . The most futile passage in the round of the year , my moment of utter un ? worthiness , is when I stand gaping after the dark swarm drifting over the ridge of impenetrable sprout-land . Then I would my hill were a mountain to fall upon me . My strongest colony , too ! It is al ? ways my strongest colony ; and always at a critical moment in its career ? usu ? ally at the height of a honey flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ! ) , were I a commercial bee-keeper ( I am a lover ! ) , I should conquer the swarm ; at least , I should control it enough to insure my honey crop , and so could take my margin of absconding swarms as banks take absconding tellers ? backed by a bond , though , of course , never quite without a moral shock and great social loss . But I can not commercialize and insure my love . Runaway swarms are sheer infidelity to me , pure moral loss . Love ought to be businesslike , but it is not ; love ought to overhaul the colo ? nies every ten days for queen cells , cut ? ting them out and clipping queens ' wings to hinder swarming , but only busi ? ness regularity does that ; love ought to supply ample space , fresh combs , and a succession of young queens . Love is the most miserable thing in the world . A man will work all day for love and then bring home a white hair net when her charge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should have no part or lot in bee-keeping . Love takes on too many bees ; neglects them too often ; trusts them too far ; and weeps when they swarm . And the worst of it is every bee in the wayward bunch is a female ! This makes it hard to bear . It is a feminine revolt against masculine neglect and lack of male control . And it is more : but how much more is a question as old as bee-keeping . If the bees followed an invariable rule in swarming we could soon discover why ; but there are no rules , no laws , no fixed conditions , no two swarming cases ex ? actly the same , though the symptoms are always the same . You can tell when , if you watch , but the question of why do they swarm goes still unanswered . The most obvious reason would seem to be the overcrowding of the hive : when the hive boils over with bees they naturally boil out as a swarm . Some ? times they naturally do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil over and stick like pitch to the front of the hive all through the honey flow . Lack of ventilation is another popular explanation : hives with small doorways , when unshaded in a July sun , become in ? tolerably hot , and naturally the bees swarm out . And , as naturally again , they stay in and store honey all summer . That ancient rhyme , " A fly is a fly because he flies , A flea is a flea because he flees , But a bee is a bee because she bees , " is almost final in questions touching the ultimate things of life and bees . A colony of bees is perhaps the best regu ? lated society known , and yet , among the honey bees , as nowhere else in nature , the very spirit of Caprice seems to rule . What , however , can we expect in Ama ? zonia , where motherhood is deliberately restricted to one in thousands , and is promoted by sororicide , and is consum ? mated in a marriage-flight attended for the lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ; and where all success , both political and industrial , is at the cost of universal self-immolation and a sterile virginity ? What is a swarm of bees ? An answer to this would also answer the " why " of the swarm . Apparently , it is a part of the colony , the larger part usually , made up of the old field-bees , leaving the old hive with the old queen for a new home . Back in the old home are the young bees , the brood in the combs , the entire fur ? niture of the colony , together with a young queen , or one , or several , about to hatch . The colony has divided , has multiplied itself as the single-celled amoeba divides and multiplies itself , but not from the same biological necessity . The anneha must divide or perish , and the race perish . But the bees could live on and on in their hive or hollow tree without dividing . The swarming spreads the race , insures against disease and in ? breeding , gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of these things seems biologically necessary . Nor is the swarm politically necessary , though it looks primarily like a political move ; the population crowded within the city walls migrates and colonizes as did the populations of ancient Greek cities . But the number of souls in a bee city is strictly within the keeping of the government . By regulating the food of their queen , the bees can regulate her egg-laying , can lower the birth rate or increase it to meet hunger , or plenty , or the capacity of their walls . Thc swarm is not the result of overcrowding , of ahousing problem , I am sure , nor a colo ? nizing project . It is not political , but it may be spir ? itual , a response to some inner urge to adventure , that restlessness and reach for the horizon which Browning says is Heaven . Who knows what is the col ? lective soul of this multiple , intelligent , and self-immolated body ? Dying all day long for to-morrow , living only for the future , the bee-people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resolute children , By those swarms upon our rear we must never yield nor falter , Ages back in ghostly millions frowning there behind us urging Pioneers ! 0 Pioneers ! " So they work and dream , and one day , far-flying scouts bring news of it ? of a forest of bass-wood , yellow with bloom ; or hills adrift with white clover , or meadows of mint and heartsease and goldenrod ? away yonder beyond the ridge of sprout-lands . I could look far off at sea except for that ridge of sprout-lands , and down the Cape where the Mayflower anchored , and the beginnings of our first immortal hook were brought to shore ! These tales of the scouts ex-cite the eager tribe , breed discontent , wake wild adventure , till every quickened wing is humming : " These arc of us , they are with us , All for primal needed work , while the fol lowers there in embryo wait behind , We to-day 's procession heading , we the route for travel clearing , Pioneers ! 0 Pioneers ! " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guess , but woefully lacking in solid scientific backing . It may be that the swarm is caused by the hardening of the brood-combs and the choking up of the cells with pupa cocoons . Every grub about to hatch leaves its swaddling clothes as a silken lining , incredibly thin , round the walls of its cell , but these skins in the course of the years so choke up the cells as to render them unfit for the brood . The old bees , not able to renovate the combs , find it easier to move out and build new ones ? and so the exodus ; for bees , like men , must make bricks , and neither Red Seas nor sprout-lands can stop them seeking straw . This theory is not convincing , be ? cause it hardly accounts for the regu ? larity of the swarming habit , as sure as the summer with most bees . In spite of our breeding and better appliances , I wonder if the swarming fever is not as certain to occur now as ever , and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a single season 's use rendered the combs unfit , there might be some ? thing in this theory ; but combs last ten to twenty years . When I moved here I found on the place a colony of bees in a home-built hive , which according to a lead-pencil line inside the door , had not been disturbed since 1862 ? for more than forty years ! A strong colony occu ? pied that hive , a colony which had been bred in those thickened , blackened combs . It would seem that the neces ? sity for a move so infrequent as once in twenty to forty years could hardly have led to an acquired habit as regular as the annual swarm . Whatever the cause , it is resistless and highly dangerous . Nothing in the colony life is fraught with such hazard as this change of house . It is a mad adventure , the bees themselves know not whither . They have safeguarded the portion of the tribe left behind in the old hive ; they have gorged themselves , eaten their passover for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iYi their midst ; but nothing more , neither pillar of cloud by day , nor fire by night , nor morning manna , nor promised land . If the wind blows east , then east they drift , down the first chimney flue on their errant course , or into the top of any tree , with ? out fixed plan or place , or foresight , or common bee-sense ? a wayward , heed ? less multitude , their madness and their scanty stores soon spent , in sore need of a home . They may find a hollow tree or a knot hole into your attic or an empty kennel , or they may cluster in the open on some tree limb and go to comb-building there . One frequently comes upon a cluster of bees in the New Jersey woods clinging to their brood-combs depending from a limb , brood and queen and workers frozen in the dead of winter ! The spring of 1921 was very " early , " the whole winter so mild and open that my bees swarmed in April . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apiary , their vitality so low from ex ? posure that there was not heat enough in the cluster to melt the light snow which had fallen and covered them dur ? ing the night . Most observers believe that the colony , previous to casting the prime swarm , sends a band of scouts to scour the country and find a new home , and that these scouts return and take charge of the trek . Bees have been frequently noticed about an empty hive , going in and out , inspecting it apparently , and shortly afterward , from a few minutes to a few days , the swarm swoops down and takes possession . One of the best of such scouting stories is told in the A. B. C. Book of Bee-Keeping . Bees were observed in numbers at a hole in a hollow tree , and the bee-hunter , think ? ing , of course , that the tree was full of honey , cut it down . But there was no sign of bees in the cavity . While the hunter was still in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and here out of the blue , in the open space left by the felled tree , and at about the height of the opening , hung the moving swarm . It was the scouts that he had first discovered , the house-hunters . They had gone to fetch the swarm after deciding upon the new home , and had returned to find the roof ? tree fallen . I believe the story , not the interpre ? tation , a case of coincidence , rather than of leadership . Out of scores of decamp ? ing swarms I have known very few to pack off with apparent purpose , most of them clustering on the first inconvenient limb , and clustering again if shaken awing . Finally making off , the fugitives would be next heard from , if heard from at all , clustered somewhere in the open a mile or two away , where they might remain for days . Naturally , they de ? sire a hollow for a home , box or tree , or pillar , or chimney flue ; and once the swarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used up , and the queen heavy with eggs , we can readily believe that searchers are ordered in all directions to spy out a home . But I can ? not think that any worker-bee ever threw down her tools , kicked off her apron , and rushed out in the tumult of the swarm , not knowing or caring whither , or with any intention of ever working again . The swarm frenzy subsides as quickly as it rises , into languor and lassitude as marked as its first violence . The whir ? ring cloud in the air heads for a tree ; a knot of bees as big as your thumb clings to a limb , arid before you can quite be ? lieve it , the knot is a bunch as big as your fist , as your head , and half as long as your body , the whole excited swaying multitude gathered to it , bee clinging passively to bee till the limb bends , and often breaks , under the inert pendulous mass . I have sawed the limb off many a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you might put a sleeping child into its crib , without dis ? turbing a drowsy bee . There are other observers who believe that the swarm is only a frolic , that these soured spinsters , grim and toil ? worn , revolt at their loveless condition , strike against their endless day , and in high revelry swarm out with their over ? worked queen , riotous for a giddy frolic , and that the dance is led by the queen herself . Poor thing ! she leads nothing , knows hardly enough to he foolish , and for most of her life is actually fed by the workers , a piece of the hive machinery , more instrument than being . She is not at the bottom of this vast stir . No event of these proportions , involving thefate of the whole colony , and prepared for days ahead , can be of her initiative . Nor is it the work of a moment 's madness . The swarm , I think , in its strange be ? havior , may be a manifestation of thwarted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call the colony , where the individual has lost riot only sex but self , till the will and the instincts , along with vital bodily or ? gans , are socialized , fused by the heat of the whole into a group-will and instinct , the very flame of desire but ashes smol ? dering in the heart of the colony to burst for a brief moment into the roar ? ing fire of the swarm . The fire is but a flash , instantly burned out , and futile and barren . Not a male bee is in the multitude . Every one in the swirling flame is female ? ex ? cept the queen . At the center of the vortex is the queen , who is not a female , but a male and a female , bearing in her body , since her marriage-flight , the vital organs of the male , a dual creature , bride and groom complete , producing from one body both male and female eggs . It is she who is at the center of the swarm ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that the veiled vir ? gins hover when the flight stops and the cluster forms , because she is mother of the race , yes , and because she is lover and bridegroom to this immaculate or ? der , mate to this unmated , unsexed sis ? terhood , which is foresworn and immo ? lated for virginity , incapable of mating , yet capable of laying infertile eggs , be ? ings in perverted bodies ? spirits mocked and thwarted , utterly , fiercely feminine , consumed for this mad moment with desire . Clumsy guesses these at the riddle of life , and only a bee 's life at that ! It is all a riddle , as all of our knowledge is but a guess . A riddle , yet a terrible , beauti ? ful , ordered fact ! We should stop with the fact , with what we think we know , rather than prying thus into the hidden , grope with bare hands among the mighty currents back of this mysterious swarm ? ing world . The play 's the thing the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines , not the stage machinery , the tawdry properties , and the shirt sleeves of the manager within the wings . Who can keep bees , however , except he love them ? And who can love with ? out wonder , seeing behind the moment 's ornament " A creature breathing thoughtful breath A traveller between life and death ? " Bee-keeping is more a state of mind than a course of action . It constantly upsets one 's settled order , makes for ex ? periment , and compels speculation . Life so complex , so artificial as this highly organized society of the bees , has been " ' an evolution , slow and difficult to trace , showing atrophy and obsolescence , the very swarm , it may be , the spent effect of some powerful primal cause , time , the transformer , having stepped-up or down the voltages of life 's currents whose sources lie hidden back among the time ? less hills . There are some simple , effective methods for controlling the swarm , but none for curing the fever , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation of it . One works among one 's bees with veil and gloves . But what truth do we ever touch with ? out gloves , or see except from behind a veil darkly ? The science of bee-keeping is written in a book . Science has been long at work among the bees , upon their wonderful and fearful anatomy , their beautiful chemistry , their biology , and political economy . Matter has yielded many a secret to science and must ulti ? mately yield all . It is the mind in mat ? ter that baffles science , this purpose and emotion in the swarm . Yesterday a terrific tempest broke loose over Hingham , the lightning play ? ing havoc with telephones and trans ? formers , splintering trees , and in the neighbor town tearing off the end of a house , stunning and nearly killing three of the persons within . Only the day be Yor , CXLV/1. ? No. fore in a Massachusetts laboratory the scientists made artificial lightning of two million volts . The visitors saw : A realistic electric storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been constructed in the laboratory . Lightning in blinding flashes appeared and crashed from the make-believe clouds , strik ? ing the village church steeple about which were grouped the village store and three farm houses with green meadows . The buildings were struck simultaneously , but there was no damage , for it was lightning controlled . The experts and visitors were only fifteen feet away from the lightning bolts , some of which split hard maple . . . . In this crash for a small part of a millionth of a second is concentrated millions of horse ? power , equivalent in fact to all the electrical power in America . Although lightning trav ? els at the velocity of fight , 186,000 miles per second , engineers . have been able to measure the shape of the flash and determine its pressure . . . . Lightning is literally an electrical explo ? sion . Enormous power at tremendous volt ? ages is dissipated in a fraction of a millionths of a second ; matter is torn apart and " ex ? ploded " away . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin picked the lock of the thunder cloud with his kite and copper key . But how little I could tell Virgil of the mind of the bee ! I do not catch my runaway swarms as he did , by scouring a hive with bruised balm and honey-wort , and then , when the creatures are in the air , " make a tinkling round about " and clash the cymbals of the goddess , Cybele . I could laugh Virgil out of that , and tell him to clip his queen 's wings ( as indeed those ancients did ) ; I could show him a mod ? ern American hive that might almost turn him from poetry to bee-keeping as a business ; I could show him how , with the movable frame , we make a " shake swarm , " but I could tell Virgil nothing about climbing trees . Virgil , no doubt , climbed many a tree for his swarms . It is awkward , and it might be impossible for a poet or a politician to climb a tree . But if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks last summer , and every colony took to the tall timber . I had three stump speeches to make one afternoon , and was leaving the house when " The bees are swarming ! The bees are swarm ? ing ! " brought me to a short , quick halt . Jumping from the automobile , I grabbed veil and ladder and saw , and ran for the garden . The bees had al ? ready clustered , a golden pendulous mass half as long as my body , a monster swarm , about thirty feet up in a tall red oak . I was up with my saw in a hurry , had the limb off ? and let it slip ! Never had I lifted such a cluster . Instantly the whole tree was in a whirl of bees , tens and tens of thousands of them , like a sudden storm , thick cloud and darting humming hail about me , as if to pitch upon me . I did not wish to be the center of the cluster thirty feet in the air with three stump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt too popu ? lar ? if a stumping politician can . I was not on the stump , but up the whole tree . The day was excessively hot , and I was dressed for politics , not bees , be ? sides I had on a heavy veil , thick gloves , and I was in a hurry . A labor union was having a picnic over at Rockland , where I was due to speak before the baseball game . This wretched swarm of bees might make me miss the United States Senate . But it was the biggest swarm I had ever seen ! What if a man should win the - United States Senate and lose such a swarm of bees ? If only voters would buzz about me like this ! But I was a Democrat , running on a League of Nations , anti-Tariff , bone-dry platform in Massachusetts ! It was just as well to stay in the tree , for the bees were clustering again , this time clear in the top above me , on the slender central stem , nearly sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sagged down , wrapping about the stem as thick as a stovepipe and six feet long . I climbed up , dangerously up , till the swaying top began to bend under me , the greatswarm directly above my upturned face in the very top and round the slender central stem of the tree . The slightest jar , and down upon me the deluge ! And if I sawed the top off without scattering the cluster , I could not possibly handle the great weight . To shake them free again , even if there were no danger of their sailing away , in ? volved other dangers , instant and mo ? mentous , that would put me out of poli ? tics permanently . I wished indeed that I were out of politics at that moment . There was no help at the house . One 's wife is no particular comfort in such a time of trouble ; besides , I must have her new clothes line . I descended quickly , slipped into the laundry for the line , and was once more climbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line fast about the stem close up under the drowsy cluster , I took a bight or two about the nearest branch below and started to saw , gently bear ? ing the stem over as I worked , until it swayed , bent , and sank softly with its ticklish load under the quiet saw . I aided it to come evenly over , steadying it with my hand while the whole cluster was gradually reversed , hanging top downward , not a single bee disturbed . I was now above the bunch , and taking up all slack in the line to save any pos ? sible jolt , I sawed the bent top through , and it swung free . Leaving it fast there , I went below , cutting out the limbs along the trunk for a clear passage to the ground , where I arranged an empty hive so that I could lower the cluster directly in front of it . Then I climbed back , eased away on the line till the tip of the cluster gently touched the earth before the open door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I began to think of my speech again as I clambered down . Giving the cluster a quick shake , I stopped just long enough to see the golden multitude begin to pour into the wide door . One of my wet rivals got the party nomination at the primaries , and on elec ? tion day came so near to beating High Cost Living , the Republican candi ? date , that I am sure I could have done for him . But , then , I got that glorious swarm of bees . " A swarm of bees in May Is worth a load of hay ; A swarm of bees in June Is worth a silver spoon ; A swarm of bees in July Is hardly worth a pie . " old style , back in the days of the straw skep and the sulphur bath . Modern bee ? keepers sing in new style , to rhyme with May and pray , June and swoon , July and die , so great an evil is the swarm in the present-day apiary , so unprofessional indeed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peak of the nectar flow , and not only shuts down the works for the day , but permanently divides the force and puts an end to the harvest . It is as if all the field hands on a sugar plantation at cane-cutting time should strike and move away . It is the field workers who go out with the swarm , and for the rest of the harvest season they must devote every energy to furnishing their new home with brood combs and stores for the winter . They seldom have either the time or the strength to gather surplus for the bee-keeper . And behind in the old hive , after the swarm leaves , are only young nurse bees concerned with the cares of the great household , burdened with the multitude of babes , as many , it may be , as three thousand of them only one day old , and an equal number two days old , and as many four or five days old , and all to be fed ; but after the fifth day the bee-milk and honey-food is stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silken shroud and falls into a profound sleep , to wake with wings and with wisdom , wisdom that my plummet can not sound . A single , powerful colony of bees will store more honey working together in a season than when divided by the swarm . There is double the housework to be done after the swarming , and while thereare two queens building up twice the working force , the chances are that the short honey flow is over and the harvest done before either colony is ready to store it . And quite as bad is the broken spirit of the hive , the morale of the pow ? erful colony . Nothing among the bee people is more marked than the spir ? itual force we call morale . Weak and hungry colonies never have it , but only fear , suspicion , and anger instead . Stinging bees are the hungry , unhappy bees , lacking stores , or a queen , or a pur ? pose . In a powerful colony on the other hand , sheer numbers , mounting toward the hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifting and maintaining the morale of the whole at a high level . They are power , physical power ? heat , hum , and action , early and late work , swift winds through the comb-walled streets , overflowing vats , wealth , and expanding room , story on story of sealed stores as the harvest ripens and the singing workers with every dawn speed faster and farther afield . Not even an army of soldiers is more dependent on this pitch of the spirit , this frame and temper , than the bees . Listlessness and lassitude over ? come them as they do us ; they loaf , grow sulky , become dispirited , dwindle and die . Individual as we are , yet no bee can survive alone , nor seem to fly farther than the radiating power of the colony , nor work without regular and close contact , charging her spirit from the generating dynamo of the hive . Many a bee has been caught by the dark and survived the night in the open fields ; you can send ten bees and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bee by force , or order , from the spiritual body of the colony , and death seems to follow instantly as a psychic , rather than as a physical change . And so the new swarm , all experienced work ? ers , brimming with power and unham ? pered , but not without imperative needs , falls to in its new home with unparal ? leled energy , making combs as at no other time , the morale of the colony a singing , building , conquering something , as real as wings and honey wells and fields of scented clover . The first symptom of swarming fever is the queen cell , but not until the egg appears , and later the young grub float ? ing in the royal jelly , need you feel alarmed . Then the fire begins to burn . A day or two more , the big cells are capped over , and the crisis is near . Taking a clean hive furnished with frames and sheets of foundation wax , and ready for instant service , I go about the routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the overhanging pines , after the small work is done . If I am forehanded , I can prevent the bees from swarming by shaking them out into this empty hive , making sure the old queen goes with them , or , as I usually do , I can cut out the queen cells to delay their swarming , hoping that they will get over the fever , for every day means honey in the supers if only I can keep the mighty throng together as a single working force . I have carried them through the apple-blossom season without a break , and into the thick of the wild-raspberry flowering near the middle of June . Since early spring the colonies have been rapidly gathering strength and momentum until now from some of the hives a mighty host of ' reapers are in the field , and singing as they toil . The vale , the hillside , the overshadowing pines , and my own soul are overflowing with the humming harvest song . No other sound in nature is like the song of work , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuned to ? the little wire in my neighbor 's kitchen , the line between the planet 's poles , and those mighty cables of space that catch the turning of the spheres and the wing ? ing of the bees , broadcasting the univer ? sal song of doing from star to star . I am content to listen in . My own hands have wrought here . I have en ? tered into this labor . I am conductor for this symphony of the bees . They are in tune with me . Or is it that I am intune with them , and in tune with the Universe ? Then suddenly , a distinct lull in the steady hum ! A wrong note ? in the hive next to me ! Bees are not corning and going straight from this hive as from the others . They are buzzing about the entrance , crowding deep on the alighting board , and running excit ? edly like robbers over the whole front of the hive . Every colony in the garden has heard the sound and stopped to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled and quick for the stampede . An indescribable change has happened to the song of the apiary , pitch , and time , and tone ? from soft to loud , from high to bass , from quick Lo slow ? swifter than the April sky can change or the swooping squall can strike the sea . The even , all-pervading hum of wings has developed suddenly into a loud storm ; a cloud of bees has gathered in the sunshine , a whirling waterspout among the hives . The entrance of every colony is covered with excited watchers , but the storm is central over the hive next to me . The noise grows louder and higher , a clear approaching roar that drowns every other sound . The smok ? ing wings and molten bodies pour forth from this hive as from a volcano . The cloud thickens about the hive as the fire burns , the roar of the storm increases ; and now the great swarm swirls free into the air . Have the bees sucked poison and the whole garden of them gone mad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out beyond the pines into the air as far as eyes can see , and swiftly moving , drifts from under the drooping bough 's into the open sky . The cup they have tasted is swift , the delirium faster and faster working ? spinning , gathering , crowding , driving them higher and higher till only a dark stain of the storm is seen , a little cloud no larger than a man 's hand against the golden blue . Then the cloud is washed from the sky and the swarm is gone .
