VIOLETTE A STORY BY VINCENT SHEEAN T HE passage of Violette Maucourt . through the world of political journalism created not a little stir in its time . For three years she was everywhere ? at international conferences , at the League meetings in Geneva , at the centers of postwar trouble here , there , and the next place  --  and then she was seen no more . The last I heard of her , a year or two ago , she was teaching school in her native Rouen . Our eonfri'res never did understand exactly why she appeared and vanished with such definite completeness . To this clay in the bar of the Victoria at Geneva or of the Adlon in Berlin you will hear the correspondents of English , French , American , German , South American newspapers saying , " I wonder what ever happened to that pretty little French girl who used to work for the Rived Parisien ? Best woman correspondent I 've ever seen " ? and other compliments of a doubtful nature . It scarcely matters how I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Constantinople and elsewhere , by what bits from Picard and bits from Eversleigh I formed such a coherent idea of what happened to her . The fact is that now I think I understand the motive and manner of her departure : every step of the thing is as clear to me as if I had assisted at it all . I can see her , a slim red-haired young thing in a pale green dress , standing on the glassed-in terrace of the Palace Hotel at Lausanne , staring out at that hillside of gardens and moonlight withthe most scentless and moonless thoughts imaginable . No great issues were determined by her decision , but I am sure that when she made up her mind it was the result of a genuine , if unexpressed , communication with a larger reality of existence . I think what happened was that she saw her own life and its governing impulses very clearly from the outside for a few moments  --  long enough , that is , to spurn it forever . She began by being a poet . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French girl of good Norman family who inexplicably produced a volume of delicate and rather beautiful verse at the age of twenty . Her poetry was successful enough to bring her up to Paris for a prolonged visit , on which she met and married , under circumstances of the most unimpeachable respectability , Armand Maucourt of the Rheil Parisien . He was one of those sharp , hard , bright phrase-makers whose columns of political comment are so often the terror of French politicians ; more than once he and Picard between them had produced a government crisis . Maucourt survived the marriage only a year , and when he expired in the midst of a Venizelist coup d ' ? tat in Athens , his widow promptly continued his work where he had left off . Her dispatches to the Rived Parisien were not even interrupted by the funeral , and she was the first person in the whole international press to obtain a comprehensive interview with the Cretan on his return . It was considered very callous of Violette to throw herself so suddenly into her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did it under the nervous compulsion to do something . In any case her work was first-rate ( better , many people thought , than Maucourt 's own ) , and when she at last returned to Paris she found that his job was hers . One of her first achievements thereafter was the overthrow of the Briand government after the Conference at Cannes . She was at Cannes ( she , too , could play golf ) and was one of the group of three or four French political correspondents whose bitter dispatches caused such excitement in Paris . The Premier returned to Paris suddenly , walked into the Chamber , made a speech , and resigned without even asking for a vote of confidence . It was a matter of public knowledge that this result had been brought about by the terrific sarcasm which animated the daily articles of Violette and Picard and that other writer who uses a Roman word for signature . This was a great triumph for Violette . After Cannes she went everywhere . She was very pretty , very chic , very clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe . Naturally she became a celebrity in her own world . Conferences happened with bewildering frequency in those days ; there was current some sort of Gallic superstition about a thing called " reparations " ; and at close intervals the statesmen of all the Western Powers would abandon the affairs of their governments in order to huddle together and discuss the Great Unknown . At a time when magic formulas about " gold marks " and " paper marks " envoisoned the air , and the lowest term in diplomatic arithmetic was a thousand millions , Violette kept her head . With brilliance , precision , and pertinacity she continued to disbelieve in it all . There was something uncanny in her instinct for sham ; she seemed almost to possess an intuition , a power independent of the reasoning faculty , which warned her of the presence of anything bogus , And since practically everything is bogus at an international conference , this came to be recognized as her characteristic attitude . It was n't cynicism ; it happened quite apart from her conscious opinions or wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no staggering powers of mind . An easy way to label the quality would be to call it " woman 's intuition , " which it may possibly have been . At any rate , when she came to the Lausanne Peace Conference at the end of three years of this sort of thing , she was one of the most remarkable young women in Europe . She had been everywhere and knew everybody she needed to know . Her faculty for acquiring information was fabulous ; often we had to wait until the Rhea Pari , s-ien arrived to learn something of importance we ought to have known the day before . Violette would always give the rest of us whatever she had , however  --  if she happened to see us and happened to think of it . " By the way , " she would say , tapping her cigarette holder on the side of her pert little nose , " I dare say you know that Curzon 's going home to-morrow ? He 's fed up , I expect . Needs a change of air . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of English she spoke , easy and casual , not as if it hurt . Her French was very pure and precise , but equally effortless . And her clothes ? well , after Violette appeared at the first important party at the Bean Rivage half of the women there sent to Paris for more dresses . She used to be asked out to dinner with such regularity that in my opinion she never paid for more than one meal a week , exclusive of breakfasts . I hope she made due allowance for this on her expense account . She was n't much of a barfly . Occasionally she would go into the bar of the Palace Hotel for a cocktail or a glass of sherry with a fellow-journalist , but generally she stayed ' away from such professional places of assembly . After the warm weather began ( and you may remember that the Lausanne Conference lasted a long time ) she used to be seen at tea under the trees in the garden of the Beau Riv age , sitting with one or two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to be remarkably impartial as to nationality ; she would have tea with the Turks and dinner with the British and luncheon the next day with the Italians ; and they all caused her equal amusement . With the Americans she played tennis , and used to beat them at it , too . The one delegation with which she did not seem to be on the easiest terms was the French ; but this was obviously because they were afraid of her , and it detracted nothing from her general popularity . The most extraordinary thing was that in spite of her youth and good looks there was no scandal about Violette in all this time . How strange and rare this is can be appreciated by anybody who has lived for weeks or months on end in the atmosphere of an international conference in a place like Lausanne . Those calm and beautiful surroundings , leafy gardens above a fiat blue lake , called for some sort of romanticism . And since most people in the diplomatic world were too elderly or too careful to enjoy less devious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gossip . It was in late May or early June that Violette Maucourt and young Eversleigh suddenly became the main subject of Lausanne 's lighter conversation . Eversleigh was a secretary of low rank in the British delegation , and could n't possibly have been in the Foreign Office for more than a year . Ik was one of those tall , bleak , blue-eyed , blond young Englishmen who look so much alike that they ought to be distinguished by numbers rather than names . Every conference has a certain number of these , and Violette must have known dozens of them in the preceding three or four years . Yet in that utterly unac countable way women have she fell in love with this particular one . I say fell in love , and I feel sure the statement is sound ; she made no very public pronouncement on the subject , and was always ( or almost always ) correctness itself under observation , but just the same she was in love . It showed itself at first only by a certain added brilliance and intensity when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal , and having occasional meals ; and presently they both began refusing invitations in order to go off to Pouilly and places like that together to dine alone . Sometimes they could be seen tramping along the road by the lake , miles from anywhere , simply drifting through the heavenly weather of a warm spring at Lausanne . On such occasions they appeared not even to recognize the interested observers who passed them so often in motor cars . Naturally this aroused excitement in the small world of the conference hotels and gardens . At the Palace , where the French and Turkish delegations and most of the journalists lived ; at the Beau Rivage , which rejoiced in the patronage of the British , Americans , Italians , and Rumanians ; and even at the Royal , which housed only the Greeks , there was the liveliest interest in Violette Maucourt and her blossoming romance . The altogether exceptional character of Violette was not alone responsible for this ; Eversleigh was , in spite of looking exactly like all the other young men from the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , his father was a peer of very high rank , which gave him one of those elegant and improbable courtesy titles ( his name was actually Lord George Eversleigh ) . For another thing , he was engaged to be married to the daughter of a still more important personage , and everybody knew the wedding was supposed to take place as soon as the conference ended . Under these circumstances the social life of Lausanne became almost pleasur-1 able . Bored ladies of the European delegations , who had scarcely enjoyed anything since the assassination of the Bolshevik delegate , were now to be seen putting their heads together with the utmost maliciousness and engament every time Violette and Eversleigh appeared . It was said that things had gone very far indeed . It was said that the head of the British delegation ( not  --  fortunately for young Eversleigh  --  not the terrifying Curzon , who had departed long ago ) had reprimanded the boy for making a show of himself . It was further said that the boy had made a very unbecoming reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters did not improve before long somebody would have to write to His Nibs , the boy 's father , and see what could be done . The delighted ladies of the European delegations were of the opinion that the projected marriage would have to be postponed or even broken off ; and they were grateful to Providence for having given them the privilege of witnessing what London and Paris could hear about only from them . The situation was in this stage when I dined one evening with Violette and her young man . It happened quite by accident , and I can assure you I did not enjoy it ; I was as superfluous as any elderly bore is likely to be on such occasions . But I could n't help myself . There I was sitting by the lake on the terrace of that tiny restaurant at Pouilly , when in came Violette and Eversleigh . The place is minute  --  there are only four or five tables  --  and it was impossible for us not to dine together . If they had taken a table by themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Violette realized this at once . " Oh , hello , Mr. Turner , " she said in the most natural way in the world . " Are you dining alone ? Do you mind if we join you ? Is n't this a divine little place ? We 've walked all the way from Lausanne through the most interminable sunset . I 'm famished . " " The food 's marvelous here , " said Eversleigh gloomily . I was sorry for him but there was nothing I could do . The waiter brought another chair and more hors d'oeuvres ( I had just begun to eat when they came in ) . The table was bang-up against the wall of the little garden , and on the other side of the wall Lake Geneva was looking , for once , absolutely enchanting . The sun was not quite all gone , and what was left of it turned the quiet sea into shimmers of opal and pearl . That night there was something very dreamy , almost Italian , about it , although I must say I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances I was terribly sorry for Violette and Eversleigh , who certainly ought to have been dining alone . To make matters worse , some fool in a boat out on the lake began to sing in a liquid , heart-breaking voice which was carried to us faintly and beautifully through the watery sunset light . It was all too unbearably romantic , and I had no business being there at all . " How did you happen to come out here alone ? " Violette asked , beginning on her radishes . " Are you being melancholy about something ? " " No , " I said , " only bored and old . I 've had enough of Lausanne . It seems to me I 've been here forever . Do you think these infernal treaties will be made by Christmas ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " Picard thinks we shall still be here in August . " " I certainly hope so , " said Eversleigh . After he had spoken he seemed to perceive that his speech revealed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'oeuvres with vigor . Well , of course it was all right for them , staying in Lausanne . I tried to imagine  --  and could n't  --  what love in such an ultra-appropriate setting would be like . I had to east my mind back a good many years to think of anything I could relate to these two . They were so young that obviously the water and sky and the leaves of the trees must merge for them into a general promise of happiness . Things which I observed , they felt : the difference is incalculable . They hardly appeared to notice the exquisite light on sea and opposite mountain ; and yet this light , all these tremulous intensities , were certainly component parts of their June enchantment . I wondered if their fates would have been the same if they had met in Paris or Rome or in my native Iowa . It is always so difficult to tell just how and why anything happens ; any event is mysterious enough , God knows , but none so mysterious as the event called falling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Eversleigh , " more than almost any-thing . " Violette suddenly began to do her celebrated imitation of Poineare . She made a long speech about Swiss butter , talking through her pretty little nose in the style of the French statesman . " Au fur et a mesure des paiements de l'Allemagne . . " It was really very funny and we all laughed a good deal . Then Eversleigh told us the latest stories of the British delegation , and we discussed the deafness of Ismet Pasha and the decorations of the Beau Rivage ballroom , and presently the sun went away and left us there in the soft , luminous dark of the stars . I was consumed with pity for Violette in particular . Eversleigh would probably get over it in time , I thought  --  no British diplomatist can afford to cherish a despair  --  but what of poor Violette ? She had been conspicuously free from sentimental entanglements ever since I had known her . Now she had got herself into a perfectly appalling mess , and I failed to see how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . If Eversleigh had not been so publicly and solemnly betrothed to a lady of high degree there would have been no very important reason why he should n't marry Violette : she was far nicer than most of the wives one saw about . But for Eversleigh to marry her now would be a scandal of ruinous proportions . And in any case Violette was too French , too bourgeoise , to permit him such a sacrifice . I felt perfectly sure that there was no idea of marriage in her head . Whatever the issue might be , she could not take a course which involved the rearrangement of other people 's lives , the disturbance of hopes and plans in which she had no share . They were not monotonously blissful . No , indeed ; it was something much more revelatory than that . They alternated all through dinner between states of bliss and states of obvious despair . For example , when Violette reached for another radish and found them all gone , Eversleigh , having consumed the last one , looked suicidally unhappy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity to its opposite : so subtle , strong , and strange is the hypersthesia caused by romantic absorption in another human being . At times during the dinner I simply ceased to exist for them , and I must say that these were the only times when I felt really comfortable . At last the meal was over . It was a soft and starry night and they were going to walk all the way back to Lausanne . As we rose from the table Violette and I were left alone a moment by Eversleigh . She stood quiet , looking at the lake . She had on an uncolored linen dress and a flopping wide hat ; she was all simplicity , uncertainty , and I could not help touching her hand in a , fatherly way . When she spoke there was a little catch in her voice . I am still very susceptible to catches in the voice . " Oh , Turner dear , " she said swiftly , " tell me , when you were younger , on a night like this , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . nothing to happen any more at all ? " " I can scarcely remember , " / said , " but I know what you mean . " " Qa serait si beau ! " she said vaguely to the silent water . " Si beau ! " I got into my car and went chugging back to Lausanne , leaving them far be-hind . They walked home , no doubt , through the lush springing stars , unaware of their divine ridiculousness . They had put me into such a mood of melancholy sentiment that when I got back to the Palace Hotel I had several whiskies and argued politics until far into the night with some truculen LTiu-ks . This was a great waste of time ( Who can argue with a Turk ? ) but it was better than remaining hypnotized by the spectacle of Violette and her young man . The next day I saw them at tea at the Beau Rivage and ran away from them . At my age such emotions are too exhausting to be endured more than about once a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July  --  that matters came to a climax in the affairs of Violette . It happened on the night of a large party at the Beau Rivage , one of those hotel dances which the conference attended en masse . The Americans , the British , the Italians , and the Rumanians all had large dinner parties that night , and afterwards they took their guests into the ballroom to dance . I am not quite sure now which dinner party Violette went to , but it seems to me it was the Rumanian one : the Rumanians always had the best luck in the way of guests , and the least formality with them . Eversleigh was , of course , with the British , and I happened to be with the Americans . When we came into the ballroom the British were already there , and I could see that young Eversleigh was as nervous as a cat . He kept watching all the doors , which was rather hard on the ladies he was supposed to be talking to . There were so many doors . Finally Violette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all nationalities , among whom she moved with her customary grace . It was probably imagination , but I thought there was just a touch of lassitude , of melancholy , which made this familiar manner of hers even more attractive to-night . She wore a pale-green dress with white roses on the shoulder in the American fashion ; she had picked up a good many Americanisms , Anglicanisms , Italianisms in the past few years . Her hair  --  that marvelous red hair of hers , so smooth and glowing  --  was worn very tight to her head ; skin and eyes had a curiously living texture to them . It was almost as if she knew something important , something definite , was going to happen . I am sure there was n't a prettier woman in the room , or a more interesting one . Everybody looked at Violette these days . Not even the most exalted personages could pretend unawareness of her . This was n't altogether because of the growing scandal about Eversleigh ; it was also because Violette 's beauty had become something really thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was too outrageously romantic , too perfectly composed , set , and illustrated , not to be a source of envious delight to all who witnessed its development . Eversleigh made a bee line for Violette as soon as he could , which was in about ten minutes . They danced together once and then vanished in the direction of the garden . For what happened afterwards I must ask you to take my word without inquiring too closely into my sources of information . As I have already told you , the thing took shape in my mind bit by bit , fragment by fragment , and at that time I saw and understood nothing . I did get to know Eversleigh pretty well afterwards in Constantinople , if that 's any help to you ; and old Picard told me a few things , and by and large I feel that my version of the affair must be the correct one . When they walked out into the garden they were at the apex , at the crazy very summit , of the painful ascent called love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk in the usual way about what had taken place at her dinner party , repeated some of the witticisms of the witty Rumanian minister , told a story about the one impassive Turk , very ancien regime , who had been there at the enemy 's board . But such conversation was no good to them . They walked about among the trees from dark to light and back again . There were a fair number of other people wandering in that garden , since it was a warm night. ; but at a given moment they came to a place which seemed impenetrably hidden . Here Eversleigh broke down . " Darling , darling , " he said . He swept her off her feet and they were entangled in one of those furious embraces which a man of my age can scarcely remember , much less describe . How long this continued I am unable to say , but when he could speak again Eversleigh began to plead wildly with her , a la cantonade , and she to resist . " I ca n't stand it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jove you too much . I do n't care what we do but we must get away from all this and live our lives in our own way , dearest . I do n't care about my silly career . I want to chuck it and be happy . Darling , darling , I ca n't marry that silver statue I 'm engaged to . I ca n't go on like this . The only thing I want in the world is you . You ca n't be happy otherwise , either . There 's plenty of money . We can go to Italy or Greece . We can get married and forget that there was ever anything but ourselves in the world . . . . " And so on . To me the most astonishing thing in the whole business has always been the behavior of Eversleigh . You ' , mow the sort of man he is : infinitely noble , with an eyeglass and a Curzonian voice . I never can quite bring myself to believe that these handsome imperial instruments share in the ordinary human passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eversleigh was prepared to do all the things his own people considered intolerable : he wanted to break the most solemn and public sort of engagement ( thereby probably ruining the life of the distinguished young lady in London ) , " chuck " his career and run off to some vague Arcadian pasture with Violette . Neither of them was what you would call an eloping kind of person . Violette had the tyrannical sense of propriety which afflicts everybody born into the old bourgeoisie of France ; a hundred grandmothers revolted in her at the least mention of anything unsuitable to her standards or condition . Besides , she loved the boy , and from her point of view she could only ruin him by the course he begged her to take . And as for Eversleigh , if anybody else had done what he now wished to do , he would have said " Damned cad " several times in extreme contempt and cut the blighter off his list of acquaintance . They were both behaving in the highly uncharacteristic manner produced by such abnormal psychological states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been for them if Eversleigh had won . Trailing in Byronic decadence from town to town in Italy and Greece , growing steadily more fed up with each other , Violette longing for her own work and he for his . . ugh ! No ; you can never make a pattern out of an accident . She won , of course . With great tenderness , but very firmly , she talked to him about responsibility . She pointed out how impossible it would be for either of them to be happy upon the basis of other people 's unhappiness . She even went so far as to mention the transitory nature of desire and the extreme insecurity of relationships established by it . This superinduced another outburst from Eversleigh . But when it was over she had not altered her intentions , although she was willing to grant , to save argument , that he might conceivably love her forever . She held to the opinion that the best thing they could do would be to see each other no more . It took every ounce of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what he asked ; her desperate , reeling senses were his allies . But her conduct of life ( like her work ) obeyed some sort of exterior rule . What she wanted to do had simply no relation to what she ultimately and permanently did . Perhaps it was those hundred grandmothers ; but at any rate she held firm . Along towards the end of this very fatiguing scene Violette mentioned that she had a career , too . " Your career . . . ! " said Eversleigh , savage and white-faced . " Your career ! It 's the only kind of career in the world that 's sillier than my own . We at least try to get something done ; all you do is talk about it . " She was silent ; she really did not care much about her career at that moment or what he said about it . But he was swift to beg her pardon , and every change of this sort was the pretext for more embraces . She did not resist them ; she was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling her ? He was telling her something designed to make up for what he had said about her career He was giving her information  --  very important information . Perhaps you remember that in the last phase of the Peace Conference at Lausanne one of the chief questions in dispute was that of the Ottoman Debt . The old Ottoman Empire owed a great deal of money borrowed before the War , and the new Turkey was very reluctant to pay any more than was absolutely necessary . Most of the debt was owed to the French , who always have had a strange propensity for making bad loans . The French said that this old debt ought , to be paid in gold francs , since it had been contracted in prewar francs . The Turks said that it should be paid in paper francs , since the depreciation of the franc was not Turkey 's affair . If you asked me now I should be quite unable to tell you how the thing was finally decided ; but in those days it preoccupied us all a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point . The difference to the French bondholders ran into many millions . and whatever decision was made would inevitably have a great effect on the Paris stock exchange and probably on the fortunes of the French government of the day . It really was the most troublesome question the French had to work on during those endless last weeks of the conference . The attitude of the British was likely to be , of course , a determining factor in the affair . The British had avoided taking position hitherto ; they were anxious to conciliate the angry Turks and afraid of irritating a fretful ally . What Eversleigh was telling Violette in the garden of the Beau Rivage under such highly improper conditions was that the British delegation had decided to throw the full weight of their influence on the side of the Turks on this question of the Ottoman Debt , in exchange for some concession they wanted in another field of debate . The thing shook Violette out of her trance . " But dearest , " she said , " what on earth are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's sure to be the end of Poineare if he has to give in . Are you telling me a secret ? Plow secret is it ? " " Oh , nobody outside our delegation knows it yet , " Eversleigh said . " Neither the Turks nor the French know it . It wo n't be communicated to them until to-morrow morning . Then in the afternoon it will be announced in plenary session . The thing 's a deadlock , you see , and we 've got to do something one way 0 or the other . The Turks have made an interesting proposal , and were going to accept it and back them . " " Well , what do you expect me to do about it ? " she asked . " Write it , " he said . " It 's my contribution to your career . I give it to you gladly . You 'll be the only journalist in the world who knows it tonight . To-morrow they 'll all get it in the communique . " " But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you telling me this ? Are you authorized to tell me ? If I write about it in the Reveil Parisien everybody in all the delegations will know I learned it from you . The effect in Paris would be serious . " " I know , " he said . " I understand all that . But do n't you realize that I love you ? I adore you . If your career is important to you it 's important to me too . I 'd do anything for you , dearest , anything . " This went on for a while longer , but at last they came to their senses and realized that they could not stay out in the garden all night . When they returned to the ballroom about a third of the crowd had gone home . Violette was pale , exhausted ; Eversleigh looked rather grim and heroic . Everybody in the place stared at them as they came in . It was the most shocking thing they had done yet , going out in the garden and spending hours there when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted with a distinct chill when he returned to the British table . Violette had better luck ; the kind and clever Rumanian minister ( unless it was the clever and kind Italian delegate ) instantly asked her to dance with him , thus showing that in his opinion she had a perfect right to spend the whole evening in the garden if she pleased . She was too tired to stay long , however , and very soon she pulled her shawl about her and went home . Her host sent her up the hill in his Rolls- , Royce , although some more important guests had to walk ; that was the sort of thing people were always doing for Violettc . On the way up to the Palace her journalistic instincts were reviving confusedly , but with increasing strength . Presently she began to make little phrases . " Cetie intelligence britannique , qui a toujaurs su qu'on pale inieux avec l'argent des autres . . " What an article she could make of it ! The thing marshalled itself in her mind : a cruel , biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . She would tell them to throw away the one she had telegraphed in the afternoon ; this should be dictated by telephone . It was not yet one o'clock and there was plenty of time . She would begin by stating the fact ( this was one of the practices whichmade Violette unique in French political journalism : she always began by stating the fact ) . Then she would lash out against the selfishness and perfidy of the British , the rapacity of the Turks , and the stupid weakness of the French . She would show that the French taxpayer , the French citizen , who had ultimately to pay for all this folly and crime , had been deceived in the quality of his leaders and allies . This was just the sort of article she did best : sarcastic , bitter , incisive . She took an extraordinary delight in it ; it made her relive all the moments of her keenest critical assurance . After all , she had done a great deal at Cannes to bring down the Briand government ; could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not impossible . Certainly the government ought to have bad sense enough to realize that they could never count on the British , and arrange to meet some such crisis as this . Now they would he caught napping ; they would lose hundreds of millions of the savings of the French people in a perfectly indefensible piece of diplomatic chicanery . Her indignation mounted as she reached the top of the hill . She got out of the minister 's car and ran upstairs to her room on the first floor of the Palace , intent on the article which had already taken form in her mind . The Palace Hotel had arranged a special room for the journalists during the conference . Two girls from the post office were on duty in this room until half past one in the morning , putting calls through to Paris . Practically all the French , Americans , and British sent their material out in this way ; it was swifter and cheaper than the telegraph . The correspondents ' telephone room was on the ground floor in a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violette telephoned down from her room to ask one of the girls at the desk to stay overtime for her . She would have an article to telephone to Paris , she said , before two o'clock . Meanwhile she asked them to put a call through , warning her office that it was coming and that it would be important enough to hold the paper for . Then she went to work with rapid pen on hospitable foolscap paper . The phrases came surging out on the paper with breathless ease ; the article wrote itself . Nobody escaped : the British , the French , the Turks , even those who had had little to do with the affair , such as the Americans and the Italians , received their deserts . ( I saw the article the next day and can testify that it was the most brilliant and devastating column Violette ever wrote . ) When she had finished she went downstairs without rereading the piece and made her way to the telephone room . As soon as she appeared , the girl at the desk put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communication was very swift at that hour of the morning . In two minutes the call would come through . There was nobody else in the room , and Violette stood by the opened easement looking down the hill towards the shining moon upon the lake . It was then that everything happened to her . She thought of Eversleigh . She had completely forgotten Eversleigh while she was writing the article  --  but completely , completely , even though he was the most important object in the perceptible world . Now , as she stood looking out at moon and Iake , he came back to her with all the importunate anguish of reality . Why did such things happen ? She wanted to go to Italy with him , to Greece or wherever he pleased , to escape from the encompassing contrariety of circumstance . The trees of the garden all moved and whispered in the warm night . Why had Eversicigh told her about his delegation 's decision on the Ottoman Debt ? Why ? Was it not clear . . too clear ? The perception of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would be disgraced , dismissed . Everybody would know he had told her . It would be the end of his career , or at least would make it far easier for him to end his career himself . Thus everything he wanted  --  everything she wanted too , yearning as she did now over the tops of the trees to the silver shadows on the lake below  --  everything would be within their grasp . She leaned weakly against the casement . Oh , God , she thought , why do such things happen ? " Your Paris call , madame , " said the girl at the telephone . Violette hesitated only a moment . Convulsively , with unneeded energy , she took the pages of foolscap she had written on and tore them down the middle and threw them on the floor , where they lay derelict , so many silly scraps of paper . All those phrases . She passed her hand over her hair and turned to the telephone . " I called to tell you that I am ill and ca n't go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take dictation at the Paris end . " I must leave Lausanne to-morrow . That 's all . Do n't argue . Good-by . " She came back from the booth slowly . The girl at the telephone was jamming on her hat , ready to depart . " You look ill , madame , " she said sympathetically . " Do I ? " said Violette . She stood by the casement window again . Picard  --  good old Picard , one of the keenest of French journalists and a fanatical admirer of Violette 's  --  came in and watched her . " You do n't look well , Violette , " he said . She turned around , startled . " No , " she said . " I do n't see how I could . " She was pale under her smooth red hair and her eyes were very tired . " I 've had enough , Picard , " she said listlessly. -I 'm going home . " " What 's the matter ? " said Picard . " You need a little rest , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody to-night . I 'm sure I did . " She looked at him , puzzled . " Why ? " she asked very softly , her eyes growing wider . " I mean , of course , about the Ottoman Debt , " he said . " You got that , certainly ? The English have decided to support the Turks against us , and we 're sure to lose now . The Turks learned the news to-night and communicated it to the whole press . " She was looking very odd , he thought . She even staggered a little and leaned more heavily against the casement . " So you all knew that , " she said . Then she laughed . Picard says it was a woeful little laugh . " I did n't send anything about it , " she said . " Poor Rhea Parisien ? That 's what they get for having a woman as correspondent . " " It 's not too late , " said Picard , picking up the sheets of foolscap from the floor . " This is your article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post office and telephone it for you . " " No , " she said , frowning intently . " Do n't do that . I 've just done a rather decent thing and I 'm not going to spoil it now . I do n't care what happens to the R  --  veil Parisien . Or to me . I 'm done with all that . " Picard did n't know in the least ( and does n't know to this day ) what she was talking about , but he listened with all his ears . " There 's a certain validity , " she said , " a certain integrity , a certain honesty in a clean decision . And I 've made mine . " " You 're talking at random , " said Picard . He was genuinely worried about her by this time . " All right , mon vieux , " she said with a sort of weary affection . " I suppose I am . But it does n't seem very important to me whether those particular phrases get into print or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and smiled . " All those words , " shesaid . " What good are they ? I 'm going to bed . Good-by , num VieUX . " He stood looking after her as she walked wearily , graceful in her pale-green dress , to the dark , waiting door . The roses on her shoulder had wilted . He did not telephone her article to the Revell Parisien , but kept it and showed it to me the next day . Well , of course none of us saw Violette again , and the peace conference came to an end , and Lord George Eversleigh married his silver statue . What else could have happened ? I really do not remember what became of the Ottoman Debt : but Lord George Eversleigh is now a Counsellor of Legation exactly like all other Counsellors of Legation , and Violette teaches school in Rouen , and Picard and I go on from conference to conference , year after year , wondering what is to be the outcome of them all . Very probably Lord George Eversleigh sometimes thinks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or looks suddenly out a window at a garden with trees , of those impulses which moved him to strange speech and action on a night in Lausanne seven years ago . A good many things  --  radishes , green dresses , Swiss butter , the moon on quiet waters  --  make me think of Violette from time to time . At my age one no longer resents a criticism if it quickens any part of the perishing sense of life ; and although Violette 's departure was certainly a sharp and profound criticism of the existence of all the rest of us , I do not mind the sense of her disdain . I shall go on without change , of course ; so will everybody else ; but I like to think of the torn papers lying on the floor at Violette 's feet that night , of her red smooth hair against the casement window , of the silver rustle of the garden 's trees .
