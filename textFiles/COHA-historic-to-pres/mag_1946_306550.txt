From Spain a TIME correspondent brought this report : <P> The winds that blow Spain toward economic bankruptcy are sharper now than ever before . High prices for food fan the little man 's desperation to a sharper pitch . The stink of governmental inefficiency and corruption is rising above normal . But the best guess is that Generalissimo Francisco Franco will probably not reap his whirlwind just yet . For he holds as tight as ever the only windbreaks that count-the army and the police . <P> Walk along Madrid 's Gran Via in the early evening-the hour of the Paseo . Smart women in furs and well-dressed men jostle along the avenue , huddling in their mufflers against the chill wind from the Guadarramas . Street lights gleam on neatly cleaned streets , on the chaste , well-stocked windows of expensive stores . The roadway is crowded with French , German , Italian , British and American automobiles and with rickety taxis that are always full . <P> Behind the discreet curtains of the cafes , crowds jam the tables drinking wine or coffee and eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Silent , grey-coated policemen stand discreetly in the background with little to do . Order is so perfect that Spaniards-against all their temperament-wait for the green light before they cross the streets . <P> That is show-window Spain-sleek , animated , and very , very expensive . <P> Life on $1 a Day . But go instead to the house of , say , a streetcar conductor about 10:30 p.m. , when most Madrilenos eat dinner . Ask your host , who earns less than $1 a day , to show you his week 's ration of food at controlled prices . He can put it in a soup plate . His wife may serve to a guest the best dinner they have had in weeks-soup with meat and noodles , a dish of chickpeas , cabbage and sausage , with an orange for dessert . To buy that meal for four people , he had to spend $2.28 on the black market . And in his household , where two people work , the combined income is $1.80 a day . <P> Most Spaniards agree that if Franco could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept his police state without too much grumbling . <P> On the Chute . Spain 's economy is sliding inevitably down the chute to bankruptcy . Since 1936 Spain has had little new machinery . Its railroads are 50 to 20 years out of date and seriously inadequate . The three years ' drought has ended and reservoirs are full , but Madrid still has no electricity three days a week for lack of efficient dynamos . <P> The Caudillo should be given his due . Spain is orderly and there is relatively little crime-thanks to police in overwhelming numbers and varieties . In recent months there have been fewer political arrests and no political executions . The Falange is currently on the wane-to the gratitude of every Spaniard except the Falangists . There has been a certain mellowing over the years ; individuals may criticize discreetly , although the newspapers are still government-cast stereotypes .
