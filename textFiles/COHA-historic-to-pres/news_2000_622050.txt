Loretta Cooks used to be a heroin addict who lived in a gritty hotel South of Market . Now she 's known to her neighbors on Treasure Island as " Auntie Loretta , " the lady who pops popcorn and has a weekly movie night for the neighborhood kids . <p> " I 'm proud to say this may be the best neighborhood in San Francisco , " said Cooks , 47 , who is among the first wave of 175 disadvantaged San Franciscans to live at a bargain price in decommissioned military housing on the former Navy base on Treasure Island . <p> " Once you 're through the gate , you can feel that homey atmosphere , " she said . <p> The words " homey " and " military " are not usually linked , but ever since the Navy leased the abandoned base to the city , an unlikely transformation has taken place in the Ozzie-and-Harriet subdivision on the north tip of the island . <p> Former drug dealers and once homeless alcoholics are living contentedly next to Internet developers , teachers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space of half a year  --  easily the most diverse neighborhood in San Francisco . <p> It also represents a unique  --  and unintended  --  experiment in social policy : Substance abusers and homeless people are being helped simply by virtue of living in an isolated suburban environment . Although only 6 months old , the experiment seems to be a success . <p> " Self-esteem is built up simply by having a pleasant place to live , " said Connie Cramer , program coordinator of Swords to Ploughshares , an agency that aids veterans . " It 's so different from the Tenderloin out here . " <p> The city 's Treasure Island Development Authority , which has set aside nearly 25 percent of the cracker-box-style homes for use by the homeless and the disadvantaged , partly as a result of a 1994 government mandate . The re-sult has been a multicultural neighborhood created almost overnight . <p> " It 's a real smorgasbord . This would be a sociologist 's dream study , " said John Stewart , the president of the real estate development company that rents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ordinary San Franciscans . A two-bedroom unit rents for $1,700 per month . <p> The remaining 222 units are divided among a variety of nonprofit charities for use by people trying to get their lives back together in place where liquor stores are nonexistent and drugs are hard to come by . Many of the apartments are given to qualified residents for free . Others are rented at a deep discount . <p> The nonprofit houses are scattered randomly through the honeycomb of homogenous streets , so there is no charity ghetto . <p> Catholic Charities , for example , rents Treasure Island houses to 28 impoverished families who might otherwise be homeless . Cooks is one of the lucky ones who got assigned a home . And she is grateful . <p> " You do n't have to worry about walking down the street , like in the Tenderloin , where everything smells like urine and you have to watch your kids , " she said . <p> Her neighbors are unlike any she has had in her life : a California Highway Patrol officer , a computer engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scents of freshly cut grass and seawater waft through the windows . <p> One of her nearby neighbors , Dennis Sutherland , has views from his modest apartment that few in San Francisco can beat : the Bay Bridge out the front window and the Golden Gate Bridge off the patio . He has been in rehabilitation since August , trying to shake his old demons . <p> " I split up with my wife and pretty much went down the tubes , " said the 43-year-old Army vet . " I was living in hotels in the Tenderloin , getting drunk , doing drugs . I was n't always like this . I was stuck in it and did n't know how to get out . I admire people who can go to Alcoholics Anonymous and stay with it . I ca n't do that . " <p> Sutherland found his apartment through Swords to Ploughshares , which also helped him find a job as an electrician as a part of his drug recovery program . <p> He said he feels the tension inside of him unclench at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasure Island . <p> " It 's real tranquil out here , " he said . " I grew up in the suburbs , and this is something that I 'm used to . It feels more normal here than in the city . " <p> Verdell Price , on the other hand , is still trying to get used to Treasure Island . The 35-year-old father of three was living in a cardboard box in an alleyway off Sixth Street before he started a drug treatment program with Walden House and took up residence with two other former addicts . <p> Price , 35 , said he can feel the market-rate residents staring when he walks down the street . <p> I do n't really think they appreciate our presence out here , " he said . " I want to see something like a block party where all the neighbors can get to mingle and know each other . " <p> There are plans for an islandwide party this fall , although a firm date has not been set , said Sherry Williams , the executive director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential trouble , the San Francisco Police Department opened up a special station on the island . <p> But issuing speeding tickets and breaking up domestic disputes seem to be the only crime-fighting activities for the Treasure Island detail so far , police say . Occasionally , San Francisco residents who come over to admire the view will bring some narcotics with them , but there have been no substantial drug busts as yet . <p> " One of the biggest problems is the seagulls bombing the police cars , " said Sgt. Joseph McCloskey . " That 's about all that happens out here . Citywide , I 'd say this is the most peaceful district there is . " <p> Steve Slade , a computer game technician who just moved into a former Navy house with his wife and 5-year-old son , said he 's had nothing but good interactions with his neighbors so far . Residents of Walden House walk past his driveway every day on their way to the bus stop and one day , they stopped to help him unload some heavy items from his car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and nobody did anything like that for me there , " said Slade . " It 's a real neighborhood out here already . " <p> Surplus military bases have been used to house the homeless since 1994 , when a new federal law required city development authorities to set aside space for the homeless on closed bases under their governance . <p> California leads the nation in the number of military bases that have become havens for the homeless . Of the approximately 25 bases nationwide that have designated units for homeless housing , 11 are in California , said Laurel Weir , policy director for the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty . <p> About 100,000 needy people nationwide are being helped by the reuse of military bases and other vacant federal properties by social services , said Weir . <p> Treasure Island has an " unusually high " ratio of its units set aside for the needy , according to Bernard Frieden , a professor of urban planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . <p> Other cities with castoff military bases have not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new asset . <p> Several municipalities have gotten around the 1994 law by simply gauging the value of the buildings that would have gone to the needy and donating an equivalent sum of cash to local charities , said MIT urban planning researcher Christie Baxter . <p> San Francisco , which has a 15-year lease on Treasure Island , is expecting to make $45 million over the next seven years by leasing most of the rental properties to the John Stewart Co.
