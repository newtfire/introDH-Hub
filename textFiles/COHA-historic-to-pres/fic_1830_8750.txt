" Oh Love ! what is it in this world of ours . Which makes it fatal to be loved ? Ah ! why With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers . And made thy best interpreter a sigh ? As those who doat on odors , pluck the flowers , And place them on their breast , but place to die . " Byron . Main text Scene Elphina . Elphina Thou canst not mean it , love ; nay , thou canst not ! This talk of parting is an idle tale , Which thou , in jest , hast breathed , to scare my heart . Recall thy words ; again look sweet on me , And all I will forgive , and all forget . Julian . Julian My fair Elphina , ' t is alas ! too true . Were I to yield unto my heart 's desire , Thou wouldst be ever all the world to me . I feel that we must part , and in this hour Must all thy hopes of joy , and mine , convene ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one drop of perfume were distilled , For all the blessings of a life of love , Must be concentred in this single hour . Elph . Elphina What dost thou say ? Jul . Julian Elphina , we must part . Elph . Elphina What spell is o'er thee sweet ? am I not kind ? Do I not smile whene'er I meet thy smile ? Am I not in thy presence ever bless 'd ? Yea , let me speak beyond my virgin blush , When thou art near , the moments have a speed That will not pause for counting . I 'll not hear Of parting , love . Jul . Julian It must be so , Elphina : A fate hangs o'er me , which impels this course , Against my heart 's desire . Would ' t were not so ! Elph . Elphina Who in love 's calendar hath ever read , Else than the heart approves ? Jul . Julian Alas , alas ! Elph . Elphina Why Julian , dost thou sigh ? Art thou not well ! Jul . Julian I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Elph . Elphina I understand thee not : what dost thou mean ? Jul . Julian I 've gazed upon thy face , fair one , and felt A holy calmness overspread my frame : I 've listened to the magic of thy song , And then , have felt as if celestial sounds Fell on mine ear , and sweetly soothed my thoughts From the dark broodings of this nether world . When in the summer evenings we have sat Mid'st budding bowers , where varied petals op 'd To show their lovely flowers ; or , when we 've strayed . At morn ' mongst fields of tedded hay ; or eve , Along the tressled windings of the grove , When moon and stars have smiled upon the scene . I 've felt a presence that exalted me , E'en to a par with seraphim . I knew Not then , how firm , nor yet how close entwined . Around the jesses of my heart thou wert , Till reason whispered we must part : ev'n now . ( For in thy presence I am happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  Yet , part we must  --  this meeting is our last . Elph . Elphina O ! torture not my heart with such strange words . Jul . Julian The rare perfections of great nature 's hand , Are all convened upon thy lovely form . As now I gaze upon thine angel face , Where the sweet rose , and sweeter lily strive For masterdom ,  --  I sigh thou art not mine ! O when I meet the glance of that blue eye , So like the dove 's  --  yet gentler ,  --  from the which . All that we dream of brightness and of truth , Is imaged forth  --  I sigh thou art not mine ! Yea , in the spring-time of thy virgin years . When all the blossoms on love 's sacred tree Are peeping forth , which first enthralled my heart In love 's wild maze  --  I sigh thou art not mine ! And when I hear thy voice , O sweeter far , Than ever poet feigned , or fabled goddess , Murmured of old from her rich perfumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elphina Am I not thine ? I love thee with a warmth unknown before , And only live for thee . Where'er thou art , There is a charm , where thou art not  --  a blank . When I have mingled in the heartless rounds , Of giddy fashion , and thou wert not there , With thy bright eagle eye , to light the scene , A dimness and a languor spread around , When I have sat beside my own dear hearth . And thou wert near  --  it was a heaven to me ! Then wherefore sigh that I am not thine own ! Jul . Julian An evil fate sits frowning o'er our hopes : ' T is the ascendant . What can drive it thence ? Elph . Elphina Dost thou not love me ? Jul . Julian Yes , Elphina , yes ! I love in all the poetry of passion , Holy and pure , and in the wild romance Of young and bright imaginings , I doat On thee alone . Were destiny my gift , I would not give thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victor 's laurel wreath . The trump of same , the envy or the homage Of millions born , or millions yet to be , Compared with thee are as the passing wind . Elph . Elphina As love can conquer all , and as I love More fond than woman ever loved before , We 'll conquer sate , and be forever one . And thou shall love me too  --  indeed , indeed ! I see a blush o'erspread thy manly cheek , And thy bright eyes beam with a kindly glance . Thou dost relent ,  --  I know thou dost , my love . How thy dear heart doth coil ! thou wilt be kind . And I 'll forget that thou wert ever else . Jul . Julian Yes , I am kind , and kind to thee alone , And love thee dearer than the saints above , But evil fate frowns darkly o'er our day Elph . Elphina This is a madness , or a mockery . I told thee , that I loved : ah ! never more Let woman tell the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deceitful man , Knows that he 's loved , he loaths the heart that loves . Jul . Julian Elphina , thou dost wrong me : ne'er before Hath mortal ever suffered wrong from thee . Paragon of women . Who can control The dreadful mandates of imperious fate ? Call thou this madness ? if thou wilt , call me The maddest of my sex : within me reigns A strange presentiment of ill . I am The fool of fate  --  the victim of despair ! Upon my heart , my destiny is writ , In words eternal , traced by demon hands In characters of fire : it burns , it burns ! Elph . Elphina O this is madness in extremest sway . Thy placid features , and thine eye of love ( Which oft beamed on me with so kind a glance ) Are all deformed by some mysterious spell . I know not what thou mean'st : pray thee explain . Jul . Julian I had a dream  --  a wild , delirious dream ; A sybil , frowning , stood before my view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At her command , in this , then that I gazed ; Gods ! what a sight was then revealed to me . In this , I look 'd and lo ! I saw thee stand Apart from me : though for a time , dark clouds Hung o'er thee like a pall , yet soon the sun Pierced through the gloom , and then they day of life , Shone like sweet summer in her rosy prime , And on a comely youth anon thou smiled'st He took thy hand : until the going down Of thy sun 's being in the peaceful west , Nor cloud nor storm frowned over thee or thine . Now mark ! in that , I gazed  --  there wert thou linked With hapless me . All shone serene awhile , But clouds soon gathered thick around us twain . And mounting to the zenith , met in darkness . Each fair and lovely thing , was then enwrapped In gloom profound : the wrathful tempest scowled  --  The thunder roared , and the wild lightning scathed , And desolation spread her ruin round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Wearying on in sadness and distress , While I , a blasted trunk , defiled the earth . Hopeless and sad , thou then wert all alone , None near to heed , or help thee on thy path O it was terrible , and I could gaze No more ; my sense was wrecked  --  my eyes were sered , My brain was crazed , and madly I awoke . O God , O God ! it was a horrid dream . Elph . Elphina What ! hath an idle dream alarmed thee thus ? Thou'lt think no more o n't : it is folly all . Jul . Julian That horrid vision I shall ne'er forget ,  --  It haunts my dreaming hours my waking thoughts , It fires my brain , and writhes my mind on racks . I will not link thy destiny with mine : Elphina , no ! To thee I will not prove , Like the rank sea-bird to the branching tree That shades old ocean 's marge  --  where'er it perches . Leaflet , nor blossom ever smiles again ; Yet still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves the trunk , its pestilence hath sered . Not so with me : I part to see thee bloom , In all the richness of thy virgin prime  --  Then choose another 's hand , and live in joy Think not of me ; my sate may do her wors I am content , so that thou suffer'st not . Eph . Elphina Speak not to me of joy : without thy love ; I 'll pine and waste away , like autumn 's rose . To me , content will be an empty sound , And every sweet and lovely thing deformed . I 'll never leave thee ,  --  thou shalt be mine own , And all fate dares , we will together brave . Jul . Julian Clouds in the glass awhile lowered dark on thee , But soon they passed  --  a cloud is o'er thee now . I am resolved . Give me thy harp , Elphina . Eph . Elphina O yes ! Thou'lt touch it with thy master hand , And wake its notes of richest melody . O may the witchery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to love . ' T is said the soul , upborne on music 's wings , Soars to a region , where eternal bliss Brings all discordant things to harmony . ' T is echo 's palace , where the truant winds Straying , like fancy , ' mongst celestial chords , Where waters murmur , and where sea shells roar ,  --  Where wild birds carol , and where flowers perfume  --  Where gems shed forth delightful streams of light , Where every leas pendant from golden boughs , Where all that is , create or increate , Of bright and beautiful , of rich and rare , Compose a choir , the poetry of sound , That so enthrals the heart , it doth restore , The placid sway of love to man once more . Jul . Julian I touch it , but to sound one-strain ' twill be . The sweetest and the last , I wake for thee : These burning pangs , the music will reveal . But with frail words , too weak for all I feel , I will breathe forth my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than never wake again ! THE SONG . I knew thee lady when thou wert , A gay and rosy child ; And marked thy beauty opening fair . As fate upon thee smiled . I know thee now , when thou art grown . To woman 's high estate : With all the charms convened on thee That e'er on mortals wait . Too oft thou dear one , have we met . Both for thy peace , and mine . I dare not longer trust my heart To bow at beauty 's shrine , For thoughts are gathering o'er me fast . Which bid my bosom beat . With hopes , alas ! too wild and vain , Then wherefore should we meet . The wild flowers on my being 's path , All faded in their bloom : An evil star frowns over me , And hapless is my doom ; I would not in thy rosy prime . A blight upon thee cast ; Bloom on , bloom on , apart from me , My first-love and my last . I never knew , how closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel , fate decreed that we , Should , love , forever part :  --  And part we must , although the thought Distracts my breast with pain ; ' T is , for thy sake alone , not mine , We never meet again . And now , obedient to the sybil 's spell , Elphina we must part ; farewell , farewell .
