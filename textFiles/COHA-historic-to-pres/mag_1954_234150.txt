For more than a century , electrical engineers have sought a kind of philosophers ' stone : a cell that will turn chemical fuel directly into electricity . They have had little success , but the present means of generating electricity by first burning fuel in a heat engine is so inefficient ( seldom better than 30% ) that they have kept on trying . A fuel cell , theoretically , could be almost 100% efficient . <P> In Britain 's B.E.A.M.A. ( British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers ' Association ) Journal , Engineer F. T. Bacon of Cambridge describes the most hopeful approach so far to a practical fuel cell . Bacon uses two diaphragms of porous nickel set close together with an electrolyte ( a solution of potassium hydroxide ) between them . Hydrogen gas at the pressure of 800 Ibs. per sq . in. seeps through one diaphragm , oxygen through the other . They combine in the electrolyte , and the energy of their " burning " appears as electricity , not as heat . <P> A single cell produces less than one volt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch thick , many cells can be stacked up in series to give higher voltage . The efficiency can be as high as 77% . Bacon believes that his fuel cell can also be used as a kind of storage battery ; it can burn hydrogen and oxygen made by decomposing water with surplus electricity when demand is low . Later on , he hopes , it can burn air and impure hydrogen made with coal .
