As on the previous day , the Steel ' and Iron stocks were yesterday the dominating influences in the market , and by far the most extensively traded in . And , as was not unnatural In view of the developments , the Steel and Wire shares were the most conspicuous of the group . Indeed , if the Street hears it aright , Steel and Wire will for some time to come furnish the sensation for the Stock Exchange . The report yesterday was that it was not so much the steel - and iron industry that is in a bad condition as it is the Steel and Wire Company itself  --  that , in short , the affairs of that corporation are in such a wretchedly tangled condition that all its mills are to be closed down . Chairman Join W. Gates , approached on the subject , said he had nothing whatever to say . Certain elements in the Street , assuredly , whether justifiably or not , believe that developments in connection with the affairs of the company may in the immediate future so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was even talk yesterday of meetings that were held to consider action looking to relief in the matter , but nothing official could be gotten . The fact is that the controlling Directors of the company all belong to one speculative clique and are credited in Wall Street with being aggressively committed to the bear side of the stock market . Inasmuch as they know the inside affairs of the company , their position is regarded as significant . President Lambert of the company has been summoned to New York and will arrive to-day . The recent pyrotechnics of the stock have so influenced financial sentiment in the Street that bank and trust companies alike are in many cases refusing to accept the stock as collateral , while in other cases It is accepted only at much below its market value . Federal Steel and other steel and iron stocks likewise are being discriminated against . A As for fhe movements of the stocks yesterday , there is little to be said of any save Steel and Wire , all the others being more or less stable . Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuel and Iron % , and American Tin Plate % . Steel and , Wire , however ; made up fov the comparative quiet and inactivity of the others in the group , over 64,000 shares of the common changing hands at a net loss of 3y , , points , and over 16,000 of the preferred at a net loss of 4 points . The loss was almost all scored in the afternoon , short covering in the morning having held the quotation well up . In the afternoon .. however , on comparatively few sales , the price steadily receded . One of the features of the day 's trading was in the late afternoon . The stack was quoted at 44% , when Mr. Louis Wormser went on the - floor and bid 44 for 1,000 shares . He was promptly accommodated by Mr. Jacob Field , who on the Stock Exchange is credited with acting for inside interests . Mr. Wormser thereupon bid the same price for another 1,000 shares , and was again accommodated by Mr. Field , Once more a like bid was made ; once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How much more are you willing to sell ? " he inquired of Mr. Field . " Oh , a matter of 17,000 shares to begin with , " quietly answered Mr. Field . Mr. Wormser left the floor  --  and the stock in a few moments sold down to 411/4 . The close was at 41% . Shortly after the market closed , officers of the Steel and Wire Company were quoted as saying that in spite of denials , some of the mills of the Federal Steel Company would be closed down this week . This story has several times been denied by the Federal Steel officers . Rogers , Brown &; Co. , in a circular issued by them , say : " The iron trade in this vicinity has been treated to a new sensation in the week under review . The making and selling of iron and steel has always been a legitimate and conservative business , and never before have the Elrie Railroad methods of the Gould and Fisk days been introduced into it . It is needless to say that the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockholders and are not working Wall Street , feel that a stigma has been put upon the whole business . How far the injury done may extend to legitimate business is a question . It is much less of a question , however , than it would have been had it happened before the character and methods of the chief operators became so well known . " Dealing with the iron and steel situation , The Iron Age will to-day say : " Those who have been working to secure lower prices for iron and steel have been ably reinforced from an unexpected quarter during the week . It is quite unusual for men representing large producing interests to come out plainly and say that the trade is suffering from overproduction , and that heavy reductions in prices are to be expected . Ordinarily , such conditions are cqncoaled as long as possible , and concessidns are made secretly , so as not to alarm the trade generally . But we are now being treated to an apparently frank admission of a serious congestion in important branches of production , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire nail factories and wire mills have been shut down to enable an accumulation of stock to be worked off . They were not all shut down at once , as erroneously reported , but during a period of a week or more . " Representatives of other important branches of the iron and steel trades deny the right of wire manufacturers to speak for them , and claim that iron and steel prices generally have not been threatened with the danger of a collapse . Reductions have been made , but they have been brought about gradually and naturally without disturbing the trade , and no sharp tumble in values is expected unless this development in the wire trade should produce such an effect . " The week in other respects has brought forth indications of improving business . Large Western consumers of foundry pig iron have placed heavy contracts for extended deliveries , among the buyers being some of the shrewdest members of the trade . The movement thus begun was , reasonably expected to spread to other consuming interests . Even in the East , where buyers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase in greater quantities was being manifested . Orders for export have been larger . This business will probably be checked for a little time , as the new conditions here were promptly cabled abroad . But if it is foand in time that prices have not been demoralized by what has happened , it is believed that the endurance of this trying experience will have quite a reassuring effect on both home and foreign trade . " The most important event of the week in finished steel was the placing of a contract for approximately 80,000 tons or plates , shapes , be .. required for the construction of the rapid transit tunnel in New York City , which was secured by the Carnegie Steel Company . The price is not disclosed , but the statement is made on good authority that it was close to rulin rates . " The reduction in the West of $5 per ton on merchant steel bars and bar iron , announced as a proof of rapidly declining . prices , was merely an open acknowledgment deleted 2 lines     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
