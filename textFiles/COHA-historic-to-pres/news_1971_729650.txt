Speculation that newly enfranchised 18-to-20-year-old voters in the United States will swell the ranks of the Democrats now is beginning to be supported by statistical evidence . A nationwide survey by The Christian Science Monitor has found early registration trends favoring the Democratg in New York , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware . New Mexico , Nevada , Arizona , Oklahoma , California , Oregon , and North Carolina . Although the youthful trend toward the Democratic Party seems clear , the reports often speak of young people generally identifying themselves in polls and interviews as " independents " or " nonaffiliated " This would seem to mean that no matter how these youths are now registering  --  or are going to register  --  there will be a high degree of independence in their voting , both in the primaries and general elections . But where early registration figures are available the strong Democratic trend is clear . The Monitor report from California reflects this : " Early registration figures of 18-to-20-year-olds show from a 2-to-1 to as much as 5-to-1 Democratic preference Among some university students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange County traditionally solid Republican early registrations favor the Democrats , 62 percent to 38 percent . " By a staff photographer Youths ' hand at lever // By a staff photographer Something new to rap ' about : the vote *Survey of 18-20 vote points to a bonanza for Democrats // In Alaska , too , the registration is providing more Democrats than Republicans , though most of the newly enfranchised 18-to-20-year-olds are registering as indepen -- dents . The signs of the Democatic Party being the main beneficiary of the new crop of voters , which will number about 11 million next year , are being noted elsewhere , too , by public officials who are close to the voting scene in their particular states . Thus in the Midwest , where statistical evidence is not available , Monitor reporters see the Democrats picking up strength from the young vote in Michigan , Ohio , Missouri , Illinois , Minnesota , and Arkansas Meaning explored What does this add up to ? 1 . In simplistic , black-and-white terms this trend could mean that in a close election next year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . But , as correspondent Jack Waugh asks in a report from New Mexico which cites an early , 2-to-1 Democratic advantage in 18-to-20-year-old registration , " Who knows how they will vote ? " It should be recalled that in 1968 a large number of McCarthy supporters  --  mainly youths  --  ended up by not voting at all for president , or- by- voting for Richard Nixon . A recent study of voting trends in Illinois has found that 37 percent of the McCarthy backers finally voted for Mr. Nixon and that most of the remainder " sat on their hands . " Therefore , it must be underscored again and again  --  which some early articles about the youth vote are failing to do  --  that these new , young Democrats will probably be very independent about their voting for president . Difficult choices ? Thus , it remains conceivable that there are certain Democratic presidential candidates that the young Democratic voters would find less palatable than Mr. Nixon . What would they do , for example , if Sen. Henry Jackson were the opposing condi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find Ed Muskie passionate enough about the war  --  or about domestic urgencies  --  to win their support ? 3 . One very direct impact of this flow of young people to the Democratic Patty will be on the upcoming Democratic primaries . A number of the reporters providing input into the survey indicate findings , from polls and interviews , which show the " liberal " tastes of the new , young voters Impact of attitudes These attitudes would , it seems , draw them to such candidates as George McGovern or John Lindsay , if he runs , more than to some of the others in the field . At the same time , these new voters might make it hard on Ed Muskie in any primary where the result is close . One interesting finding in the survey from New Hampshire : Registration officials there indicate that up to 40 percent of the 18-to-20-year-olds were registering as independents . There were no statistics available on how many were registering as Democrats and Republicans . Could it be possible that these new " independents " are liberals who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their options open right up to New Hampshire primary time ? and then , depending on where they think their vote will be most effective , cast a Republican ballot for McCloskey or a Democratic ballot for , say , McGovern or Lindsay ?
