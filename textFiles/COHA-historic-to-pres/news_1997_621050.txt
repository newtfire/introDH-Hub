ELVIS IS GOLDEN IN ' PLATINUM ' 3 STARS ELVIS PRESLEY Platinum : A Life in Music RCA , $69.98 . Lost in the relentless deconstruction of Elvis the icon is the man 's actual work . This four-CD collection peels back the curtain to provide a long , luxurious look at the quarter-century career of the biggest singing star of the rock ' n ' roll era . " Platinum , " shipped to stores Tuesday , is an answer of sorts to the phenomenal success of the Beatles ' three " Anthology " releases . Like them , this rarities-and-outtakes collection documents some of the lesser moments of a hugely successful recording entity , and some other moments that undeservedly fell through the cracks . Just as you would n't buy the Beatles ' " Anthologies " if you did n't already own " Sgt. Pepper " or " Revolver , " " Platinum " is intended as a companion piece to Elvis ' original hit recordings . As a historic archive , it digs admirably deep  --  of 100 tracks , less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to years of bootleg activity , RCA has made at least a cursory effort to portray the recording foibles of its most important and most closely guarded artist . Predictably , little of the pill-popping King 's well-documented Las Vegas shenanigans surface here . But the set does include plenty of less-than- ideal vocal takes , both in the studio and in concert , revealing a man with a talent that needed to be honed like any other . Memphis-bred Elvis began his career singing decidedly regional material ; his vaunted Sun sessions included covers of bluesman Arthur " Big Boy " Crudup 's " That 's All Right " and the oft-recorded Bill Monroe bluegrass standard " Blue Moon of Kentucky . " But Elvis ' singing style was a remarkable synthesis of country yodeling , greaser menace and urbane balladry that transcended genre . The collection begins with a heretofore unexamined recording of an amateur Elvis singing the tearjerker " I 'll Never Stand in Your Way , " a demo he apparently cut soon after his fabled first visit to Sun . Much of Disc One is prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of the mid- ' 50s . Versions of such signature tunes as " Heartbreak Hotel " and " I Want You , I Need You , I Love You " offer the slightest variations on the final takes , while the rolling Lloyd Price song " Lawdy , Miss Clawdy " finds the singer giggling just before the countdown and an engineer toying with the vocal echo . Some songs are presented in thrilling live versions . " Hound Dog , " for instance , is taken from Presley 's second appearance on Milton Berle 's TV show , which preced ed the singer 's more legendary Ed Sullivan tapings . Performed on the Sullivan show before it was released to the public , Elvis ' first live performance of " Love Me Tender " elicits gasps of approval from the audience . Plenty of curiosities are sprinkled throughout " Platinum , " like the " Bad Nauheim Medley , " a rare tape from Elvis ' Army stint in Germany , and a Vegas-era live performance of " An American Trilogy , " the King 's puffed-up paean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Battle Hymn of the Republic . " There 's also a basso profundo version of Dylan 's ' Blowin ' in the Wind , " delivered with apparent sincerity . All aspects of Elvis ' catalog are represented here  --  his lowdown bluesy streak ( " Reconsider Baby " ) , his gospel inclinations ( " Oh How I Love Jesus " ) , the schmaltz of his jumpsuit period ( Don McLean 's " And I Love You So , " a hit for Perry Como ) . As early as Disc Two , things start to get silly , much as they did in Elvis ' career . Still , it 's easy to hear that he clung to his talent even as his celebrity and lifestyle got the best of him . Frivolous pop does n't get much better than " Bossa Nova Baby " ; socially self-conscious pop does n't get much better than " In the Ghetto . " Near the tail end of the last disc , Presley , in his 40s , tries out a mediocre but prophetic version of " Pledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another Memphian , who died during a game of Russian roulette on New Year 's Eve 1954 , just as Elvis was beginning his career . A mere three months before his own demise , Presley sang an uncharacteristically reflective version of " My Way " that sounds remarkably prescient . Illuminating mo ments like these make " Platinum " a welcome addition to the flooded Presleyana marketplace . * James Sullivan EARTH , WIND &; FIRE COVERS THE ELEMENTS 4 STARS EARTH , WIND &; FIRE In the Name of Love Pyramid , $15.99 . The tinkling tones of the African thumb piano of Earth , Wind &; Fire founder Maurice White are largely absent from the band 's first studio album in four years . Other elements that made the soul-jazz fusion aggregation stand out like a diamond amid the tinsel of the disco era are still firmly in place , however . Crisp , rippling horn lines snake in and around silky , high-pitched harmonies over a tight rhythmic bottom supplied by bassist Verdine White and drummer Sonny Emory to create textures that bubble with buoyancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continues to direct its course in the studio . He remains the producer and principal songwriter , his lyrics filled with vaguely mystical optimism and his melodies with memorable hooks . And he splits lead vocals with falsetto specialist Philip Bailey and guitarist Sheldon Reynolds . Reynolds ' George Benson-like guitar solos are among the disc 's instrumental highlights , along with Morris Pleasure 's serpentine synthesizer lines . " In the Name of Love , " due in stores Tuesday , should generate more interest than a live album that appeared last year  --  if it can find a home on trend-conscious radio . Admittedly , White and company make few concessions to fashion , with the exception of a rap by Sir Bailey ( Philip 's son ) on " Revolution , " the album 's first single . Even without White 's trademark kalimba , the material has a timeless quality that places it on an artistic scale alongside EW &F's; work of two decades back  --  when the band managed to buck trends and rule the airwaves simultaneously . * Lee Hildebrand CRYSTAL WATERS TREADS LIGHTLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crystal Waters ' third album starts out with a neatly percussive , a cappella-like number that sounds like Neneh Cherry on hallucinogens . As computer-spliced voices overlap , toy keyboards chime and the propulsive rhythm works itself up to dizzying heights , the listener feels excited and hopeful that the former librarian-turned-pop diva has finally seen the light and grown out of her tired 120-beat-per-minute rut . No such luck . By the time " Love I Found " and " On My Mind " rudely jump out of the speakers , Waters is back in her aerobic disco world , singing about everlasting love and feeling all right , over the relentless reverberation of 1987-style dance beats . Of course , she 's still at the top of her game . With a voice as seductive as the night and the tight production of maestros Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis on her side , there 's not much room for error . Given the opportunity , however , Waters does not hesitate to ruin a good thing . She shamelessly slaughters Prince 's " Uptown " with an anemic cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media hustler Dennis Rodman to add his dubious rap skills to the otherwise safe " Just a Freak . " But compared with the one-dimensional texture of the rest of the self-titled album , these travesties could almost pass as highlights .  --  Aidin Vaziri ' 187 ' SOUNDTRACK MORE OF THE SAME 2 STARS VARIOUS ARTISTS " 187 " : Music From the Motion Picture Atlantic , $16.98 . Once upon a time , someone had the bright idea that the dark , mysterious vibes of trip-hop would provide a suitable soundtrack for the dark , mysterious vibes of the movie crime thriller . It was smart thinking : The movie benefited from the trendy sounds , the once-obscure musicians gained a new , widespread audience , and the record company sold a truckload of CDs . In fact , the idea worked brilliantly the first 1,432 times . But surely , music and movie fans must be feeling a bit disgruntled after having to sit through the same " Massive Attack " track that has already appeared on at least 17 similar collections . The usual suspects appear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything But the Girl , a Prodigy- bolstered Method Man and the bronze medal-holder of the genre , DJ Shadow . There are a slew of new contenders who also make the cut , all ominous and anonymous . Saddest of all , a group masquerading under the name Bang Bang is not the ' 80s hair-metal outfit of the same moniker , but a new entity that contributes a song called " Neither Sing Sing Nor Baden Baden , " which is about as riveting as watching grass grow . * Aidin Vaziri POP CDs IN BRIEF 3 STARS LINCOLN , Lincoln , London , $15.98 They Might Be Giants , Ween , Barenaked Ladies  --  all are quirky pop groups that know how to wrap their irreverence in irresistible songs . Now add Lincoln to that list . With chiming guitars , ringing electric piano and tra-la-la effect , the dozen songs on " Lincoln " go down deceptively easily , engaging both ears and intellect . Neil Young would be proud of the free-spirit paean " Blow , " and " Stop " has the makings of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells a lost love that " Even though I dis ' you/ I still want to kiss you/ I love you and I miss you/ And I wish that you were dead , " you know exactly what he 's talking about . * Gary Graff3 STARS <p> MAHMOUD FADL , The Drummers of the Nile , Piranha , $ 16.98 <p> . <p> With this recording , director Mahmoud Fadl 's ensemble , Salamat , paints musical landscapes from the source of life . The regional dances and traditional rhythms lead us from Nubian bridal chambers to gatherings of men mimicking the gaits of camels and women singing on the banks of the Nile . Sometimes ferocious , sometimes gentle interweavings of djembe , tar , tabla , marakash , darabuka , oud , accordion , trumpet and voices announce ritual , romance and revolt . From scorching desert to the streets of Cairo , from struggle to celebration , this journey leads to that mother of all rivers . <p> * Sandy Miranda <p> 3 STARS <p> CLARENCE GATEMOUTH BROWN , Gate Swings , Verve , $ 15.98 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cut some distinguished sides for Duke Records in the ' 50s , seems right at home in this big-band swing sound . His brittle , snapping guitar lines easily cut through the fat , sassy brass applied to the selection of standards from the songbooks of Ellington , Basie and others on this scintillating , finger-snapping set . <p> * Joel Selvin <p> 3 STARS <p> LAUREN CHRISTY , Breed , Mercury Records , $ 11.98 <p> . <p> Lauren Christy comes off on the title track on " Breed " ( " I got soil , I got seed/ I got 21 God damned days until I bleed " ) like the reproduction- crazed alien in " Species , " but with wit . Still , you ca n't help but think of Alanis Morissette after hearing " Breed , " in stores Tuesday , because there are strong parallels . Both are angry young women who once recorded soft , commercial music , and are now , with the help of male co- writers and producers , coming out with harder-edged , biting stuff .
