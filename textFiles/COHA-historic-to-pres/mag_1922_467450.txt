THEY were building yesterday a preposterous , small rustic bridge over what is little more than a drainage ditch , though the gardener has planted it with the wild purple iris and set a Devoniensis rose to clambering over the lattice that runs along one side , so that it is very pretty . The bridge is about four feet long and is really a quite absurd engineering operation , since even in the most tropical of Floridian rain ? storms it spans a torrent only about four inches deep . We had , however , talked of it for days , and when the actual con ? struction work began there were three men engaged in it ? the gardener ; a carpenter of the village , highly skilled in " rustic work , " as the art is called ; and the black chauffeur . It was a moment in which my mother would have excelled , directing her cohorts with masterly generalship as she sat upon the patch of lawn near by in a small wicker-seated rocking chair which was set up , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tural forces for weeding or planting seeds , or for such great moments as this of bridge building ; indeed , the spanning of the Hellespont would be no more important in Asia Minor than is the conquering of this shallow ditch in our garden . But , alas ! for the third spring now the garden is without a general . This is why it gave me an odd turn yesterday when , coming along between the orange trees to observe the great event , I discovered that the small wicker-seated rocking chair , the gen ? eral 's seat , had been placed upon the patch of lawn near by , though she is no longer here to sit there . Neither the gardener nor / said any ? thing to each other about the " rocker . " We understood , and there are certain things one does not talk about , especially if there are others by . I think he be ? lieves , in some way of his own , in her actual presence there . I believe less surely , and at any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and for my sister , too , the small green back yard is a haunted place . We all know about the rocking chair . When it rains , whatever may happen to the other garden furniture , this must be brought to shelter . Every night it , at least , must sleep in the wood ? shed . If it is ever forgotten we apologize to each other , though we do it in a businesslike way as if we must n't be too sentimental about things . We were , as children , brought up in an atmosphere of gardens . But per ? haps if I am to be honest and accurate I should say back yards . Northern Ohio nearly half a century ago did not talk much of gardens , unless it meant vegetable patches . There was no gar ? dener employed regularly to embellish our back yard , no cohorts for mother to direct . There was John Eck , who came , if we could induce him to live up to his contract , once a week to mow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredible incompetence in such matters , and his son had inherited this quality . Yet because my mother had given me at my birth a small share of her passionate love of flowers I at ? tempted , most ineptly , indeed ( and my sister , in due time , as she stopped being a baby ) , to add some horticultural charms to the long , narrow yard with its nubby and infertile soil . My mother , though she was younger then , was never physically strong . We were her cohorts of that day , but , with us only , she could accomplish nothing like that later Flo ? ridian beauty . A bed of ground in a sheltered corner facing south between the kitchen and the dining room was in earliest child ? hood my domain ; as my sister grew up to a small spade and rake and trowel , I ceded a part to her , the less favorably exposed and less desirable portion , be it said at once , as befitted one younger and a female . The only permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a border of pink clove pinks which had been transported in my tenderest childhood ? and theirs ? from my grandmother 's garden in the coun ? try . My gardening lacked both dash and industriousness . It was done in a way so unimaginative and cowardly as to be in itself a confession of failure . I saved my pocket money as spring ap ? proached , and begged for a special floricultural grant from the parent al authorities , and then purchased , with a lavishness which varied with the sum so accumulated , potted plants at the greenhouse , and set them out in my plot . I had no nonsense with seeds and cold frames and transplanting ; I just turned the plants out of their pots , finding the balls of earth with their roots in a matted mass a very agreeable sight , and , lol my garden was . I was indeed a rank amateur . John Eck himself had a greenhouse , of lower prices than the one kept by a crabbed and frightening old fellow named Fehn , who , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not defend my gardening methods ; they would be frowned on by all modern educational authorities . But I will say that the spring spending at the green ? houses , artfully dividing my money be ? tween Eck and Feint , trying to get the best plants and yet hold the favor of each of them , was a very thrilling time . It might have been foundation train-big had I ultimately embraced either a commercial or a diplomatic career . As time went on our ambitions flew higher . Mother had secured a cata ? logue of a nursery near Philadelphia , and we attempted rose culture with named new varieties ? I must insist that this was not a commonplace thing , as it is now ; it was , for northern Ohio , novel , almost adventurous . The roses were miserable little bush6 and never throve very well . But I came to know La France and General Jacqueminot , which I pronounced in four syllables ? Ja-quim-i-no , and somehow the horizon broadened and glimpses of a world out ? side the Western Reserve were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French words , even as I guessed at their pronun ? ciation , gave a sense of personal dis ? tinction , of being , if not a man , at least a gardener of the world . There was in the catalogue a freakish and mysterious " green rose " given as a prize when one bought twenty others . I insisted upon this . Its arrival was a feverish moment . It was not a rose in the proper sense at all ; its flower was a mass of stiffish green leaves that were not of the texture of petals . It was ( after all these years one may be honest ) singularly ugly , its only virtue being an odd , spicy odor which it exhaled . But we proudly made much of it and showed it to visitors as a rare exotic which we occasionally imposed upon the softer-natured as an object of admiration . There is philosophy to he distilled here , I feel , but I prefer to go straight on to the more disillusioned and cynical view of life which came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Japanese quince " with dark , brilliant-red flowers set thickly along a brown branch , but I do not mean that . My father , as suited a grown-up man , had a broader vision of the back yard . He saw it as an orchard , and in an expansive moment he ordered little fruit trees which lie left to mother to have planted out . There were cherry , apple , peach , and one quince , and we made two rows of them . They all did very badly except the quince , which was a most intrepid tree , flowered prodigiously every spring , and almost broke in the autumn under the weight of its hard yellow fruit . But the thing which gave one the gravest doubts of the wisdom of Providence and of its kindliness was that we all longed for cherries , peaches , and apples , while none of us could " abide " quinces . Yet quinces were what fortune showered on us . The questions here raised have never been answered to my satisfaction to this day . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensations when a cousin named Mary Bentley came to live for a time with us , and we children discovered that it was quince seeds put to soak in water in a saucer which produced the mucilaginous balm which enabled Cousin Mary to paste her hair down in marvelous parallel " waves , " as they were called , and to adorn her smooth white temples with the flat , almost imperishable , locks of hair , like hooks , which were so agreeably termed " beau catchers " then . Cer ? tainly there was a beau caught and ulti ? mately married , and I had a momen ? tary vision of the possible place of the quince in the scheme of creation . But so much wisdom was almost oppressive to a child so young . Part of the masculine " wider vision " for the back yard was its availability for producing food supplies . At my father 's request offers to buy fresh veg ? etables were made me by the kitchen , and every year in a remoter and even more infertile part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually heaped them so high that they looked painfully like graves , which indeed they were ? of hopes . For by some strange fatality radish culture seemed my only success , and that root or tuber , or whatever it may be , produced such a general indi ? gestion in the family that the whole question of the advisability of vegetable raising remained unsolved . In this mat ? ter my mother remained serenelynoncommittal , but somehow one felt that her doctrine was being driven home , that the service of pure beauty as repre ? sented by flowers was even more valu ? able than that of utility , which radishes stood for . Perhaps there is no need to linger in that back-yard garden , al ? though I long at least to celebrate the admirable stove and oven combined which I used to build of brick , and in which the boys of the neighborhood roasted potatoes and occasionally the succulent and saucy English sparrow laid low by a sling shot . ( I was glad to recognize this bird years later in an ex ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing in the history of one 's coun ? try is too trivial to be worth setting down somewhere . Particularly in Amer ? ica , where civilization ? at least so called is forever slowly spreading over the whole land , are all kinds of minor dates in danger of being lost . When did olives arrive in northern Ohio and when did we stop dressing lettuce and tomatoes with sugar and vinegar ? Have we all stopped ? Such matters , if I could remember them accurately enough , I would brazenly set down , believing them of some importance some day to some one . A history of the progress of domestic decoration and taste should be written by some one . And bad taste is as signifi ? cant ? and perhaps as important histor ? ically ? as good . My mother , as her mother before her , and as , in fact , most American women ( not always their hus ? bands ) , stood eagerly waiting for the novelties in art as they slid down the western slope of the Alleghanies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we did possess a Chianti bottle painted with iridescent colors and adorned with a blue how . I can remember , through seeing my mother engaged in the enterprises , first of all " air castles " constructed of per ? forated cardboard and heads , then a strange rough hempen lace called , I seem to remember , macrame , though I doubt whether there is such a word in French . Then rickrack , was n't it a braid ? And repouss ? brass ? there was a panel of iris framed in red plush which for a considerable period adorned the parlor . And in an interlude what I seem to have called " scratchella " paint ? ing done on velvet with a skewer . And in due time " Kensington embroidery and cat-tails in a Japanese jar , the far wash of aesthetic London . Every Amer ? ican family has such an art history , certainly in the Middle West . It is comic , but I like it . I think it gay and gallant , too . And through it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were making their way to a true love of beauty in which , give them time . they will be excelled by no women in the world . My father died when I was seventeen . My mother lived on till I was approach ? ing what had been my father 's age . I have never married , and in the years that went by my relationship to my mother stands , among many happy re ? lationships , as the best . It is not always so in families , that I know . It would be arrogance to say of any friendship or relationship of one 's own that it was perfect . And I know that even for what share of perfection came to me I have no concrete , easily dis ? covered secret . I can perhaps , however , suggest a partial formulation of what family af ? fection should afford one . The world is a gay , diversified place of contending interests . Happiness is to come home to some one ( or to more than one ) for whom you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish for you anything but success and happiness . Here is something steadfast in the shift ? ing phantasmagoria of the world , Gib ? raltar firmly set among the treacherous currents of life 's tides . There could never have been in my mother 's mind any conflict between her children 's happiness and her own ; they were to her one and the same thing . It was not that she in the least sacrificedhers to us or we ours to her . Happiness was merely the unconscious adjustment of our varying interests ; the balance had already been struck before she her ? self had ventured to formulate her own demand for happiness . I speak of her only ; I would not claim this for us . It is always pleasant to me to think of my mother and it feeds my pride to believe that many of her qual ! ti-s were typical of the America in which she mostly lived and of the American women of that day . Her great sense of personal elegance in her clothes endears a whole century to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressions of and travel in America written during that so little remembered first half of the nineteenth century will find that however horrid and crude our visitors found the country , and partic ? ularly its male inhabitants , they had to admit that the ladies were beautifully dressed . Unsuitably , perhaps , the crit ? ics sometimes maintained . They could not understand how in the vulgar pub ? licity of the hotel ladies ' parlor females of refinement should choose to appear nightly in the latest and loveliest toi ? lettes from Paris . But why , we may well ask , should the American ladies of that day or any other wait for the country to grow up to their frocks ? I think it one of the finest of our national traditions , and I boast that when my mother went away to school she had the prettiest dresses of any girl there . Nothing , indeed , could have been more firmly founded in my mother 's mind than the duty of every woman to look her best . And when anything is a duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as children it was interesting , a historical subject worth study , what mother had worn as a child . I remem ? ber what a piquant paradox it seemed that she had never been permitted to have a high-necked dress until she was grown up . There are some extremely pleasant pictures of the little Adelaide with the childish gown demurely low over the shoulders . It is amazing of how remote a world such photographs already seem . Would a portrait of a Elizabethan child or of a small Roman of Caesar 's day seem really any more old-fashioned ? Less than a half century will produce the same effect of immemorial antiquity . As I write there comes into my mind a picture of my mother taken when I was a child ? and this , I must protest , is not quite immemorial antiquity . She is in a marvelous dress of black silk ( I hope it would " stand alone " ) with a neat , tight-fitting bodice and a great , beauti ? fully bouffant skirt of great puffs and cascades and Heaven knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , and curls and ringlets , and she stands in a pose of incomparable elegance by a proudly isolated " pedestal " crowned by what would seem a gas jet in a lovely globe . This is perhaps forty years ago , yet if I did n't know her and you asked me to believe that she was , say , the Empress of the Brazils in the eighteenth century , I should . If the ladies of our nation are elegant , are they not as traditionally good as they are beautiful ? Is that not our special national blend ? There is a glass box with a curved glass top within which lies a lovely nosegay of cloth flowers , which was used to contain the childish treasures of the little Adelaide . There was chiefest of all a tiny glass mandarin duck in an attached black-glass boat-like support which enabled it to float majestically upon , say , a goldfish bowl . This was extravagantly admired by the little Adelaide 's children ; it still is . What should perhaps have been more admired were the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Addle , for being a good girl . " These were usually just small cards , shiny and of an obvious elegance of quality , on which were painted little knots and garlands of bright flowers , the inscription written very small with a pen which traced a line of hairlike fineness . If my mother was good ? and indeed I believe she was ? she appeared to be quite unconscious of it . It was merely what a woman naturally would he ? it was like being well dressed . I do not remember that she ever exactly taught or tried to teach her children to be good ; she seemed merely to assume that of course they would be . Immorality , in all its varieties , there undoubtedly is in the world ? my mother would have gone quite that far in ad ? mitting the existence of evil . As she grew up ? or perhaps rather as her son did , she came into contact at times with a varied world , that of the theater , for example , and the arts generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met sometimes had not quite the standards of the northern Ohio where she won the school prizes for being a good girl . She was very friendly with them , very undeceived by them , very understanding , very forgiving . That was the way they were , and perhaps they could not help it ; and they had other excellent qualities and charm and gayety and many things which go to make life agreeable . She was indeed glad to see them when they wanted to see her . But her relationship to them all seemed also comic to her . If a fa ? mous lovely actress now living with her fourth husband rushed up and kissed her under the arc lights of Broadway as the theater crowd struggled for car ? riages , she was pleased enough , but she was apt to remark , as we drove away , that it was possibly an unusual thing to happen to a daughter of Solon . ( This was the northern Ohio village where my great-grandfather had settled when he went west from Connecticut . ) It was pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not necessary to emphasize the fact that your own standards remained quite unchanged . Is this not just the way American women have gone through the life of different worlds and continents , more especially Europe , quite understanding and often sympathizing , but , to the despair and bewilderment of foreigners , keeping their original standards quite intact ? Marriage , whatever strange and comic things other people and these newer generations might make of it , was for her a decorous and happy relationship . I never heard my father and mother quarrel . I was to be assumed that it had been a love match , though this would not perhaps be just the thing one would tell young children about . Is this not America , too ? We saw father and mother often enough with other men and women in the simple neigh ? borhood society of those days , in Cleve ? land , at card parties and informal " droppings in " of an evening , and at occasional dances . But I never saw an instant 's flirtatiousness on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world leads me to believe there was any such ; it was not then dans les maurs in northern Ohio . To a childish mind it seemed so certain the affection of our parents could have no ending that it seemed as if it could have had no beginning . In the sense , at least , that the most startling discovery of my early childhood was that my father had been married before . I learned this by accident , I forget how , and that he had loved his first wife , who was , it appeared , a sweet young creature who had died early in their married life . It is odd , perhaps , that I never spoke to him of all this . It was not that I approved or disapproved ; it was merely that my new knowledge made my father a mysterious , almost romantic , figure . It gave me a feeling that grown-ups had indeed lived as children certainly had not . It inspired me in the end with the courage to ask my mother who was the original of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she told me at once , with great simplicity , that it was the man she had been engaged to and that he had been killed during the war . Indeed , that was almost all she ever told me to theend of her life , though of course I grad ? ually came to learn a little more . I realized that his sisters were called my aunts and his nephews and nieces my cousins . And to-day they all feel that it is only by the sad chance of war that this is not our relationship ? though they all loved my " truly " father . There was an enchanting Aunt Mary whose visits pleasantly punctuated all my childhood . She had been a great beauty , and I imagine a great flirt , when she was younger . But a disappointment had come and she had never married , and she was growing old in a kind of gay , lovely tenderness which seems to me , as I look back , to have so often been the way with what we called " old maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a mys ? terious lady from Cincinnati with her daughter . They seemed to be old friends of my mother 's , though she had not seen them since the daughter was a little girl . Then I learned from them that when Augustus W ? had been wounded and was brought from the hos ? pital to Mrs. 0 ? ' s house in the old part of Cincinnati , to grow well , my mother came down from the northern part of the state to be with him till he recovered . He died , instead , and I think perhaps he was always the ro ? mance of my mother 's life . I learned only the other day for what a long time she wore mourning for Augustus And after she died my sister showed me a silk scarf faded to magenta , part of a uniform , which had always been among my mother 's treasures . We sent it to his family , but was it , after an , more theirs than ours ? There are more than blood kinships . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some letters of his , urging marriage , in which he so completely understood . I still know very little . There is a packet of Augustus 's letters , tied , as all such packets should be , with narrow blue ribbon . We have never read them . I think perhaps we never shall , though they will he treasured
