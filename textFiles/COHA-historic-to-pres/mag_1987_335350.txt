One of the great things about opera is that any boy can grow up to be Mephistopheles , even if he is the son of a meatcutter from Colby , Kans . One of opera 's problems is that it is still necessary for a performer to win a % European reputation before he can impress a major American company . For proof of these maxims , consider Samuel Ramey . <P> In his repertoire of classic , bel canto and romantic bass roles , Ramey , 45 , is without peer . He is a seductive Don Giovanni and a boisterous Leporello in Mozart 's Don Giovanni , a poignant Don Quixote in Massenet 's Don Quichotte and a terrifying barbarian chief in Verdi 's Attila . This month he is in Italy for appearances at La Scala in his favorite role , the sexy Figaro in Mozart 's The Marriage of Figaro . <P> Ramey 's silken voice , which ranges high into traditional baritone territory , is worlds apart from the toneless barking and roaring that too often pass for singing among basses . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rossini coloratura passages or rattle the rafters in triumph . <P> At 6 ft. and 175 lbs. , the sandy-haired , blue-eyed Ramey cuts a commanding figure onstage . Although shy in private life , he is physically fearless in front of an audience ; the burst of acrobatic twisting , leaping and rolling with which Ramey depicts the devil 's discomfiture at the end of Arrigo Boito 's Mefistofele is one of the most breathtaking spectacles in contemporary opera performance . European companies clamor for his services ; two summers ago , the Paris Opera staged a vivid production of Giacomo Meyerbeer 's 19th century spectral curiosity , Robert le Diable , just for him . <P> In America , though , Ramey is only now getting full recognition . Like Beverly Sills , Ramey first came to prominence at the New York City Opera , where he zoomed to starring roles . And like Sills , he was long snubbed by the Metropolitan Opera , finally cracking the Met for a 1984 staging of Handel 's Rinaldo . Ramey had little better luck at the country 's other two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Unlike Sills , he turned to Europe  --  to Covent Garden , La Scala and the Vienna State Opera . But what a difference a decade makes : last September , his towering presence energized a Figaro in San Francisco ; next season he is tapped for Faust and Figaro in Chicago . Even the Met has come around . This season audiences hailed his performances as Giorgio in Bellini 's I Puritani and Escamillo in Carmen ; he will sing both the Don and Leporello in 1989-90 . <P> Not bad for someone who never even saw an opera until he was in one . Ramey 's first exposure to music was at home and in church . " By the time I was nine or ten , I knew my voice was different from everyone else 's , " the erstwhile boy soprano recalls . " My voice already had vibrato , and I stifled it when I sang solos . I did n't want to be made fun of . " At that time his taste ran more to Pat Boone than to Robert Merrill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a foreign sound . "
