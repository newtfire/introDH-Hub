A detachment of French troops bivouacked on the edge of the forest of Covelleda.  --  A sentinel is seen on the cliffs overhanging the camp .  --  The guard is relieved in dumb-show as the dialogue progresses .  --  Louvois and Laboissire , wrapped in great-coats , are seated by a smouldering fire of brushwood in the foreground .  --  Starlight . Scene I. LOUVOIS , LABOISSIRE . Laboissire . Laboissire . Louvois ! Louvois , Louvois , Eh ? What is it ? I must have slept . Laboissire . Lab oissire . With eyes staring at nothing , like an Egyptian idol ! This is not amusing . You are as gloomy to-night as an undertaker out of employment . Louvois . Lo uvois . Say , rather , an executioner who loathes his trade . No , I was not asleep . I can not sleep with this business on my conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience goes to the rear  --  with the sick and wounded . Louvois . Louvo is . One may be forgiven , or can forgive himself , many a cruel thing done in the heat of battle ; but to steal upon a defenseless village , and in cold blood sabre old men , women , and children  --  that revolts me . Laboissire . Labois sire . What must be , must be . Louvois . Louvois . Yes  --  the poor wretches . Laboissire . Laboissire . The orders are  --  Louvois . Louvois . Every soul ! Laboissire . Labo issire . They have brought it upon themselves , if that comforts them . Every defile in these infernal mountains bristles with carabines ; every village gives shelter or warning to the guerrillas . The army is being decimated by assassination . It is the same ghastly story throughout Castile and Estremadura . After we have taken a town we lose more men than it cost us to storm it . I would rather look into the throat of a battery at forty paces than attempt to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You go in at one end , but , diantre ! you do n't come out at the other . Louvois . Louvois . What would you have ? It is life or death with these people . Laboissire . Laboissire . I would have them fight like Christians . Poisoning water-courses is not fighting , and assassination is not war . Some such blow as we are about to strike is the sort of rude surgery the case demands . Louvois . Louvo is . Certainly the French army on the Peninsula is in a desperate strait . The men are worn out contending against shadows , and disheartened by victories that prove more disastrous than defeats in other lands . Laboissire . Lab oissire . It is the devil 's own country . The very birds here have no song . Footnote : 1kb Even the cigars are damnable . Will you have one ? Louvois . Louvois . Thanks , no . Laboissire , Laboissire , This village of Arguano which we are to discipline , as the brave Junot would say , is it much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant hamlet  --  one wide calle with a zigzag line of stucco houses on each side ; a posada , and a forlorn chapel standing like an overgrown tombstone in the middle of the cemetery . In the market-place , three withered olive trees . On a hilltop overlooking all , a windmill of the time of Don Quixote . In brief , the regulation Spanish village . Laboissire . L aboissire . You have been there , then ? with your three withered olive trees ! Louvois , Louvois , Yes . I have been there . ... Laboissire , Laboissire , He has that same odd look in his eyes which has puzzled me these two days . ( Aloud . ) If I have touched a wrong chord , pardon ! You have unpleasant associations with the place . Louvois . Louvois . I ? O , no : on the contrary I have none but agreeable memories of Arguano . I was quartered there , or , rather , in the neighborhood , for several weeks a year or two ago . I was recovering from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley did me better service than a platoon of surgeons . Then the villagers were simple , honest folk  --  for Spaniards . Indeed , they were kindly folk . I remember the old padre , he was not half a bad fellow , though I have no love for the long-gowns . With his scant black soutane , and his thin white hair brushed behind his ears under a skull-cap , he somehow reminded me of my old mother in Languedoc , and we were good comrades . We used now and then to empty a bottle of Valdepeas together in the shady posada garden . The native wine here , when you get it pure , betters expectation . Laboissire . Laboissire . Why , that was consorting with the enemy ! The Church is our deadliest foe now . Since the bull of Pius VII. , excommunicating the Emperor , we all are heretical dogs in Spanish eyes . His Holiness has made murder a shortcut to heaven .

If the marchal had only turned over to me some other village ! No  --  I do not mean what I say . Since the work was to be done , it was better I should do it . There 's a fatality in sending me to Arguano . Remember that . From the moment the order came from headquarters I have had such a heaviness here . ( Pauses . ) Awhile ago , in a half doze , I dreamed of cutting down this harmless old priest who had come to me to beg mercy for the women and children . I cut him across the face , Laboissire ! I saw him still smiling , with his lip slashed in two . The irony of it ! When I think of that smile I am tempted to break my sword over my knee , and throw myself into the ravine yonder .

( Aloud . ) Bah ! it was only a dream , voil tout  --  one of those villainous nightmares which run wild over these hills . I have been kicked by them myself many a time . What , the devil ! dreams always go by contraries ; in which case you will have the satisfaction of being knocked on the head by the venerable padre  --  and so quits . It may come to that . Who knows ? We are surrounded by spies ; I would wager a week 's rations that Arguano is prepared for us . Louvois . Louvois . If I thought that ! An assault with resistance would cover all . Yes , yes  --  the spies . They must be aware of our destination and purpose . A movement such as this could not have been made unobserved . ( Abruptly . ) Laboissire ! Laboissire . Laboissire .

Come now , confess , my captain , it was the sobrina , and not the old priest , you struck down in your dream . Louvois . Louvois . Yes , that was it . How did you know ? labossire . Laboissire By instinct and observation . There is always a woman at the bottom of everything . You have only to go deep enough . Louvois . Louvois . This girl troubles me . I was ordered from Arguano without an instant 's warning  --  at midnight  --  between two breaths , as it were . Then communication with the place was cut off . ... I have never heard word of her since . Laboissire . Lab oissire . So ? Did you love her ? Louvois . Louvois . I have not said that . Laboissire . Labo issire . Speak your thought , and say it . I ever loved a love-story , when it ran as clear as a trout-brook and had the right heart-leaps in it . With this wind sighing in the tree-tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the very place and hour for a bit of romance . Come , now . Louvois . Louvois . It was all of a romance . Laboissire . Laboissire . I knew it ! I will begin for you : You loved her . Louvois . Louvois . Yes , I loved her ! It was the good God that sent her to my bedside . She nursed me day and night . She brought me back to life ... I know not how it happened ; the events have no sequence in my memory . I had been wounded ; I dropped from the saddle as we entered the village , and was carried for dead into one of the huts . Then the fever took me . ... Day after day I plunged from one black abyss into another , my wits quite gone . At odd intervals I was conscious of some one bending over me . Now it seemed to be a demon , and now a white-hooded sister of the Sacred Heart at Paris . Oftener it was that madonna above the altar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gunshot wounds ! One night I awoke in my senses , and there she sat , with her fathomless eyes fixed upon my face , like a statue of pity . You know those narrow , melting eyes these women have , with a dash of Arab fire in them . ... Laboissire . Laboissire . Know them ? Sacrebleu ! Louvois . Lou vois . The first time I walked out she led me by the hand , I was so very weak , like a little child learning to walk . It was spring , the skies were blue , the almonds were in blossom , the air was like wine . Great heaven ! how beautiful and fresh the world was , as if God had just made it ! From time to time I leaned upon her shoulder , not thinking of her . ... Later I came to know her  --  a saint in disguise , a peasant-girl with the instincts of a duchess ! Laboissire . L aboissire . They are always like that , saints and duchesses  --  by brevet ! I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  braids of purple-black hair and the complexion of a newly-minted napoleon ! I forget her name . ( Knitting his brows . ) Paquita ... Mariquita ? It was something-quita , but no matter . Louvois . Louvois . How it all comes back to me ! The wild footpaths in the haunted forest of Covelleda ; the broken Moorish water-tank , in the plaza , against which we leaned to watch the gypsy dances ; the worn stone-step of the cottage , where we sat of evenings with guitar and cigarette ! What simple things make a man forget that his grave lies in front of him ! ( Pauses . ) There was a lover , a contrabandista , or something  --  a fellow who might have played the spadassin in one of Lope de Vega 's cloak-and-dagger comedies . The gloom of the lad , fingering his stiletto-hilt ! Presently she sent him to the right-about , him and his scowls  --  the poor devil . Laboissire . Lab oissire . Oh , a very bad case ! Louvois . Louvois . I would not have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely . Louvois . Louvois . And there 's no human way to warn her of her danger ! Laboissire . La boissire . To warn her would be to warn the village  --  and defeat our end . However , no French messenger could reach the place alive . Louvois . Louvois . And no other is possible . Now you understand my misery . I am ready to go mad ! Laboissire . Laboi ssire . You take the thing too seriously . Nothing ever is so bad as it looks , except a Spanish ragot . After all , it is not likely that a single soul is left in Arguano . The very leaves of this dismal forest are lips that whisper of our movements . The villagers have doubtless made off with that fine store of grain and aguardiente we so sorely stand in need of , and a score or two of the brigands are probably lying in wait for us in some narrow caon . Louvois Louvois God will it so ! Laboissire . Labois sire . Louvois , if the girl is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be harmed , though I am shot for it when we get back to Burgos ! Louvois . Louvoi s . You are a brave soul , Laboissire ! Your words have lifted a weight from my bosom . Laboissire . Lab oissire . Are we not comrades , we who have fought side by side these six months and lain together night after night with this blue arch for our tent-roof ? Dismiss your anxiety . What is that Gascogne proverb ?  --  " We suffer most from the ills that never happen . " Let us get some rest ; we have had a rude day . ... See , the stars have doubled their pickets out there to the westward . Louvois . Louv ois . You are right ; we should sleep . We march at daybreak . Good-night . Laboissire . Laboissire . Good-night , and vive la France ! Louvois . Louvoi s . Vive l'Empreur ! Laboissire Laboissire " Reposez-vous , bons chevaliers ! " Louvois , Louvois , There goes a light heart . But mine ... mine is as heavy as lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While this is being sung behind the scenes the guard is relieved on the cliffs . Louvois wraps his cloak around him and falls into a troubled sleep . The camp is hushed ; the fires burn low ; Like ghosts the sentries come and go : Now seen , now lost , upon the height A keen drawn sabre glimmers white . Swiftly the midnight steals away  --  Reposez-vous , bons chevaliers ! Perchance into your dream shall come Visions of love or thoughts of home ; The furtive night wind , hurrying by , Shall kiss away the half-breathed sigh , And softly whispering , seem to say , Reposez-vous , bons chevaliers ! Through star-lit dusk and shimmering dew It is your lady comes to you ! Delphine , Lisette , Annette  --  who knows By what sweet wayward name she goes ? Wrapped in white arms till break of day , Reposez-vous , bons chevaliers ! ACT II .

Scene I. Mercedes , Padre Josf , then Ursula . Padre Josf . Mercedes ! daughter ! are you mad to linger so ? Mercedes . Mercedes . Nay , father , it is you who are mad to come back . Padre Josf . We were nearly a mile from the village when I missed you and the child . I had stopped at your cottage , and found no one . I thought you were with those who had started at sunrise . Mercedes . Mercedes . Nay , I brought Chiquita here last night when I heard the French were coming . Padre Josf . Quick , Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Merced es . Then hasten , Padre Josf , while there is yet time . ( Pushes him towards the door . ) Padre Josf . And you , child ? Mercedes . Merced es . I shall stay . Padre Josf . Listen to her , Sainted Virgin ! she will stay , and the French bloodhounds at our very heels ! Mercedes , Mercedes , Could I leave old Ursula , and she not able to lift foot ? Think you  --  my own flesh and blood ! Padre Josf . Ah , cielo ! true . They have forgotten her , the cowards ! and now it is too late . God willed it  --  santificado sea tu nombre ! ( Hesitates . ) Mercedes , Ursula is old  --  very old ; the better part of her is already dead . See how she laughs and mumbles to herself , and knows naught of what is passing . Mercedes . Merc edes . The poor grandmother ! she thinks it is a saint 's day . ( Seats herself on the settle . ) Padre Josf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is otherwhere ? What is a second more or less to the leaf that clings to a shrunken bough ? But you , Mercedes , the long summer smiles for such as you . Think of yourself , think of Chiquita . Come with me , child , come ! Ursula . Ursula . Ay , ay , go with the good padre , dear . There is dancing on the plaza . The gitanos are there , mayhap . I hear the music . I had ever an ear for tamborines and castanets . When I was a slip of a girl I used to foot it with the best in the cachuca and the bolera . I was a merry jade , Mercedes  --  a merry jade . Wear your broidered garters , dear . Mercedes . Mercede s . She hears music . ( Listens . ) No . Her mind wanders strangely to-day , now here , now there . The gray spirits are with her . ( To Ursula gently . ) No , grandmother , I came to stay with you , I and Chiquita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will murder you all . Mercedes . Mercedes . They will not have the heart to harm Chiquita , nor me , perchance , for her sake . Padre Josf . They have no hearts , these Frenchmen . Ah , Mercedes , do you not know better than most that a Frenchman has no heart ? Mercedes , Mercedes , I know nothing . I shall stay . Is life so sweet to me ? Go , Padre Josf . What could save you if they found you here ? Not your priest 's gown . Padre Josf . You will follow , my daughter ? Mercedes . Mer cedes . No . Padre Josf . I beseech you ! Mercedes . Mercedes . No . Padre Josf . Then you are lost ! Mercedes . Mercede s . Nay , padrino , God is everywhere . Have you not yourself said it ? Lay your hands for a moment on my head , as you used to do when I was a little child , and go  --  go ! Padre Josf . Thou wert ever a willful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say not so ; but quick  --  your blessing , quick ! Padre Josf . Dios . ... He makes the sign of the cross on Mercedes ' forehead , and slowly turns away . Mercedes rises , follows him to the door , and looks after him with tears in her eyes . Then she returns to the middle of the room , and sits on a low stool beside the cradle . Scene II . Mercedes , Ursula . Ursula , Ursula , Has he gone , the good padre ? Mercedes . Merced es . Yes , dear soul . Ursula , Ursula , He was your uncle once . Mercedes . Mercede s . Once ? Yes , and always . How you speak ! Ursula . Ursula . He is not gay any more , the good padre . He is getting old ... getting old . Mercedes . Mercedes . To hear her ! and she eighty years last San Miguel 's day ! Ursula . Ursula . What day is it ? Mercedes , Mercedes , Hist ! Chiquita is waking . Ursula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in spite of all . Hist ? God save us ! who taught thee to say hist to thy elders ? Ay , ay , who taught thee ? ... What day is it ? Mercedes , Mercedes , How sharp she is awhiles ! ( Aloud . ) Pardon , pardon ! Here is little Chiquita , with both eyes wide open , to help me beg thy forgiveness . ( Takes up the child . ) See , she has a smile for grandmother ... Ah , no , little one , I have no milk for thee ; the trouble has taken it all . Nay , cry not , dainty , or that will break my heart . Ursula . Ursula . Sing to her , nieta . What is it you sing that always hushes her ? ' T is gone from me . Mercedes . Mercedes . I know not . Ursula . Ursula . Bethink thee . Mercedes . Mercede s . I can not . Ah  --  the rhyme of The Three Little White Teeth ? Ursula , Ursula , Ay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it opens her blue bright eye , Bright as the sea and blue as the sky ?  --  Chiquita ! Who has the smile that comes and goes Like sunshine over her mouth 's red rose ?  --  Muchachita ! What is the softest laughter heard , Gurgle of brook or trill of bird , Chiquita ? Nay , ' t is thy laughter makes the rill Hush its voice and the bird be still , Muchachita ! Ah , little flower-hand on my breast , How it soothes me and gives me rest ! Chiquita ! What is the sweetest sight I know ? Three little white teeth in a row , Three little white teeth in a row , Muchachita ! As Mercedes finishes the song a roll of drums is heard in the calle . At the first tap she starts and listens intently , then assumes a stolid air . The sound approaches the door and suddenly ceases . Scene III . Laboissire , Mercedes , then soldiers . Laboissire , Laboissire , A sergeant and two men to follow me ! ( Mutters . ) Curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole village . Not a drop of wine , and the bread burnt to a crisp  --  the sclrats ! ( Appears at the threshold . ) Hulloa ! what is this ? An old woman and a young one  --  an Andalusian by the arch of her instep and the length of her eyelashes ! ( In Spanish . ) Girl , what are you doing here ? Mercedes , Mercedes , Where should I be , monsieur ? Laboissire . Laboissire . You speak French ? Mercedes . Merce des . Caramba ! since you speak Spanish . Laboissire . Laboissire . It was out of politeness . But talk your own jargon  --  it is a language that turns to honey on the tongue of a pretty woman . ( Aside . ) It was my luck to unearth the only woman in the place ! The captain 's white blackbird has flown , bag and baggage , thank Heaven ! Poor Louvois , what a grim face he made over the empty nest ! ( Aloud . ) Your neighbors have gone . Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my grandmother , seor ; she is paralyzed . Laboissire . Laboissire . So ? You could not carry her off , and you remained ? Mercedes . Mer cedes . Precisely . Laboissire . Laboissire . That was like a brave girl . ( Touching his cap . ) I salute valor whenever I meet it . Why have all the villagers fled ? Mercedes . Mercedes . Did they wish to be massacred ? Laboissire , Laboissire , And you ? Mercedes . Mercedes . It would be too much glory for a hundred and eighty French soldiers to kill one poor peasant girl . And then to come so far ! Laboissire , Laboissire , She knows our very numbers , the fox ! How she shows her teeth ! Mercedes . Merced es . Besides , seor , one can die but once . Laboissire . Labo issire . That is often enough .  --  Why did your people waste the bread and wine ? Mercedes . Mercede s . That yours might neither eat the one nor drink the other . We do not store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not take away the provisions , so they destroyed them ? Mercedes , Mercedes , Nothing escapes you ! Laboissire . Laboi ssire . Is that your child ? Mercedes . Merced es . Yes , the hija is mine . Laboissire . Labo issire . Where is your husband  --  with the brigands yonder ? Mercedes . Merce des . My husband ? Laboissire . L aboissire . Your lover , then . Mercedes . Mercede s . I have no lover . My husband is dead . Laboissire . Laboissire . I think you are lying now . He 's a guerrilla . Mercedes . Me rcedes . If he were I should not deny it . What Spanish woman would rest her cheek upon the bosom that has not a carabine pressed against it this day ? It were better to be a soldier 's widow than a coward 's wife . Laboissire , Laboissire , The little demon ! But she is ravishing ! She would have upset St. Anthony , this one  --  if he had belonged to the Second Chasseurs ! What is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword through her body ; practically , I shall make love to her in ten minutes more , though her readiness to become a widow is not altogether pleasing ! ( Aloud . ) Here , sergeant , go report this matter to the captain . He is in the posada at the farther end of the square . Exit sergeant . Shouts of exultation and laughter are heard in the calle , and presently three or four soldiers enter earing several hams and a skin of wine . 1st Soldier . 1st Soldier . Voil , lieutenant ! Laboissire . Laboissire . Where did you get that ? 2d Soldier . 2d Soldier . In a cellar hard by , hidden under some rushes . 3d Soldier . 3d Soldier . There are five more skins of wire like this jolly fellow in his leather jacket . Pray order a division of the booty , my lieutenant , for we are as dry as herrings in a box . Laboissire .

Why was it not served like the rest , then ? Mercedes . Mercede s . They hid a few skins , thinking to come back for it when you were gone . An ill thing does not last forever . Laboissire . L aboissire . Open it , someone , and fetch me a glass . ( To Mercedes . ) You will drink this . Mercedes Mercedes coldly . When I am thirsty I drink . Laboissire . Lab oissire . Pardieu ! this time you shall drink because I am thirsty . Mercedes . Merc edes . As you will . ( Empties the glass . ) To the King ! Laboissire . Laboissire . That was an impudent toast .

Labois sire . Do you hear ? Mercedes . Mercede s . But Chiquita , seor  --  she is so little , only thirteen months old , and the wine is strong ! Laboissire . Laboissire . She shall drink . Mercedes . Merced es . No , no ! Laboissire . Labois sire . I have said it , sacr nom  --  Mercedes . Merced es . Give it me , then . ( Takes the glass and holds it to the child 's lips . ) Laboissire , Laboissire , Woman ! your hand trembles . Mercedes . Mer cedes . Nay , it is Chiquita swallows so fast .

One can not be too cautious in this hospitable country ! Fall to , my children ; but first a glass for your lieutenant . ( Drinks . ) Ursula . Ursula . Ay , ay , the young forget the old ... forget the old . Laboissire , Laboissire , Why , the depraved old sorceress ! But she has reason . She should have her share . Place aux dames ! A cup , somebody , for Madame la Diablesse ! Mercedes , Mercedes , Jos-Maria ! One of the men carries wine to Ursula . Mercedes lays the child in the cradle , and sits on the stool beside it , resting her forehead on her palms . Laboissire stretches himself on the settle . Several soldiers come in , and fill their canteens from the wine-skin . They stand in groups , talking in undertones among themselves . Laboissire Laboissire The child ! look at the child ! What is the matter with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are poisoned ! Mercedes Mercedes Yes , you are poisoned ! Al fuego  --  al fuego  --  todos al fuego !

Mercedes Mercedes Strike here , seor . ... Louvois Louvois Mercedes ! Laboissire . Laboissire . Louvois , we are dead men ! Beware of her , she is a fiend ! Kill her without a word ! The drink already throttles me  --  I  --  I can not breathe here . ( Staggers out , followed wildly by the soldiers . ) SCENE IV . LOUVOIS , MERCEDES . Louvois . Louvois . What does he say ? Mercedes . Mercedes . You heard him . Louvois . Louvois . His words have no sense . ( Advancing towards her . ) O , why are you in this place , Mercedes ? Mercedes , Mercedes , I am here , seor  --  Louvois . Louvo is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercedes . Mercede s . Because we Spaniards do not desert those who depend upon us . Louvois . Louvois . Is that a reproach ? Ah , cruel ! Have you forgotten  --  Mercedes . Mercedes . I have forgotten nothing . I have had cause to remember all . I remember , among the rest , that a certain wounded French officer was cared for in this village as if he had been one of our own people  --  and now he returns to massacre us . Louvois . Louvois . Mercedes ! Mercedes . Mercedes . I remember the morning , nearly two years ago , when Padre Josf brought me your letter . You had stolen away in the night  --  like a deserter ! Ah , that letter  --  how it pierced my heart , and yet bade me live ! Because it was full of those smooth oaths which women love , I carried it in my bosom for a twelvemonth ; then for another twelvemonth I carried it because I hoped to give it back to you . ( Takes a paper from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are ! ( Tears the paper into small pieces which she scatters at his feet . ) Louvois . Lou vois . Ah ! Mercedes . Merced es . Sometimes it comforted me to think that you were dead . You were only false ! Louvois . Louvois . It is you who have broken faith . I should be the last of men if I had deserted you . Why , even a dog has gratitude . How could I now look you in the face ? Mercedes . Mercede s . ' T was an ill day you first did so ! Louvois . Louvois . Listen to me ! Mercedes . Mercedes . Too many times I have listened . Nay , speak not ; I might believe you ! Louvois . Louvois . If I do not speak the truth , despise me ! Since I left Arguano I have been at Lisbon , Irun , Aranjuez , among the mountains  --  I know not where , but ever in some spot whence it was impossible to get you tidings . A wall of fire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my letters brought back to me  --  with the bearers ' blood upon them ; thrice I have trusted to messengers whose treachery I now discover . For a chance bit of worthless gold they broke the seals , and wrecked our lives ! Ah , Mercedes , when my silence troubled you , why did you not read the old letter again ? If the words you had of mine lost their value , it was because they were like those jewels in the padre 's story , which changed their color when the wearer proved unfaithful . Mercedes . M ercedes . Aquilles ! Louvois . L ouvois . Though I could not come to you nor send to you , I never dreamed I was forgotten . I used to say to myself : " A week , a month , a year  --  what does it matter ? That brown girl is as true as steel ! " I think I bore a charmed life in those days ; I grew to believe that neither sword nor bullet could touch me until I held you in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed upon her bosom and looks at him with a growing light in her eyes . ) It was the day before yesterday that our brigade returned to Burgos  --  at last ! at last ! O , love , my eyes were hungry for you ! Then that dreadful order came . Arguano had been to me what Mecca is to the Mohammedan  --  a shrine to be reached through toil and thirst and death . O , what a grim freak it was of fate , that I should lead a column against Arguano  --  my shrine , my Holy Land ! Mercedes moves swiftly across the room , and kneeling on the flag-stones near Louvois 's feet begins to pick up the fragments of the letter . He suddenly stoops and takes her by the wrists . Mercedes ! Mercedes . Mercedes . Ah , but I was so unhappy ! Was I unhappy ? I forget . ( Looks up in his face and laughs . ) It is so very long ago ! An instant of heaven would make one forget a century of hell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . It was not I , but some poor girl I used to know who was like to die for you . It was not I  --  I have never been anything but happy . Nay , I needs must weep a little for her , the days were so heavy to that poor girl . And when you go away again , as go you must  --  Louvois . Louvoi s . I shall take you with me , Mercedes . Do you understand ? You are to go with me to Burgos . ( Aside . ) What a blank look she wears ! She does not seem to understand . Mercedes , Mercedes , With you to Burgos ?

Misricorde ! are twenty  --  Sergeant . Ser geant . Hold your peace , all of you ! ( Advances and salutes Louvois , who is half kneeling beside the body of the woman . ) My captain !
