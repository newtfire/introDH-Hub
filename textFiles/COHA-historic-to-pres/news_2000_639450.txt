Eric Rimm , a nutritional epidemiologist , has a drink with dinner most nights of the week . <p> ' To me , it 's a part of a healthy lifestyle , ' said the Harvard School of Public Health associate professor , who has spent years studying the health effects of alcohol . <p> ' There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that moderate alcohol consumption lowers the risk of heart disease , ' he said . <p> For middle-aged people , he said , the benefit to the heart of moderate drinking - about a 25 percent drop in the risk of a heart attack - is equivalent to losing 30 pounds , exercising 30 minutes a day four times a week , or eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day . <p> Others are quick to point out the enormous social and medical costs of excessive drinking . But many alcohol experts agree that people who drink moderately - one drink a day for women and up to two drinks for men - have a lower risk of heart attacks , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moderate drinking seems to lessen the risk of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women . There is also some evidence that it reduces the chances of developing adult-onset diabetes . <p> No encouragement <p> Years of medical studies have made it clear that a glass of champagne could help many older revelers usher in a healthy new year . <p> But the growing body of evidence that there 's a positive side to demon rum has put doctors in a very uncomfortable spot . Studies showing that moderate drinking is good for you routinely contain a strongly worded caveat that this information should not be taken as encouragement to drink . <p> The problem , of course , is that alcohol is the classic double-edged sword . It might be good for you in small doses , but it 's really bad in large ones . About 14 million Americans are problem drinkers . The government estimates that 100,000 people each year die from alcohol-related causes . In large amounts it can damage the heart , liver , brain , bones and sex organs . It causes some kinds of cancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders , rapes and child abuse cases . <p> ' Unfortunately , ' said Charles Hennekens , a former Harvard researcher who was among the first to study alcohol and heart disease , ' the difference between drinking a small amount and a larger amount is the difference between preventing and causing premature death . ' <p> Thus , the question of what to do with this information . <p> ' The data are really quite clear , ' said Julie Buring , a Harvard Medical School professor and coauthor of the stroke study . ' The science is n't the problem . It 's the recommendation you make that 's the problem . ' <p> New rules opposed <p> New rules allowing wineries to backhandedly advertise the health benefits of their products are facing vocal opposition in Washington . Controversial federal dietary guidelines that included positive information about alcohol for the first time in 1995 are also undergoing a revision that 's being closely watched by anti-alcohol forces . <p> ' This is a dangerous product , ' said John DeCrosta , press secretary for Sen. Strom Thurmond , R-S.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' There are very serious health consequences to consuming alcohol . The public should be aware of that . ' <p> Many worry that heavy drinkers will use positive data on alcohol as an excuse to drink too much and that some nondrinkers will become alcoholics . <p> ' Once you tell someone a little bit is good , people tend to believe a lot is better , ' said Hilary Abramson , media specialist for the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other Drug Problems in California . She worries that positive publicity is leading some to think alcohol is ' some kind of health elixir . ' <p> Many doctors say their standard advice is that heavy drinkers should cut back and moderate drinkers need feel no guilt . <p> Not for everybody <p> ' Clearly , you should n't give the message that everyone should drink , ' said Rimm , who nonetheless believes doctors should suggest it to some people . Most agree that the benefits of alcohol apply only to those in middle age and up . <p> Obviously , people with a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors said . Anyone with hepatitis C should not drink , because the combination of that disease and alcohol appears to accelerate the liver problems associated with each . Some medications and alcohol do n't mix . Many doctors say pregnant women should not drink . <p> ' I absolutely would not recommend that a nondrinker begin to drink alcohol without consulting a health professional , ' Buring said . <p> While there are few dangers associated with moderate drinking , it can cause liver damage or heart rhythm problems in some people , and it 's a trigger for migraine headaches , doctors said . In a small study , Emma Meagher , an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania , found that as little as two drinks led to ' oxidant stress , ' damage that is associated with diabetes , heart , liver , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases . <p> Widely publicized research connecting moderate drinking and breast cancer has been controversial . Some doctors still believe it increases the risk somewhat . But Emanuel Rubin , chairman of the pathology , anatomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime alcohol researcher , said he has reviewed all the studies and found only a ' weak association ' between heavy drinking and breast cancer . There was no clear evidence that moderate drinking caused cancer , he said . <p> As for the benefits , researchers believe that alcohol protects the heart in two ways . It increases the level of HDL , or good cholesterol . And it reduces blood clotting . Clots can trigger a heart attack when they become trapped in narrowed vessels . <p> Despite much publicity to the contrary , most experts believe the type of drink is immaterial . It 's the ethyl alcohol in the drink that 's important . So the cheapest whiskey is as good for your heart , if not your palate , as the best red wine . <p> Some researchers contend that antioxidants in wine give it extra benefits , but this is much in dispute . The prevailing theory is that it is more than wine that makes wine drinkers look good in the studies . <p> ' The way wine is usually drunk , slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Klatsky , a longtime alcohol researcher at Kaiser-Permanente in California . Plus , in this country , wine drinkers tend to be better educated , wealthier , have healthier lifestyles , and smoke less than people who prefer alcohol in other forms , he said . <p> It does make a difference how you drink , though . The research points to light , consistent drinking . ' One drink a day does not equal seven drinks on Saturday night , ' Buring said . <p> According to Harvard 's Rimm , about 45 percent of American women and 30 percent of men do n't drink . Overall , he said , they would be better off drinking moderately . ' In terms of the health of society , we would all live longer if everybody who 's not drinking started drinking , ' he said . He pointed out , though , that what 's better for the group might be worse for the individual . Some people would become alcoholics and there would be more traffic accidents . <p> It 's harder than you would think to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach middle age in this country without having had plenty of opportunities to drink . If they 're not doing it , he said , they usually have a good reason . <p> Howard Miller , a Philadelphia internist , occasionally suggests that a non-drinking patient start for health reasons . ' It 's hard to get them to do it because it 's not part of their lifestyle , ' he said . <p> ' I 've yet to have somebody come back and say , ' Yes , I 'm drinking a glass of wine a day . " <p> For that and other reasons , R. Curtis Ellison , a professor of medicine and public health at Boston University School of Medicine , thinks the risk that good news about booze will cause a surge in alcoholism is ' greatly exaggerated . ' <p> ' I do n't think the American public is quite as dumb as we sometimes think , ' Ellison said . <p> Ellison , who receives 10 percent of his research funding from alcoholic beverage companies , thinks doctors should be giving all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disservice to your patients if you do not present the current information on moderate drinking and health outcomes , ' he said . <p> But Klatsky is more cautious . ' Only in very specific individual instances should an abstainer be told that he should drink , ' he said . <p> Miller said many doctors were trained to believe alcohol is ' horrible . ' They saw people with poisoned livers or in the throes of delirium tremens during alcohol withdrawal . Their fear of saying something good about liquor is ' palpable , ' he said . <p> ' It 's just been so taboo , ' he said . ' Everybody 's afraid of knowing where to draw the line . ' <p> Doctors point out that there are plenty of other ways to lower your risk of heart disease , and a glass of wine a day is not an excuse to wolf down a cheesesteak . Myriad drugs , including good old aspirin , are available , although few raise HDL . <p> William Levy , a Philadelphia area cardiologist , thinks patients can take many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' It really is n't the first-line agent , ' he said .
