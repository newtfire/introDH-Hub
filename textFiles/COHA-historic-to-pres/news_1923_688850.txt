Adrenalin will . restore the dead to life  --  with many reservations and in a limited number of cases . It is not a , cure-all , nor an elixir of life , nor a medicine for the black bag of the family doctor . It Is , however , a powerful heart stimulant that is invaluable In certain cases of collapse . Such was the opinion expressed yesterday by Dr. Lester H. Dragstedt , assistant professor of physiology in the University of Chicago , who , with his co-worker , Dr. Arno B. Luckhardt , has helped make adrenalin more than a medical novelty . Must lie Used Quickly . The usefulness of adrenalin lies chiefly in its effect of constricting the heart and blood vessels , thus causing a marked increase in blood pressure , the doctor declared . It is this virtue which has accomplished marvelous recoveries in certain cases and has brought persons seemingly dead to life by stimulating the heart into action . But here enter the reservations . The heart must not have stopped more than a few minutes ; ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become destroyed . , The heart must not be diseased or worn out . Other disease , sufficient in itself to cause death , must not be present . These conditions limit the cases where adrenalin may be used successfully . Only Few Cases Amenable . " The most common cases are those of heart stoppage due to over-anaesthetization or of shock due to wounds , " said Dr. Dragstedt . " It can not be over-emphasized that adrenalin will produce results only in a few special cases . People hearing of a few cures ask why it was not used in the case of so and so , who died ? They do not realize that many complex conditions must be fulfilled before its use can meet with success . " Adrenalin has been in use for several years . Discovery that a substance which would raise the blood pressure could be obtained from the adrenal glands was made in 1895 by twq English scientists , Oliver and Schaefer . The chemical itself was first isolated In 1903 by an American , Prof. John J. Able of Johns Hopkins university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthetically.
