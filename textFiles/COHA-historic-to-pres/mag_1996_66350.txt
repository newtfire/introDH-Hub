But an improved defense is at least as responsible as Favre for Green Bay 's 6-1 start . Here are perhaps the two most illuminating statistics about this year 's Packers defense : 1 ) Green Bay , which finished last in the NFL in takeaways last season with 16 , leads that category this year with 27 ( 20 interceptions and seven fumble recoveries ) ; and 2 ) the Pack is allowing opponents to complete only 46.7% of their passes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago ( chart ) . // The reversal in turnover fortunes is especially eye-popping . In winning the NFC Central last season , the Packers ' 16 takeaways  --  three fumble recoveries and 13 interceptions  --  was the lowest total since the league went to a 16-game schedule in 1978 . This year 's defensive unit , with three new starters , is on pace to force 62 turnovers , four short of the league record set by the San Diego Chargers in the old AFL , in 1961. // Here are a few of the reasons cited for Green Bay 's improved D. // ? Greater Team Speed : Coach Mike Holmgren credits new defensive tackle Santana Dotson , acquired as a free agent from the Bucs , with much of the defense 's improvement . Dotson gives the Pack a force up the middle to go with the heavy outside pressure from defensive ends Sean Jones and Reggie White . Many of Green Bay 's interceptions this year began as passes made under duress . Also , Brian Williams , a second-year Packer who looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has played well enough to allow George Koonce to move to middle linebacker , where he 's more effective . Koonce has three interceptions this season , two more than he made in his first four seasons combined . // ? Good Health : All 11 starters have played every game . // ? Better Hands : The savvy of safety Eugene Robinson , an 11-year veteran picked up in a trade with Seattle , has enabled strong safety Leroy Butler to play much more aggressively , and Butler leads the league in picks , with five . Early in training camp Robinson started catching passes fired at point-blank range from a pass-throwing machine , and his teammates soon joined him . Packers coaches say they have a film reel of 17 or 18 catchable interceptions that were n't caught a year ago . Now those drops are becoming interceptions. // ? Better Eyes : Cornerback Craig Newsome was fitted for contact lenses in August and liked what he was suddenly able to see . After dropping two interceptions in a preseason game , Butler visited Newsome 's optometrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turnover turnabout as his improved vision when he says , " It 's a whole different world .
