Dixie 's winding backroads take you to some of the prettiest high points in the country-and some of the bloodiest . Mississippi 's Woodall Mountain hosted a Civil War battle . Andrew Jackson 's campaign against the Seminoles raged around Florida 's high point , and Kentucky 's coal-rich Black Mountain was backdrop to violent labor disputes . High-pointing added its own chapter when Dr. Elisha Mitchell fell to his death trying to prove that the North Carolina peak that now bears his name was the state 's highest ( at least he was right ) . All this only adds intrigue to an already atmospheric tour that includes Texas 's jagged peaks . South Carolina 's forested slopes , and Tennessee 's stunning mountain vistas. // ( ProQuest Information and Learning : ... denotes obscured text omitted . ) BLACK MESA Oklahoma ELEVATION 4,973 feet RANK 23 SUMMIT Oklahoma 's hardscrabble panhandle is home to Black Mesa State Park , a delightfully weird world of extremes with an arid landscape of cactus , lava , and stunted junipers .

From the parking lot high above the Blue Ridge Parkway , it 's all of 285 yards to the bulky stone structure at the summit .
