Effects of Cigarette Smoking . Tc the Editor of The New York Times : " Smoking one cigarette reduces the number of bacteria removable by rinsing the mouth by about 40 per cent . Thirty minutes after smoking , this number is still 14 per cent below the initial number and 26 per cent below the corresponding number of the control group . " This is quoted from the summary of an article by J. L. T. Appleton Jr . and Earl Lehmer on " The Effect of Cigarette Smoking on the Number of Bacteria Removable in Mouth Rinsing , " in The Dental Cosmos of November , 1928 . However , cigarette smokers should not rejoice too soon . Excessive smoking is believed to be the chief cause of leukoplagia of the mouth  --  a preliminary lesion leading to oral cancer . Irritation is the factor to be considered . His dentist will tell " Scientist " what " trench mouth " is .

New York , May 16 , 1930 . . SAFETY ON HIGHWAYS . Measures Suggested to Curb Careless Automobile Drivers . To the Editor of The New York Times : Secretary Lamont , chairman of the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety , said : " It is high time that all of us ? public authorities , associated groups and individuals  --  should bring increasing reason to bear upon the problems of motor traffic . " The general rule was suggested that no driver should proceed at a speed so rapid that he could not stop under ordinary conditions in order to prevent a collision . That " increasing reason " must be brought to bear upon the problems of motor traffic is evident from the fact that probably 10 to 15 per cent of motor vehicle operators will not limit their speed to such a degree as to enable ' them to stop quickly enough to prevent a collision . Since this is generally understood , some means of compulsion must be used to force the careless operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedients , would , if adopted , prevent many accidents which now occur in motor traffic : 1 . At every curve on a motor highway where the roadway turns so sharply that Intervening objects obscure the view , let a concrete wall , a foot ' wide and six inches high , be built , so long that no motorist would dare take a chance of using the lefthand lane . 2 . Let oblong safety islands , bounded by six-inch lines painted white , with white iron bumpers at each end , such as are used in Los Angeles and other California cities to protect passengers who are waiting to board trolley cars , be installed at all principal crossings ; and other islands be painted in the middle of all crossings of one-way streets . 3 . Establish crossings twenty or twenty-five feet from the intersections of streets and mark the crossings with white dines. 4 . Let all turns against a red light be prohibited , as I believe has been suggested by THE NEW YORK TIMES . 5 . At all crossings where no red and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which shall be punched on by the pedestrian before crossing the street , and punched off after he has crossed . This use of the red light is being tried out in White Plains , N. Y. , and in other cities . 6 . Let all automobiles and trucks be of standard width and all highways be constructed approximately two and one-half or five times such width . Let each highway be divided into halves , each to be used for travel in only one direction . Let each half of said highway be so constructed that no passing could be done except at certain points about one-half to three-quarters of a mile apart , at which point each half of the highway would be of double width . The objection may be made that to carry out the above suggestions would entail a great expense , but if deaths caused by automobile accidents are to be materially reduced in number , it would appear that most of the above changes must be made . New York ; May 29 , 1930 . M. W. IS IT SO IMPORTANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attention . To the Editor of The New York Times : Perusing THE TIMES this morning , I found a rather lengthy report of what Representative Fort has to say about the illegality of home brew . I hold no brief for those worthy gentlemen who , like Mr. Fort , think that the best way to save the Republic is through the strictest observance of the spirit and the letter of the Eighteenth Amendment . . In fact , I think that they are very logical . If there must be prohibition , let it be real and effective . However , this is not what prompted me to write . ' I am one of the countless " new " Americans who are watching with rather mild interest the progress ( or is it the regress ? ) of the " noble experiment " which , in itself , strikes me  --  and I believe others like me ? as being not particularly important in the cosmic scheme of things and even in the plain , everyday American life . In other words , I think that the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At times I am tempted to ask myself whether I am dreaming or is it true that a great and powerful people of 120,000,000 souls does not have more important problems to solve than the enforcement of national prohibition . Is it possible that the mightiest nation on the face of the earth , as I see it , is still groping about trying to find a solution to a secondary problem , and in the effort of striving for that solution is consigning all other national and international problems to the limbo of forgetfulness ? Perhaps I look at prohibition with the detached curiosity of one who really is not interested in experiments of that sort ; but I think I may be permitted to believe that some of my fellow-Americans are really taking prohibition altogether too seriously . It is painful to see a. great nation and a great and brilliant people gifted with an unlimited sense of humor become impotent before such a secondary social problem . It is not for this that we became Americans . GIOVANNI BILLI . Brooklyn , May 29 , 1930 . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use is Considered . To thy Editor of The New York Times : The recent discussion in THE ' Trues ) f the relative merits of the St. Lawrence or the New York State Barge Canal as the route of a prorpective ship canal to the Great Lakes has seemed rather to overlook one important point , and that is whether such a canal across New York State would ever be used sufficiently to pay for the greater cost . Many people seem to think that if there is a ditch twenty-seven feet deep from Oswego to Albany , nicely filled with water , ships will be as much attracted to it as ducks . A ship canal is more than a ditch tilled with water ; it is an engineering device for the transportation of commodities , and unless it is practical not only from an engineering but From an economic point of view , it is as useless as the proverbial fifth wheel . Now it is certainly possible and practicable to build a ditch and fill it with water from Oswego to Albany , but it is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever utilize such a ditch , especially If there was a competing one along the St. Lawrence . The New York route would be in the neighborhood of 150 miles long ; all save-some 25 miles across Oneida Lake pf pure canal construction . The ditch would climb some 170 feet from Lake Ontario and would then descend some 400 feet to the Hudson at Albany . To do this some twenty locks would be required . The route traverses the very heart of New York State and would intersect many highways and railroads , for which fifty or more drawbridges would have to be provided . As a result the traverse of the canal would be tedious and dangerous for ships , and would cause serious delays to land traffic along one of the principal traffic arteries of the nation . The great length of canal construction would magnify the probability of slides or other technical defects or accidents which would tie up all traffic on the canal . No other ship canal in the world would have such a combination of length , lockage and bridges . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contrast , does the St. Lawrence present ? A restricted waterway from Lake Ontario to tidewater at Montreal of not more than twenty-five miles , one-sixth that of the-New York route . An the rest of the St. Lawrence route would be through the deep water of the natural river or through the deep lakes formed by the dams . There would be no more than nine locks . There would be only eight bridges . In length of restricted navigation , locks and bridges the St. Lawrence waterway would greatly resemble the Panama Canal . The cost of the St. Lawrence route for navigation alone would be about $200,000,000 as compared with $600 , - 000,000 or - more for the New York route , which would have no offset in power production and no sharing of the cost with Canada . Talk of deepening the Barge Canal to fourteen feet is another piece of folly . Such depth is needlessly deep for barge navigation and ludicrously shallow for ship navigation . The navigational depth of the Ohio and lower Mississippi is only nine feet , and these rivers carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twelve-foot depth . It is true that the present St. Lawrence canals around the rapids are fourteen feet and that they carry four or five times the tonnage of the Barge Canal , but this pre-eminence is due to their shorter length and to the superior facilities at Montreal for the handling of grain , which is the principal commodity carried by both canal systems . The opening this Summer of the new Welland Canal will enable lake freighters to continue their voyages to Ogdensburg or Prescott on the St. Lawrence . From there to Montreal even now there is only some forty-six miles of canal navigation . Is it reasonable to suppose they will stop to discharge their cargoes at Oswego for transport to the sea through 150 miles of canal even if the canal were fourteen feet deep ? The so-called patriotic argument for the New York route , which is essentially a military argument based on the fact that the St. Lawrence flows most of its course through Canadian territory , appeals of course to those who fail to remember that the Welland Canal , an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To duplicate the Welland on our side of the line would cost at least $100,000,000 , and such a canal would be subject to destruction in war by long-range artillery or by air attack . ERNEST S. CLOWES . Bridgehampton , N. Y. , May 26 , 1930 . Chicken Feed and Carpentry . To the Editor of The New York Times : Twenty-two years ago while remodeling a. barn here , paying carpenters $2.25 a day and selling eggs at 18 cents a dozen , I exchanged say thirteen dozen of hen fruit for each day 's work . Now having similar work performed here by the same organized conspirators , I 'm paying ' em $9.40 per eight-hour day and selling eggs at 24 cents per dozen  --  exchanging the equivalent of forty dozen for a shorter day 's work . And I 'd almost forgotten to say that it costs nearly 200 per cent more to make those eggs than formerly , thanks to the activities of the Farm Board , which is ' stabilizing Western grain prices with the help of my hard-earned tax money .

To the Editor of The New York Times : So Father Duffy feels that he is not wanted because he has been missed in the census ? He is not alone . There are more than a hundred future priests here who are wondering whether they count for anything . Some of us may have been enumerated in Oshkosh , Kalamazoo or Skowhegan , but there are many here whose families live in New York City and who were missed both there and here . I know of no one in my apartment house who succeeded in getting on the lists . But , then , I suppose the government will learn of our existence when it makes up the roll of those eligible for taxation . On the other hand , our meager salaries may forestall this .
