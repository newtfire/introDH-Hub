The House Ways &; Means Committee began last week to fool around tentatively with one of the major problems of the new session : what , if anything , to do about the renegotiation of war contracts . <P> In Principle . Almost no one objects to the principle of renegotiation , which is simply that no one should profiteer from the war . Renegotiation became legal in 1942 , after most experts agreed that no tax law can catch every profiteer without ruining a lot of patriotic producers in the process . It attacks the problem through a company-by-company examination of profits by the agencies that order the goods from the firms in the first place . <P> With this agreement on principle , Congress is not apt to be urged to repeal renegotiation . The question is how to amend it without emasculating it . <P> Renegotiation in Practice . Two prime examples of underprivileged industries under present renegotiation standards are 1 ) machine tools , 2 ) aircraft . Both industries have expanded production under forced draft , and are thus undermining their " normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the most generous Price Adjustment officer can not leave them enough profits to make them feel comfortable about weathering the inevitable postwar storm . <P> Machine tools last 10-40 years . By the end of 1943 the industry will have provided the U.S. with five times more machinery ( 85% of it of the " all purpose " variety ) than it ever had before . Without these machines that produce other machines , the U.S. could not even have armed itself , let alone its allies . Yet the 700-1,100% expansion in tool production , the prerequisite of victory , is now becoming superfluous . New orders reported in August were less than one-third of shipments and are still dropping , and the industry 's backlog is now down to four months capacity . Airplanes are not so long-lived , but the industry 's constantly increasing production poses an even more acute short-term postwar crisis . <P> Both industries headed the groups asking Congress for special treatment in the renegotiation of their profits . They asked : <P> &gt; Renegotiation of profits after taxes , instead of before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit " before taxes means anything . <P> &gt; Permission to set up untaxable , unrenegotiable postwar reserves to take care of their major peace risks : a sold-out market , inflated capacity and payrolls . <P> The machine-tool companies also asked for recognition of " the extent to which a company 's product is expendable in the war effort " ( i.e. , bullets are shot away , but machine tools last indefinitely ) . The aircraft companies insisted upon specific recognition of the enormous working capital problems that will face them when their war contracts are terminated . <P> What Will Be Done ? Congress is at present both business-minded and postwar-conscious . But last week 's Ways &; Means Committee hearings began with a chorus of Administration testimony strongly against any major changes in the renegotiation law .
