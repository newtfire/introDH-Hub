For two centuries , not much has changed in western Montgomery County , the land that suburban sprawl forgot . <p> The scenery brings to mind an Andrew Wyeth painting : weathered barns and farmhouses set amid woods , meadows , pastures and orchards , none more than 35 miles from the White House . Most of the winding two-lane roads are paved , but people cross the Potomac River into Northern Virginia the same way they have since 1828  --  by boat at White 's Ferry . <p> Montgomery County wants to keep its vast countryside  --  twice the size of the District of Columbia  --  the way it 's been since Colonial times . County leaders are trying to prove that a local government in a booming urban area can save a large swath of green space while adding jobs , housing and people . Local governments rarely succeed at this , or even try ; the dominant settlement pattern of U.S. cities is outward , swallowing up larger and larger amounts of forests and farms . <p> " Looking at our country 's development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Norman Dreyfuss , a Montgomery County developer who heads the Suburban Maryland Building Industry Association . <p> So far , however , Montgomery 's preservation strategy is working . No other urban county in the nation has legally protected as much green space  --  93,252 acres  --  from development . Montgomery 's aggressive but little-noticed approach involves buying easements , or restrictions , on thousands of acres of farmland as a fire wall against the spread of housing tracts . An additional 40,000 acres have been protected through a first-of-its-kind exchange program in which developers pay farmers to continue raising crops and animals . In return , the county gives developers permission to build extra housing units in otherwise controlled-growth areas . <p> Called the " agricultural reserve , " the area is part Rock Creek Park , part Old McDonald 's farm . It 's a place for a serene Sunday drive to escape the traffic , noise and congestion of the city , so the kids can see horses or stop at Ben Allnut 's farm near Seneca to pick strawberries , apples or pumpkins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , includes the far western and northern sections of the county , bordered by the Potomac and Frederick and Howard counties . <p> But Montgomery 's cherished reserve is by no means safe forever . Farming 's future in the county is in doubt . Eight of 10 county farmers said in a recent survey that their farm income alone ca n't support their families . If that $ 285 million-a-year industry dies , pressure will build from landowners and developers to turn farmland into houses for a county population projected to swell from 817,000 people today to 1 million in 2020 . <p> " They can preserve all the land they want , but it wo n't be saved if agriculture is n't profitable , " said Jean Phillips , of Germantown , who grows vegetables for Giant Food supermarkets . <p> Eager Speculators <p> Speculators , who own six of every 10 acres in the farm reserve , are eager to march in . A one-acre lot in the reserve currently is worth $ 5,000 , but the value would rise dramatically if the restrictions on the land were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Harry Leet , of Gaithersburg , a retired lawyer who still holds several hundred acres west of Poolesville he bought during the 1960s . <p> Candy giant Mars Inc. , of McLean , one of several companies that own land in the reserve area , led an effort to do an end run around the county five years ago , Montgomery planning officials said . Mars and a few other landowners asked the small town of Laytonsville to annex 1,468 acres of farm reserve to build a luxury home subdivision , tripling the town 's size . Laytonsville rejected the overture , but similar solicitations are possible in the future , officials said . <p> Other pressures come from Northern Virginia . Just as Robert E. Lee 's Confederate troops sloshed across the Potomac at White 's Ferry en route to the battle of Antietam in 1862 , the southerners are threatening to drive north again . <p> This time , the fight is over a plan pushed by Northern Virginia business interests to build a western highway outside the Capital Beltway , linking Interstate 95 in Stafford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Md . One proposed route would slice through the heart of Montgomery 's green space , an idea opposed by every county executive , County Council , planning board and Maryland governor for a decade . <p> " The development pressure it would create would be enormous , " said Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan ( D ) . <p> Metaphor for Md . <p> In many ways , Montgomery County is a metaphor for Maryland , where protection of natural resources is a clear priority of state and local governments . Among counties nationwide that legally protect farmland , seven of the top 10 in acres preserved are in Maryland , led by Montgomery . This year , Gov . Parris N. Glendening ( D ) , has proposed legislation that would channel additional state money to help counties buy easements on farmland restricting development . And he would reward counties with state money if they confine development to existing or planned growth areas while keeping forests , farms and wetlands intact . <p> Maryland 's proximity to the country 's largest estuary , the Chesapeake Bay , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world 's richest fishing grounds . " Maryland feels it is the trustee of the bay , " said Stephen Z. Kaufman , a Silver Spring lawyer who represents many developers . <p> The concept of stewardship is backed by Maryland courts , giving local governments wide authority to set up programs that benefit the community as a whole . In Virginia courts , by contrast , the right of the individual usually outweighs the community good . That leaning , land-use lawyers say , would favor landowners if governments tried to set aside large green areas . Local governments in Virginia also would have to get the state 's permission before establishing a reserve of open space , a requirement not imposed on Maryland counties . <p> Maryland is far from being a preservationist 's ideal ; many of the sprawling neighborhoods of Montgomery are no different from those in Fairfax County . Environmental leaders say Montgomery planners could do more to prevent big houses on big lots , which eat up green space while raising the cost of services such as schools , water and roads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every county will tell you they 've done a great job " saving green space , said Lee Epstein , a top official of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation , a private conservation group . " However , all is not rosy in Montgomery County . There is still a lot of zoning that allows one housing unit on two acres . It 's okay to do a little of that , but if you do a lot , it 's called sprawl . " <p> Planning Ahead <p> Royce Hanson came to Montgomery County during the 1950s when the postwar expansion of the suburbs drove up land prices and increased development pressure . By 1960 , the land had greater value for houses than farms , triggering a rush by speculators , who bought up more than half of the county 's land . <p> Hanson , then a professor of government at American University , was appointed to the county planning board in 1971 to help brake Montgomery 's growth . Despite the board 's slower , orderly approach to development , Montgomery still was losing about 1,300 acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rural Montgomery brimmed with spacious homes on five-acre lots , a pattern that was killing farming , consuming green space and driving up property taxes needed to pay for the services . <p> Hanson , by then chairman of the planning board , set about to stop the hemorrhaging . The son of an Arkansas truck farmer , Hanson knew how to talk to farmers and had a feel for the land . <p> " As early as I can remember , I had a commitment to conservation . And I understood something about living on the soil , so I had sentiments resonant with farmers , " said Hanson , now a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas . <p> Like generals preparing for battle , the board first drew a defensive line around the immense area of the county where farms outnumbered subdivisions . Only one home would be allowed on each 25 acres within this area , a limit that would discourage home building , since few people want a single-family home on that much land . As further restraints , roads were n't to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extended . With that , Hanson and the board believed they had set Montgomery 's growth patterns for generations . <p> " Until this , there were always going to be areas of the county up for grabs , " said Kaufman , the developers ' attorney . <p> Winning over farmers depended on Hanson 's finding a way to compensate them for the land value they 'd lose once the reserve was created and their acreage probably could n't be sold for home building . The shift would undercut the equity they depended on for major expenses , including their retirement and their children 's college education . " We had to make the farmers feel they were being treated fairly , " Hanson said . <p> The budget-minded county did n't have the money to pay farmers for the lost value , but Hanson 's staff reminded him of a concept that had been tried in a few regions with mixed success . Farmers would continue working their land in exchange for selling " rights " to developers to build homes elsewhere in Montgomery . <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their profits by increasing the number of homes they built in a subdivision . The county could keep green space while steering growth into areas such as Olney and Potomac , where it had ample roads , utilities and schools . <p> " We had created a balance : conservation of a rural area that was to be a kind of cultural resource , and higher-density housing where we had the public facilities to support it . That 's an efficient pattern of development , " Hanson said . <p> At first farmers did n't like Hanson 's plan , shouting down county officials at an endless series of meetings and accusing them of engineering " a communist plot " to take their land . Months of intricate negotiations followed , with farmers reluctantly going along . To this day , some farmers said they believe they got a raw deal . <p> " We could have fought and fought and wound up with nothing , " said Drew Stabler , whose family has farmed for seven generations near Brookeville . " Short-term , yes , I would have been against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity . But we looked at it long-term , for the good of the family and the area . It gave agriculture a lease on life . " <p> Stabler and his brother , Robert , who are field crop and livestock farmers , were assigned development " rights " in the early 1980s based on a formula of one right for each five acres . Then they waited for a developer to approach them . <p> In 1985 , Leonard Kapiloff , a dentist , developer and newspaper owner , was planning a subdivision on land he owned in fast-growing Olney , just east of Georgia Avenue and a few miles from the Stablers ' farm . Kapiloff put up $ 3.2 million to purchase 637 development rights from 35 landowners , including the Stablers . With those rights , he won county permission to build 1,200 single-family homes and town houses on his site , rather than the 200 single-family homes that would be have been his limit without the extra development chits . <p> Subdivision Born <p> Thus was the Hallowell Farms subdivision born . The Stablers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible the houses along St. Theresa Drive and Buehler Road . David Keyman , a retirement fund manager , bought one of the houses on St. Theresa , and the Stablers used their money to buy more land and equipment . " It was Montgomery County 's way to save some green space without the developers taking it over , " said Keyman , now 44 and a divorced father of two children . <p> Other residents on the receiving end of development are n't thrilled that their neighborhoods are more crowded because of the transfer program . " The county has n't followed through on its commitment to put additional money for adequate schools , roads and parks " in places such as Olney and Fairland , said Stuart Rochester , a Fairland community activist . " To be fair , you have to give the receiving areas the infrastructure . " <p> County leaders have n't relied on the development rights program alone to guard the agricultural reserve . They also spend about $ 1 million a year to buy easements on farmland in strategic locations along the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development stops and green space begins . Since 1990 , the county has bought development restrictions on 48 farms , covering 5,383 acres . Glendening wants toput additional dollars into a similar state program that has allowed Montgomery to purchase easements on nine other farms with state money . <p> Parcel by parcel , the county is deliberately putting up a " defensible perimeter , " as one official put it , to prevent developers from considering incursions into the agricultural reserve . <p> " Even if someone was thinking about extending water and sewer lines into the reserve to build houses , you 'd still have to get past thousands of acres of protected land along the eastern edge to do it , " said Edward Thompson Jr. , of Barnesville , chairman of the county 's agriculture preservation advisory board . <p> Developer 's View <p> On a recent drive through the Montgomery County countryside , prominent Northern Virginia developer John T. " Til " Hazel said he " did n't see anything that was worth a damn . " <p> " All I saw was a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weeds growing up in a field , a lot of vacant land , " said Hazel , also a lawyer and farmer . " Unless it 's functional or producing . . . that whole western county out there is a wasteland . " <p> For years , Hazel has led the chargefor a new highway outside the Beltway linking I-95 in Northern Virginia with I-70 in Maryland . Under some of the proposed routes , the road would cut through western Montgomery . This would give drivers another river crossing to avoid the congested Beltway , better access to Dulles International Airport and a new path to the job centers of Northern Virginia . <p> Maryland officials argue that the road would serve only Virginia development interests while ruining the pastoral landscape Montgomery has tried so hard to save . It also would boost travel at Dulles at the expense of Baltimore-Washington International Airport , the state 's main airport . <p> For now , Virginia officials are going ahead with plans to build the part of the road on their side of the river . They believe Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Montgomery or Frederick county . Figures from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments show that by 2010 , Montgomery and Frederick counties will send three commuters across the American Legion Bridge for every Northern Virginia driver heading to a job in Maryland . <p> " If that pattern continues , voters in Maryland will turn to their government and say , ' You 've got to find away for us to get across the river , ' " said Leo J. Schefer , head of the Washington Airports Task Force , an organization that promotes Dulles . Schefer , Hazel and others say the road could be designed as a parkway , with a limited number of interchanges , to satisfy preservationists . <p> " I 'd tell Til Hazel not to hold his breath , " said Hanson , the father of the agricultural reserve . <p> The reserve 's survival also depends on a healthy agriculture industry . If farming is n't profitable and farm children do n't put on their parents ' overalls  --  the average age of Montgomery farmers is 57  --  developers can argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone in Montgomery . Farm families are relying on second jobs for income , and most farm children are looking for anything but agriculture jobs . Machinery dealers and seed and supply houses have fled the county . Those who stay in farming increasingly are shifting to flowers , sod , pick-your-own fruits and vegetables and horses . <p> " Agriculture has constantly been evolving , " said Ben Allnut , whose family has been farming near Seneca Creek for 200 years . His father grew corn , but Allnut plants the fruits and vegetables that supply local Giant and other supermarkets . Schoolchildren tour his farm , and down-county residents come to pick the bounty . <p> Worried Neighbors <p> A few miles from Allnut 's farm , in Beallsville , Jane Hunter and her neighbors have a different worry . County officials have grabbed about 3,000 acres from the reserve for a landfill , incinerator and composting plant , which Hunter said mars the natural beauty of the reserve . Hunter and others fear more of the same . <p> " They talk about this reserve being nationally acclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Delores Milmoe , of Beallsville . <p> Annexation is another potential menace . Poolesville , Barnesville and Laytonsville are among seven towns and villages within the farm reserve that can annex county land virtually unchallenged ; a developer could offer them enticing promises to build roads and boost tax revenue . <p> " If we saw towns doing annexation that jeopardized the reserve , I suspect we 'd go to court to prevent that , " said County Executive Duncan . <p> Duncan and other officials said they believe Montgomery 's countryside will stay green for decades . The county still has plenty of room for growth in places such as Clarksburg and Germantown and ample opportunities to redevelop aging neighborhoods in Silver Spring and elsewhere . A politician who suggested development in the farm reserve would risk certain defeat , they said . <p> " The reserve is the secular faith of Montgomery County , " said Gus Bauman , a Washington lawyer and former chairman of the county planning board . " We 've proved you can do both : save agricultural resources and still provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future County Council " could always bag it , " warned council member Nancy Dacek ( R ) , of Darnestown , whose district includes the reserve . A pro-development council was elected in the early 1960s in Montgomery , and the pendulum could always swing back . No one knows that better than the farmers . <p> " For years , we 've talked about protecting western Montgomery County and building up Olney and other places , " said farmer Stabler . " Who 's to say sometime in the future Maryland might say , ' Let 's protect the Eastern Shore and build up Howard and Montgomery county ' ? " <p> Major developers in the county said they have no current interest in invading the reserve . The idea would be as silly as New York City leveling Central Park for skyscrapers , said Kaufman , the developers ' attorney . <p> But Tony Natelli , who built the upscale Avenel subdivision in Potomac through extensive purchase of development rights from farmers , raised the inevitable dilemma for the future . As Montgomery County matures , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a green setting . <p> " In later years , " Natelli said , " are people going to be willing to live in high-rises instead of the good old American dream ? " <p> ABOUT THIS SERIES <p> Sunday : Every day in the Washington region , an average of 28 acres of open land is lost to residential , commercial or industrial use . Although residents disagree whether the phenomenon is good or bad , the disappearance of green space is altering the area 's distinctive appearance as well as the quality and texture of people 's lives . <p> Monday : Commanding the western flank of the Washington region , Loudoun County is the area 's fastest-growing jurisdiction . The collision between developers and preservationists is emblematic of conflicting values in Virginia , where landowners have long had free rein . <p> Today : No urban county in the nation has legally preserved more green space than Montgomery County , where an aggressive but little-noticed program mirrors Maryland efforts to channel suburban sprawl . But Montgomery 's cherished reserve is nonetheless under threat .
