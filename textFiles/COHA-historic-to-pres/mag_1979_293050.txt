A historic treaty and a first meeting between rivals <P> After seven years of negotiations that ended in the announcement of agreement on a SALT II treaty on May 9 , U.S. and Soviet diplomats in Geneva still had to work late every night last week on that very same treaty . Their task : to get the final Russian and English terms of the 76-page document into shape for Jimmy Carter and Leonid Brezhnev to sign next Monday in Vienna . Alternating between the drab Soviet mission near the U.N . ' s Palais des Nations and the more spacious U.S. quarters overlooking the botanical garden and Lake Geneva , U.S. Envoy Ralph Earle and the Soviets ' Victor Karpov found that the final dotting of z 's and crossing of fs was unexpectedly difficult . Lamented one U.S. official : " We still do n't know when the work will be finished . " <P> Would it be done in time for the enounter that the whole world will be watching ? <P> Said the American : " It better be . " <P> The delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be trying to shade some nuances in their favor . Senate G.O.P. Leader Howard Baker Jr . warned darkly about the pressures of " deadline diplomacy . " But an Administration official insisted that there was no cause for concern . Even so , the two leaders may yet have to settle some of the fine print during their face-to-face sessions this weekend . <P> In contrast to the feverish activity in Geneva , summit preparations went on almost serenely in Vienna , where the treaty is to be signed at 1 p.m. in the Redoutensaal , a gold-and-white ballroom in the sprawling Hofburg , the Habsburg dynasty 's Imperial Palace . Vienna officials were taking the summit preparations very much in stride . The Redoutensaal was occupied last week by negotiators at the interminable M.B.F.R. talks on troop reductions in Central Europe . Not until this week could workmen begin erecting bleacher seats for the 1,200 journalists expected to witness the SALT II signing . That the agreement on nuclear weapons will be signed in the Hofburg seemed fitting : the palace was a headquarters of the 1814-15 Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe that lasted for nearly a century . SALT II will expire in 1985 , but by then U.S. and Soviet leaders hope a more lasting agreement will have been negotiated . <P> In Moscow and Washington , where Brezhnev and Carter were being prepped by their staffs for the summit , the biggest uncertainty was the health of the ailing Soviet party chief ( see ESSAY ) . Brezhnev seemed in good shape two weeks ago during his visit to Budapest , where he declared : " We shall go to Vienna fully prepared for an active and constructive dialogue . " In Moscow , Andrei Kirilenko , who as the party 's Central Committee Secretary-General is No. 2 to Brezhnev , told U.S. Ambassador Malcolm Toon that both countries expected " a great deal " of the summit and expressed the hope that both would make " great efforts . " A Soviet official told TIME : " While we can hope for frequent summits , we do n't really know when the next one might be . So the American Government should at least try .
