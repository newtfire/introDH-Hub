Everybody 's Favorite Redskin to Pick On came off the practice field last night . Mark Brunell knows there is no open competition for the quarterback job this year . It belongs to Patrick Ramsey , who is at once Brunell 's close friend and the most visible impediment to becoming an NFL starter again . <p> " It 's nice to be out there , but every backup  --  third string , second string , does n't matter  --  wants to be out there starting , " Brunell said . <p> He is asked about last season . The derisive chants . The benching . The losing . <p> " It was very tough , " Brunell said . " I came up here with high expectations . " <p> He 's still here ? He 's still here . <p> Here 's what Sonny Jurgensen says about quarterbacks and criticism : " It goes with the position . They told me I would n't play two weeks here because of my throwing motion . You ca n't let that bother you . " <p> Jurgensen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Philadelphia Eagles in a game against Dallas . " It was so bad my teammates were booing me when I came into the huddle , " he said . " I threw two interceptions on my first two attempts . It got so ugly , people were coming out of the stands , fighting with the trainer . Before it was over , I threw five touchdowns . I think they cheered moderately . " <p> Brunell caught much of the same flack last year . For much of a 6-10 season , the most irate fans did not want Brunell merely benched ; they wanted him abandoned , jettisoned to the curb like a musty sofa unfit for a new home . <p> When no one could bring themselves to take umbrage with Joe Gibbs 's archaic offense , Brunell and his seven-year , $43 million contract became the blocking dummy for every bit of fan frustration . Depending upon which season ticket holder you asked , his arm was either weak , dead or in need of amputation . <p> Brunell expected the criticism , even some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want my money back " did not bother him as much as the incessant booing at FedEx Field , which grew in volume and intensity each week until Ramsey finally replaced him as the starter in the ninth game . <p> " The boos , that was the hardest thing , " Brunell said . " You know , my kids were up in the stands , hearing all that . " Two of his four children were old enough to grasp the venom . " They understood what was happening with their dad . " <p> At least they were spared cruelty in the classroom . <p> " We home-school them , " Brunell said . " It 's a good thing , too . Can you imagine the abuse they 'd take ? " <p> The feeling among most observers is that Ramsey will have a short leash , that Brunell may have a chance to professionally redeem himself if Ramsey can not muster a few wins early . Whether that 's true or not , here 's what you should know about Brunell before you write him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammates , to clear salary cap room . <p> Ramsey said he 's actually grown closer to Brunell since he took the job from him last season . " Not only can he still play , he 's invaluable in the locker room , one of those guys that just has that special something that makes you believe you can win . " <p> And know this : It does n't matter if all of FedEx Field does not believe he can throw deep or lead a sustained drive for a score anymore . Gibbs believes in Brunell , and no one else 's opinion , frankly , counts . <p> " If you go back in my past , people have said I 'm too loyal sometimes , " Gibbs said yesterday after practice . " They said I was too loyal to Joe Theismann . But for me , it 's more of a feel thing , what you think is right . " <p> Gibbs saw what everyone saw : Brunell rolling out forever , it seemed , looking for a receiver . ( Let 's be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franken . ) But Gibbs also saw the receivers that did not quite run the right routes , the pass-block breakdowns , an offense that did not exactly cater to Brunell 's abilities . <p> Brunell built his reputation on a five-step drop in Jacksonville , firing bullets toward the tips of his wideouts ' fingers . The less time he had to think , the more effective he was . With the Redskins , he began a seven-step drop . He had more time to evade a rush but less time to look downfield . Washington also put such a premium on protecting the quarterback that eight teammates were often kept back to block , sometimes leaving only two receivers for four defensive backs and three linebackers to cover . <p> Ramsey is the first to admit he became the beneficiary of a slightly upgraded offense . With the hiring of quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave , once the backup to Joe Montana and Steve Young and a coach who lived the West Coast offense , there are likely to be more options . As much as Musgrave has helped Ramsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of coach Brunell could also thrive under . <p> That might be heresy to suggest a little over one week into training camp , especially for a 34-year-old quarterback whom many in the NFL believe is on the downside of his career . But at some point  --  either in Washington or elsewhere  --  he will get a shot to prove he can play again . Whether Gibbs will give Brunell the leash as he did a year ago is another question . <p> Why did Gibbs stay with Brunell so long , including after a 2-4 start going into a bye week ? In hindsight , it was the Cowboys ' fault . Brunell had won the opener and looked good against the New York Giants before a groin injury forced him to the sideline . He had played five good quarters of football when Ramsey came in and promptly threw three interceptions in a loss . Gibbs thought Brunell would be out the next week against Dallas on Monday night and then Brunell , the back of his leg badly bruised , shocked him and suited up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss , bringing his team close in the final quarter . <p> With Brunell , it was n't just about numbers . " There 's other things that influence your decision , too , " Gibbs said . " He came out after the Giants game and his hamstring was literally black and blue . You could see the colors . And for him to come out and want to play and win that badly , well , those things come into your decision making , too . " <p> His grit and resolve made a believer out of the coach . For better or worse , Brunell became to Gibbs what John Starks was to Pat Riley , what Pedro Martinez was to Grady Little : the guy whose heart you believe in so much that you convince yourself it can make up for anything in fatigue , injury or ability . For Gibbs , Brunell as a competitor and a person superseded anything he did on the field in those first few games . With Ramsey struggling , Gibbs believed Brunell was the best man for the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramsey started to hurt his own legacy . <p> Bottom line : Given a sputtering offense and the unrealistic expectations of Gibbs taking over a 5-11 team , Brunell was not as bad as he looked . He is still here , a valuable backup , a consummate professional and a man itching to amend his standing on the field . " I could 've played better , " Brunell said . " And if I get that chance again , I 'd like to show it . "
