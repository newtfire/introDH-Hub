<p> The Rotisserie League lets you do what you always knew you could  --  run a team better than the people who actually do it for a living <p> Perhaps you know me . Perhaps you are the trucker who was drinking midnight coffee late in April 1989 in Moody 's in Waldoboro , Maine , listening with drooping eyelids as I waffled over placing Oakland Athletics designated hitter Dave Parker and his .194 batting average on my reserve roster . Perhaps you are the woman on Piedmont Airlines flight No. 1841 in late July , your smile frozen on your face from Newark to Baltimore as I debated aloud whether or not I should trade Kansas City Royals pitcher Bret Saberhagen despite his ten wins and 2.81 earned run average . Perhaps you are the young couple who sat next to me in Boston 's Fenway Park in early June as I stood , alone among 33,584 souls , screeching wildly while Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Junior Felix raced around the bases to complete an inside-the-park grand slam home run against the hometown Red Sox . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's mine , mine , mine ! " In retrospect , I 'm not surprised you changed your seats . <p> If you do not know me , you know someone like me . In America in 1990 it is almost impossible not to know somebody who has more or less given up family , friends and responsibility to participate in Rotisserie League Baseball , aka Rotiss , aka Ro-ball , aka the Greatest Game for Baseball Fans Since Baseball . Few people any longer assume that Rotisserie League Baseball must be some kind of cooking competition . If they do not know the details of the game  --  and there is no shortage of details of the game to know  --  they at least know that it involves folks like me " owning " teams made up of real major league players and competing with like-afflicted individuals via the cumulative statistics of these players as compiled in actual games . <p> And outsiders probably know that players can be traded among " owners " within a given league ; that they can be banished to or beckoned from reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cussed , applauded , damned , praised , denounced , admired and wept over . But what RLB really does is allow baseball fans to do what they always knew deep down in their heart of hearts that they could do : run a team better than the people who actually do it for a living . <p> There are eight categories of RLB stats . For hitters : batting average , home runs , runs batted in and stolen bases . For pitchers : wins , saves , earned run average and the wonderfully arcane **26;36;TOOLONG ratio . Standings are calculated weekly , with teams ranked according to performance in each category : 12 points for first place ( in a 12-team league ) , 11 for second and so on . Thus , a perfect score is 96 ( 8 times 12 ) , while the ultimate in futility is 8 ( 8 times 1 ) . Some leagues calculate their own standings , but most rely on one of the many computer-based statistical services that have sprung up within the RLB universe . It 's really Moriarty League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of " fantasy " baseball in which participants create their own teams , although several knockoffs have surfaced . ( For better or worse , there are now even fantasy football and fantasy basketball leagues . ) RLB was born during the 1979-80 off-season when a small cadre of like-thinking New Yorkers , most of whom worked in publishing , met at La Rotisserie Francaise , an East Side restaurant now defunct . Let history note , however , that the concept was formalized by the same group a few months later at another bygone Manhattan eatery , P. J. Moriarty . Thus , tens of thousands of Americans are really playing Moriarty League Baseball . <p> Daniel Okrent of the tiny town of Worthington , Massachusetts ( pop . I , 150 ) , holds the RLB title of Beloved Founder and Former Commissioner-for-Life . A 31-year-old freelance writer and editor at the time , he is generally credited with having had the Frankensteinian idea that grew into RLB . He still plays the game , although much in the manner that the Cleveland Indians play real baseball : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third place . <p> In 1986 Okrent and the other original Rotisserians trademarked the Rotisserie name , but they have profited little from their idea . Their Rotisserie League Baseball Association Inc. publishes a newsletter , provides a stat service for leagues , organizes an annual " convention " at baseball 's spring training sites , peddles T-shirts and generally serves as RLB 's quasi-official voice . It has one full-time employee , but the Beloved Founder remains irrevocably linked . " I 'm convinced , " he says , " that if I bring about world peace and find a cure for cancer , the headline on my obituary will still be Okrent Dies  --  Invented Rotisserie . ' " <p> I had managed to steer clear of all this for nearly a decade . For more than 30 years I had devoted myself to the Boston Red Sox , an exercise in masochism that only a New Englander  --  or a Chicago Cubs fan  --  can understand . This marriage ended on the evening of October 25 , 1986 , when , while seated in New York 's Shea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat of Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson meander through the legs of Sox first baseman Bill Buckner , with two outs in the bottom of the tenth inning of the sixth game of the World Series . This horrifying yet predictable act ended a game in which the Red Sox , who a few moments earlier had held a two-run lead with no Mets on base , were one out away from winning the Series for the first time since 1918 ; The fact that they lost the seventh and final game two nights later was of no consequence to me . That fateful ground ball had forever terminated my relationship with the team . To this day I do not care if the Red Sox win , lose or move to Dubuque . A rookie season of despair , hope and resignation <p> The divorce , however , left a void in my life . I was still following major league baseball , but in a desultory fashion . I needed to get involved with the game again , but dispassionately . Thus , in the autumn of 1988 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been overcome with RLB . I became co-owner of the Danzig Bears in the League of Nations , a 12-team Rotisserie league based in the Connecticut River Valley of western Massachusetts , about 90 miles west of my home in Boston . It is a collection of kindred souls much like , say , Ft . Worth 's Cowtown League or Detroit 's Michigan Baseball Confederacy . Last year was my rookie season in the league , a six-month odyssey of despair , hope , and finally , resignation  --  not to mention 7 player trades , 21 other roster moves , 964 miles of driving to and from league gatherings and $208.63 in long-distance telephone charges . <p> I realized the League of Nations was my kind of outfit when seven brands of beer were served at its annual fall owners ' meeting . While some leagues are little more than gambling operations whose stakes run into the thousands of dollars , the League of Nations is strictly for low rollers . All leagues collect fees from their owners for players who are " bought " at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moves such as trades and call-ups from reserve rosters , and the booty goes to the first four finishers at the end of the season . " Official " rules  --  often modified by individual leagues  --  state that each team can spend a maximum of $260 for players at the draft . The League of Nations limit is $46 . Explains Anthony Lake , full-time professor of international relations , part-time farmer and co-owner of the Smuts Peddlers , a team known for its refusal to own anyone who plays for the New York Yankees : " There should never be more at stake than the cost of one spring calf . " Personally , I like this sensible approach . On the other hand , I am sorely disappointed that the League of Nations does not stage an annual Yoo-Hoo Ceremony ( Article XX of the Official Constitution of Rotisserie League Baseball ) , wherein a bottle of the chocolate-flavored drink once endorsed by Yogi Berra is poured over the head of the pennant winner . <p> Still , like RLB itself , the League of Nations is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  two are women  --  who range in age from 13 to 57 , are college professors , which explains why teams in the league have taken their names from real League of Nations history . ( The city of Danzig , for example , was under the protection of the League during the early 1920s . Jan Smuts , South Africa 's prime minister from 1919 to 1924 , was a staunch supporter of the organization . ) And although one should n't overlook former scatterarm fireballer Stephen Philbrick , now a farmer and poet , who pitched in college and whose primary job as a Peddlers co-owner is to scout scatter-arm fireballers , authentic baseball experience is practically nonexistent within the league . <p> The League of Nations is best exemplified by the fact that , when basketball trophies were erroneously delivered to its 1988 awards banquet , nobody cared . Yet , I was mercilessly grilled on my qualifications for ownership . Question : How many box scores are you willing to read each day in order to get the same results you 've already gotten in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games on TV the night before ? Answer : You can never read too many box scores . Accepted ! <p> Most Rotisserie teams are partnerships . My partner in the Bears front office is Stephen Kulik , an easygoing administrator at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , who is also a selectman in the town of Worthington , coincidentally the home of the Beloved Founder . Luckily , these two endeavors do not infringe upon Kulik 's RLB time . " The preparation he does for the annual draft is certainly more than he does for anything else , including the town budget , " points out his wife , Suzanne . Although one often hears tales of RLB causing domestic disharmony and even divorce , the Kuliks have reached an accord worthy of the original League of Nations itself . " Here 's the deal , " says Suzanne . " Stephen can talk about it as much as he wants , but I do n't have to listen . " <p> The Bears had finished in eighth place in 1988 , the year before I joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-life baseball executive , blamed this mediocre performance partly on injuries . " We can only do better , " he murmured as we hunkered down inside T. D. Smith 's Diner in Springfield for a midwinter strategy session . Under RLB rules , we would be allowed to begin the 1989 season with as many as 15 holdover players , the remainder for our 23-man squad of 9 pitchers , 6 infielders , 5 outfielders , 2 catchers and I designated hitter to be acquired at the April draft . But this did n't preclude us from bolstering our roster through preseason trades . Trades are the heartbeat of RLB , a more-or-less-adult extension of swapping baseball cards . We would soon recall the baseball execs ( or was it a kid hoarding a wad of baseball cards ? ) who say the best trades are the ones you do n't make . <p> I immediately entered the fray . After spending several evenings identifying what I thought were underpriced pitchers  --  RLB teams have a salary cap , with a player 's " salary " being the amount for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I decided I could n't live without Cecilio Guante , a Texas Rangers relief pitcher who had won only 21 games and saved 33 more in seven major league seasons but was clearly destined for better things . Besides , his salary was a mere 35 cents . The Sun-Yat Senators were willing to part with him in exchange for Craig Worthington , a Baltimore Orioles rookie third baseman whose salary was $2 . We 'd be saving $1.65 in wages and getting the next Dennis Eckersley at the same time ! Who cared that Worthington is a great fielder and had been selected the most valuable player in the International League for 1988 ? Being able to catch the ball does n't count in RLB , right ? Besides , everybody knew that Worthington would n't be able to hit major league pitching . The deal done , Craig Worthington went on to hit major league pitching so well in 1989 ( 15 Hits , 70 RBIs ) that it seemed like he must have been batting against Cecilio Guante ( 6 wins , 2 saves ) half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas at the end of the season . <p> We knew none of this , however , when the League of Nations convened around a large table in the Geology Department of Amherst College on Draft Day , April 8 , 1989 . Outdoors , normal people frolicked in the sun . Indoors , abnormal people brooded over piles of statistics . " Trader Jack " Cheney of the feared Hammerin ' Sickles , a geology professor , was , as usual , contemplating the acquisition of a roster heavily laden with Latin American players . Lake of the Smuts Peddlers was again using computer-generated data to predict players ' performances during the upcoming season . Clark Dougan , a writer-editor whose Manchurian Candidates had won the pennant the season before , was looking forward to another year of listening to split bands from high atop a hill in the hamlet of Pelham . ( Split bands are radio frequencies on which two adjoining stations can be heard simultaneously if the listener is in the right place at the right time . This means you can monitor , say , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Yankees-White Sox game on WABC out of New York on the same radio . To Rotisserians seeking to learn how their players are performing , two games are infinitely better than one . ) <p> But the Bears were ready , too . A cottage publishing industry has sprung up around RLB , and I had carefully studied most of the obscure tip sheets , detailed newsletters and single-minded magazines that clutter the market . Although some Rotisserie leagues are " mixed , " most consist entirely of American League or National League players . The League of Nations uses only American League players . Among the things I knew to be unalterably true for 1989 was that Teddy Higuera , a Mexican-born ace of the Milwaukee Brewers pitching staff , was going to return from off-season back surgery to become , as usual , a stellar performer in the American League . Everyone said so . Thus did I find myself bidding an astronomical  --  by League of Nations standards  --  $6.60 for Higuera 's services . No matter . He would anchor a team that included : Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team record with 34 saves the previous season . Almost every successful RLB team has at least one pitcher with 30 or more saves ; White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk , statistically the best American League catcher . Getting good stats from a catcher is like getting an unexpected tax refund ; Rangers second baseman Julio Franco , a consistent .300 hitter . In RLB , where fielding does n't count , infielders are a lot like catchers : you hope they wo n't leave you sleepless with their batting  --  or lack thereof . Owning one who hits like Franco is a bonus ; Blue Jays outfielder George Bell , drafted by the Bears at a reasonable price-$5.60-because other teams figured he had peaked two years earlier when he was selected the American League 's most valuable player . A possible bargain ; Royals starting pitcher Bret Saberhagen , an ex-Bear who returned to the den . Dropped by the Bears after the 1988 season because he seemed overpriced at his previous $5.55 salary , he was redrafted by us at $4.90 in the Draft Day bidding . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bears front office was confident . Besides , my work as a newspaper reporter gave me computer access to breaking wire-service stories , all the better to acquire early information so necessary for trading . I had my obligatory subscriptions to Baseball America magazine for minor league scouting , and to USA Today for daily statistics and box scores . I had cable TV , which brought me ESPN , NESN , CNN and the rest of the video alphabet soup of games and updates . I had been given fair warning that RLB would forever alter my perception of the gospel according to the box score , that I would now be interested in the performances of major league players rather than major league teams . I may have been a rookie , but I had prepared for the 1989 season like a veteran . <p> What I had not prepared for was being in last place . But there it was , just four weeks into the season , revealed in the eight-page computer printout that the League of Nations owners receive every Thursday from Heath Research of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most successful of RLB stat suppliers , serviced 177 leagues and grossed approximately $125,000 last year . ) The Bears were in the cellar ! With only 28 points ! " We 've never been in last place before , not once in five years , " moaned Kulik in a tone of voice that suggested that if RLB had had provisions for trading co-owners , I would have been gone . While the Bears could not hit , neither could they pitch . In no single statistical category did we rank higher than eighth in the league . Fisk had a broken hand . Higuera was still recovering from back surgery and had n't pitched at all . Duane Ward of the Blue Jays , a mainstay of our bull pen , lost six games in the first month of the season , practically a statistical impossibility for a relief pitcher . These events may have troubled the White Sox , Brewers and Blue Jays respectively , but collectively they devastated the Danzig Bears . <p> I had more to learn . At 8:57 P.M. EST on April 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV as Franco hit a two-run home run off Wes Gardner of the Red Sox . I was stunned . Franco was a Bear . Gardner was a Bear . How was I to react ? It was , like the season ahead , a frustrating mixture of joy and despair . <p> May The Bears wormed their way into tenth place with 44 points , 29.5 points out of first place . In four appearances , the costly Higuera won no games , acquired a stiff back and sprained an ankle . The Bears sent him a get-well card . Desperate for pitching , we celebrated Memorial Day by sending hard-hitting White Sox outfielder Ivan Calderon to the first-place-but-slumping Smuts Peddlers in exchange for Scott Bankhead , a promising young pitcher for the Seattle Mariners . " I like the guy , " co-owner Kulik said of him , though he had only two wins and a lackluster 4.67 earned run average so far . As the man who would become notorious for having faith in Cecilio Guante , who was I to argue ? Ecstasy , despondency  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 55.5 points , 28 points out of first place . We passed the Bosnian Bombers , St. Petersburg Monarchs , Easter Uprising , Manchurian Candidates and Sun-Yat Senators . Giddiness reigned in our clubhouse . When Saberhagen did n't pitch for ten days , and the wire services failed to report the reason , I anxiously called the Royals front office and pretended to represent a group of concerned citizens from the pitcher 's hometown in Illinois . I explained that we wanted to attend one of his games but were n't sure when he would pitch again . A polite woman said not to worry , that Saberhagen merely had a stiff right shoulder and would pitch the next day , which he did , striking out seven batters in six innings . And on one of many scouting trips to Fenway Park , I watched Junior Felix , our rookie Blue Jays outfielder , drive in 11 runs in three games . On the other hand , I listened in horror to WABC out of New York as Orioles rookie pitcher Bob Milacki , who moonlights as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fly ball disappeared in the fog in the ninth inning . This is the essence of RLB : ecstasy one day , despondency the next . In other league news , the Hammerin ' Sickles took over first place from the slipping Peddlers . The Sickles ' Trader Jack was too nervous to listen to games on the radio or watch them on TV . " I ca n't afford the Rolaids , " he murmured . <p> July The Bears moved up to fourth place , then slipped back to fifth with 58.5 points , 22.5 points out of first place . The League of Nations Annual Mid-Season Picnic and Wiffleball Game took place on Tony Lake 's farm . " Do n't invest in me , " muttered Trader Jack , even as the Hammerin ' Sickles led the league by 13 points . Despite his name , the Trader had made no deals since opening day . Unbelievably , he asked us about the availability of Higuera . Even more unbelievably , we were not interested in trading Our Teddy . This is because RLB owners operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or traded for him he must be good ; 2 ) If he 's playing poorly it 's only for a while ; 3 ) If I trade him he 'll become the next Jim Palmer or the next Willie Mays . Just then we were operating under Axiom No. 2 because Higuera had won three games in July and had a respectable 3.25 earned run average for the month . As for the legendary Junior Felix , he ran into an outfield fence , thereby separating his shoulder . The Bears made a note to send him a card . <p> August The Bears languished in fifth place with 59.5 points , 23.5 points out of first place . Here was the essence of Rotisserie craziness : we lost shortstop Dick Schofield of the California Angels for several weeks when he was hit in the hand by a pitch thrown by Scott Bankhead . Both are Bears . Meanwhile , a couple of Bears were acting like hockey players : Red Sox pitcher Wes Gardner was arrested on an assault charge , while George Bell was suspended for two games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Lake stunned us by resigning as general manager of the Smuts Peddlers , claiming he needed a rest because of creeping sanity : " Little things are happening . For instance , I found myself caring about who was winning real games , rather than just studying individual performances . And one day I actually read the front page of the newspaper before the sports page . I need time to get insane again . " The Bears made a note to send him a card . <p> September The Bears were tied for fourth place with 61 points , 18.5 points out of first place . All hopes of a pennant dashed , the team 's owners tried to hold ground . " Who cares about money ? " asked Kulik . " It 's the glory . " In a final , futile gesture , the Bears recalled Sam Horn from their reserve roster . Horn was a gigantic Red Sox first baseman who responded to the call-up by raising his batting average from .128 to .148 , among the worst in the American League . The Bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face by a ground ball and had his season mercifully ended before his 5.97 earned run average could go higher . But Saberhagen won his 23d game , Bell drove in his 104th run , Bankhead had 11 wins against only 2 losses since becoming a Bear , and Franco 's batting average was a nifty .316 . And Teddy ? Higuera , now with a strained shoulder and a virus , finished with 9 wins , a 3.46 earned run average and an American League record for most ailments by a left-handed pitcher in a single season . <p> October 1 The Bears finished in . . . sixth place with 59 points , 18.5 points out of first place . ( In related news , the Hammerin ' Sickles held off the fast-charging Yalta Boys by 2.5 points to win the 1989 League of Nations flag . ) For the Bears , the end was bitter . Franco , the team 's hitting star and owner of 92 runs batted in , pulled a muscle in his lower back and missed the final week of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got only one more in the final week . These two seemingly small setbacks , unnoticed amid the flotsam and jetsam of world events , were disastrous . If the Bears had gotten just one more RBI for the season ( 732 instead of 731 ) and one more save ( 52 instead of 51 ) , the team would have tied for fourth place with the Smuts Peddlers , i.e. , in the money . Heath Research cruelly calculated where all teams in the league would have finished if no trades or roster moves had been made after the April draft . Bad news , Bears : had we not painstakingly engineered 28 roster changes , we would have finished in third place . <p> A few days after the season ended , the League of Nations owners gathered around a large table laden not with hot dogs but with Caribbean food . This time the top four finishers actually received baseball trophies , or would have if the prizes had been delivered on time . There was no Yoo-Hoo , either . Also absent was Trader Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even as he remained at home with a sick child ( " The only thing that would have kept me away " ) , the Trader was already viewing the 1990 season with unbridled , unabashed and unremitting cynicism . " All I see are sore arms and blown knees , " he grumbled . <p> Today , as the Danzig Bears play another season on the fields of fantasy , I raise my eyes to the heavens and , drawing on Simon and Garfunkel , pose a question to the ages : Where have you gone , Cecilio Guante ? <p> Actually , my query is not rhetorical . I know the answer . Guante has gone to the Cleveland Indians , where he is earning $650,000 for the 1990 season . Which is $649,999.65 more than his salary as a Danzig Bear . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " The chocolate-flavored drink endorsed by Yogi Berra is poured over winner 's head in Yoo-Hoo Ceremony .
