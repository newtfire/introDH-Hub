THEM : came a cold Friday morning when Clyde and I thought ourselves half-frozen all the way to school , A strong wind rose and rose all day , and by night was sweeping down icily out of the nor ( h . We fought our way home for two miles against . it that afternoon , and all the evening after we got home we shivered and hugged the stove and could not get warm . Clyde was sick that night and the next day and Sunday . As for me , I was oddly weak and still ' . I would not quite call myself sick . On Monday morning I set out to school alone . Clyde was still not well , and the morning was very sharp . I dreaded the long walk in the cold , and for once realization was quite equal toanticipation . I was thoroughly chilled by the t hue I reached 1 he schoolhouse ; and t here N emesis met me boldly . I had been cowardly about , dismissing a negligent janitor . Now I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had to go out , cold as I was , to gather up frosty wood to build one . And when the wood was gathered , I found that the stove was too choked with ashes to receive it . I went out again and lugged in a heavy wooden bucket , weighted with remnants of the cement that had once been mixed in it . This was our ash-bucket . I filled it three times before I considered that the stove would do . And when I finally made the damp wood burn , I was feeling , not cold only , but very queer . // Queer and more queer I felt all day . By noon I knew that . I was sick ; but I had an idea that perhaps I could struggle through the afternoon session somehow . I tried it . By two o'clock I seemed to be looking at my geography class through a dense haze ; and I realized foggily that I was n't quite sure of what I was saying to them , and that I cared very little what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suddenly sat down in one of the children 's seats and admitted that I was not feeling so very well . There was an immediate , still , awed confusion in the schoolroom . I dimly saw a small girl 's terrified face and felt that I probably looked rather white and odd . Then , ' I 'll get my horse for you , ' Edward Lancaster was saying . Ile always thought of something practical ! ' You can ride home ? ' I 'd never stick on a horse , ' I owned mournfully . ' You would n ' t ? ' Edward was looking at me regretfully . I hated to disappoint him , he wanted so to help . I put my head down upon my arms and let theworld go as black as it wanted to for a minute . Then , because I knew from the hush how frightened the children were , I sat up again and tried to look intelligent . It was then that Rosie Dennen spoke . ' Walter , you go an ' hitch up Dolly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to me she said , ' Walter ' 11 take you home . ' He did . In a surprisingly short time ? considering how time dragged just then ? Walter was back with the ramshackle surrey , on the back seat of which was spread out generously a gorgeous comfort ' from the Dennen beds . Mamma had sent word that I was to be wrapped in it ; but even in the numbVOL. 119 - NO. 4 ness of the moment , I shuddered at the thought . Fin all right . I do n't need to be wrapped up , ' said I , feebly dropping clown on the seat . But when we reached the Dennen house , there was Mamma herself ready to go with me to the Vests ' , and she pulled that comfort about me with a firm hand . ' I 'm not much cold , ' I protested faintly ? in spite of the chill I was having ! And do n't take the trouble to go with me . I 'll be all right . ' I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as white as death . Are you troubled with heart t rouble ? ' I denied it . And she began to cheer me up ? if I remember correctly what I did n't much notice at the time ? with some accounts of illnesses that she had had in her family . When I had once reached t he Vests ' , and been put to bed with hot things about me , I began to revive . And when I had revived , I slept . And after I had slept , I decided that I was not in for a fit of sickness at all . I should be all right to-morrow . During the night . I revised this opinion ; and indeed I did not get to school again for a week . Of course , that was an illness hardly worth mentioning ; but have you ever been away from home and teaching your first , school far out in the country ? It was a short illness ? but oh ! the length of the crawling days when I lay in bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look like home ! I could read very little . I was alone . It was terrible ? especially after the sky clouded over and it began to rain . And after I got up , the days seemed longer than ever . I could not even sleep while sitting in a straight-backed chair at my little study table . All this is not saying that . Mrs. West was not good to me . She was tut angel of mercy . Thu trouble was with me , who did not need anybody but home folks . Two things stand out clearly from this experience . One is the call of Mrs. Dennen , who came heavily in on the day when 1 felt worst . I could not help a decided surging out of gratitude in her direction . IIer ideas of sanitation were exceedingly meagre ; but ? bless her ? she was , after all , interested in the teacher . I wished even then that she had a better schoohna'am to be interested in . The other little incident of my sickness was my terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got better . It was on Friday , I remember . I had been trying to do something to the wick of the thing , and in my ignorance of oil-stoves , I had managed matters so that neither I nor any one else could turn it either up or down . Mrs. West and I both labored valiantly over the wreck of my comfort . I , especially , worked with frantic zeal , but more and more despairingly . I had always rather despised my oil-stove , which was never a satisfactory means of heating my room ; but . how much better than nothing it seemed nowt it was a raw , bleak day of drizzling cold rain . Mr. West and Bert were out riding to bring in some poor cattle to shelter and food . I could n't tell when they would be back . Besides , it stood to reason that they could n't fix a ruined stove when they did arrive . In my despair ? it was despair , though it was only over an oil-stove ? I hysterically half resolved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there might be oil-stoves on sale . I could not sit idly by and see myself freeze . I knew that I must , in all reason , be sick again , if I tried anything so rash now ; but I could not feel that I cared much . I wanted my stove ! ? I must be warm ? a little warm ! Mr. Vest and Bert got back its time to prevent my going out in the storm . They set to with noble energy , and , after an hour or two , restored my stove to me . Its newness had forever departed ; it could never again be what it was before I tampered with it ; but it could be used ! It would burn ! When I carried the mutilated thing back into my own room , I felt a great thankfulness for the priceless boon of the oil-stove . My sickness had called my attention to two blessings . The oil-stove was one . The friendliness of the Dolmens was the other . I knew now that they were friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see , was learning , whether or not the pupils were . 11 The one definite thing that was making my whole year hard , and that made my little sickness seem so long and so woeful , was the fact that at Squaw Peak I never knew when I was going to get my mail . During the early part of my sojourn on the Verde , the situation had not been so painful . Then it was possible to send my sister into town to the post-office , whence she could arrive almost as soon as I was home from school ; or it was possible for us to ride to the Post together after my work was over . But after she left , when I very much needed mail , I could not often go for it myself in the evenings . The days were too short and cold now . And when I knew that I could not get it myself , the mail became an obsession with me. 1 used to think about it at school . There were clays when I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in hot haste down the long road to the Vests ' , to see if , perhaps , somebody had not gone to Camp Verde to-day . And when I found that no- body had , ? for the Verde-ites are a contented lot , not much excited over conditions outside of the Valley , ? what a terrible feeling of desolation used to settle down over me ! I would go savagely at my work on those nights , filling my pitchers and my lamp and my oil-stove in a spirit of animated gloom . I would look off desperately over the long , cold , brown stretches of country , feeling myself a very little prisoner in its bigness ? little and helpless and hopeless and very young ! As I have said , I was really older by several years than most girls who teach their first schools ; but I could not remember it , surrounded by these very old , very relentless mountains . Now I am newly impressed with the fact that I am not making myself out to be anything of a heroine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human , and I suppose that human , homesick girls have tried before to teach , and that they will try again . Let me go on frankly with my shameful story . The mail was an obsession . I lost no chance to get it ; and many were the adventures for which it was responsible . There was , for instance , the time when I ' rode around ' for it on Sunday with Ethel Baker . There had been a rain-storm which had sent the river booming . Nobody could cross for the mail . Nobody had been able to cross for clays . The situation was growing intolerable . And then Ethel suggested that she and I ride around ' on Sunday . We sent word to her sister in Camp Verde to get our mail from the office on Saturday , and on Sunday morning we set out . We could do this because we were really on the same side of the river as Camp Verde , but across a great bend from it . Normally we would ride about three miles each way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twice the usual distance ; and we must , besides , open a dozen gates going and the same number coming back . Since almost all of these gates were of the fatuous barbed-wire-and-pole variety , and since the roads were very muddy , this was no small task . I was not a good rider : on the slippery roads I hardly dared go out of a walk ; so we moped along monotonously for something more than two hours , I suppose , before we reached Camp Verde . The hope that was set before us buoyed us up . For myself , I was tired , of course , when we got to the Post ; but I should soon have my mail now ! We hastened to Ethel 's sister ? and found that , although she had taken Ethel 's mail from the office , she had not got mine . Did you ever have a great disappointment. ? Crown person , school-ma'am though I was , 1 greatly desired , for a. few minutes , to weep openly in the face of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my woe must have been evident . The strangers made a vigorous effort to get hold of a man who had the keys of the office . They failed , and I went wearily back over the miles of inud and gates , mail-less and melancholy . Sometimes I had real adventures when on my quests . Once , when the river had been up but was falling , I decided that I must get to the post-office after school . They told me that it would be safe if I crossed carefully and at the right spot . To impress upon me how very unsafe it might lie to cross Rio Verde at the wrong spot , they had before told me various gruesome tales of happenings along the river . There was the story of a young soldier who , before the Post . was the Post . only in name , had tried to cross the Verde during high water and had been seen no more . There was the story of a young cowboy who , only a few years before this , had been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Wests and of several other people . He had gone down suddenly into the quicksand . Some of those who watched him were unable to swim ; others lost their heads for a minute or two . He was gone when help tried to reach him . His body was never found . These stories I had heard ; but I was told now that I could cross the river without danger , if only 1 would be careful and take the Old Crossing . They insisted strongly upon that . 1 must take the Old Crossing right here below the house . There would be no danger then . rode forth a very trifle timorously in spite of the reassurances of the family ; but I must have the mail . Also , I must put in the office my own important letters . Down the lime I went , and across the tiny bridge to the little hollow at the foot of the bluff . The ninth was black and deep and shiny . Beyond , the wet sand lay quite unmarred except in one narrow track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow , as if it were uninhabited  --  newly washed up from the waters . The river tumbled by , black and angry . To take the Old Crossing I must turn from the one narrow track , and that very act gave me a feeling ofgreater loneliness . I seemed now to be blazing my way through a new country and I did not much like being a pioneer . Still , I was fully determined to obey instructions ! Brownie liked being a pioneer no better than I did ; but we traveled obediently across the smooth , wet sand into a bog of the shiny black mud I had noticed before , and on to the ford . A white cottonwood log marked the beginning of this ford  --  a bleached skeleton of a log that lay now half-drowned in the muddy water , like a dead body washed ashore . I did n't like the look of the crossing ? the water was so still and mysterious there . Neither did Brownie like it ; but we were both docile . We followed instructions and waded bravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet higher and higher on Brownie 's sides . The Water was much nearer wetting me than I liked to have it ; but we were out of the deep place at last , where Brownie stepped so gingerly , and were splashing over a long stretch of shallow water with a hard , stony bottom . And then we were on the wet , unruffled sand again , and finally on the muddy road , where I saw once more a few tracks that proved that somebody besides myself was alive in the Valley . We hurried as well as we could to the Post . The river had to be crossed again just before we entered Camp Verde ; but it was broader and shallower here , and the bottom was known to be stony all the way across . We splashed over , ? a long way it seemed , ? and as soon as I could finish my brief business and reach it again , we splashed back . Three crossings were made ! Only one more remained , and I should know myself to be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last ford before dark . In spite of all my haste , I failed . The damp twilight had faded into night as Brownie and I drew near again to the long stretch of fresh , wet sand that lay between us and the last crossing . The stars were not very bright up in heaven , and they weirdly lighted the river waters that glimmered a dull silver under them . There seemed to me something sinister in that shimmering silver . It looked too peaceful . I heard the river 's ugly voice gurgling hungrily as if demanding something . I remembered the cowboy and the poor young soldier . It was very dark . I strained my eyes , when I had reached the water 's edge , and only dimly made out the bleached skeleton log that I must head for . Then ? fearfully , I confess ? I urged the unwilling Brownie into the water . It was a long , long way across . I drew farther up on Brownie 's back , away and away from the water , and held my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning at the breakfast-table I told them how hard it had been to see the white log when I had crossed the evening before . Three men stopped eating and gazed , gasping , at Inc . ' You crossed at the white log ? ' they demanded . ' Why , yes ! ? You told me the Old Crossing ? ' I began , puzzled , feeling guilty , somehow . ' But ? that 's not the Old Crossing ! ' they denied excitedly . ' You ? you crossed at the white log ! ' They seemed stupefied by the knowledge . ' Why , yes . That 's the crossing we always have used . It 's what I call the Old Crossing ? ' ' No ! no ! ' they hurried to inform me . ' The Old Crossing ? You crossed at the white log ! Have n't you heard about the cowboy who was drowned there ? Do n't you know the river-bottom changes there with every storm ? You did n't see any tracks leading down to that crossing , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to ask me ! I could hardly remember ever having caused so much perturbation among my acquaintances . ' Sonny , ' especially , ? who had given me most of my instructions for crossing , ? kept repeating over and over , ' But I told you ? I 'm sure I must have told you ! ' And the ' white log ' kept coming in like a refrain from them all . At last they were convinced that I should never again try to use the white-log crossing in bad weather . Then they grew calm ? ready to let the matter drop . You crossed where no man would ' a ' dared cross , ' said Bert then , serenely once more . ' You were brave ? ' I was not brave . I was ignorant , ' I had the grace to admit instantly . But now that I was ignorant no more , I had a great . fear of the river when it was at all muddy and high ; and not even for the mail would I try crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . Yet my obsession did lead no into real danger at least one other time . It was nearing the end of my year . Mrs. Vest had brought Bally and the buggy to the schoolhouse for me that . afternoon ; and with their help , I was to return our borrowed books to the school across the river . Then , in spite of a blackening sky and a gusty wind , I was going to risk continuing to the Post for the mail ! To do myself justice , Mrs. West actually advised my going this time . Why , certainly I ' d go on for it , if I really wanted it , ' said she . It ' s too late in the season for storms on the Verde . If it should rain , it would n't amount to much . ' That was enough for me , of course ! I took the books home and then went on , down a not very familiar road , toward Camp Verde and the post-office . The country here was rat her more desert-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatter , more monotonous ; and I was traveling through an uncultivated section , too . There was a fence on one side for a way , but it seemed to be only a pasture fence . Inside and outside , the almost level land was dotted with a scattering growth of thin mesquite . It was all dreary enough under the darkening sky . It was indeed a darkening sky . The clouds that rolled about old Squaw Peak were taking on a hue more and 470 TUE SCHOOLMA ' AM OF SQUAW PEAK more inky every minute . And the wind was blowing ever more gust ily . I was watching the sky with an increasing nervousness now . Mrs. West had assured me that , it could n't rain in the Valley at this time of year . If I had been anywhere else , I should certainly have expected rain ? or something . As it was , I began to expect something . Now a few icy blasts came cutting down front the mountain , and with them a great stinging drop or two of rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to act for myself ; and I dived under the seat for the old umbrella she kept , there and hoisted it in the teeth of the wind . Since I was , till driving Bally , who evidently did not like the wind or the occasional lashing raindrops , this was no small task . I had hardly got . the umbrella up and its handle tucked firmly under my arm , when I began to perceive that it was going to be entirely insufficient . The cutting gusts were increasing to a gale ; the occasional drops to a clatter of pelting rain , spiced now and then with a touch of hail . I struggled clown with the mnbrella , and hauled out an old slicker which providentially reposed under the seat .. A large square had been torn from one corner of its tail , but its shoulders were intact . The wind got inside of it , paired it out like a sail , and tried to carry it . bodily out of my hands . I was decidedly nervous now . How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Bally from running away ? 1 managed it , somehow . I was inside the slicker . I had the handle of the open umbrella tightly clasped under my arm again . The umbrella itself rested low , almost on my hat . I was again sitting on the seat of the buggy with the reins in my resolute hands . Harder and harder blew the wind . Faster and faster fell the rain , More and more hail came hurtling down with it ? larger and larger stones . They battered on to my umbrella ; they whacked poor Rally 's sides like a cannonade of great . marbles . For a little I was half-blind with the storm and with sheer fright . Then , in my desperate need to act , the terror cleared away a little . The buggy was filling with ice and ice-water . Bally was shivering , balking , leaping ahead in sudden spurts when the larger stones pelted her . At last she got her back to the tempest . as nearly as she could , and , forsaking t he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would jerk at her ? almost stop her . An extra pelting of hail would set her off again . I saw the end of it in a swift vision ? the wheels of our chariot tangled in some clump of mesquite ? the buggy upset ? I , lying stiff , crumpled , in the ice-water , with the hailstones pounding me . Somehow I had got to stop Bally ! For a second I did get her stopped , huddled together in the raging storm , And then I hurled myself out over the wheel on to the plain ? a shallow lake , now , with hailstones floating in it . I was instantly wet to the knees , gasping with cold ; but I could not stop . I sprang to Bally 's bridle and caught it and held on . Somehow I kept the umbrella , too . I had a wild notion of leading my horse to the shelter of some clump of mesquite ; but she had wild notions of her own . We dragged each other back and forth for a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless bush and saw that it was worthless . Now and then she grew crazy with the beating of the stones and set off , pulling me after her . At last ? it seemed long , but I suppose it was only a short while ? we both realized the hopelessness of trying to better ourselves , and then we huddled close together and took what was coming . That lasted only a few minutes , too , I am sure . The gale swept the black clouds and the lashing storm over us . The flood of driving rain became a drizzle and then a sprinkle . The pelting stones grew fewer and fewer , and ceased . I stood there hanging to Bally 's bridle and to the umbrella , and wondered how I had escaped alive . Any one of those stones might have stunned me if it had struck me squarely . The shallow lake of the plain was afloat with them everywhere . I climbed into the buggy ? its body several inches deep in ice-water ? and headed Bally in what I thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . We reached t he road . We were near Camp Verde , I saw . Now I was very wet . My shoulders , protected by the yellow slicker , were dry ; but my shoes were soaked , my skirts , to far above my knees , were wringing wet . In spite of the umbrella , my hat was wet . It hung in a dripping straw ruffle about my face , and from its two bunches of lovely pink roses fell rosy drops of ice-water . Damp strings of hair lay against my cold cheeks . I probably looked even worse than I felt , but my spirit was up . I was not going to he downed by such trifles as my appearance and the atmospheric conditions . I had set out to Camp Verde for the mail , and to Camp Verde for the mail I went . They made rather a fuss over me in the post-office . I might have been killed , they said . It was a marvel I had n't been killed ! And my nerve ? ! Nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't nerveI I was in it and I could n't get out ! I had to stand it somehow ! ' To this day I am very glad I did n't ' collapse after it was all over , ' or desert Rally , as they suggested I might have done ; but also to this day I do wonder whether I did display much courage in this little experience ? As I said then , I was in it , and I could not get out .. I borrowed some dry clothes in Camp Verde and went , home after the dark had fallen . It was barely light enough , I remember , for me to see white foam and floating hailstones in the water at the first . crossing . I was a lit tie afraid , but I reminded myself that I was now a rural schoolteacher and that I 'd better get over some of my weaknesses . I never got . over the weakness that . led me into t he trouble . The mail continued my obsession to t he very last .. When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back over me . I can imagine myself again out on the windswept mesas , bright , with strange cactus blooms , hunting for Bally , who is somewhere in the Big Pasture ? only three miles across ! Again I can feel my throat . tighten , choking me as it . did On the night when I went to t he barnyard for a horse t hat I lutes was there , and found that Mr. West had t corned all t he creatures out . 1 can even pityingly see myself , a slim girl dragging a bridle in her hand and hurrying in the gathering Clark through the thick mesquite of t he pasture , knowing all the while that it is useless , feeling all the while that she is ridiculous , and yet , suffering all the while that hideous agony of longing that we call homesickness . Poor new rural schoolteachers ! I suppose many of them have known t he disease ? and have taught somehow in spite of it . Ili The mail was my obsession while I was at Squaw Peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cares outside of the schoolroom . The oil-stove , which I have mentioned before , was another trouble . In the first place , it was seldom satisfactory as a heater for my quarters ; but since there was no chim- ney connected with the room , it had to do its best to fill a void . On cold mornings it was very exasperating to try to keep half-warm by the thing . I fancied the icy breeze blowing up between the cracks in the floor through the thin carpet , wafting upward the slender heat of the stove , to filter through the muslin ceiling and freeze against the cold of the iron roof just beyond . Then I realized so keenly the inadequacy of my own heating plant that . I could not help feeling also a positive grudge against oil-stoves in general . I detested the things , I was sure , until that day when I though t that I had ruined mine . Then I discovered an amazing fondness for it ; and ever afterward I cherished for it what might be called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , but one that was willing to do its best . Sometimes that oil-stove 's best was not to be despised . Sometimes , late in the evening , my room grew to be really warm . I would have my large lamp lighted to aid the stove . The curtains would be drawn closely . A pan of water would stand steaming on top of the heater . Gradually I would find myself relaxing in a luxurious , blissful comfort . There was only one disadvantage connected with this delight . The same warmth that was so agreeable to me seemed equally pleasing to a family of yellow-jackets that must have lived in some loose door- or window-frame , or in the wall behind the paper . It did not add to my peace of mind when they used to come crawling or fluttering out as soon as the at mosphere grow balmy . I was afraid of them . I was afraid even to try to kill them ? until one night I stretched out my hand for some half-hidden object , and jerked it back again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute as if I had been struck by lightning ; but I finally recov ered enough to perceive that I had merely been stung on the little finger by a yellow-jacket . Him I killed ; and thereafter I slew as many as I could of his relatives . I used often to kill several of them in my room in.a single evening . I wish I had kept a record of the whole number I disposed of during my year at Squaw Peak . Yes , indeed , there were drawbacks connected with my oil-stove ! I have mentioned that it had to be filled . It consumed oil unbelievably . In the coldest weather a five-gallon can would not last me more than ten days , though I was at school , or on the way to or from school , all of five days out of seven . I was continually getting out of oil and having to borrow from the Wests . Sometimes , when the river was high , they used to get out , too ? and then I was in dire straits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of May and presumably delightfully warm and summery in the Valley . But the year of my sojourn was an unusual one , they say . It was cold ? really cold . It rained an icy rain at the river-side , and Squaw Peak was covered white with snow . I was very satirical regarding my May Day in the ever-balmy Verde . It was Saturday . Trusting to the lateness of the season , I had allowed my supply of oil to run low . Now it was stormy , very chilly ; the river was up . I was in great anguish of spirit . It seemed to me a pity to freeze to death within about three weeks of the end of my term . Had I kept alive all the year for this ? At about noon Mrs. West and I decided that it was clearing . Achill breeze swept down from Squaw Peak and parted the clouds . Doubtless they would disappear after a while ; but doubtless , also , it would still be cold . I had a letter that should be posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my precious stove . Therefore , after much gazing upward and many hesitations and changes of mind , I finally did visit the barnyard , catch the faithful , peevish Bally , saddle and bridle her , and set out , wrapped in two woolen sweaters . It had rained so much that traveling was rather hard . The roads were slippery to Bally 's feet and very disagreeable to mine when I had to dismount and struggle with gates . I had hardly started before I realized that my ride around would be less pleasant than usual . The wind continued to blow from Squaw Peak ; but instead of clearing the clouds away , it now seemed to be bringing in more of them . When I was about half a mile from the house , Squaw Peak began to be shrouded in mist . Then I could sec racing streamers of mist moving over the mountains , down onto the mesas ? nearer and nearer to me . They reached me presently . It was a fine , cold mist , varied with dashes of lively , frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that the sensible thing might be to turn back ; but I had put my hand to the plough . A certain spit eful stubbornness in Inc forbade my returning ; and I kept on , laughing grimly at myself from time to time and really enjoying myself in my usual inconsistent manner . Why was it that I always got so much fun out of the perfectly horrid situations ? Tamer hardship bored me to death . I arrived in Camp Verde exceedingly cold and clamp in spite of the two sweaters . My curious habits were becoming known . People had not yet stopped talking about my hailstorm experience . Now ? as I learned afterward ? one of the Post ladies looked from her window into the drizzle . ' I guess we 're going to have a good , smart shower after all , ' she remarked to her husband . There goes Miss Kent . ' At the post-office and general store I told my troubles and asked advice on the weather . The clerk told me that in his opinion the storm had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless ? And he departed and returned with a beautiful yellow slicker , large man 's size . It had been hanging in a stable for months and might have rats ' nests in the sleeves , Ile said ; but I was welcome to it . It was certainly welcome to me , as were the four quart bottles of coal-oil which the same obliging clerk loaded carefully on to my horse . I dried out a bit at the house of a friend and set out for the ranch against a wind that cut like a knife . It did not rain on the way home , but . I kept thinking over and over t hat I must certainly have frozen still had it not been for the yellow slicker . I had always detested the very sight of a yellow slicker before I went to Squaw Peak , Now I love them dearly still ! IV In telling the story of my year at Squaw Peak , I have dwelt most upon my experiences outside the schoolroom . That , I am afraid , is because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also because the experiences outside were more varied than those within . I hope this is part of the reason ! I do not like to believe that I had nothing of the teacher in Inc . I should like to believe now , as I wanted to believe then , that , somehow , it had been good , on the whole , for the young Squaw Peakers that I had spent a year among them . It had been good for me , I knew . I did not want to have all the good to myself . My experiences in the schoolroom had been very instructive . For one thing , I had utterly revised my views of the Little Teacher as pictured by my Institute Orator . She did need to he 474 THE SCHOOLMA'AM OF SQUAW PEAK rather a wonderful young woman ? that rural schoolma'am whom I had once thought of so lightly . I went back over my own days at Squaw Peak and remembered the meagre first equipment that had helped to set me off wrong . Before the windows had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the house . I had allowed the pupils to scurry noisily over the floor ; titer those papers . The habit of being noisy in my room was one of which I never broke my pupils . 10 that regard 1 had allowed myself to be wrecked at the outset by a mere external . The Little Teacher would not have clone this ? and I knew it . I had tried to be adaptable that year . Before the term began , some men had evidently had a spitting match in the old schoolhouse . Mrs. Dennen told me that she had removed some of the results of the contest ; but I remember vividly that after I arrived I mounted a chair and scrubbed tobacco juice from the walls above the door and between the high windows . This I tried to do with a good grace ; but I think I did not succeed in feeling very cheerful over my labor . I washed windows at the Squaw Peak School ; I struggled with a long , rusty , refractory stovepipe which had a periodic passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ janitor 's absence , ? and sometimes in his presence , ? carrying in loads of frosty wood , lugging out ashes , building fires , sweeping . I gave a few free music-lessons ; I acted , as well as I could , as a physician and surgeon in cases of accident ; I attended school faithfully , regularly , myself , in spite of furious storms and the two-mile journey through the mud ; I really tried to teach the children something when I had got there ? and yet I was not at all the speaker 's Little Teacher ! I seemed to miss the things that count . I failed to discipline children who had not been disciplined at home , and thereby left a lack in their backbones , I suppose , ? as in mine , ? at the end of the year . I loathed the filth of the Dolmen youngsters , and sometimes almost loathed them becauseof it , instead of teaching them to be clean . How I could have done that , though , I have no idea even yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often and often I lost chances through my inertia , through my own self-centredness . I was numb with homesickness . In school this should not so have been . Since it was so , the sympathy which should have existed between those country children and myself was often gone . And as to book-learning ! ? I was proud of a very few of the little tots ? and very proud . But from older children , in final examinations , after a year of my training , I got such answers as these . A member of the history class informed me that General Lee was the commander on ' our ' ( the Northern ) side during the great Civil War ; and that Cornwallis Jackson commanded on the other side . Another member of the same class suggested the name of General Wolves ' ? apparently for both positions . A great statesman 's career was thus epitomized : ' Benjamin Franklin was a poor boy . He went barefooted . He got married to Dora . ' I was informed that Maschuttes was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . And when I requested a little information regarding General Sherman , I found out simply that he had once taken a walk to the ocean . ' In geography Urazy and Yourp were mentioned as continents , and Virginia was named as ' an important western city . ' From the language-class I gathered that a ' flown is a table or a chair or a house , ' and I also learned that , while the subject of a sentence is what you are talking about , the predicate is what you are not talking about ! Yes , I know ! " These things are nothing , ' cries a whole chorus of teachers ' voices . e all have those experiences , sometimes . Why do you waste your time in commonplaces ? ' Commonplaces ! Indeed , indeed that is my own criticism of all I have written . I have told commonly the story of a common country schoolteacher 's experience in the Verde Valley of Arizona . Once I thought my adventures rather unique and picturesque . Their fancied picturesqueness and uniqueness alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peak . Now I know them to have been only the usual thing . It is entirely usual that country schoolma'ams should have inadequate equipment at school , fierce struggles with the elements outside , and loneliness and homesickness always . I had a good boarding-place with a family who are still my dear friends . I could easily have missed that . As the commonness of my story is my own criticism of it , so is it also , in my mind , its best defense . I endured nothing that every rural teacher does not , in some measure , endure . And many teachers succeed gloriously in spite of every hindrance . There are many of them . The little blue-eyed , golden-haired Miss Manchester , who taught across the river from me , is one who staved , and only one . And any girl , it seems to me , has something of the heroic in her , if she can stay , joyously , helpfully , with her task of being a rural schoolteacher . I honor them . They seem to me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came to me as the Institute Orator held forth ? ' The goodly fellowship of the prophets ' the noble army of martyrs . ' I n serious earnestness I want to describe just so this growing band ! They are so to me now ? those who teach themselves to belong in the country schools . For what do they not need ? Adaptability , sympathy unbounded , resourcefulness , courage , knowledge and such knowledge ! Not the course of study and the texts are sufficient . They ' iced to know practical sanitation and medicine , music , household arts , sewing ; and they need the gift of impart ing what they know . And they need hearts that , will not go straying home in school-hours ! Are they not truly a goodly fellowship  --  those who are succeeding ? To me they are . You will observe that I say ' they ' and not we . ' Nothing would I give for what I learned during my Squaw Peak year . All that I taught might very cheaply go .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
