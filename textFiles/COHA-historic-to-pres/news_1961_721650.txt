Soaring natural gas demand and deepening Federal regulatory confusion are periling future supplies of the versatile fuel . Although domestic producers ate continually tapping new sources , gas supplies now are rising only one-third as fast as customer demand And producers concede they 're making only half-hearted efforts to catch up They sa : % they 're discouraged and frustrated by Uncle Sam 's attempts to fix prices and otheiwise regulate the industry . Lagging exploration efforts and the industry-Government clash over regulation , al e certain to have an impact on the nation 's users of natural gas , as well as on the thousands of other Americans who are anxious to switch over to the fuel but can not now be supplied . Consumption Up 107 . In 1960 Since 1950 , more than S 5 million residential , commercial and industrial consumers have changed over to gas heating from other types of fuels , lifting the total to 32 5 million In 1960 alone gas consumption spurted more than 10 ' 1 , over the preceding year . And industry officials say the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply in 1915. now amount to about a 21-year cushion . This is dangerously near the 20-year oi minium reserve that pipelines and utilities which ci , stribute the gas bought from producers . figure they must have to justify costly expansion of their own facilities Producers , nonetheless , are showing no signs of sharply accelerating their exploration and development programs any time soon . Even a transfusion of funds from surplustroubled oil operations to gas well drilling by some companies has been of little help . And producers are selling an increasing share of gas from new reserves to customers within producing states , usually far from areas of greatest demand , to avoid Federal regulation of interstate operations . In an effort to placate producers and encourage them to step up exploration , the Federal Power Commission has recently adopted a new approach to setting gas prices . It is aimed at breaking up a snarl of producer rate cases which the commission has estimated would have taken more than S3 years to untangle under its previous sytem . Many Producers Skeptical At first , industry officials thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing districts might finally get things moving again . But now , after detailed study of the complex pricing policy , many producers are growing increasingly skeptical and their corporate plans reflect their hesitancy to step up drilling activity . Essentially , under the new area pricing approach , standard prices for gas at the wellhead are set for all producers in a specific district who sell gas to consumers outside their own state  --  one price for existing contracts , another for new contracts . The price for new contracts is higher than the price set for existing contracts . The F P.C. contends the higher price on new contracts should encourage exploration , while consumers would benefit to some extent from the prices set for existing contracts . While consumers may wind up paying somewhat more under existing con tracts than they had before , their price still would be below the level for new contracts Previously , the F.P.C. applied cost-of-service standards like those used in setting utility rates to determine the price for each contract The commission says this method proved " unrealistic " and " unworkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major producing areas , however , are not stimulating industry activity , producers report . Dissatisfied with prices in their district , many producers say they 'll press for higher rates when the F.P.C. begins holding price hearings in each area in coming months The first such hearing is scheduled for March 6 in Midland , Texas . " Area pricing can not be considered a permanent and complete solution of the industry 's pricing problems , " says W. J. Goldston of Houston , president of the Mid-Continent Oil &; Gas Association . " Even if we assume that the commission 's area price policy will be upheld by the courts , the fact remains that we are faced with interminable delays , legal harassment and judicial uncertainties while awaiting a final decision . And the industry can ill afford another period of uncertainty of the kind it has been subject to since 1951 . " A Price Freeze ? Producers say they 're worried that area pricing may become a long-term price freeze . They 're also troubled by what they claim is discrimination against producers on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion . Now we 've got organized confusion . " quips J. W. Cutbirth vice president of General Crude Oil Co. , Houston . Producers also say they 're no nearer to resolving some continuing regulatory headaches For instance , they insist they 're as much in the dark as ever over what data the commission wants them to present in seeking a certain gas price . Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that President-elect John F. Kennedy will have the opportunity to name tin ce new member s to the five-man Federal Potter Commission in the next few months Producers speculate this changeover might result in the commission ON erturning area pricing or altering its application A report on Federal regulatory agencies recently submitted to Mr Kennedy by James M. Landis , newly-named Presidential assistant , is highly critical of area pricing . For the 125 interstate pipelines and more than 1,200 utilities that have invested about $22 billion in transmission and distribution systems for natural gas , producer discontent means a continuing problem in obtaining new sources of supply . Industry officials agree this is likely to slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting lists for gas service . " The only way people can get more gas for less is through free competitive enterprise . " insists Paul Taliaferro , president of Sunray Mid  --  Continent Oil Co. , Inc. , Tulsa . " As ' long as the Government sees fit to interfere with this process , consumers are going to end up getting less or paying morb , or both . " To prevent stocks from falling below a 15-year supply by 1970 , even with a sharp rise in gas imports from Canada and Mexico , U.S. producers would have to drill an average of 82,500 oil and gas wells-a year over the next 10 years , estimates David T. Searls , vice president and general counsel of Gulf Oil Corp. , Pittsburgh . That compares with a 1960 rate of only 46,750 wells . With a world surplus putting a lid on the price of crude oil , and the ' Federal Government holding down the price of gas , producers are not likely to have sufficient funds available to'Support a 62,500-wells-a-year drilling program , Mr. Searls contends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will furnish the incentive for this tremendous expenditure of money by the producers , there is only one . alternative , and that is , the consumers must switch to ether fuels for , their increase in demand , " he says . " They can not hide their heads in the sand and say they want the supply but do not want any increase in price . " Gas From Oil Wells Total supply is n't always deliverable supply , producers also warn . They note that as a gas field gets older , it takes longer to recover remaining reserves , resulting in a lower producing rate . What 's more , they add , about one-third of U.S. gas production comes from oil wells , which are subject to tight output restrictions in most major producing states : Further reducing supplies available for interstate markets is a steady rise in intrastate sales  --  distribution of gas in the same state in which it is produced . Nearly one-third of the nation 's 8,000 natural gas producers sell no gas to interstate pipelines , and those that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrastate uses as petrochemical manufacture , industrial or power plant fuel and local utility distribution .. " Despite ' the area pricing decision , producers still look more favorably on intrastate gas contracts because these avoid all the red tape and uncertainty of interstate sales , " reports John F. Camp , Jr. , independent San Antonio producer . Nearly half of the gas produced in Texas , which accounts for , about 48% of total U.S. output , is being consumed within the state . Phillips Petroleum Co. , the nation 's largest gas producer , is using about one-fourth of its vast production in its own operations . Scores of companies are operating " cycling plants " which strip valuable natural gas liquids ( generally bringing higher prices than crude oil ) from " wet " natural gas , then return the " dry " gas ? to the underground reservoir to await better gas prices . Combining Two Uses Humble Oil So Refining Co. ; chief domestic subsidiary of Standard Oil Co . ( New Jersey ) , recently completed a $68 million project that Combines two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest cycling plant , located on the King Ranch in south Texas , strips gas liquids from 545 million cubic feet of gas a day ; then a .238-mile intrastate pipeline network carries dry gas to industilal customers along the Gulf Coast of Texas . Another potentially large market exempt from . Federal price regulation could be developing : Purchase of gas in the field by utilities for use in other states . The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on whether the F.P.C. can legally block transportation of gas purchased in Texas by Consolidated Edison Co. for transmission by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. to one of Con Edison 's New York City electric generating plants . The F , P.C. is not seeking to set prices on the gas , but has rejected a request by Transco to build additional pipeline facilities to cary the gas on the grounds that the proposed end use or the gas  --  as boiler fuel=is " an inferior one . " The F.P.C. also was confronted recently with a similar , but more complex , transaction . Humble , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , signed a 20-year agreement to sell an estimated $300 million worth of gas in south Texas to Southern California Edison Co . The California utility plans to move the gas to its Los Angeles area power plants via Mexico , utilizing a $225 million , 1,600-mile pipeline system to be built by Tennesses Gas Transmission Co. and Petroleos Mexicans , the Mexican government 's oil agency . Shipment yin Mexico By exporting the gas from Texas , carrying it across northern Mexico and importing it again In California , the utility may avoid Federal controls . The F.P.C. , however , must rule on requ'ests for export and import permits by Tennessee Gas and Southern California Edison . The industry 's pricing troubles really begin with the very nature of natural gas : Considered more accursed than a dry hole by early drillers , natural gas generally was burned off at the wellhead or the well was closed . When large Interstate markets opened up for gas after World War II , supply so exceeded demand that huge reserves were committed under long-term contracts , for extremely low prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the Phillips Petroleum case of 1954 that the F.P.C. had authority to regulate wellhead prices of gas sold in interstate commerce . The result has been mass confusion in the industry , with thousands of producers literally not knowing what price they will eventually receive for gas they have been delivering to pipelines for years . For example , about $170 million in annual gas revenues now being collected under more than 3,300 pending interstate contracts is being held in escrow , with producers subject to making refunds , plus 6% interest , for any portion of charges not approved in the F.P.C. 's final decision in each case . " If the new area pricing policy permits us to know in advance what price we 'll get for our gas , it 'll be quite an improvement , " says Douglas Whitaker , Shreveport , La. , independent producer . " It 's discouraging to put a price under escrow . You tie up your money and never know if you 'll get it or not . That 's money you ca n't put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This decision ( the area pricing formula ) could relieve producers of 80% to 90% of the burden of cases we formerly had to argue before the F.P.C. , " estimates John M. Kelly , president of Elk Oil Co. , Roswell , N. Mex. , which receives about 60% of its income from natural gas . " On those cases that are n't worth fighting through the commission , we 're in effect trading a lower-price for elimination of red . tape . " ? Some producers , however , question that area pricing will make much of a dent in the commission 's huge backlog of producer rate cases . The director of natural gas operations for one major oil company reports that his statistics indicate that most of the cases pending before the F.P.C. involve prices one to six cents per thousand cubic feet higher than the area ceiling . He predicts that'most producers will insist on individual hearings rather - than settle for a lower price . Even where prices sought are no higher than the F.P.C. 's area ceilings , individual hearings may be required by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington . D.C. , recently rejected two F.P.C. price decisions for lack of evidence to justify the higher prices , although in each case the price approved did not exceed the area ceiling .
