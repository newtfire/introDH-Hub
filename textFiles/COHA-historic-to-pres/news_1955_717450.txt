Powerful Senate Democrats have agreed in principle on the main program for the second session of the Eighty-fourth Congress . This session will open in January in a Presidential election year . They are ready to offer a complex of legislation somewhat more liberal in general tone than what was offered in the last session , but liberal mainly in such traditional areas as farm relief and flood controL There is every intention - to avoid , if possible , such issues as compulsory civil rights bills ? for Federal sanctions against racial discrimination in hiring and so on  --  and repeal or basic alteration of the Taft-Hartley Labor Act . Debate in these fields , if pursued to anything resembling ultimate tests , would split the party and reopen the old rupture between its Northern and Southern wings . One of the great efforts of the session , in fact , will be an attempt by the Democratic hierarchy to restrain the party liberals lrom insisting on action in such matters as these . Flood Control To Be Urged Otherwise , the Democratic program will involve innovations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left and center of the Republican as well as the Democratic party and to be unacceptable only to the right-wing of each . For example , there will be an omnibus Democratic bill , involving possibly as much as $3,000 , - 600,000 in Federal outlays , for a national flood control plan . The Democra , ts reckon that this will appeal first of all to the Northeast , which has been hand hit by , floods recently , but some assistance will be proposed for every area of the country . There also will be a Democratic bill for Federal aid to public school construction , Such a measure remained inert in a Democratic - controlled Senate committee in the last session of Congress . This time the word will be passed that it is to be an absolute " must . " Apart from these items , the Democratic program may be thus described authoritatively : 9A new approach to a Federal highway program , a matter on which the Democrats and the Ei- ' senhower Administration fought inconclusively in the last session . The new approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more to come later , in Federal assistance for road improvements . 9Renewed attempts to cut individual income taxes . Many believe that the likely result of this effort will be an increase from $600 to $700 in the individual income tax ' exemptions . qLiberalization of the farm subsidy , which the Administration was able to reduce two years ago by replacing high , rigid farm price supports with a flexible system . The outlook on the farm proposal is conceded by influential Democrats to be rather obscure . A Democratic estimate is that if the President personally and strongly enters the fight , he may well defeat the plans of many Democrats and a good many farm state Republicans in Congress to return to the old high support of 90 per cent of parity on basic commodities . Parity is a formula intended to give the farmer prices for his , products having a favorable relationship to the prices he must pay for what he buys . The Democratic policy , however , is based on the assumption that at worst the party will be able to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are significant defections in the Senate among the prairie state Republicans , it will be possible to go the whole way back to 90 per cent . qLiberalization of Social Security both in old age pensions and in the benefits given to survivors of the participants in the system . G. 0 . P. Competition Expected Muth of this basic Democratic program will , of course , run immediately into the fact that the Administration itself has been and no doubt will be offering similar recommendations of its own . The Democratic strategy is based on the postulate that while most of the achievements of Congress in the long run will , without doubt , be substantially bipartisan , the party in control at the Capitol will nevertheless be able to claim a large share of the credit . Some Democrats concede that this hope could not be strongly held if President Eisenhower were running in 1956 at the head of the Republican ticket . Since the general assumption is that he will not seek re-election , the Democratic estimate is that whoever replaces him on the ticket can not successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
