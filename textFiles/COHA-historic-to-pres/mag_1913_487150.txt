Dickens is naturally among the novelists brought out for the holiday season . Of the quarto " Old Curiosity Shop " ( Doran , $5 net ) the distinguishing feature is the illustrations in color by Frank Reynolds , R I. It is not every novel that admits of being elaborately illustrated to the satisfaction of those who treasure their own mental images of its characters , and when the thing does admit of being done , there are still a hundred ways of going astray in the execution . But Dickens 's story of Little Nell , and her grandfather , and Sampson Brass , and Sally Brass , and Quilp , and Dick Swiveller is precisely of the kind which good pictures can not hurt ; and Mr. Reynolds has made capital ones  --  at once good to look at and chiming in with our notion of the characters .

Dodd , Mead &; Co. have issued her " Wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of 641 pages , with many illustrations . The print is small , but remarkably clear . There is an interesting analytical and critical preface by Thomas Seccombe , sketching and estimating Mrs Gaskell 's literary career as a whole , but devoted chiefly to this work . " The characters , " says Mr. Seccombe in closing , " are as difficult as ever novelist attempted , the success as great as ever novelist achieved " Very slender are the princesses and much bewigged are their suitors in Kay Nielsen 's illustrations of the fairy tales which , retold by Sir Arthur quiller-Couch , form the text of the happily named volume , " In Powder and Crinoline " ( Doran ) . Sir Arthur complains of a plentiful lack of fairy stories of the age of crinoline , but has made shift to find three , including one of his own .

Two essays , believed to be hitherto unpublished , one by Charles Dudley Warner and the other by Walt Whitman , are put forth by the Carteret Book Club of Newark in editions limited to one hundred copies . Warner 's essay is a short appreciation of Charles Dickens , of whom it remarks that half an hour " is worth a lifetime of his self-conscious analyzers " Whitman begins his essay , which is on " Criticism , " by suggesting that he may be going to write upon something that does not exist .

There are sixteen plates in full color , besides numerous marginal designs . ThoUgh not distinguished , the heroic couplets in which the legend is told move for the most part smoothly . From the same publishers comes a new edition of the " Rutaiyat " ( $1 50 net ) , in less expensive style than that issued by them two years ago . Though the size of the page has been slightly decreased and the weight of the paper reduced , the new edition has been printed from the same plates as the more elaborate volume , and has the same number ' of illustrations ( twenty-four ) in full color .

Another book of verse is Robert W. Service 's songs of travel and adventure and sentiment , well named " Rhymes of a Rolling Stone " ( $2 net ) , which has been brought out by Dodd , Mead with photographic reproductions of many of the scenes described or alluded to . The first poem tells the story of the book : There 's sunshine in the heart Of me , My blood sings in the breeze ; The mountains are a part of me , I 'm fellow to the trees .

For those who do not know the " Maltres d'Autrefois " in the original this English version may be recommended . ASSYRIAN RELIGION . Die Religion Babylontens and Assyriens . Von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred Tcipelmann . In 1898 Professor Jastrow published Ms " Religion of Babylonia and Assyria , " in a series of handbooks on the History of Religion edited by him . In 1902 appeared the first part of a translation of this work into German , under the title , " Die Religion des Babyloniens and Assyriens , " a somewhat unusual experience for an American author . In the announcement accompanying the first part of this translation , the complete work was promised in ten parts within a year , revised by the author and brought up to date . As the work progressed this original plan was changed several times , until at last , after eleven years , we have three bulky volumes , together with a portfolio of illustrations , containing in all some 1,800 pages against less than 800 pages in the original . As the pages in the German are considerably larger than those in. the English volume , the new German work may be said to be , in the matter of text , three times as large as the original English work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only difference between the two books . The last seven chapters , or about one-half of the original English work , dealing with cosmology , myths and legends , future life , temples and ritual , and containing finally a general summing up , are altogether omitted from the German volume , which , in spite of its larger size , is therefore as yet a torso . Dr. Jastrow attempts to present an exhaustive treatment of the omen and magical literature of the Babylonians . Through the first fourteen chapters the difference in contents and in size between the two books is not great-252 pages in the English to 272 pages in the German . It is when he begins to deal with the magical texts that the change takes place . The result is that the book is strangely out of proportion . The first 272 pages , constituting the first half of the first volume , are Part of a handbook of the history of the religion , like the original English edition . The remaining two volumes and a half are , in continually increasing ratio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magical texts , prayers and hymns , penitential psalms , and more especially oracles and omens of every description , particularly the omens derived from the examination of the liver and the study of the heavens . As might be expected from the length of time consumed in this immensely painstaking work , with the constant addition of new material as a result of excavations in progress , or new discoveries in old material through decipherment of texts theretofore unknown , Professor Jastrow has undergone various changes of opinion in the process of publication . The pages dealing with the history and relation of the various forms of wedge-shaped writing , in the earlier part of the work , had to be rewritten later , and , similarly , the views first expressed with regard to the Sumerian language , which Professor Jastrow did not believe existed , were changed and modified later , the proof of the existence of that language having become too convincing for him longer to refuse to accept it . With all the wealth of material which he has presented , Dr. Jastrow yet finds himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially a treatise on the Elamite language by Dr. Husing , omitted for lack of space , and specimens of purely Sumerian hymns and penitential songs . The latter omission he promises to repair in another work , which is to treat also the material covered in the latter chapters of the original English volume , not included in the present book . We wish , by the way , that in his preface the author had followed Anglo-American rather than German custom , and omitted altogether Polemical references to his critics . Naturally , the relatively disproportionate space allotted in this book to the discussion of omen literature gives the reader the impression that this was the real content of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion , and , in point of fact , in ordinary practice , magic did constitute , during a considerable part of its history certainly , the religion of Babylonia-Assyria , as it did of Egypt . This is evidenced by the great mass of this literature which has been handed down to us . Dr. Jastrow has deserved well of scholars , especially by his study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already been noted in the columns of the Nation as the different parts of the work were issued . To many students , however , and to readers in general , the most interesting and valuable part of this whole publication will prove to be the " Bilden mappe zur Religion des Babyloniens and Assyriens , " a portfolio of pictures dealing with or in any way illustrating Babylonian religion , 226 illustrations in all , with about 100 pages of text . As in the case of the omen literature , Professor Jastrow has sought to make this pictorial representation of Babylonian-Assyrian religion exhaustive , and he has , in fact , assembled here , if not all , at least all of importance , from the monuments of various sorts , including the seal cylinders . We note a few places in which the collection might have been enlarged to advantage , especially the parts dealing with the temples and ziggurats , and with burial and the future life . In some cases , also , the pictures lack clearness ; but , on the whole , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text accompanying the pictures is , in general , a sane and helpful interpretation of their meaning . The illustrations from the seal cylinders were selected by Dr. William Hayes Ward , who also wrote the text accompanying . With these explanations and with Dr. Ward 's general view of the Babylonian religion and its relation to neighboring cults , we do not find ourselves always able to agree . On page 105 he says : " The genuine Babylonian art nas carefully avoided everything obscene , " and he accordingly refers the figures of naked goddesses upon the cylinders to northern , particularly Hittite , influence , or ascribes the cylinders to other than Babylonian sources . In point of fact , sexual representations are extremely common in the figurines found in the temples of southern and middle Babylonia in the very earliest period . Indeed , the temples are full of sexual symbols , both male and female , in the earliest period very crude and literal , and gradually assuming conventionalforms . One does not need , after examining the remains found in these temples , to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual cult was very pronounced in the Babylonian religion . We think there is more of it on the cylinders than Dr. Ward has realized , although there is less there than in the images and figures to which we have referred . This is not the sort of thing that can be published in extenso , and Dr. Jastrow wisely exhibits very little of it in his pictures . He does , however , recognize its existence in the religious art . The last volume is provided with most elaborate indices , including a dictionary covering in all almost 150 pages . They represent a colossal industry . One curious geographical error should he corrected in any future edition . The procession of the gods , in plate 98 , is described as : " Grosse Felsenskulptur zu Malatia in Anti-Taurusgebirge . " The real place is Maltai , about thirty miles due north of Mosul . CURRENT FICTION . Here Are Ladies . By James Stephens . New York : The Macmillan Co . Mr. Stephens is a poet , and so declared himself by issuing two volumes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he showed mastery of humorous and imaginative prose . That was an unusual book , and the critic could only vaguely range it with " Alice in Wonderland " and " The Water Babies " ? which is to say , very much above and beyond books merely conventional or merely clever . " Here Are Ladies " is almost as unusual . The short papers here collected are not quite stories  --  certainly not " short stories " in the American sense . They are " sketches " rather , scenes and situations presented on their own merits , as Maupassant , for example , often thought them worth presenting . These sketches arrange themselves for the most part in triads , as " Three Heavy Husbands , " " Three Women Who Wept , " " Three Happy Places , " and so on . In most of them Mr. Stephens plays with the perennial subjects of romancer and satirist , women and marriage . But his play is mirthful , seldom merely facetious , and never merely bitter ; his humor is that of a poet masking as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages , like certain episodes in " The Crock of Gold , " may shock " the gentle reader , " but their extravagance is ( to compare small things with great ) that of Rabelais rather than that of Swift . A deep vein of romantic feeling underlies all this display of cynicism , and craps up in the intercalary verses which offer so sharp a contrast , on the surface , to the prose text . Mr. Stephens deals with types rather than persons . For example , the first of his " heavy husbands " is the silent man . Having thoughtlessly exposed himself to matrimony , he looks forward to the wedding ceremony as the beginning of a lifetime of conversation : It lay , therefore , that he must amend his own hand , and , accordingly , for the purpose of marital intercourse , he began a sad inquiry into the nature of things .

" that window is square , it is made of glass , " or , " the roof of this carriage is flat , it is made of wood . " Suddenly his wife buried her face in her muff , and her shoulders were convulsed . . . . Love and contrition possessed him on the instant . He eased his husky throat , and the dreaded , interminable conversation began ? " What are you crying for , my dear ? " said he . Her voice , smothered by the fur , replied : " I am not crying , darling , " said she ; " I am only laughing . " Perhaps the real charm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a man 's book ; a book free of the drawing-room conventions , decent or indecent , which now obsess our fiction ; a book with the free and hearty voice of one honest man speaking to another in his shop or at his club . Pelle the Conqueror : Boyhood . By Martin Anderson Nexb . Translated from the Danish by Jessie Muir . New York : Henry Holt &; Co . When this first of the four Parts of this novel appeared some seven years ago , its author was hardly known even in little Denmark . Now he is famous there ; and as his work has the sturdy human quality , which is of all qualities most likely to weather the risks of translation , we see no reason why he may not reach a world-wide audience . He writes from his heart and his experience . Like his hero , he fought his way up from the humblest origin and the least promising conditions to a place of dignity and influence . Pelle is the conqueror , because he is born , and never ceases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Pelle , passed his boyhood on the prosperous little island of Bornholm in the Baltic , where work and fair pay offered themselves to the starving farm laborers of Sweden and Denmark . Pelle is hardly more than a child when his old father brings him to Bornholm . They find a foothold upon one of the larger farms , and there , how ever precariously , they stick throughout Pelle 's boyhood . Stone Farm is a little world in itself ; we hardly step beyond it in the course of these pages . The master , Kongstrup , is a big , thriving , earthy fellow , kind enough to his men , but a devastator among women . Life at Stone Farm involves much of the savagery , the - wreaking of primitive emotions , which our newspapers gloat over , and our novelists ( perhaps wisely ) ignore . This writer neither gloats nor glozes over the simple facts of rural life , as he has learned them from experience .

Pelle , the young and strong , loves him . Their parting , when the time comes for Pelle to set out upon his great adventure , wrings them both , almost speechless though it be . Pelle held out his hand " Good-by and thank you , father  --  for all your kindness ! " he added gently . " Yes , yes ; yes , yes ! " said Lasse , shaking his head . It was all he was able to say .

It is hard to see why the author chose the coal fields of Derbyshire as his setting , and for his hero the son of a miner , unless , indeed , he wished to imply that the free thinking and free living of a certain fashionable London society have penetrated , like the tango and the victrola , to the lower classes The story Will leave a gloomy impresion on most readers . It is too strongly grasped And wrought out to be negligible , and will force many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true picture . As to the general background , there can be no question that the writer has his eye on the object Life in the Morel household , hard as it is , is no more severe than an occasional miner 's wife has to contend with . Mrs. Morel is obliged not only to wring enough from her hard-drinking husband to make both ends meet , but to bear him children in rapid succession ; and the early chapters also relate her struggle to maintain the ideals to which before marriage she has been accustomed . In this battle lies the book 's real charm and pathos . The mother 's relation to her children , especially two sons , is described with the firm knowledge that brings conviction . The second son , Paul Morel , is the central character of the story . Having learned to paint , though he continues in a clerkship throughout the book , he is promptly endowed by the author with all the heartache expected of great genius . He loves Miriam , the attractive daughter of a farmer , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he claims her body , and , passion having cooled , is convinced that his soul requires pastures new . He has a similar and more extended relation with a young married woman living apart from her husband , and again interprets the vicissitudes of physical desire in spiritual terms . At length his mother dies , after long-drawn-out suffering with cancer ; rather , her actual end is accomplished by him by means of an overdose of morphia , intended , one must believe , not only to relieve her anguish , but his own as well . Then nothing is left for him . Miriam offers to marry him , but he refuses , and walks forth into the night . Paul 's " affairs " are the indulgence of an egotist , whose egotism has no large transforming power . " LABBY . " The Life of Henry Labouchere . By Algar Labouchere Thorold . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . $4.50 net . This is a book of varied and sustained interest , but somehow fails to he completely satisfying . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A life that was , in some senses , iiianqud , does not go ill with a biography that here and there is broken and disappointing . The work is full and conscientious , though occasionally marred by carelessness ; it is quite without hero-worship or family pride ; but it is a thing of sections and glances rather than a consistent and unified whole . But so , too , was Labouchere . Mr. Thorold quietly assumes that he was " the greatest English wit since Sheridan . " This might be challenged on several grounds . It would be like " Lab-by " to challenge it by remarking that Sheridan was Irish and Labouchere was French . Such he indubitably was not only by descent but by cast of mind and aptitude of expression . The crisp turn of his epigrams and paradoxes reached London by way of the Seine . One of them is well said to be inconceivable as coming from lips right English . It was his saying of a Parliamentary colleague ? Bradlaugh , of course  --  that " the mere denial of the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken without scrutiny on matters of greater importance . " This is one of the Class of utterances which led some to dub Labouchere Voltairian . The resemblance is not thoroughgoing . But the quality of whimsical cynicism was bred in his French blood . He began to be audacious with his tongue in boyhood , and kept it up until almost literally the day of his death . A few hours before his end at Florence , an attendant upset a spirit-lamp by his bedside . Labouchere was startled out of his comatose condition , noted the glow , and said , " Flames ? Not yet , I think , " and quizzically laughed himself off to sleep . It recalls the Talleyrand story of the " souffrances de l'enfer " and " Quoi , d  --  jff ? " Labouchere warmed his hands at many different fires of life . He was fond of travel , dabbled at the diplomatic career a few years , until his superiors could no longer put up with his freakish impudence ; was for a time in Mexico , thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heaven knows what he would have said about us  --  was theatrical manager , Journalist , Radical member of Parliament , and free lance in all . His escapades were as numerous as his witticisms . Both were doubtless fathered upon him , after the fashion of giving such things to him that hath . He himself had an embroidering memory ; some of his early adventures , as he loved to recount them in smoking-rooms or write them out in Truth , lost nothing in the frequent retelling . Many of them are set forth in these pages , and make amusing reading . They have been quoted endlessly ? especially his retorts and verbal quips , which we are asked to believe were never stair-case wit . But , indeed , the evidence is ample that Labouchere was extraordinarily ready , as he was amazingly adroit . And his manner is said to have been perfect . His whimsicalities were uttered with quiet deliberation , and his most terrifying audacities were accompanied by an air of bland simplicity . This no doubt helped to give him his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were less attended to than his guerrilla interventions in debate . In the latter he was unexcelled for airy banter , for witty characterization , and for deft puncturing of pomposity . The points at which Labouchere touched public life are clearly indicated by the author . As part proprietor of the Daily News , Labouchere found himself in Paris in 1870 , sent away the regular French correspondent , himself stayed through the siege and got out his letters by balloon . His work as observer and reporter was capital and brought him deserved fame . The other journalistic repute  --  if such it was  --  which he won was as owner and editor of Truth . Its present editor , Mr. Bennett , furnishes a chapter detailing Labouchere 's insouciant connection with that picturesque toy  --  for such the publication long was to him . That a thing which he took up for amusement came to bring him in a good deal of money which he did not need , only added to the piquancy of the experience . His best labor he long gave to politics , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Party interest reached its highest in him about 1886 , when he was doing his best to persuade Chamberlain to support Irish Home Rule and thereafter make himself Radical Prime Minister . The letters which passed between the two at that crisis are of more historical interest than anything else in the volume . We see here that Chamberlain was nearer than had been supposed to agreeing to a modified Irish bill . But at the last moment he shied off , and Labouchere never forgave him . Nor did he ever expect again to live to see a Radical party triumphant . This was his greatest political disillusion . Next to it came Gladstone 's refusal to invite him into the Cabinet in 1880 , and Rosebery 's to send him as Minister to Washington . The reasons are not very clearly given . Probably the deepest one was that Labouchere was not really taken by the English as a serious man . This is not to say that he was not sincere . Yet for a man born rich , a cosmopolitan , a professed wit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little too ffiuch for the ordinary Englishman . He could not help suspecting a pose . He joined in the chuckles provoked by the man , yet , after all , could not get over thinking of him as " Our Labby . " So it was that the highest ambitions were necessarily frustrated . Yet Labouchere was not embittered . He kept a brave and smiling front to the world . Nor was his final retirement to Florence a retreat . Buying Michael Angelo 's villa , he turned it inside out with refittings , observing that " old Michael knew nothing about the comforts of a modern establishment , and it was time that he should learn them " There he passed his last years , surviving , in a way , his own reputation , but kept warm to the end by enduring friendships . Our Eternity . By Maurice Maeterlinck . Translated by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos . New York : Dodd , Mead &; Co. $1.50 net . The good fortune of Maeterlinck in his translators continues undiminished : an English Maeterlinck , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fluid , and undulant prose of Mr. Alexander Teixeira de Mattos 's version of " La Mort , " now republished in a revised and much enlarged edition ; for the grisly title , " Death , " the grandiose " Our Eternity " ( Dodd , Mead ) has been substituted . Maeterlinck opens his argument by distinguishing the moment of death , the artioulus mortis , from its formidable concomitants and environs , sickness , physical corruption , and retributive torment  --  discriminations logically sound , but put forth with a little more complacence than belongs properly to the mere act of " rectifying the frontiers " of a definition . In a chapter partly derived from a former essay , " L'Immortalite , " he proceeds to demonstrate the unlikelihood of the permanent survival of the ego ; the eternization of that trickle of memory in which he finds the frail and insubstantial nucleus of the ego impresses him as unreasonable . The logic in this section is subtle and astute , though , in deprecation of the emphasis on memory , a critic might suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much continuity as proprietorship , the warmth and intimacy Celebrated by William James , and that the difficulty in dissociating the two is a mere accident of our temporal existence . The new chapters , deal with theosophy , psychical research , and reincarnation . Maeterlinck 's expertness in dialectic is really remarkable in a master of intuition , and his perfect craftsmanship is shown in the ease with which he adapts the spare and meagre syllogism  --  so prone , from Euclid to Macaulay , to the use of detached , staccato forms  --  to the sweep of his own flexible and vibrant periods . His wariness in the matter of so-called manifestations is truly admirable , and will surprise only those who have failed to consider that the mystical imagination , which is his prime faculty , is adverse to that appetite for signs and tokens which drives the unimaginative to seances suggestive of the recognition scenes at the winding-up of a Plautine or Terentian comedy . There is an amenity in Maeterlinck 's incredulity that is almost without precedent ; the burly , aggressive skepticism of Huxley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the genuinely humane , the winning , caressing skepticism that emanates from Saint Wandrille is almost a literary novelty . The author notes that spirits are loquacious as to the old life , but reticent as to the new , and doubts if experiment has educed any facts inexplicable by the aid of telepathy , clairvoyance , and suggestion . There follow two curious chapters on The Two Aspects of Infinity and Our Fate in these Infinities , in which the old distinction between being and becoming , the resting and the flowing universe , is expounded With an eloquence which , in its common leaning towards the sidereal and the metaphysical infinite , recalls the speculations of Plotinus . In these roamings of the adventurous imagination on the high seas of thought , Maeterlinck shows the enterprise , the zest , the controlled exultation , of the true explorer , and his inability to find a port ( a failure which evokes in him an austere joy ) provides new occasions for the exhibitions of his seamanship . It is hardly to be wondered at if , in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergo that submergence which he foresees for the human personality . In the final chapter , Conclusions , after hesitating between the two theories of a consciousness modified beyond recognition , even self-recognition , and absorption in the cosmic consciousness , Maeterlinck inclines very tentatively to the latter . In the one point in which he manifests a premature and indiscreet certainty , his temperament has got the better of his logic . He insists that in this new existence we can not be unhappy , since we should be parts of infinity , and a self-torturing infinite is inconceivable . The fortitude that enables the universe to put up with the toothaches and heartaches in the section of infinity known as earth is left without explanation . The book as a whole will consolidate , if it does not raise , the reputation of its author . The presumptions of fragility and tenuity in the thought which a hasty reasoner might deduce from the aerial and exquisite style are not verified by a scrutiny of the logic .

" The world of Boston , when I opened my eyes upon it , " writes Senator Lodge in the course of what he hints is the first instalment of an autobiography , " was a very small and simple world as I look back at it now in the glare and noise of the twentieth century . There was an abundance of gayety , but expenditures were small . Everybody knew everybody else and all about everybody else 's family . Most people were related , for in the small colonial communities of the eighteenth century the established families had intermarried in a manner most bewildering even to the trained genealogist .

Three pages are required to express Senator Lodge 's abhorrence of the excessive magnanimity of some Northerners , who in their zeal virtually confess the justice of the position of the South in the Civil War . The expansion in the size and power of fortunes also is a text for a long discussion ; and the hurry of our time , with its consequences for the art of letter-writing and form in general , distresses the Senator greatly . It is all the more interesting , therefore , to come upon a note which an Englishman , Henry Greville , made in his diary in 1858 , when the future United States Senator was eight years old Wrote Greville : " An amusing letter from Fanny Kemble , dated Nahant , U. S. ( a favorite sea-bathing place near Boston ) , received to-day , says : ' How You would open your eyes and stop your ears if you were here ! This enormous house is filled with American women , one prettier than the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entretennes , behave like housemaids , and scream like peacocks . ' " This is sufficient evidence of Senator Lodge 's Judicial attitude towards the era of his childhood , and , indeed , he expressly denies being a laitdator temporis acti . Yet a reader of a book of reminiscences may be forgiven for wishing a maximum of memories and a minimum of moralizing . Of memories , there are , nevertheless , a goodly supply , and of a character for which one must be grateful . Although the story stops with its narrator 's entrance into public life , its continuance so far is enough to include a list of famous names like- those of Rufus Choate , Evarts , Sumner , Phillips , Gov . Andrew , Motley , Parkman , Bancroft , Longfellow , Lowell , Holmes , and Emerson . Not all of the best anecdotes are about the immortals . It was Dr. Bigelow , for instance , who was suggested by Lodge 's father as the final court of appeal , when Lodge and some of his youthful friends , having announced their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found that their notions of the proper time for violent exercise ran counter to those of their elders . The boys went to the doctor , and put their question . He looked at them with a quizzical smile , and said : " I should not do it myself , but nothing hurts boys . " Yes , you may go in . " Sure enough , no evil results followed . One of the epigrams of Francis E. Parker , the lawyer , is worth quoting . Of a friend whom he in reality loved , he remarked : " If he had lived in the Middle Ages , he would have gone to the stake for a principle under a misapprehension as to the facts . " Upon the occasion of a dinner for Porfirio Diaz , a Mexican Senator asked Lodge what he thought of the guest of honor . Lodge answered that he looked rather stern , as if he would not hesitate to shoot an enemy before breakfast . " Shoot an enemy ! " exclaimed the Mexican . " I have known him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a certain timeliness in one of the anecdotes about Evarts . On going to the polling-place in New York one election-clay , he was told by the election clerk that Mr. Evarts had already voted . " Has he , indeed ? " said the lawyer , pleasantly , as if there were no such thing as fraud in an election. - " I hope he voted right . " Sumner was not a wit , but there was keenness in a remark he made to Gambetta , after the two men had been discussing the situation in France . " Ah , M. Sumner , " said the French leader , " il nous faut un Jefferson ! " Sumner replied : " Trouvez un Washington , M. Gambetta , et un Jefferson . arrivera . " And , finally , there is the happy description made by Lowell , upon a Commencement Day , of one of the early benefactors of Harvard : " There is William Pennoyer , of whom we know nothing except that he comes down to us in the most graceful of attitudes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater interest in a life story than the turning-points . As it happens , Senator Lodge can put his finger upon the influences that determined him to become a public man and writer . He grew up without much thought of what he should be and do . It was not necessary that he should earn his bread ; and no particular spirit of ambition had been aroused in him when , a few weeks after his graduation from Harvard , he set out for Europe with his bride . That winter , in Rome , he found a classmate , named Simpson . This man also was wealthy , but was possessed of a longing to give his life to literature and public service . Association with him fired Lodge with the same determination . A few weeks after they had parted , Lodge heard of his death , whereupon he wrote of his new idea to Henry Adams , whose course in medi2eval history in Lodge 's senior year had been his first stimulus " to anything resembling active thought . " Adams replied encouragingly , and a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review , made Lodge his assistant . While engaged in this work , Lodge went through the Harvard Law School . He was then appointed a lecturer at Harvard in American history , which position he held for three years , resigning it in 1879 . The next year he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives , and began his political career . Familiar Spanish Travels . By W. D. Howells . New York : Harper &; Bros. $2 net . Those who have read " My Literary Passions " will recall Mr. Howells 's youthful enthusiasm for " Don Quixote , " " Lazarillo de Tormes , " and other masterpieces of Spanish fiction . In later years he found kindred spirits in writers like Palacio Valdes and Perez Galdes , whose realism , like his own , is relieved by abundant humor and an optimistic outlook upon life . It is surprising , therefore , that Mr. Howells waited until his seventy-fourth year before visiting a land in which he had long dwelt in imagination , and which meant so much to his friends , Longfellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rejoice that in his case Spain did not prove to be the unattainable Carcassonne . His tour was the conventional one embracing Burgos , Valladolid , Madrid , the Escorial , Toledo , Cordova , Seville , Granada ; Ronda , and Algeciras . He never strayed from the beaten track . All told he lingered only six weeks in Spain . We have , therefore , that comparative novelty : a book . of Spanish travels , the author of which does not pose as an authority or a romantic adventurer . And yet Mr. Howells had his adventures , of the same comfortable sort so often experienced by his own fictitious personages Not even one who travels first-class by the Sud-Express and frequents , when possible , the double-starred hotels , can quite escape them in a land where , like the Knight of the Rueful Countenance , " we may plunge our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures . " And when in Spain adventures fail , there are always misadventures for the traveller to fall back upon . Happily , Mr. Howells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception in Burgos , where he sat shivering beside a steamless radiator , and his failure to draw upon his letter of credit after a wait of several hours in a Valladolid bank . We can not help thinking that if lie had put up at a humbler hotel he might have basked before a comforting brazier . One always pays dearly for luxury in Spain . And was he , we may ask , playing the part of a Roman in Rome when he expected a Spanish banker to honor a letter of credit on the very day when it was presented ? Mr. Howells 's experiences make excellent copy . He is plainly most interested in human types and the trivial incidents of travel . The reader must not expect him to go into ecstasies over the Alhambra . He wisely refrains from attempting to out-Irving Irving . Instead , he disarms criticism by confining his narrative to his own personal experiences . Mr. Howells 's powers of close observation have not diminished with years . Every travelling-companion , cabman , servant , and blind beggar whom he met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these types his genial humor and kindly philosophy find free play . On the whole , Spain has left upon him a pleasant impression . He experienced no more disillusion than was to have been expected . The title is well chosen . Writer and reader meet on familiar terms , and on ending the book one feels that one has himself made a pleasant tour in delightful company . Drawings by Norman Irving Black and Walter Hale add attractiveness . Great Debates in American History . From the Debates in the British Parliament on the Colonial Stamp Act ( 1764-1765 ) to the Debates in Congress at the Close of the Taft Administration ( 1912-1913 ) . Edited by Marion Mills Miller . 14 vols . New York : The Current Literature Publish . ing ' Co . This collection is a very different sort of thing from a set of " The World 's Best Orations . " In those , the speeches are isolated , and are read as much for their literary as their political values . The present undertaking is rather to be compared with Benton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1856 . " The speeches are grouped by subject ; sometimes they are quoted in full , sometimes in part , sometimes merely summarized , and the historical circumstances of their delivery are given , together with some account of the development of the legislation which they influenced . The word " debates " is interpreted in these volumes in a broad sense , as they include a digest of the Federalist , the Dred Scott decision , partly verbatim , partly in summary , and Lincoln 's Gettysburg address . Each volume has an introduction in the form of a paper on some matter or public interest , although not all or these were written for this series . From an address of Senator Lodge , for instance , is drawn " The Constitution and Its Makers " ; from one by Charles Francis Adams , " The Doctrine of Equality and the Race Problem " ; and from one by President Van Elise , " Control of Trusts by Commission . " Among the others who contribute introductions are Woodrow Wilson , Walter H. Page , Henry Watterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burton . Each volume is illustrated with a photogravure of a public man or public event , such as Patrick Henry delivering the " liberty or death " speech , or Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation , and also with re productions of cartoons . In the preface is a selected bibliography of collections of American speeches . There are two indexes , one of persons and one of subjects . A work of this kind , done at all well , can not but be exceedingly useful . As evidence of his industry , the editor lets us know that he leafed every page in the records of Congressional debate , and that these contain two billion words . Better proof , not only of his industry , but of his judgment , is to be found in the text of the volumes resulting from this truly terrifying survey of verbosity . To take an example , the Webster-Hayne debate is introduced with a summary of its parliamentary history , while for a further discussion of the subject of public lands , out of which the debate arose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subsequent volume . After a brief description , in the language of contemporaries , of the scene when Webster arose to make his reply , we have the preliminary debate on " Consolidation , " the debate proper on " Disunion by Nullification , " with a cross-reference to a digest of Madison 's " Report on the Virginia Resolutions , " cited by Hayne , the latter 's almost forgotten rebuttal speech to Webster 's great effort , and , finally , Benton 's caustic commentary of a few days later upon the position of the Massachusetts Senator . The subjects treated range from the Stamp Act and the supremacy of Parliament as discussed in both England and America through State rights and the tariff , including Canbdian reciprocity , to child labor , pure food , woman suffrage , and the regulation of railway rates . All of these are arranged for the investigator with conscientious intelligence . The volumes put at the disposal of the student a mass of material , much of which has hitherto been buried so deep as to repel every one but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
