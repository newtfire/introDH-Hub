A decade of civil war has left the Salvadoran economy largely in a shambles . Some fields , planted with mines , lie fallow . Many factories are shuttered . But for those who make their living from the country ' s not-so-clandestine black market in dollars , these are boom times. // " When I first started here 10 years ago , there were six of us , " Edelmira Artiga de Romero , a money-changer , said as she sat in the shade in front of the post office , handing out currency from a $13 , 000 wad of dollars and Salvadoran colons to a subaltern serving a client in a nearby car . " Now there are 300 just around here . " <> <> Sending Money Home // What has put them in business are the dollars sent back here by the enormous number of Salvadorans who have gone to the United States since the start of the war . Studies conducted here and in the United States estimate that of the one million Salvadorans in the United States , more than 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also communities of Salvadorans in Canada , Australia and Western Europe. // Exactly how much money these Salvadorans abroad send to their 5. 25 million compatriots at home is difficult to determine . A 1987 study conducted by the University of Central America here put the figure at more than $1 billion a year , but United States Embassy officials say that amount would swamp the economy and estimate that the flow does not exceed $400 million annually . <> <> ' I Hope They Don ' t Come Back ' // Either figure , however , would be large enough to make remittances from abroad the largest single source of foreign exchange for the battered Salvadoran economy . Coffee , traditionally the country ' s largest export product , earned $369 million last year , while direct economic assistance from the United States came to $314 million. // " I hope they don ' t come back , at least not right now , " a leading businessman said , referring to his compatriots abroad . " These people are our No. 1 export source , and the economy needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Segundo Montes , a sociologist who directed the university study , said his data indicated that more than one-third of all Salvadoran families have relatives in the United States and that each Salvadoran wage-earner abroad sends an average of $115 home monthly. // " The most profitable investment you can have is a relative in the United States , " Dr. Montes said . " With a recession in everything else , that ' s what is sustaining the life of the people. " // Indeed , the black market for dollars has become so important that it now appears to be the principal source of foreign exchange for those who wish to do business overseas or to travel . " There is virtually no liquidity in the banking system itself , " a diplomat here said , estimating that net foreign reserves have fallen to as low as $25 million this year . <> <> ' Psychological War ' // In a recent speech on the economy , President Alfredo Cristiani said that when he took office on June 1 , he found that " 65 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parallel market , if you prefer. " // But Mr. Cristiani has also taken a series of steps aimed at restoring public confidence in the official banking system so that it can be more competitive with the black market . " There ' s a tremendous psychological war going on , " an " unofficial " money dealer said. // The new Government ' s first step was to abandon efforts to sustain the colon at a value of 5 to the dollar . That official exchange rate has given way to a " managed float " of the colon at about 6. 4 to the dollar , as compared to 6. 5 to the dollar on the black market , thereby closing the gap between the two markets from 30 percent to less than 1 percent. // Economists and diplomats here say the Government is considering other measures , like broadening eligibility to open dollar accounts in local banks , which might discourage Salvadorans from depositing the dollars they acquire here in accounts in the United States . A plan to legalize and regulate money exchange houses is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to sell dollars now get a better price with no questions asked , importers and prospective tourists complain it is still virtually impossible to buy dollars through the official system. // " Cristiani is trying to hoard dollars , " said a money-changer who does business from a boutique here . " The banks will buy them , but they don ' t like to sell them because the Government has a deficit it needs to make up . " <> <> Private Postal Services // With the rise in the importance of remittances has also come what Ricardo Siman , president of the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry , calls " a boom in courier services " that compete for the lucrative traffic in checks and other money instruments between El Salvador and the United States. // Salvadorans routinely complain that checks and money orders that are sent through official channels but never reach their destination nevertheless end up being negotiated on the black market , and blame postal workers for the problem. // Late last month , postal officials threatened to shut down the parallel mail services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport and delivery of correspondence is a function of the state . " Postmaster General Rafael Uribe accused the couriers of defrauding users with false advertising and high tariffs. // " The people have remained loyal to our service , " Mr. Uribe wrote to the newspaper recently . " Thousands of letters containing checks are delivered daily and immediately exchanged by the hundreds of money- changers who swarm the blocks near our offices , thereby offering themselves as faithful testimony that the postal service is achieving its objectives.
