THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE read with interest the other day that the State Department has announced the shipment of several million dollars ' worth of conventional weapons to the Near East in order to " contribute to the stability of the area . " The particular target of the government 's beneficence on this occasion is the Kingdom of Jordan , which our diplomats arc persuaded just now needs its defenses bolstered against brother Arab nations as well as against Israel . Since the United States has for a number of years been bestowing military favors on this or that country in the Levant , including Israel , it occurs to us that Washington , with an assist from Moscow , may conceivably be underwriting a policy of mutual deterrence for Jordan and the rest  --  a smalleconomy-size replica , that is , of the foreign policy that has proved so durable in sustaining America 's grand misalliance with the Soviet Union . Standing the Near East to a cold war of its own may he a mark of American affluence , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sooner or later , it seems to us , the presumed beneficiaries , as is so often the case with beneficiaries , may begin to wonder whether they are being shortchanged . It hardly retjuires special powers of insight to imagine that in due course the underdeveloped belligerents of the Near East will grow discontented at receiving the same old shipments , the same old proliferation of conventional junk that , given an outbreak of mutual non-deterrence , would take so absurdly long to lay Cairo or Tel Aviv or Amman low . How about a little round of the nuclear stuff , we can hear Jordan and the others demanding of Washington , or Moscow . Praise the Lord , whether Allah or Jehovah , and pass the ammunition  --  but nuclear . OME nights back , a man and wife O ' we know were sitting and reading in the living room of their apartment , in Greenwich Village , when first the man and then his wife detected an odd burning odor  --  gas nr burning rubber . The wife went into the kitchen to make certain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fireplace , where some of his more desperate attempts to create a blaze had from time to time produced odd smells . When both the stove and the fireplace had proved to he innocent , the couple began to suspect that the smell might be coming from an electrical short circuit . Believing this to he the type of suspicion that should be checked immediately , and feeling the need to have an official present , the man phoned the superintendent of the building , who had never displayed any talent for electronics or odor detection , or any good sportsmanship about being roused from his television set after dinner . The wife , meanwhile , turned off the lights , and then , feeling that nothing would be as embarrassing as having the super walk in and find no odor at all , turned them on again . While waiting for the super , the couple began some more systematic sniffing . " It 's not at the switch , " the wife said , moving a chair out of her path as she made her way along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , " the man said , front the other side of the room , " It seems to he farther along toward the corner , " the wife said . When she had finally satisfied herself that she had reached the source of the odor , a strange look came over her face . " It may be just a coincidence , " she said to her husband , " but I seem to be standing right next to the window . " Her husband forthrightly walked across the room and opened the window , and stuck his head into the night air The smell was the city . So far , this man has refused to divulge to anyone the details of his second conversation with the superintendent . It must have been embarrassing enough to make him angry , though , because he has since become interested , for the first time , in finding nut , once and for all , who is responsible for the air 's containing irrelevant items like short-circuit odors . ( A small box in the Times the following morning , headlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " said only that " the source apparently was in New Jersey . " ) We were able to be of some help . Until a few weeks before , when we read another Time 's item  --  also a box of only two or three inches , with the headline " THAT ODOR DOWNTOWN NO CAUSE . FOR ALARM " ? we , trio , had been puzzled about where all the air pollution could he coming from . After all , Consolidated Edison had stated that it was innocent ; the automobile manufacturers were taking no more blame for foul air than they used to take for automobile-accident deaths ; and when a spokesman for the New Jersey Petroleum Council was told that the use of sulphurous fuels was impairing the health of New York citizens , he said , " There is no generally accepted evidence that year-round use of extremely low-sulphur-content fuels is necessary to protect the health of the public , " which may have been a particularly guarded assertion of innocence but was an assertion of innocence nonetheless . The " THAT ODOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when hundreds of citizens phoned various agencies the previous day to report " an odor usually associated with the presence of natural gas , " the Department of Air Pollution Control had assured them that the odor was not natural gas but , perhaps , mercaptan , " a chemical put into natural gas in very small quantities to give it a warning odor . " ( That seemed to us a surprisingly Zen approach for the Department of Air Pollution Control to be taking . When is a warning odor only an odor , and not a warning ? ) The Department said the mercaptan could have come from a laboratory or " from a youngster 's chemistry set , " That is the kind of straight talk we have been waiting to hear from the air-pollution-control effort . Politics and influence be damned , let the chips fall where they may . If the chemistry sets are causing the trouble , let 's get right after the chemistry sets , Maybe everybody should leave Con Edison alone and start investigating F. A. O. Schwarz . Aglow DIANA Daw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash on and off . Her studio is on the eighth floor of an old loft building in the garment district , and we flashed down there the other noon to see what was up . Somewhat to our disappointment , Miss Dew greeted us in a non-electronic outfit  --  black tights , a black-and-white mini-smock , and gold-rimmed eyeglasses with special Mercurochrome-tinted lenses that Bausch &; Lomb had turned out to her specifications . Her hair , which is dark blond , was snipped in a tight Sassoonish cut of her own design . Her studio was a mess  --  tabletops , desks , chairs , and couches buried under piles of brightly colored cloth , unkempt coils of insulated wire , miniature electrical components , soldering irons and other tools , an odd boot or spur or two , and lots of dust . " The painter 's coming today , " Miss Dew explained . " We 're going to do everything in five or six Day-Glo colors . We 've been here only two months , and we have n't had a chance until now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " We nodded . Miss Dew held up a dark-blue vinyl dress with a hip-hugging vinyl belt and eight lamps  --  one-anda-half-inch vertical stripes of electroluminescent plastic  --  sewn into the fabric , at intervals of something under five inches . " It looks much groovier in the dark , " she said , snapping off an overhead light . She closed two doors to make a darkroom out of a tiny entrance hall , put the dress on the floor , and switched on a power pack that hung from the belt like a transistor radio . The lamps began to glow  --  an eerie underwater green . She turned a control knob  --  a potentiometer , she told us  --  and the glow began to skitter across the dress , jumping from one stripe to the next . " The power comes from rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries , like the ones used in electric toothbrushes , " she said . " The charge lasts five hours ; you plug the dress into a wall socket overnight . The speed of the flash can be adjusted by a twist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing and the miisic comes on faster  --  ham-hambam-da-da . " Miss Dew twirled the control knob , and the lights blinked in a faster rhythm . " Of course , this is only a prototype ! ' The actual dresses , which are scheduled to go on sale at the Paraphernalia shops in February , for a hundred and fifty dollars and up , will have miniature components capable of performing even more sophisticated tricks . On one dress , twenty-four colored squares will flash on and off in a virtually random pattern , with as many as twelve flashes per second . Other items will he a conventional white coat dress bearing a discreetly flashing red heart , and a short shift with two tiny lights on the midriff flashing " Stop " and " Go " in the appropriate colors . According to Miss Dew , the electronic clothes will he absolutely safe ; the lamps give off no perceptible heat , and all the gadgetry snaps out , so that the dresses can he cleaned . The young designer switched on the overhead light . We followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick lunch of wheat germ and apricot yoghurt , we asked her to tell us how she happened to design the world 's first electronic dress . The answer turned out to be nothing less than the story of her life . She was horn in Memphis , Tennessee , on June 25 , 1943 . She worked as a fashion model for ten years ( between the ages of four and fourteen ) , attended a very proper private school for girls , which , of course , she hated , and studied at the Memphis Academy of Art . Then her parents separated , and she went to live with her father in West Palm Beach , where she " got into cars , " as she put it . She learned to take sports cars apart and put them together again ; she drove in rallies and gymkhanas ( lying about her age when necessary ) , and " made the Sebring and Daytona scene . " At the same time , she was appearing in high-school dramatic productions , and she won a medal for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had to dry the seaweed and classify it according to its potential nutritive value , grind each variety by hand , and then mix it and bake it into cakes , breads , and cookies . " Even in those days , I was fooling with a combination of technology and art , but it took me a long time to recognize the fact , " she told us . " I just wish I 'd started sooner . " After high school , she put in a year at Bard College , a few months in New York as a student of Method acting , and a summer working as an apprentice mechanic in a sports-car repair shop in Palm Beach . Then she enrolled at the University of Florida as an engineering major . But a spring-vacation job with the Lockheed Missiles &; Space Co. in California convinced her that she could never be happy as what she termed " a cog in a big machine . " Miss Dew continued , " When I got hack to the University of Florida , I started turning on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LSD , peyote , all the hallucinogens  --  with the hipper students and professors . Turning on got me hack in the whole creative bag . " At the end of the 196263 college year , she bought a used Alfa Romeo and headed for California again . " But the flywheel ring gear was completely stripped , and the car would n't start without a. push , and the clutch needed a new pressure plate . " So she stopped off in Memphis for a complete overhaul , and talked herself into a job as costume designer for the Front Street Theatre , which was , she said , " the only possibly hip place in town . " She added , " I knew I could do the work , because I 'd been making my own clothes ever since I was tiny . " When the 1964 season ended , in June , she swapped her rebuilt Alfa for a Volkswagen bus , converted this into a camper , and set out for the West Coast . " It was real groovy . I took my time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone  --  I was still trying to figure out who I was . " She enrolled THE NEW YORKER 27 " Now that they 've cracked the genetic code , I suppose everyone will want to be Peabodys. " at the Berkeley Campus of the University of California , where she encountered " a whole freaky scene in San Francisco , like the lower East Side here , " she said . " Everything 's insane . Everyone 's freaking out  --  long acid trips , orgies , saturation , saturation , expanding , expanding . Finally , I decided that that 's not where it 's ' at . ' Quote , unquote . The whole idea is to shock the nervous system out of its normal pattern , but as soon as you become used to it , LSD becomes your normal pattern , and then you 're still searching for something new . " So she reactivated her Volkswagen camper and toured the Southwestern United States . After a brief stopover in Florida , she drove north to New York , where she " made the East Side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her case , brown rice and green tea . " It was wonderful . I felt stoned naturally ! " Then she designed some special clothes for Joan Baez and decided that there might he a steady market for her wilder fashion ideas . " But I could n't go around knocking on doors to get a job , " she said . " My ego is n't built that way . " Instead , she went to Cambridge , Massachusetts , where she sold her bus and used the money to convert an apartment near Harvard Square into a custom-dress shop called Isis . She sewed her own creations at the rate of two a day , and built a local reputation . " But the people who really dug my stuff could n't afford to buy it . I was so hung up for bread I thought of modelling again . " When she went to a modelling agency , the woman in charge told her to stick to designing , and arranged an interview fur her with an executive of the Puritan Fashions Corporation , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Dew was in New York designing Mod outfits for Puritan 's Paraphernalia division , and four months after that she was given a new division of her own  --  Experipuritaneous ( for " Experimental Puritan Outrageousness " ) . Her basic idea was to create by natural means the hallucinatory color switches , afterimages , and strobe effects produced by psychedelic drugs . " I 'd been wanting to design an electronic dress for years , but I could n't solve the technical problems  --  until now , " she said . Miss Dew does not intend to let her success go to her head , although she claims that she is " stoned " on her work . Despite the pressures of New York , she is devoting all her evening hours to a new artistic project  --  an all-g'rl rock-'n ' - roll group that she and her associate , Babette Low , who is twenty-two , have organized .

In the middle , and above them , standing on the podium  --  red-carpeted , behind a golden rail  --  the conductor made a dark , waving , dipping silhouette against the white rear wall of the stage . " The young people can pick the piece they 're most friendly with to start , " whispered a short , red-haired lady who was sitting behind us , in the twelfth row . She was Miss Hanna Saxon , representing the Women 's Division of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies , which sponsored the competition .

" Critique AMONG the millions , perhaps billions , of words expended on the Super Bowl game the Monday after that apocalyptic event was this conversation , overheard by a friend of ours in a crowded delicatessen : FIRST DINER ( quickly finishing a rhic ken-liver-on-rye ) : Anyway , the Chiefs should 've gone with a zone defense . What business they got letting their cornerbacks play it man for man against the Packers ? SECOND DINER : You ca n't defend against a quick release like Bart Starr has .

You want something for dessert ? FIRST DINER : What are you a wise guy ? Conductors AYOUNG man standing on the podium at Carnegie Hall jabbed tilt : air with his baton as the orchestra finished playing a couple of bars the way he had just sung them . " Good ! " he cried , and then the orchestra resumed where it had left off  --  near the beginning of Tchaikovsky 's Symphony No. 4 in F Minor . It was nine-fortyfive in the morning . By about nine-fifty , the young conductor 's neatly brushed hair had begun to dishevel , and with each sweeping gesture of his arms a hit more of the black turtleneck sweater he was wearing emerged from the back of his trousers . Seven judges sat scattered through the handsome , empty hall , listening , making notes , sometimes fidgeting , and even  --  occasionally  --  yawning . They were watching the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conductors , in which forty-two candidates from seventeen countries would eventually compete . The members of the orchestra  --  the Orchestra of America  --  were dressed informally , and made a patchwork of color across the stage ; here a green dress , there a yellow sweater and a pink merit as assistant conductor of either the New York Philharmonic or the National Symphony Orchestra , in Washington , D.C. , for the 1967-68 season , she told us , and there were many lesser awards . " How do the judges judge ? " we whispered . Miss Saxon assured us they would have no trouble . " In my work , I can tell in thirty seconds if a person is a good organizer , " she said . The judges halted the Tchaikovsky , and the young conductor swung the orchestra into a Hindemith symphony . " Each candidate gets eighteen minutes , " Miss Saxon said . Presently , the conductor 's time ran out , and he left the stage , to the accompaniment of a rustle of appreciative how tappings . The next candidate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , again , a black turtleneck sweater  --  walked onstage , shook hands with the concertmaster , chatted briefly with the first violins , and then crouched on the apron of the stage talking with several of the judges , who were standing below . There was a sudden air of consternation , so Miss Saxon hurried down the aisle to see what was wrong , and a moment later she returned , saying , " Somebody brought the wrong symphony . " She glanced at the stage , where the candidate was walking away . " Let me go back and calm him , " she said , and dashed down the aisle again . An intermission was called , and the musicians stood up . In the hallway outside , a few minutes later , several members of the orchestra were standing by a water fountain near a picture of Berlioz and regaling each other with stories of other conductors , other days . " It was 1921 , I think , " a short elderly man with a violinist 's black cloth attached to his left shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , interrupting , and adding comments . " He would n't even give you time to pick up your fiddle ! " the violinist went on . He imitated the conductor under discussion , raising his arms suddenly and giving an almost instantaneous downbeat . " Boom ! " he exclaimed , and the others exploded with laughter . A silent man with a gleaming trombone hanging over his arm like an umbrella walked around the jolly group to the water fountain and filled a paper cup with water . He stepped back , and carefully poured the entire cup into the mouthpiece of his trombone . Then he solemnly worked the slide up and down , producing rich sloshing noises of various tones . He removed the slide , returned to the Fountain , and poured the water out of the slide into the fountain , Then he reassembled his trombone and walked silently away . The group by the Berlioz picture were now into another anecdote . " He used to point at you and yell ' You ! What 's your name ? ' " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was getting madder and madder , and poor Elsner was so scared he was hunt down , hiding behind his music stand , shaking . You ! What 's your- name ? ' Well , Elsner was too terrified to answer , and final 's he yells at Elsner , ' You Elmer ! What 's your 92 ( 2271f " The musicians roared with delight . Inside , a violinist and a lady viola player were sitting together halfway back in the hall and talking about how quickly they could judge a new conductor . " You can tell immediately , " said the girl , who was wearing a green dress and holding her viola and bow . " Their presence  --  even their greeting . They have to be able to convince the orchestra they know what they 're doing . They must have a clear heat , too . " The violinist said , " A bad conductor either does n't feel the music or ca n't communicate . The job is to communicate . Sometimes a conductor has n't developed the social aspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad . " The girl nodded . " He 's like a painter then . He makes it all a unit . We 're at his mercy . " The break ended , and a few minutes later the next candidate appeared . He was a thin , casual young man , dressed in a blue turtleneck sweater ; the heavyset candidate who had been given the wrong symphony was apparently being allowed time to recover hackstage . The thin young man conducted part of a Mozart symphony , and when he stopped to correct the orchestra it was with a smiling , do-you-mind-awfully British manner . " The accompaniment must be very quiet , so the people with the tune can play very delicately , " he explained during his third selection . " Just once more , please . " When he departed , there was a gentle rapping of bows . Then the heavyset young man came out again and ascended the podium . He began with a Haydn symphony , and he conducted with a crisp , confident style . There seemed little doubt of his authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments to get his at-tendon , since the Haydn was rollicking along at a good , loud clip  --  and gave him a selection by de Falla .
