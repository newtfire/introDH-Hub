No major U.S. railroad has wheezed through more investigations-or heard more advice-than the bankrupt New York , New Haven &; Hartford . Creditors have poked , probed and counseled ; so have state commissions and committees of weary commuters , whose fares have gone up 108% since 1955 . It was probably inevitable that the Kennedy Administration would step in : after all , the Government has guaranteed $35 million in loans to the New Haven . <P> To help the most troubled railroad in the East , the Commerce Department last week tapped one of the best railroaders in the West . It selected Frederic B. Whitman , 63 , president of the Western Pacific Railroad , to head a panel of nine top railroad men who will make a roundhouse-to-trestle study of the New Haven , propose how to get it back on the tracks . <P> Whitman is an experienced railroad doctor . He went into railroading straight out of Harvard ( ' 19 ) , rose to become chief of the Western Pacific in 1949 , when it was only five years out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from governmental commissions to slash money-losing passenger services , bought new equipment and attracted high-rate freight . Within a year , the Western Pacific was solidly in the black , and it has been profitable since then . Just last month Whitman reported that W.P. profits in 1961 rose 24% , to $5,000,000.
