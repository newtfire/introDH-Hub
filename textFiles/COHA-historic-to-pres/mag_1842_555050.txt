THE usual phrases of commendation , when readers feel themselves " carried along with the writer , " and when the scenes have been " made real and personal to themselves , " show that it is an excellent thing in narrative for the reader to be identified as much as possible with the writer . In no way , we believe , can this be more completely done , than when the adventurer tells his own story . The great master upon the strings of the heart well understood this , and , from his Desdemona down , we are taught , that , if one wishes to interest others in himself or his fortunes , he should tell his own story and that will woo them . In novels , romances , and other works of fiction intended to be received as such , approaching as they do the drama , it is better , indeed , that the writer should he hidden and not speak as in his own person . There the reader is to be interested in several // persons alike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in all of which the hero can not participate . But in narratives of fact of a personal nature , and in fictions of the same kind intended to be received as fact , the use of the first person in the narrator has been found most successful . Of the latter class , Swift 's " Gulliver , " and Defoe 's " Robinson Crusoe " and " History of the Plague in London , " may he the best examples ; while of the former the pleasant recollections of every reader can supply him with many instances , to which we trust he will add , if he has not done so already , the book now before us . Evidence of the superiority of the first person in narrative may also be obtained from the coldness and formality , the want of particularity where it would assist , and the abundance of detail where it is in the way , found in the attempts of many writers , in other respects skilful , at describing scenes and events none of which they saw , and no part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every reader will allow , owes a great part of its interest to the prevalence of the diary form , by means of continuous extracts from the journals of both the writer and his subject and perhaps the want of this form may partly account for the little interest taken in the biographies of men as distinguished as Johnson , written by historians far more clever than Boswell . Even in Southey 's " Life of Nelson , " perfect specimen of the narrative style as it is , who would not give up a good deal of the literary excellence of the Laureate , for a little more of the personal narrative by the hero himself ? And the despatches , letters , and fragmentary journals of Wellington show us the man , and in many respects the times , the men of the times , and the true character of the events , far better than the labored histories and commentaries of the most exact compilers would do . When we are reading the personal narrative of the man himself , written ,  --  not as an historian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - hut fresh and fairly at the time of their happening , our human sympathies are more called forth ; we feel " drawn by the cords of a man " ; there is *o master of ceremonies or interpreter between us and our friend ; but we see him face to face . Let the narrator of his own experience set down , honestly and simply , the very things that most impressed him at the // time , whether they afterwards seem to him great or little , and in the same manner in which they then impressed him , using his common sense and whatever he may have of poetic instinct in the selection , without any reference to what is called the " dignity of history , " or to what may have been said by the Greeks and Romans , by Blair or Alison . Then , if his experience is at all worth the attention of his readers , he will hardly fail of success , and of the best kind of success , the personal sympathy and good-will of those who are thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing of the poetic nature , or a feeling heart , all the things he has seen and heard that appeal to either of these qualities , will inevitably have impressed him at the time he met with them , and he will give them out again somewhat as they were felt by him , and thus they will find an answering chord in every imaginative or feeling reader . We douht if the poetic in personal narratives of fact should he carried further than this ; and , whenever more has been attempted , there has usually been a failure . The poetical effect should come rather from the thing presented , than from the eloquence of the writer . He may not comment much upon the fact , nor apply many epithets ; yet such a book speaks , although it is " rather the voice of nature speaking through it , than any distinct voice of its own . " Let the reader make his own exclamations , - would be a good caution to not a few descriptive writers . The narrator is the guide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fairest scenes , conducts us to the best points of sight , directs our particular attention sparingly here and there , throws in at times an interesting legend or fact , which fastens to each place some human sympathy , and leaves nature otherwise to her own work , which when genuine is always somewhat silent . If we find him turning aside to practise stage tricks , and to recite the scraps of descriptive poetry he has learned , we not only feel his presence annoying , but lose our confidence in his capacity and fidelity as a guide . Let it not be thought that there is little credit due to the writer in such cases . There is much every way . For it is owing , in the first instance , to his capacity for feeling what is sublime or beautiful , picturesque or touching , that the things he presents become so to his reader . For a man of an ordinary mind , with the best education and intentions , // might have travelled the same round , and neither seen the same things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault here , and seem surprised that , without the usual vocabulary and ornaments of picturesque connoisseurship , but with all plainness of speech , the events and scenes should be so very poetic and interesting . As our great orator says of eloquence , " It is in the men , and in the occasion . It can not be taught in the schools . It can not be brought from far . Labor and learning may toil after it , but they can not reach it . Words and sentences may be marshalled in every way , but they can not compass it . " Lamartine set out from France upon a poetic tour to the East , intending to write an account of the countries he visited , in which all their capabilities of supplying materials for picturesque , descriptive , or romantic interest , whether in scenery , dress , customs , historical incident , tradition , or song , were to be exhausted ; yet we doubt whether there is a Saxon mind , or a reader of the older classics , to whom the tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition , for the benefit of the playwrights and scene-painters of the modern classic , legitimate drama , or the getters-up of annuals , albums , and " elegant extracts . " Our countryman , Stephens , went over much of the same ground ; and in his work the landscapes and interesting spots of those countries , - the manners , dress , tones of voice , attitudes , forms and faces of the people , - their ancient ruins , their superstitious worship , stand out before us distinct and quick with life ; while the reader of the French narrative leaves it with a vague and rather painful impression of having been led through much picturesque description , and many details of what he is willing to believe were beautiful scenes , but with few distinct , characterizing impressions . Stephens knew , that , without an eye for nature and the various exhibitions of men , he could not make his book poetical by drawing upon his scholarship for figures , images , epithets , and similes ; and that , with those qualities , human , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vividly upon his readers ; a truth which , some would say , the brilliant Frenchman never knew . Many of our descriptive writers remind us of what Julius Hare says of a certain school of English poets , now passed away . " Every thing they had to mention was described // and reflected upon . First one thing was described and reflected upon ; then another thing was described and reflected , and then something else was treated in the same manner . The power of infusing life and exhibiting nature is xvanting . No word was supposed to be capable of standing alone ; all must have a crutch to lean upon ; every object must be attended by an epithet or two , or by a phrase , picked out , much as a school-boy picks his out of a Gradus , from some repository of such phraseology . " Who can tell in what consists the character and charm of a description ? The note of a solitary bird , the resting or flitting of a shadow , a single instinctive life-giving epithet , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master and finishing touch , which gives the hue to the entire picture ; the keystone by which the whole becomes fitly framed together . The most discursive and philosophic thought , and the most gorgeous ima* , ination , may not be best fitted for narrative , and for description of things of sense and actual human life , whether in prose or verse . In short , we believe that the style and cast of mind of Homer and Chaucer are better in that respect , than those of Milton and Wordsworth . The lovers of the direct , manly , and simple narrative of personal adventures will be glad to see an addition made to the number of such works , in the " Voyages and Commercial Enterprises " of Mr. Cleveland . As the object of a review is not only to comment upon a book which the reader is supposed to be acquainted with , but also to afford information to , and endeavour to interest in the book , those who have not seen it , we will give a short outline of the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some remarks upon them as they occur . The Preface is exceedingly prepossessing . The author 's reasons for hoping his narrative may interest the reader are thus modestly given . " More than forty.five years have elapsed since the first of the voyages here narrated was undertaken ; and more than twenty since the completion of the last . It is apparent that they possess but in a small degree the power to interest , that would have been excited , had they been published at the period of their performance ; yet this delay in their publication may , on some considerations , enhance their value . It may be interesting to the young merchant to trace some of the great revolutions in // the commerce of the world , which have occurred within the above-named periods ; and those of advanced age may he induced to recur to hy-gone days , with pleasing , even if accompanied with melancholy associations . " - pp. iii. , iv . After detailing some striking instances of the changes the course of commerce has undergone within the last forty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor me with a perusal of my narrative will perceive , that I have navigated to all parts of the world , from the sixtieth degree of south latitude , to the sixtieth degree of north ; and sometimes in vessels whose diminutive size and small number of men caused exposure to wet and cold , greatly surpassing what is usually experienced in ships of ordinary capacity ; that I have been exposed to the influence of the most unhealthy places ; at Batavia , where I have seen whole crews prostrate with the fever , and death making havoc among them ; at San Blas , where the natives can stay only a portion of the year ; at the Havana , within whose walls I have resided five years consecutively ; that I have suffered captivity , robhery , imprisonment , ruin , and the racking anxiety consequent thereon . And yet , through the whole , and to the present sixty-eighth year of my age , I have never taken a drop of spirituous liquor of any kind ; never a glass of wine , of porter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and coffee ; and , moreover , I have never used tobacco in any way whatever ; and this , not only without injury , hut , on the contrary , to the preservation of my health . Headache is known to me by name only ; and excepting those fevers , which were produced by great anxiety and excitement , my life has been free from sickness . " - p. viii . The author is a gentleman of great respectability , who early in life , at a period in our national history when commnercial enterprise called off the flower of our young men , entered into the merchant service and engaged in long and arduous voyages . He bad received a mercantile education , and at the age of eighteen made his first voyage in his new calling . At one and twenty , he was in the command of a vessel . There is a fact which may be observed upon here , and which we have seen no attempt made to account for or illustrate . The mercantile marine of the United States is upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most other European countries . The enormous navy of England , embracing as it does the revenue service and the greater // part of the marine mail-carriage , together with her large chartered companies , whose service is quasi military , take up the young men of the more genteel classes , so that there is little motive for them to engage in the general merchant service ; and the long term of apprenticeship there would go far to prevent them , were they inclined to enter it . In the United States , on the contrary , the navy is small in proportion to the maritime interests and habits of the people ; the army calls off hut few ; there are no large institutions like the East India Company ; while the merchant service has no apprentice system or restriction upon promotions , includes the whole India trade , and , indeed , every variety of unrestricted adventure , and offers speedy promotion and profitahle employment to young men of influential connexions . Accordingly , it is not uncommon , especially in the New England States , for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving a college education , to enter the mercantile marine ; where , after a couple of years or so on ship-hoard , sometimes before the mast , hut oftener in the steerage , passed usually in India or Pacific voyages , and after a voyage in each of the lower grades of office , they assume the command of a ship , which their friends may he ahle to procure for them ; and , as they often unite the duties of supercargo , or factor , or part owner , to that of master , sometimes acquire handsome fortunes . With us , too , mercantile pursuits are not , as in England , looked down upon as plebeian , so that interest in commerce , and acquaintance with it , are much more general among all classes . Our merchant vessels , too , perhaps in part from the same cause , are much more elegant than the English , and are the pride and ornament of our seaports . It is true , there is a prejudice with many against the class of commanders of whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly to the fact , that some of them have stepped into command without a proper service before the mast , after a voyage or two as passengers and lookers-on , - literally coming in at the cabin windows . It is a common saying , and a true one , that it requires three years to make a sailor . The duties of a common seaman , especially the manual skill requisite in working upon rigging , with its varieties of knotting , splicing , seizing , turning-in , and setting-up , demand time and long practice in the acquisition , as do // the crafts of the carpenter , and shoemaker ; yet , at the risk of displeasing some of the marlinspike captains , we would say , that , although no knowledge in his profession is amiss , this manual skill at the marlinspike , the tiller , and on the yard , gained only by so many years of practice , requiring too , it is said , that the boy should be on the ratlins at fourteen , thus cutting him off from school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are not essential to the master of a vessel . The duties of the master are very different from those of the common seaman . The latter is literally a mere hand on hoard the vessel , and need know nothing of navigation , and little of the science of working the ship . Indeed , his duties are so purely mechanical , that we would put it to any one acquainted with the service , whether an old sea-dog , who has always heen before the mast , is not very nearly disqualified from being an energetic , punctual , and conciliating superintendent and commander . The most essential duty of the master is the navigation , or , as that term is understood on ship-hoard , the keeping of the position and directing the course of the vessel by mathematical and astronomical observations . This is a matter of science , and one in which long practice with instruments , and much examination and comparison of results , are requisite . Upon this knowledge the safety of the vessel depends , and neither skill in other duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next to the navigating comes the science of working or manoeuvring the vessel . In this we do not hesitate to say , that an intelligent , firm young man , who , at the age of eighteen or twenty , after some years spent in receiving an education on shore , enters for the first time the nautical service , makes a long voyage before the mast , keeps his watch , and carries on duty a year or so in each of the inferior grades of office , by the help of his books and a close practical observation and diligent attention while master , and the acquired habit of commanding others and relying upon himself , will work a ship better at thirt ) r , than one at the same age would do , who was set adrift at twelve , and has stayed in the forecastle splicing ropes and hauling out earrings until he was six and twenty . Where can ships be worked better than by the first lieutenants of men-of-war , English or American ? Yet these officers can rarely hold a marlinspike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to have skill in those things . They know how the work should he done , have an eye to what is shipshape , and can superintend those who do the manual labor . There are other reasons why good early education , and the habits of good society , are advantageous to the master . The faculty of commanding others with dignity and kindness , and of insuring willing obedience , is almost as important in an officer as any scientific attainment ; and , although it is a common saying , that a man should be a sailor first , that he may know how to treat a sailor , yet we believe , that experience will hardly support the maxim . On the contrary , where a man is elevated to a despotic command over men with whom , in point of education , manners , language , and associations , he is nearly on a par , and over whom he has no superiority but that of office , many evils may follow . His authority must he preserved , a certain kind of dignity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference xviii he apt to come unnaturally and by force . Seamen instinctively show it to any person whose general appearance , manners , bearing ) and conversation mark him to be of an education and class in society superior to their own , and an amusing contrast is often observable between the respect which they unconsciously and without forethought show to a passenger of this description , and that which is jealously extorted from them by an uneducated and low-bred master . The dignities and ceremonies of command sit ungracefully upon such an officer ; and , indeed , authority , especially if accompanied with some degi'ee of etiquette , is rarely committed to men brought up in the exercise of the humblest offices without producing the worst effects upon both the governor and the governed ; so much so , that we believe the almost unanimous voice of iien over whom such authority is to be exercised would he in favor of having it in the hands of persons educated to stations of dignity , and not committed to one of their own number . The author of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mast without rising to command , says his experience has always been , that seamen receive better treatnnent , and that obedience and deference are more naturally and willingly shown , where the power was exercised by men accustomed from boyhood to dealing with persons inferior to themselves in those ranks , which the course of society always evolves out of the // necessities and accidents of life . Mr. Cleveland bears testimony to the same effect in several instances ; as in his description of the contrast seen in the manners and conduct of two British naval commanders , Guise and Foster , on the Chilian station , the former of whom , he says , " had been reared and educated in polished society , and the other among the low and vulgar ; " And again , in his account , which we shall extract more fully hereafter , of his passage down the coast of Peru in the British frigate . flndromache , Captain Sheriffe . Chamier , in his " Life of a Sailor , " expresses his preference for those midshipmen , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seventeen , acquiring the education , manners , and feelings of gentlemen , over those who had been turned into the cockpit or steerage at twelve . He speaks of them as not only more creditable to their country for their scientific acquirements , and in their intercourse with foreigners , but as generally more to be depended upon in the discharge of duty , more readily stimulated or controlled by appeals to their self-respect , and more easily securing the obedience and respect of the crew . And it is heyond dispute , that , in the army of the United States , we may attribute to the effects of the collegiate education of the officers at West Point , not only a better state of feeling among the officers themselves , and a higher standard of deportment toward one another , but also the fact , that the severe martial discipline of the service is now enforced in a manner remarkably mild and dignified , without the violence and coarseness formerly so common , and with that gentlemanly and courteous demeanor , and that spirit of self-respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is almost always willingly and deferentially rendered . Now we see no reason why the same results should not follow in the merchant service . Indeed , an earnest of them is already to be found in the comparison of this service in England with our own . A recent English writer , speaking upon that subject , says , that there is with the republicans more etiquette , and a nicer observance of the distinctions of rank , than in the British service . The American masters and officers are more particular in their dress and deportment , and associate less with the seamen . If a difficulty arises and a man is to be punished , the forms of law are more carefully observed ; the seaman is put in irons or otherwise confined , and , // if corporal chastisement is thought necessary , all hands are called aft , the offence is explained , and he is flogged publicly , and with somewhat of the forms and ceremonies of a judicial proceeding . With the English , on the contrary , the supremacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collision , hy what they call fair play , that is , by clenched fists , ropes ' ends , bandspikes , and heavers . A word and a blow enforce the law , and a challenge to personal combat is the last resort . There may be as much tyranny and disregard of law in the American service as in the English ; but it takes a different form , and one far less likely to lower the dignity and proper authority of office , and to end in riot and danger to life and property . It is often asked whether the use of so much force and personal violence is necessary on shipboard , and why masters can not govern their crews by moral influences , and the general coercive fear of the law ? The best answer to this is , that crews might be governed more in that way , if the masters were qualified for doing it . But an elevation of intellectual and moral character , and a superiority of manners and deportment , are necessary to give efficiency to such mere abstractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the government of rough and uneducated men ; and , where these qualities are wanting , brute force must and will take their place . Not only so , but this force must be , to a certain extent , sustained by the law , which considers that the authority is to be supported at all events , even though somewhat rudely exercised . Now , we would ask , in what way can a change so desirable be brought about more surely , in codperation with that religious influence which is doing so much for both masters and seamen , than by a class of coinmanders , possessing a good early education , and the manners and feelings of well-bred gentlemen ; qualities which may be sometimes , but not often , found among those whose tender years have been passed in a forecastle . In defending the practice of young men of good education ( meaning by that term not merely the education of the school , but also that of the family and of society , ) entering the merchant service at a less early age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to guard against a misapprehension of our views . We do not advocate the coming in through the cabin windows . On the contrary , we know that // the service is not to be trifled with , and that two or three years before the mast , and as many more in the lower offices , are necessary to that practical acquaintance and familiarity with ship 's duty , - the various kinds of work , the properties and capabilities of the vessel , and of her spars and rigging , - without which the commander is little more than a master of ceremonies on board his ship . Neither do we mean , that in this arduous service preference should be given to men otherwise favored by birth or fortune ; but that those young men , whether rich or poor , obscure or prominent by parentage , who are able to avail themselves of the advantages of an education , and of intercourse with good society during the few early years , say between fourteen and eighteen , when their minds and habits are forming , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , form a class of commanders by whom the discipline of the service will be more easily and steadily enforced , the credit and honor of the country and her commerce be elevated , and the interests of the owners and insurers be made no less safe against the perils of the sea and of uncertain navigation , and better represented before the merchants , consuls , and government tribunals of our own and other countries , than by those whose minds and manners , during their most susceptible years , have been formed amidst the ignorance , vice , vulgarity , and false notions of the forecastle , and of the associates of seamen in foreign ports . Not to detain our readers longer from the work before us , Mr. Cleveland 's first voyage , as commander , was made in the year 1795 , in the bark Enterprise , of Salem , belonging to a merchant much distinguished in the history of our early commerce , Elias Hasket Derby . He says , " In those almost primitive days of our commerce , a coppered vessel was scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long East India voyages , the barnacles and grass , which accumulated on the wooden sheathing , retarded the ship 's sailing so much , that a third more time , at least , *s required for the passages , than is needed since the practice of sheathing with copper has been adopted . A year , therefore , was generally consumed in a voyage to the Isle of France or Bourbon ; and mine was accomplished within that term . The success attending it was very satisfactory to my employer , of which he gave evidence in despatching me again , in the same vessel , on a voyage to Europe , and thence to Mocha , for a cargo of coffee . " - Vol. i. pp. 3 , 4. // While at Havre , making preparations for this second voyage , Mr. Cleveland received word from his employer , that the enterprise must he given up . Being thus at liberty to mark out a course for himself , he determined to undertake by means of his own funds , ( which , however , were very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage to the Isle of France and India . Finding a little cutter of thirty-eight tons ' hurden , which had been taken for debt , and could he bought low , he purchased it , and , prevailing upon two friends to invest a thousand dollars apiece in the venture , he added to that amount his own capital of fifteen hundred dollars , and laid out the whole in a cargo suited to the market of the Isle of France . The whole cost of the vessel and cargo , when fitted for sea , was four thousand eight hundred dollars . He remarks , " It is not probable , that the annals of commerce can furnish another example of an Indiaman and cargo being fitted out on so humble a scale . " The reader will soon discover , that a love of enterprise amounting to restlessness , and an almost desperate spirit of adventure , are the moving powers of the author 's life . Added to these , he seems to possess , for we know him only through his hook , great independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perseverance , and chivalric courage . Except by attributing to him all these qualities , the events related in the narrative can not be accounted for . The hazards of the voyage to India in this mere boat were so great , that the adventurer received many warnings , and much dissuasive advice from his friends , which he disregarded . He found , however , a greater obstacle in the unwillingness of seamen to engage in so perilous an undertaking and it was not until after difficulty and delay , that he succeeded in shipping three men , who , with the mate and himself , cornprised the whole crew . Being ready for sea , so great was his impatience , that he set sail in the midst of a stiff north wind blowing directly into the bay , with a heavy sea , and very inauspicious appearance of the sky . His voyage , and the manner of his departure , excited no little attention at Havre , and a crowd assembled on the pier-head , and cheered the vessel as she passed . While driving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burying press of sail , for the purpose of weath // ering Cape Barfleur , he carried away his bowsprit , split his foresail , and fell to leeward . To return to Havre , or to go on a lee shore , was the only alternative . While attempting the former , he was again driven to leeward by the fierceness of the gale , the loss of his chief spar , and the heavy seas , setting him toward the shore . Nearing the breakers , he picked out a smooth beach which fortunately presented itself , and ran for it and let go his anchors . The cables soon parted , and , borne swiftly in on the top of a huge breaker , and enveloped in foam , the poor little vessel struck violently upon the ground , and , working deeper and further in the sand , was left by the receding tide . Here was a most mortifying and discouraging issue . But , when once fairly on shore , all subsequent events were favorable to the unfortunate vessel . The tide ebbed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered every assistance , and showed themselves exceedingly humane and honest in pilfering no part of the wrecked property , and in refusing any more than a moderate compensation for their services . The vessel was got off , carried round to Havre , and repaired ; the cargo , which was but little injured , was reshipped ; a new crew was procured , for the former crew were satisfied with one day 's experience of the voyage ; and once more , with the pier-head thronged , and three cheers from the crowd , our adventurer set sail upon his daring enterprise . In passing down the channel , he was boarded by an officer from Sir R. Strachan 's frigate , who , after causing as little detention as possible , complimented him by expressing his admiration of so bold an undertaking . The author 's description of his extraordinary crew is very amusing . He might well doubt if he should ever look upon their like again . " A sufficient time had now elapsed , since leaving Havre , ( it being the third day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew ; whose characters , peculiarities , and accomplishments were such , that a sketch of them may not be without interest to the reader . My mate , Reuben Barnes , was a young man of nineteen or twenty , a native of Nantucket , who , having been engaged in the whale fishery , had profited by that excellent school to acquire , not only the knowledge of the seaman 's profession , but also enough of the mechanic arts to fish a spar with dexterity , to caulk a seam , or to make a bucket or a barrel . // The intelligence , activity , watchfulness , and adroitness of this young man relieved me from much anxiety and care ; and in his conduct while with me , he evinced all the steadiness and fidelity , which the recommendation he brought , as well as the place of his birth , had led me to expect . " Decidedly the most important personage of my foremast hands was the black man George , who had dared to embark on our second voyage , after having shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capacity , and dialect , George was the veriest negro that can be imagined . For honesty , fidelity , and courage , he may have been equalled , but can never have been surpassed . He stood about six feet and three inches , was rather slender , very awkward , and of a much more sable hue than common , but with an expression of countenance mild and pleasing . With simplicity of character approximating to folly , he united a degree of self-conceit , which led him to believe , that he could do whatever could be done by another , and , in some cases , to suppose he could make great improvements ; an instance of which occurred before we had been out a week . In his previous voyages George had been cook , and had therefore nothing to do with the compass ; but now , having to take his regular turn at steering , he was greatly puzzled with its unsteadiness . He could steer in the night with tolerable accuracy , by giving him a star by which to steer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embarrass . With a view of remedying this difficulty , George had taken off the cover to the till of his chest , on which having marked the points of the compass , and pierced a hole in the centre for the pivot , he brought it aft , and with great appearance of complacency , and expectation of applause , placed it on deck before the helmsman , with the proper point directed forward to correspond with the course , and then exclaimed , Dair , massa , dat compass be teady ; George teer by him , well as anybody . ' " * * * * * " At the tune he engaged with me , he had been a sailor about two years , and had been so invariably cheated out of his wages , that he had no other means of clothing himself than the advance I paid him . Such treatment had been productive of a tinge of misanthropy ; and it was not until after long acquaintance , that he gave me his entire confidence . As this acquaintance continued for many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as he was a sharer of my various adventures , I shall have frequent occasion to mention his name in connexion with my own , while narrating them . " My other man had been a Prussian grenadier . lie had // served in the army of the Duke of Brunswick , at the time of his invading Holland to restore the authority of the Stadtholder , and in other campaigns ; but , having a dislike to the profession , he had deserted , and had been , ahout eighteen months , a sailor in English vessels . During this time he had not acquired such a knowledge of steering , that we could leave him at the helm without watching him ; and , however hrave he may have been in the ranks , he was the veriest coward imaginable , when called to the performance of duties aloft . In addition to this incapacity , he possessed a most ungovernable temper ; and , being a powerful man , we had considerable difficulty in keeping him , at all times , in a state of subordination ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his very imperfect knowledge of our language , and the consequent embarrassment he found in making himself understood . " The last , as well as least , of our numbers was a little French boy of fourteen years , who possessed all the vivacity peculiar to his countrymen , and who , having been some time on hoard the Carmagnole and other privateers , bad acquired many of the tricks of a finished man-of-war 's man . Some months ' residence in an English prison had given him the command of a few English words ; hut they were not of a selection that indicated much care in the teacher . " It was not uncommon for George , the Prussian grenadier , and the French boy , to get into a warm debate on the relative merits of their respective countries ; for they were all men of great vivacity and patriotism ; and sometimes ( probably from not understanding each other ) they would become so angry , as to render it necessary for the mate to interfere to restore tranquillity . At such moments I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an observer , his genius would have done justice to the group . It may fairly be presumed , however , that such a ship 's company , for an India voyage , was never before seen , and , moreover , that we ne'er shall look upon its like again . ' " For several days after passing the Isle of Ushant , the wind was light from northwest and west-northwest , accompanied with a heavy swell from that quarter ; and though our progress was , in consequence , slow , it was proportionally comfortable . Before we had reached the latitude of Cape Finisterre , the light wind , before which we had been sailing with all our canvass spread , died away , and left us some hours becalmed . During this time one of our pigs had got overboard , and was swimming away from the vessel . George , being an excellent swimmer , did not hesitate to go after him ; but , when he had caught him , at the distance from us of about twenty fathoms , a light puff of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the sails aback , and suddenly increased our distance from George , who , perceiving it , and becoming alarmed , let go the pig , and swam for the vessel , crying out lustily , as he approached , I dead , I dead . ' As he had not been long in the water , nor used such exertion as to cause extraordinary exhaustion , I was apprehensive that he might be attacked by a shark . We threw towards him a spar , and set immediately about clearing away the boat ; but before we could be ready to launch it , George had seized the spar , and , by its aid , had succeeded in getting along-side . When taken on board he did not hesitate to express his belief , that our going from him was intentional , and that , had the breeze continued , we should have left him for the purpose of saving his wages . Nor was it until after long experience , and repeatedly receiving his wages when due , that he would acknowledge that he had judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next incident is described as follows " On a very fine morning , as the sun rose , and when we were about fifty leagues west of Cadiz , we perceived a small sail in the northwest . At ten o'clock she was equally plain to he seen ; and by noon we were satisfied she was in chase of , and was gaining on us . We kept steadily on our course , hoping that an increase of wind would give us an advantage , or that some other object might divert their attention . But our hopes were fallacious . The wind rather decreased ; and , when this was the case , we observed she appeared to approach us faster . By two o'clock we perceived she had latteen sails , and hence had no doubt of her being a privateer . Soon after she began to fire at us , but the balls fell much short . As the wind continued very light , it was soon apparent , that we could not escape , as we perceived that her progress was accelerated by means of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been incurring the risk of irritating the captain of the buccaneer ; we therefore rounded to , and prepared to be plundered . " As they came up with us , about five o'clock , they gave such a shout of Bonne prise ! honne prise ! ' as would be expected from banditti subject to no control ; but I felt considerable relief in the persuasion , that , as their flag indicated , they were French , and not Spanish . After the shouting had ceased , I was ordered , in very coarse terms , to hoist out my boat and come on board with my papers . I replied that I had not men sufficient to put out the boat . The order was reiterated , accompanied with a threat of firing into us . I then sent my men below , and waited the result , which was , that they got out their own boat . The // officer , who came on board , I suppose to have been the captain himself , from the circumstance of his being a very intelligent man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privateer . A cursory examination of our papers convinced him of our neutral character ; and the exhibition of a passport with a seal and signature of one high in authority in the French government , *vbile it astonished , seemed also to satisfy him , that the less trouble and detention he gave us the better ; as he immediately ordered his ruffians to desist from clearing away for opening the hatches , which they had already begun , and to go on board their boat , where , after wishing me a good voyage , and regretting the detention he had caused , he joined them and they returned to their privateer and sailed in pursuit of other adventures . " The result of this rencontre was better than I had anticipated ; aware , as I was , of the general insubordination on hoard of vessels of this description .

Christian , and Lord Macartney , the Governor . " The arrival of such a vessel from Europe naturally excited the curiosity of the inhabitants of the Cape ; and the next morning being calm , we had numerous visiters on board , who could not disguise their astonishment at the size of the vessel , the boyish appearance of the master and mate , the queer and unique characters of the two men and boy who constituted the crew , and the length of the passage we had accomplished .

He laid the matter before Lord Macartney in a letter , which he delivered to him in person , and which resulted in an immediate and satisfactory adjustment of the affair . The second day after Mr. Cleveland left his cutter she was put under the charge of a lieutenant and a competent number of men , and sent with despatches to India ; but was never heard of afterwards . The author justly remarks , " It is probable , the officer in charge , having been accustomed only to large and square-rigged vessels , was not aware of the delicacy of management , which One so small and differently rigged , required ; and to this her loss may be attributed .

Batavia , with its white , plastered houses , bilious and emaciated foreigners , stagnant canals , tawdry and expensive hotels , hung with blue and gold , and green and gold bands of slaves playing at meal times , sharks and alligators in the hay , and good pine-apples and bad beef and mutton in the market , is next described .

Our ships sailed so nearly alike , that no day passed when we were not within speaking distance ; and , when the weather was fine , and the sea smooth , which was often the case , we exchanged visits . The commodore had a band on board ; and in the bright moonlight even* // ings , when the breeze was only sufficient to keep the sails from flapping against the masts , and the ripple of the ship 's passage through the water scarcely heard , the music of this hand was so delightful , that it even now brings back the most pleasing associations , whenever memory retraces the incidents of this passage .

Having purchased a small cutter of about fifty tons ' burden , he fitted her out for the Northwest Coast with a cargo procured by his eleven thousand dollars , and seven thousand loaned to him by two friends . It is a sufficient comment upon the judiciousness of this adventure in a commercial point of view , to state , in advance of the story , that the furs procured for this cargo sold at Canton , seven months afterwards , for sixty thousand dollars . All this had been effected by his two thousand at home , with the aid of the twenty-five hundred lent to him there , and the seven thousand procured from his friends at Canton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was in Canton in the winter of 1798-9 , speak of Mr. Cleveland and his adventure . It was somewhat in this manner . " I remember Cleveland well . We lived at the same factory . He was a small , slender man , with a dark complexion ; quiet and unobtrusive in his manners , rather taciturn , and drank nothing stronger than cold water . Yet he was as quick as steel and flint . He used to walk his chamber in the factory , to and fro , in his dressing gown and slippers , with his mind constantly at work upon plans and contrivances for commercial adventure . There was a good deal of knight-errantry in these exploits of his . The passage up the coast against the height of the monsoon was looked upon as madness by the foreign residents , who had been used to the old style of merchantmen coming and going in fleets with the regularity of the monsoons themselves , and no business doing in the intervals . Such a breach upon // routine , and such an inverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encouraged . We all felt proud of him when he came back successful . " Mr. Cleveland 's object in beating up the coast at that time , was to reach the Northwest Coast before the arrival of certain vessels , which he had heard were fitting out from Boston . He gives the following characteristic reason for being emboldened in his undertaking . " I was also more encouraged to make the trial , as I could not learn that it had ever been attempted at the same season of the year ; consequently , that my advisers were not warranted in declaring so confidently that it was impracticable . " We commend to the attention of our readers , the following extracts from the narrative of a passage up the coast of China . " To procure a competent number of men was a task of such difficulty , that , when any one offered his services , I was not very particular in inquiring whence he came , or how well he was qualified ; it was sufficient for my purpose if he was a white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was indispensable to our safety with the Indians , that our crew should be composed of Europeans or Americans . Most of my men were deserters from Indiamen ; and these were generally the worst of a bad crew . With such as I could procure , however , I at length completed my complement , sixteen men before the mast , fourteen of whom were English and Irish , and two Americans . In the cabin we were five in number , including George , who acted as steward , and the linguist ; making together twenty.one . The vessel was remarkably strong and well built ; well coppered ; mounted ten brass four-pound cannon ; with a proper number of muskets , pistols , pikes , &amp;c. * * * * * " The course which appeared to me to offer the best prospect of success , though attended with more danger than either of the others , was to beat up along the shore of the coast of China . For I was persuaded that the small size of my vessel would enable me to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable current ; to he protected , occasionally , by a projecting point , from the roughness of the sea ; and to come to anchor when it appeared that we were losing ground . * * * * * " I sailed from Anson 's Bay on the 10th of January , 1799 , in the morning . Having a strong breeze , we passed Macao // Roads at four P. M. , at a long distance from the shipping , fearing we might be brought to , and our men taken out . During the night , we passed between the Lama Islands and very near to one of them ; which I ventured to do , from the local knowledge possessed by the chief mate . The inconvenience arising from the want of a chart of the coast and Islands , was immediately experienced . The small and imperfect one I possessed was not of the least use , and hence our utmost vigilance was constantly required . In the morning and forenoon of the 11th , we made several tacks off and on ; but the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh breeze and smooth sea , we gained nothing to windward ; and , as we had not been able to complete our watering and wooding at Anson s Bay , we went in and anchored near a small fishing town for this purpose . " Here , we were soon visited by as great a number of the inhabitants as boats could be found to convey . Both old and young , of either sex , came off to see the Fanquis , as they called us . Among them , was one who spoke the Portuguese language ; and who , for a moderate compensation , procured for us the supply we required . In the mean time , the numbers had greatly increased , and evinced a strong desire to come on board . As it would have been very imprudent to permit this , I found myself obliged to station men in different parts of the vessel , with boarding pikes , to keep them off . " In the afternoon , the current appearing to have diminished , we weighed anchor , and perceived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there were appearances of bad weather , and we were abreast a deep bay which promised a shelter , we ran in and came to anchor ; and thus escaped the fatigue and danger of a stormy night at sea The next day , ( 13th , ) having but a light breeze , we used our sweeps ; by the aid of which , and keeping close in shore , we advanced a little . In beating through a narrow strait , formed by a point of the coast and a rocky island , against which the sea broke with great fury , and at the critical moment , when passing not more than fifteen yards to windward , the peak halyards slipped from the pin to which they were belayed , and the peak of the mainsail ran down . As all hands were on deck , it was instantly hoisted again ; but such was the force of the swell , the wind being light , that before we had got by we were thrown so near the rock as to reach it with an oar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind from east-northeast , blowing in the night very strong , which caused a considerable increase of sea . This obliged us to carry a press of sail , and presently our jib // split ; we then reefed the mainsail , set a second-sized jib , and a little after midnight tacked in shore . " At daylight of the 14th , we were not a little elated to find ourselves considerably to windward of the place we left the last evening , notwithstanding a rough sea . We continued all day successfully plying to windward , and in the evening , it being calm , we anchored in fifteen fathoms . * * * * * " We stood off shore until two o'clock on the morning of the 18th , and then tacked towards the land ; in expectation , that , as we had cnrried as much sail all night as the vessel would bear , we should gain very considerably to windward ; but , at daylight , had the disappointment to find ourselves at least three leagues to leeward of the land we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so short a time , was very discouraging ; for , with our greatest exertions , we could hardly hope to regain it in twentyfour hours . This also convinced me , that we could do nothing by keeping far from the shore . In the evening , as well as throughout the succeeding night , a breeze from the land favored us very much ; and , by keeping close in , we gained even more than our preceding day 's loss . * * * * * " Keeping our lead constantly going , we had very irregular soundings , from five to two and a half fathoms ; when , suddenly , as we were sailing at the rate of about three knots , we ran upon a sunken ledge . As the vessel hung only forward , we lowered the sails and hoisted out the boat , with a view to carry out an anchor astern ; but unfortunately , in putting the anchor into the boat , the bill of it struck with such force against one of the planks in the bottom as to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraging circumstance , as the vessel lay very uneasy ; but there was no other resource than to hoist the boat again on deck , and stop the leak in the most expeditious way possible . While we were thus engaged , the tide rose so much , that the vessel slid off the rock , unaided by any efforts of ours ; and apparently without having received any injury . Our latitude was 2*2O 35 ' north . * * * * * " We now were encouraged by the discovery , that we had regular tides setting north and south ; and as soon as it began to set in our favor , on the 20th , we weighed anchor and began beating . But , having a short , irregular sea to contend with , we made but little progress during the day ; and so entirely did the coast appear to be strewed with rocks and shoals , that it could not be approached in the night , without the most imminent // danger of losing our vessel ; hence the necessity of finding an anchorage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing this , hy running in where there was a number of junks at anchor ; and near a considerable settlement , before which appeared to be a fort . * * * * * " It appeared as if these people had never before seen a European , or American . They followed him the mate in crowds to the fort , and back again to the landing-place . All labor , for the time , was abandoned ; and even the actors , who were then engaged on a public stage , suspended their sing-song , while the fanqui ' was passing . * * * * * " Approaching the coast , and when within ahout three leagues of it , we suddenly perceived a breaker ; hut , as the vessel was going at a rapid rate , we were in the midst of the foam almost at the moment of this discovery . The vessel struck once , in the hollow of the sea , and was enveloped in the succeeding hillow , but passed over without receiving any injury ; her deck , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had now become essential that we should find a harbour ; as we could do no more than drift to leeward by remaining out . But to seek one , in a gale of wind , without a chart , and on a coast to which we were all strangers , was attended with great hazard . When we had run about four leagues to leeward , the man at mast-head perceived a deep , sandy hay , the access to which appeared to be free from danger ; and the sea was now so high , that any shoal which could take us up , would show itself . We therefore ran boldly in , and doubling round a projecting point of sand , came to anchor near a fleet of junks ; which we found were bound north , and had , like ourselves , put in to evade the storm . The gale continued throughout this and the following day , accompanied with frequent and heavy squalls of rain ; and the weather as cold as it is commonly in Boston , in the month of December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfort , afforded hy lying two days and a night in so smooth a harbour , while the storm was howling , and the sea roaring without , were almost beyond the power of description . * * * * * " We perceived , during this day , that when working up in smooth water , sometimes caused by a projecting point , our vessel was decidedly superior to the junks in sailing ; but that when we got out where the sea was rough , they had as much the advantage of us ; indeed , I was astonished to perceive how fast such // square , uncouth , ill-shaped craft , with bamboo sails , would work to windward in a sea , which almost buried my cutter . * * * * * " Some very neat houses , surrounded with trees and shrubbery , and having the appearance of country-seats of opulent men , were beautifully situated on the side of a hill opposite to the spot where we had anchored ; and the whole island , of apparently not more than two miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the day , we had passed several considerable settlements , one of which had a wall round it ; and the country , generally , exhibited an appearance of great cultivation . " - Vol. i. pp. 49- 60 . The extracts above made , will give the reader some notion of the manner in which this bold adventure was performed . He will recollect , too , that Mr. Cleveland had no chart of the coast , and that the attempt had never , to his knowledge , been made before . During this passage he quelled , in a manner showing dauntless courage and great firmness , a mutiny , which threatened to destroy the vessel and the enterprise together . Six of the crew , who would not submit to his terms , were left on shore among the Chinese , at a place where , perhaps , a European had never been seen before , and were by them sent down to Canton . The author thus simply announces the completion of his effort . " With various winds and weather , we diligently pursued our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of the monsoon ; and on the 11th of February , had the satisfaction of seeing the north end of Formosa , bearing south , distant ten leagues . Thus , after thirty-one days of great toil , exposure , and anxiety , we had accomplished that part of our passage , which had been represented as an impossibility ; and which , with a fair wind , might have been performed in three days . " - Vol. i. p. 67 . A boisterous passage of forty-seven days , brings our adventurer to the Northwest Coast , the approach to which , with the few first days upon it , are thus picturesquely set forth . " Early in the morning of the 30th of March , we saw the usual indications of land , drift-wood , kelp , and gulls ; and at ten o'clock perceived the snow-capped hills of the American coast , twelve leagues distant . We immediately set all hands to work in bending our cables and getting up a bulwark , which we had been preparing of hides sewed together . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely screened us from being seen by the natives , whom it was important to our safety to keep in ignorance of our numbers . Towards evening we anchored in a snug harbour at Norfolk Sound , in latitude 570 10 ' north . Here the smoothness of the water , the feeling of safety , and the silent tranquillity which reigned all round us , formed a striking contrast to the scenes with which we had been familiar since leaving Canton ; and would have afforded positive enjoyment , had I possessed a crew on whose fidelity I could depend . **rfhe following day was very clear and pleasant . At the first dawn of the morning we discharged a cannon to apprize any natives who might be near , of our arrival . We then loaded the cannon and a number of muskets and pistols , which were placed where they could be most readily laid hold of . The only accessible part of the vessel was the stern , and this was exclusively used ( while it was necessary to keep up the bulwark ) as the gangway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trade , I had mounted there two four-pound cannon ; and on the tafferel a pair of blunderbusses on swivels , which were also loaded . Soon after the discharge of our cannon , several indians came to us ; and before dark some hundreds had arrived , who encamped on the beach near which the vessel was anchored . As we observed them to be loaded with skins , we supposed that we were the first who had arrived this season . " With a view to our owa security , as well as convenience , I directed my interpreter to explain to the chiefs , and through them to the tribe , that after dark no canoe would be allowed to come near the vessel ; and that , if I perceived any one approaching , I should fire at it ; that only three or four canoes must come at a time to trade , and that they must always appear under the stern , avoiding the sides of the vessel . With my own men I neglected no precaution to make escape impossible , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were divided into three watches . One of these I took charge of ; and stationing them in such parts of the vessel that no movement could he made undiscovered , obliged them to strike the gong every half hour throughout the night , and to call out , from each end of the vessel and amidships , All s well . ' This practice so amused the Indians , that they imitated it by striking a tin kettle , and repeating the words as near as they were able . " - Vol. i. pp. 69-71 . Any one , who has seen or dealt with the Indians on the Northwest Coast , will take no little pleasure in the following picture our author gives of them . // " But a more hideous set of beings , in the form of men and women , I had never before seen . The fantastic manner in which many of the faces of the men were painted , was probably intended to give them a ferocious appearance ; and some groups looked really as if they had escaped from the dominions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two sides of the face ; one side of which was painted red , the other , black ; with the hair daubed with grease and red ochre , and filled with the white down of birds . Another had the face divided with a horizontal line in the middle , and painted black and white . The visage of a third was painted in checkers , &amp;c . Most of them had little mirrors ; before the acquisition of which , they must have been dependent on each other for those correct touches of the pencil , which are so much in vogue , and which daily require more time than the toilet of a Parisian belle . " The women made , if possible , a still more frightful appearance . The ornament of wood which they wear to extend an incision made beneath the under lip , so distorts the face as to take from it almost the resemblance to the human ; yet the privilege of wearing this ornament is not extended to the female slaves , who are prisoners taken in war . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most rude state of society . It is difficult , however , for the imagination to conceive of more disgusting and filthy beings than these patrician dames. " - Vol. r. pp. 71 , 72 . The various countries of Europe have been be-toured , and be-journalled bard and dry , and even Mont Blanc has become a sort of Macadamized Parnassus ; but we believe our readers will have no reason to find fault with us , for giving them a few extracts from the narrative of Mr. Cleveland 's sojourn upon this distant and mostly undescribed coast . " Unexpectedly , one of these very great chiefs arrived the next day in a canoe quite as long as my vessel , and ornamented with a rudely carved figure of a warrior on the prow , the head of which was decorated with real hair , filled with a mixture of grease and red ochre , and the white down of birds . The chief was a dignified , good-looking man of about forty-five . He was accompanied by twenty-two athletic young men , who appeared to handle their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management of the ordinary canoes , as the oarsmen of a man-of-war 's barge surpass those of a merchantman . This chief was very desirous to come on board ; but to have indulged him would have been an imprudent exposure of the smallness of our numbers . He then expressed a wish to // have a cannon discharged ; and we readily fired two in immediate succession , which appeared to astonish and gratify him , and on the subject of which much conversation was held with his men ; but it was only partially understood by my linguist as expressing admiration of the report . After this , the chief stood up and made a speech , evincing his pleasure , and at the same time handing up three fine skins as presents . An Indian 's gift is understood here , as elsewhere , to be made with the expectation of a generous return ; and I gave to the chief great coats , cloth , knives , beads , and China cash , to more than their value . He drank half a tumbler of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantity of the down of birds in token of friendship . As they left us to go ashore , they all began a song , whose wildness was in perfect keeping with their appearance , and to which they kept the most exact time with their paddles . " The days of the 18th and 19th were rainy and unpleasant . We continued at anchor , and were visited by a number of Indians with skins ; but they did not trade with much spirit . The rainy , chilly weather seemed to have checked their animation ; and they would sit , crouched up in their canoes , looking at us for hours together , without altering their position , while it rained without cessation . At length we observed a very old chief earnestly engaged to get his canoe nearer to us ; as I supposed to sell his furs and be off . But not so ; his object was to persuade me to cause the rain to cease ; and , as an inducement , he assured me , they would bring a great many skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him I could not do so that day , but might possibly the next . It happened that the next day was fair ; but I saw nothing more of the chief . * * * * * " The wind , having subsided during the night , was succeeded by a calm . This being favorable for the canoes , they arrived in surprising numbers . We had witnessed nothing to be compared with it since our arrival on the coast . Coming in divisions of four or five each , by ten o'clock twenty-six were assembled in the cove , some of which were as long as my vessel , and carrying from twelve to twenty-eight persons each , making an aggregate of about five hundred men , all well armed with muskets , spears , and daggers . They were unaccompanied by their women and children , and had but few skins , which was a certain indication , that their intentions were of a hostile character . " It will be perceived , that our situation was now one of great danger . The calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was obvious , that if they attacked us with resolution , their great superiority of numbers would enable them to // overwhelm us , before the guns could be reloaded after the first discharge . Our only alternative , then , was to make the best preparation in our power for repelling an attack , and to sell our lives as dearly as possible ; for our men were all convinced , that death was greatly to be preferred to falling alive into the hands of these barbarians . Accordingly , our cannon were all loaded with bags of musket balls . Our small arms , two muskets and two pistols for each man , were also loaded ; and our pikes placed at hand . " The Indians passed most of the day in their canoes , keeping at about a cable 's length distant from our vessel , continually endeavouring to persuade us to let them approach , by the assurance of having a great many skins . Our own men , at the same time , with lighted matches , were all day at the guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while our linguist was calling to them not to advance , on pain of destruction from the great guns . In this hostile attitude each party remained all day . In the forenoon we observed two large canoes to go away , which , returning before night , we supposed might have been sent for reinforcements . The day had been a long and anxious one ; and when night came , we were rejoiced to see them go on shore , haul up their canoes , and build their fires . They remained quiet during the night , except mocking our watch , as each half hour was called out . Early next morning , there sprang up a breeze from the northward , when we got under way , and proceeded out of the cove , the Indians begging us to remain another day , and promising us a great many skins . We had scarcely got into the broad part of the sound , before we met two war canoes , each containing twentysix men , well armed , who were on their way to join the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed . Of these I purchased four skins in passing ; and they were exceedingly anxious we should return and anchor again , assuring us of a great many skins . On perceiving their persuasions to he of no avail , they showed evident demonstrations of great disappointment . " - Vol. x. pp. 77- 83 . The next adventure is a perilous one , in which the author was saved from almost certain wreck . " The next day , while steering to the westward and going at the rate of about two knots , unsuspicious of danger , the vessel suddenly struck a sunken ledge , and stopped . Perceiving that she hung abaft the midships , and that there were three and a half fathoms under the bows , we immediately run all the guns forward , and carried out an anchor ahead ; // but the tide ebbed so rapidly , that our efforts to heave her off were ineffectual . We therefore heeled her on the side , whence she would be less likely to roll over . At low water the position of the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could escape bilging . She hung by about four feet amidships , having slid about as much on the rock as the tide fell , and brought up with the end of the bowsprit against the bottom . Her keel formed an angle of forty-five degrees with the water line , the after part of it being from fourteen to fifteen feet above the rock . This position , combined with a rank heel to starboard , rendered it impossible to stand on deck . We therefore put a number of loaded muskets into the boat , and prepared for such resistance , in case of being attacked , as could be made by fifteen men , crowded into a sixteen-feet boat . " Our situation was now one of the most painful anxiety , no less from the immediate prospect of losing our vessel , and the rich cargo we had collected with so much toil , than from the apprehension of being discovered in this defenceless state by some one of the hostile tribes by which we were surrounded . A canoe of the largest class , with thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half an hour before we struck , who were now prevented from seeing us by having passed round an island . Should the vessel bilge there existed scarcely any other chance for the preservation of our lives , than the precarious one of falling in with some ship . That she would bilge there was no reason to doubt , if the weather varied in any degree from that perfect calm which then prevailed . More than ten hours were passed in this agonizing state of suspense , watching the horizon to discover if any savages were approaching , - the heavens , if there were a cloud that might chance to ruffle the smooth surface of the water , - the vessel , whose occasional cracking seemed to warn us of destruction ; and , when the tide began to flow , impatiently observing its apparently sluggish advance , while I involuntarily consulted my watch , the hands of which seemed to have forgotten to move . In this painful interval , I beguiled some little time , while seated in the boat , by taking a sketch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearing that it might soon be beyond my power to give such evidence of her sad fate . " At length , the water having flowed over the coamings of the hatches , which had been caulked down in anticipation of this event , without any indication of the vessel 's lifting , I was deliberating on the propriety of cutting away the mast , when we perceived her to be rising . She soon after righted so much , that we could go on board ; and at half past twelve in the night // we had the indescribable pleasure of seeing her afloat again , without having received any other apparent injury than the loss of a few sheets of copper . " - Vol. i. pp. 84- 86 . The following is a beautiful description of a little landlocked bay in Norfolk Sound . " In the afternoon the south wind increased greatly , and caused such a sea as latterly we had been entirely unaccustomed to . As much fatigue and some risk would be incurred by attempting to pass the night in tacking to and fro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was so high and the sea so rough , of advancing at all on our way , it became very desirable to find a harbour ; and a little before sunset , being near the eastern side of the sound , we perceived an opening of about a fourth of a mile , between two precipitous hills , clothed from the bottom to their summits with pine . The hills on each side forming the entrance were so decisively indicative of sufficient depth of water , that we ran boldly in , without taking the precaution of first sending the boat to reconnoitre . We were immediately becalmed on passing the entrance , and , using our sweeps , rowed but a third of a mile before we were in perfectly smooth water . The passage having become narrower as we had advanced in it , rendered anchoring unnecessary ; and we kept the vessel suspended , between the two shores , by ropes made fast to the trees . " Our position was quite romantic . The thick-wooded hills on either side seemed almost to unite at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tranquillity which had so instantaneously succeeded the roar and turbulence of the sea without ; and the comfort and security for the night of which we had a prospect , all combined to produce sensations of a most pleasing character . " - Vol. i. pp. 87 , 88 . Few can read without emotion the following account of the feeling shown by a young Indian chief . " Being so nearly on the point of leaving the coast , and therefore fearing no bad consequences from an exposure of our weakness , I acceded to the earnest solicitations of this young warrior to come on board . This was the only one of the natives whom we had admitted on board since being on the coast . We invited him into the cabin , and gave him a glass of wine , which pleased him so much , that he soon asked for another . Having made me a present of a very fine skin , I made a return of a shirt , jacket , and pantaloons , which he immediately put on , and appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // pleased with the dress . But the friendly feelings I had inspired suffered a momentary interruption , by my careless and apparently rude manner of giving him a handkerchief . Being on the opposite side of the cabin from that on which I was sitting , I threw it into his lap , when , instead of taking , he allowed it to roll down on the floor , his feelings so much wounded that he actually shed tears ; nor was it without considerable effort , that we persuaded him that no insult was intended , by assuring him that it arose from my ignorance of the etiquette which custom had established among them . This little interruption to our harmony was of short duration , the party aggrieved being satisfied with my apology ; and , having purchased of him and his comrades about sixty skins , we parted with mutual good-will and friendship . " - Vol. i. pp. 92 , 93 . Mr. Cleveland closes the narrative of his sojourn upon the Northwest Coast with the following significant passage . " I steered to the southwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than in the reflection of its having been attained without injury to the natives , or other than the most friendly interchange of commodities with them . " The meaning of this passage is explained by an extract from a subsequent page . " The abuse of power , in the most unprincipled and even cruel acts , has frequently been charged to our countrymen , while pursuing their avocations in these distant regions , and I am sorry to say not without foundation . To such conduct may reasonably be attributed the hostility of the Indians , the loss of many innocent lives , and much property . " - Vol. i. p. 234. i'lr . Cleveland 's admission of the truth of these charges shows firmness of mind , and his avoiding all such acts himself , and the tone of his feelings with reference to them , give us great confidence in his moral qualities . Indeed the history of commerce , and especially though not exclusively of American commerce , in the South Seas and upon the Northwest Coast , is too much one of violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one having the feelings of a Christian or a man . The " forced trade " is yet known , at least by some , among the adventurers of the Pacific Ocean . But we shall have occasion to remark upon this subject a little more fully hereafter . On his way hack to Canton , Mr. Cleveland gives us a hasty sketch of the Sandwich Islands , at which he merely // touched in passing . The parallel here drawn we believe to be just . " The contrast , which their cleanliness forms with the filthy appearance of the natives of the Northwest Coast , will not fail to attract the attention of the most unobserving . Nor have they less advantage over their Northwest neighbours in the size , shape , and gracefulness of their persons , and in the open , laughing , generous , and animated expression of their countenances . The characteristics of these islanders are activity , gayety , volatility , and irritability ; those of the Northwest Indians , heaviness , melancholy , austerity , ferocity , and treachery . They are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred to be the effect of climate operating on the materials of rude and savage characters . " - Vol. i. p. 97 . After a short stay at Canton , our adventurer went , by way of Malacca , of which he gives a passing sketch , to Calcutta , where he arrived in the last fortnight of the eighteenth century . Mr. Cleveland has well described the city of Calcutta , at which he spent about three months , the surrounding country , and the ways of the inhabitants ; but this is familiar ground to the reader . The only incident of much importance that occurred to himself was the nearly losing his man George , and the narrow escape of that invaluable man from a long service in a British man-of-war . George had been impressed as a seaman , and having informed the officer that he was a private servant to an American , word was sent to Mr. Cleveland to come and prove his claim to him . Instead of going in person , Mr. Cleveland sent a note . This was considered disrespectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and George did not appear . Mr. Cleveland became alarmed , made inquiries , and found that he had been put on board an Indiaman . This announcement brought about an interview with His Worship , a fat magistrate , who would do nothing for either party . Mr. Cleveland then applied immediately to head-quarters , and stated his case plainly and simply in a letter to Lord Mornington ( Marquis Wellesley ) , the Governor-General ; and , although the ship was lying several miles down the river , George made his appearance early the next morning , accompanied by a sergeant , who had been sent to conduct him . A life of ease at Calcutta was not for such as our author . // Seeing that a great number of prizes had been taken into the Isle of France , he thought that a condemned vessel and cargo could be purchased there for a small sum ; but , as the English were at open war , and the Americans in a quasi war with the French , how to get there with his property presented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited our adventurer to greater effort . The Danes were at this time the only neutrals ; accordingly , at the Danish settlement of Serampore , he purchased a boat of twenty-five tons , put her under Danish colors , with a Danish master , and ordered him to wait for him below the city . Taking passage in a native boat , he joined his own , with his property in bills and gold mohurs , George and himself being in the capacity of passengers . In this boat , with thunder , lightning , squalls , rain , and a scorching vertical sun , they made a passage of fortyfive days to the Isle of France . The narrative of the author 's residence of ten months at this island , and of his observations upon the various subjects which attracted the attention of his active and acute mind , will well repay the attention of the reader . We shall extract only a few , which relate to events not local or temporary in all their bearings . General Malartie , the excellent Governor of the Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes . War was then raging between France and England ; and we agree with the author , that the horrors of war would be much assuaged , were all commanders capable of such high-minded courtesies as the Admiral here spoken of . " A few days previous , the English blockading squadron had arrived , under command of Commodore Jiotham . These , on the day of the funeral obsequies , as a mark of respect for the deceased general , came down from windward , and lay by , off the entrance of the harbour , with their colors hoisted half.mast , and firing minute guns . Such a tribute of respect from an enemy is so magnanimous , that it can not fail to be considered honorable to both parties ; and , while such acts meet the applause of the civilized world , they will also have their influence in dimin. ishing the asperities and miseries of war . " - Vol. i. p. 130 . The sequel shows , too , that the courtesies of war and respect for the dead are not inconsistent with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " A few days after giving this evidence of respect and courtesy , the squadron gave us an exhibition of character of a different kind . A Hamburgh ship had , during the night , got between the squadron and the land , and at daylight was discovered by them several miles to leeward , and near Round Island . All sail was made by the squadron in chase ; and , although they were fast approaching him , the Hamburgher persevered in pushing for the port , with a boldness and determination which greatly excited the sympathy of the multitudes , who were watching , with intense interest , the result . Before he had got quite up with the fort at the entrance of the port , the Lancaster , of sixty-four guns , passed so near to him ( outside ) that the balls from her broadside passed over and came ashore . Then the Adamant , of fifty guns , as near , fired her broadside with as little effect ; and , there being no time for repeating them , the ship got in safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the assembled multitude . It is difficult to conceive how two such formidable broadsides could be directed , from so short a distance , against so large an object without destroying it ; and that they produced no injury , seemed almost miraculous . The ship was immediately warped up , and moored near to the guard ship . But the English Commodore was determined not to be outdone in enterprise . And , although his prospect of success seemed as hopeless as the escape of the 11amburgher had done in the morning , he sent in his boats about ten o'clock the same evening , of which we had notice by the roar of cannon from the guard ship and from the forts , and , in defiance of these , actually carried the ship off , while the crew supposed themselves to be in such perfect safety , that the broker was on board taking a list of the articles composing the cargo. * ' - Vol. i. pp. 103 , 131 . The arrival of the Confiance privateer , Captain Surcouffe , with her prize , the Kent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traveller , with upwards of one hundred thousand dollars in specie on board , were the next events of interest that occurred at the Island . This condemnation was considered unjust by all the Americans on the Island at the time , and it would seem from the author 's expressions , that , between the Jacobins and the armateurs , the well intending hut vacillating Governor had little ability to carry out his just views of right . In the mean time the Kent was sold to a Dane , put under Danish papers , colors , and command , her name changed to the Cronberg , and offered for freight for Europe . Mr. Cleve // land , in conjunction with his friend Mr. Shaler , whom he here first met , and with whom his fortunes were intimately associated for thirty-three years afterwards , took the vessel , and embarked all their property in her on a voyage to the North of Europe . The stately Cronberg was a contrast indeed to the cutters and pilot-boats in which the last voyages of our adventurer had been made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship , with no care but to make myself comfortable , was entirely a novel situation to me . " After running many risks of capture , he arrived safely at Copenhagen , in June , 1801 , having been absent from Europe about four years . The two thousand dollars he then owned , had now become fortyfive thousand ; a result , he says , " very gratifying to me , if on no other consideration than the acquisition of independence hut it was vastly more so , from the circumstance of its enabling me to make comfortable and happy the latter years of a father , who , with a young family , was feeling the pressure of poverty ; of aged uncles and aunts , who had seen better days , and whose kindness to me required that I should leave nothing undone , which was in my power to do , to promote their happiness . " The reader will already have learned the nature of our author 's adventures , and the extracts given are sufficient to exhibit the excellent style and spirit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow them further in detail . It is enough to say that they are as various , as far in extremes , and as well adapted to keep the subject of them in a state of constant excitement , as the most insatiable seeker of adventures could desire . The next enterprise was a voyage to South America in the brig Lelia Byrd , undertaken in conjunction with his friend Mr. Shaler . They took with them , as a companion , an interesting and highly educated , but unfortunate young Polish gentleman , Count de Rouissillon . In the narrative of this adventure there are full and interesting descriptions of Canaria , Rio Janeiro , Cape Horn , Valparaiso , San Blas , the Gallipagos , and the Maria Islands . The visit to a cave , in the passage up the Pacific coast of America , to California , is too striking to be omitted here . " On the morning of the 16th of March , we were becalmed near St. Clement 's Island , where , perceiving a smoke , we landed // abreast of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side of a hill , by some overhanging rocks and earth , but insufficient to afford shelter from the weather , with any other than northerly winds . In this miserable domicil , resided eleven persons , men , women , and children ; and , though the temperature was such as to make our woollen garments requisite , they were all in a state of perfect nudity . Their food was exclusively fish , and , having no cooking utensils , their only resource was baking them in the earth . We could not perceive , that they possessed a word of any other dialect than their own , of which we understood nothing . I had been familiar with the Indians inhabiting various parts of the western coast of America , but never saw any so miserable , so abject , so spiritless , so nearly allied to the brute . " - Vol. i. p. 210 . As the affair at San Diego , in California , made a good deal of noise on the Mexican coast at the time , and is well described , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in passing . The object of our adventurers in visiting San Diego was to procure some sea-otter skins , which Mr. Cleveland had been informed were there for sale . The day after their ar-rival , " The Commandant , Don Manuel Rodriguez , with an escort of twelve dragoons , came down abreast of the ship , and requested that the boat might be sent for him . This being done immediately , he crowded the boat with his escort , and probably regretted the necessity of leaving on shore his horses . We had been told at San Blas , that Don Manuel was an exceedingly vain and pompous man ; and , indeed , we found him so ; for such a ridiculous display of a little brief authority , ' and pompous parade , I never before witnessed . His dress and every movement evinced the most arrant coxcomb . Having saluted us on coming over the ship 's side , he waited , before proceeding aft , until his escort were drawn up in two lines , with hats off in one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them to the companion-way . After the ordinary inquiries of whence we came , whither hound , and the object of our visit , he called to the officer of the escort , and desired him to take a minute of the articles we required . With these he said that he would supply us the next day ; on receiving which , he should expect we would not delay a moment in leaving the port . He counted our men , and , perceiving us to be only fifteen , all told , expressed astonishment at the presumption of undertaking so long and dangerous a navigation with so few men . He forbade our going // to the town , which is distant about three miles , but gave us leave to go on shore in the neighbourhood of the vesse . He took leave with characteristic pomp , leaving on board five of his escort , as he said , to see that we carried on no contraband trade . " - Vol. i. p. 211 . After a day or two spent in taking in supplies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be permitted . The activity of Mr. Cleveland , however , discovered that a number of skins could be purchased if taken on board by night ; and the Commandant having , in another pompous visit , ordered the vessel to sail the next day , it was agreed that the boat should be sent for the skins that very night . One boat returned in proper time , with the skins , but the other did not , and at daylight it was found that she had been seized and her crew confined . On discovering this , he writes , " It was now very evident , that not a moment was to be lost in deciding on the course to be pursued . The choice presened us , was that of submission , indignaat treatment , and plunder ; or resistance and hazarding the consequences . There was not the least hesitation with Mr. Shaler or myself , in adopting the latter alternative . As a preliminary step , the guard on board were disarmed , and made to go below ; then I went with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rescue of those as shore . On landing , we ran up to the guard , and , presenting our pistols , ordered them instantly to release our men from their ligatures ; for they had been tied hand and foot , and had been lying on the ground all night . This order was readily complied with by the three soldiers , who had been guarding them ; and , to prevent mischief , we took away their arms , dipped them in the water , and left them on the beach . The mate reported , that they were arrested immediately on landing , by a party of horse , with the Commandant in person at their head ; whence we concluded , that he had sent the soldier , with whom we made the agreement for the skins , expressly to decoy us , that he might have an apology to plunder us. " - Vol. i. p. 214 . There was no course now left for the commanders of the Lelict Byrd , hut to make their escape as soon as possible . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them . Their position was this . The little harbour of San Diego has but one , and that an exceedingly narrow entrance . At the narrowest part of this entrance , on the end of a tongue of land , within a few yards of which every yessel // must pass in going in or out , stands a small fort , in which was a battery of eight brass nine-pounders well mounted and supplied with ball . With a good wind this fort could he passed rapidly and with comparative safety ; but , unfortunately , there was nothing but the last expiring breath of the land breeze . Still , in the attempt there was a chance of success , while , if they remained , ruin to themselves and their adventure would be the inevitable consequence . " While making our preparations , we perceived , that all was bustle and animation on shore ; both horse and foot were flocking to the fort . Our six three-pounders , which were all brought on the side of the ship bearing on the fort , and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resist a battery of six ninepounders and at least an hundred men . As soon as our sails were loosed and we began to heave up the anchor , a gun without shot was discharged from the battery and the Spanish flag hoisted ; perceiving no effect from this , they fired a shot ahead . By this time our anchor was up , all sail was set , and we were gradually approaching the fort . In the hope of preventing their firing , we caused the guard in their uniforms to stand along in the most exposed and conspicuous station ; but it had no effect , not even when so near the fort , that they must have been heard imploring them to desist firing , and seen to fall with their faces to the deck , at every renewed discharge of the cannon . We had been subjected to a cannonade of three quarters of an hour , without returning a shot , and , fortunately , with injury only to our rigging and sails . When arrived abreast the fort , several shot struck our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily stopped by a wad of oakum . We now opened our fire , and , at the first broadside , saw numbers , probably of those who came to see the fun , scampering away up the hill at the back of the fort . Our second broadside seemed to have caused the complete abandonment of their guns , as none were fired afterwards ; nor could we see any person in the fort , excepting a soldier who stood upon the ramparts , waving his hat , as if to desire us to desist firing . " Having passed out of the reach of their cannon , the poor guards , who had been left on board , saw themselves completely in our power , without the chance of rescue , and probably calcu. lated on such treatment as they knew would have been our lot , if equally in the power of their Commandant . Their exhibition of fear was really ludicrous ; for , while we were tying up their fire-arms , so as to prevent their using them , and getting the boat ready to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // tremblingly imploring for mercy ; nor could they be made to believe , until they were actually on shore , that we intended to do them no harm . When landed and their arms handed to them , they embraced each other , crossed themselves , and fell on their knees in prayer . As our boat was leaving them , they rose up and cried , at the utmost stretch of their voices , Vivan , vivan los Americanos. " ' - Vol. i. pp. 215 , 216 . On passing down the coast , Mr. Cleveland found that the story of their exploit had gone before him . A courier had been despatched to various missions along the coast , with an open letter , containing an account of the whole affair , in which , strange to tell , the Commandant was blamed , and a great deal of eulogy expended upon the gallantry of the Americans , and their magnanimity in ceasing their fire and setting the guard ashore unharmed ; so that , in fact , it made the vessel and her crew objects of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure the author , by this opportunity , as we have not the pleasure of his personal acquaintance , that after the lapse of more than thirty years , the story was yet current at San Diego and the neighhouring ports and missions , with some alterations , to be sure , but not less favorable to the Americans . Not only so , hut the battery , with its brass pieces , and its piles of halls , is standing there to this day , as Smith the weaver , would say , " to testify it . ' ' The intercourse of our voyagers with the Padres of the California missions is quite peculiar and interesting . At the mission of San Vicente the Padres of that and the neighbouring missions came down and encamped on the beach opposite the vessel , with a train of Indian domestics , having cooking utensils and provisions , and spent several days of harmonious and pleasant intercourse with the strangers . The week 's provision brought by the Padres having been exhausted , they returned to their missions , promising to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although there was no reason for remaining , yet our adventurers did so , and the Padres , true to their word , appeared and encamped for another week 's recreation . Our author speaks of them as amiable men , but complains of their " being astonished , that men , so humane and intelligent as we , should be blind to the truth and beauty of Catholicism . " This interview of our adventurers with the good old Padre // of San Borgia , is quite touching and primitive in its character , and is , perhaps , the most simply interesting episode in the book . Our readers will readily excuse us for giving it at length . " Steering again to the eastward , we entered a small bay on that part of the coast , which is nearest the mission of San Borgia , and came to anchor . The next day we were visited by the Father of that mission , Mariano Apolonario , who had been expecting us some days , and had kept an Indian on the look-out for us , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice of our approach from the Indian the day before our arrival , he had set out , though uncertain if we had anchored . As his mission was sixty miles from the seacoast , and he was accompanied by twenty domestics , with provisions and bago'acre laden on twenty-five horses and mules , he would have been greatly disappointed had we passed without anchoring , and therefore was gratified at a meeting , which he seemed to have counted much upon . " We made the best arrangement in our power for the accommodation of the Padre and his domestic ; but , after passing one night on board , he experienced such inconvenience from the motion of the ship , as to make it desirable to provide some shelter for him on shore . Accordingly , in the morning a sail was taken on shore , with which our men made a large and commodious tent . Here our days were principally passed in conversation with the Padre , interrupted only by occasional rambles over the sand-hills , for exercise . Amongst the domestics of the Padre , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good cook ; and , as he was provided with plenty of venison and poultry , whereon to exercise his skill , we perceived it to be as much for our advantage , as it was gratifying to the Padre , that we should dine with him every day . On these occasions we had neither plates nor dishes , knives nor forks ; nor were they requisite , as the food was served up in a large wooden bowl , into which each in turn dipped his spoon , in true primitive style . A due degree of exercise in a fine bracing atmosphere , however , previous to taking these homely repasts , gave to them a relish which is not often experienced at the most luxurious and elegant tables . " Perceiving that water was not procurable in this vicinity , having but a short supply on board , and uncertain where it was to be obtained , there was obviously a necessity of cutting short our visit at this station . As soon as the Padre was made acquainted with it , he applied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption of water , although he had to send // six miles for it , and this he did daily until our departure , besides providing abundance of fresh provisions for the ship 's company . " The more intimately we became acquainted with Padre Mariano , the more we were convinced that his was a character to love and respect . He appeared to be one of that rare class , who , for piety and the love of their fellow-men , might justly rank with a Fenelon or a Cheverus . His countenance beaming with the love and benevolence , which were his prevailing motives of action , inspired immediate and perfect confidence , even with those who had seen as much of the Spanish character as it had been our lot to do . His mild and humane treatment of his domestics made their intercourse more like that of father and children , than of master and servants . His regular observance , morning , noon , and evening , of his devotional duties , with his uncouth looking domestics assembled round him , and on bended knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers to the throne of grace , was affecting , and might be received as a tacit reproach for indifference to such duties , by that part of his audience , whom his brethren would denominate heretics . But this good man was gifted with a mind too liberal and noble , and a benevolence too extensive and pure , to pronounce condemnation for difference of opinions , or to believe in the monopoly of truth and goodness in any one sect of Christians . " Our visit here had been protracted much beyond our intentions , by the persuasions of the Padre , and the promise of two horses , which we had unsuccessfully endeavoured to procure at the other missions , as a present to the King of the Sandwich Islands . These arrived at the encampment on the 19th , a male and a female , and were presented to us by the Padre . In return for these , and a flagon of wine and some dried fruits , we gave him such manufactures as he desired , to more than their value . The next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our departure . As it was then late in the afternoon , and we could not consent to deprive the good Padre of his tent for the night , we remained on this account . " Early on the following morning , we went on shore and spent an hour with the Padre , while our men were engaged in striking the tent , and taking away the sail which had formed it . He expressed to us the great satisfaction he had experienced in our society , and regretted we could not pass another week with him , adding that our visit formed an epoch in his life ; that at his mission he lived like a hermit , with no associates , except the rude Indian , and repeated that a visit like ours was a Godsend . ' On taking leave , he assured us , that we should always be remembered in his prayers , and accompanying us to the // boat , repeated and vociferated his * Dios , until we were too distant to hear him more . With our glass , we perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board ; and he did not move off with his retinue until we had weighed anchor . " - Vol. i. pp. 221-2*4 . The Sandwich Islands , and their famous king Tamehameha , * next pass under the author 's notice . " Desirous of conciliating the good opinion of a person Ta . mehameha , whose power was so great , we omitted no attention which we supposed would he agreeable to him . But , whether he had left some duty unperformed on shore , or whether he had met with something to disturb his serenity of mind , we know not ; certain it was , that he did not reciprocate our civilities . Lie appeared to he absent ; and , after walking round the deck of the vessel , and taking only a very careless look of the horses , he got into his canoe , and went on shore . Davis remained on hoard all night to pilot us to the best anchorage , which we gained early the following morning , and , soon after , had our decks crowded with visiters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifference on seeing them , which had been manifested by the King , and which I believe to have been affectation , but , on the contrary , expressed such wonder and admiration , as were very natural on beholding , for the first time , this noble animal . The horses were landed safely , and in perfect health , the sante day , and gave evidence , by their gambols , of their satisfaction at being again on terra firma . They were then presented to the King , who was told , that one had been also left at Owbyhee for him . He expressed his thanks , but did not seem to comprehend their value . " While the crowd were apparently wondering what use they could he put to , a sailor from our ship jumped upon the back of one and galloped off amid the shouts of the natives , who , with alacrity , opened a way to let him pass . There existed strong apprehensions in the minds of all for the safety of the man ; but when , by going hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his subjection and his fleetness , they seemed to form some little conception of his utility . The King was among the number , who witnessed the temerity of the sailor ; but , with all the sagacity for which he has been justly praised , remarked , * The orthography of the author expresses imperfectly the sound of this name , which he has spelled Tamaahmaah . Also , Owhyhee and Otaheite , in the first volume , should be Haweii and Tahiti . The former spelling was owing to a misapprehension of the sounds on the part of the early naviga* tors , which has been corrected by the more careful missionaries . // that he could not perceive that the ability to transport a person from one place to another , in less time than he could run , would be adequate compensation for the food he*would consume and the care he would require .

In this we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King would be influenced by our advice to have them well taken care of ; that they would increase , and eventually that their value would be justly estimated .

From the Sandwich Islands Mr. Cleveland again visited Canton , and sailed thence in the . /Ilert for Boston , where he arrived in May , 1804 , after an absence of about eight years . Here , at the end of the first volume , we shall leave the pleasing task of tracing the fortunes and following the adventures of the author , although they are at this point but half told . We have little fear but that the reader will peruse the remaining half for himself . We can assure him , at all events , that he will find it full of good descriptions , interesting and unexpected events , sudden reverses , manly and indefatigable struggles against misfortune , ending , after forty years of almost unexampled toil and sacrifice of comfort , in , as we ttather from the book , something less than a competency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabot say to him , " You have cut a great deal of hay , but have got it in very badly . " He consoles himself with the reflection of an honest mind , that no one had ever suffered by his misfortunes but himself . After carrying the reader along through this part of our author 's life , we would refer him to the close of the Preface . " The experience of more than twenty years passed in navigating to all parts of the world , has led me to the conclusion , that though the hardships and privations of a seaman 's life be greater than those of any other , there is a compensation in the very excitement of its dangers , in the opportunity it affords of visiting different countries , and viewing mankind in the various gradations between the most barbarous , and the most refined ; and in the ever-changing scenes which this occupation presents . And I can say , with truth , that I not only feel no regret for having chosen this profession rather than any other , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , I should pursue the same course . " - Vol. i. p x . Before taking leave of the author , we will make one or two unconnected extracts from his second volume . // We observe that in his censure of Lord Cochrane , he revives the story of the watchword " Booty and beauty , " given out at New Orleans , and attributes the invention of it to that nobleman . He may not be aware , that a few years ago there appeared a certificate , signed by all the surviving general officers of the English army concerned in that battle , in which they distinctly deny that any such watchword was given out by authority , or was heard of by them at the time ; and say , that they should have publicly contradicted the story long before , had they known that any thing of the kind was in circulation , which they did not , until it came accidentally to their knowledge from one of their number , who immediately called the attention of the others to it . This should at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story with a proviso that it be true . We deem it just to say , that this book is written , throughout , with great fairness and impartiality . Much of it runs over periods when this country was at war or in controversy with England , and Mr. Cleveland had been plundered , as he thinks , by Lord Cochrane and a Colonial Vice-Admiralty court ; yet , whenever he sees any thing worthy of praise in the marine , civil or military , of that country , or in the public conduct of her officers , or the private dealings of her citizens , he is ready and hearty in his commendation . And , although he had been , as he thinks , grossly wronged by Napoleon and the French authorities , and had seen the property of his friends sacrificed by them in a manner which he considered unjust , yet in the same page we find him praising highly the kindness and general urbanity of that people . So , too , although he had suffered under the Spanish rule in South America , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence and civil liberty ; yet when , after some years , he visited that country again , and found it suffering under a misgovernment of its own , he is equally ready to acknowledge the violence and corruption of those of whom he had hoped better things . There is a touch of the satirical in his account of the remarkable attention to religion in Truxillo ; yet he had probably seen there a good deal to provoke distrust , in a priesthood leagued in with the civil power , and used as a support for indolent men of family , whom Spanish blood would not permit to labor . " If I was struck with the attention given to the affairs of re // ligion at Lima , much more was this the case at Truxillo ; for this as much surpasses the other in private , as well as public devotional observances , as the former appeared to me to exceed every other place I had ever before visited . Indeed , the priests may truly be said to live in clover at Truxillo ; the whole business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very properly be viewed as a great cloister . It often occurs , that many of the class called merchants , and probably others , are invisible at the ordinary hours of business ; and on inquiry as to the cause , it appears that they are at their devotions , in which they must not be disturbed . Some families are said to spend eight hours of the day in prayer . All this show of sanctity would be very laudable , if it made them better , or more honest men ; but it had a tendency to put me more on my guard . " - Vol. ii . pp. 179 , 180 . He is ready to acknowledge , that the regular devotions of the unaffectedly pious Padre of San Borgia were " a tacit reproach for indifference to such duties on the part of his auditors . " We wish there were more of this candid spirit among our maritime writers and adventurers . Whatever may be our opinion of the distinguishing doctrines of the Romish church , we should certainly not scoff when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon . We agree with him , that it is a reproach and mortification to us , that so many of those engaged in spreading our commerce in foreign countries , practical infidels in their lives , without any religious observances , with nothing but their flag and ship 's papers to show that they come from a country which is a part of Christendom , and who are only Protestants in that they are not Romanists , should put to shame one branch of the Christian church , and obscure our claim to be called a Christian people , in the eyes of the pious of other countries . The description of the state of things on board the British frigate . flndrornache , must he gratifying to all admirers of the naval service in any country . " As the Andromaclie , English frigate , was on the point of sailing for that port , I succeeded with her commander in obtaining a passage ; and having procured a passport from the Viceroy , I embarked , and sailed on the morning of the 3d of August . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , made a strong impression on my mind , from an exhibition of discipline which I had never before seen . When the marines were dismissed after the morning parade , the colors hoisted , and // the national air , God save the King , ' played , every officer and man being at his station , and the capstern manned , a signal was made by the captain , to heave ahead ; the cable came in briskly ; the anchor was soon tript , and up ready for hooking the cat . While the ship was swinging round , the men , who had been stationed for the purpose at the shrouds of each mast , on a signal given , ran up simultaneously to cast loose the sails , while the requisite number were stationed below , to sheet borne , and hoist up ; so that almost in a moment , the ship was under a crowd of sail , and swiftly leaving the port ; and all this effected without a word being spoken , and as if by the effect of magic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-four days . I can not allow the pleasant time I spent on board this frigate to pass without some notice , and without acknowledging the erroneous impressions I had imbibed , of a British ship of war . In common with many others , and especially those , like myself , whose reminiscences were of a date as remote as our revolutionary war , I had imagined an English man-of-war to be a small epitome of hell , where tyrannizing over the crew constituted the principal enjoyment of the officers . That there were great abuses of this kind in the navy , from a very early period , up to the alarming revolt under President Parker , I have no doubt , any more than I have that abuses have occasionally existed since ; but , on board the Andromache , there was never any unnecessnry severity . " Captain Sheriffe , having had the advantage of moving in the most elevated and polished society at home , and of receiving his professional education from one of the most able commanders in the British navy , united the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skilful and accomplished commander . His indefatigable perseverance in attending to the protection of the commercial interests of his country , and his judicious conduct in his intercourse with the governments of Chili and Peru in the most trying times , were no less evidence of his superior abilities , than of the wisdom and discrimination of those who appointed him . Nor did these important duties interfere with those of his ship 's company , to whose morals , manners , cleanliness , and comfort he was attentive , at the same time granting them so many innocent indulgences , that they certainly constituted the happiest ship 's company I had ever seen . " With such a commander , the officers could not fail to be gentlemanly in their deportment , and attentive to their duty ; but , independently of such example , there was evidently an innate desire among them to second the views of their worthy // commander ; and , messing with them , I had good opportunity of witnessing a degree of amiability , harmony , and good fellowship , which , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of their kind attention to me , and desire to make me comfortable , I shall always retain a grateful recollection . " With Captain Sheriffe , the passengers , of whom there were four heside myself ; were invited to dine in rotation , and my turn was , generally , two or three times a week . An excellent hand , of about twenty performers , always played during dinner ; invariably beginning with God save the King , ' and ending with Rule Britannia . ' After dinner , the men were usually exercised at the great guns ; and , if the weather was ever so fine , the topsails were always reefed before sunset . Sparring , fencing , and dancing , were the amusements of the midshipmen , in which the Captain would frequently join . " The seamen , also , had their hours of relaxation , music , and dancing , once or twice a week . Sunday never failed to be duly hallowed . Soon after hreakfast , every officer appeared on the quarter-deck in his uniform ; the marines were dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared with benches , and a temporary pulpit , at a signal given ( usually about ten o'clock ) every one attended worship , which was performed with as much solemnity and decency , as I ever witnessed in any church . The chaplain never failed to give a plain , good , moral lesson , perfectly adapted to the understandings of his audience ; and such as they could not fail to profit by . The music , from the full hand , was delightful ; and when they played , as they often did , the Portuguese and Pleyel 's Hymns , which were familiar to me , they called up associations of by-gone and happier days . " - Vol. ii . pp. 133 - 136 . The high integrity shown by a British commercial house , he also acknowledges in a manner which must be as gratifying to them , as the mention of it will be to the reader .

Its object was to inform me of their holding a hundred and twenty pounds at my disposal , being principal and interest on a sum arising from a mistake accidentally discovered , in accounts relative to transactions in wheat eight or ten years previous ; and which , they remark , I must consider somewhat in the light of a prize in the lottery . This was paid to my draft at sight . " - Vol. ii . p. 222. // 192 July , Before parting with the author , we would call his attention , and that of the reader , to a single sentence in the Preface . After speaking of the great improvement in the moral and social condition of the Sandwich Islands , he remarks , that it furnishes " a most remarkable instance of the ameliorating and humanizing effects of commerce . " We are inclined to think , that the word commerce was rather a chance termination to a sentence , than the expression of a well-considered opinion . The truth is , the present condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian missions , and of the preaching of the Gospel , to counteract the evil effects of commerce . This ground has been gone over so often , and the position we take is so well established , that we were rather surprised to see this opinion , if such it be , of Mr. Cleveland ; yet , lest it should have an effect on the minds of some readers not well informed on the subject , we will give , in a few words , what we are quite certain can be proved by authentic and easily accessible evidence , to be the true state of the case . When the Sandwich Islands were discovered by Cook in 1778 , the inhabitants were idolaters , sacrificing human victims to their gods . No form of religion is without its system of restraints ; and such was the tabu system of the Sandwich Islanders . This consisted of numerous prohibitions , and the injunction of many observances arbitrary and grievous to be borne ; any infringement of which was punishable by death , and , in some cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods . Occasional tabus also prohibited certain kinds of food , and certain pleasures and indulgences , during specified periods of time . It is said , that American merchants resided in the Islands in 1786 , six years before Vancouver 's visit , and a pretty intimate acquaintance with commerce , on the part of the natives , must be dated back early in the beginning of the nineteenth century . Tamehameha , their remarkable monarch , died in the spring of 1819 ; yet , though commerce had had free course with the natives for thirty years , idolatry still reigned ; and after his death , the horrid scenes usual at such times were enacted . In the autumn of 1819 , the idolatry and tabu system , which were one and the same , were abolished . The causes which led to this were unquestionably the following . In the first // place , the natives saw the superiority of the foreigners , and knew that they worshipped no idols , and violated all the rules of the tabu with impunity . This both tended to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of their gods to punish any infringements of it . Moreover , the tabu bore particularly hard upon the women , who were never allowed to eat with men , and sometimes prohihited from using the choicest food ; and many of the principal chiefs at the time were women , and the government was , in fact , in the hands of the king 's mother . Also , the tabu had been abolished and idolatry overthrown in the islands of the South Pacific , under the influence of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society , and this was well known and much talked of at the Sandwich Islands . Moreover , many of their young men , some of them sons of chiefs , had been receiving a Christian education in America , under the patronage of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions . Ardent spirits had also been introduced , and under their influence , the strictest rules of the tabu were frequently broken , and its sacredness was fast vanishing , before the practice of both foreigners and natives . At the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor people were literally without religion . No Gospel had been preached to them , and they had only substituted complete atheism and unbounded license to do evil in the place of their old idolatries . Ardent spirits of the worst kind , literally liquid fire , were arriving in every vessel from Christendom ; and unrestricted use was made of them by the natives , encouraged by the white traders and the example of the seamen . Licentiousness had no bounds , and a disease , unknown before to the Islands , introduced by the bearers of commerce , was spreading with fearful rapidity among the people . These two causes threatened to destroy the moral and physical force of the natives , and in the course of time to sweep them entirely away . In five months after the abolition of idolatry , the first Christian missionaries landed on the islands ; being sent out by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions . At the time of their arrival , the people were no better as to their social or moral condition than they had been but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years ; yet no Gospel had been preached , // no alphabet of their language had been made , or attempted ; not a native could read English ; their old social corruptions remained ; and new and more dangerous ones were daily introduced . The resident foreign traders , and the masters of vessels in the habit of visiting the Islands , opposed violently the first settlement of the missionaries . The young king , who was dissolute and intemperate , inclined to the side of the traders , but was overruled by his mother , who favored the missionaries from the first ; and they were permitted to remain . These missionaries , and the others , who from time to time came to their aid , commenced , and have to this day steadily carried forward , a work , which may be divided into three parts . First , the preaching of the Gospel , with its consequences of moral sanctions and prohibitions . Secondly , their literary labors ; that is , the forming of an alphabet , and subsequently a grammar and dictionary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most useful and popular books of our own tongue ; under this head , also , maybe arranged their extended and most successful system of teaching the natives in schools , and by private instruction . The last division of their work , and for the most part , a result of tl ) e two former , is the improvement of the social condition of the natives . Under the direction of the missionaries , assisted by the society and its friends at home , implements of husbandry , manufactures , and mechanical labor have been introduced , and the natives taught and encouraged in the useful arts and trades . They have been taught the value of coins and of articles of commerce , and encouraged to engage in trade . Polygamy , intemperance , and licentiousness have been checked , and an improving social and political condition is manifest among them . The missionaries have also carried on these three branches of the benevolent operations simultaneously , and are not subject to the charge of giving undue attention to any one of them , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threefold work may be stated in a few words , and present a surprising whole . In May , 1840 , twenty years after the first missionaries landed at the Islands , there were in the whole group , nineteen native Christian churches , numbering 18,450 communicants in good standing . Upwards of 800 natives have died , in full communion and profession of faith . There are nearly // 6000 baptized children in the Islands , and , during the year 1840 , there were 1200 Christian marriages , and 1700 baptisms . There are about 200 common schools , with 14,000 scholars , of whom 10,000 are able to read . Besides these common schools , there is a seminary for the education of native preachers , and a large number of boarding schools , both for boys and girls . These schools all owe their institution to the missionaries , and are taught either by the missionaries , or by persons educated under their care . Printing in the llaweiian language is extensively done . It was begun by the missionaries , and is still carried on under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 1840 there were printed and bound in that language , upwards of 100,000 copies of books , treating upon all subjects ; arithmetic , geography , general knowledge and science , the general laws and local regulations of the government , as well as the Scriptures , and works more strictly theological. * The plough has been introduced among the natives , and latterly the sugarcane and cotton have been planted , in addition to the other foreign products , which they had been previously taught to cultivate . Several stone meetinghouses have been built by the natives , and good houses are common . Roads and bridges are fast improving . A constitution and a complete code of laws are preparing , under the superintendence of an American gentleman , who was formerly a missionary , but resigned his office , in order that the mission might be disconnected entirely from the civil power . The books necessary for the compiling of this code were presented by the American Board . To bring these facts to bear upon the point to which we called the author 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this is to be attributed to the missionaries , who were sent out by the Christians of other lands , for the sole purpose of preaching the Gospel , and introducing the morals , arts , and cultivation that follow in its train . Nor is this all . It has been done , not only without the aid , but in spite of the resistance , of commerce . Here we will ask attention to a few more facts , condensed as much as possible . * The natives have now in their own language , printed and bound at the Islands , two compendiums of Geography , ( Woodbridge 's , and that which hears the name of Malte-Brun ) ; works on arithmetic , algebra , geometry , navigation , and surveying ; books of music ; and a newspaper . // First ; it has been done without the assistance of ' commerce . ( By commerce , here , we mean , of course , the influence of those engaged in commerce , and of the articles of trade introduced by it . There have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among resident and transient traders ; but they have stood alone , have been classed with the missionaries , and have generally been persons who went to the Islands for the purpose of rendering aid and countenance to them , as traders and citizens . With this explanation and exception , we will proceed . ) Commerce never made a letter of the native language , nor established any system of ' teaching , or publishing books . The missionaries caught every human sound that floated in the atmosphere , and gave it a sign ; made these signs into an alphabet ; made grammars and dictionaries ; introduced schools ; labored in teaching ; and printed the Scriptures , and books of general information and science . Commerce preached no Gospel , and established no church . The missionaries had that field , undisputed , to themselves . Commerce did little or nothing to improve the social condition of the natives , or to instruct them in the trades , arts , or labors of civilized life . Whatever of these things the whites had or knew , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture , science , and the mechanic arts . Commerce gave them no laws . The missionaries instructed their chiefs in legal science , and assisted them in forming a constitution and a criminal and civil code . Secondly ; the great work , some parts of which we have detailed , has been carried on against the opposition of commerce . Here we have a graver subject and a more disagreeable picture to present . The foreign traders , resident and transient , opposed the first settlement of the missionaries , and they were permitted to remain by the native authorities against this opposition . Commerce brought ardent spirits , and all other deadly articles of traffic , and these formed the chief trade with the natives . The missionaries preached temperance , and under the gospel-influence some laws were enacted against selling or drinking ardent spirits , and for many years the Sandwich Islands presented the interesting spectacle of a half-civilized people struggling to maintain temperance and good order against the efforts of foreign residents among them , and the example of masters and seamen of vessels // coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy of temperance and the entire exclusion of ardent spirit , was from the open opposition and secret enticements of the foreign traders , resident and transient , - from commerce and her carriers . Notwithstanding that the laws prohibited even the importation of ardent spirits , cargoes after cargoes of it were sent from America to he smuggled into the country , or to be landed in open defiance of the laws , and sold in the grog-shops and eating-houses kept solely by whites . The missionaries preached chastity , and under the influence of the Gospel , laws were made against licentiousness , and especially the intercourse of women with the shipping , before that time universally carried on . These laws were vehemently and violently opposed by the emissaries of commerce . They had heretofore enjoyed entire license in this respect , and masters and traders , transiently visiting the Islands , came with their evil inclinations inflamed by the representations of former visiters , and were indignant at their disappointment . In one instance a ship 's company came ashore , demanding liquor and women . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening violence ; and soon afterwards landed again to execute it . The natives sent their women into the mountains for protection , and after searching the town with fearful oaths and horrible language , the sailors attacked the house of the missionary . The wife of the missionary would not leave her post , and the house was defended by the natives , armed with muskets and lances . Being repulsed , the seamen went on board , and the ship cannonaded the house for some time . One of the balls is now in the keeping of the Missionary Society . Several scenes like this occurred at different places , in one of which a naval officer of the United States was concerned . Evidence of this is now in the national archives at Washington . As this officer was disgraced sufficiently at the time , and has felt the effects of his conduct in his profession , we will not mention his name . Matters came to such a state , that the United States government despatched the sloop-of-war Vincennes , with a letter to the King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affrays , and declaring them deserving of punishment under the laws of their own country . The stand taken by Captain Finch , of the Vincennes , and the exampie // set by him , added to the letter of the President , checked and humbled the violence of the rioters . At the same time the American Board published the names of the traders and masters of vessels engaged in the riots and breach of the laws , and also of the merchants in America , who persisted in sending into that country the prohibited cargoes . This completed the triumph of the efforts of the natives after good order and morals ; and in a few years the Sandwich Islands were perhaps the most temperate colony on the globe . Our readers are aware , that the French government has forced upon the Sandwich Islanders , at the cannon 's mouth , a treaty , which allows the importation and sale of French brandies. * This clause , we are informed , was introduced at the suggestion of French commercial residents and visiters ; and the French consul is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to be seen whether the temperance of the poor Islanders will survive this shock ; and we leave it to persons more fond of statistics than ourselves , to compute the gallons of brandy that will be imported into the Islands , under that clause , by our own merchants of Boston , New York , and Baltimore . It is well known , that the combined influence of ardent spirits introduced by commerce , and of that dreadful disease brought in by her emissaries , is now fast sweeping off the native population . In some districts where the influence of the Gospel has predominated , this depopulation has been arrested . Thus much is certain . If the native population is swept away , it will be owing to the intemperance and diseases brought in by commerce . If the depopulation is checked , it will be by the happy effects of the labors of Christian missionaries , in counteracting the evil effects of commerce . Such has been the comparative history of commerce and of Christian missions at the Sandwich Islands . Yet , though commerce has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy to commerce . Under the better state of things at the Islands , brought about by the Gospel , a nobler commerce has sprung up . The influence of law and order , and of public opinion both there and at home , has been felt , and a chastened and subdued commerce is now the best ally of Christianity . Public opinion is setting // strongly in favor of the missions and the native laws ; and the testimony of naval commanders , both of England and America , and of their whole corps of officers and of other unprejudiced visiters , constantly and voluntarily given , to their advantage , * has been instrumental in changing that current which had before been directed by those interested in the commerce of the Islands , and who had the public ear almost exclusively to themselves . We wish our limits would allow us to lay before the reader an outline of the history of commerce in other barbarous and half-civilized regions . But we must forbear . If his attention is awakened in this matter , he will allow us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , and to the Report of the select committee of the House of Commons , appointed February , 1836 , " to consider what measures ought to be adopted with regard to the native inhabitants of countries where British settlements are made , in order to secure to them the due observance of justice , and the protection of their rights ; to promote the spread of civilization among them , and to lead them to the peaceful and voluntary reception of the Christian religion . " These works , and others of undoubted authority , will disclose , with here and there exceptions , a course of violence , corruption , and fraud , in the dealings and conduct of the emissaries of commerce , in Africa , India , Sumatra , the islands of the North and South Pacific , and the Northwest Coast of America , which will be almost incredible to the reader . Thus much they seem to establish conclusively ; that the notion of commerce and civilization first , and the Gospel afterwards , is fallacious ; that the Gospel saves the natives from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against those of their visiters ; and that the early and immediate intervention and encouragement of teachers of the Gospel , is essential to the salvation , temporal as well as spiritual , of these poor people , for whom the whites must render a strict account ; and that the injunction , " Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all other things shall be added unto you , " is not yet overruled . Where missionaries are , commerce may be carried on peacefully and safely ; where the Gospel has never been , * See Letters of Captain Jones , of the Peacock ; of Captain Gambier , R. N. ; and of the officers of our Exploring Expedition . // commerce is synonymous with vice and bloodshed . Missionaries have resided safely , where no flag would have protected the merchant or sailor ; and many a mariner , coasting along a newly discovered island , doubting if he may enter in peace , or at all , - let him but catch a glimpse of the neat cottage and garden plat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he shall meet with a peaceful , honest , and well-ordered people . We owe an apology to the reader and to our author for this long digression . We have made it hoping it might do good , and because we feel bound on every occasion to protest against a notion so often advanced by the unthinking or the ill-disposed . We repeat , that we do not think the author would disparage the efforts of Christian missionaries , or that he intended to do so in this instance ; for his kindness of heart , and the moral tone of his feelings , as expressed in this book , will not fail to strike the reader forcibly . In conclusion , he will allow us to express our sympathy in his various fortunes ; our admiration of his perseverance , enterprise , and courage ; our best wishes for the success of his excellent book ; and our hope , that he may find much comfort , to use his own words , in the " remaining years , or months , or days , may they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
