WEST <p> San Francisco <p> ( 13-3 , first ) <p> THE GOOD : This is the NFL 's model franchise with superstars in all the key positions : owner , general manager , coach , quarterback , wide receiver , tight end , defensive tackle , linebacker , cornerback , safety , trainer , equipment manager . <p> THE BAD : OK , maybe losing running back Ricky Watters was bad , but with William Floyd still back there , how bad can that be ? <p> THE UGLY : Have you seen their new world championship rings ? All those bulky trophies and all those diamonds crowded onto one setting ? <p> PREDICTION : First again , but with a little more competition from within the division . <p> New Orleans <p> ( 7-9 , tied for second ) <p> THE GOOD : If Timm Rosenbach can re-establish himself as successfully as Jim Everett did , the Saints may have the strongest one-two quarterback punch in the league this year . The Saints also have a terrific one-two punch at wide receiver with Michael Haynes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football in Willie Roaf . And if Eric Allen and Rufus Porter have anything left , the Saints will have made a major improvement in their defense . <p> THE BAD : A conservative offensive scheme designed to keep the Saints in the game that , unfortunately , also keeps the other team in the game . <p> THE UGLY : A declining fan base that has grown tired of hanging around the fringes with Jim Mora . <p> PREDICTION : Second . No threat to Niners . <p> Atlanta <p> ( 7-9 , tied for second ) <p> THE GOOD : June Jones has done a nice job of reclaiming Jeff George and a magnificent job of replacing wide receivers Michael Haynes , Mike Pritchard and Andre Rison with Terance Mathis , Bert Emanuel , J.J. Birdin and Eric Metcalf . <p> THE BAD : Jones has failed to do much in the way of putting some teeth in his defense , and that includes the questionable acquisition of aging linebacker Darryl Talley . <p> THE UGLY : Any linebacking corps in which Talley , 35 , and Clay Matthews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they can win seven games again . <p> Carolina <p> ( Expansion team ) <p> THE GOOD : With some strong moves in free agency and some good picks in the draft , the Panthers already have a better roster than a number of teams in the NFL , including Washington , Cincinnati , Tampa Bay and St. Louis . Kerry Collins behind Frank Reich is good planning , while Barry Foster and Mark Carrier give the offense instant credibility . Defensively , the Panthers may have the best lineup of linebackers in the league in free agents Lamar Lathon , Sam Mills , Carlton Bailey and Darion Conner . With two games each against the Rams , the Saints and the Falcons , it 's easy to see why Bill Walsh would predict a six-win season for the Panthers . <p> THE BAD : Ca n't really think of anything all that bad . <p> THE UGLY : Those three-hour drives to Clemson every other Sunday . <p> PREDICTION : Fourth with something more than six wins . <p> St. Louis <p> ( 4-12 , fourth ) <p> THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was this one . So it may well be that changing towns and coaches was the best thing that could have happened to the Rams . <p> THE BAD : A roster that counts only veteran runner Jerome Bettis and rookie pass-rusher Kevin Carter as potential superstars . <p> THE UGLY : Hiring Rich Brooks out of the college ranks was an act of desperation . <p> PREDICTION : Last again , but this time as the fifth-place team . <p> CENTRAL <p> Minnesota <p> ( 10-6 , first ) <p> THE GOOD : This is the one team in the division that found a way to rise above 9-7 last season . It also is the one team that has Warren Moon at quarterback and the one team that has two big-time wide receivers in Cris Carter and Jake Reed , and the one team that has Tony Dungy as its defensive coordinator . <p> THE BAD : Losing defensive ace Henry Thomas is going to hurt , and the Vikings still have n't replaced running back Terry Allen . <p> THE UGLY : An off-season in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social misconduct . <p> PREDICTION : First again , if Moon manages to maintain his poise . <p> Chicago <p> ( 9-7 , tied for second ) <p> THE GOOD : The Bears have a long and proud history of producing great coaches and great running backs . They 've already got a good start on Dave Wannstedt , and all indications are that Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam will not disappoint . The Bears also may have the NFL 's softest schedule . <p> THE BAD : As a wise old coach once said : " If you have two quarterbacks , you have no quarterback . " In Steve Walsh and Erik Kramer , Wannstedt has his worst predicament . <p> THE UGLY : A run defense that was 24th in the league playing in the same division with Barry Sanders . <p> PREDICTION : Second again , but with 10 wins . <p> Detroit <p> ( 9-7 , tied for second ) <p> THE GOOD : Running back Barry Sanders is simply the best , wide receiver Herman Moore is one of the best and quarterback Scott Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks a lot better with the addition of Henry Thomas and rookie sensation Luther Elliss of Mancos . <p> THE BAD : Question : Why does this team start every season groping to find an offense ? Answer : It must be lousy coaching . <p> THE UGLY : What 's going to happen to Wayne Fontes if the Lions do n't show up at the end of the season with another disappointing 9-7 record . <p> PREDICTION : Third at 9-7 . <p> Green Bay <p> ( 9-7 , tied for second ) <p> THE GOOD : Having Brett Favre on offense and Reggie White on defense gives the Packers a large measure of security on every snap of the game . The steady hand of Mike Holmgren is also a positive factor . <p> THE BAD : Adding a couple of reluctant receivers in Keith Jackson and Mark Ingram does not make up for losing Sterling Sharpe . Losing Bryce Paup on defense also hurts . <p> THE UGLY : A draft history that includes Tony Mandarich , Brent Fullwood , Darrell Thompson and Terrell Buckley . <p> PREDICTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( 6-10 , fifth ) <p> THE GOOD : Despite their 20-year history of losing , the Bucs were sold for a record $ 192 million to Florida financier Malcolm Glazer during the off-season . The Bucs also went out and bought a big-time receiver in Alvin Harper . And they also may have gotten the steal of the draft in Warren Sapp . <p> THE BAD : The Bucs got rid of their best player , quarterback Craig Erickson . <p> PREDICTION : A more interesting fifth . <p> EAST <p> Dallas <p> ( 12-4 , first ) <p> THE GOOD : Troy Aikman is either the best or second-best quarterback in the league , depending on the last NFC Championship game . In Michael Irvin , Emmitt Smith , Jay Novacek and Erik Williams , he also has either the best or second-best supporting cast , depending On defense , all the numbers say Dallas is best . <p> THE BAD : Losing Alvin Harper , Mark Stepnoski and Jim Jeffcoat only can further weaken a roster that has taken more than its share of free-agent hits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get when owner Jerry Jones has to explain all those Aikman commercials for Coke to his $ 40 million buddies at Pepsi . <p> PREDICTION : First of the firsts . <p> New York Giants <p> ( 9-7 , second ) <p> THE GOOD : In the Dan Reeves formula for winning , the idea is to control the game with your running attack and to win it with your passing attack . So will everybody stop asking what he plans to do with Rodney Hampton , Herschel Walker and Tyrone Wheatley all on the same roster . Also good was the idea of hiring Steve DeBerg to coach Dave Brown . <p> THE BAD : A rebuilt offensive line working in front of a struggling young quarterback . <p> THE UGLY : Having to play Dallas twice with mediocre talent on defense . <p> PREDICTION : Second at 9-7 . <p> Arizona <p> ( 8-8 , third ) <p> THE GOOD : In Dave Krieg , the Cardinals finally may have a quarterback who wo n't be intimidated by Buddy Ryan . They also have a quarterback who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the playoffs in ' 94 . Rob Moore should be of some help . And the defense is n't bad . <p> THE BAD : In Buddy Ryan , the Cards have the most disruptive , most counter-productive coach in the NFL . They also have a coach who has n't won a playoff game in three tries . <p> THE UGLY : The honeymoon with Ryan is over in Arizona . Another disappointing 8-8 season and divorce proceedings will begin . <p> PREDICTION : Third at 9-7 . <p> Philadelphia <p> ( 7-9 , fourth ) <p> THE GOOD : Randall Cunningham is still one of the most talented quarterbacks in the league , Ricky Watters is one of the most talented running backs in the league , Fred Barnett and Calvin Williams are two of the best wide receivers in the league and new coach Ray Rhodes is one of the best defensive coaches in the league . <p> THE BAD : A defense that loses its best player every year , this time Eric Allen . <p> THE UGLY : An owner short in the pockets who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fourth . <p> Washington <p> ( 3-13 , fifth ) <p> THE GOOD : Thanks to free agency , the Redskins suddenly may have the best safety tandem in football right now in Stanley Richard and James Washington . Thanks to the draft , they also have a new big-time receiver in Michael Westbrook . And someday , quarterback Heath Shuler is going to be a star . <p> THE BAD : A running game that has gone sour . <p> THE UGLY : What 's going to happen to Norv Turner if he does n't produce a winning record as predicted by owner Jack Kent Cooke for a second straight season . <p> PREDICTION : Last again , with better numbers .
