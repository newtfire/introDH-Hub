| to say that a table goes out of existence when it is painted violates the principle of prolongation which ( 2 ) expresses , insofar as the table 's career , which is traced under the sortal " table , " can be further prolonged under that sortal . It might now be suggested that the difference between the case of painting a table , where nothing goes out of existence , and the case of smashing it to pieces , where the table does go out of existence , is that in the former case we can continuously prolong the career of the brown table by shifting from the sortal " brown table " to the sortal " green table , " whereas in the latter case we simply lose the ability to prolong continuously the path we are tracing , no matter how we might try to shift sortals . That we can not in any manner continuously prolong the path of the table after it is smashed to pieces does seem a rather plausible assessment , especially if we adopt my suggestion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate sense . The principle of prolongation , as defined earlier , required that a career which is traced under a sortal F should not be terminated when it can be continuously prolonged under F. The present suggestion is that the principle be strengthened to require that a career which is traced under a sortal F should not be terminated when it can be continuously prolonged under any other sortal . The rule for terminating a career would then be ( 3 ) Where F is a sortal and S is a continuous succession of Fstages , the beginning and end of S correspond respectively to the coming into existence and going out of existence of an F-thing if and only if S is not the segment of a longer continuous succession of object-stages ( where these objectstages may come under various sortals ) . ( 3 ) gets considerably closer to the truth than either ( i ) or ( 2 ) , and does perhaps accommodate the majority of typical cases in which we distinguish between an object persisting through change and an object going out of ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still not correct . Whereas ( i ) and ( 2 ) were wrong in ignoring , or not giving sufficient scope to , the principle of prolongation , ( 3 ) goes wrong in exaggerating this principle . It is not true , as ( 3 ) implies , that we are always permitted to prolong an object 's career by shifting to a sortal other than the one  | under which we were tracing . Sometimes this is so but sometimes it is not . The sorts of cases that need to be taken into account are those that were mentioned in the last chapter to show that an object can sometimes go out of existence only to be continuously replaced by another object . When a car is subjected to the crushing machine it goes out of existence and is replaced by a block of scrap metal . ( 3 ) would imply , however , that the car 's career ought to be prolonged by shifting from the sortal " car " to the sortal " block of scrap metal . " There may in fact be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out of existence just because it turns into a block of scrap metal , and one important possible source of this resistance will emerge in the next chapter . When we soberly reflect upon this case , however , and keep in mind that we are talking- about the car and not about the material components that make it up , it becomes sufficiently clear , I think , that the car does go out of existence ( though the material components that make it up may of course persist ) . If you predict " That car will never be touched by Miriam " then you can presumably make this prediction come true by immediately putting the car into the crushing machine . It will not matter if Miriam later touches the block of scrap metal that comes out of the machine because she would not be touching the car that you referred to . What is evidently required , and what ( 3 ) does not accomplish , is to explicate the rule on the basis of which it is legitimate to prolong the career of a brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where it is not legitimate to prolong the career of a car by shifting to the sortal " block of scrap metal . " We want to understand the conceptual difference between the legitimate shift from " brown table " to " green table " and the illegitimate shift from " car " to " block of scrap metal . " When our question is put in these terms the correct answer fairly leaps to the eye . There is after all a very obvious and special relationship between " brown table " and " green table " that does not obtain between " car " and " block of scrap metal . " The former pair of sortals , but not the latter , are qualifications or restrictions of a common sortal . " Brown table " and " green table " are , as I will say , subordinate to " table . " To say that the term F is subordinate to the term G means that F 's being truly predicable of an object analytically entails G 's being truly predicable of it .  | ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term is subordinate to itself . ) The rule which has now emerged is that when an object 's career is traced under the sortal F its career is to be prolonged by shifting to the sortal F ' just in case F and F ' are both subordinate to some common sortal G. Thus : The Sortal Rule Addendum . Where F is a sortal and S is a continuous succession of F-stages , the beginning and end of S correspond respectively to the coming into existence and going out of existence of an F-thing if and only if S is not the segment of a longer continuous succession of G-stages , for any sortal G to which F is subordinate . The sortal rule addendum properly explicates the principle of prolongation which was already implicit in the original sortal rule . The basic idea here is really quite simple . Any object 's career , from the moment of its coming into existence to the moment of its going out of existence , must correspond to a continuous succession of F-stages , where F is some highly general sortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tree . " In the course of its career , however , the object will pass through various transitory phases that are marked off by such less general sortals as " brown table , " " car in a garage , " or " tree with snow on it . " The gaining and losing of these less general sortals do not affect the continuance of the object 's career so long as its career remains traceable under the more general sortal . The object goes out of existence , however , when its career can no longer be prolonged under the general sortal . It will be noted that insofar as spatial continuity is regarded as an ingredient of spatiotemporal continuity the sortal rule addendum implies that an object can never persist in a spatially discontinuous form ( though , again , the rule allows for the possibility that an object which goes out of existence because of fragmentation may later come back into existence when its parts are reassembled ) . As such the rule seems to provide one reasonable , and especially simple , way of describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A possible alternative , however , would be to suppose that there are circumstances in which an ordinary object like a table might be said to persist in a spatially discontinuous form ( perhaps , for example , where the table is only momentarily dismantled and  | then immediately reassembled ) . Presumably this supposition would imply that the table might persist as a table in a spatially discontinuous form . The idea , generally , would be that , for some sortals F , there are special circumstances in which it is proper to speak of there existing a spatially discontinuous F-thing . If this alternative is favored all that is required is that for the purposes of the sortal rule and addendum spatial continuity not be regarded as an ingredient of spatiotemporal continuity . The rule would then imply that the career of a table be prolonged so long as we can trace a temporally and qualitatively continuous succession S of ( perhaps spatially discontinuous ) table-stages such that the ( perhaps spatially discontinuous ) places which coincide with temporally neighboring stages in S overlap appropriately . Wiggins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , between what he calls " substance sortals " and " phase ( or restricted ) sortals. " 4 This distinction , along the general lines that he explains it , might be defined as follows : " F is a substance sortal " means : F is a sortal , and it is a conceptual truth that if S is a continuous succession of F-stages , and S is not a segment of a longer continuous succession of F-stages , then the beginning and end of S correspond respectively to the coming into existence and going out of existence of an F-thing . " F is a phase sortal " means : F is a sortal and F is not a substance sortal . A highly general sortal like " table " seems to qualify as a substance sortal on this definition because , as we said before , it seems to be a conceptual truth that the terminal points of a longest continuous succession of table-stages correspond to the coming into existence and going out of existence of a table . A less general sortal like " brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a conceptual truth that the terminal points of a longest continuous succession of brown table-stages correspond to the coming into existence and going out of existence of a brown table . Phase sortals will typically be complex expressions constructed from a substance sortal and a qualifying adjectival expression . Hence " brown table , " " car in the garage , " and " tree with snow on it . " 4 . Wiggins , Identity and Spatio-Temporal Continuity , pp. 7 , 29-30.  | There are , however , some clearcut examples of syntactically simple phase sortals . One example is " kitten . " It is clearly not a conceptual truth that a kitten goes out of existence whenever a continuous succession of kitten-stages terminates . This is because " kitten " ( roughly , " young cat " ) is subordinate to " cat , " so the principle of prolongation expressed by the addendum requires us to prolong the kitten 's career by shifting from " kitten " to " ( older ) cat . " It is easy to see that if F is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sortal then F must be a substance sortal . The sortal rule addendum says in effect that the terminal points of a longest continuous F-succession ( i.e. , a continuous succession of F-stages that is not a segment of a longer continuous succession of F-stages ) correspond to the coming into existence and going out of existence of an F-thing unless the F-succession is a segment of a longer continuous G-succession , for some sortal G to which F is subordinate . But if F is not subordinate to any other sortal then there can be no such sortal G. Hence the terminal points of a longest continuous F-succession must correspond to the coming into existence and going out of existence of an F-thing , which qualifies F as a substance sortal . Someone might want to argue for the converse principle as well , viz , if F is a substance sortal then F can not be subordinate to any other sortal . Instead of displaying this argument in general terms I will illustrate it for the case of " dog " and " animal . " Assume that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is subordinate to " animal . " It might then be argued as follows that " animal " can not be a sortal . We can conceive of a continuous succession S of animal-stages such that an initial segment of S contains dog-stages and a later segment of S contains nondog-stages . S might correspond , for example , to the imaginable situation of a dog gradually changing into a cat . Since " dog " is assumed to be a substance sortal we would have to say that the end point of the segment of dog-stages in S corresponds to a dog going out of existence ( i.e. , that the dog goes out of existence when it turns into the cat ) . Since necessarily any dog is an animal ( " dog " being assumed subordinate to " animal " ) whenever a dog goes out of existence an animal must go out of existence . We would then be saying that it is possible for there to be a continuous succession S of animal-stages which contains a segment the end point of  | which corresponds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would be saying , in other words , that it is possible for there to be a situation in which one animal went out of existence and was continuously replaced by another animal . ) But if " animal " were a sortal the principle of prolongation expressed by the sortal rule addendum would prevent us from admitting this as a possibility . Hence " animal " can not be a sortal.5 One rather serious defect of this argument , I think , is the controversial status of the initial assumption that we can conceive of a continuous succession of animal-stages which contains dogstages followed by nondog-stages . If a dog changed gradually into a cat is it clear that we would have an animal during the intermediary stage of this process ( an animal that is , perhaps , no particular sort of animal ) ? On the other hand if the dog changed instantaneously into a cat it may certainly be doubted that we have the requisite degree of qualitative continuity . Even if this objection strikes someone as not very pressing with respect to the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly have to be taken seriously if the argument is to be generalized to cover all cases . Another , somewhat more pedestrian , case that we might consider is that of " shirt " and " article of clothing . " Certainly a shirt might be cut and resewn to form an article of clothing of a different sort , e.g. , a scarf . Here we would presumably want to treat " shirt " as a substance sortal and say that one article of clothing ( i.e. , the shirt ) went out of existence and another article of clothing ( i.e. , the scarf ) came into existence . But it is doubtful that this sort of possibility proves " article of clothing " to be a nonsortal , since we might certainly question whether we have in this case a continuous succession of stages of articles of clothing , whether , that is , the tattered bit of cloth found in the transition stage from the shirt to the scarf counts as an article of clothing . If we countenanced the principle that a substance sortal can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left floundering over which terms to count as sortals , and which of these to count as substance sortals . If counting " dog " as a substance sortal actually forced us not to count " animal " as a sortal 5 . Wiggins holds that " animal " is not a proper sortal , but his reasons may not depend on the sort of argument just given . Cf. Wiggins , ibid. , pp. 61-63.  | it is not at all clear what we want to say . For that matter we might begin to wonder whether even " dog " is a sortal , since it seems not implausible to treat terms like " terrier " and " spaniel , " which are subordinate to " dog , " as substance sortals . The doubts over which terms to reckon as substance sortals do not trouble me too much , since this notion does not figure in the sortal rule or its addendum , as I formulated these . But it would certainly be discomfiting to the present analysis if we had constantly to hesitate over reckoning any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinate to it might plausibly be reckoned a substance sortal . My suggestion would be to avoid this situation by rejecting the problematical principle that substance sortals can not be subordinate to other sortals . We can , I think , reasonably adopt a more permissive policy towards the application of " sortal " and " substance sortal . " A term can be reckoned a sortal , or substance sortal , so long as there is no conceivable situation which would constitute a relatively clearcut ( i.e. , nonborderline ) case in which the term fails to function as a sortal , or substance sortal . Thus I would want to count all of the terms " terrier , " " dog , " and " animal " as sortals on the grounds that there is , so far as I can tell , no conceivable situation which would constitute a relatively clearcut case in which a continuous succession of terrier-stages ( dog-stages , animal-stages ) failed to correspond to the career of a single persisting terrier ( dog , animal ) . And I would also count all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no conceivable situation which would constitute a relatively clearcut case in which the terminal points of a longest continuous succession of terrier-stages ( dog-stages , animal-stages ) failed to correspond to the coming into existence and going out of existence of a terrier ( dog , animal ) . We can conceive of borderline cases ( e.g. , a dog changing into a cat ) which , if they were to occur , might possibly force us ( perhaps on theoretical grounds ) to make new decisions as to which terms are sortals and which terms are substance sortals ( or even as to which terms are subordinate to which ) . But until such decisions need to be made we can reasonably adhere to the permissive policy of counting all of these terms as substance sortals . Other sortals such as " fat dog , " " white dog , " " dog in the yard , " and " puppy " remain as clearcut phase sortals.  | IV . Identity , Predication , and Constitution Earlier in the course of discussing the question whether sortals need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there could conceivably be , for sortal F , F-things whose space-time paths partly coincide and partly diverge . Though this question will remain open the following related proposition is quite definitely true : For different sortals F and G it may happen that the path of an F-thing and the path of a G-thing partly coincide and partly diverge . Consider again our one-branched tree on Monday . But this time imagine that at the beginning of Tuesday the tree 's branch is actually chopped off , so that all that remains of the tree on Tuesday is its trunk . We might certainly want to say in such a case , especially if the branch was fairly negligible , that the tree still persists on Tuesday , though it has been reduced to a trunk . If S is the succession which corresponds to the tree 's career from Monday through Tuesday and S ' corresponds to the trunk 's career during those two days , then S and S ' diverge on Monday and coincide on Tuesday . S , it may be noted , is similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk-stages discussed in the earlier example , except that in the present case , where the branch was actually chopped off , there is nothing weird about S , since S is just the path of the tree . So here we seem to have a rather clear case in which the path of an F-thing and the path of a G-thing partly coincide and partly diverge ( where F is the sortal " tree " and G is the sortal " trunk " ) . This kind of case , however , gives rise to a certain difficulty . It may seem perfectly legitimate in the case just imagined to make each of the following three assertions on Tuesday : ( a ) This tree is identical with ( is one and the same object as ) this trunk . ( b ) This tree was bigger yesterday . ( c ) This trunk was not bigger yesterday . The difficulty is that these three apparently true propositions seem to be logically incompatible with each other . If it is true , as ( a ) asserts , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it seems to follow that there is that one object which we can refer to both as " this tree " and " this trunk . " Well , was that object  | bigger yesterday or not ? If it was bigger then ( c ) must be false in asserting that it was not , and if it was not bigger then ( b ) must be false in asserting that it was . If the identity claim made by ( a ) does in fact commit us to holding that there is some object on Tuesday which we can refer to both as " this tree " and " this trunk " then there seems to be no satisfactory way around this difficulty . It would not help us to " relativize " our remarks about the object in question ( i.e. , the object that can be referred to as both " this tree " and " this trunk " ) by saying , for example , that the object was a bigger tree yesterday but was not a bigger trunk yesterday , or that the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the same trunk yesterday as a bigger object.6 These maneuvers , whatever their precise import might be , do not apparently help us at all to answer the question " What was the object 's size yesterday ? " It seems certain that this question must have an answer . If there is that particular object which we can refer to today as both " this tree " and " this trunk " then that object must have had some definite size yesterday , and that size was either bigger or not bigger than the size of the tree ( the trunk ) that is now presented to us . We can not possibly have it both ways . But if there is some single object to which we intend to refer when we say both " This tree was bigger " and " This trunk was not bigger " then we would be trying to have it both ways . Our difficulty is obviously not just with respect to the size of the tree and the trunk . The general problem is that there may be various properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk did not have . It may be , for example , that the trunk was never touched by human hands whereas somebody did touch the tree by touching its branch . Or it may be that yesterday , on Monday , the tree was partly white ( the branch having been white ) but the trunk was completely brown . But if there is some single object which we can refer to on Tuesday as both " this tree " and " this trunk " then clearly that object was either once touched 6 . Such relativizing maneuvers are suggested in P. T. Geach , Reference and Generality ( Cornell University Press , Ithaca , N.Y. , 1962 ) , p. 39ff. ; and are criticized in Wiggins , Identity and Spatio-Temporal Continuity , part one , and in Sydney Shoemaker , " Wiggins on Identity , " Philosophical Review , 79 ( 1970 ) , 530-35-  | by human hands or not , and it was either once partly white or not . The only sensible move to make here , I think , is to deny that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday as both " this tree " and " this trunk . " And to deny this is quite certainly to assert , on the contrary , that there is one object which we can refer to as " this tree " and another object which we can refer to as " this trunk . " We must assert , in other words , that the tree and the trunk are , at least in some important sense , not identical with each other , that the tree is one thing and the trunk is another thing . We can also acknowledge , however , that there is a sense in which , as ( a ) correctly asserts , the tree and the trunk are identical with each other . In a sense they are not identical , but in a sense they are . In line with a good deal of recent literature I will distinguish these senses as " strict identity " and " constitutive identity . " 7 We might define " x is constitutively identical with y " ( or " x and y constitute each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same place . " It is in this sense that we can say that the tree and the trunk are identical on Tuesday , for the tree and the trunk occupy the same place on Tuesday . There is , at least with respect to the most obvious cases , a rather straightforward connection between " constitutive identity , " in the defined sense of spatial coincidence , and the intuitive notion of constitution ( composition ) . Roughly put , if two things are constitutively identical , in the sense of occupying the same place , then they must be composed of the same matter . But I do not want to enter into a discussion of material composition until a later stage . For my immediate purposes the definition of " constitutive identity , " in terms of spatial coincidence , suffices to draw the required contrast with " strict identity . " I will not attempt to define " x is strictly identical with y , " as it is highly doubtful that this notion can be defined in any useful way . But the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be indicated in two related ways . First , where a and b are singular terms which refer to individ7 . See Wiggins , Identity and Spatio-Temporal Continuity , p. toff. ; R. M. Chisholm , " Parts as Essential to Their Wholes , " Review of Metaphysics , 26 ( 1973 ) , 587ff. ; and Shoemaker , " Wiggins on Identity , " b31ff.  | ual objects the statement " a is strictly identical with b " implies that there is some single object to which both a and b refer . On the other hand , " a is constitutively identical with b " does not imply this . We can not say that the tree is identical with the trunk in the strict sense because , as we saw , we can not coherently suppose that there is some object to which both " the tree " and " the trunk " refer . Second , it is strict identity , but not constitutive identity , which satisfies the logical principle of substitutivity ( " Leibniz 's Law " ) , according to which if x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , present , and future , must be the same as y 's . It seems selfevident that we have a concept of identity which satisfies this principle . It was this principle which I tacitly employed when I argued in effect that the tree and the trunk can not be strictly identical since they have different past histories . We can say , however , that the tree and the trunk are constitutively identical , that they occupy the same place , without implying that their past ( or future ) properties are the same . If we conceive of the relationship between the tree and the trunk in terms of the successions or space-time paths associated with them it becomes very easy ( in a sense , perhaps , too easy ) to understand how the difference between strict and constitutive identity arises . There is certainly nothing difficult in the abstract about the " Y " - shaped configuration of two successions of items which differ up to a point but then share some segment in common . Looked at in this way the tree and the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of thinking about the matter helps to relieve the sense of paradox in saying that objects that are not strictly identical may occupy the same place at once . The commonsense dictum that two things can not occupy the same place at the same time remains correct , however , on the interpretation that if x and y occupy the same place then x and y must be identical in at least the constitutive sense . If x and y are constitutively identical at a given time t then their properties may differ radically both before and after t . This is the essential contrast with strict identity . On the other hand , if we consider only time t , since at that time x and y occupy the same place ( and are composed of the same matter ) , they will evidently have to share their properties at that time ( or , at least ,  | they will have to share at that time such straightforward properties as size , shape , color , location ) . Hence constitutive identity is , so to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the ordinary locution " x is ( one and the same as , identical with ) y " can be used in both senses . It will be seen that constitutive identity requires a temporal qualification . The tree and the trunk are constitutively identical on Tuesday but not on Monday . On the other hand it seems evident ( though I will not attempt to prove this ) that an ascription of strict identity can not be temporally qualified . It would make no sense to say that x and y existed on Monday and Tuesday , that x and y were strictly one and the same on Monday , but that x and y were not strictly one and the same on Tuesday . This would make as little sense as saying that there was an object that existed on Monday and Tuesday , and it was identical with itself on Monday but not on Tuesday . When the space-time paths associated with objects partly coincide and partly diverge we have a case in which two ( strictly ) different objects occupy the same place at one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when both of them exist . Thus the tree and the trunk occupy the same place on Tuesday and do not occupy the same place on Monday , though both objects exist on Monday . There is , however , another kind of case in which different objects occupy the same place . It may happen that the path associated with the object x is a segment of the longer path associated with the object y . In this case x and y will occupy the same place at every moment that x exists , but x and y are not strictly identical since y exists at times when x does not exist . A possible example of such a case is the following . Suppose that a lump of gold is made into a coin in 1940 , and that the coin persists until 196o at which time it is melted down into a lump of gold . In such a case we might certainly want to say that the coin came into existence in 1940 and went out of existence in 1g6o . We may also want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire period . The space-time path associated with the coin is then a segment of the longer path associated with the lump of gold . If I held the coin in my hand in 1950 I might want to assert the following three propositions :  | ( d ) The coin in my hand is identical with the lump of gold in my hand . ( e ) The coin in my hand did not exist before 1940. ( f ) The lump of gold in my hand existed before 1940 . If we did not already have available the distinction between strict and constitutive identity we might perhaps have been tempted to maneuver around this case by denying either ( e ) or ( f ) . ( To deny ( e ) would be to deny that " coin " is a substance sortal , while to deny ( f ) would be to deny that " lump of gold " is a sortal . ) Given the distinction , however , it seems that the most plausible expedient is to maintain both ( e ) and ( f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not strict , but mere constitutive identity . The coin and the lump of gold are strictly two objects , but they occupy the same place at every moment that the coin exists . I have presented two examples , of slightly different sorts , in which we need to say that two strictly distinct objects occupy the same place at once . Other examples of both sorts could evidently be found . It is not entirely clear , however , just how common we ought to consider such cases to be . This will depend , in part , on how broadly we employ the notion of an " object . " A point which must , I think , remain valid is that such cases occur in a severely circumscribed and tightly controlled fashion , and are in an important sense exceptions to the rule . It still remains correct to say , as I did earlier , that it would seem deeply inconsonant with our intuitive notion of persistence to conceive of the careers of objects as crisscrossing and overlapping in an endless and unmanageably complicated variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies a correlative distinction between two senses in which a sortal may be said to apply to an object . When I hold the coin in my hand in the previous example I might certainly want to say " This lump of gold is a coin " ( and , also , " This coin is a lump of gold " ) . But there is obviously a difficulty about saying this . For if the lump of gold is a coin , then it seems that it should be correct to call it " a coin . " It should therefore be correct to say , in virtue of the fact that the lump of gold existed before 1940 , " A coin which is now in my hand existed before 1940 , " or " There is now a coin in my hand which existed before 1940 , " or " This coin existed  | before 1940 . " But this is precisely what we can not say , for the coin did not exist until 1940 . What is evidently required here is a distinction between two senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding to the two senses of identity . In order for it to be correct to say " x is a coin " in the strict predicative sense it must also be correct to say " x is strictly identical with a coin . " Since the lump of gold is not strictly identical with any coin we can not say that the lump of gold is a coin , in the predicative sense . There is however another sense of " x is a coin " which implies merely " x is constitutively identical with a coin . " It is only in this weaker constitutive sense that we can correctly say that the lump of gold is a coin . The constitutive , but nonpredicative , application of the term " coin " to the lump of gold does not permit us to refer to the lump of gold as " the ( some , a ) coin . " This distinction between the predicative and constitutive application of a sortal to an object affects the earlier characterization of what it means for one sortal to be subordinate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G if the predicative application of F to an object entails the predicative application of G to the object . Hence " dog " is subordinate to " animal " because if something is , in the predicative sense , a dog ( and can be referred to as " the dog " ) it must be , in the predicative sense , an animal ( and can be referred to as " the animal " ) . But it is not sufficient for F to be subordinate to G that the constitutive application of F should entail the constitutive application of G. " Gold coin " is not subordinate to " lump of gold " even though " x is ( constitutively ) a gold coin " entails " x is ( constitutively ) a lump of gold . " This point is essential to our account , for if " gold coin " were reckoned as subordinate to " lump of gold " the principle of prolongation would prevent us from saying that a gold coin goes out of existence when it is melted down into a lump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say that part of knowing our language consists in having in effect learned which sortals are subordinate to which , and resultantly which sortals can be predicatively tied to each other , and which sorts of objects can be strictly identical with each other . ) It is now possible to characterize substance sortals in a manner which might earlier have been open to misunderstanding . F is  | a substance sortal if the terminal points of a longest continuous F-succession correspond to the coming into existence and going out of existence of a single persisting F-thing . This implies the important principle that , where F is a substance sortal , if F is predicatively true of an object at any moment then F must remain predicatively true of the object until it goes out of existence . Hence a coin ( i.e. , something which is , in the predicative sense , a coin ) must continue to be a coin until it ceases to exist . This valid principle about substance sortals must , however , be properly distinguished from the false statement that , where F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an object at any moment then F must remain constitutively true of the object until it goes out of existence . A lump of gold might be ( constitutively ) a coin at one moment but not be a coin at a later moment that it exists . V. The Compositional Criterion The sortal rule tells us that spatiotemporal and qualitative continuity under a sortal is a sufficient condition for an object 's persistence . We want now to formulate a supplementary condition which would allow us to judge , for example , that a watch which is taken apart and goes out of existence may retain its identity when it is later put back together . One important feature of this sought after condition is that if x and y are judged to be identical on the basis of compositional considerations then there must presumably be some sortal F which is predicatively true of both x and y . We want to allow for the possibility of a watch being taken apart and later coming back into existence as a watch , or a car being completely dismantled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that the watch should come back into existence as a car , or vice versa . A moment ago I mentioned the principle that if F is a substance sortal ( like " watch " or " car " ) then if F is ever predicatively true of the object x , F must remain true of x until x goes out of existence . But it seems that we should now strengthen this principle to read : If F is a substance sortal then if F is ever predicatively true of x , F must remain true of x at any moment when x exists ( even if x should perhaps come back into existence after going out of existence ) . A first approximation to the compositional criterion might be :  | ( I ) Where x is an object that exists at time tl and y is an object that exists at a later time t2 , a sufficient condition for x to be identical with y is that some sortal is predicatively true of both x at ti and y at t2 , and some set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at t2 . To apply the compositional criterion we pick out the F-thing x at some early time ti and the F-thing y at some later time t2 ( where F is a sortal ) . We then consider whether x 's parts at t1 are identical with y 's parts at t2 . This judgment about the identity through time of the parts is made on the basis of the sortal rule , upon which the compositional criterion is dependent . The criterion as thus formulated , however , is too stringent in one respect and too lax in another . We certainly want to be able to say that if a watch is taken apart it can retain its identity even if some small number of parts are replaced when it is put back together . In this case there would be no single set of objects which exhaustively comprises the watch before and after it is repaired . We need to relax the condition to require of x at ti and y at l2 not compositional identity , but merely compositional similarity . This latter requirement is roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of both x at tl and y at t2 . On the other hand even if some single set of objects does exhaustively comprise x at t , and y at t2 it is not clear that this would be sufficient to induce us to say that x is identical with y . We may require that the set of objects that comprises x at ti and y at t2 should be similarly arranged in x at ti and y at t2 . If a sweater is completely unravelled and the wool used to make a sweater again then , unless we somehow had reason to think that the wool was arranged the second time like the first , I think we should not be much inclined to say that we had the same sweater . A better formulation might then be : ( 2 ) Where x is an object that exists at time ti and y is an object that exists at a later time t2 , a sufficient condition for x to be identical with y is that some sortal is predicatively true of both x at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects comprises a major portion of both x at ti and y at t2 , and this set of objects is similarly arranged in both x at tl and y at t2.  | What counts as a " major portion " of an object is evidently quite vague , and many borderline cases can , and actually do , arise in this connection . Brute considerations of bulk or volume will certainly matter considerably in determining what is a major portion , but it may also matter whether the portion contains parts that seem especially relevant to the object 's being ( called ) the sort that it is . If the car x is dismantled at ti and some of its parts are used to construct the car y at t2 , then x 's having the same engine at ti as y has at t2 would seem to count more in favor of saying that x is identical with y than would the fact that x has the same airconditioner at t , as y has at t2 . If compositional similarity under a sortal , as expressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows immediately that so is compositional continuity under a sortal . Suppose that x is a car which is dismantled on Monday and a major portion of its parts , in similar arrangement , are used on Tuesday to construct the car y . Suppose , further , that y is dismantled Tuesday night and a major portion of its parts , in similar arrangement , are used on Wednesday to construct the car z . It may of course happen that no set of parts comprises a major portion of both x on Monday and z on Wednesday . ( This possibility might be schematically represented as follows . On Monday x is comprised of the parts A , B , and C ; on Tuesday y is comprised of the parts A , B , and C ' ; and on Wednesday z is comprised of the parts A , B ' , and C ' . If two parts in common counts as a major portion we get the mentioned possibility . ) But it would still follow from ( 2 ) that x and z are identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and y are identical and that y and z are identical , and ( by the " transitivity of identity " ) if x and y are identical and y and z are identical it must follow that x and z are identical . This case could obviously be elaborated in such a way that ( 2 ) forces us to judge that an object x , which is picked out at t1 , is identical with an object y , which is picked out at t2 , even where no parts are common to x at ti and y at t2 . It is a quite unavoidable and generally satisfactory corollary of ( 2 ) that an object may retain its identity through a drastic or even total alteration of its parts , so long as this alteration takes place by a continuous sequence of small changes , each small change leaving the object with a major portion of the similarly arranged parts that it had prior to the change . This condition of " compositional continuity , " it should be noted , may be satis-  | fled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the case just discussed , in which an object goes out of existence and comes back into existence . It seems perfectly evident that the condition of compositional similarity defined in ( 2 ) , and the correlative condition of cornpositional continuity , depend outright on some prior notion of persistence in terms of which we can understand what it means to talk about the persistence of the parts which make up an object . This is why I urged earlier that compositional considerations must be construed as merely supplemental to more primary criteria . There seems however to be a rather deeply rooted tendency among philosophers to treat compositional considerations as primary . Often , as in the case of Locke 's treatment of the identity of organic bodies , this tendency takes the form of the suggestion that our concept of the persistence of familiar observable objects is to be understood in terms of the idea that the atomic particles which compose these objects are replaced only gradually.8 Apart from leaving unanswered the question " And what does the persistence of an atom consist in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our everyday concept of familiar and observable cases of persistence can not plausibly be regarded as analyzable in terms of the highly theoretical concept of the persistence of atoms . It can not be that what I judge ( and observe ) to be the case when I assert , for example , " This car has persisted for the past few moments " is some theoretical fact about the comings and goings of invisible atoms . Once it is conceded that our concept of the car 's persistence is not primarily to be understood , via the compositional criterion , in terms of the persistence of exotic atomic particles , there seems little temptation to suggest instead that this concept is primarily to be understood , via the compositional criterion , in terms of the persistence of such smaller familiar objects as engines , fenders , wheels , etc. , where the persistence of these smaller objects is then explained in the noncompositional terms of the sortal rule . Admittedly in order for something to be ( called ) a car it must presumably stand in various typical compositional relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of the persistence of 8 . John Locke , An Essay Concerning Human Understanding , book 2 , chapter 27 , sections 3-6.  | an engine ( fender , wheel , etc. ) is primarily to be understood , via the sortal rule , in terms of the idea of a spatiotemporally and qualitatively continuous succession of engine-stages ( fender-stages , wheel-stages , etc. ) , then it seems equally correct to say that our concept of the persistence of a car is also primarily to be understood , via the sortal rule , in terms of the idea of a spatiotemporally and qualitatively continuous succession of car-stages . There would seem to be no point in treating our concept of the persistence of a relatively larger familiar object like a car in some fundamentally different way from our concept of the persistence of a relatively smaller familiar object like an engine or a fender . Whether an object is large or small the sortal rule is to be regarded as defining its primary identity condition , and the compositional criterion is merely supplementary . Nor is there any mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , we should allow compositional considerations to function as a supplement . Looked at in a certain way an object at any particular moment is nothing over and above the parts that make it up , arranged in a distinctive way . It seems therefore entirely natural , if not inevitable , that when we come across those same parts , or most of them , similarly arranged we should be inclined to say that we have the same object again . This inclination , however , is coherent only against the background of a more primary notion of persistence . I want to consider now a certain rather intriguing difficulty which besets the compositional criterion when it is formulated in some such manner as ( 2 ) above . The criterion , thus formulated , implies that compositional similarity , and hence compositional continuity , is sufficient for an object 's identity in all cases . The difficulty is that in some cases considerations of compositional similarity or continuity yield incompatible identity judgments . A famous case of this sort is that of " the ship of Theseus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship x , which , let us imagine , is made up entirely of wooden planks . We proceed gradually to replace x 's planks one by one until by December , perhaps , we wind up with a ship y , such that none of the planks which composed x in January compose y in December . Our criterion dictates that x and y are identical on the grounds of corn- 9 . See Thomas Hobbes , Concerning Body , chapter i i , section 7.  | positional continuity , on the grounds , that is , that the original ship retains its identity through each small compositional change . But suppose now that someone collected together all of the planks that were removed from the ship during that year , and he used those planks in December to construct the ship z , arranging the planks in just the way they were originally arranged in x in January . Our criterion obviously dictates that the original ship x is identical with z . In this imaginable case , then , our criterion yields the incoherent judgment that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y and z . My own somewhat ambivalent inclination when reflecting upon this case is to judge that x is identical with y and not with z.1 ? If this intuition is generally shared there would be two related ways to explain it . It will be noted that the judgment that x is identical with y follows from the sortal rule as well as from the compositional criterion , whereas the judgment that x is identical with z follows only from the compositional criterion . This is because if we start out with the original ship x in January and trace a spatiotemporally and qualitatively continuous succession of ship-stages we wind up with y in December . Hence we might say that x is identical with y and not with z because where the sortal rule conflicts with the compositional criterion the former rule , which we know to be primary , takes precedence . Or , forgetting about primacy , we might simply say that the sortal rule in conjunction with the compositional criterion outweighs the latter standing alone , and this is what favors x 's being identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the sortal rule and the compositional criterion might induce someone to suggest that the sortal rule ought to be weakened . Instead of expressing a logically sufficient condition of identity , as it does in its present formulation , the suggestion would be that it ought to express only a condition which counts logically in favor of identity , but which might in principle be defeated by competing compositional considerations , or perhaps by other kinds of overriding considerations as well . This suggestion for weakening the sortal rule certainly deserves to be taken seriously . So long as the considerations which might to . Wiggins , Identity and Spatio-Temporal Continuity , p. 37 , shares this intuition .  | override the sortal rule could be loosely specified in advance , and seen as built a priori into our identity concept , we would still have an acceptable kind of analysis of what our concept of identity consists in . Nevertheless I am inclined to resist any such weakening of the sortal rule . I think it is reasonable , barring some relatively clearcut counterexample , more simply to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatiotemporal and qualitative continuity under a sortal , as no less than logically sufficient for identity . Certainly we seem to have no convincing counterexample in cases like that of the ship of Theseus , at least if we agree that in such cases it is plausible to make the judgment which accords with the sortal rule.I " We might indeed wish to reformulate the compositional criterion so as to accommodate cases like that of the ship of Theseus , and to provide that in such cases the favored identity judgment is the one that accords with the sortal rule . One rather straightforward way of accomplishing this , I suggest , is explicitly to limit the application of the compositional criterion to just those situations for which we had originally invoked the criterion , i.e. , to situations in which an object goes out of existence and comes back into existence . Looked at in this way , the compositional criterion has no bearing on the case of the ship of Theseus , since in that case when we trace the original ship according to the sortal rule we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . Perhaps , then , the compositional criterion ( clearly ) applies only in a case in which x goes out of existence at ti and y comes into existence at t2 , and x 's composition at tl is appropriately similar to y 's composition at t2 . This still does not get it quite right , though . We need to rule out a more complicated variant of the ship of Theseus case . Suppose that the ship x is completely dismantled early in January , and that the ship y is constructed later in January out of all of x 's parts ( say , wooden planks again ) , arranged in the same order . Then x is identical with y . But now suppose that y undergoes the process described earlier , in which all of its planks are gradually replaced , and in December a ship z is constructed out of those planks , arranged in the same old order . Then we do not want to say that x is identical with z , even II . Several other possible counterexamples will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it went out of existence was appropriately similar to z 's composition when it came into existence . Here y 's prior coming into existence with x 's old parts already preempted x 's identity and left no room for a compositional claim in behalf of z for x 's identity . Taking these points into account , and making explicit now the dependence of the compositional criterion upon the sortal rule ( including the addendum ) , a formulation of the criterion might be : The Compositional Criterion . Where ( the sortal rule would have us judge that ) an object x goes out of existence at t , and an object y comes into existence at a later time t2 , a sufficient condition for x to be identical with y is that ( the sortal rule would also have us judge that ) : ( I ) Some sortal F is such that F is predicatively true of x at t , and F is predicatively true of y at t2 ; and ( 2 ) Some objects are such that they comprise a major portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of y at t2 , and they are similarly arranged in x at t , and y at t2 ; and ( 3 ) There is no object z such that z comes into existence at a time t ' between t , and t2 , and conditions ( I ) and ( 2 ) ( substituting " z " for " y " and " t ' for " t2 " in these conditions ) would have us judge that x is identical with z . This completes my formulation of the sortal analysis of physical persistence . The overall analysis is to be understood as implying that a necessary and sufficient condition for an object 's persistence is that the object 's career exemplify either the primary criterion specified by the sortal rule or the supplementary compositional criterion . In the next two chapters I will raise two rather different kinds of questions about the adequacy of this analysis . My general assessment of it , however , is highly favorable . It is not easy to conceive of any situation , actual or imaginary , involving standard physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this analysis .  | ONE IMPORTANT difference between the simple continuity analysis ( discussed in Chapter i ) and the sortal analysis ( discussed in Chapter 2 ) comes out when we consider the following question : Can we analyze our concept of a physical object 's identity through time without taking cognizance of what sort of object we are dealing with ? Obviously the simple continuity analysis , which makes no reference to sortal differentiations , implies an affirmative answer to this question . That analysis attempts a wholly general and sortal-neutral account of physical persistence , and , as we saw , fails drastically in so doing . A negative answer to the question seems , on the other hand , indicated by the sortal analysis . The latter analysis is , to be sure , quite general in a sense , since the sortal rule is a single comprehensive formula which is intended to apply to physical objects of all sorts . Evidently , however , we can apply the rule to an object only insofar as we do take cognizance of what sort of object it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace the object under a sortal . Indeed the essential idea behind the sortal rule was that we need to divide objects into different sorts before we can adequately analyze our identity concept . In the present chapter I intend to argue that there is an important , albeit limited , extent to which we can analyze our concept of an object 's identity without taking cognizance of what sort of object it is . Though the simple continuity analy-  | sis was shown to be totally ineffective I will propose a modification of that analysis which preserves its sortal-neutral character . This proposal will not , however , imply a repudiation of the sortal analysis . For it is only the latter analysis which , I will maintain , can provide a relatively complete and accurate account of our fully elaborated concept of persistence . The proposed sortal-neutral analysis , on the other hand , will be able to provide no more than a partial account of our concept of persistence , but one which can plausibly be regarded as capturing the basic kernel of that concept . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be equally important to appreciate both the scope and the limits of a sortal-neutral account of persistence . One extreme position which I want to contest is that our concept of persistence is at its very roots dependent upon sortal differentiations . It is this extreme idea which Wiggins seems to be expressing when he says that there could not be " any usable account of what it is , in general , to make a mistake or avoid a mistake in tracing an object a .... To trace a I must know what a is : " He then explains that to know " what an object is " in the relevant sense is to be able to apply a special kind of term to the object , viz. a sortal . It is only by reference to an applicable sortal that we can understand what it means to trace the object . Wiggins is apparently claiming that our identity criteria are dependent upon sortals in a very radical way . When he says that we can give no usable account of our identity criteria in sortal-neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply that we could give no completely accurate account in such terms . He seems to be implying that we could not even formulate a usefully close approximation to our identity criteria without appealing to sortals , that we could not even formulate an account which works for the most part.2 This position strikes me as intuitively quite implausible . I am prepared to believe that our sortal classifications affect our identity criteria in various significant respects . But should it not also be possible to formulate some underlying general rule of identity which cuts through those sortal classifications , a rule which it 1 . Wiggins , Identity and Spatio-Temporal Continuity , p. 35. 2 . It may possibly be that Wiggins does not mean to imply this extreme position , but the fact that his account of persistence is from start to finish inextricably tied to sortals leaves the strong impression that he does .  | would he correct to follow , if not always , at least almost always ? When we consider what it means to trace the careers of such sortally diverse objects as , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels of cars , certainly our intuitive impression is that , though there might be certain nuances of difference between the tracing rules which we follow in these cases , there must also be a significant common denominator running through all these cases , one which could supply a usable , even if not absolutely accurate , handle on all of them . The implausibility of the extreme contention that our identity criteria are totally dependent upon sortal differentiations can be brought out by reflecting upon the following obvious fact . A person will frequently be able correctly to trace the career of a new sort of object without requiring any information as to what the identity criteria are for that new sort . Certainly the simplest ( though , perhaps , not the only possible ) explanation of this fact is that the person is applying the same criteria to the new case that he has already learned to use in the old cases . But this implies that , contrary to the extreme position , there are usable general criteria which cut through sortal divisions . We can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm who knows a substantial amount of English but who has never seen or heard of a car , or , to make the case even purer , has never seen or heard of any transporting vehicle . He is now shown a car for the first time in his life , say , a blue and white car moving across an open field . There is no doubt that he is immediately in the position to say such things as " That big blue and white thing ( with the four round black things on the bottom ) is moving across the field . " In these circumstances it would seem natural to assume that the child is using the expression " that big blue and white thing ( with the four round black things on the bottom ) " to refer to the same object that we might refer to as " that car . " And , what is critical in the present connection , having referred ( in his way ) to the car he seems perfectly competent to trace the car as it moves across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations on his ability to reidentify the car over longer periods or in more complicated circumstances . It seems quite certain that his ability to reidentify the car would not be in the least stymied by such typical alterations of the car  | as its doors opening and shutting , its wheels turning , or its windshield wipers starting to move . He seems , in short , capable of getting on quite well without the allegedly special identity criteria relativized to the sortal " car . " This is evidence that in fact no such radical sortal-relativization is necessary , that in fact the general concept of the identity of an object provides , if not all , at least a significant part of the identity criteria that we ordinarily need . Or consider another example . Suppose that you know of someone , say an Eskimo , who has never before seen a tree . Imagine that you bring this person to a tree and say to him ( in his language ) , " Keep your eye on that object . " If when you say this you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you make the appropriate " sweeping gesture of ostension , " as Quine calls it , 3 there is every likelihood that you can get your Eskimo friend to focus on the tree , rather than on one of its parts or on some larger portion of the landscape . On the other hand there is no reason to expect that by focusing on one isolated tree he would thereby immediately come to understand the general sortal concept of a tree , a general concept , that is , which he would apply to all and only trees . Presumably he may remain quite ignorant of that sortal concept until he is shown some fair selection of trees and , perhaps , hears some single word applied to them . But would his ignorance of the sortal prevent him from tracing the tree , from " keeping his eye on it " in an essentially normal way ? This seems wholly implausible . Even if you proceeded to break a leaf off the tree , or rub some dirt on it , or bend one of its branches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sortal ignorance , would correctly reidentify the tree through these changes . ( This could be shown by the answers he gives , or the pictures he draws , in response to the question " What happened to the object I asked you to keep your eye on ? " ) Again , the simplest explanation of what is going on here is that he is employing a concept of identity which does not , at least in any radical way , depend upon sortals. 3 . W. V. Quine , The Roots of Reference ( Open Court Publishing Co. , Illinois , 1974 ) , p. 53.  | I am not suggesting that someone 's sortal ignorance is likely to have no effect at all on his identity judgments . It may seem immediately plausible to expect that sortal ignorance might sometimes generate what I earlier called nondrastic identity-deviations , i.e. , conflations of cases in which x and y are identical with cases in which x goes out of existence and turns into y . The child who does not know the sortal " car " might very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked out persists in a flattened form after it is subjected to the crushing machine . And there may even be some rather special cases , as I will show shortly , in which sortal ignorance can lead to drastic identity-deviations . What seems quite incontrovertible , however , is that someone who is presented with a new sort of object will by and large be able to trace the object in an essentially correct manner , even though he knows of no sortal under which to trace the object . Certainly there is no serious possibility that someone 's sortal ignorance could lead him to trace any of the completely aberrant-seeming paths which showed up in earlier discussions . We are entirely confident , for example , that the child who has never before heard of a car would undoubtedly describe the scene of a car moving out of a garage in terms of the essentially correct idea of an object maintaining its size while moving from inside to outside , and would not , in those circumstances , trace a shrinking object along the path of an " incar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ignorance of the sortal " tree " might perhaps lead him to trace an object along a path which combines tree-stages and trunk-stages ( where we are imagining , of course , that the tree was not actually reduced to its trunk ) . The path of the shrinking incar , and the path which combines tree-stages and trunk-stages , evidently clash with our ordinary identity concept in some general way which does not depend upon the role of sortals . This is presumably why we are confident that no one ( or , perhaps more cautiously , no one who operates with our ordinary concept of identity ) , regardless of his sortal ignorance , would trace an object along those aberrant paths . It must then be possible to formulate an analysis of our identity concept which is independent of sortal differentiations at least to the extent of enabling us to explain , in sortal-neutral terms , why such paths are aberrant.  | II . The Basic Rule We are essentially back at the problem that we faced at the beginning of Chapter 2 , but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuity considerations could not even exclude the obvious kinds of aberrant paths just mentioned , and we sought some other considerations which would accomplish this . The solution which then suggested itself was the sortal rule , i.e. , that an object 's career must be continuously traced under a sortal . At present , however , we have found reason to impose an additional constraint on our problem , a constraint that was not satisfied by the previous solution . We now need to elicit some rule of identity which is independent of sortal differentiations but which is nevertheless adequate at least to exclude the most obvious kinds of aberrant paths , so that someone could rely on this rule to judge correctly of an object 's identity in most ordinary circumstances without having to apply any sortal to the object . It is not to be anticipated , however , that the sortal-neutral rule now being sought will supersede the sortal rule , for it seems rather clear already , and will become more clear as we go along , that only the latter rule can adequately explain various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the sortal-neutral rule and the sortal rule is rather that of the basic core of a concept to its more fully sophisticated elaboration . The former rule must capture , in a way that the latter does not , that most basic and elementary idea of persistence which we confidently expect anyone to employ regardless of his sortal ignorance . Let us consider again the Eskimo looking at the tree , which we will now imagine undergoes no qualitative change at all during this stretch of observation . Suddenly he turns to us and says , " The object I was looking at was first rather wide and very oddly shaped , but then it changed and now it is much thinner and cylindrically shaped . " As he says this perhaps he also gestures with his hands in a way which suggests first the outline of a whole tree and then the outline of a tree trunk . In other words , he has in effect judged that the original tree is now identical with the trunk . This , we are quite certain , could never happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of identity which we expect him to be following , and which would  | preclude that incredible judgment ? It can not be a rule so simple as to be definable purely in terms of continuity considerations , since we know that any number of perfectly continuous paths could in fact be traced from the tree at one moment to the trunk at a later moment . Nor , on the other hand , can it be anything as sophisticated as the sortal rule which we expect him to follow , since by hypothesis he lacks the conceptual resources for the application of that rule . That is our puzzle . When we reflect on this puzzle we might initially be inclined to respond like this : " Why would he judge that the object changed in size and shape when nothing happened ? " This response is , I think , essentially on the right track , but it is not helpful as it stands . For if what is meant is that " nothing happened to the tree , " well , then that just begs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how the Eskimo is in the position to make any correct judgments about what happened or did not happen to that persisting object . And if what is meant is that " nothing happened period , " this is just wrong , since doubtless many things happened of which the Eskimo was aware when he watched the tree , e.g. , a cloud may have moved behind the tree . What we intuitively want to say , I think , is : " But nothing happened to make him judge that the object changed in those ways . " The key words here are " to make him judge . " Our intuition seems to be that when someone traces the career of an object he will not countenance a change in the object unless he has to . We imagine that the Eskimo fixes his attention on that tall oddly shaped object and then traces its career by following a continuous space-time path that is as stable , as unchanging , as he can get it to be . Perhaps he did see a cloud move behind the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else , which would force him to give up the stabilizing judgment " The object is still the same size and shape " in favor of the change-countenancing judgment " The object changed its size and shape . " This is why we are certain that he would make the former judgment and not the latter . The basic sortal-neutral identity rule which we confidently expect to govern the Eskimo 's thought might then be put roughly : Trace an object 's career by following a spatiotemporally  | and qualitatively continuous path which minimizes changes as far as possible . We just saw how this rule explains the Eskimo 's judgment in the case where the tree actually suffers no qualitative change while it is being observed . But the same explanation is also straightforwardly applicable to many cases in which the tree does change . Suppose that while the Eskimo watches , a leaf is broken off the tree . We are certain that this change in the tree could not induce the Eskimo to judge that the tree has turned into the trunk . The change-minimizing condition immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's identity judgments should minimize change as far as possible . What must be assessed , therefore , are degrees of change , and this assessment is at least quite often perfectly clearcut . When the leaf is broken off the tree the Eskimo has no choice but to countenance some degree of change in the tree , a change which we can perhaps loosely characterize as involving an element of size and shape . But he is in no way forced to countenance the relatively greater change in size and shape that would be entailed by judging that the tree has turned into the trunk . This is why he would never make that judgment . When we try to apply the change-minimizing condition to the other aberrant path we needed to exclude , the path of the shrinking incar , we come up against a fairly serious complication . We would like to be able to say that anyone , no matter what his sortal ignorance , would trace a car leaving a garage in the ordinary way , and not in the incar-outcar way , because the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct on the grounds that tracing the car in the ordinary way does not involve countenancing any such alterations in size and shape as is suffered by the shrinking incar . But what should we say about the fact that the incar is relatively more stable than the car in the following respect : the incar remains wholly inside a garage whereas the car does not ? Since the path of the incar minimizes change in at least this respect how exactly does the change-minimizing condition dictate that the car be traced in the ordinary way ? A somewhat ad hoc answer to this question , which seems nevertheless to ring true , is that stability with respect to a merely  | locational property like being wholly in a garage simply does not count in assessing which of two paths minimizes change . This answer would seem considerably less ad hoc if it could be generalized to read : None of an object 's relational properties ( i.e. , no facts about how an object is related to other objects ) count in applying the change-minimizing condition . We might then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not count by connecting this proviso to the intuitive idea that an object must be in some sense self-complete , which implies , perhaps , that an object 's ( rule of ) identity must not depend upon how it is related to other objects . The generalized proviso , however , despite its element of attraction , is too problematical . For one thing it is not sufficiently clear in practice where to draw the line between relational and nonrelational properties , since the ascription of almost any property might plausibly be regarded as entailing a comparison between objects . Furthermore , we will see in the next section that some rather special properties which are pretty clearly relational do apparently count significantly in making a change-minimizing judgment . I think , therefore , that our most promising approach is simply to lay down the more specific proviso that locational properties do not count in applying the change-minimizing condition . We might define a locational property as one which can be signified by an expression of the form " being in such and such a spatial relation to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside ( on top of , to the left of , in contact with ) a ( the ) garage ( roof , red thing ) . " This notion might be further clarified by reference to specific cases , as the need arises . We can say , perhaps , that an object 's locational properties constitute at any moment the object 's most obvious and direct relations to other objects . Hence a loose connection might still be upheld between the intuitive idea that an object must be self-complete , that its identity can not depend upon any other object , and the proviso that when we trace an object 's career along a change-minimizing path we discount mere locational changes . My proposal , then , is that our most basic idea of the persistence of an object ( which coincides approximately , but not exactly , with the more fully developed idea ) can be analyzed in terms of the following sortal-neutral rule of identity .  | The Basic ( Change-Minimizing ) Rule . A sufficient condition for a succession S of object-stages to correspond to stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( 1 ) S is spatiotemporally continuous ; and ( 2 ) S is qualitatively continuous ; and ( 3 ) S minimizes change ( discounting mere change of location ) . The basic rule might also be supplemented by a suitable version of the compositional criterion . I will not work out this detail . Let us try to get clearer as to what the change-minimizing condition ( 3 ) amounts to when we consider this in terms of successions of object-stages . A succession S minimizes change if , roughly , any divergence from S would involve more change than S does . That is , S minimizes change if , for any succession S ' which is such that S and S ' partly coincide and partly diverge , S ' contains more change at the time of divergence than S does . Suppose S is the succession corresponding to the tree from 3:00 to 3:1o , and S ' is the aberrant succession which combines the tree-stages from 3:oo to 3:05 with the trunk-stages from 3:05 to 3:10 . Then S and S ' coincide from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " time of divergence " would then be 3:05 . We want to say that S ' is aberrant because it contains more change at the time of divergence 3:05 than S does . What this means is that if we compare S 's object-stages at times very close to 3:05 we find that they are more similar to each other than are the object-stages of S ' around 3:05 . It should be noted that it is only comparisons around the time of divergence that matter . S ' would obviously still be aberrant even if it should seem reasonable to judge that over the entire interval from 3:0o to 3:10 S ' contains on the whole less change than S does . This might happen if the tree undergoes various changes from 3:05 to 3:10 whereas the trunk is relatively unchanging during that five minutes . Then S ' would contain a relatively larger change than S at 3:05 but relatively less change after 3:05 . Still S ' is aberrant and S is change-minimizing , because at 3:05 , the time of their divergence , S contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we trace an object 's career we evidently do not countenance a needless change at a given mo-  | ment just to assure greater stability at later moments . ( The implications of such a tracing strategy are completely alien to us ; e.g. , if there were a very stable object in the neighborhood we would try to trace all paths to that object . ) The change-minimizing condition ( 3 ) of the basic rule might then be put somewhat more strictly as : ( 3 ' ) For any succession S ' , if S and S ' partly coincide and partly diverge and t is their time of divergence , then object-stages in S at times very close to t are more similar to each other than are object-stages in S ' at times very close to t ( discounting mere locational similarity ) . III . Limitations of the Basic Rule The basic rule does , I think , adequately accomplish the task originally set for it , viz. to express in sortal-neutral terms that most elementary conception of persistence which anyone can rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic rule yields ( what we ordinarily regard as ) correct identity judgments in several specific cases , and these cases could obviously be multiplied without difficulty . It seems fairly clear , in fact , that these cases are representative of the vast majority . The application of the basic rule yields identity judgments which coincide for the most part with the ones which we actually make , and this is why we confidently expect anyone to trace an object in an essentially ordinary way even if he is unable to apply any sortals to the object . It is now necessary to appreciate the important correlative point , that the basic rule provides only a good approximation to our operative identity scheme , but not a wholly accurate account of it . There is in fact a certain general disparity between the judgments of identity which we would make if we relied entirely on the basic rule and the judgments we actually make relying on sortal-relativized criteria . This is why the basic rule represents only a partial analysis of our identity concept , and needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious disparity between the basic rule and our actual identity judgments shows up in connection with some of the cases in which objects are said to come into existence or go out of existence . The rule that is evidently suggested ( if not  | entailed outright ) by the basic rule is that we should prolong an object 's career , backwards and forwards in time , so long as tracing a continuous and change-minimizing path allows . Or , to put this in a form corresponding to the sortal rule addendum , 4 the basic rule suggests that , where S is a continuous and change-minimizing succession , the beginning and end of S correspond respectively to the coming into existence and going out of existence of an object if and only if S is not the segment of a longer continuous and change-minimizing succession . Evidently this rule will not explain the kinds of judgments that we make about objects going out of existence and continuously turning into other objects . The basic rule would yield the ( conceptually ) incorrect judgment that a car persists in flattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can trace a continuous and change-minimizing path from the original car to the block of scrap that emerges . Or , to take another case , if a table is gradually whittled away so that it eventually goes out of existence and turns into a small lump of wood , the basic rule would have us judge instead that the table persisted through a decrease of size . Though there seems quite definitely to be a disparity between the basic rule and the judgments that we actually make in these kinds of cases ( i.e. , cases in which an object goes out of existence by continuously turning into another object ) , it should be noted that in many ( perhaps in most ) cases the basic rule yields the correct judgments about objects coming into existence and going out of existence . Suppose , for example , that a table is precipitously smashed to pieces . In such a case it is plausible to judge , as I earlier maintained , that there is no way at all to prolong the table 's career along a continuous path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge that the object has gone out of existence . Another kind of case in which the basic rule would lead to our judging correctly about an object going out of existence is if the object vanishes by merging indiscriminately into its environment . In such a case we can not continuously trace the object along a path which has any claim to being change-minimizing . If , for example , a number of cars are melted down into a single 4 . See Chapter 2 above , p. 52.  | indiscriminate mass then , though we could preserve continuity by arbitrarily identifying each car with some specified portion of the mass , there would be no plausible way to regard these identifications as change-minimizing since any number of other arbitrary identifications would be on an equal footing . Thus , in general , if there is no path which can be plausibly regarded as the distinctive change-minimizing one we can only say that the object has vanished and no longer exists . We might regard as a special case of this sort one in which an object continuously diminishes until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ice cube melts away . At the level of the basic rule , then , objects go out of existence ( by breakage , burning , etc. ) either when they are precipitously rendered into fragments or when they vanish by merging into their environments . These ways of ceasing to exist do represent , I think , the most fundamental sense in which an object might be said to go out of existence . But then there are also the other kinds of cases mentioned , where an object is said to go out of existence and continuously turn into another object , which the basic rule can not apparently explain . Now this limitation of the basic rule seems fairly marginal , and would in any case merely lead to nondrastic identity-deviations ( i.e. , judging that x is identical with y when the strict truth , in ordinary terms , is that x went out of existence and turned into y ) . There is , however , a far more fundamental limitation of the basic rule which I now want to explain . Though the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as wholes , in a wide variety of circumstances , it suffers from a general , and ultimately destructive , kind of vagueness . For there will be too many circumstances in which the rule will not clearly guide us in choosing which of a number of paths is to be treated as minimizing change . The kind of case which gives rise to this problem can be characterized generally as one in which , starting from a given object , we can trace continuous paths in different directions each of which minimizes change in a different respect . The few rather simple problem cases which I will now examine in order to illustrate this point are not intended merely to defeat the letter of the basic rule as formulated . For there would be nothing to prevent us from trying to retain the essential sortal-neutral character of the rule while emend-  | ing it with various additional provisos ( indeed the exclusion of locational properties is already such a proviso ) . But I think these examples will show that any attempt to force the basic rule to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no indication that we can formulate for even the most common cases a sortal-neutral procedure , accurately matching our actual identifying practices , for unambiguously choosing between conflicting paths which minimize change in different respects . This is the fundamental limitation of the basic rule and the essential reason why we eventually need to invoke the sortal rule . To begin with a very simple example , imagine that you have a red table and you decide to paint half of it black ( perhaps intending to finish the job later ) . As you apply the black paint the red expanse which initially coincides with the full extent of the table gradually diminishes in size as it is encroached upon by a widening black expanse . Now if you tried to trace the table according to the basic rule you would be faced with the following choice . You might decide that the way to minimize change is to preserve as far as possible stability of color . You would then judge that the original wholly red table remained wholly red while gradually diminishing in size until it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the correct way to minimize change is to preserve as far as possible stability of size . You would then make the ordinary judgment that the table 's color has altered . Perhaps it will be suggested that this is not really a hard conflict since in tracing the table in the ordinary way we preserve not only stability of size but also stability of shape , so that we thereby minimize change in the greatest number of respects . We might then consider adding to the basic rule the proviso that where two paths minimize change in different respects we must choose the path which minimizes change in more respects . But it seems doubtful that this proviso could really even cope with the present simple case , let alone more complicated ones . For suppose that the black paint significantly alters the texture and temperature of the surface to which it is applied . How should we then weigh up all the stabilities preserved by one possible path against all those preserved by its competitor ? This might still be dismissed as too easy a case since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ordinary way of tracing the table , viz. its stability as a separately movable thing ( that is , roughly , a detached thing that tends to move together with its parts ) . The property of being separately movable does , I think , strike us as possibly deserving to bear some special weight in tracing an object 's career . We might then consider adding to the basic rule the proviso that stability of separate movability outweighs any other stability in making a change-minimizing judgment . Note , incidentally , that separate movability seems a pretty clearcut relational property . This is one of the properties that I had in mind earlier when I said that we do not want simply to exclude all relational properties from being taken into account in change-minimizing judgments . But , aside from the fact that we will soon come across cases in which stability of separate movability is not favored in tracing an object , it is immediately obvious that any special appeal to this specific stability could not possibly provide a general solution to our difficulty . For we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of objects that are not , at least in any perfectly straightforward way , separately movable : for example , a fence , or a radiator , or a tree , or the wheel of a car , or , for that matter , a table that is securely fastened to something else ( e.g. , to the floor ) . We certainly can not rely on any general presumption that objects either are , or must remain , detached from other objects . It might still be suggested that the kind of change-minimizing conflict which could arise in the case of painting an object can easily be resolved by simply adding a proviso to the basic rule that minimizing change in size and shape weighs more than minimizing change in other respects . However , this suggestion will again fall far short of providing a generally applicable interpretation of the basic rule , since the mentioned proviso could certainly not qualify as a general principle , even if it works well enough for the specific kind of example just considered . There are many other examples in which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . Consider , for example , what happens when you add bumpers to a car which previously had none . To make this vivid suppose that the bumpers are imposingly large , prominently curvacious , and colored conspicuously different from the rest of the car . Here our  | ordinary identity criteria determine the judgment that the car which was orginally bumperless is now bebumpered , with the necessary implication that the car has altered somewhat in size , shape , and color distribution . But at the level of the basic rule we could just as well have traced the original car along a path which perfectly preserved size and shape , as well as color distribution . We could have done this simply by judging that the original car is now sandwiched between the bumpers but does not contain them as parts . Our operative identity criteria , which are relativized to the sortal " car , " determine us to trace a path which might be said , in crudely unanalyzed terms , to preserve the object 's stability as a whole car . However , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be no decisive reason to favor this stability over all the others that could be preserved in the alternative way of tracing . It is this last sort of case , in which objects are attached to each other , that presents what is perhaps the most serious difficulty for the basic rule.5 If the small object y is attached to the larger object x to yield the composite object x-with-y the basic rule will not clearly instruct us whether or not we are entitled to trace a continuous path which would identify x-with-y with the original x . ( Presumably the identification of x-with-y with the smaller y can be ruled out on grounds of insufficient continuity . ) Whether this identification of the composite object with the larger original component is permissible can only be determined by reference to the portal under which we are tracing the object : it will depend upon whether we can treat both x and x-with-y as coming under the same sortal . Though there is unquestionably a great degree of potential latitude in this decision , and we can think up any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many typical and obvious cases a sortal concept will provide a basis for deciding about the composition of an object that is brought under the sortal . Thus we identify the car-withbumpers with the original car-without-bumpers , and accordingly judge the car to have altered in size and shape , because we treat both the object-with-bumpers and the object-withoutbumpers as coming under the sortal " car " ; but we would almost 5 . Actually an exactly parallel difficulty arises when objects are detached from each other . Cf. the discussion later about the trunk-tree.  | certainly not say that the car altered in size and shape if , say , a small trailer or sled was attached to it , since we would not normally think of a trailer or sled as entering into the composition of a car . Nor , pretty obviously , would we say that a tree has altered in size or shape if some car bumpers are nailed onto it , since the car bumpers would not naturally be treated as part of the tree 's composition . Here , at least , are judgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might be urged that these latter cases actually suggest a more severe and perhaps fatally ubiquitous limitation of the basic rule . For should we not say that even where the small object y is merely brought into contact with the larger object x but not attached to it ( e.g. , an ashtray is placed on a table ) the basic rule will not clearly instruct us whether or not we should identify the composite x-with-y with the original x ( e.g. , whether or not we should judge that a table gets bigger when an ashtray is placed on it ) ? But this difficulty is , I think , not really serious . To deal with cases in which y is merely brought into contact with x but not attached to it we can safely lay down the general proviso ( which may no doubt admit of a few exceptions ) that tracing a change-minimizing path should not involve identifying the cohesive x with the fragmented x-with-y . The property of cohesiveness , by which I mean roughly being able to withstand various typical strains without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object 's career ( though this too is apparently a relational property ) . But in cases where y is attached to x there is apparently no property which we could properly single out to resolve the change-minimizing conflicts which would typically arise . I suggested earlier that someone , perhaps a child , who did not know the sortal " car " could still pick out a car as , e.g. , " the big blue and white thing , " and successfully trace its career in many ordinary circumstances . We are now in the position to understand why this is so . In many ordinary circumstances all that the child will need to trace the car is the basic rule . But we can now also take note of the kind of limitation which his ignorance of the sortal will impose upon the child 's tracing ability . Imagine indeed that for the winter a small yellow sled is attached to the back of the car . ( It will not , I think , necessarily matter whether or not the child knows the sortal " sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not . ) How will the child see this ? Will he see it , in the way we do , as the original blue and white thing maintaining its size and color but being attached to the yellow thing ? Or will he see it as the original blue and white thing becoming bigger and partly yellow , i.e. , as now containing the yellow thing as a part ? The basic rule provides no definite guidance . Tracing the first way , as we do , preserves stability of size and color , but tracing the second way preserves ( what may seem important ) stability of separate movability . ( Note that this is a kind of case in which the ordinary way of tracing does not favor separate movability . ) Which of these two ways of reidentifying the object might strike the child as most natural is unclear . There is here a genuine illusion of clarity because the grip of the sortal on our thought prevents us from experiencing the conflict which could be generated in such a case at the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict does exist can scarcely be questioned once one stops to compare this case , of attaching a sled to the car , with the case of attaching bumpers . Our sortal-relative criteria determine a relatively clear ( though not , certainly , an absolutely exact ) basis for making discrepant identity judgments in these cases , but it seems evident that from the child 's sortal-neutral vantage point there can be no relatively clear difference between the cases ( though there may be any number of obscure differences which might point him in one direction or the other ) . Both cases essentially leave the child with an option that is only properly resolved by appealing to sortal-relative criteria . It is worth noting that some cases of change-minimizing conflict correspond to , and in a way explain , a feature of our ordinary identity criteria which was discussed in the last chapter , viz. that sometimes in tracing an object we will branch off in two different directions under two different sortals . These kinds of cases were described as involving ( strictly ) two objects of different sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off all of a tree 's branches so that all that is left of it is its trunk , then , as we saw , in a sense the tree and the trunk are now one , but in a strict sense they are not since they have different histories , the tree having once been larger and the trunk never having been larger than it is . If we trace the trunk-tree backwards in time in order to determine its past we reach a conflict point where we  | can trace along different paths in order to preserve different stabilities . These different paths in fact correspond to tracing under the sortal " trunk " and tracing under the sortal " tree . " Tracing under the first sortal ( i.e. , determining the history of the trunk ) allows us to preserve stability of size , whereas tracing under the second sortal ( i.e. , determining the history of the tree ) allows us to preserve , roughly , boundary sharpness ( i.e. , the tree , as compared with the trunk , always has a boundary which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last case our sortal-relative criteria resolve the conflict in a compromise fashion , by allowing us to trace both paths under different sortals . In other ( perhaps in most ) cases ( e.g. , the case of painting the table and the cases of attaching the bumpers or the sled to the car ) the sortal criteria resolve the conflict by choosing one path and discarding the other . But the basic rule would leave us essentially stranded in all of these cases . And that , I suggest , is the primary reason why we ultimately need the sortal criteria properly to fill out our identity conception . What we have seen in the few cases examined , and could see in any number of other cases , is that the sortal rule enables us to trace objects through those junctures at which the basic rule is helplessly vague . My view is that the sortal rule is in essence nothing more than a clarification , a refinement , of the basic rule . The excessively vague idea of tracing a continuous path that minimizes change now gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path under a sortal concept . But these two ideas are not logically independent . When we trace under a sortal we are ordinarily tracing a path which incontrovertibly minimizes change ; and even when we allow the sortal to guide us through points of change-minimizing conflict we nevertheless continue to trace a path which minimizes change in a certain respect ( i.e. , in respect of satisfying the sortal concept ) . The sortal , we might say , orients us toward an object in terms of a specific viewpoint that clarifies for that object which stabilities count , and which do not , in minimizing change . IV . Refining the Basic Rule I remarked a moment ago that in many cases the sortal rule resolves change-minimizing conflict by choosing one path and dis-  | carding the other . Now this assessment seems evidently correct at least if we limit ourselves to tracing under such standard and relatively unquestionable sortals as " table " and " car . " But it might be suggested that the situation would be considerably altered , in the direction of possibly expanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into play such marginal or borderline sortals as " patch of red . " For we might then construe the basic rule as implying that in cases of change-minimizing conflict we are allowed to trace paths in both directions , and associate with these paths ( strictly ) different objects that temporarily occupy the same place . And if we are sufficiently permissive in counting terms as sortals might it not turn out that the basic rule , thus construed , yields judgments that conform even in many cases of change-minimizing conflict with our sortal-relative judgments ? It will be instructive to examine the implications of this suggestion . if we interpret the basic rule in the manner just suggested then in the case of painting the black table red we would be allowed to trace both a path which preserves size and shape and a path which preserves color . The first of these corresponds to tracing an object under the standard sortal " table " and the second , it is now being suggested , might be said to correspond to tracing an object under the borderline sortal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic rule is working well . In the case of adding bumpers to the car the basic rule , as now construed , would allow us to trace both a path which preserves size and shape and a path which preserves separate movability . The second of these corresponds , we know , to tracing under the standard sortal " car . " Can we find some sortal , even a marginal one , which would allow us , in terms of the sortal rule , to trace the first path ? This is not easy to answer . Possibly the term " portion of a car other than the bumpers " might qualify . If we did treat this term as a sortal then we could say that when we add bumpers to a car some persisting object , viz , the portion of the car other than the bumpers , maintains its size and shape while being sandwiched in between the bumpers . It must be noted ( and this is a point to which I will return in the next chapter ) that if we do treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sortal , then we have to be prepared to allow that the " object " which we trace under this term can  | retain its identity while altering its material composition . ( We would have to distinguish , then , between that portion of the car and the matter which , at a given moment , makes it up . ) Suppose , for example , that after you add the bumpers to the car you also add a door that was missing . If you trace an object under " portion of a car other than the bumpers " you would have to say that this object ( in contrast with the car ) did not gain any parts when the bumpers were added to the car , but that ( like the car ) it did gain a part when the door was added . This sounds very dubious , but is perhaps not entirely out of the question . In general it seems difficult to evaluate the possible sortalhood of various constructions involving words like " portion " and " part . " Consider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " corner ( portion ) of a table , " " top ( part ) of a tree , " " thin part of a piece of clay . " If we do trace persisting items under such terms we are certainly not intuitively inclined to think of these items as persisting objects , perhaps because their identities depend too blatantly on their relations to the objects of which they are parts . Some of these items we are inclined to treat as places on objects , especially those whose identities depend on where they are located in objects ( e.g. , the top of a tree is a place on the tree ) . But the logic and status of these constructions out of " portion " and " part " would have to be examined more closely than I can now undertake . If " portion of a car other than the bumpers " is allowed as a marginal sortal we might go on to consider whether we can find marginal sortals to cover the various other paths which showed up in change-minimizing conflict ( e.g. , the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that direction , however , I want to explain the decisive and important reason why this attempt to enhance the scope of the basic rule is unsuccessful . Imagine now the following variation of the case of painting the table . On Monday you have a wholly red table . On Tuesday you paint half of it black . Then on Wednesday you change your mind and repaint it all red . And then , finally , on Thursday you change your mind again and paint it half black . Consider the following statements :  | ( a ) Throughout these operations , some object maintained a constant size from Monday through Thursday . ( b ) Throughout these operations some object got smaller on Tuesday , and then it got larger on Wednesday , and then it got smaller on Thursday . ( c ) Throughout these operations some object got smaller on Tuesday , and then it got larger on Wednesday , and then it maintained a constant size on Thursday . ( a ) is the standardly correct description of what happened to the table . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginally correct description of what happened to the patch of red . But ( c ) is very definitely not a correct description of any object of any sort whatever . If , however , we construed the basic rule as allowing us to trace both paths in any change-minimizing conflict ( c ) would be a correct description . For there would then be nothing to prevent us from resolving our conflict on Tuesday by choosing the path which stabilizes color , and then resolving our conflict on Thursday by choosing the path which stabilizes size . The reason why we can not do this is decisively beyond the scope of the basic rule . The only way that we might try to emend the rule to deal with this point is to assume that we have initially specified some relatively clear list of distinguishable properties , and the rule tells us that when we trace a given object 's career we must consistently resolve change-minimizing conflict for that object by stabilizing the object with respect to some particular one of those properties ( and that we are not allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tracing that object 's career ) . But that is in all essentials the sortal rule . For the essence of the sortal rule , and its definitive refinement of the basic rule , is that we associate with any object some specifiable sortal-property under which its career is consistently traced . Hence this effort to force a more accurate fit between the basic rule and our ordinary identity judgments in effect transforms the basic rule into the sortal rule . Insofar as the basic rule is allowed to retain its elementary sortal-neutral character we must conceive of it as not containing anything so elaborate as a specifiable list of properties  | under some one of which any object must be consistently traced . In whatever way we might then try to conceive of the rule 's application to change-minimizing conflict ( either as requiring us to choose one path or as allowing us to trace both paths ) the rule surely can not provide a reasonably accurate account of our ordinary judgments in such cases . The primary disparity between the sortal rule and the basic rule , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change-minimizing conflict . This disparity , however , carries with it the derivative and somewhat more obvious one discussed earlier . The sortal rule implies that an object goes out of existence at the moment when we can no longer apply to it the sortal under which its whole career is traced . We can , admittedly , shift from one phase ( restricted ) sortal to another ( e.g. , from " red car " to " green car " ) as an object passes through different phases , but the object 's whole career , from beginning to end , must be traced under one substance ( unrestricted ) sortal ( e.g. , " car " ) , and the moment this sortal can no longer be applied the object 's career must be extended no further . But this , as we noted earlier , can easily happen in such a way that , from the point of view of the basic rule , there is no reason at all to judge that the object has gone out of existence . If a car , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but suffers no discontinuous breakage in the process , then the basic rule would have us say that it still exists in a different form , whereas the sortal rule forces us to say that , if it is no longer a car , it no longer exists . The sortal rule is the operative one , but we can still quite definitely sense in such a case the latent pull of the basic conception . For one thing , people ( philosophers not excluded ) are simply not that quick to admit ( if they ever do ) that the car has to go out of existence just because it ceases to be a car . Furthermore we feel distinctly inclined in cases like that of the crushed car to stretch the sortal as far as possible to keep our identity judgment in line with the basic conception . ( " Well , it 's still a car in some sense . " ) Eventually though , despite the understandably opposite inclination , I think we must yield to the pressure of the operative sortal criteria and say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car no longer exists . A tendency to avoid in discussing these matters is that of im-  | plying that the central role of our sortal criteria is precisely this , to have us judge that an object ceases to exist when it ceases to be the same sort . This makes it sound as if the sortal rule strikes like an arbitrary bolt from above to drive objects to an early doom . That an object ceases to exist at all is only a depressing corollary of the logical conditions of its persistence through change . And the central role of our sortal criteria is to clarify and complete those conditions , which are only vaguely and partially given by the basic rule . A somewhat earlier demise is only the necessary price which an object sometimes pays for having enjoyed a logically more refined mode of persistence . The upshot of this discussion is that while the sortal rule provides a relatively more accurate account of our fully developed identity concept , it is the basic rule which ought to be seen as providing our most fundamental standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interplay between the two rules does not , perhaps , imply any rigid consequences , but does suggest certain general tendencies , which are readily apparent in our language . It suggests , for one thing , a general restriction on the range of concepts which are apt to figure as sortals . In order for a concept to be apt for sortalhood it must be , as we already know , nondispersive. ? But it must also be such that when we typically trace a continuous path under it we are tracing a path which , at least from some intelligible viewpoint , minimizes nonlocational changes . This is why the introduction into our language of a sortal like " incar " ( or , even worse , a sortal like " tree that is being rained upon or trunk that is not being rained upon " ) would be , if not outright incoherent , at least conceptually jarring in the extreme . The reason is that a shrinking path traced under " incar " fails to minimize nonlocational change in any respect which seems remotely conceivable . Terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a table , " which include a locational element , may perhaps qualify as exceptions to this general tendency , though , as noted earlier , such terms are at best marginal sortals , and the items traced under them are not naturally regarded as proper objects . Another general tendency implied by the latent presence of the 6 . Cf. above , p. 4off.  | basic rule is the logical pressure , mentioned earlier , for us to keep our sortal-level judgments about " going out of existence " more or less in line with the basic-level ones . It certainly strikes us as being a rather fundamental feature of our conceptual scheme to think of objects as persisting through far and away the large majority of changes that they can suffer .. Our language does not proliferate highly specific substance sortals in a manner which would force us to judge objects to go out of existence whenever they change slightly . This is why even if someone has no idea what sortal applies to an object he can , for the most part , confidently trace it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces a path which unambiguously minimizes change he need not be overly concerned with the merely remote possibility that what he identifies as a persisting thing has , according to the operative sortal criteria , gone out of existence and been replaced by something else . In explaining that the basic rule is fundamentally limited with respect to cases of change-minimizing conflict , I have in effect been suggesting two rather different kinds of points . The clearest sense in which the rule is limited is that it can not be made to coincide exactly with our actual identity judgments . But the rule seems also limited in the sense that if we did actually base our identity judgments on it , these judgments would be considerably more vague and unwieldy than the judgments that we actually base on the sortal rule . This is because the basic rule , even when buttressed with additional provisos , must remain relatively problematical in its application to cases of change-minimizing conflict . Now such cases may be in one sense rare , since they perhaps occur in only a small proportion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider the small proportion of times in a car 's total duration that the car is painted , or a sled is attached to it , or a bumper is changed , or anything else happens which might plausibly be regarded as giving rise to change-minimizing conflict . ) In another sense , however , such cases are common , since they occur repeatedly and regularly . If we tried to rely entirely on the basic rule these cases would regularly infect our thought and communication about the identity of objects with a far greater degree of obscurity and indefiniteness than our ordinary identity criteria tolerate .  | V. Unity through Time and Space In developing the several foregoing analyses of persistence I was always imagining a situation in which an object has already been picked out at a given moment , and what we wanted was an explanation of the identity rule in terms of which the object 's career is traced through time . But another question that we might ask is what the rule is for picking out objects at a given moment . When does an aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment count as a unitary object ? This is a question about an object 's unity through space which might be seen as paralleling , at least to an extent , the question about unity through time which has so far concerned us . The question about spatial unity naturally leads to distinguishing several senses of " ( physical ) object " ( " body , " " thing , " " entity " ) . There may possibly be a completely permissive sense of the word " object " which applies in fact to any aggregate of matter , however spatially discontinuous , and our question about the nature of an object 's spatial unity would evidently not arise with respect to this sense ( if there is such a sense ) . A criterion of spatial unity first comes into play with respect to the less permissive , but still very broad , sense of " object " that applies to any continuous portion ( mass , bit ) of matter . Hence : ( i ) An aggregate of matter constitutes a single object , in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , if and only if the aggregate is spatially continuous . ( I ) explains how the parts of an aggregate or collection of matter must hang together in order to comprise a single object , in one sense of that word . If we assume the geometrical notion of a continuous curve we can define spatial continuity as follows : x is spatially continuous if and only if any two parts of x can be connected by a continuous curve every point of which touches x . A somewhat simpler definition to the same effect is : x is spatially continuous if and only if x is not exhaustively comprised of two parts that neither touch nor overlap each other . I am inclined to think that the broad sense of " object " defined by ( i ) deserves to be called an ordinary sense of that word . On the other hand there is no doubt that the word is standardly  | employed in a considerably narrower sense . Imagine that a child sees two socks tied together and asks , " What is that thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing him that " it is really two things , and not one thing . " The way to understand this , perhaps , is that though the two connected socks do constitute one thing in a sense ( i.e. , in the sense of ( I ) ) , they do not constitute one thing in the sense which allows for an answer to the question " What is that thing ? " since to answer this question ordinarily involves telling what sortal applies to the thing . We might say , therefore , that the socks do not constitute a standard object , where this notion is explained as follows : ( 2 ) An aggregate of matter constitutes a single object , in the standard sense of the word , if and only if the aggregate is spatially continuous , and some sortal applies to it . I want to understand ( 2 ) in such a way that something is a standard object only if some relatively clearcut sortal applies to it . Hence cars , tables , and trees are standard objects , as are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow such things as pools of water and splinters of wood . But I would not count something as a standard object just because of the application of some such highly questionable sortal as " patch of brown " or " portion of car between the bumpers . " That some reidentifiable aggregates of matter may not be standard objects ( may not have any sortals apply to them ) forebodes a difficulty , viz. if no sortals apply to them how are their careers traced under the sortal rule ? I shall return to this question in the next chapter . It might now occur to someone to suggest that given the concept of a standard object the simple continuity analysis can be resurrected as at least an approximately correct analysis . That analysis stated that any continuous succession of object-stages corresponds to the career of a single object . We know that this is completely wrong if we take " object " in the broad sense which applies to any spatially continuous portion of matter . On the other hand it may seem approximately correct to say that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard objects ) corresponds to the career of a single standard object . Apart from the special case of one object turning into another , exceptions to this principle may be fairly rare , e.g. , in  | the case of a tree with one small branch where an aberrantly continuous succession can be traced combining stages of the tree , which is one standard object , with stages of the trunk , which is another standard object . But this suggestion does not really show that the simple continuity analysis can give us any independent insight into the concept of object-identity . For the idea of a standard object must be explained ( as in ( 2 ) ) in terms of the idea of a sortal . Consequently the simple continuity analysis , insofar as it aspires to operate independently of the idea of a sortal , can not avail itself of the idea of a standard object . It can only be understood as making the drastically mistaken claim that , in the broad sense of " object , " any continuous succession of object-stages corresponds to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be a sense of the word " object " even narrower than " standard object . " We may be inclined to say that the trunk of a tree , and even perhaps the attached bumper of a car , are in some sense not ( whole ) objects but " merely parts of objects . " Here we seem to be using " ( whole ) object " to mean something like " standard object that is not part of any standard object . " I want to turn now to a consideration of various similarities and differences between the unity through time of a standard object and its unity through space . Both modes of unity seem to involve ( a ) an element of continuity , and ( b ) an element of sortal-coverage . The temporal unity of a standard object , as explained by the sortal rule , is constituted by spatiotemporal and qualitative continuity under a single sortal . And the spatial unity of a standard object , as explained by ( 2 ) , might be said to consist in spatial continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye is that , given what I just said , there seems to be nothing corresponding to qualitative continuity in the case of an object 's unity through space . Now this point is actually quite tricky since it is by no means clear what could be the spatial analogue of qualitative continuity ( i.e. , continuity of qualitative change ) . Instead of trying to work this analogy out I will simply make a few observations about an object 's qualitative makeup . Certainly an object need not be homogeneous with respect to such qualities as color or texture . The cushion of a chair may  | be soft and white while the legs of the chair are hard and black . Nor does such qualitative heterogeneity require that some portion of the chair exemplify qualitative states intermediate between the contrasting ones , in the sense in which grey is intermediate between white and black . It may , of course , be that no portion of the chair is semi-hard or grey . But notice , and here is one tricky point , that obviously many portions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be partly hard and partly not hard , and partly black and partly not black . ( So perhaps we would have , as a necessary corollary of spatial continuity , something analogous to qualitative continuity . ) The possible disanalogies between the continuity elements of the definitions of temporal and spatial unity concern me less than the fundamental difference in the sense in which these two modes of unity involve sortal-coverage . The role played by sortals in a standard object 's unity through time turns out , when one considers it carefully , to be quite different from the role played by sortals in a standard object 's unity through space . ( 2 ) says that a continuous aggregate x constitutes a single standard object if some sortal applies to x . But the sortal rule does not say that a continuous succession S corresponds to a career if some sortal applies to S as a whole . Rather the rule imposes a condition on all of the object-stages in S , viz. that they must all be F-stages , for some sortal F. Now an object-stage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the spatial analogue of an objectstage would evidently be a ( spatial ) part of an object . The sortal rule says that , where F is a sortal , any continuous succession of F-stages ( i.e. , any continuous succession each of whose members is a stage of some F-thing or other ) constitutes stages of a single persisting F-thing . The proper spatial analogue of this claim would have to be something like : ( 3 ) Where F is a sortal , any spatially continuous set of F-parts ( i.e. , any spatially continuous set each of whose members is a part of some F-thing or other ) constitutes parts of a single F-thing. ( 3 ) , however , is clearly false . Consider , for example , what ( 3 ) implies if we take " car " as the sortal F : " Any spatially continuous set of car-parts constitutes parts of a single car . " This is false since the set in question might contain the parts of two  | cars that touch each other ( or that are even attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatially continuous , and each of its members would be part of a car , but the set would certainly not constitute parts of any single car . The reason why ( 3 ) is false is that the spatial analogue of the principle of prolongation does not generally hold . The principle of prolongation said that , where F is a sortal , one F-thing can not go out of existence just to be replaced , without any loss of spatiotemporal or qualitative continuity , by another F-thing . The spatial analogue to this ( if we may ignore qualitative factors ) is the false principle that one F-thing can not spatially begin where another F-thing ends off . But certainly one car can begin where another car ends off . In general where F is a sortal , two F-things might certainly touch each other . ( 3 ) implies that this can never happen ( or , more strictly , that if it does happen then the two F-things would have to be parts of some single F-thing ) . There may perhaps be certain special sortals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does hold . It may be , for example , that if two pools of water come into contact they necessarily form a single pool of water . But the principle certainly does not hold with respect to most sortals . The reason why the principle fails for most sortals is fairly obvious . A typical sortal F is associated with the idea of a certain kind of size , or a certain kind of shape , or a certain kind of internal makeup which an object must exemplify in order to qualify as an F-thing . There is therefore no reason to suppose that when two F-things are brought into contact they will add up to something which has that kind of size or shape or makeup . On the other hand there seems typically to be no temporal analogue of size or shape or makeup which is conceptually required of the career of an F-thing , at least none such as to allow us to think of one F-thing being continuously replaced by another F-thing . This difference between a standard object 's temporal unity and its spatial unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " The temporal parts of an enduring thing would have been a perfectly good thing of that kind if they had existed on their own , without the other phases which in fact preceded and followed them , while this is very seldom true in the analogous spatial case : the spatial parts of a thing , conceived  | as existing in spatial disconnection from each other , are not things of the same kind . " 7 Let me try to clarify Quinton 's point by reformulating it in slightly different terms . To begin with , I will use the expression " part of an F-thing " ( e.g. , " part of a car " ) in such a way as to apply also to a whole F-thing ( so that , e.g. , a whole car is part of a car ) . And , similarly , I will use the expression " stage in the career of an F-thing " ( e.g. , " stage in the career of a car " ) to apply also to the whole career of an F-thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car is a stage in the career of a car ) . Now where p is part of an F-thing ( at a given moment ) I will say that p is an intrinsic F-part ( at that moment ) if what qualifies p as part of an F-thing does not depend upon p 's relationship to other F-parts outside it . A whole car is an intrinsic car-part because what qualifies it as a car ( and hence as a car-part ) does not depend upon its relationships to car-parts outside of it ( though it would depend upon its part-whole relationships to car-parts inside it ) . Similarly , where s is a stage in the career of an F-thing s is an intrinsic F-stage if what qualifies s as a stage in the career of an F-thing does not depend upon s 's relationships to F-stages at earlier and later times . The contrast between an object 's spatial unity and temporal unity might now be expressed by saying that whereas typically a part of an F-thing will not be an intrinsic F-part , typically a stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F-stage . This contrast is perhaps best regarded as one of degree . Certainly many large parts of an F-thing will qualify as intrinsic F-parts . The portion of a car between the bumpers , for example , is certainly an intrinsic car-part , since this portion would constitute a car-part no matter how it was related to other car-parts outside it . ( If it were spatially disconnected from any car-parts outside it , it would qualify as a whole car , and hence as a carpart . ) On the other side it seems not entirely clear that every stage in the career of an F-thing will be an intrinsic F-stage . It would seem at least arguable that in some cases an F-stage qualifies as an F-stage only because it is suitably connected to F-stages at other times . Indeed this point seems trivially correct if we 7 . Quinton , The Nature of Things , p. 77 . Compare with Whitehead 's notion of a " uniform object " in The Concept of Nature ( Cambridge University Press , London , 192o ) , p. 162.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the process of moving from New York to California . " Taking " H " as the abbreviation for this sortal , it seems clear that some hour long H-stage qualifies as an H-stage only insofar as it is suitably related to earlier and later H-stages . Even if we focus entirely on high-level substance sortals like " car " and " tree , " which is the more important case , it is perhaps still possible to maintain that the application of such a sortal to an object may depend in part on the object 's behaving in certain ways distinctive of that sort of thing ( or , perhaps more plausibly , on the object 's not behaving in ways incompatible with that sort of thing ) , so that to qualify under the sortal an object-stage might have to be suitably related to other object-stages in such a manner as to add up to the required form of ( non- ) behavior . On the other hand it seems quite unclear to what extent such criteria of behavior are absolutely essential to the application of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate , that the application of a typical substance sortal depends for the most part on features of an object ( indeed on " features " in something like Strawson 's sense ) 8 which could in principle be exemplified by an object in any duration no matter how short . It would seem therefore no great distortion to say that , for a typical substance sortal F , an F-stage of even minute duration can more or less qualify as an F-stage ( can qualify at least as a prima facie F-stage ) quite independently of its relationships to earlier and later Fstages . The contrast that we then have is this . Where F is a typical substance sortal , the only parts of an F-thing which can qualify as intrinsic F-parts are those which are relatively large as compared to the ( whole ) F-things of which they are parts . In contrast , many intrinsic F-stages will be of relatively short durations as compared to the ( whole ) careers of which they are stages ; and there seems indeed to be no definite lower limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object-stage of relatively minute duration might plausibly be regarded as ( more or less ) intrinsically qualifying as an F-stage , quite independently of its relationships to earlier and later F-stages , seems rather essential to the whole enterprise of 8 . P. F. Strawson , Individuals ( Methuen &; Co . Ltd. , London , 1959 ) , p. 202ff.  | the sortal analysis . Surely the underlying point of that analysis is that we can regard the concept of the unity through time of an F-thing as in principle constructible out of the concept of the interconnections between momentary F-stages , i.e. , F-stages which do not themselves depend upon any principle of unity through time . But the analysis would seem rather blatantly circular if the momentary F-stages in terms of which it is couched could not be regarded as essentially intrinsic F-stages , for then these F-stages would qualify as such only in virtue of their standing to each other in just the unity-making relationship which the analysis is supposed to explain . The analysis does in fact seem illuminating because we apparently can regard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interconnections between momentary intrinsic F-stages , in terms , that is , of the interconnections between intrinsic F-stages that are , if not literally instantaneous , at least so brief that their durations can plausibly be disregarded-within the context of the analysis . We saw before ( vis-a-vis the falsity of ( 3 ) ) that there is no general formula , analogous to the sortal rule , which would express the unity through space of an F-thing ( for some typical sortal F ) in terms of the continuity connections between F-parts . An additional point which has now emerged is this . Even if we could somehow express the unity through space of an F-thing in terms of the idea of some more complicated connections between Fparts ( e.g. , in terms of the overlap relations between F-parts ) such an exercise would be quite unilluminating as an explanation of an F-thing 's unity through space . Since relatively minute Fparts will generally not qualify as intrinsic F-parts any reference to minute F-parts as such would already presuppose that those parts stand to each other in just the spatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , the explanation took the form of merely expressing the unity through space of an F-thing in terms of the interconnections between relatively large intrinsic F-parts , the question would remain glaringly left over as to what the unity through space of a large intrinsic F-part consists in . It therefore seems quite hopeless to seek a general sortal-relative analysis , modelled on the sortal rule , of a standard object 's unity through space in terms of how its parts are interconnected . Here we seem to be left with saying ( as in ( 2 ) ) that we have a unified standard object wherever  | we have , for some sortal F , a unified F-thing , i.e. , wherever we have a unified table , or a unified tree , or a unified car , etc. , etc . Of course we might then go on and try to give an analysis , on a case-by-case basis , of what the spatial unity of a table consists in , of a tree , of a car , etc. , etc . VI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise about the similarities and differences between the spatial and temporal unity of a standard object . In the case of temporal unity we have in the form of the basic rule an elementary sortal-neutral conception which approximates at least fairly well to our full-blown conception . Is there something comparable for the case of spatial unity ? Can we also provide an approximately correct general account of when an aggregate of matter constitutes a standard object , without presupposing the notion of a sortal ? That any such account is likely to be not a very close approximation may seem pretty clear at the start . We imagined before that a child might want to treat a pair of socks that are knotted together as a unitary object . It seems unlikely that , without relying on the notion of sortal coverage , we could formulate any general rule which would exclude such a case , and many others like it . On the other hand the general consideration which initially led us to search for the basic rule , as a sortal-neutral account of unity through time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of spatial unity as well . Perhaps any continuous portion of matter is a unitary object in some very broad sense , and could reasonably be treated as such in some suitable circumstance ( i.e. , could be picked out and described as having a shape , size , location , duration , etc . ) . But it seems certain that anyone , regardless of his sortal ignorance , would be far more likely to treat some portions of matter as units than others . Moreover we would expect that the portions of matter which are especially apt to be treated as units in sortal ignorance would coincide at least roughly to those which we treat as standard ( sortal-covered ) objects . So it appears that there is some sortal-neutral principle of unit-selection which approximates in some rough manner to our fully developed concept of the spatial unity of a standard object .  | This point can be illustrated by reference to the example we once considered in which a child who does not have the sortal concept " car " observes a car moving across a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pick the car out as a unitary object . We would certainly not , however , imagine that he would pick out some arbitrary portion of the car as an object . If the car is anything like ordinary looking , he could not be imagined to pick out the front and back halves of the car as units ( and to judge , " Two objects of roughly equal size and shape and color are attached to each other and moving across the field " ) . It seems , intuitively , that the car stands out from its surroundings in a way that its front and back halves do not , and this is why the car , rather than either of its halves , is likely to be picked out as a unitary object even by someone who can not apply any relevant sortals . The car , I will say , is articulated in a way ( or to a degree ) that its front and back halves are not . Articulation , as I want to try to understand this , is an elementary sortal-neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes for articulation we may have at least some rough sortal-neutral approximation to our concept of a standard object 's unity through space . The notion of articulation is closely related to a view that has been developed by a number of psychologists , for example , Kohler and Koffka.9 According to these theorists our sensory fields tend " naturally " and " spontaneously " to be broken down ( articulated ) into unitary objects in accordance with certain general principles of " sensory organization . " ( These principles are also alleged to explain why we tend to see objects as forming distinctive kinds of groups or clusters , but this part of the theory is not directly relevant . ) From my present point of view the only sense in which these principles of articulation ( as I would call them ) need to be regarded as " natural " or " spontaneous " is that they can operate at a relatively elementary level of knowledge , and particularly at a level of sortal ignorance . What seems completely plausible intuitively , and is perhaps also confirmed by experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , anyone who speaks our kind of language ) will tend , even 9 . Wolfgang Kohler , Gestalt Psychology ( Liveright Publishing Corporation , N.Y. , 1947 ) , chaps . 5 ? 6 ; K. Koffka , Principles of Gestalt Psychology ( Harcourt , Brace &; World , Inc. , N.Y. , 1935 ) , chaps . 3 ? 7.  | in a state of sortal ignorance , to see as unitary objects only a select few continuous portions of matter , of the unlimited number potentially present to him . Why this is so ( whether it is " learned " or " innate " ) may at present be left open . I should emphasize that what I call a " state of sortal ignorance " in no way implies a lack of general concepts ( e.g. , of color , shape , size ) . I am certainly not referring to a " preconceptual level , " if such an idea makes sense . Someone is in a state of sortal ignorance with respect to a given object so long as none of the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can apply to the object have the special status of sortalhood , as this status was earlier characterized . ( Roughly this would mean that he can apply no ordinary nouns to the object , other than such nonsortals as " object , " " body , " " thing . " ) What seems intuitively plausible , I am suggesting , is that someone 's sortal ignorance with respect to a given object will typically not prevent the object from presenting itself as an articulated unity , as something that stands out from its surroundings . Articulation is actually a large and intricate topic in its own right , and I will confine myself here to the barest intuitive sketch , drawing in part from Kohler and Koffka . Some of my remarks in this section may be rather speculative , and of a psychological nature . At the very end of the section , however , I will draw certain philosophical conclusions which seem fairly straightforward . A leading articulation-making factor is boundary contrast . A portion of matter seems to impress itself upon us as a unit insofar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding . This segregation is accomplished primarily by the fact that there is a qualitative contrast between points on the object 's surface and points in the surrounding medium . We might consider as a maximally articulated object a black billiard ball rolling across a green felt table . Every point on the ball 's surface contrasts dramatically with either the air around it or the felt beneath it . Boundary contrast , it should be noted , is a matter of degree , as will be the case with every other articulation-making factor . The ball contrasts sharply with its surroundings , both visually and tactually , whereas in other cases the contrast may be less sharp , or in only one modality . The factor of boundary contrast is sufficient to explain why the car stands out in a way that its halves do not , since the halves have no contrast at the boundary where they meet .  | The qualitative homogeneity of the surface of the billiard ball strikes us as enhancing its presence as a unit . Perhaps this is because homogeneity of surface highlights boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without contrast amounts to nothing in the way of articulation , as is evidenced by arbitrary portions of the billiard ball , which are as homogeneous as the whole ball but not therefore articulated . Homogeneity , it will easily be seen , is a matter of degree , and many objects may have relatively little of it . An object seems evidently to stand out more dramatically if it is observed to move as a unit , i.e. , to move together with its parts but not together with anything else in its immediate vicinity . Even if an object is stationary its articulation is seemingly enhanced insofar as we can think of it as tending readily ( which is a matter of degree ) to move as a unit . Hence I will call this articulation-making factor separate movability . A closely related factor is dynamic cohesiveness , which is the object 's capacity ( again a matter of degree ) to hang together when subjected to various strains . This factor seems intuitively important . Someone in a state of relevant sortal ignorance might be initially inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored ashtray that rests on it , but this inclination would probably be dispelled as soon as he discovered how easily the ashtray separates from the table . Perhaps dynamic cohesiveness ought to be regarded as a necessary condition for separate movability , but certainly not conversely . A tree has virtually no movability but it is highly cohesive . Kohler and Koffka mention as another articulation-making factor regularity ( or simplicity or symmetry ) of shape . This condition is not very easy to define or to assess . A possible example of its application is the fact that some trunks of trees ( e.g. , trunks of evergreens ) seem to stand out rather prominently , perhaps because their cylindrical shapes are in some sense simple . There is one other rather obscure articulation-making factor that I want to indicate , but not attempt to define . Certainly a whole branch of a tree stands out as a unit much more than some arbitrary portion of it , e.g. , its outer half . But why is this ? Both the whole branch and its outer half enjoy boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk and where the outer half meets the inner half . And with respect to  | every other articulation-making factor they are evidently the same . Why then the drastic difference in their articulation ? Intuitively the answer has something to do with the fact that where the whole branch touches the trunk there is a joint , whereas there is no joint , but rather a smooth continuation , where the front half of the branch meets the back half . To explain properly what this means would , if I am not mistaken , require a quite elaborate account . I will limit myself here merely to naming this articulation-making factor . I will say that the whole branch forms a joint where it lacks boundary contrast , whereas half the branch does not form a joint where it lacks boundary contrast . The articulation-making factors that I have mentioned are : ( a ) boundary contrast , ( b ) qualitative homogeneity , ( c ) separate movability , ( d ) dynamic cohesiveness , ( e ) regularity of shape , and ( f ) joint-formation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements ( a ) and ( f ) seem most fundamental , at least in the sense of defining the bare minimal conditions of articulation . It seems reasonable to say that in general an object has virtually no articulation at all unless most of its boundary exhibits some degree of boundary contrast and it forms a joint wherever it completely lacks boundary contrast . Certainly some arbitrary portion of a branch , for example , does not stand out as a unit at all , despite its perhaps being to a high degree homogeneous , cohesive , and of regular shape . Perhaps ( though this is almost certainly something of an oversimplification ) we can regard the two boundary requirements ( i.e. , boundary contrast and joint formation ) as by themselves determining the difference between an ( at least somewhat ) articulated object and a ( wholly ) non-articulated object , and bring in the other articulation-making factors only for the purpose of determining degrees of articulation . Looked at in this way , a rough preliminary sketch of articulation might be summed up in the following two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is articulated ? i.e. , stands out as something apt to be treated as a unit ? insofar as most of its boundary exhibits some degree of boundary contrast and it forms a joint wherever it completely lacks boundary contrast .  | ( 2 ) An articulated object 's degree of articulation is determined by its degree of boundary contrast , qualitative homogeneity , separate movability , dynamic cohesiveness , and regularity of shape . The sought after sortal-neutral approximation to our concept of the unity through space of a standard object might now be expressed in terms of the following principle . The Principle of Articulation . In the vast majority of cases a continuous portion of matter constitutes a unified standard object if and only if it has a relatively high degree of articulation . How much a " relatively high " degree of articulation is can perhaps be roughly indicated by reference to some well-chosen examples which exemplify different combinations of the articulation-making factors . But this too might eventually be worked out more carefully in the context of a fuller treatment of articulation . The principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our concept of the unity through space of a standard object . There are any number of cases in which objects are attached to each other to form a continuous portion of matter which seems sufficiently articulated but is nevertheless not a standard object . The two attached socks is one example . Another possible example that came up earlier is a car-cum-sled , which is not a standard object despite being perhaps as articulated as many ( ill-shaped ) cars . Examples like these could be multiplied indefinitely . Besides such examples of problematically overarticulated nonstandard objects there will also be cases of problematically under-articulated standard objects , most obviously where a standard object suffers a temporary lapse of articulation because of being in some special setting ( e.g. , where a sock is tied to another one just like it ) . On the other hand , I think that the principle of articulation can fairly be regarded as providing an importantly viable sortalneutral perspective on the basic outlines of the standard objects that figure in our identity scheme . The principle at least rules out that vast ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sufficient articulation . These would include , most obviously , arbitrary portions of  | standard objects ( e.g. , half of a table ) , and continuous summations of such portions ( e.g. , half of a table-cum-half of an ashtray ) , which lack the essential boundary requirements , and are therefore not articulated at all . The principle would also rather definitely rule out as insufficiently articulated typical summations of whole standard objects ( e.g. , a table-cum-ashtray ) which , though they satisfy the minimal boundary requirements , are lacking in any high degree of homogeneity , movability , cohesiveness , or shape-regularity . In general the principal of articulation might be said to draw the outlines of our standard objects in exceedingly broad strokes , but these are still recognizably the essential outlines of our standard objects . The overall position which has now emerged is that our most basic conception of the spatial and temporal unity of an object , a conception which is refined and clarified by our sortals , is that of a relatively articulated object whose career unfolds along a continuous change-minimizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of the articulation-making factors had already shown up earlier in the quite different connection of change-minimizing conflict . There were a number of examples in which it seemed intuitively important to stabilize these factors when tracing a change-minimizing path . ( In the case of painting the table it seemed that it might be important to stabilize the table 's separate movability ; in the case of placing the ashtray on the table it seemed that it might be important to stabilize the table 's dynamic cohesiveness ; in the trunk-tree case it seemed that it might be important to stabilize the tree 's sharpness of boundary contrast . ) This suggests the intriguing conjecture that there may possibly be a deeper connection between articulation and the change-minimizing condition , in that there may be some general tendency to resolve change-minimizing conflict by stabilizing articulation-making factors . I shall not here attempt to develop this suggestion , though it may be , I am led to believe , consonant with a number of principles enunciated by psychologists . ' " I stated earlier that for my immediate purposes the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick out objects which satisfy the articulation-making factors or learn to 1o . See Koffka 's comments on Von Schiller 's experiments and Metzger 's experiments , Principles of Gestalt Psychology , pp. 300-303.  | do so . The same question could be raised about our disposition to trace objects along continuous change-minimizing paths . This issue is notoriously difficult to clarify , and many questions converge on it , particularly questions about the relationship between thinking and speaking . My tentative opinion ( in general agreement with that of Kohler and Koffka ) is that there probably is some important sense in which human beings are innately disposed both to pick out articulated objects within their sensory fields and to trace those objects along continuous changeminimizing paths.11 One relatively clearcut consequence of this hypothesis is that there probably never has been , or will be , a natural ( first ) language spoken by humans which contains an identity scheme whose basic structure could not be captured in terms of the principle of articulation for spatial unity , and the rule of change-minimizing continuity for temporal unity . Cultural divergence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinement but the basic structure of human thought about identity is universal . That , at any rate , seems to me a highly plausible hypothesis . But it is , as far as I am concerned , essentially an empirical hypothesis , to be dealt with in an empirically scientific manner . The only a priori philosophical doctrines to which I want to be committed , and for which I have tried to present arguments , are these : ( i ) We can provide a relatively accurate account of our ( English speaker 's ) concept of the unity through time and unity through space of a standard object only by taking cognizance of what sort of object we are dealing with , since sortalcoverage ( though in two rather different senses ) figures in both modes of unity ; ( ii ) However , a significant approximation to this account can be presented without taking cognizance of what sort of object we are dealing with , and this sortal-neutral approximation might be regarded as capturing our most basic conception of an object 's unity through time and space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the unity of a body is something that we are " innately predisposed to appreciate " ( The Roots of Reference , p. 54 ) , and that " body-unifying considerations . . . are rooted in instinct " ( ibid. , p. 55 ) . The innateness question will be considered at length in Chapter 8.  | EARLIER I expressed the opinion that any continuous portion of matter , even one which does not come under any sortal ( and which does not , therefore , constitute a standard object ) , can perhaps be called an " object " in one very broad , ordinary sense of that word . This is certainly a debatable point , and I do not intend to presuppose it in anything that follows . What seems less debatable , however , and more important , is the following proposition . Our ordinary concept of identity through time applies , in at least many typical cases , to portions of matter ( whether or not these be called " objects " ) that do not come under any sortals . And this immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foregoing account , an operative condition for the application of our full-blown identity concept . Suppose , for example , that I specify some portion of wood which partially makes up the uniform wooden table in front of me . I might do this by momentarily laying my hand on the surface of the table and thereafter referring to the hand-shaped portion of wood which had momentarily extended directly downwards beneath my hand . Now that portion of wood is quite definitely not covered by any sortal , since we know that the dispersive term " wood " is not a sortal , l and there is evidently no other possible sortal which applies to the wood . Yet there seems no i . Cf. above , p. 42.  | doubt that ( whether or not we call it an " object " ) we do think of that wood , of the particular portion of wood that was directly under my hand , as having an identity of its own , as being spatially related to other portions of wood that surround it , and as in fact having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has . But what does this concept of persistence mean if it can not be understood in terms of the idea of a sortal-covered path ? It will of course be tempting to suggest that the basic rule can help us here . Can we not perhaps say that with respect to a portion of matter which is not sortal-covered our only relevant concept of persistence is the relatively primitive one provided by change-minimizing considerations ? However , this answer will not work . We can indeed conceive of the basic rule as straightforwardly applicable to non-sortal-covered portions of matter ( to nonstandard " objects " ) wherever these portions of matter are at least to some extent articulated . For example , the portion of matter which constitutes two socks that are tied together could typically be traced along a continuous change-minimizing path . But there is something especially problematical about the sort of case that I am considering in which a wholly non-articulated portion of matter is referred 4o . It would seem that in many ( though perhaps not all ) such cases the change-minimizing condition is thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will often be the case that we could trace continuous paths from the portion in any and all directions , none of which could straightforwardly claim the unique status of minimizing change in any relevant ( i.e. , nonlocational ) respect . This point seems rather clear in the particular case under consideration . Since we are imagining that the hand-shaped portion of wood being referred to is merely a wholly indistinct portion of a larger uniform mass of wood , we can not possibly trace that portion along a change-minimizing path , for there will be an indefinite number of paths extending away from that portion , all of which contain qualitatively indistinguishable handshaped portions of wood . I do not wish to base my argument on the overly problematical ( though possibly defensible ) general principle that the changeminimizing condition can never straightforwardly apply to cases of non-articulated portions of matter . All that I require for my  | present purposes is the limited point that the change-minimizing condition seems quite helpless at least with respect to some cases of non-articulated portions , i.e. , cases like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger uniform mass . It might still be urged , however , that even in the latter cases change-minimizing considerations can work effectively so long as we allow ourselves to take into account the location of a portion of matter within the object that it partially constitutes . Perhaps this should be treated as a special kind of locational consideration , which does in fact count in tracing a career . The suggestion would be , in effect , that we can state identity criteria for the specified hand-shaped portion of wood in terms of its location relative to the outlines of the table . Our concept of the identity of that portion of wood would then be criterially determined by the rule that you are referring to the same wood so long as you are referring to the wood which occupies the same place on the table ( i.e. , the same place relative to the outlines of the table ) . But this is unquestionably wrong , because it is certainly not the case that the same wood can not alter its location on the table . Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it several inches shorter . Certainly this would warrant my now saying , " The hand-shaped portion of wood which was directly under my hand a moment ago was closer to the outlines of the table yesterday than it was a day before yesterday . " And quite apart from anything akin to filing , it must surely be admitted that it is at least conceptually coherent to suppose that my table suffered from some chemical quirk which made some of its wood regularly contract while the rest expanded , in which case possibly that portion of wood which was momentarily under my hand regularly altered its size and its place on the table . No , the location of the wood on the table quite definitely does not criterially define its identity . It seems sufficiently clear , therefore , that the change-minimizing condition will not explain the wood 's identity , even if we allow locational considerations into play . And this leaves us with the puzzle as to what does explain the wood 's identity . Perhaps this puzzle can be made a bit more stark by slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces so that I am left with a large number of wooden fragments . Holding  | one of these fragments in my hand I certainly want to say , " This fragment of wood came out of the table . " Now this is , so far , no problem since we can in principle trace the fragment backwards in time to some portion of the table , tracing , that is , along a change-minimizing path or , if necessary , a path covered by the nondispersive concept " fragment of wood . " There is no problem here because , first , a fragment of wood is articulated , which immediately invites a straightforward application of the changeminimizing condition , and , second , " fragment of wood " can function in a straightforward way as a sortal which covers a tracing path . There is indeed the possible complication that , depending on how the table broke , we might have to say that the fragment is traceable back to some portion of a larger fragment , which is in turn traceable back to some portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . , which is in turn traceable back to some portion of the table . Still , so long as " coming out of " is transitive , there should be no major problem in explaining at least what it means to say that the fragment came out of the table . The problem arises insofar as I also want to say something else , viz. " This wood used to make up part of the table . " ( Not , strictly , " This fragment of wood used to make up part of the table , " since my table was not made up of articulated fragments . ) But what can I possibly mean by this ? What can I mean by saying that this wood was in my table yesterday though it was then merely a wholly indistinct portion of some larger uniform mass ? If I want to talk about that selfsame wood persisting from yesterday to today I should , it seems , have criteria of identity which explain what this means , which explain what the unitymaking relationship is that binds together the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no such criteria of identity , at least none provided by the idea of a change-minimizing or sortal-covered path . Now the very natural first impulse upon hearing this puzzle is to protest that the whole thing is really very obvious . ( It is a philosophically important feature of this puzzle that we find it extremely difficult to take it seriously . ) " Look , that wood that you 're holding in your hand came out of the table , right ? If it 2 . Cf. above , p. 42.  | came out of the table it had to be in the table . Now it certainly did n't jump into the table when we were n't looking . So it 's been in there all the time . " This seems like an outright evasion , for I was not asking for a justification ( for evidence ) but for an analysis ( for criteria ) . I was not asking , " How do we know that the wood persisted before it came out of the table ? " which would imply that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather " What can we mean by speaking of the persistence of the wood before it came out of the table ? " The challenge is to show me the criteria of identity . ( But we will see shortly that this natural response , which apparently ignores the request for criteria , may be in a certain sense quite-apt . ) It is interesting to note that Russell was consistently sensitive to the puzzle about the identity of matter which I am now discussing , even though he formulated it in the context of his previously mentioned inaccurate account of the identity of standard objects . At one point Russell explains that " . . . continuity is not a sufficient criterion of material identity . It is true that in many cases , such as rocks , mountains , tables , chairs , etc. , where the appearances change slowly , continuity is sufficient , but in other cases , such as the parts of an approximately homogeneous fluid , it fails us utterly . We can travel by sensibly continuous gradations from any one drop of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other time . " 3 Russell is wrong ( or misleading ) in stating that continuity is a sufficient condition of identity for standard objects like tables and chairs , since ( as shown in Chapter 1 ) even in such cases continuity considerations by themselves do not exclude aberrant paths which combine stages of a whole with stages of its parts . Yet Russell correctly perceives that there is an important difference between cases involving standard objects like chairs and tables , and cases involving a merely undifferentiated portion of some larger uniform mass , like a drop of water in the sea . The difference , which Russell however never makes explicit , is that considerations of sortal-covered ( or change-minimizing ) continuity suffice for the former cases but not for the latter . A problem about the identity of matter is most immediately g . Russell , " The Relation of Sense-Data to Physics , " p. 171.  | apparent in the sort of case that I considered , or the one that Russell considers , involving a portion of matter which is neither sortal-covered nor articulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule nor the change-minimizing rule . But the problem is actually a more general one , and pertains even to portions of matter that are , at a given moment , both fully articulated and sortal-covered . This is because it is always necessary to distinguish between the identity through time of a portion of matter and the identity through time of the articulated object which , at a given moment , it makes up . Suppose that the portion of wood x composes the whole table y today . Though the table y 's career can be traced along a path covered by the sortal " table " ( or along a change-minimizing path ) , x 's career can not be traced in this manner , since x 's career may not be the same as y 's . If , for example , a piece of wood chipped off the table yesterday then , whereas the table y was larger yesterday , x was the same size but composed only part of the table . ( Hence the relationship between x and y today is only one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even where a portion of wood is covered by the sortal " table " ( in the sense that " table " constitutively applies to it ) , its career can not properly be traced along a sortal-covered ( or change-minimizing ) path . A distinction between the identity of a portion of matter and the identity of the articulated object which it makes up must be acknowledged even in those cases where the only sortal under which we can trace the articulated object that the matter makes up is some term with roughly the force " articulated bit of such and such matter " ( e.g. , " puddle of water , " " fragment of wood " ) . Thus we have to distinguish between the identity of a puddle of water ( fragment of wood ) and the identity of the water ( wood ) which makes it up . This distinction is very obviously required whenever a smaller articulated bit of matter is separated from , or joined to , the larger articulated bit which we are tracing . For example , we would not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse ) of water we are thereby tracing the very same water , since someone may have removed a glass of water from the puddle , or added one . Or if a splinter of wood is separated from a larger fragment ( or lump or chunk ) of wood then ? . Cf. above , p. 59ff.  | of course we no longer have the very same wood . But , to take this point one step further , even where no smaller articulated bit separates from , or joins , the larger articulated bit which we are tracing this still does not give us a criterial guarantee that we are tracing the very same matter . This is perfectly obvious in the case of the puddle of water since we know that water may evaporate out of , or condense into , the puddle . And a moment 's thought should convince us that even in tracing an apparently intact fragment of wood it must always remain a conceptually coherent possibility that some of the wood is vanishing ( changing ) into thin air while some other wood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a way just a big chunk of wood , whose matter is continuously changing . ) So it seems that the idea of a change-minimizing or sortal-covered path gives us no criteria for the concept of the persistence of matter under any circumstances . How then does this concept operate ? An " Ultimate " Kind of Persistence It might be suggested that the appropriate move at this point would be to search diligently for some perhaps complicated and ingenious formulation of our identity criteria for matter ( where these criteria might vary significantly from one sort of stuff to another ) . Before directly addressing this suggestion I want to explain an alternative approach , which is the one that I hold to be correct . My position , to put it somewhat incautiously at first , is that we do not have any identity criteria for matter . But this idea needs to be explained . To begin with , it should be clear that the sort of identity criteria that I have been discussing in this book are observational criteria . We have observational criteria for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria by reference exclusively to conditions of a straightforwardly observable sort . This seems tantamount to saying that observational criteria must not go beyond the ordinary manifest properties of things ( e.g. , something 's being a table or something 's being red ) and the ordinary manifest relations between things ( e.g. , spatial and temporal ) . Now for the case of the persistence of an ordinary articulated object we can draw a fairly clear distinction between criteria of  | identity and evidence of identity . The criteria are those observational considerations in terms of which we can , at least roughly , analyze or define what our concept of the object 's persistence consists in . Identity criteria , on my understanding , may be exceedingly vague and allow for any number of borderline possibilities . But we have criteria of identity for ordinary objects insofar as in the most typical nonborderline cases our judgments of identity about these objects are analytically entailed by straightforwardly observable conditions . These conditions , I have argued , basically amount to the requirement that an object 's career be traceable along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , comprises facts from which we can inductively conclude that the criteria are satisfied . On the basis of directly tracing various objects along change-minimizing or sortal-covered paths we arrive inductively at generalizations ( e.g. , that a table tends , when left alone , to remain qualitatively and locationally stable ) which allow us to judge that the identity criteria were satisfied in those cases where we could not directly observe this . ( So the fact that the table which is present when we return to a room is qualitatively and locationally similar to the one that we saw before leaving provides evidence that probably the criteria of sortal-coverage and continuity were satisfied , and that we have the same table . ) But for the case of the persistence of matter I think we can draw no such distinction between criteria and evidence of identity : here , in a sense , we have only evidence and no criteria . By this I mean that the only way to characterize our general procedure for judging of the identity of matter is to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most coherent and theoretically satisfying account of what we observe . In this way we arrive at various principles which , both at the commonsense level and at scientific levels , specify how bits of matter of various sorts may be presumed to behave under different observable circumstances . ( For example , one such principle might be that , other things being equal , a non-articulated bit of wood is presumed to maintain a constant location within a table . ) But these principles are both partial and provisional , and may , within broad limits , be supplemented or revised in the light of scientific progress . These principles can not therefore provide an analysis or definition of our concept of persisting matter .  | This account implies that our concept of persisting matter , even at the most commonsense level , incorporates something in the way of a theoretical-explanatory posit of an underlying mode of physical persistence which ultimately accounts for the observed behavior of ordinary articulated objects . Even the most limited level of common sense contains an abundance of relatively secure and well-founded views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science to fill in the details . But no belief about the observable manifestations of matter , however well founded , is analytic of our concept of persisting matter . It must always remain a conceptually coherent possibility that our explanations have been faulty and that matter behaves differently from the way that we think . Though I am maintaining that we have no ordinary observational criteria of identity for matter it might still be possible to provide some level of analysis or explanation of our concept of persisting matter . We can , in fact , broadly distinguish between two philosophical ( and scientific ) approaches to such an explanation . a . It might be held that the persistence of matter is ultimately to be understood in terms of the persistence of particles such as atoms , molecules , or electrons . These particles might be said , in a somewhat extended sense , to be articulated by various unobservable properties in terms of which a sortal such as " atom " can be defined . The persistence of an atom is then analyzed in the standard way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sortal " atom . " ( Alternatively we can say that the atom 's path minimizes change with respect to its unobservable properties . ) The persistence of a bit of matter is thus ultimately analyzed in terms of the sortal-covered persistence of the particles which make it up . ( We can then say , if we like , that we have " theoretical identity criteria " for matter since we can give an analysis of the persistence of matter in theoretical terms. ) b . If we want to avoid a commitment to atomism we might say simply that the persistence of matter depends upon some unobservable relationship which binds the successive stages of a single bit of matter . This relationship has sometimes been called " genidentity. " 5 So we can , in a sense , explain the identity 5 . See Rudolph Carnap , Introduction to Symbolic Logic ( Dover Publications , N.Y. , 1958 ) , p. 198 . See also the remarks about genidentity in Hans Reichen-  | of matter by reference to that relationship . ( Though this " explanation " seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from saying that in terms of the unobservable relationship of genidentity we can state " theoretical identity criteria " for matter . ) The ( b ) - approach seems to me on the whole the more sensible one . The ( a ) - approach does admittedly have the advantage of allowing a closer analogy between the persistence of matter and the ordinary sortal-covered persistence of familiar articulated objects . The ( b ) - approach , on the other hand , at least maintains a formal analogy between these two modes of persistence , insofar as in both cases a unity-making relationship ( sortal-covered continuity for ordinary objects and genidentity for matter ) can be thought of as binding object-stages into successions which do not generally crisscross or overlap . And the ( b ) - approach has the decisive-seeming advantage of not forcing us to wed the concept of persisting matter a priori to atomism . ( The ( b ) - approach does not exclude atomism since there is nothing to prevent the relationship of genidentity from turning out to depend upon the sortal-covered persistence of atoms . ) The a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have us reject on a priori ( conceptual ) grounds various anti-atomic theories of matter that have been influentially maintained in the history of science.6 This seems implausibly overbearing . It seems that our concept of the persistence of matter ought to be seen as a priori accommodating the possibility that , even from the deepest theoretical vantage point , portions of matter might persist as merely nondifferentiated parts of larger masses . The contrast that I am trying to develop here between the persistence of standard objects and the persistence of ( portions of ) matter seems the more compelling , certainly , if one agrees with me in rejecting an a priori atomistic analysis of our concept of the persistence of matter . But I think that the point remains essentially intact even if one opts for a priori atomism . There is surely an important sense in which the persistence of such parbach , The Philosophy of Space and Time ( Dover Publications , N.Y. , 1958 ) , p. 270ff. 6 . See the conflict between atomic theories and " continuum " theories as discussed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Harper &; Row , N.Y. , 1962 ) , p. 64ff. and p. 158ff.  | titles as atoms , molecules , and electrons can not be understood in straightforwardly observational terms . Obviously these particles can not be observed except perhaps by way of highly technical and theory-imbedded apparatus . Moreover it would seem that we can not even soberly visualize such particles in terms of ordinary qualities like color or texture . The conclusion seems therefore warranted that if the only account that we can give of our concept of the persistence of matter is in terms either of atomism or genidentity , then our concept of this mode of persistence is not properly regarded as analyzable in terms of ordinary observational identity criteria . There is a philosophical tradition , loosely associated with the word " substance , " to the general effect that our concept of the persistence of matter points to something beyond the reach of what can be straightforwardly observed . ( This is the gist of Descartes 's discussion of the wax in Meditation 2 . ) This seems closely akin to the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitle us , I think , to say something else which is close to the heart of the substance tradition , and this is that the unity through time of matter , in contrast to that of familiar articulated objects , is in a sense ultimate . This sense of ultimacy derives from the two related points that the unity through time of matter goes deeper than ( because it is not analyzable in terms of ) the ordinary manifest properties and relations of things , and this unity is posited as playing a central role in the ideally most complete explanation of physical phenomena. ? III . Searching for Identity Criteria This , then , is my view on the identity of matter . Let me return now to the previously postponed suggestion that perhaps , contrary to my view , there really are observational identity criteria for matter and we ought to look harder for them . I would not expect this suggestion to induce a great deal of enthusiasm at the present stage of the discussion . For we now have before us two possible accounts , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the identity of matter . According 7 . Cf. Shoemaker 's discussion of the connection between the substance tradition and the analyzability of identity judgments , in Self-Knowledge and SelfIdentity , pp. 57 ? 63 and pp. 254 ? 60.  | to the criterial model these judgments are to be seen as analytically entailed by some complex conjunction of straightforwardly observable conditions . The model that I propose denies that any such analytic entailments apply to these judgments . The latter model must seem far more promising than the former in light of the cases considered earlier ( the hand-shaped bit of wood in the table , the fragment of wood , the puddle , the tree ) . For these cases certainly did not make it appear remotely hopeful that we could specify even vaguely some observable conditions which analytically entail the relevant judgments about the identity of matter . To recapitulate brief'y , we recall that the identity of the **26;1010;TOOLONG bit of wood in the table could evidently not be analyzed in terms of any straightforward considerations of sortal-covered or change-minimizing continuity . Nor , we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criterial basis for judging of its identity . And notice now the more general point that our ability conceptually to divide an object like a table top into such parts or portions as the part in the middle , the curved part , that corner , that edge , and so on , will never give us the sought-after criterial basis for the identity of the bits of matter which compose the object , since it is by no means an analytic truth that the same parts , in this sense , must be composed of the same matter . Or , to consider a slightly different sort of case , when a piece of clay is deformed we may be able straightforwardly to observe the differing movements of such parts as , for example , the top part , the middle part , the thin part , the bumpy part . But none of this gives us a criterial basis for judging of the identity of the matter which makes up these parts . This point reverts back to my observation in the preceding chapter that if we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a car between the bumpers " then we must be careful to distinguish between the item thus traced and the matter which , at any given moment , makes it up . I noted then the apparent difficulty in assessing the status as sortals of various constructions out of " part " and " portion , " and the correlative difficulty in assessing the status as objects of the items traced under such constructions . What seems sufficiently clear , however , is that these items , whatever their precise status , can not provide  | us with identity criteria for the bits of matter which partially compose an object . And once this is clear I think it is immediately apparent that there are no remotely plausible candidates for such a criterial basis . The reasonable conclusion seems to be that we simply do not rely on observational criteria when we judge of the identity of some matter which partially composes an object . In a case like that of the wood in the table what we do rely on ( at a commonsense level ) is the simplifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains fairly constant . That is , we rely on some such general simplifying principle as this : Other things being equal the location of a non-articulated bit of matter within an articulated object may be presumed to remain fairly constant . But this principle provides nothing like a criterial guarantee , and there is no saying a priori in how many different ways the principle might have to be augmented and reshaped both by common sense and science . ( There is no saying a priori in how many different ways the " other things being equal " clause would have to be filled in to yield the simplest and most coherent account of the careers of different bits of matter . ) In those various cases where we judge that some non-articulated matter has altered its location within an object ( e.g. , in the case of a piece of clay that is being deformed , or in the case of a tree , or in the case of a river ) we rely on the most diverse evidential considerations and ultimately on the best theory of matter we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler kind of situation , in which the quantity of matter under consideration is fully articulated , we find nothing like a criterial guarantee of our identity judgments about the matter . Suppose , for example , that I am holding a perfectly solid block of wood in my hand , stationary , not squeezing it too hard , in ordinary atmospheric conditions , with nothing observably weird going on ( for example , there are no observable changes in either the size or shape of the block ) . In such circumstances I might venture the following identity judgment : " The wood which now makes up this block is identical with the wood which made up this block a moment ago . " We are searching for some observable conditions which might criterially ( analytically ) entail the truth of this judgment . What needs to be ruled out , among other things , is the possibility that some of the  | wood vanished ( changed ) into air ( or into the flesh of my hand ) and/or that some additional wood materialized out of the air ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What observable conditions could conceivably be such as to entail analytically that this has not happened ? Surely not the conditions mentioned earlier ( that the block was not squeezed , that its size and shape remained constant , etc . ) . It might be startling , but certainly not incoherent , for scientists to tell us that under just those conditions some bit of wood turns into air and vice versa . ( The constancy of the block 's size and shape might be accounted for by positing suitable expansions and contractions of the wood inside the block . ) Is it not clearly hopeless to seek some other observable conditions which somehow would analytically entail the identity judgment ? If someone is not convinced that this is hopeless then let him reflect upon the following point ( which seems to me fairly decisive ) . In order for it to be true to say " The wood which now makes up this block is identical with the wood which made up this block a moment ago " it must be the case that all the original wood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even if some minute and possibly invisible speck of wood in the block turned into air the identity judgment in question is , strictly speaking , false . But it seems obvious beyond the need for further argument that no straightforwardly observable conditions ( no facts about the ordinary properties and relations of things ) , however complex , could analytically guarantee that no such minute speck turned into air . And since the identity judgment requires just this guarantee it follows immediately that no observable conditions can criterially guarantee the identity judgment . Indeed the position that I am here defending seems evident almost to the point of triviality the moment we remind ourselves that the proposition " x ( which exists now ) is the same wood as y ( which existed before ) " entails " Every ( wooden ) part of x , no matter how minute , was a part of y . " This entailment seems immediately to render unobservable the identity through time of matter . And , I might add , one can apparently say this without being committed to any special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - " theoretical " distinction . Whatever might be the ultimate epistemological status of the " straightforwardly observable " it seems sufficiently clear that in the sense  | in which the persistence of a table , or a block of wood , is straightforwardly observable , the persistence of a portion of matter is not , since the latter mode of persistence depends upon the clearly unobservable condition that every minute part of the matter remain the same . We are perhaps inclined to ignore considerations about minute and possibly invisible specks of matter in the context of a discussion of our most commonsense concept of persisting matter . But such considerations , once we are reminded of them , seem quite definitely to have a legitimate bearing on the meaning of that commonsense concept , and indeed to be in a way definitive of it . If someone , say a child , could not appreciate the relevance , with respect to his judgments about " same wood , " of scientific theories about minute and invisible specks of matter , this would seem to be grounds for saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of matter but was instead still at the more elementary level of thinking only about , e.g. , " same block , " " same stick . " Admittedly a commonsense judgment about the identity of some matter is not likely to stickle over details about minute parts . From a commonsense point of view perhaps what I would really want to say about the block of wood is that the wood which makes it up now is more or less the same as before , but not necessarily exactly the same . Be this as it may it would certainly seem a mistake to try to suggest that though we have no observational criteria for the judgment " x ( which exists now ) is the same matter as y ( which existed before ) " we do nevertheless have such criteria for the judgment " Some large portion of x is the same matter as some large portion of y , " or , colloquially , " x is more or less the same matter as y . " Surely our understanding of these latter judgments presupposes our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our understanding of what it means to say of a particular bit of matter that it has persisted over some period of time . And since , by hypothesis , we have no observational criteria in terms of which to analyze or define what is meant by the former judgment it follows that we can not have observational criteria in terms of which to analyze or define what is meant by the latter judgments . The inescapable conclusion seems to be that in judging of the identity of matter , even in those cases where the matter happens  | to be articulated ( e.g. , in judging of the identity of the wood in the block ) , we do not rely on identity criteria , but we rely instead on some such simplifying principle as the following : Other things being equal an intact articulated object ( like an intact block of wood ) may be presumed to alter its material composition , if at all , only partially and very slowly . Common sense and science augment this principle ( fill in the " other things being equal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criterial strictures but on the basis rather of the widest and in principle most unlimited variety of facts about how things alter in size and weight , decompose , mix together , and so on . The proper model here is not that of criteria application but rather that of working towards the , most coherent theory of an underlying level of persisting matter . IV . Matter and Common Sense That our commonsense concept of persisting matter involves the positing of an underlying reality may seem unbelievable because the concept strikes us as absolutely obvious and inevitable . Indeed the premise that the concept is not criterially definable in conjunction with the recognition of its utter obviousness could naturally lead to the surmise that the concept must be in some sense a priori . But I think that a more straightforward explanation of why the concept is so obvious is that our experience with ordinary articulated objects provides us incessantly with a literally overwhelming barrage of evidence that there exists underlying matter . That is , our most immediate and surface-level observations of ordinary objects , whose persistence conditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of facts which point unavoidably to the conclusion that these ordinary objects are composed of , and are ultimately to be understood in terms of , persisting items of a quite different sort . The range of facts to focus on contains as an instance just the sort of case discussed earlier , breaking a table to pieces . What we can not avoid noticing in such a case is that the fragments which emerge from the table go together to add up to an object of at least roughly the size , and even form , of the table . And this is virtually a universal phenomenon : An object which contains no ( observably ) articulated parts is split up into a number of  | objects which add up to the original . How can one avoid trying to explain this by invoking the idea that the smaller objects which came out of the bigger one were in some sense already in there prior to their articulation ? This conclusion seems so inevitable that one could scarcely take seriously my question about our basis for judging that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lurking non-articulatedly in the table . And as far as the question where in the table it was , well , we adopt initially the simplest and most obvious hypothesis that it was always located right at the place in the table from whence it came . Such assumptions as this constitute a rudimentary commonsense theory of underlying matter , and all that is now required is for someone like Thales to enter the scene and the rest happens by itself . But we can , I feel convinced , imagine what it would be like to live in a world whose articulated objects did not display those patterns of behavior which provide the primitive basis for our concept of persisting matter . In such a world the concept would have no use , at least not at a commonsense level . I will only sketch this peremptorily . But imagine that whenever you break a table to pieces the resulting fragments add up to five times the size of the table . Imagine that if ever you start out with a basin full of water and remove a glassful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basin overflows enormously . Imagine that whenever you dig a hole in the ground you wind up with a pile of dirt which looks thirty times higher than the hole next to it . These imaginings would have to be generalized indefinitely before we reached the image of a world in which the concept of persisting matter had no immediate application . But I can see no reason to doubt that we can coherently broach this image . That it is extremely difficult for us to do so shows how deep in our experience the concept of matter penetrates ; but that it is possible for us to do so shows that the concept is not , in the most ultimate sense , unavoidable . If we lived in that imagined world we would still have immediate use for the idea that " you ca n't get something out of nothing , " since to get , for example , a new fragment of wood you would have to make one by separating it out of something else . The idea for which we would have no immediate use is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of another object there was all along some-  | thing , the persisting matter , waiting there to be articulated . This idea ( which is , I think , in some sense really a strange idea ) would not impress itself upon us . The essential simplification which our concept of matter contributes at a commonsense level might be thought of as follows . If we were to confine ourselves wholly to the observational level of the basic ( or sortal ) conception we would be able to formulate the following two kinds of laws . Type A laws would tell us what tends to happen in the special case in which one articulated object is created ( or destroyed ) by coming out of ( or merging into ) another . For example : When an articulated wooden object is broken to pieces the fragments which come out of it add up to the original in size and weight ( and perhaps shape ) . Type B laws would tell us how articulated objects tend to behave in the more general case in which no articulated object is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or merging into ) another . An example might be : Under ordinary conditions an articulated wooden object tends to conserve its size , and weight , and shape . Now it is a contingent fact , which we can imagine otherwise , that these two types of observational laws are so related that they can be subsumed under , and hence explained in terms of , relatively simple type T laws which posit an underlying level of persisting matter . An example of a type T law is : Under ordinary conditions a portion of wood ( whether articulated or not ) tends to conserve its size , and weight , and shape . This type T law allows us to explain in a simple unified manner the two kinds of phenomena which we would have had to treat separately if we limited ourselves to the observational level . The explanatory application of a type T law , which describes the behavior of underlying matter , presupposes the availability of some principles ( " correspondence rules , " " bridge principles " ) that connect observable facts about articulated objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the most rudimentary commonsense theory of matter as embodying such principles in the form of the three presumptive principles which have emerged in the course of this discussion , viz. ( I ) the presumption that the material composition of an articulated object remains pretty much constant , ( 2 ) the presumption that the location of a non-articulated bit of matter within an articulated object remains pretty much constant , and ( 3 ) the presumption  | that when a smaller articulated object comes out of ( merges into ) a larger one then the matter which makes up the smaller one is subtracted from ( added to ) the matter which makes up the larger one . In terms of these three principles we are able to construct a relatively coherent and satisfying picture of what happens to the wood in a table both before and after the table is broken to pieces . We can say that each fragment that comes out of the table is composed of wood which was originally in the table ( presumption ( 3 ) ) , that this wood probably partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) ) , and was always located roughly at the place in the table from which it eventually emerged ( presumption ( 2 ) ) . And all of this happened in accordance with the type T law mentioned before ( i.e. , the law that a bit of wood tends to conserve its size , weight , and shape ) . I have been at pains to establish that our concept of the persistence of matter is relatively theoretical as compared to our concept of the observable persistence of an ordinary articulated object , and that , as a consequence of this fact , we should be able to imagine what it would be like to live in a world in which we had a commonsense use for the latter concept but not the former . A somewhat different and perhaps easier point , which reinforces the previous one , is that we can imagine what it would be like for our concept of the persistence of ordinary objects to function normally while the concept of the persistence of matter is repudiated at the highest theoretical levels . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in which ordinary objects in fact persist without any matter in fact persisting . ) It certainly seems that scientists might tell us that there is no such thing as an underlying level of persisting matter , but that some radically different conception affords the ultimate explanation of physical phenomena . ( Indeed on some readings of contemporary physics it may possibly be that scientists have told us this . ) But this would not ( and should not ) prevent us from continuing to judge in the normal way about the identity of ordinary observable objects.8 8 . Compare with Sydney Shoemaker 's criticism of Chisholm 's position in " The Loose and Popular and the Strict and Philosophical Senses of Identity , " in Norman S. Care and Robert H. Grimm , eds. , Perception and Personal Identity ( The Press of Western Reserve University , Cleveland , 1969 ) , pp. 108-9.  | It follows from the above account that I would regard our concept of the persistence of ordinary articulated objects as decisively more primary than our concept of persisting matter . This implies a repudiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions of identity ) of stating identity criteria for ordinary objects in terms of a prior notion of persisting matter.9 Often this procedure will take the form of substituting for the requirement of spatiotemporal and qualitative continuity the requirement that an object 's material composition can alter only gradually . Now these requirements do in practice amount to virtually the same thing , but it is nevertheless a major error of principle to inject the concept of persisting matter into the very center of our ordinary identity criteria . The clear and observational concept of the persistence of an ordinary object deserves to be kept relatively disentangled from the more difficult and theoretical concept of persisting matter . We have , and have the right to have , a concept of persistence which operates essentially at the most straightforward observable level without much concern for what may be happening in the theoretical depths . This is not necessarily to rule out the possibility that our relatively theoretical judgments about matter might marginally influence our judgments about ordinary objects . Such influence may be present in the following sort of case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glue the fragments back together into a table . I should then probably want to say that it was the same table again , basing myself presumably on the judgment that " it 's still the same matter . " If this is correct then we have here a counterexample to the overall sortal analysis , insofar as we regard this analysis as implying that the identity of 9 . Locke , An Essay Concerning Human Understanding . Chisholm 's account of persistence seems to contain a variant of the same ( I think objectionable ) procedure . On his account our concept of the persistence of an ordinary object apparently depends upon our prior concept of the persistence of what he sometimes calls the " primary objects " which constitute ordinary objects , where these " primary objects " seem to be pretty much the same as what I am calling " portions of matter . " Besides the previously cited works , see his Person and Object ( Open Court , LaSalle , Ill. , 1976 ) , " Problems of Identity " in M. K. Munitz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N. Y. , 1971 ) , and " Identity Through Time " in H. E. Kiefer and M. K. Munitz , eds. , Language , Belief , and Metaphysics ( State University of New York , Albany , N. Y. , 1970 ) .  | a standard object must be determined either by the observable sortal-covered continuity of the object , or by the observable sortal-covered continuity of the ( major ) parts that compose the object . In the present case the judgment about the identity of the table would be based neither on the sortal-covered continuity of the table , nor on compositional considerations about the observable sortal-covered continuity of parts of the table . It seems that we perhaps need to relax the compositional criterion by allowing into play theoretical compositional considerations visa-vis the identity of matter . It should be remarked , however , that this possible counterexample to the sortal analysis of the identity of standard objects infects only the supplementary compositional criterion , but not the primary criterion of sortal-covered continuity expressed by the sortal rule . We have still found nothing to jeopardize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of a standard object ; and we can still uphold the general idea that a logically necessary and sufficient condition for the identity of a standard object is that it satisfy either the primary sortal rule or the supplementary compositional criterion , though the latter is perhaps seen now as infected by the identity of matter.10 As regards the identity of matter , of course , my whole argument has been to show that the sortal analysis ( at least at an observational level ) is inadequate , and that theoretical considerations are required to define the identity of matter . A question which might be addressed to my account is whether I would say that a continuous portion of matter can persist as that identical matter when it is fragmented . To this I would suggest that , as with all questions about the identity of matter , it must be settled on theoretical grounds , which means ultimately by the scientist . From the standpoint of elementary physics and chemistry it seems that various conservation laws imply that a portion of matter does not go out of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should then say that a fragmented portion of matter , which was once continuous , is ( still ) in any sense an " object , " this seems to be merely an inconsequential point of terminology which we can settle as we so . This formulation of the general identity conditions for standard objects will be reconsidered in Chapter 7.  | like . And , of course , elementary physics and chemistry may not give us the final answer . Again , from my point of view it would be a question essentially to be settled by scientific theory whether or not matter can jump discontinuously through space ( a possibility which some contemporary scientists may take seriously ) . I can see no decisive reason to rule this out a priori . This possibility , by the way , carries with it a correlative possibility with respect to standard objects , assuming that the compositional criterion is now properly regarded as embracing the identity of matter . Suppose that a table vanishes into thin air , and that immediately afterwards a table bearing all of the distinctive marks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our theoretical-explanatory needs might possibly induce us in such a case to hypothesize that the matter which constituted the first table jumped discontinuously through space and now constitutes the second table , we might also be entitled , via the compositional criterion , to judge that the first table is the same as the second . I want to note that Russell sometimes explains the identity of matter in terms akin to the account that I have been presenting . After posing a problem about the identity of a drop of water in the sea in the passage last quoted he goes on to say : " The characteristic required in addition to continuity is conformity with the laws of dynamics . " 11 If by " the laws of dynamics " Russell means the body of scientific laws that make reference to bits of matter then this seems fairly close to what I am saying . Often , however , Russell seems also to be suggesting that the condition of conformity to laws has a special bearing not only on the identity of matter , but on the identity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear what this could mean . Certainly even the most elementary laws of physics do not make reference to any standard objects , as ordinarily conceived . For example , the elementary law " For every bit of matter x , x 's mass never changes " is not satisfied by a car as ordinarily thought of , since a car 's mass changes whenever a tire is removed . All that this shows of course is that the physicist 's 1 i . " The Relation of Sense-Data to Physics , " p. 171. 12 . Such a suggestion seems pretty clearly implicit in his discussion in Human Knowledge , Its Scope and Limits ( Simon &; Schuster , New York , 1948 ) , pp. 458-60.  | laws do not refer to ( do not quantify over ) standard objects as such , that a car is not ( strictly identical with ) a bit of matter . The physicist explains what happens to the car on the basis of what happens to the matter which makes it up . But then what precise bearing do the physicist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ? We can perhaps say ( and this is what Russell seems sometimes to have in mind ) that the career of a car exemplifies , if not the physicist 's laws , at least some rough regularities in terms of which the successive stages of the car can be thought of as to some degree causally connected ( in terms of which , as Russell sometimes puts it , the successive stages of the car can be thought of as forming a " causal line " ) .13 But whatever precisely this might mean it seems that we could certainly say the same thing about the career of a shrinking incar , viz. that it exemplifies some rough regularities in terms of which its successive stages can be thought of as to some degree causally connected . This very weak condition of causal connectedness does not , therefore , even rule out drastic part-whole tracing confusions . As such it seems to have no clear role to play in an analysis of identity.14 I am tentatively inclined to think that with respect to what is most plausibly regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert or technical level ) we should mention the condition of conformity to law only in the context of a discussion of the identity of matter . And here the idea is that the identity of matter is determined by theoretical considerations , and is ultimately clarified by the laws of science . As regards standard objects the essential condition to mention is sortalcovered , or change-minimizing , continuity . Laws of physics ( and chemistry ) , which describe the behavior of matter , are of course not the only laws of science there are , though it is often held that all laws are ultimately reducible 13 . Ibid. 14 . The relationship between causality and identity is examined further in Chapter 7 . But let me here stress one point : If it is held that causal connectedness is an essential aspect of the continuity of a body 's history , then the causal condition can be added to the other continuity conditions in the Simple Continuity Analysis of Chapter 1 , the Sortal Rule of Chapter 2 , and the Basic Rule of Chapter 3 ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter and standard objects ) remains essentially intact .  | to these . We can perhaps think of the identity conditions associated with such essentially technical concepts as " bacterium " and " cell " as determined by the theoretical needs of biology in rather the way that the identity of matter is determined by the theoretical needs of physics . But I think that we should resist the possible suggestion that even such nontechnical notions as " same tree " and " same cat " ought to be seen as ultimately determined by how these notions can be made to figure in the best laws of biology.15 This suggestion can plausibly be resisted at least to the extent of maintaining that there is a nontechnical sense ( level , part ) of the concept " same tree , " or " same cat , " which operates quite independently of biological theory , and which is determined essentially by relatively straightforward considerations of observable sortal-covered , or change-minimizing , continuity . If it is agreed that our ordinary concept of the persistence of a car is essentially unaffected by physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , then what reason would there be to suppose that our ordinary concept of the persistence of a tree is somehow contingent upon biological theory ? It seems more plausible to characterize all of our ordinary concepts of the persistence of standard objects , whether these objects be man-made or natural , as operating in essential independence of scientific-theoretic considerations , and as being essentially definable in the relatively simple terms of sortal-covered , or changeminimizing , continuity . For the case of the identity of matter , on the other hand , we apparently can not coherently distinguish any sense of the concept which is not already implicated in essentially theoretical considerations , considerations which are then eventually elaborated by science . In summary , I have discussed altogether three commonsense ideas of physical persistence : the basic conception , the sortal conception , and now the theoretical-explanatory conception of 15 . Such a suggestion might be implicit in the approach to " natural kinds " that one finds in Hilary Putnam , " Is Semantics Possible ? " in H. E. Kiefer and M. K. Munitz , eds. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mind , Language and Reality ( Cambridge University Press , Cambridge , London , 1975 ) ; and in Saul Kripke , " Naming and Necessity , " in D. Davidson and G. Harman , eds. , Semantics of Natural Language ( D. Reidel , Dordrecht , 1972 ) , republished as Naming and Necessity ( Harvard University Press , Cambridge , Mass. , 198o ) .  | persisting matter . The connection between the first two of these was that the sortal conception serves primarily to clarify the basic one . Can we see any other connections here ? I think we easily can . Perhaps any observational concept is amenable to theoretical extension . But there seems to be a sense in which our basic concept of persistence stands especially ready for this . The core of the basic conception was the rule that an object 's career should be traced so as to minimize changes . But there seems to be a very natural movement of thought from saying " Minimize changes " to saying " Simplify changes . " We can think of this movement as passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an object unless it is necessary . " This can be interpreted to mean " unless it is necessary for tracing the object in a continuous path , " which gives us the basic rule , and its eventual sortal clarification . Or it can mean " unless it is necessary for providing the simplest explanation of the phenomena , " which gives us the general procedure for judging of the persistence of matter . As I see it , then , at the root of our concept of physical persistence is the vague rule of minimizing changes . From this rule there emanate two rather contrasting conceptions , on the one hand the relatively concrete and definite conception of the persistence of different sorts of articulated objects , and on the other the relatively abstract and indefinite conception of persisting matter .  | ONE KIND of question that may motivate a philosophical examination of the concept of physical persistence is whether this concept is indispensable to our thought about the world , or whether we could , on the contrary , conceive of the world in some radically different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the observable persistence of standard objects , like cars , and tables , and trees ; in later sections I will extend the discussion to include the persistence of matter . ( But it should be understood that special problems revolving around the persistence of persons are not to be treated until a later chapter , except perhaps in an occasional parenthetical aside . ) It seems to follow immediately from the preceding account that the persistence of a car , or a table , or a tree boils down essentially to there being a continuously related succession of car-stages , or table-stages , or tree-stages . This point would admittedly need to be complicated to accommodate the compositional criterion . But there would seem to be nothing in this complication to discourage the general conclusion that , for any standard sortal F , our ordinary descriptions of the persistence of an F-thing could be dispensed with in favor of descriptions of F-stages and their interrelations . There are in principle an indefinite number of possible constructions in terms of which ordinary talk about the persistence of , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrelations of car-stages . We could construct a language which allowed us to refer only to car-stages that last for one year or less , or to car-stages that last for as long as they maintain a constant color , or to car-stages that satisfy any number of other possible specifications . Each such construction would apparently allow us to redescribe what we ordinarily express about persisting cars in terms of descriptions of how car-stages ( of this or that specification ) are related to each other . The most obvious , and also most radical , construction along these general lines is one in which we are allowed to refer only to momentary car-stages . This construction strikes us as particularly challenging insofar as it seems to depart as far as possible from the ordinary idea of an enduring object . I do not , however , want to get bogged down now over puzzles about whether momentary car-stages are to be conceived of as literally instantaneous or , if not , how long they last . Some of these puzzles would be merely reformulations of perennial puzzles in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present case . ' I will assume that a " momentary " car-stage is of relatively short duration as compared to the normal duration of a car as ordinarily conceived of , but I will leave it open just how short this is . We can imagine , then , a language , let us call it the M-language , within which only momentary object-stages ( and their sets , successions , etc. ) are referred to and described . In this language we could say " A car-stage is ( spatially ) in contact with a treestage , " or " There occurs a continuous succession of tree-stages , " or " There occurs a discontinuous succession containing treestages followed by car-stages . " But we would not talk in ordinary ways about the persistence of a car or a tree . To suggest that we could in principle dispense with our ordinary concept of the persistence of a standard object in favor of the M-language means essentially this . For any ordinary statement 0 which describes in ordinary terms the career of a standard object , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M are equivalent . But the kind of " equivalence " that is to obtain between 0 and M must not be construed too 1 . Cf. my earlier questions about the duration of an " intrinsic car-stage " ; Chapter 3 , pp. 10e-4.  | stringently . Certainly we can not expect that M should constitute a straightforward translation of the ordinary statement 0 , in the sense in which a French statement might constitute a translation of an English statement . Nor , even , do we want to require that 0 and M should be analytically equivalent ( i.e. , that they should analytically entail each other ) in the strict sense in which , for example , " x is a triangle " is analytically equivalent to " x is a three-sided polygon . " For one thing , an ordinary statement 0 will suffer from some margin of vagueness , in virtue of which certain states of affairs would render its truth-value indeterminate . And we have no reason to require that M should so perfectly match up with 0 as to mirror exactly this margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our purposes if the force of M approximates even roughly to that of O. The question which concerns us is whether the M-language has as much fact-stating power as our ordinary language , whether the Mlanguage would allow us to describe the world as we experience it without , so to speak , missing out on anything . Certainly the previous account of the nature of physical persistence would suggest an affirmative answer to this question ( at least insofar as we continue to limit our attention to the observable persistence of standard objects ) . That account would seem to imply that , in terms of the idea of sortal-covered ( or change-minimizing ) continuity , we could in principle frame descriptions within the M-language that are loosely , even if not strictly , equivalent to our ordinary descriptions of persisting objects . It might be suggested that the M-language does not really dispense with the concept of a persisting object since even in that language we can refer to successions of momentary stages , and these successions , insofar as they contain elements that exist at different times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a relatively unimportant point of terminology whether we apply the expression " persisting object , " and kindred expressions , to an M-level succession . The more important point is that an M-level succession is not governed by any rules of identity through time of the sort that govern our ordinary thought . ( I want to ignore any questions about identity through space in the present discussion . ) At the M-level any succession of momentary stages , however the succession might be formed ( i.e. , even if it combines what would ordinarily be thought of  | as the stages of different objects ) , counts equally with any other . This is the essential contrast with our ordinary conception , which accords the special status of persistence , of unity through time , to just those select successions of object-stages that are related in some special way ( e.g. , by sortal-covered continuity ) . The idea of the M-language is essentially the idea of a language without rules of identity through time , a language in which any succession of momentary object-stages is logically on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one very important sense , a language without the concept of persistence . And it appears now that we could describe the world in terms of such a language . A question might be raised about the intelligibility of the idea of an " object-stage " within the M-language . Object-stages , it might be objected , are abstract items ( perhaps ordered pairs of objects and times ) , which go together to make up another kind of abstract item , the career or history of an object . But our idea of these abstract items presupposes the idea of a concrete persisting object . If we , therefore , try to do without our ordinary concept of a persisting object we can no longer understand what an object-stage is . Now this objection is well taken insofar as it emphasizes the kind of conceptual departure from ordinary thought which the M-language would have to embody . From the point of view of the M-language a " momentary object-stage " must be conceived of as a concrete entity , which has the various properties ( of shape , color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a given moment . We would therefore do better , perhaps , to represent the M-language as containing such expressions as " succession of ( momentary ) trees , " rather than " succession of ( momentary ) tree-stages . " It may be admitted that ordinary language does not permit us to think of a persisting object as temporally divisible into concrete momentary parts . But there seems to be nothing incoherent about a conceptual revision which would permit this . The legitimacy of thinking about an object as divisible into temporal parts has been amply defended in recent literature . Quine , for example , expresses this idea as follows : " A physical thing ? whether a river or a human body or a stone ? is at any one moment a sum of simultaneous momentary states of spatially scattered atoms or other small physical constituents . Now just  | as the thing at a moment is a sum of these spatially small parts , so we may think of the thing over a period as a sum of the temporally small parts which are its successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as extended in time and in space alike . " 2 For my present purposes there is no important distinction to be drawn between the M-language and Quine 's " space-time " conception . The essential characterization of both conceptions is that they contain no rules of identity through time , and are therefore in an important sense free of the concept of persistence . Quine 's space-time idiom suggests the point that the momentary items that figure in the persistence-free conception are to be conceived of as concrete entities , on a parallel with the concreteness of the spatially small parts of objects . Moreover Quine 's space-time idiom contains the intrinsically interesting ( though , for my present purposes , not especially relevant ) twist of regarding the successions ( " sums , " as Quine called them ) that are formed from the momentary items as themselves concrete entities that are extended in space and time . From Quine 's spacetime vantage point reality is seen as comprised of concrete space-time portions , whether continuous or discontinuous , that can be characterized in many of the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to keep in central focus is that the space-time portions of reality figuring in Quine 's scheme crisscross and overlap in every conceivable way , and are not conceptually structured by the kinds of identity rules that govern our ordinary concept of persistence . There is evidently no prima facie connection between the idea of a language that lacks rules of identity through time , a language in which any succession of momentary items is logically on a par with any other , and the idea of a language that lacks the distinction between subjective experience and objective physical reality . It is true that many philosophers of the past who have tried to conceive of the physical world as ultimately composed of momentary things were phenomenalists . Their momentary things were sense data and the like , items that were supposed to be mental ( or private ) . But the kind of persistence2 . W. V. Quine , Methods of Logic , 3rd ed . ( Holt , Rinehart and Winston , Inc. , N.Y. , 1972 ) , p. 222 . For further discussion of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , below .  | free conception that I have been talking about is not intended to be in the least bit tainted by phenomenalism . Certainly the momentary things that figure in Quine 's space-time conception are supposed to be fully objective ; and the conception as a whole is to be an analytic restructuring of our ordinary thought about the physical world , with no loss of any sense of objectivity . Now there may possibly be some deep arguments to establish that our distinction between subjective experience and objective physical reality is inextricably linked to our conceptually structuring physical reality in terms of rules of identity through time . But such a linkage would certainly need to be established , and not merely taken for granted . I do not in fact know of any relatively clear argument which might establish this linkage . And my impression is that many recent discussions of the subjective-objective distinction simply take the linkage for granted without seeing the need to establish it . Such seems to be the case in Strawson 's discussion of the conditions of objectivity in his chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two questions . The first is whether the conditions of a " non-solipsistic consciousness " can be fulfilled within a purely auditory experience , that is , roughly , whether a being whose experience was purely auditory could make sense out of a distinction between subjective experience and objective reality . The second question is whether there could be enduring ( persisting ) and reidentifiable sound-particulars in the purely auditory world . Strawson argues that an affirmative answer to the first question would necessarily carry with it an affirmative answer to the second : For to have a conceptual scheme in which a distinction is made between oneself and one 's states and auditory items which are not states of oneself , is to have a conceptual scheme in which the existence of auditory items is logically independent of the existence of one 's states or of oneself . Thus it is to have a conceptual scheme in which it is logically possible that such items should exist whether or not they were being observed , and hence should continue to exist through an interval during which they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case that there could be reidentifiable particulars in a purely auditory world if the conditions of a non-solipsistic consciousness could be fulfilled for such a world .3 3 . Strawson , Individuals , p. 72.  | I want to focus on the second sentence in the above argument . The sentence begins with the correct observation that a nonsolipsistic consciousness would necessarily require a conceptual scheme in which certain items are thought of as existing while unobserved . But then Strawson simply jumps at the end of the sentence to the unargued conclusion that , since these items are being thought of as existing while unobserved , they must be thought of as continuing to exist while unobserved , i.e. , they must be thought of as enduring particulars . But why could not the auditory scheme fulfill the conditions of a non-solipsistic consciousness by including the idea of objective momentary sounds , and successions of momentary sounds , which exist while unobserved ? How has Strawson established the necessity of enduring sounds ? Of course , if by a " reidentifiable sound , " a " sound that continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds , then his conclusion would follow trivially . But it is evident that this is not Strawson 's intention . He is clearly trying to establish the necessity of enduring sound-particulars in the sense of particulars that are governed by rules of identity through time , rules which are satisfied only by certain successions of sounds , and which accord only to these successions the special status of enduring particulars . But Strawson has failed to show ( at least in the quoted passage ) that a scheme of objective particulars must necessarily include any such rules of identity through time . IT . A Question about Spatiotemporal Continuity Our ability to redescribe the world of standard objects in the persistence-free terms of the M-language ( the space-time language ) would depend upon our being able to express within that language the idea that a succession of momentary things is spatiotemporally and qualitatively continuous . The notion of qualitative continuity seems to present no special difficulty since the application of this notion requires nothing more than our ability to make qualitative comparisons between the momentary things which comprise a succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special difficulty . In Chapter I , I defined several senses of spatiotemporal con-  | tinuity , all of which revolved around the idea of two places overlapping each other . Roughly , a succession S was said to be spatiotemporally continuous if the places which coincide with temporally neighboring stages in S overlap , where the extent of overlap that was required varied with each definition . Now to say that two places overlap each other is obviously to say that they overlap each other at a given time . That is , the places must exist simultaneously . Of course when we say that two places overlap each other we need not relativize this remark to some specific time , since if two places ever overlap they always overlap . The overlap relations , as well as the distance relations , between places can not possibly change . But the fact that we need not specify a time must not obscure the point that for places to overlap they must exist together , i.e. , at the same time . For S to be spatiotemporally continuous the place  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at t1 , must overlap the place  | , which is occupied by the momentary thing in S at t2 , where t , and t2 are neighboring times . This means that p , and  | must exist together at some time , that we can not think of p , as existing only at t , and  | existing only at t2 . We can not , that is , think of p , and  | as " momentary places , " the counterparts of momentary things . It is necessary that we should think of p , and  | as ordinary persisting places , which exist not only at t ? or at t2 , but throughout an extended period , during which they continually overlap . The upshot of this is that if the notion of spatiotemporal continuity is to be explained along the general lines discussed in Chapter 1 , then this notion involves essentially the idea of a persisting place . The difficulty now is that the idea of a persisting place seems to presuppose the idea of a persisting object . Indeed the identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as relative to some specific object or system of objects . A succession of lightning flashes that occur at the same place relative to the earth occur at different places relative to the sun . This suggests that our ordinary notion of " same place again " is in effect short for " same place relative to such-and-such objects , " where the specified objects supply a coordinate system in terms of which any place can be assigned a unique , and permanent , set of coordinates . ( Roughly , we are at the same place relative to suchand-such objects if we are at the same distance and direction  | from the objects . ) Consequently the M-language ( the space-time language ) , which excludes the ordinary idea of a persisting object , can not be coherently thought of as containing the idea of a persisting place . How , then , can it contain the required notion of spatiotemporal continuity ? I think that there are essentially two ways in which we might respond to this question . The more moderate way would be to concede the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the persistence-free language ; the more radical way would be to concede nothing to the question . Let me first explain the moderate approach . Suppose that we concede the point that the notion of spatiotemporal continuity can not be understood independently of our concepts of persisting objects and persisting places . This would imply that the world as we know it could not be adequately described at the persistence-free level , that a thoroughgoing reduction of our identity concepts in terms of the persistence-free level is not possible . However , we could still consider the following more limited possibility . We might designate some specific group of objects as providing our spatial framework . The identity concepts associated with these objects are not to be dispensed with in the persistence-free language but are to be taken for granted . Then , presupposing the spatial framework provided by these concepts , we could render all other identity concepts in persistence-free terms . We might , for example , designate buildings and their parts as the objects that provide the framework . Presumably the class of buildings and their parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , movable rigid bodies , and whatever else may be required to coordinate in the ordinary manner a system of persisting places . Given a system of persisting places we can define spatiotemporal continuity as in Chapter 1 . And now the persistence of every standard object other than buildings and their parts can be rendered in persistence-free terms . According to the moderate account it is incorrect to say , " We could redescribe the world of standard objects in such a way that , for every sortal F , our language would not employ the concept of the persistence of an F-thing . " But it remains correct to say , " For every sortal F , we could redescribe the world of standard objects in such a way that our language would not  | employ the concept of the persistence of an F-thing . " We are not , that is , permitted to think of all our ordinary descriptions of persisting objects as eliminable in toto by the persistence-free language . We can , however , think of any specific range of such descriptions as eliminable without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spatial framework thereby provided , we can dispense with persisting trees ; and perhaps vice versa . But some objects must remain to provide the framework . The general category of a persisting physical object would thus be seen as an irreducible and indispensable component of our thought about the world , but the specific embodiments of this category in our various concepts of specific kinds of objects may be severely limited without detriment to the facts . This moderate account strikes me as adopting an uncomfortable half-way position . If we can , so to speak , get rid of any kind of persisting object that we choose then it seems unsatisfactory to insist that we somehow can not get rid of all of them together . I think that there is in fact no compelling reason to limit the scope of the persistence-free language in the way that the moderate approach suggests . The kind of explanation of spatiotemporal continuity that I gave earlier , in terms of a presupposed framework of persisting places , is one natural-seeming explanation of that notion within our ordinary conceptual scheme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion in a different light as it figures in the persistence-free scheme . In the latter scheme spatiotemporal continuity might be treated as a primitive idea which is explained ostensively , i.e. , by exhibiting examples of spatiotemporally continuous successions . There seems in general to be no uniquely correct way to order our ideas ; and in the present case , at any rate , the alternative of treating spatiotemporal continuity as primitive , rather than as defined in terms of other concepts , seems quite plausible . Certainly we may be inclined to think of the spatial continuity of an object at a given moment as directly observable and conceptually simple . Why then should we not treat the spatiotemporal continuity of a temporally extended portion of reality in the same light ? 4 4 . Compare with Whitehead 's treatment of the continuity of an " event , " in The Concept of Nature , pp. 74-78 . I defend the primitiveness of spatiotemporal continuity further in Chapter 6 , Sections V and VII .  | The analogy to spatial continuity may suggest a slightly different approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated as a primitive concept , but it may also be defined in several ways , one of which is this : " x is spatially continuous at time t " can be defined as meaning that , for any y and z , if y and z exhaustively comprise x at t ( i.e. , y and z are parts of x such that any part of x overlaps either y or z ) , and y and z do not overlap at t , then y and z touch each other at t . ( I am allowing for the possibility that overlapping objects perhaps can not be said to touch each other . ) Here we define spatial continuity in terms of touching , though the reverse procedure seems equally plausible . The term " spatiotemporal contiguity " is sometimes used to signify the spatiotemporal analogue of touching , to signify , that is , the relationship which stands to spatiotemporal continuity in the way that touching stands to spatial continuity . Hence " The succession S is spatiotemporally continuous " is equivalent to " For any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segments of S which exhaustively comprise S , and Si and S2 do not overlap , then Si and S2 are spatiotemporally contiguous to each other . " If we can assume the notion of spatiotemporal contiguity in the persistence-free language then we can easily define spatiotemporal continuity in terms of it . Now the ordinary notion of one thing turning into ( being replaced by ) another thing , in those cases in which the second thing might be said to come into existence when the first thing goes out of existence , is closely related to the idea of spatiotemporal contiguity . The proposition " x went out of existence and turned into y , which came into existence " ( e.g. , " The car went out of existence and turned into the block of scrap metal , which came into existence " ) can be roughly associated with the proposition " A terminal segment of x 's career is spatiotemporally contiguous with an initial segment of y 's career . " To ascertain just how close this association is would require a more detailed examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to undertake . But even a rather loose association encourages the judgment that , if the ordinary notion of " turning into " can be treated as a primitive observational concept , and this seems quite plausible , then it should also be possible to treat spatiotemporal contiguity in the same spirit . And given  | spatiotemporal contiguity we can , as indicated before , immediately define spatiotemporal continuity . ( Hence the idea of a spatiotemporally continuous succession can be loosely associated with the idea of a succession which is such that any early segment " turns into " a later segment . ) I conclude that the required notion of spatiotemporal continuity can be made available in the persistence-free language without relying on a presupposed framework of persisting places . Though it seems reasonable from the ordinary point of view to connect the notion of spatiotemporal continuity to our ordinary idea of a system of persisting places , severing this connection appears to impose no overwhelming strain on our understanding . It seems therefore that we can adequately redescribe the world of standard objects in wholly persistence-free terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical object can be regarded as consisting simply in the occurrence of a succession of momentary things , which is spatiotemporally and qualitatively continuous , and sortal-covered or change-minimizing . This is obviously so if we accept the radical account , according to which the notion of spatiotemporal continuity can be made intelligible within a wholly persistence-free language . But even if we limit ourselves to the more moderate account , and think of the persistence-free language as presupposing a background of persisting objects , in terms of which the required notion of spatiotemporal continuity is explained , the conclusion still holds that , given some relatively limited background of persisting objects , the persistence of all other objects could be rendered in persistence-free terms . At the very least , then , we can regard the persistence of any specific object , or even any specific range of objects , as consisting simply in the successive existence of suitably related momentary things . This conclusion may make us feel somewhat uneasy . We may be inclined to say that if the persistence of a given object boils down to nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary things , then the object does not really persist at all , and our ordinary way of thinking about the matter is simply wrong . But the inclination to say this , however natural
