DR . M'GLYNN 'S SUCCESSOR . The Rev. Father Charles H. Colton , whose appointment as one of the Assistant Pastors of St. Stephen 's in place of the Rev. Dr. James T. Curran was published yesterday morning , is to be the Rector of the parish , to succeed Dr. . Father Donnelly will stay at St. Stephen 's only until the formalities preliminary to the induction of the new Rector are complied with , when he will return to St. Michael 's . Father Colton ? is about 40 years of age , and was educated for the priesthood at St. Joseph 's Theological Seminary , at Troy , N. Y. He has been in orders 10 years . Previous to last October , when he was transferred to Port Chester and made the Pastor - of the Church ' of Our Lady of Mercy , he was an assistant Pastor of St. Stephen 's for about five years . There he became very popular with the parishioners , and he left with their great regret . He is not especially noted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is unexcelled . Most of the parishioners are glad , if they are to have any other Pastor than Dr. , that it is to be Father Colton . One of ? his characteristics  --  a constant and kind visitation of the sick and decrepit  --  was fondly referred to by several of the female parishioners yesterday , and after some grumbling by the most bitter his Rectorship will undoubtedly be acquiesced in . He will say mass next Sunday . Father Donnelly again employed the police last night . Since the gates of the basement on Twenty-ninth-street have been closed some two . hundred women , boys , and girls have been in the habit of assembling there every evening , gaining an entrance by means of stairs leading down from the back entry of the church . At 9 o'clock last evening Father Donnelly came out of the baptistery and pleasantly told the crowd to go home . They responded with abuse , pressed close to him on all sides in a compact mob , and made it almost impossible for him to move . With difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old confessional , adorned with his portrait , and redecorated with flowers every day , and again repeated his advice to go home . Nobody obeyed him , and , making his way slowly back to the baptistery , he opened the door and admitted Captain Ryan and Detective Mullarkey , of the Twenty-first Precinct , and a policeman in uniform . Capt . Ryan made a few witty , but not at all complimentary , remarks to the crowd , and told them to go home . Then he and his assistants proceeded to move them . It took some time , for the reason that as fast as the officers got the girls to the foot of the stairs they went behind his back and returned to the confessional . It seemed for a few minutes as though a few arrests must be made , so personal to Father Donnelly and Capt . Ryan became the remarks of the crowd , especially the elderly women . They hissed Father Donnelly vigorously several times . He took it good-naturedly . As soon as the last child was out the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who suffered most was a poor little altar boy whom Father Donnelly brought over from St. Michael 's . He was foolish enough to come out and stand by Father Donnelly during the fuss . The women caught him , hustled him about , and cuffed him soundly . He retired howling . Father Donnelly yesterday denied the reports , which were freely circulated , that the church was to be closed if any disturbance was made next Sunday . It will be kept open , " said he . " I expect no more trouble of any consequence . The collections will be taken up on Sunday , and everything . will go on as usual . " All caretul observers are of the opinion that Father Donnelly is right . The feelings of revolt have greatly decreased during the week . The most influential or the parishioners take no part in the demonstrations against Father Donnelly . They regret very much that Dr. has been superceded , and they love him as much as ever . But they say that they are Catholics , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry George is a constant visitor of Father , and that he is using all his influence to prevent his going to Rome , has a great influence on the more conservative and influential of the parishioners . They want him to . go to Rome and advocate his case . If'he should determine not to go it would be a great blow to them and would practically destroy his influence over them . Nothing is more certain than that they will not follow him out of the church . Dr. Shrady said last evening that Dr. 's condition was still improving , but that his full answer to the Archbishop would not be ready until the first of next week . The committee of parishioners is meditating the giving of a grand concert in aid of the fund . Father Donnelly has been flooded with absurd letters since he came to St. Stephen 's of every degree of spelling and grammar except good . Dr. 's friends claim that they were sent by the doctor 's enemies to prejudice his cause .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
