<p> Two experts at drawing plants and animals share their insights and secrets , including how to use research to make accurate drawings . <p> Although you may not know their names , the work of Sy and Dorothea Barlowe probably looks quite familiar  --  and understandably so . Between the two of them , this married couple has been responsible for the illustration of most of the classic nature guides currently in print . If you 've ever gone on a bird-calling expedition , collected butterflies , studied the growth of flowers and plants , taken an interest in the small creatures found in your backyard , or tried to pinpoint the exact species of some animal you 'd seen in the zoo , you 've probably referred to the Barlowes ' easy-to-understand and accurate renderings . Trees , Seashores , and Non-Flowering Plants , all part of the Golden series of classic nature guides published by Golden Press , are just a few of the titles that have been illustrated by these experts . <p> Despite the impressive amount of scientific knowledge they collected for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not scientists . It was through their professional experience and training that they were able to develop their knowledge of nature and their skills at drawings and painting it . What has made them such authorities is essentially their ability to use research well , and the patience to use the information they get . <p> Both Sy and Dot , as Dorothea is known , began their professional art careers at New York City 's American Museum of Natural History in the 1940s  --  Sy in the preparations department , and Dot as a staff illustrator . It was there , surrounded by specimens of all kinds and by experts such as museum curators , archaeologists , and scientists , that the two of them began to develop their vast knowledge of the natural world . In the preparations department , for example , Sy 's responsibilities often included working on the backgrounds for the dioramas that contain mounted animals ; through this experience , he became familiar with the types of environments that certain animals inhabit as well as becoming quite adept at painting the animals themselves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects and from interaction with the museum staff , the couple set out on their own . In 1950 , four years after their marriage , Sy and Dot Barlowe began working together as freelance illustrators . During the following years , the two of them produced mostly opaque watercolor illustrations , with occasional excursions into pen-and-ink or scratchboard , many of these for nature books for some of the largest publishing housers in America , including Knopt , Random House , Putman , Grosset and Dunlap , Morrow , Follett , American Heritage Press , and Harper &; Row . Over the years , they have also done features for magazines and newspapers , including The New York Times and Long Island Newsday . The Living Bird , and Archeology . In addition , the Barlowes have contributed illustrations to encyclopedias , reference books such as Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau , and nature guides , among them the Audubon Encyclopedia of North American Birds . They have created material  --  both visual and written  --  for children 's books , film strips , and more recently have even delved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Their newest endeavor is a limited-edition series of collectors ' plates , which are being produced by Reco International . Each plate features a portrait of an important animal , framed and with an original border and motifs representing either the culture of the country the animal inhabits or that animal 's natural habitat . Sy and Dot Barlowe have worked both jointly and individually on many projects , sometimes combining their own special preferences in a single painting : Sy usually paints animals and birds , while Dot paints plants and flowers . In their new series of collectors ' plates , for example , Sy painted the animal in the foreground while Dot painted the background landscape . <p> Whether working separately or together , both artists , who have taught nature and botanical illustration courses at Parsons School of Design in New York City , emphasize the fact that portraying animals and environments in the natural world is a highly specialized branch of illustration . <p> Therefore , they stress the importance of doing accurate scientific research in this type of work . In their book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in nature illustration , " the artist is honor-bound to tell the truth . Depicting a creature in its natural habitat can be a minor education in itself , for doing so requires the consideration of many different aspects of the animal 's life . " According to the Barlowes , if you are painting animals , one of the most important ways to research your subject is working from live animals . However , this does not necessarily require expensive and time-consuming travel . The artists themselves have lived on Long Island in New York for many years and have never needed to travel to such places as India , Africa , or Australia to study exotic creatures ; they have managed to conduct their research and complete their work close to home through the use of museum , zoos , and libraries . <p> If you are planning to draw and paint animals , the two suggest spending a day or two working at the zoo or at a local natural-history museum . If you have a reasonably good camera , they recommend taking it with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zoo or of exhibits at a natural-history museum ( if you 're allowed ) can start you on your way to gathering a collection of animal photos and sketches with which you can establish your own reference library . <p> One important consideration , the artists note , is that in order to show an animal properly , the nature illustrator must thoroughly research the creature 's living habits as well as its physique , answering such questions as : Where exactly does it live ? What other forms of life coexist with it ? What kinds of plants are prevalent in its typical environment ? The artist must make certain that parallel life forms are consistent with the time of year , or that the young of a species are shown in the appropriate size relationship . <p> When starting your photo and slide collection , these artists urge their students to remember not to focus only on the animal itself , but to examine its environment . You can add to your research library with pictures from your own backyard , if you live in the country ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can take pictures of natural settings at a local zoo . Shoot photos of forests , meadows , ponds , and all kinds of plants and flowers , and add them to your collection . The next step is simple : You can use an encyclopedia to match these habitats with the animals that are typically found living in them . <p> When drawing an animal , the most important challenge lies in knowing what the animal is like physically  --  how it moves , what makes it special among its kind , how it survives  --  and then depicting it in an appropriate environment . As with drawing the human figure , understanding the physical structure of the animal you are trying to draw or paint can be extremely helpful . " Small details in the individual species , " says Sy Barlowe , " such as the lift to the head , the expression in the eyes , the texture of the fur , lend your work a realistic quality . " The Barlowes stress the importance of becoming comfortable with the anatomy and skeleton of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an encyclopedia . " Bone structure and muscles play a definite role in how an animal moves , " adds Dot . " Try drawing the skeleton that lies under the animal you are painting to understand the animal better ; you can then look it up in an encyclopedia or at a museum if you need more information . " <p> Sy Barlowe is an expert at drawing animals , and one of his main sources of inspiration is the cave paintings of Lascaux and Altamira , which he feels are some of the most " spirited " animal paintings in existence . " These paintings are as fresh as any paintings that have been done in the twentieth century , " he says . He adds that these works support his claim that , in order to adequately represent an animal , an artist must know the creature extremely well . " In contemporary life , we do not have large amounts of time to observe animals as people did in those ancient times , " he says . " However , we can make up for this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help us express the spark that ignites our own inspiration . " <p> Dot and Sy Barlowe use similar techniques for making their illustrations . Both begin with a basic , preliminary sketch made on plain tracing paper , usually a 9 " - x- 12 " or 14 " - x- 17 " sheet . Another option for preliminary work is using a sheet of tracing vellum of similar size , although they usually use vellum not for thumbnails but for completed sketches because it has a harder , less resilient surface that can withstand physical abuse better than common tracing paper ; it also readily accepts ink . <p> Illustration board is utilized for the finished paintings because it is easy to handle and accepts a variety of mediums well . Says Dorothea , " We usually use gouache , which is very compatible with cold-pressed board . When we put down a wash , the board is porous enough to accept the wash of color without its lying on the surface and forming puddles . " The paints they use are Winsor &; Newton and Grumbacher gouache , usually in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Chinese orange , burnt sienna , cerulean blue , burnt umber , chromium oxide green , cobalt blue , olive green , sepia , turquoise blue , yellow ochre , raw sienna , and raw umber , as well as white and ivory black . Their preferred palettes are somewhat unconventional  --  plain white porcelain tile  --  since they feel plastic palettes tend to become stained . Their brushes are Winsor &; Newton Series 7 and Series 707 , which they favor in Nos. 00 , 0 , 1 , and 2 . <p> In doing your research , do not overlook the importance and beauty of plants in and of themselves . From the illustrations of Durer to those in horticultural magazines and other publications , there are numerous resources available to you . <p> In addition , of course , use anything you can find in your own garden , on the street , or in a park . The most important fact to keep in mind throughout your endeavors in painting nature is to consider the smallest objects that can be helpful in your research ; even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A gouache illustration of night creatures by Sy Barlowe , 10 3/8 x 19 , for Long Island Newsday . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Above : A gouache illustration of the bluefin tuna by Sy Barlowe , 9 x 21 1/4 , for the book series Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Left : A gouache illustration depicting ten species of toads by Sy Barlowe , 7 1/2 x 4 3/8 , for the Ampibians of North American ( Golden Press ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Top : A gouache illustration of sea plants by Sy Barlowe , 11 7/8 x 20 5/8 , for Long Island Newsday .
