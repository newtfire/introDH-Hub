Sm . For many years I have read the Nation for its judicial criticisms of public men and measures , and am sorry to conclude that , in the recent campaign and now , it is so partisan in its views and expressions that its judgments are unfair and unreliable . I voted for Cleveland on the tariff issue , and believe I should stand with him to-day if sustained by a party as sane and reliable as the Palmer and Buckner Democrats . In your editorial , " Apathy , " Of November 17 you seem not to imagine that an independent voter might prefer Roosevelt , proven to be honest , intelligent , and a true patriot , with a party back of him rational on nearly every important question except the tariff , to one for the time right on the tariff , but having in it a large minority  --  possibly more  --  represented by Bryan , Watson , Hill and that ilk , that would influence and might control it Roosevelt , trustworthy as mortal can be , sustained by the Conservative buSiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff  --  we think better than a party with some men right on the tariff , joined with an aggressive , perhaps controlling , element wrong on financial matters , and dangerous on almost all questions of law , morals , and government , and under suspicion of saying things not believed in , and putting forward candidates not representing them , and that might be unable to control them ? Respectfully , JNO . H. WARD LOUISVILLE , ICY , November 02 , 1004 We were , and are , very well aware that every thinking voter had to sum up for himself candidate , platform , and past history of each of the two great Parties before determining how to cast his vote Men feltthe same scruples about voting for Cleveland that our correspondent felt in the case of Parker . The difference in the two campaigns was one of warmth and earnestness ; the immediate subject of our article .

What we deplored was the lack of evidence at the polls that the present Administration 's acts in " questions of law , morals , and government " had the least reprobation , such as might have found expression in a diminished if sufficient Republican majority . We can at least congratulate our correspondent on having conquered his presumable ' Southern prejudices on account of Mr. Roosevelt 's offence against the spirit of caste. ? ED . NATION . THE GENOESE DIALECT . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR ? I have read with great interest your correspondent 's article on the Italian Dialects , but his statement as to there being no vocabulary of the Genoese does not seem to be quite exact , as may be seen from the following title : Casaccia , Vocabolario Genovese-Itahano , ' second edition , Genoa , 1873-76 .

For the sake of a dozen of the quatrains facing the drawings of Mr. Gilbert James . FitzGerald 's Omar is printed wholly on the left-hand page in the volume forming part of Messrs Routledge 's " Photogravure Series " ( New York : Dutton ) This is a little exasperating , and the drawings by no means restore one 's temper .

S Coburn , which shoan uncommon range of power from the weird and creepy to the beautiful . The shadowy designs often miss their force from lack of intelligibility , but the best of them are impressive , and the artist 's imagmatioseldom appears strained . C.

Mrs. Browning 's Sonnets from the Portuguese ' are once more luxuriously dressed in small quarto form , by the H M. Caldwell Co. , Boston . The verse is incased in a floriated border , all printed in uncompromising black , Morris fashion , but readable . The white and gold cover has been well conceived . The same firm sends us Tennyson 's ' Holy Grail , ' in which the tinted borders are of feeble phantasy and overpower the text . The binding is a flexible brown leather . Pleasing in every aspect is the little volume proceeding from the Scott-Thaw Co. , ' The Wisdom of Robert Louis Stevenson , ' collected and arranged from his writings . It is prettily framed and rubricated , and contains both a table of contents and an index . The limp covers are in crimson leather or leatherette .

Similar treatment has been accorded Paul Leicester Ford 's reissued ' Love Finds a Way , ' from the same publishers . Here Miss Armstrong 's borders are floral , bold and with good success , while Harrison Fisher supplies some wash drawings , less characteristic , but sufficient . Mrs Sally Pratt McLean Greene 's ' Cape Cod Folks ' has stood ' the weathering of nearly a quarter of a century , and is worthy of the extra pains bestowed upon the current edition bearing the imprint of De Wolfe , Fisk &; Co , Boston . The author 's portrait serves as frontispiece . The charm of the illustrations lies in the full-page and vignette views of actual Cape scenery . It was a pity to mix with these a few mediocre and inharmonious designs pertaining to the action of the story . Little , Brown &; Co. have reprinted Mathilde Blind 's Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with additional chapters on George Eliot 's work , her friends , etc. , and a complete bibliography by Frank Waldo and G. A. Turkington . Miss Blind 's account of the great novelist was felt to be an unsatisfactory one in 1883 , and it has not improved in the interval , in fact , its value has been impaired by later publications . It was , perhaps , hardly to be expected that the present editors could add anything new , either to the ascertained facts of George Eliot 's life , or to the considerable body of criticism oi her writings What they appear to have done is to gather into their supplementary chapters such illumination as could be extracted from Herbert Spencer 's autobiography and from the critical essays of Leslie Stephen , Henry James , and others They have fallen into one error which it seems worth while to correct .

After Mr. Crockett 's abridgment of Scott , Fielding 's ' Tom Jones ' is taken in hand for the " Condensed Classics " of Messrs . Holt . The reduction , less vital than in Scott 's case , has been performed by Mr. Burton E Stevenson , who has brought the story within 450 pages 16mo His object has been to prevent tedium , without affecting the course of the narrative , and also without Bowdlerizing . Mr. Ernest A. Vizetelly undertakes , in ' Emile Zola , Novelist and Reformer ' ( John Lane ) , an elaborate Vindication of the famous writer and energumcn . One may confess to some disappointment at discovering that the special pleading which characterizes the whole biography renders its author quite unable to estimate the sincerity of one chancing to hold divergent views concerning either the work or the public conduct of the unsparing satirist , who delivered his denunciations with possibly less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one since the days of Swift . The value of such literary criticisms as this volume contains may be gauged by the exalted place given to ' Le Docteur Pascal ' as the culminating effort of Zola 's genius In discussing ' L'Affaire , ' it never seems to occur to Mr. Vizetelly that public attacks on the judiciary are usually punishable in other countries beside France . Mr. Edward Marston , long known as a London publisher and an " Amateur Angler , " and later by his ' Sketches of Booksellers , ' has now dropped into informal autobiography in ' After Work ' ( Scribners ) . Entering the house of Sampson Low in 1846 , and becoming a partner ten years later , he kept recollections of Bulwer , Macaulay , Samuel Warren , G. P. R. James , and sundry other more or less notable persons . He has more to say of R D. Blackmore , who in the early sixties brought for publication a version of part of Virgil 's Georgics . The future novelist then , as later , looked the market-gardener ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The late G. A. Meaty " was a rough dianiond of the first water , hearty , sometimes boisterous , genial , generous , sympathetic , and simple-minded as a child . " Mr. Marston endeavors to account for the appearance of Sir Morell Mackenzie 's ' Frederick the Noble ' in the New York Herald and the London Standard two days before publication in book form , by supposing that the proof-sheets were stolen from the printers and cabled across A necessary index is not lacking . But for Elizabeth , Mrs. H. C. Eggar 's ' An Indian Garden ' ( James Pott &; Co ) would not have been or would have been other than it is The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wrath , " and the coolies of the German peasantry . Unfortunately , there are no children to replace the babies of the months  --  it is Anglo-India 's tragedy to be without children These garden books , written by ladies , have a charm of their own . A woman can not well write about the minutia of housekeeping  --  at all events women have not yet done so with acceptance ; but a garden gives them a kindred subject , ch'armingly suited to the display of the feminine point of view . An Indian garden of the plains is an unknown thing to most people  --  the names of its trees and plants connote little to us , yet this book can be read with pleasure , photographs , such as they are , helping the ordinary reader 's ill-equipped experience . There are nice dogs in it , and horrible snakes in plenty , tropical deluges of rain , and a sense of things growing apace . It is shade , rather than sunshine , that takes the prominent position . Steamy air , orchids , ferns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . Plenty of discursive interludes about odd characters save the horticulture from monotony , and there are not too many native words for the patience of a foreign reader . Why is it that California is so inspiring to writers of mountain , books ? There are many vaster mountain ranges . Great glaciers are not found there . California is not remarkable for the difficulty or excitement of its climbing . Yet , from Clarence King down , good books about mountaineering have been inspired in succession by the beautiful region in question . We hardly dare suggest that the reason may be found in the fact that what we may call the professional climber goes elsewhere , attracted by higher game . Clarence King , John Muir , and Stewart Edward White are not to be counted in the ordinary run of climbers . They belong to the larger body of nature-lovers . The last-mentioned , in his newly issued book , ' The Mountains ' ( McClure , Phillips &; Co. ) , certainly belongs to the Clarence King rather than the Whymper group of mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climber of hills . His adventures are those of the trail rather than of snowfield and crag . He introduces his readers to the forests , the streams , and the canons oftener than to peaks . Evidently he loves the upper forest region more than - the barren heights  --  his visits to the latter are brief He can write well of what be loves . He belongs to the Thoreau kindred in his attitude to nature and the Borrovian in his eye for men . The book is one to be thankful for . The " Langham Series of Art Monographs , " published in New York by Charles Scribner 's Sons , already numbers seven pocket volumes of from seventy to eighty-five small square pages each . The seventh volume is entitled simply ' Nuremberg , ' and is the work of Hermann Uhde-Bernays ; having the same character as its fellow-monographs , ' Venice as an Art City , ' ' London as an Art City , ' etc . Of a more general interest are the volumes on Bartolozzi and his English pupils , by Selwyn Brinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely . Lautrec , Morin , Forain , and Caren d'Ache  --  with others of ? their stripe . The second volume of the series deals with the color prints of Japan , and is by E. F. Strange , the keeper of prints in what was once the South Kensington Museum . Volume VIII . is to be an essay by Mr Brinton on ' The Eighteenth Century in English Caricature . ' Also , there are to be studies of single artists ; Auguste Rodin , the sculptor , has already been treated by Rudolf Dircks . Noticeable in the Nuremberg book is a very personal tone , altogether welcome to one who knows something of the subject already and is prepared to enjoy a fresh treatment of an old subject . The present essay is for all the world like what a series of private letters might be , and is on that account far more entertaining , and perhaps correspondingly more useful .

The problems set for practice are well within the range of a beginner 's skill , provided there be patience and the right spirit ; these simple tasks , if performed with a full understanding of the real teaching of the book , will carry the learner much farther toward true oraftsmanship than he may suspect . The book is not comprehensive , but rudimentary ; without grasp of the rudiments the artisan , however technically skilled by practice , will fall short or fail wholly . The precepts of this book , which show the workman in what way thoughts may best be moulded into things , are explicitly set forth in a few lines here and there , but are readable between all the lines by implication .

Among recent law books is an annotated edition of ' The National Bank Act , ' by John M. Gould ( Boston : Little , Brown &; Co ) . All the amendments are given , and explained as well as annotated It is pretty good proof of the careful drafting of the original act , now forty years old , that the number of decisions under it seems to be only seven or eight hundred There are , of course , still openings for doubts and possibilities of controversy , but the small amount of friction and confusion with which - the act has been in the main developed Is remarkable .

Both of these scholars have since died , and the second edition of their book , ' La latterature Compares Esse . Bibliographique ' ( Strassburg Karl J Trubner ) , has been entrusted to the care of M. Texte 's successor at Lyons , Prof. Fernand Baldensperger. - Many titles have been added , and new divisions appear , devoted to the Scandinavian and Slavic literatures , to the foreign influences on Amen-can literature , to the history of poetic themes and motives , etc The last of these is scarcely adequate , and the subject is still chiefly limited to Quellenforschung A subject-index replaces the old index of authors , but the adequacy of this addition may also be doubted , under the word " Scaliger , " for example , works on ' Dante and the Scaligeri ' and ' Opitz and J C Scaliger ' are alike referred to , and innumerable themes treated in the works listed in the body of the book are neglected when these themes do not appear in the titles of the works themselves This bibliography is a valuable aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of complete and fundamental revision .

This decision of Parliament and Government is the outcome of the agitation of the historian Blok The funds to conduct the institute for five years have been granted , and the purpose will be to make researches in the archives of Italy , especially for materials bearing on the history of the Netherlands . Dr Brom , a prominent Catholic savant of Utrecht , is entrusted with this work , as he has for years been studying the archives in Rome .

The recent utterance of the Kaiser to the effect that a school of seventy children in charge of a single master is a " Menschenqualerei , " has caused German educational journals to examine the statistics in the case . According to the reports published by Prussia in 1991 , there were no fewer than 949 schools in the kingdom with a contingent of from 71 to 100 children for a single master , 685 half-day schools reported 120 and more children ' Ed a single teacher , fully one-half of these being in the Polish provinces . In 5,048 schools with two or more teachers there was an enrolment of between 71 and 100 for each teacher ; in 89 schools with one teacher and in 415 schools with two or more teachers , each had charge of 121 to 150 pupils ; and in one school wrath one teacher and in two with more teachers the enrolment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published returns , it appears that 19,652 teachers , or fully 22 per cent . of the total corps , suffered from the affliction and injustice the Emperor condemns .

I feel so convinced that , in making any change in cataloguing , promptness is the only safe method . " A wise rule ! Mr Robert Steele continues his investigations as to " What Fifteenth-Century Books are About , " dealing this time with " Divinity .

" This paper is printed in full in the October number of the Library Association Record , which also contains the proceedings of the conference . The speaker regards conditions in schools and colleges as unfavorable to reading for other purposes than examinations There is too little time for " browsing among books , " too little reading for recreation , and too little time for thinking .

Much of this space might have been saved , and probably with advantage , if all biographies of the living ? an element of very uncertain value , and open to the suspicion of business influence ? had been excluded , and if far fewer photographs of synagogues and the like , mostly of depressing architecture , had been given .

Even higher interest will be raised by the article on Jesus of Nazareth The historical treatment has been put into the hands of Mr. Joseph Jacobs , who is a folk-lorist and miscellaneous editor . Of him here fewest words are best . Much more adequate is the theological treatment by Dr. Kaufmann Kohler , his position can be put in a word : Jesus was " the acme and the highest type of Essenism . " Jesus in Jewish legend is treated by Prof. S. Krauss of Budapest . The difficulty which this whole rubric must have offered can not be denied , but that the thirteen pages given here are an absolutely insufficient recognition of the one personality of the Jewish race which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race in general , and which , as all believe , bore a message equal in weight to that committed to any member of the whole human race , is staringly plain In the same volume the rubric Jeremiah  --  life , book , epistle  --  has twelve pages , and , if we add the separate article on Lamentations , has nearly fourteen  --  a page more . To turn to less contentious matter , Judah Haley 's , the singer of Zion , whom all know if only through Heine , is sympathetically and sufficiently portrayed The Kishinelf tragedy is rehearsed ; Judaism , from the- reformed point of ' view , has ten pages competently from Mr. Kohler  --  the conservative is to be given later under Religion , the Karaites are fittingly treated by ' Abraham de Harkavy . All these are subjects generally known .

We are here told of his Talmudic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to print it in 1750 , when he was seventy , and how the last sheet finally appeared in 1887 , 131 years after his death  --  a case surely unique even in the slow annals of bibliography . ? In volume viii . the most generally interesting article is probably that on London ? over twenty-three pages by Mr. Joseph Jacobs , here in his m  --  tier  --  with many illustrations and maps . Another is on Luria , the founder of the modern Cabala , but it fails to note the highly probable influence on him of ash-Sha'rani , the Muslim mystic , his somewhat older contemporary . Another deals with a singular difficulty which arises from the inflexible nature of Judaism . Where , for an orthodox Jew , does the dateline fall when he travels round the world ?

For a conscientious Jew that would be awkward , but , apparently , according to ' the decisions , he may have to guard himself by observing at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halevi , the poet , is an authority in the case , and the conception of Jerusalem as navel of the world is a starting-point This , without doubt , is a matter " full of seriousness , " as life was to the pugnacious Scotch dog , but only of a lighter humor is it that Daniel Mendoza , " the Star of Israel , " a pugilist of distinction , has his own mirthful seriousness for this book , and carries off full two-thirds of the space of Mene , Mene , ' Poked , Upharsin , beside which the ironic alphabet places him . It must be a misprint that metueates is said ( p 521 ) to be used " in Latin inscriptions by Juvenal for Jewish proselytes , " but the misprint is of an awkward kind , and the article does not tell where in Juvenal the expression occurs ?

The indebtedness of the English stage to its neighbors across the Channel no doubt helped to stifle originality . In comedy , as Prof A. W. Ward has shown ( English Dramatic Literature , ' vol. iii , 115 ) , the " lifting " was unscrupulous , and in 1718 Mrs. Centlivre could actually say , in the prologue to " A Bold Stroke for a Wife " : " To-night we come upon a bold Design , To try to please without one borrowed Line " And yet Some of the brightest scenes in her comedy were possibly recollections of Regnard 's ' Les Folios Amoureuses ' ( 1704 ) But conclusions as to the futility of transplantation should rest on some sounder basis than the evidence of translations executed chiefly by men of extremely mediocre aptitudes , and consequently incapable of rendering in English verse the stately measures of Corneille or Racine .

It is designed to appeal even more to the outside public , which , if it ever knew anything at all of the classics , has retained only a rather vague impression that Greek and Latin did it no harm By its choice of the Master of the Rolls as president , the Association emphasizes this aim . What the speakers at the Oxford meeting were inclined to dwell on was the practical value of a classical training . Professor Ramsay related that a land agent , a distinguished surgeon , and a general had all separately declared recently that " the resourcefulness and habit of accurate work , which they acquired in cultivating Latin verse , had proved of great use to them in the practical work of their lives , " while Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge related an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin had saved his country from grave international complications . There is something pathetic about all this . Lord Bowen said that classical scholars reminded him of a timid elderly traveller fussing over his luggage at a crowded railway station . But that jealous air of proprietorship is giving way to an almost too effusive eagerness to convince one 's fellow passengers that to travel without luggage as solid as one 's own is to court disaster The Association 's first enterprise will be to examine into the spelling of Latin in school and college text-books , with a view to establishing uniformity This has already been done to some extent in America The secretaries of the Association are Professors Postgate and Sonnenschein . ?

During the year which followed the institution of classes , thirty-one students attended the courses given by Mr Leadam and Mr Hall . In the year under review the numbers were well maintained , and the results seem to have been highly satisfactory .
