The boy came out of nowhere . One minute Reeve Stratton was standing on the narrow sidewalk of a street designed hundreds of years ago to handle only foot traffic and carts , and the next he was dashing between cars to snatch a small boy from the path of a speeding taxi . He yelled at the impatient cabbie , who sent him the universally recognized one-fingered response and roared off around the corner . " Whoa there , son , " Reeve said , hiding his disgust at the driver while trying to keep his voice light so the boy would n't panic at being grabbed by a stranger . " Better watch where you 're going . " He swung the boy around and set him down on the sidewalk before looking at him . When he did , he was met by the impish grin and sparkling brown eyes he 'd seen in many recent photographs . The boy 's expression told Reeve there was no need to worry about this kid panicking . He was Prince Jean Louis , the seven-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Inbourg . He and his mother were the ones Prince Michael had hired Reeve to protect . Reeve was n't supposed to start the job until that evening , but it seemed that fate had other ideas . Not that Reeve believed in fate - or coincidence , for that matter . " I was watching , " Jean Louis protested , pointing a sturdy arm up the street . " I was after that butterfly . It looked like one I saw in a book . It flew out of the park and I was going to catch it . " " You 'd be better off chasing butterflies in - " " Jean Louis ! " a frantic voice called , then a woman rushed up and pulled the little boy into her arms . Reeve had an impression of thick , red-gold hair , flashing gold bracelets and the scent of violets as the woman knelt before the boy and gave him a frantic examination . Finally she released a sigh , looked directly into Jean Louis 's face as she gripped his shoulders firmly and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't find you . I 've told you to never run off like that . " " I 'm okay , Mom , " the boy said with the put-upon tone of a long-suffering son . He flashed her a disarming grin . " I saw a blue butterfly and I chased it out of the park . " " And right into the path of a taxi , " Reeve interjected . She paled as she looked at her son and then at Reeve . Visibly shaken , she stammered , " I ... did n't see . He moved so fast ... Thank you for saving him . " Reeve nodded , studying her . He knew all about Anya Marietta Victoria of the House of Chastain and the Principality of Inbourg - and not merely from the press reports . Prince Michael had freely answered all Reeve 's questions about the princess . Also , the prince had a portrait of his three daughters displayed prominently in his office . Reeve did n't know about the other two princesses , but the artist had n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was something about her thick hair , the color of Black Hills gold , and her deep-green eyes that would have stopped traffic anywhere in the world . Combined with delicate features , full lips and flawless skin ... well , Reeve now understood why the tabloids were so obsessed with her . She was dressed in a simple beige sheath dress as if she wanted to blend into the crowd . Fat chance , he thought . Unreasonably annoyed , he frowned as he asked , " Do n't you watch your kid ? Where 's your bodyguard ? " he asked . His gaze swept the area , but he did n't see any burly men rushing to the rescue and looking contrite for having let the little prince get away from them . The panic in her eyes gave way to coolness as she stood up slowly and grasped her son 's hand firmly in hers . Reeve watched her face as she considered what to say . It was obvious that he knew who she was . She looked down her nose at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches shorter than he was . " Of course , but we hardly need one right here in Inbourg . I gave him an hour off , " she answered in a tone that clearly said it was none of his business . " He 's to pick us up shortly . " " I see . " Reeve gave her a long , slow appraisal just to see how she would react to it . " You might want to reconsider the policy of going around without a bodyguard . " Her lips pressed together and she seemed to be preparing a sharp answer when another woman hurried up to them . She was short and plump , and the exertion of running had her face bright red and her breath coming in gulps . " Your Highness , " she gasped , " is he okay ? Are you okay ? I 'm so sorry . He was right beside me , and then - " " He 's fine , Esther , " the princess answered in a soothing tone , though her annoyed gaze remained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire the strongly defined profile and the determined set of her jaw . " We need to return home . " " Oh , I see . All right , " her flustered companion answered . She took Jean Louis 's hand from Anya 's . " Let 's go , young man . I 'm going to talk to Guy Bernard about putting some kind of electronic device on you so I 'll know where you are at all times . " " Really ? " the boy asked , clearly intrigued by the idea . He gave her a sly grin . " Cool ! Does that mean I 'll know where you are at all times , too ? " " Absolutely not , " came the brisk answer . Princess Anya watched as the two of them hurried down the sidewalk in the direction of the car park . Reeve saw a slight frown crease her brow before she blanked her expression and looked back at him . She hitched the strap of her purse onto her shoulder and stood with her back very straight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr .... " " Reeve , Your Highness . Reeve Stratton . " She glanced up at the flat tone in his voice . " Well , thank you , Mr. Stratton . " She reached into her purse , removed a card and a slim gold pen , and wrote something with a quick flourish . " If there 's ever anything I can do for you , please call this number and my secretary , Melina , will arrange it . " Reeve took the card , read the number written there and then tilted his head curiously . " What kinds of things does she arrange for you ? " The princess had been in the act of turning away , but now she glanced back at him , her green eyes sweeping him from head to toe and back again . " I beg your pardon ? " Reeve had to admit that the royally freezing look she turned on him could be very effective . But he 'd had worse thrown his way . Much worse . " I 'm just wondering how much she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's life worth ? " She stared at him . " What ? " Good , he thought . He had her attention . He lifted the card , holding it between his first two fingers . " This seems like an easy way to pay someone back for your son 's life , but what if I had n't been there ? " The annoyed flush drained from her face , leaving her starkly pale . When she spoke , her voice was barely above a whisper . " But you were there , and you saved his life . Thank you . " " But it would n't have been necessary if your bodyguard had been with you , Your Highness , " he said . He knew he was being hard on her , but this was his job now and Prince Michael was paying him extremely well to make sure he did it right . " Mr. Stratton , I hardly need advice from a stranger . From your accent , I can tell you 're an American , not even a citizen of Inbourg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And furthermore - " " Princess Anya , is this a new boyfriend ? " a voice broke in . " Look this way , will ya ? " The click and whir of a camera punctuated the tension between Reeve and Anya . Reeve saw her jaw clench and dread flash in her eyes before she turned to glare at the photographer . The photographer loved that , quickly snapping more pictures of the displeased princess . With barely a thought , Reeve wrapped his hand around her arm and pulled her behind him as he reached out with his other hand to place his palm over the camera lens . Behind him , he could feel that she was holding her body stiffly away from him . Good , he thought , at least she had some self-protective instincts . Too bad she did n't aim them in the right direction . ( Continues ... )
