In this article the author explores the ways in which the media articulate discursive structure and lived experience through an analysis of the coverage of the 1999 Israeli national elections in one Israeli newspaper . Recent changes in Israeli electoral law unleashed new social forces that granted major political influence to ethnic parties . The renewed salience of ( Jewish ) ethnicity clashes , however , with dominant discourses of national identity , according to which a unitary Israeli identity subsumes particularistic Jewish ethnicities , while silencing Palestinian identity . Such changes imply an important role for the Israeli media , which has traditionally marked identity difference through distinct regimes for the expression and control of affect . The author examines constructions of affect , and their inscription onto particular social identities , in Yediot Ahronot , Israel 's widest-circulation daily . <p> Israel ; elections ; Shas ; media ; ideology <p> The increasing presence of broadcast and print media in our everyday lives compels students of discourse to develop correspondingly sophisticated methods for evaluating its impact . In particular , the packaging of information as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes increasingly global and interconnected ( Friedman 1999 ; Appadurai 1990 ) . In a trenchant series of publications the Dutch linguist Teun van Dijk ( for example . 1991 ) has explored the role of news in perpetuating racism and prejudice . Summarizing findings for modem industrial societies , such as the U.S. and U.K. , van Dijk writes : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Van Dijk argues that the media plays a complex role in the production and reproduction of prejudice . When people refer to media images to " substantiate " the prejudices they express in everyday talk , they are completing a cycle , for van Dijk also argues that it is essentially the media that creates the link between minority ethnic groups and ( here ) crime in the first place . Van Dijk points out , for example , that while most Whites in Britain ( or the U.S. ) will feel this link , very few have actually experienced it . For such a notion to be shared by so many , it must have been spread by the media ( 1989 : 200 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understanding of the physical , social , and moral world they live in , we must understand not just how the news is produced , but also how it is interpreted . Recent work in anthropology and linguistics has greatly improved our analysis of interpretation by showing that meaning is both contextual ( cf. Goffman 1972 ; Duranti and Goodwin 1992 ) and interactional ( cf. Schegloff 1981 ) . <p> Meaning is contextual in that language takes on specific reference only with respect to the context in which it is uttered ( and interpreted ) . Words like " we " depend for their reference on who is speaking , just as core cultural concepts , like " nation , " depend for their meaning on who is being spoken of . Meaning is interactional in the sense that parties to a conversation ' may bring to their interaction different ideas about what concepts mean - leading in some cases to misunderstanding , but in other ( more interesting ) cases to negotiations over meaning . <p> By providing an ethnography of interpretive practices , the articles in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constituent notion of interpretation . In this article I argue that a full understanding of discourse requires an analysis of the ways that production and interpretation arc interdependent . Such a position builds upon the theoretical work of such scholars as Charles Peircc , Mikhail Bakhtin . Roland Barthes , and Pierre Bourdieu to claim that meaning is an infinite and recursive chain of negotiations , in which various forms of mediation play a crucial role . <p> Studying the interpretation of news is therefore tantamount to studying the interpretation of an interpreiation . Analysis of such recursive processes necessarily proceeds nutward in all directions from a particular starting point . In actual conversations , for example , interlocutors deploy symbols they glean from public discourse ( media ) . These images themselves stand in dialogic relationship to series of other , intcrtcxtually related images . Yet in conversation particular meanings may be emphasized . And these emphases are - through the abstract but very familiar processes we describe as " the market " and " opinion polls " - rcincorporated into public ( media ) discourses . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Israel . Specifically , I look at how newspaper coverage of an ethnic political party hegemonically reproduces ideologically dominant representations of identity . I begin , however , by showing how such mediation becomes a resource for negotiations of status and prestige in everyday conversation . Media Images of Identity in Conversation <p> It was a slip-of-the-tongue . I was interviewing two Israeli women - whom I 'll call Haya and Nurit - at Nurit 's home. 2 The women were talking about their memories of childhood and about learning pop songs as kids . Then the conversation turned to the Eurovision Song Competition that they - along with most Israelis - had watched on television a few months before. 3 Haya inadvertently referred to one of the singers as " Nurit Ben . " She meant to say " Zehava Ben , " the singer 's actual name , but she substituted " Nurit , " her friend 's first name , thereby condensing the two identities . As Sigmund Freud has pointed out , slips-of-the-tongue may be lessthan-innocent , ' and in this case a rich interpretation presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires some background on Israeli cultural politics . In the early 1990s Zehava Ben was one of the most popular singers in Israel , selling more tapes , records , and CDs than almost any other performer . Her popularity , however , was sharply divided along lines of social identity . Ben 's songs belong to the genre of Israeli pop music called muzika mizrahit ( literally " oriental music " ) , which draws on Arab rhythms , melodies , and styles. 5 While muzika muzrahit was enormously popular among Mizrahim. or Jews whose families had come to Israel from Arab and Middle Eastern countries , 6 most Ashkenazim , or Jews of European heritage , aclively disliked the style . <p> Musical tastes arc part of an elaborate hierarchy of symbolic capital ( cf. Bourdieu 1984 ) that represents and reinforces the social divisions in Israeli society . The three main social groups - Ashkenuzi Jews , Mizrahi Jews , and Palestinian Arabs 7 - cleave along two simultaneous dimensions of social difference : the dimension of religion/nationality , and the dimension of socio-economic class . While Mizrahim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working- ) class position with Palestinians . Mizrahim thus occupy an intermediate position between the unambiguously elite Ashkenazim and the clearly subaltern Palestinians. 8 <p> Reluming to the interview , then , we can see that Haya 's slip-of-the-tongue expressed indirectly what would have been awkward for her to express directly , namely that she sees Nurit as the " other " kind of Israeli . Indeed , the two women do come from diametrically opposed backgrounds . While Haya 's parents left Poland to come to Palestine in the 1930s , Nurit 's family came to Israel from Morocco in the 1950s - after Israel had already gained its independence . While Haya grew up in the elite environment of a Kibbutz. 9 Nurit grew up in the poverty of immigrant slums . In their conversation Haya 's slip-of-the-tongue shows that she sees her friend , Nurit , primarily as a Mizrahi woman - so much so that she subconsciously identifies her with the public-culture symbol of Mizruhi identity , the singer Zehava Ben . The conversation unfolded as a negotiation of identity , as each laid claim to core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlocutor . Within this negotiation Haya 's deployment of a prominent and polyvocal media image asserts more about status , role , and identity than she can comfortably say . Images of Ethnicity in the Press <p> Haya 's slip-of-the-tongue shows how public discourse crystallines and transforms representations of Self and Other into images made available for deployment in everyday conversations . The slip reveals something about her interpretation both of media discourse and of her relationship with Nurit . Examination of the coverage of the Eurovision competition , however , reveals a great deal about interpretive practices of the media . <p> Zehava Ben 's appearance in the 1992 Eurovision preliminary competition turned into a disaster . Going into the competition . Ben 's mass popularity made her a likely favorite , hut her song placed dead last among the twelve entries . The winning song was musically mainstream and ideologically Ashkenazi ( as were most of the other entries ) . 10 Her proposal that a muzika mizrahit song represent Israel to the European community challenged dominant ideas about what constitutes Israeli selfhood - and was dramatically rejected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedding the image of the rejected Other ( Ben and muzika mizrahit , for example ) in a collage of rejected behaviors ( emotionality and violence , for example ) . The next day Israel 's largest newspaper , Yediot Ahronot , 11 covered Ben 's appearance - and her shocking failure - in splashy detail . Celebratory images of the victorious singing group were juxtaposed against angry images of Ben . Yediot 's coverage framed Zehava Ben as a poor loser , and emotion was a key signifier in this framing . Ben was pictured displaying great emotion by crying over her loss . She was quoted expressing great emotion by complaining of ethnic bias in the judging of the songs . And her supporters were shown gushing great emotion as they reacted with violent words and threats of violent actions . <p> This very emotionality challenges dominant notions of the ideal Israeli Self , which is characterized by emotions ( hat are rational , controlled , and interior . The classic symbol for this image of the Israeli Self is the sabru. which refers literally to the fruit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphorical connection highlights the centrality of emotion : the sabra fruit - like the native/ideal Israeli - is said to be soft and sweet on the inside but rough and thorny on the outside . <p> Against this image of Self , cultural Others are constructed as violating the ideal of emotional control . Palestinians , for example , are prominently represented either as violent and irrationally emotional ( typified by the image of the terrorist ) or as sensual and familial ( typified by the image of the harem ) . But emotion is also used to distinguish among Jewish Israelis . Israeli public culture thus represents the Mizrahi as an Arab-Jew , an internal Other , that mediates between the Arabness of Palestinians and the Israeliness of European Jews . Ella Shohat , for example , has argued that Israeli movies have tended to cast Mizrahim as primitive characters - violent , emotional and traditional ( Shohat 1989 ) . And in other work I have argued that newspapers reproduce this pattern by representing Jewish violence - such as rioling - as linked to Mizrahi , rather than Ashkenazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurovision contest provided a set of highly condensed symbols for Israeli identity - affirming the Western-oriented . Ashkenazi Self ( through its selection of the winning song ) , while dramatically rejecting a Middle-Eastern oriented , Mizrahi Other ( through its rejection of Zehava Ben 's song ) . Zehava Ben 's failure became a dramatic representation both of cultural hegemony and of social alienation. 13 Ethnicity . Politics , and the Press in Israel <p> In this context the emergence - and meteoric rise to political power - of a Mizrahi political party , is of great interest . In what follows I will show how newspaper coverage of the Shas party reproduces stereotypical representations of the Mizrahi Other and legitimates dominant tropes of Israeli identity . Emergence of Shas <p> The Shas political party 14 represents the Mizrahi ultra-orthodox Jewish community . It is remarkable neither because it is an ethnic party - many have emerged - nor because it is a religious party - there have always been several . Rather , it is unprecedented in both regards because it has been so enormously successful . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel , 15 broke away from the Ashkenazi ultra-orthodox political establishment to form his own movement ( Peled 1998 ) . That year , running in their first elections , Shas won four seats ( out of 120 ) in the Knesset , the Israeli parliament . Since then , Shas 's representation in the Knesset has grown dramatically , as Figure 1 shows . In the most recent elections , in 1999 . Shas garnered 17 seats , and . as Figure 2 shows . Shas now constitutes a third major party . For decades Israel has had a two-party system , in which Labor 16 and Likud were the two large parties . Shas has thus significantly transformed the Israeli political system ( ut least temporarily ) by shifting it to a three-party system . <p> The extraordinary strength of Shas has also completely changed the role of religious parties in Israeli politics . Orthodox religious movements have played an important role in Israeli politics since the very first Israeli elections in 1948 . In earlier elections the religious party representation in parliament had been consistent but small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious panics had been content to join any governing coalition , playing little role in the policy debates , hut laying claim to religious matters , issues of family law , and ( considerable ) funding for religious institutions and schools . This pattern was already changing , however , in the early 1980s , when Ovadia Yosef created Shas . The ultra-orthodox religious parties , headed by Agudat Israel , were becoming much more involved in a broader range of policy issues , developing a rightwing leaning . At the same time , the National Religious Party ( NRP ) . a religious but non-orthodox party , was becoming closely tied to the settler movements in the West Bank and Gaza - and there-fore even more tied to right-wing politics ( cf. Cohen and Susser 2000 ) . Thus when Yosef and the Mizrahi orthodox leadership broke away in 1984. they helped set in motion a major political realignment . <p> Yet it is important to view Shas in ethnic , as well as religious terms . Ethnic parties have emerged from time to time in Israeli political history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shas . Palestinian ( Israeli ) political expression , for example , has long been channelled through the communist party , which was an Arab/Jewish party , while nationalist Arab parties have been repressed when they emerged in the past . Nor have Jewish ethnic parties fared well in Israeli elections , in large part because " major efforts at delegitimizing ethnic political organizations were undertaken by the dominant Ashkenazi institutions " ( Peled 1998 : 714 ) . The success of Shas ( as an ethnic party ) parallels the success of Natan Sharansky 's Russian immigrant party , Israel B'Aliya , and of Azmi Bishara 's unprecedented run in 1999 as a Palestinian candidate for Israeli Prime Minister . The newfound acceptability and influence of Russian , Palestinian , and Mizrahi parties signifies a major change in Israeli political discourse . Newspaper Coverage of Shas <p> Their newfound political power put Shas - and therefore Mizrahi identity also - in an intense media spotlight . This spotlight was enlarged by the important elections of 1999 , hut also by a scries of four media crises that received special attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political leader and a cabinet Minister , was convicted of accepting bribes ; in June Shas held up formation of a new government ( after the 1999 elections ) by wrangling over cabinet positions ; in August Shas delayed transportation of an electric power generator because it would violate the Jewish Sabbath ; and in September Shas leadership struggles threatened to tear the party apart . <p> During each of these crises Shas made front-page , headline news , and each crisis was covered in excruciating detail . Since much of the coverage involved stories about crime and corruption ( including a long-running investigation into improprieties in the handling of government funds for Shas schools ) , Shas was frequently presented in a negative light . A survey of the coverage in Yeaiol Ahronot . Israel 's largest newspaper , however , shows more specifically that the coverage of Shas reproduced stereotypical images of Mizrahim as quintessentiall Other , as criminal , violent , and emotional , and as povertystricken and backward . " <p> Yediot 's coverage of the Den verdict on April 16 visually constructs difference and opposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 3 . This figure shows the left-most portion of a banner header spanning the top of the first of two two-page spreads devoted to the Dcri story ( that is. pages 2-3 of the issue ) . " The banner visually identifies the two-page spreads , linking the articles together into a coherent story . In Figure 3 we see a picture of Deri on the left , and on the right a picture of one of the Supreme Court justices who delivered the guilty verdict . Next to Deri is the banner 's title for the spread : " 4 Years in Jail : The Verdict . " Between Deri and the justice is an excerpt from the court 's decision . " <p> The visual narrative of opposition is constructed in part through the juxtaposition of photographic images . As can be seen in Figure 3 , the banner header shows Deri looking across toward the justice , and the justice 's face is positioned so that she too seems to be looking toward Deri . The rest of the banner ( not shown in Figure 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court justices is pictured gazing across at Deri . At the right edge of the banner is a second picture of Deri. in which he is facing the same direction as the three judges - as if gazing back toward himself. 20 Immediately below this banner header , on the left side of the spread , is a much larger picture of Deri , in which he is gazing upwards , again facing the three judges . Deri is thus shown left , right , and below the three judges , framing their faces - and words . <p> The visual and spatial deployment of text also plays an important role in constructing this opposition . Four short excerpts from the judicial opinion arc included in the banner header , bach excerpt appears in a large headline font , under quotation marks , beneath an underlined heading . One excerpt is printed to the left of each judge 's picture , and the fourth excerpt appears to the left of the ( second ) picture of Dcri . The juxtaposition of the judges ' pictures ( with their names printed below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the words arc attributed to the individual judges . In fact , however , the texts are taken from the decision . This becomes clear from the fact that one such excerpt is placed next to the picture of Deri , the defendant . <p> The titles given to the excerpts augment the quotative effect of the visual juxtaposition : while the segments alongside the judges ' pictures have the titles " The Seriousness of the Offense , " " The Precedent , " and " The Essence of the Bribery , " the segment next to Deri himself bears the title " The Personal Responsibility . " While the judges individually and collectively stale the facts , Deri is made to " speak " about personal responsibility . <p> If the first spread in the April 16 issue visually constructs the notions of opposition , conflict , tension , and guilt , the second spread uses visual imagery to represent Shas adherents as emotional. 21 Figure 4 shows the large set of photographs immediately below the banner header on the second spread ( that is , pages 4-5 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacting to news of the verdict . All three pictures show orthodox religious Jewish men ( identifiable from their head-coverings and beards ) , and all three pictures depict men in the act of extreme emotional display . In one picture a man appears to be crying , and in the other two pictures men are yelling - mouths wide open , eyes squinting with intensity . The vehemence of the latter men 's silent screams leaps out from the page directly at the reader . <p> Much of the Shas coverage when not devoted to one of the four major crises , such as the Den verdict , involved either the elections or controversies over government funding for Shas ( religious ) schools . In both cases , coverage of Shas represented Mizrahim in stereotypical ways by linking the news to poverty . In Israel , as in the U.S. , explicit reference to ethnicity is rare almost taboo - in many conversational and media genres , but implicit reference to identity through proxies is abundant. 22 In the early 1990s , for example . American media discourses indexed African-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cf. Mendelberg 1997 ) . Similarly , Israeli media have long indexed Mizrahi identity through proxy topics , such as poverty , educational failure , and development towns . The indexicality stems from the fact that Mizrahim earn less money and fewer academic degrees than do Ashkenazim , and that during the 1950s they were systematically settled in geographically marginal frontier settlements called " development towns " ( Swirski 1989 ) . 23 <p> Yediot 's coverage of the 1999 election results , for example , link Shas ' success to the issue of poverty . A May 21 article reads : " In 30 Settlements Shas is the Strongest Party . " 24 The settlements listed are all development towns - well known to combine high proportions of Mizrahi residents and high poverty rates . What is interesting , though , is the apparent newsworthiness of this story : Shas garnered about 15 percent of the national vote , only 1-2 percentage points fewer than did Likud ( see Figure 2 ) . Therefore , it should not be significantly more newsworthy for Shas to be the majority party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shas ' success in these settlements stands in sharp contrast to the lack of comparable stories about settlements where the other two large panics - either Likud or One Israel ( that is , Labor ) - were dominant . <p> Coverage in Yediot Ahronot of the long , simmering controversy over government funding for Shas schools also stereotypically represents Mizrahim as poverty-stricken . In July , 1999 , reports surfaced of financial irregularities in a network of schools run by Shas. 25 From there the thread moved first to stories showing that Shas schools provide inferior education , and then to the poverty of families who send their children to Shas schools . In the July 23 issue , for example , articles focus on parents ' reasons for electing to send their children to Shas religious schools , rather than to other ( government ) schools . The conclusion this thread reaches is poverty : parents claim that they are too poor to afford the costs of the public , state-run , secular schools . Such articles contest the potential interpretation that rapid growth in Shas school enrollments is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parents send their children to Shas schools out of more pedestrian motivations . <p> Finally , throughout the summer and fall of 1999 newspaper coverage of issues related to religious observance facilitated a stereotypical representation of Shas as traditional , backward , and primitive . Specifically , the media focused a critical lens on the role that religious leaders ( rabbis ) play in Shas decision-making . Such coverage highlights Shas as a " religious " party , and inserts it into the virulent religious-secular struggle in Israel . <p> In early August , for example , the crisis over transporting an electric power generating turbine broke out . Authorities suggested moving the turbine - so large and heavy that transporting it would stop traffic along a congested highway for hours - on a Saturday , the Jewish Sabbath , when few Israelis drive . The authorities aimed to minimize disruption to traffic and business , but Shas objected on the grounds that doing this work on a Saturday would violate the work prohibition on the Jewish Sabbath . Shas spokesmen presented the party as taking an unpopular and impractical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage subverted this representation by presenting Shas as hypocritical , corrupt , and backward . This discursive construction is achieved by representing Shas political leaders as controlled by behind-the-scenes ( and unelected ) religious leaders , by portraying the Rabbis as old and feeble , and by focusing on the pettiness of factional struggles within Shas . <p> Pictures of Shas leaders and activists are marked for religious identity because the figures themselves wear the hats , black suits , and full beards associated with Orthodox Jewish men ( see Figure 4 ) . The proliferation of discourse about religion , however , can be seen in the prominence of the religious leaders , especially Rabbi Ovadia Yosef , who is usually identified as the " spiritual leader of the Shas movement . " Articles that discuss Shas politics often focus on the apparent dependence of Shas politicians on their rabbinic sponsors . Figure 5 , for example , shows a portion of the 1999 election coverage from the June 25 issue of Yediot Ahronot . Articles discussing the election results are set off by a banner headline entitled " Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The spread is framed by large pictures of three very old rabbis with enormous white beards . The image of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri ( upper left ) is especially striking , since he appears feeble , walking with a cane , and wearing a head-covering that recalls the Ottoman tarbush. 26 In other cases , articles about politics often are accompanied by pictures showing politicians visiting , or studying , praying , or conferring with these senior rabbis . <p> The " Turbine Crisis " thread evolved into a " Shas Factionalism Crisis " thread . Articles repeatedly analyze the ' Turbine ' issue as an artificial conflict having little to do with religion , religious principles , or national welfare . Rather , the Israeli nation ( and pursuit of commerce ) is represented as hostage to whimsical and petty rivalries between ancient rabbis and their quisling politicians . Figure 6 , for example , shows pan of the July 30 issue 's coverage . Here the spread of articles is framed by the title " Earthquake in the Orthodox World , " and we see large photographs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other over their long white beards. 27 The newspaper representation makes the conflict look petty , trivial , almost childish . Ethnicity , Politics , and Discourses of Nation <p> Mainstream media representations of Shas recapitulate earlier tropes of Mizrahi identity , representing Shas politicians and supporters as emotional , violent , irrational , and primitive . At the time when Shas ' electoral gains threatened to give Mizrahim real political power , media representations tended to subvert this possibility through discourses that repositioned Shas - and thereby Mizrahim - onto delegitimized images . The efficacy of these discourses to re-position Shas stems , I would argue , from its success in reconfiguring the religious/secular cleavage in Israeli Jewish society . The focus on Shas reinscribed religious orthodoxy onto Mizrahi , rather than Ashkenazi , identity . <p> The rise of Shas has dramatically shifted the anti-religious discourse to one focused on Mizrahi , rather than Ashkenazi , ultra-orthodox organizations and symbols . Israeli discourse has expressed discomfort with the growth in popularity ( and influence ) of Ashkenazi fundamentalism , because it conflicts with core Zionist and Western ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of the Ashkenazi ultra-orthodox parties . An old and feeble Ashkenazi rabbi would be shown on election day making a speech to direct his followers how to vole And an especially corpulent ultra-orthodox Knesset member was often photographed from below , looking up , so that his belly was foreshortened and exaggerated , highlighting his absurd physical proportions . <p> The " sephardization " of Jewish fundamentalism , however , fits comfortably within broader Israeli nationalist discourses , which oppose the Western orientation of Israel to its Eastern geography , and which use the position of the Mizrahi " Arab-Jew " to mediate between the inherently Western Ashkenazi and the unalterably Eastern Arab ( cf. Shohat 1989 ) . For by telling the " Story of Shas " newspapers are reformulating the recent history of Israeli politics in general . The story of Shas resolves into a foil for the narrative of Israeli political and social progress . <p> In the early 1990s the mainstream parties - Labor and Likud - switched to a " primary " system for electing its leadership . The new Israeli " primaries " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English word " primaries " to describe it . The impact of this innovation was dramatic . The Labor party adopted a primary system in time for the 1992 elections , while the Likud continued its older method of choosing its leaders . Labor 's primaries helped them project a positive image as a progressive and modern party . In sharp contrast , the Likud suffered through a particularly nasty leadership struggle , appearing backward , corrupt , and absurd in its internal factionalization and behind-the-scenes bargaining. 28 Following the victory of the Labor candidate . Yitzhak Rabin , in the 1992 elections , the Likud quickly followed suit , adopting a primary system in time for the next election . <p> Thus , current Shas politics , which are portrayed so negatively in the press , merely recall a political style that used to be mainstream . In the constant shifting of symbolic capital , dominant groups have re-defined the symbols , and the new terms are used to disparage newcomers to the political arena . <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
