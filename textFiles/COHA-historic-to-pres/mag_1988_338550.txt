A messenger unaware , the pith-helmeted colored , or mixed-race , mailman pedaled his bicycle past the bougainvillea that lined the quiet suburban street . He stopped and rang the bell at the home of a theology professor at South Africa 's Stellenbosch University . A tall , stoop-shouldered man came to the door . Curious , then amazed , the mailman watched the professor open the envelope , read the brief message and suddenly begin weeping . The mailman had no way of knowing they were tears of joy . <P> The year was 1981 , and the telegram said , " You are called to Mamelodi parish . " To the professor , Nico Smith , it meant a complete change in his life , a rejection , in fact , of everything that his life had been until then and everything fundamental in Afrikaner society and Afrikaner belief . <P> Mamelodi is a black township of more than 300,000 on the outskirts of Pretoria . At Smith 's request , not only was he about to become its white minister , but also he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Afrikaners , among whom Smith had spent his whole life , have a harsh word for behavior like that : Kwaardwilligverlating , meaning , literally , " malevolent parting . " Says Smith : " It is n't just a divorce . It means you leave someone with the intention of destroying them . You become an enemy . " <P> Smith , 59 , is by now fairly well accustomed to being treated as an enemy . No Pretoria parish in the Dutch Reformed Church has invited him to speak since he went to Mamelodi . People he thought were friends have turned away . There are telephone calls in the night . " Now that you 're living with the Kaffirs , " said one caller , " when we come to shoot them , we 'll shoot you too . " <P> Last year Smith 's niece heard two men talking about him in her office . One said Smith " should be stopped . " The other asked the first what he would do if he suddenly met Smith . " I 'd take out my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And they are Christians , " Smith observes wryly after recounting this story . " Do you know that 78% of the people in this country are Christians ? " <P> There are times when the national sickness of racial hostility becomes almost unbearable . One night Smith heard the roar of cars racing past his house , the squeal of tires , then the rattle of gunfire and an explosion . Sometime later the phone rang , and the black woman on the line sounded on the edge of hysteria . She and her husband were known as antiapartheid activists . Their house had just been fire-bombed , and two of her sister 's children had been badly burned . <P> After trying to comfort the woman on the phone , Smith began calling elsewhere to get help , then went to visit the charred wreckage of the house . Somebody had thrown a whiskey bottle full of gasoline into the living room . Another bottle landed in the tiny bedroom where the nine-year-old girl and six-year-old boy lay sleeping with others . One of them was splashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her flesh , " said their aunt , Nomsameli Molefe , her own burned arm in a bandage . " The other child caught it mostly in the face .
