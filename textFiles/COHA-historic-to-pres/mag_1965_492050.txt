If you have , you 're part of a select audience that includes David Susskind , Joseph E. Levine and others involved in the $650,000 show that died after a single night on Broadway . The backstage story of this record theatrical rhubarb was recorded for The Post just as it happened , scene by scene . PROLOGUE The musical comedy KELLY opened at the Broadhurst Theatre on Saturday , February 6 . The New York drama critics unanimously condemned it as one of the worst musicals they had MT seen . Walter Kerr , writing in the NeW York HERALD TRIBUNE . spoke of it as " a bad idea gone wrong . " Howard Taubman , the critic for TliE NER YORK TIMES , called it " wooden and hollow ... without freshness or imagination . " It closed after a single performance , costing the investors roughly $650.000 . Nobody on Broadway could remember such a spectacular disaster within the recent history of the theater . On Monday , February 8 , the morning of the play 's collapse , David Susskind. the television impresario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to newspaper reporters of his grief . To the New York HERALD TRIBUNE . he said , in part : " I hare never been so shocked , so surprised in my life . I believed in KELLY I believed in the cast . I believed in the staging ... the songs . Then I saw the reviews . They raised a huge unanswered question mark in my brain . What happened to my taste ? Did I put on something crass ? Could I be this wrong ? " Such a confession would have seemed improbable to him in October 1964 , when , prior to the first rehearsals , Susskind 's press agent came to THE SATURDAY Y EVENING POST With a proposition for an article about the making of a Broadway musical . The press agent , Jack Perlis , announced that Susskind would welcome the presence of a writer during all phases of the production , No producer had ever before suggested such a thing , Perlis said , but no producer had as much courage as Susskind . Considered in retrospect , the events leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic form that divides , without any pedantic unities , into four acts . ACT I THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE , SUNDAY , OCTOBER 25. 1964 , EARLY AFTERNOON . S een from a distance . in the clear light of an unseasonably warm afternoon , the men and women grouped on the pedestrian walk of the Brooklyn Bndge seemed as luminous as figures in a Renoir painting . The chorus girls , dressed in costumes of the MO's. carried parasols . The men in striped blazers and derby hats had brought picnic baskets and mugs of beer . They stood in a small circle , listening to a trombone player try the opening bars of a tune called , Everyone Here Loves Kelly , When he had got it right . the girls put aside their parasols and danced , kicking their legs high in the air . The press agents , who had arranged the entertainment for the benefit of newspaper photographers , then began to push everybody else out of the way . " Behind the cameras , please . " they said , " everybody behind the cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alligator shoes and a dark silk suit . smiled fondly at the dancing , pleased that he had managed to borrow the Brooklyn Bridge for a publicity stunt on behalf of his new play . Derived from the legendary exploit of Steve Brodie , the play was about a young man who jumps off the bridge around the turn of the century . " Showmanship . " Levine said , watching some bewildered pedestrians walking across to Flatbush . " This is what I call showmanship . " Levine had been brought into the venture by David Susskind and Daniel Melnick , Susskind 's partner in his television enterprises , and between them they had raised $450,000 for the play 's production , a sum they then thought adequate to the purpose . Of that original money Levine put up $250,000 ; Susskind and Melnick persuaded a small group of investors to put up another $150,000 ; and Columbia Records , in return for rights to the record album , had advanced $50,000 . None of the PHOTOGRAPHS BY HENRY GROSSMAN producing partners had ever before attempted a Broadway musical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls put on fur coats , and everybody went back to the yellow tent set up on a traffic island at the Manhattan end of the bridge . The press agents , among them Jack Perlis , encouraged any stragglers with promises of more music and beer . " Titans , " Perlis said , speaking of Susskind and Levine. " these men are titans. giants of the entertainment industry , the Bamums of today . Whatever they do , they do big . I promise big action . " THE AMSTERDAM ROOF SIX WEEKS LATER . The first rehearsals took place in an old theater on the seventh floor of the New Amsterdam movie house at Broadway and 42nd Street . Drafty and dimly lighted , the theater had once been used by Florenz Ziegfeld for some of his smaller productions , Herbert Ross , the director and choreographer , sat in a KELLY wooden chair placed on an old burlesque runway . A tall , lean , awkward and flatfooted man , he sat with his right leg folded under his left , wearing a loose sweater and steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of television shows and Broadway musicals . Kelly was the first musical that he had ever directed . During those first weeks . gradually giving substance to his visions of space and movement , he seldom raised his voice , preferring to speak to the company with tight sarcasm . His horn-rimmed glasses and the deep lines in his gentle face gave him the appearance of a university professor . " You 're doing this like a bunch of drunken old ladies , for heaven 's sake , " he would say to the dancers ; or , " Do n't just sit there like an Equity member . Leslie , react . " Other than Ross 's bored , calm voice , the only sound in the theater was that of the rehearsal pianist playing the same tunes over and over again on the upright piano to the left of the stage , and the dancers counting to themselves as they waited to make their entrances . The girls wore their long hair pinned up in brightly colored scarves . Moose Charlap and Eddie Lawrence attended every rehearsal , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching their play from different angles . They had written Kelly five years before , in nine days and nine nights of fierce inspiration . They had been unable to get it performed , however , because the producers to whom they brought it had wanted to make unacceptable changes in the script . Conceived as an ironic farce , the play concerned a young Irish immigrant ( Hop Kelly ) who , before the opening curtain , has tried and failed in three attempts to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge . The action takes place along the Bowery during the late 1880 's . A sarcastic and cocksure youth . Kelly had offered to jump from the bridge in a moment of braggadocio . A group of gamblers took him up on the offer and squandered large amounts of money on his three losses of nerve . As the play opens the gamblers are ready to bet on him once again , but this time , to insure their investment , they intend to make him party to a fraud , by meansof a complicated scheme to throw a dummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Kelly sings a soliloquy in which he reveals hope of regaining self-respect by honestly risking death . The dramatic action depends on the ensuing conflict between Kelly and the gamblers . The action also involves several subplots. including Hop 's love for a gambler 's daughter . ) At various intervals the characters pause , in the tradition of Berthold Brecht , to sing songs intended as commentaries to the audience . These dealt with such themes as social injustice and the falsity of romantic love . Both Lawrence and Charlap thought of the play as an artistic statement about modern life , not as a Broadway entertainment . They were thankful that in Susskind and Melnick they at last had found producers with the courage to present such a play . " Those other guys , " Lawrence said , referring to other producers , " wanted lo change the kid into some kind of knight in shining armor , like a crummy love story . " A man in his early 40 's , nearly always dressed in a well-fitting tweed jacket and a soft hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and self-contained manner , as if he never quite heard what anybody said to him . Although known principally as a nightclub comic and as an author of comedy sketches for television , Lawrence had also studied painting for four years after the war with Fernand Leger in Paris , and he believed that an artist 's work was inviolable . Kelly was his first full-length play . Charlap. more excitable and intense , had composed the music for three Broadway shows , among them Peter Pan . A small man , almost bald , he walked with a bouncing gait and spoke in a quick and husky voice , generally accompanied by violent chopping motions in both hands . " The play is something I believe in , " he said . " It thumbs its nose at cliche . I 'm not attempting to appeal to the 12-year-old mind . . . . This is 19154 ; so it 's against sentimental . . . , Give it the bitter chop ; no perfect fifths or octaves . , . . At least let me be wrong on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in it when it gets to Broadway . " 0 n the afternoon of the third day , Daniel Melnick came confidently forward out of the gloom of the darkened theater , his overcoat draped across his shoulders . On his way across the stage he paused to kiss two chorus girls lightly on their foreheads . Under the overcoat. the collar of which was trimmed in fur , he wore a double-breasted cashmere sweater with suede buttons . " Ask any question you can think of . " he said , introducing himself . " With any luck you will be able to write a textbook on how to produce a play in the American musical theater . " Although Levine had contributed the major amount of money . he had entrusted the production to Susskind and Melnick . At the age of 32 , Melnick had been Susskind 's partner for the past year in Talent Associates-Paramount Ltd. , a company that packages and sells television shows and which , as he explained , concerned itself with " all media on both coasts . " Of Lawrence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , are insane . " Ile intended the remark as a high compliment , meaning to suggest that the richness of their talent surpassed I he understanding of ordinary people . Susskind appeared later that evening , I le wore an old raincoat and walked with the rolling gait of a sailor or a prizefighter . " We 're not remote , entrepreneurial figures , " he said , " we 're gutty , rich , virile , accessible . " Laughingly he remembered the numerous auditions for prospective investors , many of whom had been confused by the unconventional aspects of the play . " Overtired society people , " he said , " , . the critics had not yet told them what to think . " THE CORT THEATRE . A WEEK LATER On Monday , December 14 , the company moved to West 48th Street because Ross wanted to try the dance numbers on a larger stage . The scene was nearly identical to the one on the Amsterdam Roof : steam pipes against a brick wall behind the stage , the same harsh light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of rehearsals , had become bored . When not called upon to perform , the dancers and actors sat list ? lessly on folding chairs , reading newspapers , working crossword puzzles , talking about clothes and love affairs . " What do you mean , does she know him ? " said a blond girl waiting to sing , " of course she knows him , she 's been living with him for a week . " The stage had been marked out with strips of tape to indicate the eventual placing of the props and scenery . Randy Brooks . the stage manager , was beginning to note the necessary timings ; how long for platforms to rise into place ; how long for each scene , each crossover , each song . Susskind and Melnick now came to every rehearsal . Often Susskind sat by himself in the back of the theater , staring at the stage with fierce concentration . Late one afternoon he confessed to a suppresqed ambition to become a choreographer . He spoke also of his fondness for the timelessness of the theater. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . " The musical comedy is the only generic American art form . " he said . " I would like to have one continually in rehearsal . It 's great therapy to come and watch the singing and dancing , away from Madison Avenue and the t Melnick had taken to sitting directly behind Ross . whispering in his ear . giv-ing advice about the movements of the dancers , or the placing of the sets , o the rehearsals continued . Ross some-times spoke to the company with a harsh edge in his voice . " Listen , people , " he would say . " this is not very important dialogue , so please just do n't let it lie there . " The actor with whom Ross was most concerned was Don Franc ks , a Canadian nightclub and television entertainer playing the role of Hop Kelly . Although not much past the age of 30. his gaunt face was marked with deep shadows . He had quit school at a young age and wandered around the world . shipping out as a seaman on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in British Columbia , traveling to Mexico on a motorcycle . Melnick had promised him that with Kelly he would be dis-covered as a sensational star in the KELLY Usually he came to rehearsal dressed in soft leather boots and tight-lifting suits of his own design . He seldom spoke to his colleagues . preferring to inscribe his passing thoughts and fancies in the large , black notebook that he carried with him everywhere . Waiting his turn to perform , he would decorate the pages of the notebook with drawings of flowers , like illuminations in a medieval manuscript . At times Francks put his inspirations into prose , and at others into poetry . At the end of the rehearsal on Thursday night . Ross . Melnick , Susskind , Lawrence and Charlap gathered in the 11th row to consider the possible elimination of a song sung by two actors playing the parts of Frank and Jesse James . IOne of Lawrence 's subplots involved the robbery of the Bowery Savings Bank by the James brothers . ) " Let 's be realistic , gentlemen , " Mel-nick said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not hold onto the dream . " As soon as Charlap understood the intent of the conversation , he began to twitch nervously . Susskind put his arm around him , seeking to comfort him . " Moose , Moose , " he said , " stop that nonsense . Nobody 's going to hurt you . " " I wo n't cut it , " Charlap said , " I 'm sorry ; I simply wo n't do it . " So saying , he got up and walked out of the theater . By the following afternoon , Susskind and Charlap had temporarily resolved r differences . But thereafter , if ever kind put his arm around Charlap 's - , , bulder , the color would drain from Charlap 's face , and his eyes would assume a glazed expression . The rehearsals proceeded without incident for the rest of the week , and on Sunday the cast presented a run-through of the entire play for an audience of about 100 friends and relatives . The friends and relatives did not laugh much , nor did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I remember in Paris once , after a performance like this , " Lawrence said without explanation , " the audience yelled ' author , author , ' and the actors brought out a gorilla . " The audience 's lack of enthusiasm had a depressing effect on Ross , who sat slumped in his seat in the last row , his face in his hands . " There is n't a page of dialogue that works , " he said , " not a line . " Melnick , however , managed to interpret any apparent failure as an inconsequential illusion . Of the audience 's response on this occasion , he said : " They 're interested . They 're intrigued , but they 're too respectful , like it was a poetry reading or an evening at the Ninety-Second Street Y.M.H.A. The love scene is too honest . " Much later that night . after long and involuted conversations in the men 's room , everybody agreed that except for a few minor troubles in the lirst act . the play was in remarkably good shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Philadelphia . " For what we ' lave got to say , " he said , " maybe we could cut twenty minutes ; nothing 's so good that it ca n't be cut . " " The wonderful thing about this show , " Melnick said " is that everybody is working together . There is none of that terribleness. that viciousness , those cliques common to most musicals . What we have here is a unity . " EN ROUTE TO PHILADELPHIA . DECEMBER 22. 1964 . LATE MORNING . The talk in the car , a long Cadillac with two telephones , devolved largely on deals : for books , movies , plays . people , television rights and common stocks . Joseph E. Levine , his hat placed hrrnly on his head , his hands spread motionless on his knees , sat on the back seat with Susskind . Melnick sat in front with the driver . They talked with the largesse of Monopoly players exchanging railroads and utilities L evine was in a contented mood .

The Carpetbaggers continued to earn record sums , and in London everybody said that Carroll Baker would attract additional millions in Harlow . For a man who had started out in Boston 59 years ago with no money and no prospects . and who had . among other things , sold plastic statuettes of Daddy Grace on the streets of Harlem , Levine had come a long way . As the car moved slowly through the Lincoln Tunnel , Melnick explained that they might have trouble selling tickets to Kelly because Don Francks , in the lead , was an unknown name . " IIe 's not a star . Joe , ' ' Melnick said . " in Kansas they never heard of him .. . Jesus . what am I talking about , Kan sas . they do n't know him on Forty-Second Street . " " So I 'll give him three pictures . " Levine said .

Joe , " Suss-kind said . " you could talk about Kelly . " " Will Isaac play Hearts and Flowers if I tell him the story of my boyhood ? " Levine asked . During the rest of the trip Susskind seldom spoke . Levine and Melnick. however . continued to talk abou t money . Levine said he had just bought the movie and television rights to Romain Gary 's new novel . The Ski Burn . " Did you read the book , Joe ? " Mel-nick asked . " What do you mean , did I read it ? I did n't have to read it . I bought it . " As the car approached Philadelphia . edging through the suburbs on the north side of town . Levine asked a series of questions about Kelly . Being a novice at producing for the stage . he wanted to know about costs . renting theaters , unions . advertising procedures . At the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " So when do we close ? " Everybody laughed at that , and Levine said that no matter what happened on Broadway . he would make the play into " a helluva movie . " In the lobby of the Barclay Hotel on Rittenhouse Square , waiting for the bellboy to bring his luggage from the car , Susskind looked with mounting doubt and suspicion at the potted palms . " I 110p4. ' we 're going In he 11 ; 11,1 ) ) here , " he said . ACT II PHILADELPHIA , THE SHUBERT THEATER , THE FOLLOWING NIGHT . The marquee outside the theater looked like the marquee on a suburban supermarket . The cold and efficient lettering advertised , as if it were the day 's special grocery offering , a Ssissu NEW NIVSICAL Cosn The phrase was conceived by Nat Dorfman , a New York press agent assigned by Perlis and Susskind to promote Kelly on the road . The show was to play a preview performance on Saturday , December 26 , and on the following Monday , December ' 28. it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-week engagement . At all P.M. Wednesday , as a few people stood in line at the box office , the company began its first run-through with costumes , lights , scenery and orchestra . Ross sat in the 14th row , dictating notes to his assistant . Susskind and Melnick took their accustomed positions , directly behind him . To Ross 's right sat Freddy Wittop , the costume designer , and Oliver Smith , the set designer . To his left . five rows farther back . sat Charlap and Lawrence . The run-through required the better part of two days . Randy Brooks , the stage manager . stopped the performance every few minutes until he had satisfied himself that the sets worked properly and that the actors knew their exits and entrances precisely . The revelation of the sets and costumes inspired Susskind and Melnick to elaborate compliments . " Smashing . Freddy , absolutely gorgeous . " Melnick would say to Wittop , " Ravishing , ( River . perfectly ravishing , " Susskind would say to Smith . The sets had cost almost $100.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lower-class milieu , many of the costumes , which cost another $911,000 , had been made to look poor " They look so good , " Melnick said , " as if they came from an Army-Navy surplus store for S3,98 . " " My rags are silk chiffon , " Wittop said , " otherwise they would n't float that way . The idea is poetic dirt , not just a dirty look . " Charlap and Lawrence , however . disapproved of both sets and costumes . They would have preferred a bleak stage and abstract sets , something more in the tradition of Berthold Brecht . - This is too real . too materialistic . too rich , " Charlap said . " The imagination droops , and suddenly you 're competing with My Fair Lady . In East Germany they would understand how to do this play . " " Well , II it 's a stiff , " Lawrence said , we can always charge admission to let the people see the sets and costumes . " Ross , although pleased with the visual effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sandy Matlovsky , the conductor , and he thought some of , rchestral arrangements lacked styli . itlovsky had been hired at the insistence of Charlap , partly because the two men were friends and partly because Matlovsky had conducted the first New York performance of Brecht 's classic Threepenny Opera . l4 nn Ittsi hpamiig lhrorchest10 play a da ' , iilimhur called Irmigh ad. in an aside 01titisskind and N11-11s , I , , " " that 's the worst Ching 1 ever heard ... wooer saw Ilse past s and I eleplsaus I it in !

Ross and the two producers then summoned their authors to a meeting in the basement of the theater . They had begun to suspect that the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day they had decided to ask Lawrence for three new scenes and Charlap for at least one new song . Although the authors agreed to these requests , they did so with heavy reluctance , doubts obviously beginning to cloud their minds . When they had left , Melnick , who had been a vice president of the ABC television network and there had established Bin Casey , said , " You 've got to he a Jesuit or a rabbi to justify all the changes and satisfy the emotional needs of these people .. . Authors are like children . " Susskind thought Lawrence and Charlap ungrateful for his and Mel-nick 's advice . " They ought to be down on their hands and knees for all the creative collaboration they 're getting , " he said , THE SAME . THREE NIGHTS LATER , Levine , who had gone back to New York after a press conference that first day , returned to Philadelphia for the first preview Before the performance he stood unobtrusively in the lobby , watching the audience come into the theater , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm rain that season . " This week in New York , " he said , " I 've already had a flop and a hit . Marriage Italian Style is big . Everywhere there are lines , long lines at the box office .

" The s I ans. ; are supposed to go I 'm art , are n't they ? f always knew I hat movie critics hated movies , and so from now on I know that drama critics hate plays . " He was especially troubled by the knowledge that the success or failure of a play depended on the opinions of only five or six men in New York " It 's a crap game , " he said " You could take $500,000 to Las Vegas and do as well . " He watched the pertormance from the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last row of seats , together with Susskind . Ross and Mel-nick . They watched the audience with the fascination of children looking at lions and tigers in a zoo . Charlap and Lawrence stood off to one side . Of all the people in the theater they were the ones who most enjoyed the show . Lawrence , who had bought a new tie for the occasion , carried his script under his arm . He laughed at all the jokes and listened complacently to the songs . Charlap , more nervous , paced excitedly back and forth . " They ! the producers ! complained that the book does n't hold , " he said . " Well . it holds , it holds like nothing you ever saw before . " The audience , however , reserved its warmest applause for the sets and costumes . If the customers had arrived discussing Christmas or the weather , they left talking about the same subjects , except for a sympathetic lady in a veil who , expressing the majority opinion , said to a friend on her way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Ross , Susskind and Melnick walked back to the Barclay Hotel in the rain , all of them trying to think of something reassuring to say " I know it 's there somewhere , " Suss-kind said . " I hope we do n't get good notices , " Ross said . " Eddie will be more difficult if we do ... it 's a question of major rewriting . ' ' " At least we now know the things we thought were bad are really just as bad as we thought , " Melnick said An how later , at the Variety Club , a bar frequented by traveling actors , the members of the cast comforted themselves with Scotch and variations of the maxim that Philadelphia audiences are always wrong . They ignored the Christmas tree and the messages of good cheer pasted on the walls . ' In Philly , " somebody said , " they noted West Side Story . " ' If they Aced it , " said somebody else - then we 'd really be in trouble . ' THE BARCLAV HOTEL , THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square , Ross , Melnick and Susskind sat staring gloomily at the Philadelphia newspapers scattered on the floor . Ross sprawled uncomfortably on a couch too small for his angular figure ; Mel-nick and Susskind lounged in armchairs . In a corner of the room , suffused in cold , bright sunlight , a table had been set up with pastry and coffee . The play had opened the night before , and the reviews were mixed . The Philadelphia Daily News , the least important of the local papers , thought Kelly " a thing of quality . . . rowdy in humor and blessed with memorable music and engaging dance . " But the critic for the Philadelphia Bulletin spoke of " a tedious story torpedoed by indecision and the easiness with which it is led up blind alleys . " He described Hop Kelly as " a one-dimensional oaf . " The producers chose to believe the worst of the reviews . " This show is an accumulation of non sequiturs , " Susskind said . " for a hero we have an oaf . a passive iconoclast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is self-pity implicit in his every speech and move . " " We have to get a line to the story , ' ' Ross said , " and then try to fill in the motivations . It happens all the time , just a matter of making the kid heroic , " After an hour of anguished conversation , they decided to cut Frank and Jesse James from the script . to move a successful dance number from the second to the first act and to insist that Lawrence write whatever they told him to write . They also wanted to cut the opening soliloquy , a song for Francks called Ode to the Bridge . Charlap and Lawrence , accompanied by Matiovsky. the conductor , arrived about noon . They took chairs at the opposite end of the room and refused all offers of pastry or coffee . They looked wary . Susskind began by reading aloud the sentence of the review about " a tedious story torpedoed by indecision . " Ile then said , " Eddie , I agree with that review 100 percent . " Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing into a stubborn line . Charlap and Matlovsky looked at the paintings on the walls . To interrupt the awkward silence , Slelnick brought up the subject of the ode to the bridge . " It 's no good , Eddie . " he said , " it 's Gotterdhmmerung . " " Of course , like a bad poem , " Lawrence said . " that 's the whole point of the joke . " " Eddie , " Susskind said . " i t 's a humorless rumination . " " I think it 's funny , " Lawrence said .

The others listened in noncommittal silence . When nobody said anything , Lawrence said . " I do n't know what I 'm writing anymore . " " Eddie , " Susskind said . " do n't talk like that . You 've got a hero . you 've got a mission , you 've got enemy forces . " " Next time , " Lawrence said , " we try out in Hudson 's Bay . They have n't seen an actor there in thirty years .

" " We 've got to have the result . Sandy , " Me/nick said . From Charlap the producers also wanted a second new song , this one a ballad for the newly lovable Hop Kelly . " It should be a song of self-revelation , discovery . recognition . " Susskind said , " the I 've Grown Accustomed to Her Face of our show . " Although Susskind and Melnick wanted to put all these changes into effect as soon as possible , Ross refused to let them give the new material to the actors until later in the week .

" " I hate it , " Lawrence said . THE SHUBERT THEATRE . FIVE DAYS LATER . The first rehearsal with Lawrence 's three new scenes , rewritten since the meeting in the Barclay Hotel , and Cha.rlap 's two new songs . took place on the evening of January 3 .

He still came to the theater every day , not as a matter of interest , but for fear that the producers would change lines without asking him . Watching the new love scene , he said : " Smug , smug . My God , that 's what I ca n't stand , that smugness .... Never again , no more Broadway producers . They want to run the theater like a bargain basement in a department store , trying to sell only what the public will buy .

" She 's a cantankerous lady , " Ross said . " She 's so vulgar I ca n't stand it . She 's hurting us , and she will definitely have to go . " " She 's a cancer , " Melnick said , " a Trotskyite . " Both Charlap and Lawrence , surprised by this suggestion , pointed out that Miss Logan was the nearest person they had to a star , that so far she had received the loudest applause , that many tickets had been sold because of her name , and that , without her , the already small business at the box office might diminish even further . T hat 's a chance we must take , Melnick said . " If she were fabulous , we might not have the guts to get rid of her . but her part is irrelevant . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and we 've got to be ruthless , just as if she were a song or a dance . " " You get a lot of laughs with the mother . " Lawrence said . " Two laughs , Eddie , " Melnick said . " Nobody understands my jokes , " Lawrence said . Without further argument it was agreed to do away with Miss Logan : Melnick said he would tell her on Wednesday night after the performance . Then , taking advantage of this new surge of self-confidence , he telephoned Nat Dorfman , the press agent . " Nat , Nat sweetheart , I 'm very disappointed in you . . . . I 'm unhappy , Nat . The word of mouth is not good enough . Not enough people know that we have a very exciting show . Nat , I 'm not interested in sympathy . Nat , I want II on the radio " THE VARIETY CLUE , WEDNESDAY NIGHT . The miasma of collective depression settled , like a mist in a swamp , along the bar . Th .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screenwriter from Hollywood ( some said it was the man who wrote The Carpel-baggers ) would come east to rewrite the script . Others said that after Boston the show would travel to Toronto in hope of gaining additional time in which to make improvements . Anita Gillette , a small , brown-haired girl with large , soft eyes . sat at a table among several dancers . To Tony di Vecchi , a dancer who kept his money in his shoes , she said . " Tony , am I on the way up or the way down ? " " If it 's a big hit , honey , " he said , " you 're on the way up . " At around midnight Don Francks passed silently and wonderingly through the room , a riding crop under his arm and his familiar black notebook clutched in his left hand . As the character of Hop Kelly gradually became sentimental . Francks 's performance became less convincing . This confused and alarmed him , and so , on this particular night . leaving the Variety Club without saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his hotel room and wrote of his disillusion in his usual cryptic style . ( The relevant entry in his notebook later read : " Thank you for your plastic flowers : thank you for your rubber fern ... the bubbles in my pink champagne have burst . " ) On his way out of the bar Francks smiled bleakly at Charlap , who , with his wife , sat drinking in the corner of the room under the Christmas tree . Charlap was brooding about the transformation of the play and the arguments won and lost with producers . " The job of the creative man . " he said , " is not to let the money men vitiate his work . " And then , growing more excited with the liquor and the late hour and the enormity of the injustice he felt inflicted upon him . he quoted at random from the work of Ezra Pound . savagely cutting the air with his hands and mixing up the verses of several poems . " 0 helpless few in my country , " he began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Go my songs . . . . I have weathered out this storm : I have beaten out my existence . " Ella Logan came in at about two A.M. Round-faced and sly , a woman in her early 50 's , she wore a Hawaiian blouse and looked around the room with the exaggerated melodrama of a conspirator in a Shakespearean play . Talking softly among her supporters in the corner of the bar opposite to Charlap , she reported Melnick 's visit to her dressing room . That night , she said . he had conic to her and told her that her part was being reduced to five lines in the first act and six lines in the second . She interpreted this maneuver as an attempt to humiliate her and thus oblige her , for reasons of her own pride , to quit the show . If she quit the producers could say that she had vio-lated the contract and therefore they were under no obligation to pay her . 38 I'Vlelnick said , " we must not lose faith in Herb . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual interests . All of us have to recognize one thing . Eddie may be a son of a hitch , but he 's our son of a bitch . " Ile went on to tell Miss Logan that she was a destructive influence , and he asked her to please cooperate . " If the show 's a flop , " he said , " we 'll all go hack to television . " " You 'll go back , " Miss Logan said . " Some of us belong in the theater . " THE SHUBERT THEATRE , THE NEXT DAY . Lawrence came to the theater shortly before noon . expecting to watch the actors rehearse a scene that he had written the previous night . Despite his objection to the producers ' intentions he had agreed to more revision . Before he arrived , however , Ross , acceding to the actors ' requests and to his own intuition . had discarded the scene . Instead of following the script , he was conducting an experiment in improvisation , asking the actors to invent their own lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise and well-dressed figure , he saw Ross sitting among four or five actors on folding chairs , all of them staring expectantly into the rafters . He sat down in the third row . " I would like you people to say anything that conies into your heads , " Ross was saying . " Do n't worry about what it means ; just respond to whatever is said to you . " Lawrence listened incredulously to the ensuing dialogue . After he had heard a minor actor say . " I do n't know how the kid is going to jump off that monster and live , " he turned and walked silently away . A few minutes later , however , he could be heard shouting at Melnick in the lobby of the theater . " This is a disgrace , " he said . " These lines will never reach the stage , never . This is worse than Young Doctor Malone . This is sentimental stop . This is abominable . " Although his exact words were not distinguishable , Melnick 's voice , much softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his seat in the third row ( Lawrence had again withdrawn to his hotel ) , Melnick was handed a telegram from an associate in his New York office . NOTES Mom THE IVOR1 TowEit WORD IN NEW YORK IS t BID 111 .041 ? 114 UP . LOOK ( MEAT . Ii TEN ADS 1 NDIN In SEN-sATIoN11 . The telegram partially restored Mel-nick 's self-confidence . Never again , he said , would he produce a musical comedy under the conditions now imposed on He particularly resented the con-tract he had signed with Lawrence and Charlap ; under its clear , Dramatists ' Guild terms not a word of the script could be changed without their consent . at the meeting scheduled for that evening in his hotel room . What with all rhe money involved , and the chance for a hit and everybody 's name in lights , he could not imagine that reasonable men would argue about a few lines of dialogue . " For five hours I 'll listen to the charade , " he said . " I 'll let them catharsize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in Boston . " INTERLUDE Laurence and Charlap never went to Boston with the company . On Friday . January N , the same night that Melnick predicted reconcilialitm , he received a second telegram , this one from the authors ' lawyers . threatening " appropriate action " if he and Susskind continued to permit unauthorized changes in the script . Over tin ? weekend and through the following week the dispute became increasingly biller . During this period the producers became furtive and shy . Susskind returned from London on Monday , January 11 , and rescinded the decision to abandon Miss Logan . Lawrence accordingly proceeded to write her part back into the play . Lawrence 's third and last revision went into the play on the evening of Tuesday . January 12. . - 118wzigh satisfactory to the authors , it failed to en . courage the producers . During the intermission that night . in a bar adjacent to the theater , Ross , Susskind and Melnick , their faces strained and tense , avoided looking directly at one another , like suspects waiting to testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their authors in the Barclay Hotel and presented an ultimatum . Melnick reported the substance of the conversation at breakfast the following morning . " We told Eddie he was written out . that he wets dry and had reached a dead end . The hero is still a petulant , mean and whining kid . We told Eddie he needs help , another writer . " Lawrence refused the offer , still maintaining that the character of Hop Kelly should be hostile . an anti-hero that the audience comes to admire despite his unattractive manners . On Friday , Melnick reported that he and Susskind were determined to do whatever they wanted to do with the show . even if it meant getting rid of Lawrence and risking trouble with his lineyers . The play had continued to suffer at the bar office , and they already had been obliged to raise another S100,000 to pay the show 's expenses . first to Boston and thence to New York . " It 's incredible , " Melnick said , " that guys like Levine and Dorid and myself can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r ? maniacs . . . . I mean . it 's unheard . . . The time for pleasantrie : . 1S past . " On January It ; Lawrence and Chink ' ' , left Philadelphia . The next morning Charlap telephoned from Nat . York and said that he and Lawrence were through with " Kelly . " " It 's not our shim. anymore , " he said . " it 's tenth-rate television jazz . " He reported that on Friday his lawyers had tiled a demand for arbitration of the dispute . Levine had come to a meeting that night and there had been on unpleasant scene . The whole thing was like a sordid German moire , " he said . " Levine shouted a lot . He wanted to know who the hell did we think we were , fur Chrissake , Shakespeare and Beethoren ?

These men are not human beings to me anymore , they 're beasts . These are the men who will blow up the world . " On Monday . January 18 , while stagehands were hanging the scenery in the Shubert Theater in Boston . Lawrence and Charlap asked their lawyers to seek a court order that would enjoin the producers from bringing the show to New York . ACT III BOSTON . THE SHUBERT THEATRE . WEDNESDAY , JANUARY 20 The tedious , familiar business of a dress rehearsal with stagehands , lighting crew and orchestra began at one P.M. The stage was smaller than the one in Philadelphia , and Randy Brooks , the stage manager , had some trouble making the necessary adjustments . The play was to open that night for what was scheduled as a three-week engagement . The cast already had learned a new ripening scene written by David Goodman . a comedy writer and a friend of Melnick 's , who had secretly been with the show for almost a week . The new scene introduced Hop Kelly as a 44 frankly sentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tradition of Horatio Alger . Whereas in Lawrence 's play the boy had been booed and jeered at by a crowd of townspeople when he first came onstage . he was now welcomed with friendly cheers . His father proudly announced him to the people milling around on the Bowery as an idealistic young man . The father 's line read : " Clear the road for Hop Kelly , clear the way for the hero of the world . " M elnick , sitting in the middle of the theater with Ross and Suss-kind , explained that the tangled affairs of the production had assumed " nightmare proportions . " In order to forestall the authors ' demand for arbitration he and Susskind had sought and won a temporary stay in Supreme Court in New York . This stay would postpone the court hearing until the following week . Throughout the rehearsal he was called away to the telephone , presumably to talk to lawyers , and he begrudged the lime thus wasted . " The worst of all this , " he said , " is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Both he and Ross thought that the new scene , together with some other dialogue supplied by Goodman elsewhere in the play , immensely improved the character of Kelly . " Until I heard these new lines , " Ross said , " I never realized how dreadful Lawrence 's stuff was . " He half expected Lawrence and Char-lap to appear at the theater that evening and to come running down the aisles , yelling that this was not their play . " I 've been through that kind of scene before , " he said . " and it 's not particularly pretty . " Nat Dorfman arrived about three P.M .. his arms filled with press releases . He squinted in the dim light . looking for Eddie Lawrence . The producers usually informed him of events threeor four days after the fact , perhaps on the theory that if a press agent knows too much he becomes confused and ineffective . At the end of the rehearsal . on the way to his hotel for a vitamin shot , Melnick said that the advance sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from New York that evening to look at the play . We desperately need good reviews . " he said . " if not . . . Acapulco . " THE SHUBERT THEATRE , LATER THE SAME EVENING . Levine arrived only a few minutes before the opening curtain , accompanied by a retinue of his vice presidents carrying dispatch cases . Throughout most of the performance he remained in the lobby , seated heavily in a red-plush chair , receiving bulletins from Susskind and Melnick . He had conic from Hollywood that afternoon , and he looked tired . " This is not a business for sissies. " he said . ' This is much tougher than the movie business , and that ai n't no lead-pipe cinch . " Although he had originally promised the cast a large party in Boston , to celebrate his triumph in his home town , he felt obliged to cancel it for fear that the show might fail . He did not want to stand around among a crowd of old friends , all of them obviously struggling to think of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Everybody knows the movie 's awful but nobody knows what to say . " A look of remembered pain drifted across his face . " Someday I 'd like to try to produce one of these musicals by myself- You know ... without any partners . " Every now and then Susskind or Melnick came out of the theater to inform Levine of the developments within . Toward the middle of the First act . Melnick appeared and said . " They love it . Joe . It 's great . it works . " Two scenes later , Susskind said . " If only we had thrown those nuts out three weeks ago ; now the script illuminates the characters instead of obscuring them . " Levine remained of the opinion . however , that the play should be funnier . " More jokes . " he kept saying-. " there ought to be more jokes . " When it was over . and before they went back to their hotel to talk to the prospective investors . Levine stood in the lobby with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Susskind have done a lot of line work . and they have a lot at stake . " he said . carefully avoiding the word " we . " " and Mister NIelnick , I 'll tell you something . you put this show in shape in three weeks and get sonic laughs , and you 'll be the new boy wonder . " Melnick smiled at that and said that KELLY it the play was the success he thought a was . he would gladly give some 01 the proms to charity . Enchanted one , again by his own euplua la , he lehl t he theater in an elatisl mood . explaining that he had to go back to his hotel 1,1 " juggle the balls in the air " among the investors from New York . The actors and dancers , however , returned to their hotels , feeling depressed . To them the applause had sounded thin and perfunctory . Only a tew of them bothered to stay up for the reviews . To her agent in New York , Eileen Rodgers sent a postcard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP ! " BOSTON . THE RITZ HOTEL , THE AFTERNOON OF JANUARY 21 The reviews were as bad or worse than those in Philadelphia . Although three of the critics faintly praised the show , calling it " colorful " and " appealing . " the most influential critics in Boston . Elliot Norton on the Record .4merkan and Kevin Kelly on the Globe , damned it unequivocally . Norton described it as " the noisiest musical of the season , a rattling cover for emptiness . " Kelly spoke of " a conventional piece of razzmatazz . " Again , as in Philadelphia , the producers had chosen to believe the worst . In the room overlooking the Boston Public Gardens , the trees already blurred in the gathering dusk , they sat around in the familiar attitudes of defeat and disillusion , Ross on the sofa . Melnick and Susskind in armchairs . On a tray against the wall were the glasses and the liquor bottles left over from the preceding night . " I 'll give you the bottom line first , " Melnick said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week from tomorrow night . " He explained that the reviews in the Record American and the Globe foretold financial disaster in Boston . The investors from New York . after staying up to read the papers , and having learned of the impending lawsuit , had refused all offers of a deal . Levine also declined to advance additional money , and at 10 o'clock that morning he had departed for a week 's vacation in Jamaica . To Susskind lie had said . " David , this is Chicago , and I get off at Chicago . " Levine 's defection left Susskind and Melnick in an embarrassing situation . Lacking sufficient money to support the play for its three-week run , they first decided to fold the show and accept their loss . But then , after long and complicated discussion . they reversed this decision on the ground that if they failed in Boston the gossips back in New York would say that Kelly had been the worst disaster since the Chicago Fire . Whereas if they could at least survive for a few weeks in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Susskind 's phrase , as " just another rotten show . " Having reached this conclusion , Susskind had been on the telephone all afternoon in search of $50,000. enough 10 pay their costs for another seek . To raise this money . Susskind had determined upon a plan to prom-:se , for the same investment , equal shares in several of his other productions . " These money worries sap the creative juices , " Susskind said . " I mean , you 're always asking yourself if you can get out of town alive . What kind of life is that ? " " If we believed in God , " Melnick said . " we 'd pray a lot . " The telephone continued to ring throughout the rest of the evening . First it was Don Francks . Melnick spoke to him in his most ingratiating voice . " You were beautiful , sweetheart , " he said . " touching , great , terrific . very moving .. . , Goddard Lieberson the president of Columbia Records ) saw the show last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the last ten years . " After he hung up , Melnick said , " I thought I 'd better come on strong before he had chance to complain about anything . If he leaves , we 're dead . " B alanced on a desk was a design for the cover of the record album that would be issued if the show was to have even a modest success in New York . Susskind looked at it accusingly . " Someday that could be a collector 's item , " he said . " the only one of its kind in the world . " The longer he considered this possibility the more depressed he became . " We have n't got a Chinaman 's chance , " he said . " I do n't believe in miracles or fantasy or magic . There is only truth , and the truth is that this is a bad show . If I thought I could fool Kerr and Taubman and the other critics so easily . I would lose all respect for the American theater . " Melnick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to rewrite the entire show in a week . Two television comedy writers were on their way from California , and he thought the miracle might yet occur . Lying on the floor , his hands behind his head , staring up at the ceiling , lie said , " This is wild , this is radical , but what about a new number for the opening of Act Two ? Let 's fantasize for a second . " Ross . looking at his shoes , said . " There 's no content , Danny , nothing , Just a lot of sweat and movement to conceal a lack of content . " " I keep asking myself , " Melnick said , " how could those two schlemiels con ( pier us ? it must have been colossal ego on our part , : to think that we could work with ? people . " At this I , the telephone rang again , and o was Charlap . He and Lawrence had come to Boston that afternoon . and they wanted to see the performance that night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must not speak to anybody in the company , and he could not speak to Suss-kind or Melnick . " All communications must be in writing . Moose , " Susskind said on the phone " I do n't want to talk to you ... nothing verbal . Moose . " Hanging up , he said . " The profundity of this experience , this trauma , this holocaust . the reason that the world will go up in a puff of smoke is because people do n't love each other , they enjoy each other 's misery . Moose and Eddie no doubt have their arrogance intact . All that stuff about Brecht , for God 's sake . If they wrote My Fair Lady , Eliza Doolittle would have a cleft palate and a limp . " A few minutes later his daughter called from the University of Wisconsin . Susskind told her that the reviews in Boston had been mixed . that the schedule had been slightly changed . and that the play would now open in New York two weeks sooner . When he put . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she told me ? She told me , ' Do n't worry . Daddy , you can always come here and teach English ! ' " SHUBERT THEATRE , 20 MINUTES LATER Half an hour before the opening curtain the cast assembled backstage to hear their fate . Their faces already made up for the performance . the girls wearing partial costumes or old dressing gowns , they gathered in a circle around Susskind , Ross and Melnick . The bored stagehands listened from a distance . ' ' Well , I guess I 'm elected because I 'm on a panel show and should be used to this kind of thing . " Susskind said . " . . . you all open in New York next Friday . We believe there are enough individual excellencies to warrant opening where it counts . " Susskind then nodded at Ross . " I think the producers have made an extraordinary decision , " Ross said . " They are . . . we are , out of money . It will cost another $50.000 to open in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which really means . " said Eileen Rodgers , " that we do n't have a lighting chance . " At that several people began to talk at once , arguing with one another , their voices beginning to get loud and edgy . Almost everybody , impressed by Suss-kind 's courage and generosity . thought Miss Rodgers unappreciative . " Please , " Susskind said , holding up his hand for silence . " I would hope this is what you want , if not . . . " He was interrupted before he could finish , everybody pressing forward to congratulate him and shake his hand . " Elliot Norton hated Oklahoma ! ** somebody said . " Who cares what they think in Boston ? " THE RITZ HOTEL . THE NEXT NIGHT .

Brooks . a small , energetic man with limning hair , sat in a chair in front of the fireplace . Stern leaned against the mantelpiec'e . Taller and heavier than Brooks , wearing a goatee and elaborate gold cull links in his silk shirt , he chewed gum and spoke with slow solemnity . Both men enjoyed reputations as writers for such comedians as Jackie Gleason and Steve Allen . Ross , Susskind and Melnick sat at the other end of the room , like schoolboys waiting for the headmaster to decide their punishment . " OK. you want it straight . " Brooks said , " you 've got a Chink 's chance . As cloying , as horrible , and as saccharin as some of the scenes are , the audience seems to forgive . " He recommended getting rid of Ella Logan . " I did n't believe a mother 's tears would n't work , " he said , " but it does n't . She softens the show . She 's out there selling torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at Susskind with expressions of triumph , reminding him of their opinion in Philadelphia . " She 's just dreadful , " Ross said . " Everybody who has come from New York says she 's killing the show . " " It 'll be a pleasure to fire her , " Melnick said . " OK , " Susskind said , " so Ella 's out of the show . " Brooks and Stern then proceeded to the principal weaknesses of the play . " What we are up against . fel I as , " Brooks said . " is grievous errors in the structure of the book ; too many extraneous characters sing extraneous songs . Moose and Eddie wrote some marvelous stuff , but they only brought you to the five-yard line . No touchdown . " " The end of Act One , " Stern said , " I do n't know where is the commitment . " " The first three numbers in Act Two , " Brooks said , " are the worst , seventy-five miles an hour into a stone wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That song , " Stern said , " that awful song .. . what 's the name of it ? " " Home Again , " Ross said . " Yeah , right , Home Again , " Stern said . " Well , it 's terrible . What should be an enchanting lyrical moment is a pedantic horror . " With these observations everybody expressed wholehearted agreement . Ross slouched deeper into his chair , peering out at Brooks through his fingers . " You have a very incisive mind . Mel , " Melnick said . " It 's fabulous , Mel , fabulous . " Susskind asked if there was anything good about the play . and , if so , what to do about it . " The best thing in the show is Don Francks , " Brooks said . " What you 're bringing to Broadway is a new boy , a new face .... Go all the way with the kid . The love for the kid is the tickets . More love , more tickets . " " The boy delivers such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to cut three or four A , III t MI A.M. , after 11 pots of coffee and much more conversation . the producers had agreed to cut Ella Logan and to engage a songwriter to write a song replacing Home Again . This , with Miss Logan 's other song , was the ninth of Charlap 's 17 songs to he cut . The producers also wondered if Kelly 's leap from the Brooklyn Bridge at the climax of the second act was properly staged . He accomplished the jump by means of wires , and Susskind had doubts as to the theatrical effectiveness of the stunt . " Sure , leave it in , " Brooks said , " the hippies know he 's on wires , but the Hadassah do n't know .

" ACT IV NEW YORK , A DANCE STUDIO ON SIXTH AVENUE , MONDAY , JANUARY 25 ; NOON . The squares of sunlight on the polished floor gave the room a cheerfulness inappropriate to the mood of the people present . Dispirited and resigned , they had returned from Boston in a snowstorm the day before . Nobody expected a long run in New York . Mickey Shaughnessy had engaged a hotel room through Saturday morning . Ross arrived at 12:30 , his face announcing him as the bringer of dismal news . He addressed the company from a folding chair placed in the center of a narrow semicircle . " OK , " he said . " Almost a total rewrite of the play will be available at four P , M. According to my latest infor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday . Maybe Danny and David can raise an extra MAO . If so , we can pay for another week of rehear4al , and we will open on Saturday , February sixth , but we 've got to figure for the twenty-ninth . " He announced the elimination of Ella Logan , and then outlined the new play as written by Brooks and Stern . They had begun writing it that Saturday morning in Boston , and had finished late Sunday night in New York . In it Hop Kelly had become the boy next door : tearful , sweet and shy . a kid trying to do something for his sweetheart and his dad . The new comedy routines scattered through the play depended on exchanges such as the following , between two gamblers : First gambler : " You ca n't welsh on an Englishman . " Second gambler : " Why do n't you English on a Welshman ? " The cast received Ross 's information with skepticism , knowing that if there was too much new material . they would not have time to learn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . A few of the actors also complained about the quality of the new lines , " It 's Jewish nightclub humor , " somebody said , " Catskill stuff . " Before any of these objections could develop into extended arguments , however . Susskind and Melnick arrived with more words of hope and assurance . They took chairs on either side of Ross . " I hope this is our last chat . " Suss-kind said , " but I want to tell you the facts of life . At the end of our run in Philadelphia we had used up all our money . We have had , as you know , quite a number of troubles , particularly with Moose and Eddie . who thought they had written the Holy Scripture . But I want you to know that I believe in miracles , and that I am working around the clock to raise another $50,000 so that you people can have an extra week of rehearsal . I believe that with the new script we now have a strong show . " When the producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scripts. everybody talked about the departure of Ella Logan . Mickey Shaughnessy. who had become extremely fond of her , had already talked to her that morning on the telephone . He had learned that instead of telling her themselves . the producers had instructed the stage manager to telephone her and tell her not to come to rehearsal . He thought this an abrupt way of tiring a person . lacking in courage or courtesy . " I 'm a very torn-up guy , " he said . " I liked that woman very much , and I wanted to do something to show how I felt about it . But she told me to forget it . that 's the way it is on Broadway . " THE SAME . TWO NIGHTS LATER . The afternoon rehearsals took place in an atmosphere of profound discouragement . At about three P.NI .

" Justice Samuel Gold elected to hear " the matter of Susskind " as the last case of the morning , when only Miss Logan and a few men in shabby over- Ow play . This was his sli How 's ! argiiMra . II , reminded She judge 1h:it it was customary for authors . to accept help if their plays received mixed reviews out of town . " Even a genius must be practical , your honor , " he said ; " if Shakespeare were alive and behaved like Eddie Lawrence . then Richard Burton 's Humid , one of the greatest productions of all time , but one that modified the script , could never have reached the stage . " The judge asked Edward Schlesinger , the attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved in a peaceful manner , perhaps at a meeting in his chambers . Schlesinger shook his head . " Opposing counsel would have us weep for the producers ' plight . " he said , " but it was they who created this situation , willfully , deliberately and vil-lainously . They want to take the play and do whatever they want with it , and we think the play will be a disaster . They are interlopers and vandals . " For several minutes Justice Gold examined the briefs presented by both attorneys , and then , addressing himself to Halperin , he said : " These people are vain about their work . They feel you 'll mess it up in such a way as to make it commercially successful , but not something they wish to lend their names to . Being normal men . I 'm sure they 're acting according to the noblest motives their minds can conceive . " " But $500,000 , if your honor please , " Halperin said , gesturing desperately with his hands , " $500,000 and they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would consider the matter and would hand down his decision in a few days . On her way out of the courthouse , Ella Logan , who was smiling , remarked on the unusually fine weather . " Almost like spring , " she said . " I think I can hear birds singing . " THE BROADHURST THEATRE , MONDAY , FEBRUARY 1 The despair of the previous week had given way to a new hopefulness . Suss-kind had borrowed another $50,000 , thus delaying the opening until Saturday , February 6 . Justice Gold , although he had ordered the dispute to arbitration , had not specified an exact date , and he had denied the authors ' cross-motion to enjoin the opening . Even Melnick 's wife , who had never liked the play and who had come to the dress rehearsal with serious doubts , expected a limited success . As the younger daughter of Richard Rodgers , the composer of Oklahoma ! and South Pacific , her opinion was considered valuable . " The jokes do n't seem like insults anymore , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think it 's on the way to something terrific . " He thought the smallness of the Broadhurst Theatre would contribute to the sympathetic effect . " It 's an intimate house , " he said , " not much bigger than our living room . " " We should have done the play in our livilu ! mum , " his wife " It would have limn cheaper . " Although hopeful of success , Suss-kind still was troubled by the threat of an eventual lawsuit.t to the telephone Charlap had referred to Melnick and himself as " money men , " an epithet That he considered the unkindest of all possible insults . " I low can he say that ? " Susskind asked . " We contribute to this thing on all levels . Those slobs , " he said again , " ought to he clown on their hands and knees to all the people working to save this show . They ca n't be right if it means eighty people out of work and $500,000 lost . " 0 I all the people associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nat Dorfman . For several days the newspapers had been printing stories about Ella Logan 's dismissal . about the lawsuit . about opening two weeks before the date originally announced . Dorfman had been fending off reporters with assurances that these apparent troubles merely foretold a more dramatic success . " I have never told so many lies in my life , " he said . But he reasoned that even the disparaging publicity must do the play some good . " The people will he surprised , " he said . " They 'll like it because they 'll come expecting so Mlle. " THE SAME . FIVE DA YS LATER . The bulletin board backstage was decorated with the usual opening-night telegrams , among them one from Leonard Stern , who , since rewriting the show in Boston and New York . had returned safely to California . The telegram read : MAY THIS BE THE FIRST OP I , rUF1 CFI:Won : - AN CF.S Wandering across the stage , en route to their various dressing rooms , the members of the cast stopped to embrace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain Ross and Melnick. both in evening clothes , came around to thank everybody for their time and trouble . On behalf of the company the dancers presented Ross with the gift of a Japanese tree in a pot . Susskind , who had suddenly become superstitious , stayed away from the theater . On his television program that week he had entertained a group of soothsayers , among them a palmist , an astrologer , a lady with tea leaves , a man with playing cards and a handwriting analyst . In response to his question " Will Kelly be a big . fat hit ? " each of the five had consulted his respective sources and returned with the unanimous answer , " a smash . " The night before . at the last of the five days ' paid previews , Susskind had been absent , eating dinner with friends at " 21 . " Ross and Melnick believed that the show had gone especially well that night and so , for good luck , Susskind had returned to " 21 , " where , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same table with the same friends , ordering the same meal . In the crowd outside the theater , jostled by arriving celebrities , Levine , tanned and healthy after his week in Jamaica , overheard a conversation between the box-office r nager and 12 people who had tickets to the show that had closed the preceding week at die Broadhurst . They wanted their money hack " So do f , ' ' said Levine. ' f'ogether with ROSH , Melnick 's wife and a few of his vice presidents . Levine sat out the performance at Sardi 's , I lie theatrical restaurant directly across die street from the theater . Melnick watched most of the play . standing up behind the last row of seats , and loudly appla . ding at all appropriate moments Whenever the strain became too severe he walked across 44th Street to Sardn and ordered another drink . At the intermission he told Ross he had heard a conversation between a blond girl and Jean Kerr . the playwright and wife of Walter Kerr , drama critic for the New York Herald Tribune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He considered this a good omen , because he once heard a rumor that Jean Kerr exerted an influence on her husband 's opinion . Charlap and Lawrence saw the play from the balcony . Charlap holding a tape recorder and accompanied by his lawyer . Lawrence making notes on sheets of yellow paper . Ella Logan sat with friends in the orchestra . The play went as well as it ever did . The actors and dancers gave their performances all the verve and energy at their command . Nobody dropped a line . But , although the applause sounded loud and hearty in the orchestra , where most of the people had free seats . toe balcony remained ominously quiet . While the audience drifted out of the theater at the end of the performance , Charlap . Lawrence and Ella Logan stood on the sidewalk among friends sympathetic to their respective causes . " I could write better than this when I was eleven years old . " Lawrence sat " The most shocking dialogue I 've heard in the theater in twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " " Cornball , " Charlap said , " one of the ugliest things I ever saw , like a horse with three legs . The work of hucksters . " Miss Logan smiled peaceably . " A lovely night , " she said , " just the kind of night to go for a ride in the park . " SARDIS , A FEW MINUTES LATER . Because it was Saturday . the newspaper reviews would not come out before Monday , but everybody went to Sardi 's anyway , partly because it was the customary thing to do . and partly because at least they could wait for the television reviews . The tables downstairs had been reserved for members of the company and their friends . and when each of the principal actors arrived . there were gusts of applause . At a large table near the center of the room Levine sat with his back against a pillar . surrounded by his family . his friends and his vice presidents . He entertained them with magic tricks , balancing forks and spoons on his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbids outcasts at such celebrations , he stopped at Levine 's table and offered to shake hands .

' ' Lacking even one moderately kind adjective , which they could perhaps take out of context and use in advertisements . the producers decided that morning to close the show . They had no money to pay for another week . During the afternoon Susskind 's office telephoned or sent telegrams to the cast , informing them that there would be no second performance . At eight P.M. Susskind came to the theater to say good-bye to the actors and dancers . Melnick did not appear . The company gathered in the first five rows of the orchestra , all of them stunned , some of them crying . " I had to see you again , " Susskind said . " You 're marvelous people .

The road , paved with the tar-paper shingles of ruined houses , ran in a wide semicircular curve , along the crest of a mound of debris . In the hollow of the curve , rising out of the rank and fetid mud fiats , marsh grass swayed in the wind . Every few hundred yards along the edge of the temporary road , the old men living in makeshift shacks were lighting their morning fires . In answer to questions they , too , pointed vaguely down the road .
