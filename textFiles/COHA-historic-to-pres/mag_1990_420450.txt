Section : Science &; society Cornell 's Frank Rhodes knows the perils of big-time fund-raising <p> With his impeccable British manners , Frank H.T. Rhodes would never think to ask for money before breakfast . But as the president of Cornell University , which last week launched a $1.25 billion fund-raising campaign , Rhodes can not afford to let opportunity go knocking . And so , 40 minutes into an early-morning meeting with investment banker Steve Fillo at the Cornell Club in midtown Manhattan , Rhodes deftly gets down to business . " We 'd like to take a few moments to discuss your own gift , Steve , and anything we can do to help your thinking . ' <p> Fillo , a 1959 graduate , speaks with great pride of how he and his wife Liz met while at Cornell , how both were children of working-class families who needed financial aid in order to attend the Ivy League school in Upstate New York . He speaks passionately of his gratitude for the start that Cornell gave them . And then Fillo pledges $1 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endow financial aid . As a member of Cornell 's board of trustees , Fillo admits " I just ca n't say I gave at the office . ' <p> Frank Rhodes has had many million-dollar meals during the past two years as he has crisscrossed the country meeting with Cornellians and raising nearly $400 million for the " nucleus fund " of the five-year campaign . His university has plenty of company in its search for a billion-plus dollars . Last month , Columbia launched a $1.15 billion campaign and last year the University of Pennsylvania opened a $1 billion campaign . Stanford has already raised $987 million toward its $1.1 billion campaign scheduled to close in 1992 . Harvard is likely to announce a $2 billion campaign next year and Yale is also planning a $1.5 billion effort . <p> The competition does n't stop there . Major public universities , hit hard by state budget cuts , are also into big-time fund-raising . The University of California at Berkeley and Ohio State University both recently completed campaigns that raised more than $450 million . <p> For Cornell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intended to increase endowment , the pool of funds that represent an institution 's long-term security since by law only the interest on such money can be spent . In justifying such huge sums in an era of tight budgets and uncertain enrollments , Cornell and other leading American schools must persuade their alumni and outside donors to pay now so that future generations will be served . In so doing , these schools must address a host of controversial , often painful , issues that confront American higher education as a new century approaches . <p> Should Cornell , for example , spend tens of millions of dollars to underwrite education for minority and international students , especially if it means less space for sons and daughters of Cornellians ? At a time of heightened criticism of the light teaching load of tenured faculty , should Cornell be asking for more than $400 million to endow professorships , at a cost of $2.5 million each ? With the growing crisis in elementary and secondary education , what role should Cornell play in reaching beyond its campus to better prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger question : In its drive to be an elite research university , can and should the 125-year-old Cornell remain committed to the democratic vision of its founder , Ezra Cornell , " that I would found an institution where any person could find instruction in any subject ' ' ? <p> In the venerable Ivy League , Cornell is the young kid on the block with one of the smallest trust funds . Its $823 million endowment , which includes funds for its medical college , ranks fifth among those of the eight Ivy League schools . Cornell 's $44,000 per student endowment is one sixth of that at Princeton , founded in 1746 , and a fifth of that at Harvard , now in its 354th year . One effect is that Cornell has less to spend in the high-stakes competition for top students , especially at the graduate level . <p> With more than 18,000 students scattered in seven undergraduate colleges and four professional schools , Cornell is the largest of the Ivies . But the dramatic demographic changes reshaping the U.S. presage a vastly different student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's freshman class are minorities , including 14 percent Asian Americans . In the Johnson Graduate School of Management , a fifth of the 492 students are from overseas , half of them from Japan . In fact , the school had more applications last year from Tokyo than it did from New York City . Last year , Cornell received 2,000 applications from the People 's Republic of China and Taiwan . By 2000 , Cornell expects a minority enrollment of between 40 and 45 percent . <p> Looking for trouble . Prior to undertaking the campaign , Cornell conducted extensive feasibility studies , including a survey of 5,000 alumni with the potential to donate $25,000 or more . The responses provided a clear mandate for an ambitious campaign but also served notice of potential trouble spots . <p> Perhaps most surprising and most worrisome were the mixed feelings about endowing financial aid . Since 1976 , Cornell has operated a " needs blind " admissions policy in which students are accepted regardless of their ability to pay . It 's an enormously expensive policy , but it helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell 's students receive financial aid from Cornell , at a cost of $21 million last year - up from $5 million in 1979 . The campaign is targeting $250 million for undergraduate and graduate-student financial assistance , partly to take pressure off spiraling tuition costs . <p> The financial-aid issue is especially controversial among older alumni , some of whom wonder why more of today 's students ca n't " work their way through college " as they did . In some cases , the resentment is already building despite Cornell 's efforts to " educate " its alumni on the issue of diversity . " You can easily get into a defensive posture , ' says Susan Murphy , Cornell 's dean of admissions . Earlier this year , Murphy received a bitter letter from the mother of an unsuccessful applicant who claimed that Cornell had violated her daughter 's " constitutional right " by rejecting her application . <p> But Rhodes refuses to apologize for Cornell 's diversity push . Indeed , last spring , addressing the major-gifts committee of the campaign in a plush boardroom overlooking Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we are to survive as a nation , we have to do this , ' he said . " And if we are to remain true to Cornell 's tradition , we must do this . ' The next day , Rhodes went to Hunter College , a division of the City University of New York , to recruit minority students for a pilot program aimed at increasing the number of blacks and Hispanics in graduate studies in the sciences . <p> Rhodes takes a similar position on the explosive issue of research vs. teaching . He proudly points to top professors , like Nobel Prize winner Roald Hoffmann , who teach undergraduates . And Rhodes rejects the notion that research is not an integral part of teaching . But with a powerful 1,600-member faculty , most of whom teach only two courses per semester , and with some graduate teaching assistants leading classes in barely understandable English , Rhodes concedes the criticism is sometimes justified . " We should be upfront in responding to these charges , ' Rhodes tells alumni fund-raisers . " Our record is better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have people who are trying to avoid the classroom in favor of research . ' <p> The biggest new challenge for Rhodes and Cornell is to find money to fund outreach programs to better educate and train elementary and secondary-school students and their teachers . Although 82 percent of Cornell 's undergraduates ranked in the top 10 percent of their high-school class , Rhodes admits , " Even the best students are not as well prepared to go to college today as we thought they were . ' <p> Reaching out . Geneticist Peter Bruns 's summer institute for high-school biology teachers is one of many Cornell outreach programs . But scarce funding limits their reach and can force individual faculty members into perpetual fund-raising . " I want to spend time with teachers , but I do n't want to spend so much time every year looking for money to do it , ' says math Professor David Henderson . <p> Henderson 's understandable distaste aside , when it comes to academic fund-raising , Cornell has become the big red machine . In 1975 , Cornell attracted only $26.1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , which puts it behind only Harvard and Stanford . ( Cornell raises money much more efficiently than most schools . It spends about six cents for every dollar it raises , compared with an average of 12 to 20 cents . ) In addition , since 1985 , Cornell has raised nearly $130 million in four " minicampaigns " for the business , law and hotel schools and for athletics . <p> Cornell , like other colleges and universities , has been forced to raise so much more money on its own in large part because the two other traditional sources of money - federal grants and corporate contributions - have either been greatly reduced or come with restrictions that leave large expenses uncovered . For example , federal funding for campus research facilities in the U.S. has declined from $2.1 billion in 1978 to $200 million this year . At Cornell , the federal government 's contribution to student aid has increased only 9 percent from 1980 to 1990 , while the university 's contribution has risen 372 percent . <p> Like many of its peers , Cornell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the professional and personal interests of its alumni . Cocktail parties and black-tie dinners are still part of the fund-raising arsenal . But Cornell has learned that weekend seminars on real estate , labor relations and supercomputers are much more likely to get alumni juices flowing and lead to larger donations . The 440 prominent alumni who have been " elected " to the Cornell Council to " assist " the school are also prime targets of the fund-raising efforts . " The idea is to get people thinking of Cornell first thing in the morning , ' says Carol O'Brien , Cornell 's former director of development who is a consultant to the new campaign . " Then when you ask them for money , they 're already there . ' <p> The key player in this massive effort is the lanky , 63-year-old Rhodes , a British-educated geologist . The grueling campaign is the swan song of his tenure at Cornell , which began in 1977 . Even Rhodes 's toughest critics admire his self-effacing sincerity and his mastery in building personal relationships . " Frank is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Cornell alumnus who has pledged $2.5 million for a new scholarship program . The wooing of Carl Kroch is a good example of the Rhodes approach - and of how delicate and time-consuming the process can be . Kroch , a 1935 graduate who has made a fortune with the bookstore chain , Kroch 's &; Brentano 's , was not involved in alumni affairs for many years . Rhodes was instrumental in changing that ; in 1981 , Kroch donated $1 million to endow the university librarian 's position . During the past two years , Rhodes has made seven or eight visits to Kroch in Chicago , hoping to secure a large gift toward the $75 million library campaign . A few weeks ago , Kroch pledged several million dollars for the library . <p> Cornell 's successful fund-raising has brought inevitable problems back on campus . Rhodes turned over his day-to-day duties to two senior aides and despite his efforts to retain a strong campus presence , his frequent absences have prompted criticism . Some wonder if his courtship of donors has made him reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also busy trying to manage rising expectations that the big-bucks campaign will solve the school 's immediate and longer-term problems and eliminate the need to make difficult choices . Even while the big checks pour in , Rhodes is cutting the budget - by at least $10 million during the next 20 months . Consolidations in academic areas such as economics and design are being contemplated , and Rhodes suggests that such activities as health services and career counseling will eventually be sharply reduced . <p> Cornell officials admit to concern about launching the campaign just as the U.S. economy teeters on recession . They admit that in some cases , potential donors have delayed gifts , especially those tied to real estate . " The enemy of a campaign is time , ' says O'Brien . " If there is a sense of stagnation , it 's tough to get people feeling positive again . ' <p> Rhodes 's greatest fear about the campaign is that too many people at Cornell will see it as an end in itself , that somehow the theme of the campaign , " Better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his commencement address last May , Rhodes warned the graduates not to fall victim to " Percy 's Paradox , " the pitfall described by author Walker Percy in which people attain straight A 's in school but fail life 's larger tests . If that should happen to Cornell , for Frank Rhodes , all the miles logged in search of a billion dollars will have been in vain . <p> Picture : A president 's reward .
