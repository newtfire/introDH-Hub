Calves ' Brains Scrambled Sirs : <P> <P> Although I am a native of the district Senator Willis used to represent in Congress , I had never heard him speak until last fall when I was taken along-for-the-ride to a rally of Republican women at Columbus ; and since that time I 've felt like starting out on a crusade-a futile one , probably , for I must admit that the girls seemed to relish such examples of bawling calf oratory as ( I quote impressionistically ) : " that lovable , that noble , that fooo-oully maligned man , Warren G. Harding " ; " the gloooorious wooomanhood of the State of Ahia " ; etc. , much , too much , etc . If , as Pastor Rudy praises , the Senator showed " unusual intellectual capacity as a mere boy , " may I timidly wonder what unfortunate accident transmuted those " remarkable " brains into a mess of something that ( if it were lady-like to call names ) I should follow the menu cards to describe as Calves Brains , Scrambled ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife 's Cousin 's Brother-in-law <P> Sirs : <P> Please let Heflin alone for a while . Next thing you know he will discover and announce that TIME 'S editor 's wife 's cousin 's brother-in-law had a Catholic grandmother . Or is it possible that you get your popishness less indirectly ? <P> Rosco BRONG West Liberty , Ky . <P> Fact Sirs : <P> Page 9-ist col. of your issue of Mar. 12-you speak of Ex-Senator Oscar W. Underwood as being a " lame duck . " <P> Fact is that Senator Underwood voluntarily retired from politics after twenty years of wonderful service to his country and honor to his party , and never offered for re-election or desired same ! <P> <P> R. C. GORDON <P> Savannah , Ga . <P> <P> To able Oscar W. Underwood , apologies for an unjust appellation. - ED . <P> Fear <P> Sirs : TIME 'S scintillating , crisp , news style is hav ing a widespread effect on advertising copy , and magazine writing . Here lately I detect it in almost every magazine I pick up . Perhaps buried deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless there , with its char acteristic sparkle . . . . <P> I suppose my extensive reading as House Or gan Editor and advertising man accounts for noticing the influence that TIME 'S copy style is beginning to have in magazinedom . <P> I fear for " TIME 'S Typical Style , " because it is being copied so much that soon it will be no longer original . There is no way to copy-write it . TIME may be forced to adopt a new style when its present " Typically TIME " style becomes too common practice . <P> <P> G. BERNARD RIDDLE <P> Editor Oil-O-Matic News Williams O.I-O-Matic Heating Corp. , Bloomington , III . <P> <P> Let not Subscriber Riddle , acute , observant , fear for " TIME 'S Typical Style " because he scents plagiarists , pirates , copycats . TIME has created no set , wooden " style , " which could be aped , but instead strives toward that future medium of expression in which words shall be best fitted to deeds . TIME welcomes progress-by whomever made-toward this goal. - ED . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
