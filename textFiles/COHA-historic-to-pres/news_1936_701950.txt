Former President Hoover arrived here today to become the center of a series of rousing demonstrations leading up to his speech tonight before the Republican convention . As a result his political stock again was put on a rising market . Following his attack on the New Deal and , , for him , the virtually unprecedented . demonstration which came after he called his party members to a " Holy crusade for freedom , " the California delegation went into session to discuss , among other Lhings , the possibility of placing Mr. Hoover 's name before the convention for the Presidential nomination . Whether his home-State representatives or any other delegation nominate him or not , the opinion here was that his speech tonight , and the day of aaulation preceding it , had put the former President in the position of an elder statesman whose advice and assistance will be sought and used during the coming campaign . From the time he arrived here this morning from Chicago until he departed tonight for New York , Mr. Hoover was the center of at , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched closely by those interested in the candidacy of Governor Landon of Kansas to see whether Mr. Hoover would give any encouragement to the groups which previously had been unable to get together to prevent the Kansan 's nomination . Mr. Hoover avoided private conversations during the day with any of the leading candidates . He and his spokesmen sought in every way to dispel the idea that he had come to Cleveland to rally the anti-Landon forces , as many had thought he would . He insisted on confining to his speech what he had to say , leaving interpretations to the delegates . Tonight , after the speech and the tumultuous reception given him , many party leaders closely watched for the results of the session of the California delegates . The delegation adjourned late tonight , however , without taking any action relative to Mr. Hoover , but planned to meet again tomorrow . An ovation that continued for fif- teen minutes and was stopped only upon a personal appeal from Mr. Hoover himself , greeted him upon his arrival at the convention hall tonight . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to be conducted to the platform , the crowd of 15,000 persons literally jumped to its feet with a burst of cheering . The band in the rear of the hall took up the familiar Hoover campaign song : " California , Here I Come . " Chairman Snell tried to quiet the crowd but could not be heard . The former President stood out on the platform , making no attempt for the moment to stop a demonstration far greater than that accorded him in the same hall when he appeared here in October , 1932 , as a candidate for re-election . Texas Delegates Ring Cowbells As Mr. Snell waved and pounded for silence , the Texas delegation began ringing its cowbells . The Virginia and Tennessee contingents started a parade . Other State standards were raised high in the air . Delegates all over the great hall tore up programs or other paper matter in their hands and threw it into the air . Mr. Snell finally appealed to Mr. Hoover . The former President walked to the lectern and held up his hand for silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several minutes . It did not understand that radio time was flying fast . A crowd estimated at 8,000 greeted him when he arrived in the city on a morning train from Chicago . From that moment until he ' left his hotel this evening for the convention hall he was besieged by hundreds of delegates and spectators , most seeking to learn , hours in advance of his address , what stand he proposed to take . Despite his own protestations that he was not a candidate for the nomination , the ex-President 's wellwishers hoped during the day for a drive that would stampede the convention into naming him as its choice . Soon after he arrived supporters in his own delegation from California raised the new slogan : " Hoover or his choice , " but Mr. Hoover himself gave no sanction to the plan to put the nomination at his disposal . The former President was evidently suprised by the reception he got when he arrived . His train stopped on the level beneath the main floor of the station , where he received the official welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted by Chairman Fletcher of the Republican National Committee , who pinned a gold convention admission badge on Mr. Hoover 's lapel . Among the welcomers were former Secretary Hurley , former Postmaster General Brown and others of Mr. Hoover 's former political and governmental associates . Mr. Hoover evidently thought this was all there was to the greeting . But when he reached the upper concourse he found thousands of people jammed there to see him . Persons on every side grabbed for his hand , necessitating a quick call for a police escort to see him through the lobby of the station : In front of the station , Mr. Hoover found other thousands to greet him . On his way through the building some one yelled " Hooray for Hoover , " and several hundred joined in a demonstration , waving their hats , whistling and shouting . The former President smiled broadly . In front of the station he obliged photographers by posing for his picture , and went through a few handshakes for the benefit of the newsreels . Then he was escorted by police through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the lobby he received another demonstration . He was taken to his rooms on a rear elevator . Mr. Hoover did not remain in his room long . His spokesmen stated early that he would hold open door all day , except during the time he worked on his speech . It was not long before Mr. Hoover had taken up a stand in a convention ' room on the parlor floor , and within a few minutes persons were flocking through the corridors to see him . Brief Meeting With Vandenberg Among Mr. Hoover 's first callers was Senator Vandenberg . Their meeting was short , and took place in the presence of fully 200 persons . " Chief , how are you ? " said Senator Vandenberg as he shook his former leader 's hand . " I am glad to see you . You 're looking fine . " Mr. Hoover responded with only a few words , which , according to Mr. Hoover 's spokesmen , comprised the only conversation between him and Mr. Vandenberg . The talk with former Senator Moses , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , Mr. Moses simply joined the line of people who were pushing forward to shake the former President 's hand . The anti-Landonites among the regular delegates and spectators , hopeful that Mr. Hoover might say something to aid their fight , gravitated toward his room when he was not in the public parlor . Private conversations could be heard among these groups concerning developments and combinations which they believed Mr. Hoover could effect against the Kansas Governor if he would do so . Several persons tried to talk with Mr. Hoover about the party outlook , particularly about his own chances to stampede the convention , but he would not listen . He would merely smile and turn to the next person in line , seeming to enjoy being the " mystery man " of the convention far the time being until he dispelled the suspense with his own words at the meeting tonight . Mr. Hoover did not give out advance copies of his speech , partly , it was understood , because he wanted to work on the text still further but also partly because he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appears a Different Hoover Delegates and observers commented that it was a. different Hoover who arrived in Cleveland today  --  different from the man who came here in 1932 to speak in the same hall in defense of his record in the White House . He was a tired man then , worn by the manifold problems created by the depression . His welcomers , too , were different in attitude on that former occasion . Many thousands greeted him at the station and at the hall then , just as they did today , but they were grim and solemn , unnatural under the stress of the economic conditions then obtaining . In those days one could count a half dozen breadlines near the station and convention hall . The Hoover who appeared here today had the attitude of a buoyant leader , taking this opportunity to re-enter the national arena . He was more of the warrior on the attack and he seemed to enjoy it . Mr. Hoover left for New Yorlc late tonight . He will hold business conferences there .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
