The long-simmering pot of Polish-Russian relations this week finally boiled over and spilled its lava-hot contents into the laps of Britain and the U.S. In Mos cow , Soviet Foreign Commissar Viacheslav M. Molotov handed Polish Ambassador Tadeuz Romer a note : " . . . the Soviet Government has decided to sever relations with the Polish Government . " Thus Polish-Russian amity ended with the first break between two members of the United Nations . <P> The break was not astonishing . The Russian note declared that the Polish Government had collaborated in German claims that the Russians had murdered 10,000 Polish officers ( TIME , April 26 ) . Behind this incident lay an accumulation of differences which sooner or later was bound to revive the ancient enmity of Russia and Poland and break their tenuous alliance . Only in the sense that Goebbels ' trumpetings had hastened the inevitable could the rupture be called a victory for Nazi propaganda . <P> The Polish problem was now an immediate problem for the U.S. and Britain . At the crux of the difficulty were territories ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans invaded Poland in 1939 . Great Britain was formally committed , the U.S. was at least morally committed , to see Poland 's prewar territory restored . But Soviet Russia was not prepared to give back the disputed Polish lands . Perhaps the Poles were again to learn an old and wretched lesson : that in the larger interests between great powers , the smaller nations usually have to take the rap .
