Fetching a quick breath , he would shrug , trying to shake it off ; and for a moment , indeed , he would . He sang songs and thought of his college books , and he made of his mind a map of far countries , strange shores : striving to grasp and hold that detachment which alone could be his strength . But this force was like a body of water : he could strike out and so , for an instant , achieve a vision of freedom ; but the water would close in , patient and inescapable . In the mountain southwest of his home lay a wedge-shaped canyon , as if a section had been cut and lifted out ; and on the brink of it he sat for a long while . He looked down into his homeland , staring at each strangely familiar thing . The old house stood deserted now and a new house of lodge poles stood among trees . He saw his mother enter a dugoutcoop and then appear and go to the stable . He saw his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slough . But it was at the river and the Bridwellplace , the islands and the steaming springs and the upper wilderness of aspen and serviceberry , that he gazed most earnestly . It was the old dooryard where , crazed with fear , he had awaited his mother 's return ; and the high bank where Hankie and jewel had played husband and wife ; and the field where Jed had thrown him down and stuffed his throat with earth : at these and a thousand others , each a landmark in his pilgrimage of terror . Whether he loved his home more than he hated , or hated more than he loved , he could not tell . It made him shudder but it also made him weep . It filled him with dread but with poignant yearnings also , because it was so dignified in its loneliness , and inP101its unpitying estrangement so much was lovely and soft . He had suffered here almost beyond endurance , but so many hours had been alive with flower-smell and bird-song , with taste of wild rose petal and chokeberryand gilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these lying in gentle beauty beyond the pain . The earth he loved and the pine trees and the fields of clover and the meadows of strawberry blossomand dandelion ; but superimposed upon all these , like one photographic negative upon another , was the weird pattern of delirium and blood and death . He looked into memory at these and saw flowers beyond . He felt again the terrible silence but within it was the fluting of larks . He touched the yellow insanity of the sun and felt under it the warm deep peace of earth . And so the picture shaped itself and stood in memory , with friendliness in the brooding desolation , with ruthless violence in the loveliness and quiet . He rose and took his bags and started down . And it seemed to him now , as formerly , that his journey fell into prison , down from the hills and the sky . A moment ago , he could look a hundred miles into the west , but now the picture closed like a shutter , until nothing was visible save his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the roof of sky , feeling terrifiedand lost . There was nothing to fear in this canyonbut he went headlong , glancing back , from time to time , to see if anything pursued . And when he reached the house , he was white with exhaustion and drenched with sweat . He saw his brother first . Mertyl during the past year had been a senior in high school . In Mertyl 's letters Vridar had sensed a change . For Mertyl hadp102been president of his class and had assumed a leading role in the school 's drama and had edited the yearbook . No longer a slave , credulous and humble , he now looked at his brother with dubious eyes . " Hello , " Vridar said . " Where 's mater and dad ? " " Outside , I guess . " For a long moment the brothers looked at each other . This young man , Vridar realized , was a stranger to him and had always been so . For seventeenyears they had lived side by side , later sharing the same bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering in school a common derision ; but they were strangers now . Vridar left the house and went to the barn . On the way he met his father and grasped his powerful hand . " Hello , " he said . " Hello , " said his father . " Where 's mater ? " " She was here a minute ago . She 's around some-wheres . " Vridar found her sitting by a bush . She sprang up and came to him and he folded her in his arms . He kissed her hair and her tired face and then held her off to see . " How 's mater ? " he said . " Oh , I 'm all right . How 's my son ? " " All right , I guess . " They went to the house , neither speaking , and Vridar felt ill at ease . His mother , too , was a stranger and had been since his birth . When they entered the house , Diana came fromP103a bedroom . She ran over to Vridar and kissed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked  --  your old sis is all right . " - Vridar sat down and he knew that the whole family was watching him . Mertyl smiled a little , his eyes shrewd and appraising ; and the others , too , searched him for change . He writhed under the scrutiny and turned in his chair . Glad to be home ? " his mother asked . " Yes , I guess so . " " you guess so ! Ai n't you sure ? "  --  Well , sure I am . " " Tow you like college ? " Diana asked . " Oh , it 's all right , I guess . " You do n't sound like you care very much . " He looked at his parents and he saw in their eyes what he had seen there before : pride in education and knowledge , pride in their daughter and sons . He had always returned from school disappointed in what he had found . It had been so in Annis , in Rigby , and it was so now . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send him away , he had never told them the truth and had always pretended that schooling was a glorious thing . Reading their doubts now , he said : " Sure , college is a grand thing . Everyone oughtto go . ' That was better . The doubt left their eyes . " What you learnun about ? " asked his father . " Oh , English and economics and sociology . . Nature study . "  | Joe and Prudence looked at each other . Their glance said , " That is very fine , indeed . " They looked at him . " Mertyl , " Prudence said , " has been a leader this year . " She looked at Mertyl who had always stood in his brother 's shadow . " Yes , he wrote me about it . " There was a long silence . It was the silence of strangers who were growing more strange . For the homecoming of her sons , Vridar saw that his mother had cleaned and repapered the house ; and of a photographof him and Mertyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young men , lean and pale of face , very earnest in their mouth and eyes . They looked as if they had never smiled or had an amusing thought . An awful seriousness filled the picture from top to bottom and from side to side . " You like it ? " Prudence asked . They all looked at the photograph . " I guess it 's all right , " Vridar said . " They look terribly serious . " " They are serious . You'n see they have big serious thoughts . " In his face and in the face of Mertyl , Vridar saw an earnest credulity , a weird zeal , that annoyed him . He was not what he had been a year ago . No , indeed : he was a world-weary skeptic now . He said he guessed he would go out and see how things looked and he left the house . Towser was an old dog now with a lot of gray in his hair . King , secondin favor of all beasts here , was graying also and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever known . Formerly , whenp105at the sawmill , he would escape and come to the river ; but he would not plunge in blindly as other horses did . He would choose his landing and then go up the river , looking across , from time to time , as if to judge the speed of the water , the distance to the far side . Other horses got lodged under a high bank or pitched into whirlpools or bashed against rocks . But King was too foxy for that . Vridar stroked his heavy mane , much too thick and long for so small a horse . He was a grotesque fellow , being very handsome in his head and neck and very ugly elsewhere . And he was cynical , too . While Vridar stroked him , King looked about for a halter , suspicious of such kindness ; and after a moment he walked away and then looked back . While standing here , Vridar saw a coyote in the meadowland . He went to the house and Joe grasped his rifle , and the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe sat where he could overlook a wide clearing and Vridar and Mertyl with the dog entered the jungle . Towser picked up the scent and was off . In a few moments he entered the clearing at full speed , and Joe , who was three hundred yards from him , fired one shot . Vridar and Mertyl came out and found Towser dead , with a bullet almost in the center of his forehead . They stared in consternation at the dog . " My God ! " Vridar cried . Joe came over , thinkinghe had shot the coyote . " Good God ! " he said . They all loved this dog but it was Vridar who loved him most . Years ago , terrified and weeping , he had gone for the cows and it was Towser who had gone with him ; and in many an hour it was Towser , more than anything else , that had kept him from going mad . It was Towser who had been the friendliestthing in his life . And now he was dead . Vridar gathered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prudence reproached Joe but he needed no reproach . His grief , too , was deep . They all looked at the dog and they were all silent . Vridar felt tears on his cheeks and he went away for a little while ; and then he got a spade and dug a grave . He put Towser into a box and lowered him into the grave and he let the sod fall gently ; and he and Mertyl sat by the mound and looked at sunset , burning the sky . " I feel like I 'd lost my best friend , " Vridar said . " Yes , " said Mertyl . For a long while they did not speak again and in silence they went to the house . Supper was eaten and in silence the family went to bed . Vridar could hear the river and a great wind on the trees , the terrible haunting sounds of his childhood ; and he saw in memory one hour and another on the wild desolate hills when he had run , sobbing with terror , and Towserhad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the grave . He remained here all night.  | AS THE days passed , golden and lazy , he tried to lose himself in work . He tried to be cheerful and now and then he jested or attempted to laugh . His mother said to him : " It sounds funny , son , to hear you laugh . Let 's hear you laugh again . " " Why ? Did n't you ever hear me laugh before ? " " Not much . I do n't seem to remember any time . " " I ca n't remember , either . I guess I never did . " And she said , too , that something was preying onhis mind . What it was , she could not tell . He wentaround like one in a trance and she wanted to knowwhat bothered him . " Nonsense ! " he cried . " Nothing bothers me . " " I know , son . You ca n't fool me that way . " He looked at her , wondering how much she knew . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " " I never told you very much . Anyway , I 've got to stand on my own legs . " She said he would always be her baby , her little man , as he used to be . This annoyed him . He frowned at her , remembering his dark years . " Tell mother . I want to know . " She came over and put arms to his neck . She said he was her sweetheartand would always be and this statement filled him with rage . " Do n't ! " he said , and he pushed her away . " I know , " she said . " It 's Neloa . Son , are you really in love with her ? " " I do n't know . " He flushed and went to the door .   " Then you should go and see her . I do n't like to say this but she 's gettun a bit wild . " " That 's all gossip ! Why do you listen to gossip ! " " Well , mebbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's smoke , there 's fire . " " You do n't like her . That 's the trouble with you . " " Why , son ! For shame . I 've always liked her . But she 's very young and I do n't think her father watches her . " He paced the room , wishing he could invoke God 's wrath on gossip . In spite of her curt note , she was still sweet and pure and he would thresh anyone who said she was not . " I been a-thinkun , " his mother went on , " you could have her here . A dance or a party or something . If I ask her I think she 'd come . " " Would you ? Ask her here , I mean ? " " I guess it would be all right . " " When ? " " I could ask some others , too . You could find out then if you loved her . . . . Why son , you 're shakun all over ! " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the stage was set , the plot laid ; and Vridar , unable to eat or sleep , built all his life to the meeting . The party was to be on the Fourth of July . Diana went out to the Antelope Hills , riding a wild mustangcalled Fury ; and she invited a dozen young persons , including Neloa , and rode home . During her absence , Vridar was unable to think at all . He prowled about as if crazed ; he went up the dugroad , hoping to meet his sister ; he lost himself in a leafyp109shelter and sat there for an hour , trying to quiet his heart . He could not believe that Neloa would come . In his life , there could be no such wonder as that . Neloa here , in his home  --  or with him alone in some solitary fragrant place ? Impossible ! She would not come . She would write another impudent note and that would be the end of his dream . " If he wants to see me , tell him where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Diana coming , he leapt from the shelter and ran to meet her . She came up , her horse prancing madly , and Vridar circled round her , his whole being listening for her words . But she only grinned and said nothing at all . " Is she coming ? " he cried . " No , she wo n't come . " He drooped . He felt as if all life had been knocked out of him . His face was so woebegone and his body so limp and ridiculous that Diana laughed . " You lied ! " he shouted , and ran stiff with new hope . " She is coming , is n't she ? " " Mebbe . " " Why mebbe ? " " If she'n get away . " " Di , how did she act ? Tell me ! For God sake ! " " Oh , she just smiled and said she 'd like to come . " " Who  --  who did you say invited her ? " " You . I said you wanted her to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I told you , darn it . She said mebbe . " " Di , what else did she say ? " " Oh , I ca n't remember everything was said . We talked quite a while . " " Did she mention me ? "   " I do n't remember she did . " " What else did you talk about ? Tell me . Di , please ! " " Oh yes , she asked had you got back from college . " " And what did you tell her ? " " I told her you had , of course . " Diana stared at him and then laughed merrily . " What you shakun for ? " " I 'm not ! " He looked down at his pitiable legs . " Di , what did you tell her ? " " Why , I told her you got home when you did and you liked college all right and you was dyun to see her . " " You did ! And what did she say ? " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You liar ! . . . Is that all she asked about me ? " " All I'n remember . " " And is she coming the night before and stay all night ? " " Mebbe . " He approached his sister but the horse veered wildly and stood on its hind legs . " Tell me , " Vridar said , imploring her across the distance , " you think she 'll come ? " " I guess . If she do n't get sick or anything . " Vridar 's sigh was long and full . " Thanks , " he said , and he went off alone with the delirious joy of his heart . Everything around him seemed tender and sweet and good . There was no darkness now , no fear . There was only rapture that wanted to spill out of him and bubble and purl like a brook ; only a flutteringecstasy , full of music and light . It swam in himp111like wine and poured its floods through his thought , heaped its unendurable splendor around his heart . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of this wonder , ravishing this one certainty , breathing it , drinking it , crying its name . He went over the hills , frisking and capering and spending his joy in wild fierce nonsense , and anyone seeing his transports would have thought him mad . He embraced trees or climbed them and tumbled clown . He scaled a ledge of stone and went shouting like a lunatic after a hawk ; leapt over bushes and fell and then gurgled with pure delight . But there was no outlet for the tides that shook him . He was wound up and he struck about him and howled , stood on his head , turned somersaults , or loped on hands and k flees and barked . Gesturing at the sky , he addressed to it a burning rhapsody of love and promise , letting out of him all the bitter loneliness of his years .... After an hour his mood changed suddenly as if a light had been turned off and he walked in darkness like an old man . He was convinced now that she would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sick or someone in the family would die . And he reproached himself now for having been a wild fool . He sat down in horrible disappointment 11 and wondered what he should do . When he came in to supper , he looked so haggard that his mother was alarmed . Mertyl and Diana stared at him . " Son , what 's the matter ? Where you been ? " " Oh , out and around . " " What has upset you ? "   " I 'm not upset ! " he shouted . " What 's the matter you people , anyway ? " " Son ! " " Do n't son me ! Let me alone , will you ! " " He 's just in love , " Diana said . Vridar did not eat . He entered a tiny bedroom and crawled into bed . He could hear the family in the kitchen , talking of him ; and a little later his mother entered and sat on the bed . She took one of his hands and stroked his hair back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted so queer ever since you come home . . . . Tell mother . " " There is n't anything to tell ! Why do you keep saying there is ? " " Because I know . Son , do you really love Neloa ? " " Oh , I do n't know ! Do n't ask such silly questions ! " " You love her a lot , do n't you ? " " I hope not . " " She 'll be here soon . So what is troublun you ? " " She wo n't come ! " Vridar cried , and choked with self-pity . " Of course she 'll come . Diana said she seemed very glad . " " She has no way to come . " Prudence studied his face . Again she stroked his hair . " Well , Diana can go and fetch her . Does that make you feel better ? " " Nothing can make me feel better , " he said , speaking as if he had lived a thousand years . " But I 'm all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't like to see you this way . It makes me unhappy to see you unhappy . " He looked up at her tired patient face . He sat up and kissed her cheek . " I 'm all right . The ranch just makes me blue , that 's all . " " I know , son . Well , you wo n't come here many more times . " Her eyes filled with tears . " Now , " he said , " who 's worrying ? " " No , I 'm all right . I just think of this place without you children . I 'll never be able to stand it ... . Well , have a good sleep now . I know she 'll come . " She kissed him and patted his hands and left the room . He thought of her for a long while : her devotionand slavery and her dreams . " I 'm a hell of a son ! " he thought . " I 'm too selfish to live . I ought to be dead .... He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept little and ate little and he felt very silly and futile . Diana was amused , Mertyl was amused and scornful , and his parents were full of doubt . Though common peasants of earth , they were very proud and they had hoped he would marry a college girl . They liked Neloa and her family , but the Doole clan was a thriftless and nomadic lot , indeliblymarked with Sioux Indian and with no more interest in education than they had in the Baffin Islands . Neloa was all right , his mother said . She was a sweet and lovely girl . But would he be happy in marriage with a girl who had been only through the eighth grade ?   " You must think about such things . " " If she 's my wife , " said Vridar , " she 'll go to school . " " Well , that would be all right . I 've heard she likes school . " And Prudence told Joe that Neloa would go to school and Joe 's stare became less dubious . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter-inlaw ; but he did n't want his sons to marry ignorant nobodies . This talk of marriage bewildered Vridar . He was interested in love , and marriage , for the present at least , had nothing to do with it . " I 'm not planning to marry , " he said , scowling at his mother . " I 'm only a kid yet . " And he glanced at Mertyl , in whose eyes of late he had seen only cool derision . He saw only derision now . " Love and marriage , " he said , " are only fiddlesticks . Bosh on them . " And he shrugged and looked at Mertyl again . Mertyl'sderision had spread into a thin smile . Diana saddled two horses and said she was going to get her woman . " I 'll fetch her , " she said , " if I have to rope her . " Vridar began to tremble and he found a chair and sat down . It was very absurd , as even he could see , for his family to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . For three days now , Diana had been jesting of what she would do . " If she says she wo n't come , I 'll hog-tie her and drag her here . " And again : " Vreed , cheer up . I 'll herd her over here just like she was a wild cow . I 'll fetch her , do n't you fret . " And here Vridar sat on his heels  --  preposterousp115Romeo , shivering clown !  --  watching his sister prepare to fetch the bride . He was the one to go . It was very silly to send Diana , as if he were afraid , or as if he were an Asiatic lord , recruiting for his harem . And he rose and left the house , detesting himself . Diana mounted Fury and grasped the lead-rope of another beast . She smiled and waved goodbye . " Cheer up , brother . In three hours she 'll be here , lookun at you . " He watched her go up the dugway and over the mountain and into the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hid . While in hiding , he dramatized his meeting with Neloa , giving to her a blushing coyness and to himself a princely air . He would be superbly cool and dignified . When he spoke to her , his voice would be firm and quiet , his English perfect ; and she would be a little appalled by his magnificence . But he knew he would be nothing of the sort and he came out of hiding like a scared thing and began to walk . He climbed the mountain , reproaching himself as he went : thinking with scorn of his limp and irresolute manhood , of the birdlike fluttering within . He was a great fellow , indeed ! " I 'm all right , " he said . " What do I care ? If she does n't like me , what the hell do I care ! . . . Will , when looking well wo n't move her , looking ill prevail ? . . . I 'm all right . " But he was not all right . The more he reasoned with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gurgled , as if full of deadly ills . Talking to himself was of no use and walking did no good . And excitement gave to his voice an adolescent squeak that was too silly to think of . He stood at the top of the dugway and looked west . As punishment for his want of strong manhood , he hoped she would not come , that he would never see her again . That would serve him right . No woman should ever look at him , save to laugh , or ever speak to him , save to ask why he shook . They should say , " You must have a fever . Look , will you ? how he shakes around . Is n't he silly ! " They should say , " Here , boy . You 'd better take a physic . You 'll fall to pieces in a minute . . . . " Yes , that was all he deserved . And while he stood in the road , torturing himself with ridicule , his heart leapt to his throat and caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Diana and Neloa , and with a gasp he fled . He went down the road like a hare and then left the road and went pellmell , jumping over bushes and trying to get lost . Under a bank he came to a stop , wheezing like a foundered nag ; he mopped his brow and fanned himself . She was coming ! . . . Her glance would say , " Well , you invited me . Why do you sit there and shake all over ? " Ah , Lord ! And what would he do ? He would writhe in his chair and hesitate . Going quietly down through trees , he came to the grove east of the house . He stopped again , wondering what he should do . It would be best , it seemed to him , to pretend that he had work : to get a spade and set posts , as if he had forgotten Neloa was coming , or did not care . And he went to the house and got a shovel and came out to a fence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a post . He spaded at another hole but he could wait no longer ; and he knew that he would sneak up guiltily like a spy to see what Neloa was like.  |p117Round  the trees he went , quietly as a fox , and came to the woodpile and hid in a bush . In a few moments the girls came to a halt within forty feet of him . Diana was talking but Vridar had no ears for what she said . His eyes , his whole being , was fixed on this tall lovely girl , with hair falling to her waist in dark splendor , with the light of a thousand morningsin her eyes . She was such a vision that he held his breath and this moment was one of the supreme and wordless moments of his life . With all his senses he devoured her . He saw her dark voluptuous beauty , heard her rich throaty laugh ; felt her warm deepbosomedwomanhood ; and in fancy touched her and trembled at the touch . Then the girls went to the house and Vridar stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug furiously , as if he had acres of labor to do ; and his body was drunk and his senses swam in memory . He saw her again on the day when she first entered his life ; and on the evening when she stood at his side in the school 's contest , with her hair spilling round her ; and on that winter night in Rigby when , after the show , she stood by the gate and looked at him . His whole life , it seemed , had been full of her , as , indeed , it had ... . " Vreed ! " For ten years he had loved her . He had loved others , too , but not with such earnest passion , not clear to the bottom of his soul . Helen he had loved , Norma he had loved . But Neloa he had worshiped ... . " Vreed ! Hey , where are you ? " He turned and listened . For several minutes , he realized now , someone had been calling his name.  | " What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . " What you up to ? Why do n't you come in ? " " Come in ! Hell , I 'm working , ca n't you see ? " " I got a surprise for you . " " Never mind . I 'm busy . " He pretended that she spoke in riddles . He scowled at her and shrugged and the shrug ran through him like a shiver . " Ca n't you see I 'm busy ! " " Listen , you big egg ! Neloa is here . " " Oh , is she ? " he said . " Why do n't you come in ? " " So she came after all , did she ? " " I made her come . She howled all the way up here . " He went over to his sister and looked at her . He could pretend no longer . " Di , did she want to come or not ? " " Sure . She was crazy to come . " " Do n't be smart ! " he howled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . But she 'll go back if you don'tshow up . " She grasped his arm . " Come on . " He shook her hand off and retreated . " Go on in . I 'll come soon . Say I got to finish some work . " " Oh , your work can wait ! " " Di , do n't be a fool . Please . I 'll come in a minute . " Diana left him and went to the house . Vridar resolved to stay here until at ease , but the more he fought for control , the more he shook . In despair with himself , he grasped a barbed wire and jerked it and the barbs cut a furrow down one palm . HeP119looked at the blood and he felt quieter now . Now he would have an excuse . He would enter the house , seeking iodine , and if he saw Neloa , he would affect surprise . He went to the house and lingered at the door . He looked round him for a place to hide if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , he pushed the door open and stepped inside . His mother came to the door and saw his bleeding hand . " What you done ? " she asked . " Oh , cut myself a little . ' Where 's the iodine ? " She searched for iodine and he searched , too , and from the living-room door , Diana rebuked him with a scowl . Prudence found iodine and poured it into the wound and while Vridar distorted his face with agony she bandaged his hand . He liked the pain : it was a small punishment for his cowardice . He wished he had cut his hand off . To postpone his entrance into the living-room , he found fault with the bandage , asked his mother to use stouter cord , and in one way and another delayed the meeting . But at last , with his mother impatient and with Diana mocking from the doorway , he could pretend no longer . He had to enter now . But first he got a drink and brushed his hair a little . Crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung it on a spike and then stepped outside to brush dust from his shoes . He came in , with his mother and sister watching him , and drank again , feeling more and more absurd , and suddenly , desperate and goaded , he swung and faced them and stalked in . P120WITHOUT looking at Neloa he crossed the room to the north wall and sat close to a chiffonier , hidden from Neloa 's sight . His mother and the girls talked . He stared at the floor and answered questions in a word or a phrase . The sound of Neloa 's voice , bringing to him , as it did , memories of other times and of a few priceless hours with her , made him shake , and to hide his emotion he moved back and forth or from side to side in his chair . His mother 's eyes watched him closely : eyes full of compassionate amusement ; and Diana mocked him outright . She wanted to know if the cat had his tongue . She wanted to know if he was scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's talked about you for weeks , " she said , with that awful want of tact common to sisters . " Now he 's dumb as a egg . Lordy , he has n't slept a wink for four nights ! " " Yeah ? " said Vridar , glaring at her . And very suddenly he started and almost left his seat . Across the room from him was a large wallmirrorand when he glanced at it , for the first time since coming here , he saw Neloa watching him . " My God ! " he thought , and was horrified . He had thought himself securely hidden and she had been watching him all the while ! What had he done ? What queer distortions of face , what agonized postures of body , had she seen ? He felt a terrible rage . It had been mean and silly of her to spy on him . P121But when he glanced again at the mirrored face , all the rage left him . She was smiling at him and her smile was friendly and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was all right . . . . He looked again and their eyes met and he blushed and turned away . Thereafter , from time to time , he glanced at her , and her gaze was always fixed on him . It was searching but not critical . " Move out here , " Prudence said . " Mebbe Neloa would like to see what you look like . " He scowled at his mother and then remembered that Neloa could see his scowl ; whereupon , seizing his chair and wrenching it , he moved out into full view , feeling horribly exposed . Anyway , she could not see him in the mirror now . While affecting to examine his chair , he glanced at her , and he saw that she was still smiling , that her gaze was still very intent . He sat in utter wretchedness for a few minutes and then excused himself and bolted outside . He did chores until after dark and when he came in he was thankful for pale lamplight . Sitting back to the wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time , giving her swift guilty appraisals ; or he stared boldly when she turned her back . She was taller than he had thought she would be . She was more than five feet and a half but very graceful and queenly . Her body , his mother had said , was perfect ; and he fed on her loveliness , wondering if this was so . Her bare arms seemed perfect , and her hands , too . Once when she sat , her skirt was drawn above her knees ; and Vridar glanced at her legs , not as an amorous lover but as a pious guardian who disapproved . He would teach her to keep her dress down . And once when she stooped , he saw the womanly fullness of her breasts ; and this carelessness , too , he severely condemned . His own sister had been taught to stand with her heels together and not to sit with her legs crossed ; to wear her clothes firmly , so they would reveal nothing ; and not to bend over like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Neloa 's teaching , he reflected , had not been of much account ; but he would take care of that . She was still young  --  only sixteen  --  and he could instruct her in the manners of a lady . He went with Mertyl to bed and the girls slept in the living-room . While they undressed , he could hear them gurgle with nonsense , and once he heard Diana shriek , her voice running high and wild . At all this he scowled , wishing both would show more dignity and sense . He felt vaguely , but not as a clear admission , that shrieking girls were amorous girls , and the thought displeased him . He refused to think of any girl as amorous , preferring to believe that her mind dwelt above sex , aloof if not unaware . Nor was his own response in any way amorous . His love was so pure as to be almost impotent ; and when at last he fell asleep , the most that his dreams dared , and all that they wished , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning he heard Neloa talking , and there came to him again the incredible wonder of her being here . He dressed and crawled through his window and went to chores . He cameP123:awkwardly to breakfast , content to be silent , to be speechless in his happiness . During the forenoon the family sat and talked , waiting for other guests , but none came . Then Prudence took Vridar aside . Did he want to take a walk with Neloa , to be alone with her for a little while ? Did he ! Ah , Lord ! " I been thinkun , " she said . " It would be nice to go across the river . You could walk up to the old millsite . " He left the house , his heart pounding like mad . What a golden mother she was ! What a miracle it would be to walk with Neloa up the canyon , through huckleberry gardens and under the pines ! Not far up was an old millwheel and a millstream : as in that song which spoke of these and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone , with so much loveliness around , would be heartbreaking . But first , of course , he would have to ask her to go . He could not ask her with the family present : there would be Diana 's giggle and Mertyl 's scorn . He would have to be a clever rascal , plotting the matter to suit himself . He went outside and prowled about , now looking up the road , as if he saw amazing things there ; or now inspecting one thing and another , as if they needed mending ; or now moving off swiftly , as if bent on an important errand . Then Neloa and Diana came out and went to the barn , lingered there a moment , and came back ; and Vridar knew they were out here for him to speak . Prudence had spoken to Diana and Diana had entered the plot . But Vridar would rather have died . His heart was half out of him and his thoughts were like leaves in a wind . But he approached them , nevertheless , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could never remember what . He maneuvered until he stood by Diana and then jabbed her ribs with an elbow . She cried and looked amazed . " What 's the idea ? " she said . Well , that sort of thing would never do . Diana knew all about horses but she did n't know much about love . . . . He strove to speak . He glanced at Neloa again and again and made an attempt ; and then choked and burned and looked away . She was smiling at him . Her eyes were bright and mischievous , as if she found him a most engaging riddle . He tried again . " I  --  I been wondering if you 'd  --  would you like to take a walk ? " " I guess so , " she said . " Where ? " " Oh , " he said , looking desperately round him at all the canyons and peaks . " Anywhere . . . . We  --  I guess we could take a boatride . " " All right , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's all take a boatride . " Vridar glared at her . A worse idiot , it seemed to him , he had never seen . . . . But the matter was settled : Diana said they would all take a boatride , and she ran off to find Mertyl , leaving Vridar and Neloa alone . Red with confusion now , and unable to speak , he stared earnestly at far mountains and heard the ridiculous pounding of his heart . Neloa 's gaze was steady . " You like college ? " she asked  | " Oh , I guess it was all right . " He knew that she was still smiling and that her eyes were amused . Great God , he wished Diana would come ! " When does college start this fall ? " " September , I guess . I  --  I do n't know exactly . " " Will you go this year ? " " Yes , sure . I guess so . " Then they were silent and Neloa still watched him and Vridar saw nothing at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his swinging on it . He could hear his heavy breathing and was annoyed . But remembering the note gave to him , though he could never have told why , a little ease , a little boldness and a little scorn . He swung and stared at her , and his gaze , for a moment , was so hard and searching that she looked surprised . Diana now came , fetching Mertyl , who looked sardonic and bored . They all turned up the lane . At first Neloa walked with Diana , but Diana in her blunt way took care of that . " Get back there ! " she said , and pushed Neloa toward Vridar . " Mert , come up here . You 're my feller today . " Mertyl walked ahead with his sister and Vridar and Neloa walked behind . Diana overflowed with say nonsense and tactless quips but the others seldom spoke . Vridar kicked at the dust , feeling more and more ridiculous ; or he glanced up at the sky , wondering if it might rain ; or he stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of them . If a bird hopped out , he would turn to look at it , as though he had never seen it before : but in every instance it was only a robin or a chickadee . And all the while he was trying to seem at ease and casual , as if walking with a girl bored him a little . They came to the boat and stopped . He bailed water out , glad for this brief refuge . It was Diana 's notion , clearly enough , that they were all going across and have a look at the old millstream . Vridar watched her and when she looked at him he winked mysteriously . " What you winkun at me for ? " she asked . When the boat was ready , Vridar set the oars and leapt out . Neloa stepped from the bank to the boat and her skirt was drawn up , showing part of one thigh . It was a lovely thigh but a most indecent exposureand Vridar was ashamed of her . Beyond any question , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana moved to enter but Mertyl grasped her arm . " You 're staying here , " he said . " Like heck , " said Diana , looking at him . " What you mean ? " " Beat it , " Mertyl said to Vridar , and he held Diana 's arm . Vridar grasped the oars and shot the boat into deep water . Neloa sat facing him now . Her smile was inscrutable , a dimpling warmth on the surface of her thoughts ; and her eyes were inscrutable , too . Vridar glanced at her and bent to the oars . A skillful hand with a boat , he was determined to amaze her with his deftness and strength ; but he realized , after a moment , that she was not interested in his rowing . He abandoned his titanic efforts to pull the boat inP127two and luxuriated in a mild rage . There were girls , he reflected , who would have been astounded by his might . When they reached the far bank , he anchored the boat and looked across . Mertyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the boat and he turned with her into a forest and in a few moments they were lost . Of all times in Vridar 's life , none surpassed in pure romantic glamour the two hours that he spent here . They were cloudless and infinite and perfect . He and Neloa walked on an old road and they said little , but no happiness before , none that came after , was deeper than this . It was enough , it was almost too much , to have her so near to him and alone . Now and then , when a branch lay on their path , he lifted it aside ; now and then he glanced at her lovely face ; but in all else he only moved in a dream and marveled at the wonder of this hour . He never took her arm , never touched her , save by chance ; and when her arm did touch him , or when , as once , she slipped and put a hand to his shoulder , the rapture that floodedrut darkened his eyes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surf of glory over his heart . While alone in these hours , he did not kiss her or have conscious wish to do so . Out of the hunger of flesh , he distilled a spiritual ecstasy , and this , for the present at least , was enough . When they came to the old mill , he knelt at the stream and drank and then washed his hands and she drank from his cupped palms . When her lips touched his hands , something went through him that was like flame . They sat on a grassy bank and heard the low murmuring of the stream , and they breathed the fragrance of bearberry and wild currants and fir ; or they gazed up at the dark blankets of evergreen ; or they looked at each other and smiled as children do . Vridar felt more at ease now . His joy , intense and throbbing within , broke on a great sigh and he laughed . Neloa laughed , too , and he glanced at her and laughed again . Their laugh , he recognized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate wooing in Annis , and of a thousand other matters in which he had been too silly for words . He felt as if a darkness had been lifted away . " Wonder if we should go back . " " I guess so , " she said . " I do n't want to , " he said . He faltered and the darkness closed round . He caught himself in retreat and he made himself say what had been on his tongue . " I want to stay here with you  --  just to be with you . " Her only answer was a smile . To such a confession , it seemed to him , a smile was not enough . He had offered his heart and she must have known that . " We'n stay a little longer , " she said . Ah , that was better . She must love him if she wanted to stay . He looked at her and his stare was very devoted and realizing this he blushed . He grasped a stick and whipped at his legs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his laugh was strange . " Why ? " " Oh , I 'm such a queer guy . " He rather liked calling himself a queer guy . He wanted to be in-P129scrutable , too : a riddle that none could read . " I guess you think I 'm funny , do n't you ? " " A little bit , " she said . He stared at a dark mountain flank . He thought of an adventure in the last summer and spoke of it . Last summer , he said , he had killed a bear without hitting it , but he had never understood how . Perhapshe shot over its head and stunned it . Anyway , it rolled off a ledge and broke its neck .... He looked at her and he saw that she was not interested in his tale . " What makes you think I 'm funny ? " he asked . " Oh , I do n't know . You just are . " " I hope you like funny people . " She looked at him and her smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . They turned down the canyon , walking slowly ; and the half-mile to Vridar was only a hundred yards . On their way down , not a word was said . He felt t hat they shared a common mood and that their way lay together through life . She was a little shy , of course ; she was not used to being alone with men ; and he liked her shyness and silence . . . . When they reached the river , Mertyl bawled at them . " Hurry up ! You been gone hours ! " They entered the boat and crossed , and when they came to the far bank , Mertyl rebuked again . Sitting here , he said , had been no fun . And that , Vridar reflected , was a great way for a brother to talk . " I 'm sorry , " he said . On their way down the lane , none of them spoke .   Mertyl scowled ahead of him , and Diana walked very soberly , as if her day had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How , she asked , was Neloa going home ? Did he not want to hike out and borrow his uncle 's buggy and drive her to Antelope ? At such a prospect of heaven , he began to shake . He told his mother to watch Neloa and see to it that Diana did not run off with her . In feverish haste he ran to the barn and harnessed a team and then went up the mountain and over the hills . " For why you want it ? " Dock said . His eyes were large and cunning . " You takun a girl out ? " " Sure . " " Who ? That Doole girl ? " " Maybe . What if I am ? " " All right , " he said . His grin was big and round and lewd . " You'n take it . But none of your monkeyshinesnow . A lot of girls has learned things in them-there buggies . " Vridar dashed home with the ramshackle buggy lurching from side to side . He saw Neloa at the woodpile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels squealinglike a herd of pigs , with the boards of the seat clattering ; and when he swung the team , the buggy spun round on two wheels . He fancied himself a wild and devilish fellow and he liked the consternation on his mother 's face . " Whoa ! " he shouted , and sprang down from his chariot . But now all the boldness left him . He walked round the team , pretending that collars needed adjusting , that the neckyoke was broken , that a bridle was too large . When he could no longer fumblep131here , making a clown of himself , he came in sight and tried to speak . A horse snorted and this gave him anotherexcuse . " Hey you ! " he said , shouting like a schoolboy ; and he was busy again , doing nothing at all . " Son , " his mother said , " Neloa is ready to go home . " " Just a minute ! " he said , annoyed . He yanked at the belly-band and set it up a hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist her but she sprang lightly up without his aid . " You must come and see us again , " Prudence said . " Thanks . You should come and see us . " " We 'll try to . But we 're awful busy these days . " " Better hang on , " Diana said . Neloa laughed . " I will , " she said . These aspersions at the buggy made Vridar furious . He looked darkly at his sister and jerked at the reins . And then they were off . The buggy rattled and shook , and the wheels , turning on axles worn thin , wabbled drunkenly from side to side . He was so shamed by the vulgar squealing and the wired doubletreeand patched tongue , the rickety seat and the lopsideddashboard , that he looked straight ahead of him for a long while and did not speak . They climbed the dug way and came to the benchland ; they went down a dusty gray road , with the horses trotting now ; and he looked to the north or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite dark now and stars were out and the night was fragrant and warm . Once when the wheels on Neloa 's side fell into a deep rut , she threw an arm to his neck , and ecstasy poured through him like wine . An impulse came up from his wild heart and found words , bold incredible words , which he had never dreamed he could utter . " It 's all right to keep your arm there , " he said . Her laugh was low and pleased . All right , " she said ; and she laid her arm across his shoulders , her hand almost to his cheek . Rapture filled him and shook him and mist gathered to his eyes . For a half-mile they journeyed in this way , neither speaking a word . When the buggy lurched , her hand touched his cheek ; and after a while , obeying another impulse , he pressed his cheek to her hand . Then he looked at her and he saw that her eyes were full of bright tenderness . Feeling bolder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished they could ride all night , forever and ever , with her arm against him . This was heaven , deeper and fuller than his dreams of it , and more than he deserved . A sweet vibrant ache lay in his breast and throat and rose in tears to his eyes . He had never been so happy before . He was never to be so utterly happy again . Seeing ahead of him the Doole farm , he was driven to do something in an effort to hold this hour and make it eternal . If he let her go now , perhaps he would never see her again . He could never let her go now . He loved her with all his strength and faith and hope : with her , life was a garden , beautiful and clean ; without her it was desolation and he was lost . No , he must love her and worship her and care for her . And this , he told himself , was no spontaneous love , no passion of the hour : it reached back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown into him , in the way that branches reach to a tree'sp133heart , and it had given to him all the foliage and springtime that he had known . But he doubted that she loved him and pride would not let him confess his own love . Yet he must speak . This blinding intensity , built out of his years , and so awful in its earnestness and power , was surgingthrough him like his own blood . He looked off into darkness and strove to be calm . The whole world around him was a mist of softness , for his eyes were wet . And when at last he spoke , his voice was so strange , so broken , that he did not recognize it as his voice . He said : " Neloa , if you loved a man , would you let him kiss you ? " " Yes , " she said . He gazed ahead of him , blinking his eyes fiercely to shed their tears . He moved as if tortured and spoke again . May I kiss you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant yes . But he did not kiss her at once . He thought of his questions , her answers , doubting that either had been spoken , wondering if he dreamed . Then he stopped the team . He turned to her , trembling in all his body , and drew her to his arms . She came willingly with a little sigh and her hair fell in glory round his face . He kissed her soft mouth and then pressed his cheek to her cheek . After a few moments he released her and spoke to the team . A full moon rose now and everything was very clear and he could see far down the road . He clasped one of her hands and they rode to a corner and made a turn . And he spoke again .   " Neloa , do you love me ? " " Yes . " He could not believe this . Turning to her , he looked at her eyes , trying to read there the falseness or truth . They were dark luminous eyes with something in their depth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in his throat . Will you marry me ? " " ' Yes . " This he doubted also . Surely so much of heaven was not meant for him . He dreamed that she was here with her arm round him : this girl whom he worshiped , for whom he would have died . It was all a trance and he would awaken soon . He would find himself in bed after a night of dreams and life would be what it had always been . He pressed her hand and looked at her , trying to make the hour seem real . " Are you sure ? Neloa , be sure . " " Am I sure of what ? " " That you love me . " " I am sure . " " But it ca n't be ! " he cried . " You 've seen me onlya few times . You 've never thought of me . " " Oh , have n't I ! How do you know that ? " " I know you have n't . . . . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neloa , be serious , please . If you do n't love me , send me away now ! Tell me to go apd I 'll go ! " " I do n't want you to go . " " How much do you love me ? " " Lots . " " As much as I love you ? " " Yes . "  | " You do n't . You never will . You never could . .. Tell me this : how long have you  --  loved me ? " " Oh , a long time . " " In Annis ? " " I guess so . " " When we went to the show in Rigby , did you love me then ? " " Yes . " " When will you marry me ? " he asked , still torturedby doubt . " When do you want me to ? " " Tonight . Will you marry me tonight ? " " Yes . " In a frenzy of joy , he drew her to him and kissed her again . Then they came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He helped her down and then hitched his team to the fence , and they stood here by the gate for a long while . He held her to him , but not firmly , not with her legs touching his ; and he searched her face , still goaded by a fear that he dreamed . " Neloa , if you love me , please say it again . " " I love you , " she said . " But you  --  you 're not impulsive like me . You do n't  --  " He finished with a sigh . For a little while he studied her face . She was a very lovely girl , he thought . Her eyes were like a darkness of luminous velvet . Her hair was a black wonder hanging to her waist . Her teeth were the most perfect he had ever seen . " I wish , " he said , and stopped . He trembled and shrugged . " Neloa , I wish I could tell you how I have loved you for years and years . But you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how much I loveP136you now . You 'll never know . You 'll die without ever knowing . " Tears came to his eyes and he looked at her through tears . " I  --  I worship you , Neloa ! My God ! " He turned away and tried to shake his grief off but it surged up out of his dark years and he was overcome . Going to a post , he sat there and bowed to his knees . In a few moments Neloa came over and sat by him and put an arm round his neck . He kissed her hand . " I 'm silly ! " he cried . " I hate myself ! But you do n't know ! God , you do n't know ! . . . I have loved you so much ! " When his grief was spent , he rose and she came to him and they stood as before . He saw that there had been no tears in her eyes . " We 'll be married , " he said . " We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's more than I 'm worth . " She squeezed his hand . He drew her closer and kissed her lips and her eyes and her hair . The time was past midnight and she said she would have to go now . " Stay a little longer ! " he implored her . And he added . " When 'll I see you again ? " " When you want to . " " No . I want to see you all the time . I 'd rather die than leave you now . " He thought of the work at home . " Next Sunday , " he said . " I do n't want to come to the house . Meet me on the road . " " All right , " she said . " Neloa , at one o'clock . You wo n't be late ? " " No , I wo n't be late . " " Just above the bridge . "   " All right . " She turned away , smiling at him , and went toward the house . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone and he would never see her again . He leapt the fence and ran after her . " Neloa ! " " Yes ? " she said , turning . He came up to her and he was trembling so that he could hardly stand . He looked at her , again searching her face and her eyes . " Oh , Neloa , I hate to let you go ! " But he saw that she wanted to go . Instead of being resentful , as was his proud suspicious way , he thought her quite sensible , himself very silly , and he said goodnight and went back to his team . He watched her and when she came to the house she turned and waved to him . Then she entered and the door was closed and he was alone . He waited for a little while , hoping she would come out ; and if she had returned , eager to see him , he would have been delirious with joy . But she did not come and Vridar sprang to the buggy and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His heart ached so that it choked him and now and again he stood up to get his breath . It felt as if a hand had reached into m and now lay within . And while he rode home , there came to him in a sudden flash , as if lightning had filled his years ahead , premonition that was terrible and dark . It could have been no more sharp and real if someone had spoken . But in an instant it was gone , and nothing remained but the deep fragrant night , full of memory and dream .   FROM this July day until September 6 , Vridar 's life , save for two small incidents , was perfect . It was a cloudless interlude , an idyl of glory , of a kind he had never known and was never to know again . When he looked back upon it , from a later time , he saw it as a handful of golden days . He saw it as a cloud , bright and soft and nebulous , hanging between a darkness out of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After reaching home on this first night , he lay awake until morning , passing in shining review the wonders of the last hours . A little after dawn , he heard Joe speaking to him . Time to get up . Fellers who go to dances have to pay the fiddler . " Mertyl awoke and stared at him . In his father 's words as well as in Mertyl 's dubious stare , Vridar perceived a touch of malice . The one envied him , having left all ecstasy behind ; the other thought him foolish and held women in contempt . His mother , too , after he had dressed and entered the kitchen , regardedhim with eyes that were a little caustic . Why , Vridar wondered , was love a subject , not only here but elsewhere , of ironic jest . They all wanted to know why he had got home so late and what he had done . At the breakfast table they thrust at him , now with a veiled hint ; now with a question ; and he grinned at them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in love , " Diana said . " It did n't take him long . " " In love ! " said Prudence . " He 's been in love a long time . . . . How long you been in love with Ncloa , son ? " Vridar blushed and looked sheepish . " I do n't know , " he said . Joe 's eyes were bright with unspoken banter . Mertyl looked at him with undisguised scorn . And on the next day , when Vridar announced in a voice that betrayed him and ran into a high falsetto , that he was engaged , the family regarded him with amazement . This , said Joe , was faster than young men worked in his day . Ordinarily they went with a girl several times before popping the question ; and he stared hard at Vridar , as if wondering what kind of son he had . " He sure did n't waste no time , " Diana said . The big stiff ! He went round here like he was scared silly and the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sisterly misgivings . " Just as well get it over with , " Vridar said . He ventured a strong manly laugh and failed . He blushed and turned in his chair and then , with sudden interest , was intent on his hands . " Well , " Diana asked , " did she say yes ? " " If she did n't , I would n't be engaged , would I ? " " And you always said you 'd never marry young ! " " Well , I 'm not married ! I wo n't be for a longwhile . " " He 's just trying her out , " Mertyl said ; and this was his only comment .   When alone with Vridar , Prudence drew near and studied his face . " You know , son , mother wants you to be happy . Neloa is a nice girl . I like her . . . . But when you 're married , you 're married a long time . " " I love her , " he said , scowling at the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , mother just wants her son to be happy . She 's a sweet girl but I ai n't sure she 's the wife for you . " " Why not ! " he cried in a voice so loud that it startled him . " Well , I just do n't feel she is . Mebbe I 'm wrong . ... Son , I 'd be awful sure . " While pitching hay he thought of these admonitions . What kind of girl , he asked of the sky , did they want him to marry . And what was it their business , anyhow ! Why were mothers always suspicious of their daughters-in-law , and why did they suppose they knew best what their sons should do ? To hell with mothers and their snooping ! He was a man now and he would choose his own wife and hell and high water could not stop him . And as a gesture of his manhood , he heaved mightily with the pitchfork and snapped its handle in two . But he knew his blustering was very silly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished only to guide him to a happy life . Just the same , their doubting that he loved Neloa : could anything be stupider than that ! Do I love Neloa ? he asked himself ; and all his blood surged upward in a great affirmative . It was the one hot and tremendous certainty of his life . Yes , he loved her , and he never asked himselfp141this question again . Even in a later time , when his world was split open , his heart almost torn out of him , he never asked this question ; because no matter what he did , no matter what he said  --  and he came to say and do most incredible things  --  there always stood within him , from end to end of his being , his love for this girl . And during these days , while waiting for Sunday , he could think only of this proud queenly person who was his . His fixation was so extreme , his absentmindednessoften so ridiculous , that he was laughed at , jibed and made fun of ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion so overwhelming , there was nothing to be said . Neloa was his consciousness and his dream . He dwelt on the touch of her arm and the smell of her hair and the sound of her voice . He relived his hours with her , telling them over and over ; until she was life and the only meaningand everything else was dark . Now and again he doubted that she had been here ; and he decided to fetch some token home , a lock of her hair or a statement of love in her own handwriting , to convince himself that his happiness was real . When Sunday morning came he rose at daybreak . He saddled his pony and was ready to go when he remembered that their meeting was for one o'clock ; Fend he groaned at his stupidity and hated himself for a fool . If he had said eight o'clock , they could have spent the day together , and part of the night , too : seventeen hours in all , for he counted them , one by One . And now their hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he would dash up madly to the house and summon her and they would go away . But he could never do that . He went to the house and stared at the clock and he hated it . He was infuriatedby its round face and by the smug precisenessof everything it did . For fifteen years he had hated clocks . His mother came out , brushing her hair . She looked at his doleful face and laughed . " Why son , what 's the matter ? Why you up at daylight ? " He looked at her and blew his nose , twisting it so savagely that he felt a stabbing pain . " I do n't know , " he said . " When you to meet her ? " " One o'clock . " " And it 's only five-thirty now ! " She smiled at his woe and came over and kissed his cheek . " Love is an awful thing , ai n't it ? I do n't know , son , if it brings more sorrow or joy . " He left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its bank and watched its silver acres rolling to the sea . His mood was a strange one : intense in its longing , tragically sad : a need to weep , to pray , somewherefar down in his joy ; a mist of pain , a bright searching loneliness of soul . It seemed so queer that his eyes should be wet now . In a little while he would see her and walk with her through the golden hours ; and yet his need , the great ache of his being , seemed to go out and beyond . It was a terrible hunger that made him reach to what he had never heard of , toP143build his dreams on what he could never find : as if Neloa were only a stepping-stone to the light ... . When he returned , the family was eating but Vridar did not eat . He watched them with his heart bursting . Only music , only the sadness of violins , was an answer to this pain in his heart . " You better eat , " Joe said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in love I could n't eat . " Vridar 's grin was sick and tortured . All eyes turned to him : curious or sympathetic or amused . " If you do n't eat , " Mertyl said , " you 'll have rumblings in your stomach . You ca n't make love with all that noise . " " No , " Joe said , " you ca n't make love on a empty st umick . " " In a few hours , " resumed Mertyl , " a steak will taste bettern a kiss . " This statement so amused Diana that she choked on a biscuit and left the room . She came in , coughing and giggling , and suddenly her laugh pitched into a shrill wail and died . " When I fall in love , " she said , " I 'll sure eat . I 'll jet so fat and big he ca n't hug me . " Vridar looked at her plump body , already omanly in its fullness . " You wo n't have to eat much more , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Joe . " Mush is what you need to make love . " All this jesting Vridar thought in poor taste . Itseemed to be the way of persons  --  of most persons , atleast , whom he knew  --  to make a silly monkey oflove . It was the glory of earth ; but not for his father'speople , the Hunters , the O'Rourkes , the McGards :   for them it was a lewd adventure that begat babies and consternation . And he remembered all the obsceneclowning during his school days in Annis . He went outside and walked . His love would be strained of all impurity and would flow in soft light . Such wooing as he had often seen  --  prancing like a stallion and biting and whinnying or climbing naked to a stump and roaring in amorous thunder , in the manner either of Dock Hunter or Borg Swensenwouldnever be his . And how anyone could make of love nothing but vulgar postures of mating was one of the dark riddles of life . It ought to be soft and tremulous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be what song was to a bird , sunrise to the morning .... Yes , for him and for Neloa , love would be like that . It would be the fragrance of their commonmood and the light of what they said . He got his pony and mounted . The time was still early but he could linger on the way . After going up the dugroad , though , he did not linger , but gave rein to the pony and went like the wind . The sky was a glorious blue pasture and the mountains were banked to it in purple mist . Larks sang in cove and dell and fields of wheat dimpled under the breeze . Upon coming to Antelope Creek he rode westwardand stopped a half-mile from Neloa 's home . He looked at the sun but it was still journeying across a mellow forenoon . Going upon a hill , he peered over at the Doole buildings , waiting a long while for Neloa to appear ; and when she did not , he returned to the highway and took a road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to a jungle of aspen , P145and here he sat for a few minutes , looking over the Antelope Hills . Black Canyon was a great secret of forest and mist , and upon northern peaks , clouds were piled like hills of wool , with a warm pink fireplace in their lower bank . Far into the east , he could see Swan Valley , like a darkness lost under blue veils . Around him were flowers , many of them nameless to him ; but he found harebells and geraniums and gilias , and he thrust a few gilias into his lapel . It seemed to him now that the sun had passed its zenith . He rode back to the highway and galloped west . After rounding a curve he stopped , overwhelmed by insupportable joy . He dismounted and led his horse ; and in a few moments , he saw Neloa far down the road , coming slowly toward him . His heart now shook him so that he could see the flowers tremble under its beat . This meeting was to be another picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death as one of the most vivid things of his life . He walked down the road leading the pony and she came toward him , looking very queenly , yet very girlish , too . He saw that she wore a simple pink dress end that her hair fell over it in dark wealth . He saw'at she was smiling and that her eyes were full of light . This he saw , this he never forgot , though everything around him was phantomland . And as into aist , as through a strange dream , they came together , With the earth and the sky gathering into the moment . Nothing in his life had ever been more unreal than this meeting . Everything was impalpable blue wonder , and in this wonder he said hello and she answered , but seemed to him that neither spoke . She came into his trembling arms , but this also was very unreal . He kissed her and he remembered afterward that they both laughed . Then they turned and walked down the road . They left the road and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they looked down over mountainous blue at a river of light . They had walked a mile and neither had spoken . It seemed to him there was nothing to be said . The silence was perfect and the day was shimmering glory ; and they were alone . Now and again he glanced at her , still doubting that she was with him . There was a lustrous splendor in her eyes , the heart of springtime in her cheeks . Her mood was his mood , deep and wordless ; her thoughts were his . So it seemed to him : and he was afraid of such happiness : it was too profound and complete . Leading to the river was a dugway and they took its path . They crossed bottomland and came to the river and then Vridar tethered his pony and they sat on the bank . They both looked into a swirling eddy that lay under their feet . Then Vridar looked at Neloa and reached out and touched her hand . " I thought the days would never go , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Into her dark eyes now , as in later whiles , came something that baffled him . As nearly as he could ever put the thing into words it was this : a brightness of love , of hunger , and beyond these , a single question fixed in loneliness : one dark solitary fear , against which , as against a backdrop , her soul stood in silhouette . She looked at him and he saw this strangenessP147written in her eyes , and then her lashes fell . He was troubled a little by what he saw but he was too happy to ponder what it meant . " Neloa , you love me still ? " " Yes . " " Come here . " He drew her to him across his lap , with her hair falling over him and over the earth . She looked up at him and then closed her eyes . He looked at her mouth and wanted to kiss it and did not dare . " You happy now ? " " Yes . " " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled and glanced up at him and her lashes fell again . She talked very little , he reflected ; most of her answers were only yes . But he did not likeiris who talked . Born to silence and always afraid of t , yet he loved its worth , sensing in it the far-reachingand the eternal . And for a long while now he did not speak again . He gazed down at her , thinking of her loveliness and trying to convince himself that this hour was real . He looked at her body , at her lovely bare arms , at the fullness of her breasts ; but there was nothing amorous in his gaze . Her lying against him stirred no passion : tenderness only , a wish to cherish and protect , a prayer for so much that was his . Her breathing was slow and deep but he could tell by her face that she was not so serene as she seemed . Lifting her a little , he bowed his face to her hair . " Neloa , remember the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . "   " That was long ago . How long ? " " Oh , seven years  --  eight years . " " Ten years and ninety-eight days today . " " Have you counted all the days ? " " A thousand times . . . . And I followed you to school . Or did you know that ? " " Yes , I knew . " " And how I watched you all day long . But you did n't know that . " " No . " " And remember when I walked home with you ? I tried to , I mean . " " Yes , I remember . " " I was awfully silly . But I loved you so much , even then . " She stirred in his arms and clasped one of his hands . This response shook him : it was the first of its kind today . " And the school contest ? We stood in the frontof the room and you had your hair down like this . " " Yes . I missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then you went outside and wept . " " I was silly , too . " " I wanted to kiss you then .... And remember the show in Rigby ? " " Yes , I remember . " " You were awful , " he said . " You ran off and left me . " " I was just a little girl . I was a kid then . " " You 're still a little girl . You 're only sixteen . " " I 'm a pretty big little girl . I feel big as a house . " " Would you like to be smaller ? "  | " I do n't want to be a mountain . I get bigger and bigger . " " You 're just right , " he said . " I would n't want to change you a bit . " Again they were silent for a long while . Very stealthily , Vridar drew from his pocket a pair of small scissors and severed a lock of her hair . He stored the lock away and returned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , he watched the surge and foam below him or he worshiped her face , and each bewildered glance at her fetched another sigh . It was ridiculous to think that Neloa loved him , and et it was so . He had kissed her only once today . Heanted to kiss her again : not with passion , but only to make certain that he could , that it was his right to o so . Drawing a handful of hair to his lips , he kissed t ; and then he took her free hand and kissed it and pressed it to his cheek . " You know what ? " he said , with a strange selfityinglaugh . " No . What ? " " I want to kiss you . " She looked up at him , her eyes wide and bright . " Why do n't you ? " she said . " I  --  I guess I 'm afraid . " He hoped she would draw him down and kiss him , acting on a wild impulse ; but she did not . Spontane-y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studicd his face . He flushed and turned from her . " That is n't fair ! " he cried . " You'n kiss me if you want to , " she said . P150He looked at her and the blood was hot in his cheeks . " If I want to ! I do n't want to unless  --  " He frowned at her , feeling very wretched . His vanity rose from its dark depths and overwhelmed him with self-pity . " I do n't think you want me to , " he said . One of her most charming mannerisms was a scowl full of humor and light . She scowled at him now and tried to shake him ; she rebuked him with eyes mocking and intent . " I do n't , " he said stubbornly , and felt himself sinking into a bog . He was spoiling the hour and the fault was his . He wanted to say he had been a fool but out of desperation , vanity rose again in a moment of triumph . " I just judge by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Like you do n't want me to ! " he cried dismally . He sat up and stared at an eddy of foam . Again she shook him a little . " Kiss me . " " I do n't want to . " That was a horrible lie but it made him feel better . Well , if he had to , he could go alone through life , solitary and misunderstood . He could be a desolate titan , overlooking the peaks . . . . But these impossibilitiesgave him no comfort . They darkened the sky and made him shiver . Neloa now sat up and tossed her long hair back . She studied his face ; and then , like one who despairs of winning , she strove to draw him to her . He resistedand wished himself dead . Why did he alwaysp151have to be a stupendous fool ! Still , he was not going to ask for every kiss , fall to his knees and implore , make a beggar of his love . He had pride : where were her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and it was the first time he had ever heard her speak his name . " What ? " he said . He looked at her . She was staring at him as if he were an insoluble riddle . It helped a little to know that he baffled her . " Why wo n't you kiss me ? " " Why should I ? " And with his heart threshing wildly , he added : " If you do n't want me to , why ould I ? " " Who said I did n't want you to ? " " I did . " Again she studied him . Her eyes were neither cold nor hurt : they were only baffled . And Vridar , feeling that she would never break down his will , never rich through his absurd mask and heal the hour , fell to bitter words . " You do n't love as I love ! I 'm an idiot , a plainfool ! I worship you , I 've worshiped you for years , but I wish I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was so vehement now that his words , his stingingunkindness , poured out of him in a great breath . Hegot to his feet and looked down at her and spokeagain . " What do you know of love like mine ? Whatwill you ever know ? I would die for you , I wouldmy heart out for you , now ! anytime ! Everythingbut you , your clothes , the dust on your shoes , means more to me than life ! And what do you care !   And what do you care ! I ought to hate you ! In God 's name I wish I could ! Oh , I wish I could ! " He stopped , white and exhausted ; and Neloa now rose , a little pale and shaken , and looked at him . With the right word , the quick warm impulse , she could have broken him to tears and to wild penitent devotion ; but she did not understand him  --  his passionate idealism , his loneliness , his violence . Unimpulsive herself , she could only stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful destroying power of his scorn . He started for the river , half-determined to throw himself in . Then he swung and faced her . You mean life to me , " he said , his eyes dark and burning , his lips white . " All of life , that is what you mean . When I said I 'd die for you , I meant it . When I said I worship you , I meant it . But if you do n't love me I do n't want you . I 'd rather you 'd leave me now . I 'd rather He broke off , amazed . Her eyes were wet . He saw mist in them first and then tears that gathered to her lashes and fell . She looked at him through her tears . " I do love you , " she said . " Neloa ! Oh , Neloa ! " And now , unable longer to control the flood , he dropped to earth and let his desolate grief find its peace . For several minutes the anguish poured out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one whose years were still lost in terrorand loneliness , whose mind still lived in an awful dark exile of its own . " Vridar , " she said : but she did not try to quiet his grief . She did not touch him . She waited until hep153was spent . Then she sat by him in quiet humility , and he sat up , loathing himself . After a few moments he looked at her . If he had seen in her face the smallest hint of scorn , of amusement or of doubt , he would have left her here and walked out of her life . But he saw none of these . Her eyes were sad and questioning . With a cry he threw himself to her lap and put his arms round her and shook again.  | AND SO these weeks passed , each with its six days of intolerable waiting , each flowering in glory at its end . Had it not been for his father , Vridar would have gone oftener , riding out in any evening when his heart was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once in seven days , he said , was often enough to see any woman . When he courted , he had gone only on Sunday , spending the other days in the fields . A lot of men wasted themselves in love . When Sunday came , Vridar was up at daylight and without breakfast he was off , meeting Neloa at sunrise . They would spend nearly eighteen hours together ; and when midnight fell , he would gallop home to face another eternity of waiting . Always they went over the hills to the river and spent the hours there . And these Sundays  --  there were nine of them  --  were all perfect save one . In the calm morning of this day , while night was still a faint fog in cove and glade , they were going down Antelope Creek . They left the road and turned into a river-lane and climbed a hill ; and upon looking back they saw a man filling his tank from the creek . He was a farmer and he was hauling water to his beasts . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . But when he looked at Neloa , he saw that her eyes were curiously alive ; and with unerring penetration , born of loneliness and self-searching , he read in her eyes , in something strangely shadowed there , a warm alert interest in this man . His world darkened , as if the sun of his happiness had passed into a cloud . P155He grasped her shoulders and looked at her eyes but what he had seen there was gone . And then she amazed him by saying : " I know who he is . " " Who who is ? " asked Vridar , beginning to feelt . She inclined her head to the distant man . Heked at her and at the man , at one and then at theCher , and he wondered what her words meant . And the man was now looking at them . " Well , who is he ? " " Francis Henderson . " " Oh , you do n't say ! Well , who 's Francis Hen-rson ? " " He lives over there , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man now waved to Neloa and she returnedgreeting and jealousy rose in Vridar in a vomit of rage . It choked him and for a few moments left him speechless . He stared at Neloa , sick with doubt . in ! perceiving now that he was furious , she changed suddenly , in the manner of a playing child that is baked . Something strange entered her eyes and c smile left her mouth . " Let 's go on , " she said . " No , " Vridar said . He was determined to settle is matter now . " How long you known him ? " " Oh , about a year . " " You been out with him ? " His face was so morally earnest that she shrank and looked scared . " Yes , " she said . " I low many times ? " " Only once . " " Only once . When was that ? "   " Oh  --  " She sighed . " About two months ago . " " How long before  --  before you came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . " She was annoyed . Her voice trembled now and there was dark resentment in her eyes . " Do you love him ? " " Do n't be silly ! " she said , and her eyes for a moment were like fire . Vridar had never seen this Neloa before . He was touching depths that he had suspected but had never found . He drew a long breath , feeling that he was silly beyond all doubt . She had gone with him once , she had waved to him in greeting ; but these , surely , were no matters to get furious about . He took her arm and they walked again . She was pensive and sullen now : if he pressed her arm , she gave no response ; and he wished deeply that he had not been such a fool . " I 'm sorry , " he said . He looked round , trying to meet her eyes . There was an angry dying flush in her cheeks . There was something hard and glittering in her stare . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you so . " " You were mean , " she said . " All right , anything . But let 's not spoil our Sunday . . . . Neloa , please ! " She did not sigh or in any way betray her thought . Her face was still brooding and dark . He stopped and drew her resisting to his arms and she put her hands up and strove to push him away . " Neloa , please ! I 'm awful sorry , honest . Please do n't spoil our day ! " She looked at him and he didP157not like what he saw in her eyes . He had seen it in her father 's eyes . He had never discovered what it meant . " Neloa ! " he cried , becoming frantic . " What ? " she asked , and looked far away . " Neloa , do n't you love me now ? " She hesitated a long while . " Neloa ! Do n't you ? " " I guess so , " she said . " Then please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neloa , please smile . " " No ! " " Yes . Please ! " " I said no . " He drew her to him again and she did not resist now . He kissed her lips and eyes . " Smile ! " he said . " I 'll kiss you until you smile . " She looked at him and Very slowly she smiled . The darkness left her eyes andere came in its stead a whimsical humor that he loved . " Now we 're all right , " he said . " Neloa , are n't we ? " But not for hours did he recover the lyric sweetnessof their former days . Something troubled her . Her gayness , never bright or spontaneous , touched her but lightly now , and her eyes , again and again , were shadowed and still . But he reposed in her , largely because his need was so great , the simplicity and the trust that were the heart of his life . And another incident , also trifling , it seemed to him on reflection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw her only on the Sundays of these weeks . But on the Mormon holiday , the twentyfourthof July , he mounted his pony and rode forth ,  |p158telling  himself with enormous glee that he would surprise her . When he came within sight of her home he stopped . He saw Neloa in the yard , and she saw him , too , it seemed , because at once she dodged round a building and entered the house . He rode down the lane and through the gate . After greeting her parents , who stood in the yard and looked at him , as they always did , rather curiously , he threw the reins over a post and went to the door . " Is Neloa inside ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Tim Doole . He pushed the door open and strode in . Neloa was lying on a bed . She seemed to be asleep but he knew she was not . Nevertheless , when he spoke to her she did not answer and when he went over and sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " you 're not asleep . " She affected to wake and to be astonished . She stared at him and blinked her eyes ; and her acting was so silly and artless that he did n't know whether to be furious or to laugh . " When did you come ? " she asked ; and she rubbed at wide-awake eyes . " When did I come ! You saw me coming . Why do you act this way ? " " I guess I was asleep , " she said . " You were n't . You were out in the yard and you ran in here to pretend . . . . Neloa , why did you do it ? " " Do what ? " " Pretend this way . " And now she affected anger . She rose from theP159bed and went to a mirror and brushed her hair . He followed her . " Neloa , why ? " She tried to look at him with scorn but her eyes were guilty . " What makes you think I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you lie ? " " I did n't . " " Listen , have you ever lied to me before ? " " I 've never lied to you . " " Except today . " " No , not today . I was asleep . " " That 's a lie ! If you 're going to lie to me  --  Well , suit yourself . " He got his hat and moved toward the door . She came toward him , swift and wild . She grasped his arm and tried to drag him away from the door and he allowed her to . But when he faced her , she did not speak . She merely looked at him , her eyes guilty and anxious . " I do n't want you , " he said . " I do n't lie . I do n't want a liar . " She laughed , and her laugh was strange and low , tremulous and dark . She strove to draw him to the bed and he scowled at her and refused to budge . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and she went over and sat down . He stood in wretched doubt , staring at her . If she would only talk instead of sinking into this awful silence ! " Neloa , tell me why you did it . " He waited but she did not speak . He turned to the door again and she was after him , frantic in her haste . He grasped her chin and forced her gaze to his . " Why ? " he said . " Oh  --  I wanted to see what you would do ! " Her tone was full of vexation and grief .   And now Vridar felt , as in the former matter , that it was he who had been silly . She had only been playing , had wanted to see what he would do ; and he had threshed about in fury , trying to make a mountain of this molehill . He took her hand and led her outside and down the road . But save for these two incidents , his ten days with her were as flawless as light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by doubt , by loneliness , he would fly into a rage and rebuke her ; he would declare that she was only playing with him ; and he would get himself into such a rage of panic and despair that he would have to throw himself to the earth and weep . But these explosions of temper only heaped sweetness upon the hours that came after . Then he would lie in her lap or take her to his arms , and his peace , in contrastwith his madness , would be deep beyond words . Then he would know beyond all question that his love for her was utter and that life without her would be worse than death . And not always did he maneuver the day into a tantrum . Often they gathered wild flowers , breathingof the gentian and gilia and fireweed , of aster and golden rod , of mimulus and cinquefoil and rose . Or he would put a yellow rose in her dark hair or he would press rose petals to her lips and then to his . Or they would sit by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trout . And often they climbed to pine trees and gathered gum and chewed it and breathed the smell of ripe chokeberries and of evergreen . In all these doings , there was so much tenderness and peace that he would marvel at life , having suddenly found it so clean and good . P161Nor at any time during these days with her did Vridar hunger for her body or feel any hint of passion , even when she lay in his arms . The purity of his love , its unalloyed soulfulness of power and thought , was so very extreme that it came to be for him , in a later time , the most incredible circumstance of his life . Not even when he kissed her did he have a consciouswish to do more . Because for him she was like the flowers and the sky , like the evenings and the mornings , and he could no more have proposed intimacy , or have wished it , than he could have taken his own life . His desire was to protect her and to worshipher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his testaments and his prayer.  | THE FLAVOR of his love it to be found most amazingly in an experience that fell in August . It happened in this way . Neloa said she had to go to Idaho Falls to nurse a relative , and if Vridar wanted to see her on the following Sunday , he would have to see her there . He said he would . He rode down with the mail carrier and met her in the railway station , two hours after dark . She smiled and came toward him but he did not take her in his arms here . Too many persons stood around and there was too much light . Without speaking , save as his trembling body spoke or his eyes , he led her to a street and they walked into town . He was troubled by the thought that she would leave him soon and he would have to spend the night alone , and as they turned from street to street , he wondered how he could keep her with him . He was willing to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to do that . The night was warm , and he wanted to go into the country and sit somewhere under trees ; but this , too , he imagined she would think a foolish thing to do . Besides the bench or the country , there was nothing but a hotel . " Neloa , when do you have to go ? . . . I mean where you 're staying . " " About midnight , I guess . " They passed a drugstore and he peered in . " It 's ten now . That 's only two hours . " " Mebbe I can stay till one . " " That 's only three hours . . . . Neloa , why can'tP163you stay with me all night ? " She looked at him in astonishment . He pressed her arm . " Why not ? It would n't be wrong , would it ? We could go to a hotel . " She did not answer . He thought she was horrified by such a notion and he pleaded for it , urging its right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love and they would be married and it was their own business what they did . They could get two rooms . He had enough money for two rooms . They could sleep alone , but he would be near her , even though a wall lay between . " Will you ? I ca n't let you go in three hours . I wo n't . . . . Neloa , say you will . " " I do n't know . " " Why do n't you know ? " " I should go back , I guess . My aunt is quite sick . " " But you would go to bed . Would n't you ? What difference would it make ? " " I do n't know . " She drew away from him and went to a window . She looked at dresses , spread in piles of color under a light . Vridar was annoyed . How could she look at these , when another matter , so vast and important , weighed on their souls ! " That 's a pretty dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I guess so , " he said ; and he scowled at an overflowingmass of pink taffeta . They went down the street and Neloa stopped at other windows , and Vridar wondered how she could spend their precious hours in such utter silliness . He felt resentful and wished he had n't come . " Will you ? " he said.  | " What ? " she said , gazing at a velvet skirt . " You know what . Will you ? " " I do n't know . " " Neloa , please ! " They walked again . He saw in her eyes a bright hunger for lovely things . At a jeweler 's window she stared earnestly at brooches and rings , bracelets and necklaces and watches , lavallieres and beads . She said she wanted a lavalliere and he said he would buy her one when he could . Then he took her arm and led her away . But she turned as a child does , looking at every bright thing in the street . It seemed to him that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he led her into a drugstore and to a booth . He gave her the menu and he could see her eyes brighten as she read . " What do you want ? " he asked . She chose ice cream , dressed with marshmallow and pecans  --  a dish , it seemed to him , that looked terribly expensive  --  ; and he chose a plain soda , havingnoted its low price . Whether he would now have money for two rooms and for his journey home , he did not know ; and his worries multiplied as he watched her eat . She was excited tonight , not by him , he realized , but by the life around her ; and she looked very lovely , with her eyes shining and with so much color in her cheeks . " You have n't answered , " he said . " Neloa , will you ? " " Mebbe , " she said . Her eyes for a moment were very dark and wide . " Say yes . " " Yes . " P165He forgave everything now : her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbaric and detestable , and her misuse of their hours . That she would spend a night with him , in spite of her shyness and innocence , was overwhelming proof of her love . She trusted him and put herself in his care and that was enough . On their way out , he fell behind and ; and when he saw that it was only thirty cents , he felt more at ease . He smiled at the cashier and said good evening as if he were a worldly fellow who knew his way about . The time now was eleven and he hunted the Streets , seeking an unpretentious hotel . Most of themd magnificent lobbies . Their guests , stretched out in lordly chairs , looked snobbish and bored . He would have to find a small hotel , rather dark andahoy , and he pretended that it would be best to do . In the larger hotels , he said to Neloa , they mightrecognized . " I know one , " she said . " I stayed in it once . " " Where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himIfstaring at a building that was very gloomy and ill . He hesitated , wondering if the rooms were an ; and then , summoning all his courage , he took r arm and opened a door . They climbed a dark airway and came to a small desk , feebly lighted , d he read a sign which asked him to push the buttonthis right . His heart was beating terribly now . His hand shook when he pressed the button and he feltguilty and lost .   From a dark corridor on the right came a huge woman . Her face , it seemed to him , was lewd and adulterous ; her voice was sharp . " Well ? " she said , and looked at Vridar . " Do you  --  have any rooms ? Vacant rooms ? . . . I  --  want two . " " Two ! " she said , and looked at Neloa . You see , " he went on , " I  --  well , we 're not married , you see . We 're engaged , I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see she 's down here nursing and I  --  I  --  well , I came down to see her . I live on Antelope . . . . We just want a-be close together . . . . If you have two rooms  --  " He broke off . The woman 's shrewd eyes were looking clear through him . " I got only one room , " she said . " Only one ! " Vridar cried . His heart sank . " You sure you got only one ? " The woman was now staring at Neloa . " You'n have it . " " But we 're not married ! " Vridar cried . Her smile was faint and sardonic . She looked at him and he felt chilled . " It will be a dollar and a half for two . " Vridar turned to Neloa , wondering what she thought of this . Her eyes were bright and her face was a little flushed . And then it occurred to him that they could take the room and Neloa could sleep and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Sign here , " the woman said . Vridar signed his name and Neloa 's name and his hand shook so that his own writing was strange toP167him . The woman got a key and led the way into a black corridor . She unlocked a door and ushered them into a room that smelled of old bedding and dust . She turned a light on and looked at Vridar a moment and went over and drew the shade . Then she went out and softly closed the door . Vridar did not turn to Neloa at once . He was too astounded by his boldness and too afraid that he was unwise . What did she think of him , fetching her alone to a room and asking her to spend the night with him ! He walked about the room , pretending to examine this and that but really fighting against a sense of shame . For several minutes he did not look at her . And when he did , he was surprised to see how happy she looked and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night together , and if t here was greater happiness on earth , he could notimagine what it was like . " Neloa , you 're not mad at me ? " " No . " He took her in his arms and kissed her and then cy both sat on the bed . She laid her head to his colder and he put an arm round her waist . For several minutes they sat this way . " I guess she thought we were up to mischief . Sheacted like it . " Neloa did not answer . Vridar wishedwould talk a little more and not keep so muchf herself deeply hidden . He went over to the onein y window and peered behind the shade and intostreet . And he was aware now for the first timethat the woman had drawn this shade and looked atshim with cunning eyes . Well , she was a fool . Shethought that if a man took a woman to a room he was bent on sin , and in this matter she had much to learn yet . She thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What she did not know about life would take a long time to tell ; and he drew a great sigh and felt proud of himself . He came back and sat on the bed . Neloa seemed flushed and excited but he did not blame her , so incrediblewas the thing he had done . He would be very gentle with her and she would feel more at ease in a little while . " Neloa , you do n't love me any less , do you ? " " No , " she said , and she gave him a strange dark look . He framed her face in his hands and forced her gaze to meet his . He could not read the meanings in her eyes . Very rarely had he been able to . So much was there now , so much had always been there , written in the soft and inscrutable depth . " Are you sleepy ? " " No , just a little . " " Would you like a drink ? " " Yes . " He went over to the dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then filled with water . He brought it to her and she thanked him and swallowed a little , and he reflected that she was not thirsty at all . He wondered what else he could do to make her feel at ease . Turning the cover back , he examined the bed : the mattress was old and uncleanand rotten , the springs sagged . The covering was unclean , too . He hoped there were no bedbugs or lice . P169Neloa was very quiet with her gaze fixed on the wall . He sat by her and took her hands . What should he talk of now ? " Do you want to lie down ? " She glanced at him and then at the bed . He folded the pillows and lay against them and drew her to his arms . She could sleep like this , he said . He would lie awake and look at her and see to it that she was warm ; and he laughed a little , thinking how absurdly happy he was . Neloa gave no answer to this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was thinking . Out in the hall he could hear a woman 's protests and a man 's angry voice and he went over to lock the door . But there was no key , no latch. c stood a chair on its heels and propped the door and came back . The man was loud and abusive and the woman cried as if in pain ; and then steps went down the hall and the building was silent . Vridar looked at Neloa to see what she made of this . " Sounds like a quarrel , does n't it ? " " Yes . " He turned the light off and the room was very dark . Telling Neloa she had better sleep now , he drew covers back and she kicked her shoes off . She lay on the bed and he put a quilt over her ; and then , after taking only his shoes off , he lay at her side and put an arm round her . But he lay without cover , feeling that it would be indecent , even with clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if she was warm ande said she was . After a little while , he became aware that his arm was lying against her breast . He movedit down to her waist . She lay on her back and he lay on his side , with hisarm round her over the quilt , with his face in her hair . Her hair was clean and fragrant and he loved the smell of it . He kissed her hair and he wanted tokiss her mouth but he did not . Perhaps she was toosleepy for kissing now . " Are you all right ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . " You happy ? " " Yes . " He felt very tender and protective , as if they were lost in an alien world and she was his to defend . She would sleep but he would not . All night he would lie awake , thinking of her , trying to realize that she was here . When they were married he would lie with her in every night and smell of her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him had always been so terrible in its pain and loneliness and now it was so clean and sweet . It made him weep to think of it . In a little while she slept . She turned to her side away from him and he moved his face close to her , but not his body , and he thought of how innocent she was and how she trusted him . Well , it would always be like this . Their life together would be a soft glory , a warm splendor of light , across the years . And he sighed again , for his heart was very full . He became sleepy after a while but he did not sleep . His hours with her , so few in each week , must all be given to realization and thought . If he were to sleep , he might as well be in China , he might asP171well not have come . No : he would lie here and listen to her breathing and tell himself over and over how much he loved her and how happy he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream until morning acne . Again and again he kissed her hair , piled round is cheeks , and he gathered it and covered his face ' kb it ; or he rose to look at her sleeping face ; or c patted her arm and kissed it as , in years gone by , he had kissed the Bible . And he despised himself a little because his eyes were wet . And when morning came , Neloa still slept , and Vridar lay by her , worshipful and awake .   BUT THIS interlude in Vridar 's life came to a suddenend . It had been a fragrant morning and a calm noon , overhung by a golden sun ; and on the Wednesday evening after his night in Idaho Falls , the sun dropped into darkness and he was again lost . At three o'clock of this day , everything seemed perfect ; and at ten o'clock , he had suffered the most terrible disillusionment of his life . As strange as lightning in a clear sky came its first intimations , and then , flash by flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he went home like a crazed man , with something in his heart that was always to be there . Unable to wait for Sunday , he had ridden out and had gone with Neloa upon the hills . Leaving the dugwaythey went down over a bluff and into heavy timber and here for a long while they sat under a huge pine . And it was here that Vridar did a childish , a most ridiculous , thing . Credulous , yet suspicious , and with jealousy that could become insane , he had never convinced himself of Neloa 's love . Not that he had any reason for doubt . She went with no other man and she was always happy to see him and she yielded to the shapingpower of his will . It was something which he felt in her : in her eyes at all times , often in her voice , sometimes in her way . And at last , unwilling to live forever in doubt , he decided to test her love . Because he was proud and lonely of temper and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess , he resolved to lie to her about his love/life . And under this tree after much hesitation he spoke . " Neloa , I have something to tell you . It 's an awful confession and I guess you wo n't love me any more . But we ca n't get married with any secrets between us . . . . Can we ? " " No , " she said . " It happened last winter , " he said , staring at his hands . " I was pretty wild , I guess . . . . Well , anyway I ran around with a girl . She fell in love with me . She said she did . She wanted to marry me . We went to shows and dances . . . . Well , I was with her a lot . " He glanced at Neloa . She was looking at him with something dark and unfathomable in her eyes . He toyed with a stick , both because he wished to seem ill at case and because he was ; and then , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to read the effect of his words . " Well , there is n't much to say . We  --  I  --  the truth is I was intimate with her . " He saw Neloa catch her breath a little . He saw a strangeness in her eyes . It was like pain but it was more than pain . " Well , " he went on , determined to make this a real test , " she , the girl , I mean  --  well , she 's going to have a child . It 's my child . " Now he saw her eyes darken and then become bright and wet , and tears gathered to her lashes and fell . Her mouth trembled a little . But she did not speak ; she only looked at him , as if hurt beyond the power of cure . And he wanted to cry that he had lied and that he loved only her , and so take the pain out of her eyes ; but he must be very sure . " Neloa , will you marry me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then her eyes were blinded and she broke to the earth and wept . More than all else in life , Vridar wished to comfort her ; but he sat apart and listened to her grief . After a little while she looked at him again . " Neloa , will you ? " She gave no answer . She looked away from him and tears rolled down her cheeks . " I love you , Neloa . I did not love this other girl . I do n't want to marry her . . . . And I know I 've sinned . If you tell me to go , I 'll not blame you for that . . . . Neloa , shall I go ? " Again she looked at him . He rose to his feet and started away and as he did so she made a choked sound and bowed to earth . He went a little way up the mountain and looked back at her . For several minutes he stood here but she did not look up . " Neloa , shall I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell that she was shaking with grief . Going a little farther , he turned again . " Neloa , I am going now ! " He went through trees , glancing back from time to time , but she did not raise her head . He was out of sight and he was convinced that she intended to let him go when he heard her voice ringing in his name . He waited and she came frantically toward him but when she saw him she stopped . He went down the mountain and faced her . " Neloa , shall I go ? " She gazed at him and her eyes were dark and strange . She was trembling , and never , he reflected , had he seen her so deeply moved . But she did not speak . " Shall I ? " P175He went up and touched her arms . With a palmto her chin he forced her eyes to meet his and forseveral moments he looked into their wet darkness . They told him nothing that he wanted to know . " Neloa , shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . With a cry of gladness , Vridar took her in his arms and kissed the tears from her eyes . He led her back to the tree and sat there with her lying against him . " Neloa , " he said , " I have another confession . " With a gasp she fought away from him and sat up . He struggled with her and drew her to him . " It was all a lie , " he said , " What I told you was all  --  lie . I swear to God it was . You 're the only girl Iever went with , except once to a show . You 're theonly girl I ever really loved . " He thought she would be overwhelmed by relief but she was not . As a matter of fact , her behavior how completely baffled him . She moved away from him as if his touch annoyed her and she stared into distance for a long while . Vridar searched her face and strove to understand . And at last she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ! " he cried . He grasped her arm and drew qtr to him . " What could you confess ? That you danced with Dave Wolf ? You confess ! " he said ; ml the idea was so preposterous that he laughed . Neloa , you do n't have to test me . I love you . I was ply testing you , that 's why I lied . " She gave no answer to this . She still gazed at the mountain and there was something sad and wistful her gaze . Vridar kissed her and helped her to rise and they went down the mountain and to the river . He was sorry , he said , for his lie . He had been very silly . And he hugged her to him and kissed her with such rapturous devotion that color drenched her cheeks . Three hours later he saw initials carved upon the pale green of an aspen . They had been put there by men , he supposed , and he thought nothing of them . But in the next moment Neloa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He looked up and he saw on the tree ten feet above his head these letters : H.K. N.D. " Whose are those ? " he demanded and stared at her . " N.D. , that 's yours . " She was smiling up at the letters as if very glad to see them there . Vridar looked at her face and a horrible doubt paralyzed him . " H.K. , " he said , " H.K. Who is H.K. ? " " Harvey Kress . " " Kress ! " His heart sank . His thoughts went back to his school days in Poplar and to Alvin Kress , the tawny lad who had wooed Helen and whom he had threshed . " Is he Alvin 's brother ? " " No , his cousin . " Certain for a moment that he was going to faint , Vridar went to a fallen tree and sat down . What was the meaning of this ? And why did Neloa smile so happily when she looked at the carving and when she spoke of this man ? My God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jealous rage filling him . She came overp177and stood before him . The smile had left her face now . She looked frightened and helpless . " You mean , " he said , " you were down here with him ? " She did not answer . In her eyes was that baffling strangeness which had always been there . " Were you ? " he shouted . " Yes . " " When ? " " Oh , last spring a year ago . Last summer it was . " " A year ago ! Did you spend the whole day here ? " " Yes . " " When you were fifteen ! " He strove to think of this . She had been here with I a Ivey Kress and had spent a whole day with him and they had wandered about here like lovers and he had climbed that tree and linked her name with his . And what did all that mean ? What had they said , what had they done ? Vridar stood up and the world was swimming and dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face him . He searched her eyes but their lustrous ' civet told him nothing at all . When he spoke again , his voice was hoarse and choked and his hands shook On her arms . " Did  --  did he ever kiss you ? " And now there Came into her eyes something which he understood . t was cold annoyance , a kind of sly contempt , mixed with bewilderment and fright . It made him shake with fury . His fingers sank into her flesh until she cried with pain but he was remorseless now . " Did he ? " " Yes . " As if struck a blow he released her and sat down . strove to understand this simple fact : that she had been kissed  --  kissed by another man  --  but the meaningeluded him and went off into darkness and became an inexplicable thing . For how could it be so ! She was so guileless and so young : how could it be ! .. . She had been down here , he told himself , sitting with his head bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as she had done with him ; and they had kissed and laughed . He shut his eyes tight and breathed through his mouth , breathing like one in fever ; he shuddered and then was still for a long while . . . . How could it be so ? It seemed so silly to tell him that ! When he stood up he looked haggard and beaten . Without looking at Neloa , he stumbled through brush to a path and found the road . Neloa followed him , keeping many yards behind at first , but narrowingthe distance , little by little , until she walked at his side . He did not look at her . He stared ahead of him up the mountain and in the anguished darkness of his mind he recalled details that had baffled him : her saying that she knew Francis Henderson and the light in her eyes when she waved to him ; and the deep guiltiness of her stare ; and her curt note about her gate and his not swinging on it . And as he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart and laid its waste through his being . He began to feel weak and sick . He began to feel the terrible strangenessof his high school years and awful fancies drew his mind to thoughts of death and murder , and to a black exile of loneliness worse than these . Again and again he strove to think of what she had told him . A kiss itself meant nothing , or very little , but it did no good to tell himself this . It wouldP179take more than a kiss to explain all that leapt into meaning now . And of what she could tell him , his certainty became so appalling that he sat by the road , his head sunk , and tried to steel himself for what must come . For almost an hour he sat here and Neloa stood in the road and waited . Not once did helook at her . Not once did she speak . Darkness came and he rose and walked again and very silently she walked at his side . And he went as one drugged . He tumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heas ; and once he fell and lay for a long while with-t realizing that he had fallen . For his body movedif it had been severed from his mind , and his mindas an intense and isolated darkness of its own . For two miles they walked and neither spoke. hen he came to her home gate and crawled throughd she followed him and he went up the road and entered the barn . He became aware now that he waseating and with a trembling hand he wiped his row . Going over to the manger he leaned into it , inking he would vomit , but he only retched anden felt deathly sick . But it was sickness in his blood , not in his stomach ; and it possessed him fromad to feet . Here by the manger he stood for quite a while. 1 is then bowed his head to the pony and tried torep , feeling that he must get this awful desolationt of him or go mad . But there were no tears in himw . His anguish was too deep and dark and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to be eating his mind away . He knewonly vaguely that Neloa was standing by the door . He tried to realize why she was there and to think of her , but doing so was like probing into a wound and he recoiled , drawing away from her and into the dark . For half an hour he did not move . And then , out of utter despair , came a sudden bright hope . Perhapsshe had been innocent , save only in her kissing and in her rambling with men . He could forgive that , he could take her to his heart and let his grief out ; for his need for her was greater than his pride . And he went over and laid hands on her arms . He turned her so that moonlight fell on her face and for long moments he stared at her ; but what he saw in her eyes and round her mouth left him no hope . His fingers tightened on her arms and he spoke . " Have you ever lied to me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You never asked . " " I never asked ! " Great God , no : his trust had been absolute . " Tell me now . " " What ? " " Everything . " She looked away and he saw the secrets in her eyes . Her eyes , indeed , seemed to be only a black record of untold things . His heart sank . It went down into him like lead . " Tell me . " " What ? " " Everything ! And do n't keep saying what ! " In her eyes now he saw fright . " I do n't know what you want me to tell . " " You 're a liar ! Be quick ! "   " You mean about Harvey ? " " Yes  --  about Harvey . " For several minutes she would not speak . When he clutched her arms she looked annoyed and said he was hurting her . She strove to release his hands . This infuriated him and he shook her so savagely that she gasped . " Stop it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " His voice rang with hatred now . " I 'll kill you in a minute ! All these weeks you 've deceived me , lied to me , made a fool of me ! I 've worshiped you and good God , look ! . . . Hurry up ! " Her gaze was set on the far dark hills . In her faint smile there was contempt for him . He shook her again . " Do n't ! " " I 'll give you a minute ! If you do n't speak I 'll kill you dead ! " " Well , " she said , " it happened last summer . " " What happened last summer ! " " This you want me to tell . " " Go on ! " " I went to the valley with daddy , and Harvey , he went too . We went to Idaho Falls . . . . " " Go on ! " " Well , that night daddy got two rooms , one for c and one for him and Harvey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange light in r eyes . " All right , go on ! " " You'n guess the rest , " she said . " I'n guess the rest ! No ! " he roared , his voice choked with fury and grief . " I wo n't guess ! "   " Do n't , you 're hurting me . " " Go on , I said ! " She shrugged . " Well , when daddy got the rooms , Harvey took the key to my room . He said he would give it to me later . . . . You'n guess what happened . " " I wo n't guess ! Tell it ! " She glanced at him and her glance was scornful . She shrugged again . " Well , Harvey came to my room . . . . I do n't see , " she cried , and there was sudden fire in her voice , " why I got to tell any more ! I guess you'n use your imagination . " " Oh , my imagination ! Yes , yes , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " " How long ? " " Oh , about an hour . " " And what was your idiot of a dad doing ? " She did not speak . " Some father you have ! Jesus Christ , some father ! He takes his fifteen-year-old daughter to the Falls  --  Is n't that the Kress who went on a mission ? " " Yes . " "  --  and turns her over to a Mormon missionary son-of-a-bitch ! " Vridar 's heart was now so wild that he could feel blood surge in his throat . He went over and leaned against the pony and within him everything was a horrible confusion of hatred and pain . He knew that he would break soon , that he could not endure this without some awful violence ; but not until he was through with her , not until he had heard every word . But there stood above his desolation a bright ruthless cunning and a thought of murder . P183He went back and faced her again . He grasped her and swung her to the light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly and his grin was remorseless and diabolic . " How many times ? " " Let me go ! " she cried , and her eyes were like black venom . His fingers sank into her flesh and he broke her to her knees and then lifted her to her feet ; and he saw terror in her eyes . " How many times with him ? " " Two . " " Where was the other ? " " Down by the river . " " Where we were today ? " " Yes . " " And  --  did you stay in the hotel where we stayed ? " " Yes . " He released her , staggered by this blow . She had been intimate with this man , perhaps in a spot where c had sat with her , worshiping her ; and she had led m to the very hotel in which she had been seduced . n this hotel he had lain with her , only ten days ago , chaps in the same room , on the same bed ; and he -- -simple fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had wished only to cherish her and to be with r alone . He stood by the pony and shook with humiliation ml self-loathing . He went back to her , his face kite and awful to look at ; and his voice , without ty for himself now , was implacable and hard .   Is that all ? " " All what ? " " Neloa , do n't fool with me . You understand ? " His words were so gentle , and so terribly ominous in their gentleness , that she shrank back , horrified . She moved as if to flee but he seized her and dragged her back . He broke her to her knees and then slammed her to the wall . He helped her to stand and then forced her eyes to meet his , and when she saw his eyes and the faint grin round his mouth , she cried as if struck and fought to get away . But he held her with one unpitying grasp on her wrist . " Please do n't ! " " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He grinned . " I should say whom else , should n't I ? " " Please let me go ! " " Who else ? " No one . " You lie . " " I do n't lie ! " You do lie . . . . Neloa , do n't you think you 'd better hurry ? " " Oh , please ! " He deliberated and studied her face . You believe in God ? " " Yes ! " " All right , go get a Bible . " " I wo n't ! " " Neloa , you 'd better hurry . " With fearful eyes she looked at him . She backed away from him and then turned and went to the house . And while Vridar waited , he seemed to beP185very calm : he looked round him and saw a pitchfork in one corner and an old shame suspended from a nail ; and he wondered which of these he would use to kill her . He seemed very calm ; but under his calm , he knew very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that waited and beat through him and that would wait only a little while . He could feel now , as he had felt in former years , the dark androbbing might of it . It lay against his control like goods against a dam . Then he heard Neloa coming . She entered the  --  table and laid a book in his hands and he held itmoonlight to be sure of what it was . He told er to place both hands on the Bible and she did. c told her to repeat these words : " I swear to tell the whole truth and nothing butthe truth , and if I do n't , I ask God to send me toerlasting hell . " She hesitated . " Hurry up , say them . " " I  --  I swear to tell the truth " " The whole truth . " " I swear to tell the whole truth and if I did n't " "  --  the whole truth and nothing but the truth . " "  --  and nothing but the truth " Start over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t the truth , and if I do n't , I  --  I " I ask God to send me to everlasting hell . " "  --  I ask God to send me to everlasting hell . " her voice shook and her hands trembled on theBible . " And now , " said Vridar , " keep your hands there and remember how awful it will be to tell a lie on the Bible . . . . What other man you been intimate with ? " She looked far away and caught her breath . " Answer . " " Dave Wolf . " He would have been no more amazed if she had thrust a knife into his heart . With the blackness storming his mind , he turned away . He went to the pony and leaned against him , thinking he would faint ; and he clutched mane to support himself . A violent retching shook him and came up his throat and he wiped bitter froth from his lips . He stumbled back and looked at her . In the voice of a man past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood clasping the Bible and stared at him . " Go on , " he said . " You  --  you mean tell about him ? " " Yes . Go on . " " It was up at Nevel 's . I was teaching his kids . " " When ? " " Last winter . " " Go on . " " I was alone with him and the Nevel kids . Mr. and Mrs. Nevel , they went to the valley . " " How long were they gone ? " " Two days . " " Well , go on . " " That 's all . " " How many times with him ? " " Two . " " Remember where your hands are . " " Only two , so help me God ! " P187Vridar stared at her face , trying to understand . All this was so much to understand , to believe . " Any more ? " " Yes . " He started as if struck . " Great God , you mean there are more than two ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brow , unable to see , barely able to stand . " Who ? " he said at last . " Francis Henderson . " " What ! The man you waved at down on the creek ? " " Yes . " " When ? . . . When ! " he yelled , his voice becominginsane . " About two  --  two weeks before I went up to  --  your place . " This was another blow but he was past all feeling now . Two weeks before she walked with him in Black Canyon , before she promised to be his wife , she had lain with a man . That was what she said . It was very hard to understand it , to see any meaning in it . " Where ? " he asked . " On the bed . " " Oh , bed .... What bed ? " " Just outside our house . " He thought of this bed against the north wall . l le felt a strange impulse to go out and look at it now . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " How many times you go with him ? " " Just once . " " You mean  --  you mean  --  " But why try to think about it ! It was all a part of the darkness now . " Who else ? " " That 's all . " " Oh , that 's all . You 're sixteen and that 's all . It  --  it seems to be enough . " He moved away from the barn but without its support he reeled and had to grasp a log . Again and again he passed a hand over his brow , his mind fumblingand lost , his mind trying to plot his death and hers . A little while ago , it seemed to him , he had thought of a way . He tried to stand alone but he fell in a heap ; and he sat up and supported himself by spreading his legs and putting arms to his knees . " Sit down , " he said . She sat down and laid the Bible in her lap . He strove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mist and he could not see . " Do you  --  love any of these men ? " " No . " " Did they want to marry you ? " " Only Dave . " " Did n't that missionary bastard want to ? " " He never asked me . " " Would you have married him ? " " I do n't know . " " Would you ! " " Mebbe then . But not now . " He sat with elbows to his knees , hands to his hair , still trying to understand . The deep quiet within him was more terrible now . It was the same lone-P189liness , the same dread , that had terrorized his childhood , his youth . For several minutes he neither moved nor spoke , nor did Neloa , and he could hear only his breathing in the profound silence . He was fighting against the power that held him but he knew it was useless to fight . He would have to break into some kind of frenzy and let it out . And suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made was strange and choked ; and then he sprang to his feet and roared . It was violent laughter , empty and desolate . It was furious and wild . He walked round the barn , pouring the frenzy out of him . Then he stopped and the emotion surged up and was dammed in his throat and held there . He threw his arms out , threshing at the air as if strangled ; and with a horrible cry he hurled himself to her lap . He moved away from her and back and again away , trying to release his torture , trying to purge himself with an overwhelming flood of grief or rage . It was grief that saved him . Bowing to her lap , he let it out of him in a convulsion of sound and tears . It beat within him and rose in great gasping sobs and it shook him until he was blind . And out of his grief , as if it had been there all the while , came a wan hope . It was a prayer that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had lied to her . " Make it all a lie ! " he whispered to God . " Oh , please make it all a lie ! " He sat up and looked at her but he could not see . He reached and found her hands and kissed them . He pressed her hands to his cheeks and to his mouth . " Neloa , it 's not the truth ! Darling , say it 's not the truth ! "  | " It is the truth , " she said . " No ! " He grasped her shoulders and for a moment he intended to choke her . " It is n't , I tell you ! It is n't ! " He was frantic now . He wanted to kill her and he looked round for a club but he could see nothing at all . Screaming at her , he said , " Tell me it is n't ! " Struggling free of him , she stood up . He rose , shaking , and faced her , his eyes trying to read what her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazed , he implored her to say she had lied . " Please say it ! Great God , please ! " " I ca n't , " she said , backing away from him . Her voice trembled now . He dashed an arm to his brow and stared wildly round him and he saw the Bible in her hands . He grasped it and told her to place her hands on it and when she hesitated he roared at her with such ungovernable fury that she obeyed . " Swear everything you told me is true ! " he shouted . " I swear everything I told you is true . " For several moments he stared at her . The furious hope died within him and again there was only desolationand dread . He led the pony out and sprang to its back and the pony leapt ahead at full speed . Neloa ran after him , crying his name . He glanced back and saw her stumble and fall . Giving the horse rein , he went wildly through the night , seeing nothing around him but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the long dugway he galloped down it and when he drew up at the house , the pony was white with lather and foam . P191HE TURNED the horse free and went running to the house . There was a light in the kitchen , and when he burst in , he found his parents there as if they awaited him . Prudence sprang up with a cry and even Joe rose to his feet and both of them stared at t his son who looked like a wild man . They asked what had happened but Vridar only strode round the room , k flocking chairs over , acting like a person entirely out of his wits . He sat down and clutched his face and then paced as before ; and again sat down . Prudence talked to him but he did not understand what she said . She strove to stop him in his frantic strides but he pushed her away and he looked at her as if he did not see her at all . Joe then became alarmed and tried to force his son to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leave me alone ! " They left him to his pacing until he was exhausted , until he fell to a chair and began to weep . He shook and moaned , or he would start up , his woe roaring in great sobs , or he would walk round and round the room , fighting the air , striving to calm himself . And when he was quieter at last , though still violently shaken , he told the bitter story of this night . It poured out of him in sobbing , inarticulate words ; he hurled it from him in frenzied gestures ; and when it was all told , he broke down and wept again . His parents were amazed and for a long while they did Spot speak . Then Prudence tried to comfort him but he spurned her gentleness ; because he was deeply ashamed now and he wished he had not told .   He bolted outside and went to the grave of Towser . His mother came out but he roared at her and said he wanted to be alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave and shook . All night he sat here , now goaded to new frenzy , now trying to believe that the confessions had been a dream . When daylight came he walked . He climbed the mountain and went among trees ; he stared at the river , obsessed by a wish to kill himself , and so be done forever with humiliation and grief . Pride told him to renounce Neloa , to spurn her , to forget her . But within him there was a voice stronger than pride , a love stronger than death , a morbid vanity that would see no defeat ; and the more he agonized over the matter , the more convinced he was that he could never spurn her . She had taken hold of his life as nothing else had done . Rather than live without her , he would have chosen death . But his pride , too , was inexorable , and for hours love and pride fought within him , until he was driven beyond his endurance , until he cursed himself and his birth . If he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget how calmly she had told him , how unconcerned she had seemed to be ; nor how abject he had been in his pleading ; nor how stupid he had been during these many weeks . And perhaps he could never humble and chasten her or make her understand how much of self-esteem his being with her must cost him . And if he went without her , what could life be for him save emptiness and loss ! He climbed the mountain and came down and climbed again , trying to wear himself out . He wanted to see her and talk with her : to learn if she had alsoP193wept in agony of soul ; to learn if her dream had been his dream . " To hell with her ! " he shouted . She had given herself easily . She was little better than a whore . Why did he love her and why had he been deceived ! " To hell with her ! " he said . But this cry was so traitorous to his heart , and his need of her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he came down the mountain and went to Diana . She looked at him in amazement . " I want you to go to Antelope , " he said , speaking desperately . " Promise you will . " Diana promised and Vridar resumed . " I want you to take a letter to her . Right now . Will you ? " " I guess so . " " I 'll write it . You get your horse . " He entered the house and again he felt an awful humiliation and wished he had not told . Ignoring his mother , who looked as if she had not slept , he went to a bedroom and sat at a desk . He wrote this letter to Neloa . Dear Neloa : Even if I tried , I could not tell you how deeply I am hurt . I 'll never be the same person again . All night I 've told myself that I should spurn you and I think I should . But I ca n't . In spite of the awful things you have done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see now . I want to know how you feel . Last night you did not seem ashamed of what you had done . I can not love you and I will not marry you unless your regret is deep and lasting . You will have to change your ways and go to school and be the kind of wife I want . You will have to understand what you have done to me and how utterly I believed in you , and you will have to restore that confidence which you have lost . If you will do these things and if you want to do them with all your heart and soul , Diana will fetch your letter . If you do n't want to do them , I will never see you again . VRIDAR . Diana took the letter and rode away and Vridar followed her to the benchland to wait there . Three months ago , he had filed homestead claim to some land here and had built a shack on it and he now went to this shack . Standing in the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take her an hour to go , an hour to return , and possibly she would be there an hour : three hours to wait , three eternities , and with nothing to do . He sat on a log and at once stood up and looked westward and then sat again . After a little , he began to walk but he did not go far . He walked into the east but he kept looking backward to the west . He listened for the sound of a pony 's feet . Going two hundred yards away , he returned , and again went and again returned , completing this aimlessjourney a score of times . Within the log hut he sat on a pile of straw but at once he came out , feeling stifled with a roof over his head . Now he went down the road where Diana had gone and he stared over the western hills . He came back and strove to think , tried to understand what he should do , but it was impossible to think . His whole being was fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoof beats , he would start westward , running down the road ; whereupon , seeing nothing , despising his weakness , he would return to the shack and walk aimlessly or he would look at the sun , trying to tell the hour . What would Neloa write to him ? What would Neloawrite to him ! This was the one , the only , question in his mind . Would Diana find her weeping her heart out and would she write to him her loneliness and her grief ? P195Going again on the hills he circled and came back ; and again he went . And in this manner he spent a desolate and unforgettable day . Diana , it seemed , had been gone years , and he knew she had been gone many hours . The sun was only an hour high now . He took the road westward , breaking from time to time into a run ; and almost unaware of what he did , he covered half the distance to Neloa 's home . He stared down a long gray lane but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and waited and the sun sank and the hills were blue with dusk . Detesting himself for being here , he started home ; but again and again he sat by the road and waited . He hated Diana and he hated Neloa and he loathed himself . Stars were out when he came to the shack . He waited here perhaps a minute , though it seemed an hour , and took the westward road again ; and on a far hill he saw the streak of white in the pony 's face . He ran to meet Diana with his heart intense and smothered in every breath . Looking up to her face , his eyes asked a question , and Diana , with grave pity , looked down at him . " Where 's the letter ? Great God , give it to me ! " " She did n't send any . " " She did n't send any ! You mean  --  you mean she did n't send any ? " " Yes . " " Di , do n't fool with me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't no letter . I asked if she was going to write and she said no . " Vridar stared at her and felt horribly sick . Diana got down and sat on the high bank of the road . Vridar still looked at her . " Set down , " Diana said . " I 'll tell you about it . " Vridar turned and sat , reaching under him for the bank , because not for a moment did he take his gaze from Diana 's face . " Well , first I give her your letter . She took it and read it and then she tucked it in her dress . I watched her face and it did n't seem like she cared much what you wrote . " " What  --  what did she say ? " " Not very much . We went in the house and she helped get dinner . I would n't say she seemed very bothered or upset or ashamed . While we was there , Dave Wolf came in " What ! " Vridar shouted . " Dave Wolf ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolf , " Vridar said , and bowed to his knees . " Go on . " " Well , he stayed for dinner and talked some and that 's about all . I had to wait till he went before I could see her alone . " " And was  --  how did she act with him ? " " Oh , about like she would with any man . They talked and she smiled at him and he smiled at her . They set together when we had dinner . " Vridar stood up in a black world . Only last night she had sent him home crazed and today she sat at dinner with a man with whom she had lain six months ago . It was impossible to understand that . " Di , what else ? "  | " Well , when Dave left I got Neloa alone and said you wanted her to stay with me in Rigby and go to high school . She said she would . I said we 'd go down day after tomorrow and to be ready and she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And  --  and  --  she did n't send any letter ? " " No . I asked did she want to and she said no . " " Did she say anything about  --  last night ? " " No . " " And  --  and you say she acted happy ? " " Well , I would n't say she was heart-broken or anything . She smiled and talked . She acted like she always did . . . . She et a big dinner . " Vridar turned away . He took the road and Diana followed , leading the horse , and on their way to the house nothing was said . Without eating supper  --  he had not eaten since breakfast of the day before  --  he went to bed and lay in silence . Again pride and love fought . Mertyl came in and Vridar saw him undressingin the gloom . He wanted to talk with Mertyland ask his advice , but toward Neloa and toward Vridar 's love for her , Mertyl had shown a strange hostility . He did not seem to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulf between the brothers was wider and darker than before . Mertyl turned to the wall and was soon asleep . Vridar lay in silence , tortured and enraged , his mind turning over pictures of Neloa with Harvey , with Francis , with Dave : seeing her embraced by one and by another , seeing the man 's mouth on her mouth , hearing the man 's words ; until at last he dressed and went outside , feeling murderous . He walked about , plotting the murder of four and of himself ; thinking with dark savage pleasure of their cries for mercy ; and wondering where he could find Harvey Kress . In the kitchen a while later he wrote a scathing letter , born out of hurt pride and hurt vanity , out of loneliness and defeat . It said : Dear Miss Doole : It must seem to you , as it seems to me , that I have been an awful simpleton . You have had a lot of fun with me , but you have taught me much , dear lady , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . I do n't like your gate and I will no longer swing on it . After you are older , you will realize that what you did is the sort of thing that women are usually paid for . In any case , I am ambitious and proud and it would be ridiculous , as even you must see , for me to marry a woman like you . There are women in this world who are not the common property of every man . They do not devote themselves entirely to seduction . And as for you , marry Dave Wolf and live with him in an Antelope shack and have a bunch of kids . Grow old and tragic like your mother and then count your loss . I shall go on . The woman I marry will hate evil as I hate it and will love honesty and truth as I do . But all this , of course , you have no power to understand . P199And flatter yourself , if you want to , with this : I have not eaten or slept for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such relish a few hours ago , I must seem the last word in stupidity . I am . But years ago I fought a worse fight than this one and still kept my feet and I 'll keep my feet again . Let Dave swing on your gate , lady . It 's a fine gate ! VRIDAR HUNTER . He read this letter and then sat and stared at it and then fed it to the lamp . He could no more have sent it to Neloa than he could have cut off his hands . And he knew it . And it was this bitter knowledge that sent him to bed despising himself , heaping scornupon himself , until he sank abject under the witheringderision of his pride . On the next day he resumed the struggle . He little realized that this decision , so difficult to make , was to be the most important of his life . It seemed to be only a choice between love and pride but it was infinitely more than that . If pride had won . . . . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Rigby , there to live with Diana and go to school . The decisionwas made . The second great crisis of his life had been passed . And Vridar went again to college but he was not the credulous youth who had gone the year before . Eating credulity , and hating above all himself and what he had been , he cut free of his old anchors ; and his life for three years became reckless and wild . Betrayedby home-training , made a fool of by devotion to mother and God , he plotted his life toward moral disintegration and the ways of the social outcast . And only his love for his parents , only his loyalty to them , saved him from utter ruin .   AGAIN Vridar lived in the basement den and stoked the furnace and again A. M. McClintock lived in the attic above . As in the year before , Vridar cooked his own meals , laundered his own clothes , and lived in all respects as frugally as he could ; and Mertyl lived with him . He enrolled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself for three weeks to his studies ; he planned for himself a quiet and meditative life . But the plot of his life was now beyond his control . If Neloa , too , had devoted herself to study and had written to him of love and penitence , urging him to forgive and forget , he most likely would have been sober and industrious in this year . He would have forgiven , even though he could never forget ; he would have lost himself in his love of books and scholarship . But Neloa 's letters were not penitent , except when he rebuked her savagely ; and books for her were not and never could be what they were for him . During this while Vridar kept a journal and he set within it all his vanity and bravado , all his bewildermentand doubt . It records how for two months he pleaded or spurned , humbled himself and then threatened , hoped and despaired ; and it records , too , the unwise role of Diana , because it was she who spied on Neloa and wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonight Neloa and I spent an hour together before train time . Sweethearts we part , and perhaps stran-P206gers we shall meet . She promises a letter every week , no matter if I write or not : will she keep that promise ? Her test has started . My fight has begun ! September 18  --  Today Mertyl had his eyes operated on . The operation was terrible but he did not flinch . He will be blindfolded for two weeks . September 22  --  A week has passed and no letter yet ! But what the hell do I care ? I do , I do . Mertyl is bearing up splendidly . What courage and patience he has ! September 23  --  Eight days and no letter . . . . Worked in the department store today . There are some nice girls here . I think I 'll cut loose . Other men sow their wild oats . Am I to be a simple fool all my life , mortgaged body and soul to an adolescent love-affair ? September 25  --  Got two letters today . Neloa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be no humility in her , no shame , no pride . I was a fool two weeks ago and I put my pride under my feet . but I 'll never do it again . Wrote a long letter to Diana . She will keep her eyes open and let me know what is going on . This is the " spray of ice " which Neloa sent : Sweetheart :  --  Well , I am in school and I guess I like it all right . The weather here is awful today : It is cold and windy and I am shivering while I write this . Diana and I get along fine . We both cook and keep the house clean and we usually walk to school together . I have been looking for a letter from you . Well , I do n't want to bore you so will ring off for this time . As ever , NELOA . Vridar remembered now that in her other letters to him , written in former years , she had always closedP207with the statement that she would ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was girlish and silly . And he reflected on the kind of letter Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Robert Browning . Neloa 's letter he decided to burn , but after reading it until he knew it by heart , he kissed it again and again and stored it away . September 29  --  Watched the football squad last night . Am taking boxing lessons with anyone I can find . Went over and looked at a matinee dance . How presumably civilized people can so contort themselves , so indulge in lascivious embrace , and call it clean is beyond me . I think all dancing ought to be suppressed . September 30  --  Worked again as a clerk . Some of the girls here seem to fancy me but I ca n't believe it . Have n't decidedwhether to study or to run wild . Which ? It depends on her . October 1  --  Shall I write to her ? I do n't know . I 'm journeyinglike a leaf in a wind . October 3  --  Well , got a letter from her . I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should have written her that long ago . This is the letter he received from Neloa : Dear Boy , I do n't know why you have n't written . I guess you do n't care any more and I should worry . We have some snow here today and the weather is very cold . I think my English teacher is a cross old hen . She makes me write themes and I hate themes . Well , I will ring off for this time . As ever , NELOA.  | And this is Vridar 's answer : Dear Girl , if you feel the way your letter suggests , you are wasting stamps . When I left you in Rigby you said I could put your love to any test I could think of ; and now , because you have n't received a letter , you write as if you do n't give a damn . Is that your idea of love ? Does it all mean to you no more than that ? If so , please address your letters to another name . VRIDAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's all right . But she will have to learn humility or to hell with her ... . Strong men , I imagine , never fall in love . Such nonsense is for simpletons like me . October 9  --  Well , her letters like Wilson 's Mexican negotiationsleave me no wiser . She evades . Am going to enlist or head for South America .... Last night a man here named Gudler said I tried to sneak into bed with his wife . It was Forenoon . The woman screamed and has been hysterical all day . . . And I think the fool ought to be slept with if she feels so insecure . There 's something funny about it . Is a really virtuous woman ever hysterical ? I 'll know some day . October 12  --  Letter from her : sweet , earnest . Will send her a ring now . . . . I have a rented typewriter and am in heaven . I want to write a novel but do n't think I know enough . October 21  --  No letter this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store . The playboy of Antelope : no care , no disillusionment . I 'd give the world if I could be a reckless spender and a gay dog . October 22  --  Well , the joke is on me . The playboy sits at home and it begins to seem to him that he 's a worm and womankind is a robin . The girl ditched me . I 'll be a scholar and some lovely thing in fiction will be my wife . Elizabeth Bennett . Portia . The Wife of Bath ! P209October 31  --  Letter from Diana says Neloa is flirting with other men . My God ! ' November 1  --  Why am I taking dancing ? 1 ) To acquire self-poise ; 2 ) to learn more about women ; 3 ) for social intercourse ; 4 ) for manners . I think the last two are piddle . Nor do I understand why any man should want to learn about women . . . . But on with the one-step ! November 9  --  Wilson won . Thank God , for I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Talked today with a Miss Graves , author , feminist , educator . Asked if she thought it possible to combine the emotional and academic . Said she did . Fine . That 's what I want . November 11  --  Am learning the Canter Hesitation Waltz , the most side-splitting assortment of advance and retreat and St. Vitus ever devised to work up a person 's lusts . Most people do n't know why they dance . I 'm convinced of that . And a lot do n't know why they marry ! I did n't know a few months back . December 1  --  Diana says Neloa is also writing to several men . I was so God-damned mad I went for a long walk and then sat down and wrote her  --  as if I had not already written her the same thing a hundred times ! This is what Vridar wrote : Dear Neloa : When I left you in September , you said I could trust you henceforth in all things . We were to have no secrets , tell no lies . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to other men . Are deceit and lying a hopeless part of you ? Will you never be honest or have any wish to be ? I expect an answer at once and no damned fooling about it , for I 'm awfully sick of being a fool and loving where loving is silly . I fancy , though , there may be cures for love . If you do n't want to write , send the ring and I 'll know we 're through . VRIDAR .   And to this letter Neloa answered : Dear Vridar , you seem willing to believe your sister instead of me . I 'm not flirting with anyone . It 's true I 've answered some letters from old friends . They 're just friendly letters and I did n't bother you about them . You can see them if you want to . It 's all for you to decide . If you say to send the ring , I will , and the poem you sent with it . You say you ca n't love a liar . Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . NELOA . Vridar read this letter and was furious . But he did not send for the ring ; he did not write . In agony of doubt again , he walked a long while , trying to see his way out . And he was still in doubt , still enraged and tortured , when two unexpected events entered his life . They plotted his life for him and he followed where they led .   THE FIRST of these was the dastardly way in which he changed lodgings . McClintock was a sly and undisciplined youth who thieved and whored with equal relish and who had a most unscrupulous sense of fun . For Vridar only of all the persons around him did he have either affection or loyalty , and for many weeks he had been trying to persuade him and Mertyl to share rooms with him elsewhere . He was sick of his cold dark room in the attic . He despised the avarice of his landlord . And one afternoon he told Vridar he had found two rooms that were wellfurnishedand well-heated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forenoon but he knew it would be unwise to live with him . And there was Mertyl , still a very pious lad who voiced sharp disapproval of Forenoon 's ways . " He 's no good , " Mertyl said . " He 's headed for the dogs . " Nevertheless , after deliberating for hours , and in spite of his best judgment , Vridar told McClintock to engage a truck . " We 'll leave in the night , " Forenoon said . " I owe month 's rent . We got a-sneak out . " Vridar considered this . He owed no rent because he stoked a furnace for his underground den . And he went to Professor Yupp and said he was leaving , but he said nothing of McClintock 's going , for this , it seemed to him , was none of his business . Then he and Mertyl packed their things and waited for the truck . It was to come at midnight .   An hour before midnight Forenoon came stealthily down with his bags and whispered that Yupp was asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while the three young men waited here . And then Forenoon , with the pretext of going to a lavatory , sneaked back into the house and did a most malicious thing . After a few minutes he returned and he began to laugh , unable to restrain his glee . He clapped hands to his mouth and sputtered and choked ; he reeled down the sidewalk , bellowing like mad . And Vridar , watching him , became suspicious ; but he affected a most obtuse unconcern . He laid his plans and confidedin Mertyl , and Mertyl decoyed Forenoon to the corner drugstore . Then Vridar dashed to his room and what he found there amazed him . McClintock had utterly demolished the chair and the table , the dishes and the light . All these were scattered in ruins . And he had jumped on the iron bed and distorted it into rainbows ; he had kicked holes in the springs ; and with the aid of a knife , he had made of the mattress a pile of cotton and rag . He had jerked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddled the window shade , and he had smashed the box-cupboard from the wall . The room looked as if it had been struck by a cyclone . Filled with wonder and rage , Vridar stared at all these broken things ; and then , with only vengeance in his mind , he went quietly up the stairway and entered McClintock 's room . Working swiftly , and yet as softly as he could , he destroyed all the dishes and stabbed all the pots . The rickety chair and table he knocked apart and the more fragile pieces he brokeP213across his knee . By jumping on the bed , or by wrenching its frame with his hands , he made it look as scarred and twisted as if it had come through a fire . He demolished the shade and curtain , and with a knife , he riddled the ugly faded paper on the walls . Pausing then to see what else he could do , he saw the shabby linoleum and this he tore into shreds . Then he went down the stairway and to the sidewalk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments they came up the street . Forenoongiggled and then burst into devilish joy , and Vridar stared at him as if amazed . Forenoon walked round and round Vridar , looking at him with bright malicious eyes , howling with glee . " Shut up , " Vridar said . Forenoon sobered a little . But his joy exploded in sudden snorts and he went to the corner and out of sight and there he howled again . Vridar looked at Mertyl and winked . " He broke everything in our room . I slipped up and returned the favor . " The truck now came and the baggage was loaded . They rode to Second East and unloaded their stuff and entered their new home . The two rooms were small and shabby but they were clean . The man who owned them was a Jew and had a grocery out front , and Forenoon said he would steal all their food from this store . Then he strode about like a showman , leadingVridar to the bath , a small ugly place on a hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . He stooped to unlace his shoes and fell to the floor , roaring like a demon , his hands threshing the air . Vridar began to laugh , too , and in a few moments his roaring disputed with McClintock 's and shook the room . Someone knocked on the door . " Come in ! " Forenoon cried . A Jew in pajamas thrust his head around . " What 's all the racket for ? " " Beat it ! " Forenoon said . " I ca n't have any noise after ten o'clock . It 's past midnight . " " Take your mug away , " said Forenoon , " or I 'll throw a shoe at it . " The face vanished and the door was closed . In a few minutes there was another rap and the Jew entered with a policeman . " What 's the trouble here ? " asked the policeman . " Nothing much , " said Vridar . " We were laughingand he told us to be still . " The policeman glared around him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll run you in . " Forenoon was looking rather sheepish now . After the two men were gone he told of what he would do . He would steal the Jew blind and seduce his daughter ; and if he did n't like that , he would knock his chin into his cerebellum . Then he undressed and crawled into bed , chuckling all the while ; and during the night from time to time he awoke and guffawed , and Vridar , awakened , howled with him . And when morning came , Forenoon was bursting with the secret . " You must be a fool , " he said , grinning at Vridar . " Are all the people in Antelope simple as you ? " " People in Antelope know more than they tell . " " Listen , you know what I been howlun about ? " " Of course I know . "   " Like hell . You 'll blow a slat out when I tell you . " " You 're the one who 'll blow a slat out . " McClintock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Listen , Forenoon , fools are grown down in Cedar City where you came from . My room looked pretty bad , did n't it ? Well , it looked like a palace in comparison with yours . " " You mean you went up and busted my room ! " " Busted it ! I did n't leave anything as big as your t humb . " Forenoon scowled . He came over to Vridar , his gestures menacing , and Vridar faced him , his hands clenched . " I would n't start anything , " Vridar said . " That was a dirty trick ! " " Sure it was . But you started it . " Forenoon turned away and sat down . In a few moments he was roaring again . What , he asked , would Yupp do . He would have a convulsion and bite himself . And Forenoon lay on the floor and howled until he was spent and white . Then he rose and said he was going out to the store . He wanted to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would steal a pound of butter or a can of jam . In a few moments he returned with a can of peas . " I could n't see any butter , " he said . They now had breakfast but Mertyl would eat none of the peas . Vridar ate of them and said they were damned good . He was beginning to feel like a scoundrel , and he was a bit alarmed but he was also pleased . The Jew 's daughter , Forenoon said , was a swell thing to look at . He would have her in bed in a week . " Get me one , too , " Vridar said , and wondered if he meant it . " Sure . You know Peg Winters ? You'n have her . " " All right . Fetch her around . " They walked to the campus and on their way they came face to face with Professor Yupp . He stopped and looked at them . His small eyes were full of pain , his mouth twitched . Never had he known , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never would he have believed it . And he asked : " What would your parents say ? " " I do n't have none , " Forenoon said . " When they saw me they gave up . " Yupp looked at him and then at Vridar . His eyes filled with tears and Vridar felt horribly ashamed . He stared at the earth and did not speak . " It would have been bad enough , " Yupp went on , " out of common street hoodlums . But that college students  --  I can hardly believe it yet . " He turned down the walk and Vridar and Mertyl and Forenoon went to the campus . To hell with the old skinflint , Forenoon said . " He froze me to death all last year . I wish I 'd kicked his house down . " But Vridar , though he despised Yupp 's greed , felt only shame for what he had done . He slipped away after a while and went to Yupp 's home . He knocked on the door and Yupp came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vridar said . " What I did was cowardly and I know it . But McClintock slipped in and smashed my room and I was furious and I smashed his . I am very sorry . I want to apologize and to pay for what I broke . " P217Yupp looked at him for quite a while . All right , " he said . " I 'll send you a statement of the cost . " And very coldly he bowed to Vridar and closed the door . For this mean escapade , Vridar never forgave himself . He always looked back upon it with shame . The other event reached farther into his life . It led him to a most perilous and foolhardy undertaking and could easily have brought him to disaster . It started in the grocery where he was a Saturday clerk . Some of the clerks who had been here a long while were thieves and Vridar knew they were thieves . His suspicions had been aroused by small and casual doings , and he had watched them , and he had learned what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and this man slipped small and costly articles into his pockets when he went to lunch and again when he left at night . Another was a large sour woman named Maggie Simms . Her relatives and friends would come in and buy bulky articles and into the bags Maggie slyly put many things that were never paid for . Three other women also thieved in this way but they were all trusted clerks . And Vridar wondered why the manager of this department was so stupid and why he did not see what was so clearly to be seen . On a Saturday late in November Vridar 's sales broke a record . This record , which had stood for four years , was held by Maggie , and now she openly detestedhim . He saw her talking about him to other clerks and then to the manager ; and the manager came to him , after a while , and drew him aside . He wanted to know how things were going and Vridar said they were going all right . May I see your book ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He returned it to him and went over to the cashier and talked with her for a long time . And during this evening , Vridar knew that he was being closely watched . He resented this spying but his record was clean and he had nothing to fear . On the next Saturday he was watched again . From time to time the manager would go to the cashier 's window and study the sales-slips there . The cashier was a lovely girl and Vridar liked her and thought she liked him . When next he gave her money he lingered by her window and spoke . " Why am I being watched ? " he asked in a low voice . " I would n't stand there , " she said . He looked at her gratefully and moved away . Thereafter she watched him , too , but only with sympathy , he supposed . Just before closing time the manager came to him . He was cool and officious . Mr. Drake , he said , wanted to see Vridar in his office . Archibald Drake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vridar said ; and he went at once to Drake 's office . " Sit down , " said Drake . " You want to see me ? " Vridar asked . " Yes . " For several moments Drake studied him . " You need n't come next Saturday . We do n't need you . " " Do n't need me ! You mean  --  I 'm fired ? "   " I mean we 'll not need you any more . " " But why ? " " I do not care to discuss the matter . You may go now . Vridar stood up . He felt insulted and he was furious . When he spoke again his voice shook . " I 'm being dismissed . I 've a right to know why . Has n't my work been all right ? " For several long moments Drake stared at him . His eyes were searching and without pity . " I do not care to discuss the matter . You may go . " I wo n't ! If you do n't tell me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you insist . We have reason to believe that you are dishonest . Is that clear enough ? " " That I 'm  --  I 'm dishonest ! Who told you that ? " " I have no more to say . " The man now took a paper and began to read . Vridar looked.at the paper and shook . " I have n't been ! " he cried , speaking to the face behind the paper . " I swear to God ! " There was no answer . The paper was turned and the man read on another page . " You do have clerks who are cheats ! " Vridar went on furiously . " Why do n't you fire them ! " The paper fell and the man looked at him . " Will you go now ? " he asked quietly . " Yes ! But first listen to this : anyone who says I cheated is a liar , a dirty lowdown liar ! And that goes for all of you ! " Then Vridar swung and left the room . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down the stairs . He went to the cloakroom , his mind busy with vengeance ; and while he stood here , taking off his apron and jacket , his glance fell on a stack of sales-books . Without knowing why , he thrust one of these books into an inside pocket . Then he put on his cap and climbed the stairs and found the street . He went home convulsed with rage and trying to plot vengeance for this insult . Entering his rooms , he sat on a bed and tried to think . How could he avenge himself ! How could he outwit this wealthy snob who had called him a thief and whose only evidencehad been spiteful gossip ! . . . During his life , it was true , he had stolen a few things ; but what lad had not ? He had filched candy and cigars , he had staggeredhome under a case of beer , but only because others had done so . He had stolen in bravado then . And now , after having been honest . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still pacing when Forenoon and Mertyl came . Roaring in anger and self-pity , he told them what had been done . " I 'll get even ! I 'll outwit that insolent snob ! I 'll do it if it costs me my life ! " Forenoon liked this outburst . A petty thief himself , who laid hands on what he could take , he had urged Vridar to steal with him , suggesting that they might become Robin Hoods . And besides this , he could now smell a profit . " Make him feed us , " McClintock said . That would be a swell vengeance . " Vridar had n't thought of that . He seized the idea and pondered it . One plan and another stood like dark silhouettes in his mind , and each he examined , probing to the possibilities and the dangers . And at last he said :   " He 'll feed us . I 've decided that . " He walked the streets for hours and he evolved a plan that was as cunning as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his insult with groceries . " He called me a thief . All right , I 'll be a thief . " " What  --  whu-whu-whu-what 's the plan ? " asked McClintock , so excited that he stuttered . But Vridar would not explain . For two days he deliberated , weighing risks , searching the unforeseen : exulting as he wrought his pattern of details . " Realize , " he said to McClintock , " we run a big risk . If we get caught , it 's ten years for us . . . . That 's all right for you . You do n't have any parents . " " Thank God . They 're a big nuisance . " " If you lose your head " Lose my head ! Who the Christ you talkun to ? " " You blunder things . When you swipe a can of peas , you shake around for an hour . . . . And if you blunder things , I 'll blow your head off . " " Here ! You tryun to bluff me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guts , say so . " And very carefully , step by step , Vridar outlinedthe plan . Then he stared at McClintock for a longmoment . " You , " he said , " will get the oranges . You 'll fetch me the sales-slip . I 'll write the order and you 'll get it and the oranges into the box . . . . Is that much clear ? " Forenoon shivered . He looked at Vridar and grinned . " But how 'll I get it in the box ? " " I told you , damn it ! Cut a hole in one overcoat pocket . Reach your finger through the hole and carry the oranges under your coat . You 'll be standing by the box and someone will push you and you 'll drop the oranges " Who 'll push me ? " McClintock was trembling now . " And what if I get caught ? " " Keep a cool head . " Is that all I have to do ? " " That 's all . I 'll take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is get that package into the box . " " My God , that 's enough ! " Vridar looked at him pityingly . McClintock was a thief but he had the courage only of a petty slinking thief and sometimes he had n't that . McClintock rose , shaking in all his limbs , and went outside . Vridar turned to Mertyl . " You do n't have to be in on this . " " You 'll be caught , " Mertyl said . " Not if Forenoon does his part . " " I would n't try it , " Mertyl said . " Oh , the hell you would n't ! You think that sonof-a-bitchcan call me a thief and get away with it ? ... And what do I care about life or jail or death ? They 're all the same to me now . " " What would mater think ? " " She wo n't know . I 've got the nerve , so do n't fret . Everything will be all right . " McClintock came in and stared at Vridar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wo n't do it unless you do it first . " " You coward . " " Coward , hell ! It 's fishy , I tell you ! " " Will you do it if I show you how ? " " Sure  --  if it works . " " All right , " Vridar said , " I 'll show you how . "   DURING this night Vridar tossed in dream , his mind reaching for the crafty stratagem ; and on the next morning , after pondering the matter again , he knew he would have to be a forger also . This thought terrified him a little but after a while he liked it and was not afraid at all . In the imitation of handwriting he possessed remarkable skill , having  --  pent , during his high school years , many hours over the signatures of poets . He had copied their names because he envied them and wanted to be like them and because in their handwriting he read their character . And besides all this , he little cared now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sky of storm and he felt the lightning and the death and was unafraid . " Forgery , too ! " Forenoon cried . Yes . " " You ca n't do it ! " " I can . " And Vridar copied Forenoon 's signature until that young man , bewildered and amazed , could n't tell the one from the other . In great excitement he went to the store and got a bag of oranges and Vridar sat by a window and studied the sales-slip . It was a woman 's writing , small and precise , and it would be difficult to copy . " Why the hell , " he asked , " did n't you get a man clerk ? " " God , I never thought about that . " " Damn it , I 'm no wizard . Go back and get a man clerk . "   And while Forenoon was gone , Vridar went to a drugstore and called the grocery . He asked the price of one thing and another and he wrote them down with painstaking care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip and for a long while he copied the writing ; and Forenoon stood by , protesting , advising , and ready to flee . " Here ! " he yelled . " I do n't want my name on the damn thing ! " " Shut up . " Forenoon looked at the order . " That 's a hell of a bunch of food to go to jail for . Get some fancy stuff . " " No . We 're playing safe . " McClintock said the order looked fishy . He held it to light and turned it over and over . " It wo n't work , " he said . " My God , I tell you it 's fishy ! " Vridar took the order and looked at it . He was trembling a little . The crucial moment had come . " I 'll take it , " he said . " Get yourself ready for jail . " " I 'm going to beat it , " McClintock said . " Good God , I tell you it 's fishy ! Mert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the order . " I would n't try it , " he said to Vridar . " Bosh ! " Vridar cried . " What do I care about jails ! " In a pocket of McClintock 's overcoat he cut a hole and then put the coat on and reached down through the hole with a finger and thumb and grasped the bag . He felt a little unnerved but when he looked at McClintock 's white face he shrugged .   " A hell of a crook you are ! " he said . He entered the store and could barely move through the crowd . He was shoved about and in a little while came to the box , and by the box he stood tiptoe , as if looking for someone ; and a moment later , when a woman pushed against him , he pretended to lose his balance and almost fall , and in this moment he dropped the bag of oranges into the box . He scowled at the woman as if annoyed and he moved away , still gazing about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . He wanted to run now . But he stood on the corner and looked at faces around him . He moved slowly down the street . When he heard a bird sing , he stopped to listen , as if in no hurry at all . Back in his room , he affected to be at ease but a tremendous excitement shook him . McClintock dropped to a chair and mopped his brow . " We 're goners ! " McClintock said . He stared at Vridar . His face was like chalk . " Good God , let 's beat it ! What you want a-sit around here for ? " Vridar crossed the room to get a drink . He looked at his hands and saw that they trembled . He shrugged . " For Christ sake ! " McClintock howled . " Let 's go ! Are you crazy ? In an hour we 'll all be in jail ! " " That 's all right , " Vridar said . " A lot of good men are in jails . " McClintock mopped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his small greedy eyes were bright with terror . At every unexpected noise he leapt up as if kicked . He went to a window and peered out or he stood by the door and listened . He lowered his voice to a whisper  | " We 're goners ! We 're goners sure as Christ ! " Vridar took a book and tried to read or from time to time he looked at McClintock . Forenoon 's cowardiceamazed him . " Stop your damned fussing ! " he cried . " Get hold of yourself . " " I 'm going ! " McClintock said . Feverishly he began to pack his things . He jerked a bag open and was piling clothes into it when a knock sounded on the door . For a long moment no one spoke . McClintock rose to his feet and looked at Vridar and shook . And then , in a last desperate effort to escape , he vanished under a bed . " Come in ! " Vridar called . The door was opened and a man entered carrying a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor , " Vridar said quietly . He went over and looked into the box . He checked the groceries against the bill and said everything was all right . The man went out with the box and Vridar went over and shut the door . From under the bed , McClintock thrust a white face . " Is he gone ? " Vridar burned the sales-slip and destroyed the ashes . McClintock came out and looked at the stuff on the floor . He lifted one article and another , his eyes shining with greedy interest . " We just as well a-had a lot more stuff , " he said . From December until early spring Vridar maneuveredwith care and cunning and his groceries cost him only a few cents in each week . To the constantp227urgings of McClintock he yielded , little by little , until at last he ordered only the best of everything : the choicest fruits and pickles and jams , shrimp and boneless chicken , imported cheese , nuts and stuffed olives , and the finest of sifted peas . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We need a swell joint . " And now , as formerly , he urged Vridar to larger orders , so that they would have stuff to sell . They could buy it in case lots and sell it at a discount . " As a fool , " Vridar said , " you have n't any competitors . " " You call me a fool ! " McClintock roared . " Listen , I 'll lay your eyes right out on your cheeks ! " " I can imagine that . " " I 'll beat your daylights out one these-here days . You realize that ? " " Go ahead . " Vridar looked at McClintock 's muscular frame . I le was a powerful young man and he was quick ; but twice before Vridar had called his bluff and McClintockhad swaggered and cursed and gone out like a match . And now he said : " Well , let 's eat . I 'm hungry as a dog . " And during these weeks , Mertyl protested again and again . " Not that I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go , I 'll go with you . But it is n't right . " " Right , hell ! " Vridar cried . " Organized society is organized theft . Some steal openly ; some exploit the humble and the weak ; and others filch in the name of charity and God . One thief gets punished and another gets his name written on a bronze tablet . ... What the hell do you mean by right ! " " Just the same , " Mertyl retorted impatiently , you do n't have to steal because others do . Besides , all thieves get caught . " " Yes ? If they did , the only persons out of jails would be dead ones . " " And there 's dad and mater , " Mertyl went on . " What would they think ? " " I 've thought of that , " Vridar said ; and he said no more . He thought of it often . He blustered and cursed ; he said he was sick of the world , of humanity , of life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of cotton on the end of a string . And then he would remember his parents , their devotion and trust , and he would feel sick and lost . He would walk to the mountains and climb them and look northward and his eyes would fill with tears ; and he would return to his room , wishing he could die . " Little I care , " he said to Mertyl , " what happens to me " ; and in this he was sincere . But he cared what happened to his parents ; and week after week he fought the bitter fight , drawn in one hour to desperate plotting , to vengeance and hatred , to the ways of the outcast ; and drawn in the next to a sense of the beautiful and the good ... . And on a day in April , the second of these forces conquered and he announced that he would thieve no more . He was sick of it , he said . He sat on a chair and hid his face in his hands . And McClintock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write onep229more order ; threatened him with ruin if he did not . The threat stirred Vridar to fury . " You 'll do what ? " he asked , rising to his feet . " Listen , McClintock , do you want to be killed as dead as a doorknob ? I 'm through with stealing . You understand me ? And take a tip from me and keep your God-damned mouth shut ! " " Yeah ? You 're going to heaven , I guess . You 're going to wear wings . " " Just remember , that 's all . I 've been a thief . All right . Just open that mug of yours and I 'll be a murderer , too . " He advanced , his hands clenched , and McClintock stepped back . " It would be a public service to kill a man like you . McClintock , " he went on , grinning , " you understand me ? You understand 1 'd as soon bump you off as look at you ? " Forenoon stared at him for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Vridar thieved no more . But this was in April ; and before April came , he had been guilty of another theft and he had been busy with other kinds of devilment . The story now reverts to a record of these . P230McCLINTOCK was a malicious and destructive person . Emotionally immature , undisciplined and unmoral , and with fierce resentment against his humble origins , he vented his spite in nihilism . His glee in smashing furniture or in enraging landlords was fiendish ; and he seemed never so happy as when pursued by one whom he had outwitted . Before a week had passed here , he had broken all the lights and demolished the mirror in the bathroom and twisted keys off in several doors along the hallway . And when he could find nothing to destroy , he tricked Vridar . One day he locked Vridar in the bathroom and left him there , impotent and furious , for hours ; and a week later , when the rascal was asleep on his belly , Vridar bound McClintock 's hands behind him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the bed cursing and made such a racket that the Jew came and told them to get out . They went to a hotel and engaged a large cornerroom . Now , McClintock said , a maid would cleantheir room ; and that , he declared , winking lewdlyat Mertyl , was not all she would do . And at once heprowled through the building , looking for the maids . But they were in this hotel only eight days . Undertheir corner was a drugstore , and the druggist hadpiled upon a long glass case an enormous assortment of lotions and perfumes . . . . McClintock liked thisdrugstore . While buying a pencil or a package ofgum , he would steal dyes and laxative tablets andP231garden seed , and a lot of other things for which he had no use . On one day he stole a gross of paper napkins and on the next he came guiltily in with a syringe under his coat . Often in this winter , he and Vridar wrestled , sometimes in the school 's gymnasium , sometimes in their room . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClintock had stolen . And nearly always in these bouts , Vridar triumphed , often drawingblood from his opponent ; and Forenoon became spiteful or insolent . He taunted Vridar about women and about his Antelope heritage . " Are you a maphrodyte ? " he asked one day . Vridartried to ignore him but Forenoon would not be ignored . " Do n't you ever dream about women ? .. . Hey , are you a capon ? or do n't you know what a capon is ? " Vridar did not . He wondered about it and read a book . " Vreed , you ever kissed a girl yet ? . . . Honest to God , have you ? " " Sure I have . " " She must a-been a homely bitch . She must alivedon Antelope . " He stared at Vridar and added : " You know how many girls I 've slept with ? I got a record every one . I intend to publish it some day . " 1 le rummaged among his things and found the record . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Smith . Sounds like a fake name but there 's lots of Mary Smiths in the world . This was a relative of the great and original Joseph . . . . Now listen . I spent three dollars and ten cents on Mary . . . . God damn ! She ai n't the first one . . . . Here , I 'll tell about the first one . " P232Vridar turned pages of a book and pretended to read but he was all ears . " The first was Susan Dalton . . . . That was when I was fourteen . She was fourteen . I did n't spend no money on her and it 's been so long I 've forgot what she looked like . . . . Well , the next was Kate Olson . I was sixteen and Kate cost me only a dollar . I took her to two shows and bought her one ice-cream cone . ... And I do n't remember what she looked like , either . .. Say , when I publish this book , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . " Well , the next is Mabel Turner . A fat blond . I did it to Mabel on her back porch and once was enough . God , she was sure fat ! . . . The next was Ophelia Summers . That was here in Salt Lake . She cost me four dollars and sixty cents . It says here I bought her some sweet peas and two boxes cherry-covered chocolates . I got them on sale . . . . Well , the next was Janice Hunter . Vreed , you got any relatives here ? I 'll bet Janice was your cousin or something . . . . Vreed , you got a sister ? ... Hey , you capon , you got a sister ? " " Go to hell . " " Tell me : you got a sister ? " " Yes . Now shut up . " " Wish she was here . Bet I could do it to her in a week . " Vridar laid his book aside . He looked at McClintock . " Leave my sister out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sleep with your mother . " Vridar stood up , feeling hot . " Listen , Forenoon , talk all you damn please aboutP233women but leave my mother and sister out of it . You understand ? " " Say , big boy , draw in your horns . Draw in your horns ! I 'd even seduce that girl from the sticks . What was her name ? . . . Neloa something . I 'm sailingup some day to give her the works . " With a yell of fury , Vridar leapt to McClintock 's throat and they struggled and rolled to the floor . They fought like tigers and the room shook . They were on their feet and went reeling to a bed , with Vridar seeking Forenoon 's throat and with Forenoon fighting desperately to escape from the mad hands . Then Vridar whipped under McClintock and pitched him over his head and the two of them came down like bags of sand . There was a terrific crash in the drugstore below . Sobered at once , they dived into a closet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knock sounded and Vridar heard two men come in . They walked about the room and talked excitedly , and McClintock , meanwhile , doubled over , with hands clapped to his mouth , trying to restrain his glee . The two men left and Vridar and McClintock came out ; and an hour later they went down to the drugstore . It looked as if a bull had been loose there . Broken glass was scattered over the floor and counters , and into the street poured the heavy sick fragrance of lotions . Two men and a girl were still busy with brooms . In this evening , the hotel-keeper presented them with a bill for a hundred and seventeen dollars and twenty cents . They would have to pay it , he said , or suffer arrest.  | " All right , " McClintock said , and took the bill . As soon as the man had gone , he touched a match to it . " It 's move again , " he said . " I 'll get a sleigh and find some rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a back stairway , leaving no clues behindthem , and hauled it to rooms on Seventh East Street ... . " The only thing I hate , " Forenoon said , " is leavingthat girl . I had her dizzy . You notice how she smiled at me when she cleaned our room ? " For six weeks they lived on the second floor of an old house . Their landlady was a tall bleak spinster who never smiled . But she was patient and for a long while they played the devil here without drawing from her more than a soft rebuke . Once they wrestled and shook the ceiling below , and she climbed the stairs and rapped and said gently they would have to stop . Two pieces , she said , had fallen from her chandelier . And once when Vridar shoved McClintockthrough a window and that astonished young man crashed to a porch roof and then bounded off , demolishing some lattice-work , Vridar was reproved so politely that he went at once and repaired all the damage . But they became steadily more violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devilmentreached a crisis . There was talk of war and there was talk of prohibitingalcoholic drinks , and this gossip , particularly of the latter , aroused Vridar 's interest . He had never drunk anything but beer . But he knew the fragrant smell of whiskey , having sniffed , in time of childhood ,  |p235some  of Charley Bridwell 's empty bottles . And when he read in a local paper a dull sermon against alcohol , declaring that it caused all catastrophes , from idiocy to pauperism , he resolved to taste the stuff . It would be a pity to die and not know what whiskey was like . " Let 's get a bottle , " he said . " Get it , " Forenoon said . " I 'll pay half . " Vridar entered a saloon and was spellbound . He saw thousands of bottles , each with its own lovely color , its regal stamps and seal . This room was a deep and beautiful wonder on the edge of life . It was a glorious eddy on the wide dark stream , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never having come here before . " What you want ? " a man asked . " I do n't know . Just let me look a while . " He gazed at bottles and breathed the smell of beer and watched men come in and drink . Foam was like milk-froth on their beards . One man drew hair into his mouth and licked the foam off ; and they all drank with such relish , and seemed released to such good fellowship , that Vridar made a resolve : if he ever found himself in Europe , he would drink of everything he could find . With a quart of Bourbon he went home . When a little way up the street he tore a part of the wrappingfrom the bottle and read the label again . And he carried it softly as if it were a babe in his arms . " What you get ? " asked McClintock . " Bourbon , " Vridar said , speaking as if he knew all about whiskies . They opened the bottle and smelled of its contents . Vridar breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they began to drink . They offeredthe bottle to Mertyl but he spurned it and went outside . In a little while he returned . An hour later both Vridar and Forenoon were drunk . Vridar did not know he was drunk . He knew only that he was besieged by all sorts of weird and ridiculous impulses . He wanted to laugh and then he wanted to cry . He wanted to write to Neloa and he thought of her with a vast and hungry tenderness ; but in the next moment he wanted to fight or sing or stand on his head and grimace . And it was very strange , he reflected , that he should be in such a predicamentas this : feeling by turns so elated or so wretched ; now lusting for battle , now overcome by an enormous love for humankind . The room danced and Mertyl sat in a blur and Forenoon moved about like a phantom . The whiskey shot through and through him like an ecstasy of flame . His thoughts came and went in flashes of chaos or in tenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut away the light . He wanted to fly , to enter some soft voluptuous eternity , and to move round and round there in the loveliness of a waltz . He stood up and the whole world spun in darkness and seemed to be a faint and melodious song . He sat again and shook his head and strove to see . After a while he smote himself and kicked out , trying to clear his senses ; and he began to talk . " What 's matter with me ? " he asked . He giggledand broke into a high shrill laugh . This astonishedhim and for a time he was silent . " Say , I feel queer ! " " You look queer , " someone said . It was Forenoonspeaking but he could not see Forenoon . . . . Yes , hep237could see Forenoon . He was over by a window and he was doing something there . " What you up to ? .. . Hey , McClintock , you fool . You awful fool ! " " Fool yourself . Big dumb fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , answer me . " " Shut up . " Hanging to the eve were enormous icicles and Forenoon leaned out and grasped one , a tapering cylinderof ice weighing a hundred pounds . He broke it off and dragged it inside . He clutched it in his arms as he would a bag of grain and staggered round the room with it . " What 'll I do with this ? " he said . He went in circles round and round the room . Mertyl rose and supported him and Mertyl told him to throw the ice out but Forenoon said he wanted to do something with it . Water from the ice now ran down him and filled his clothes . " What 'll I do with this ! " he howled . " Kill yourself with it , " Vridar said . He liked this notion . He rose and staggered about with McClintock ; and again he said : " Kill yourself with it . " Forenoon stumbled across the room and entered the hallway . For a moment he stood by the baluster and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of ice to the floor below . It fell with the sound of crashing glass . Forenoon giggled with glee and Vridar went out and they both giggled and looked down at the pile of ice . The landlady carne out . She gasped with amazement and stared up at them and Vridar thought her face looked very silly . " What does this mean ? " she asked  | Forenoon leaned to Vridar 's shoulder and choked with happiness , and Vridar , pushed off balance , nearly went headlong after the ice . The woman came up the stairs . She faced them and Vridar could tell that she was very angry but he did not care . " Who done that ? " asked the woman . " He did ! " Forenoon said ; and he shoved Vridar and Vridar sprawled in a heap . When he looked up , the woman was gazing down at him . " I did n't , " he said . " He did . That fool did . " " Why ai n't you a young girl ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll bet you was some ladybug once . " " You clean that mess up ! " the woman cried . " I 'd be ashamed ! I 'd go off and hide your faces ! " " A face like mine ? " " Yes , " said Vridar , still piled up by the wall , " a face like yours . Hide your face , McClintock . For shame ! Where 's your manners , you lubber ? . . . Shame-shame , double-shame The woman was growing hysterical . " You clean that up ! " she wailed . " I 'll have you arrested ! " " He 'll clean it up , " Vridar assured her . He felt very happy and bold . He grinned happily at the woman . " He 's a gentleman , he 'll clean it up . McClintock , clean that mess up ! McClintock ! " " Go to hell ! I 'm going to puke . " He leaned over the railing and the woman seized him and dragged him back . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my house ! " " Let me be ! " McClintock said.  | " You let him be , " Vridar said . " He 's my friend . ... Miss What's-your-name , you let him alone . " " God , I 'm sick ! " Forenoon groaned . " I 'm sick as a dog . " " He 's sick , " said Vridar . " He 's sick as a dog ... . Well , go on and die , you dog . You dirty nasty drunken dog , you ! . . . McClintock ! " " What you want ? " " Go on and die . A nice disgrace you are . Droppingice in nice ladies ' houses . You ought to die , McClintock . " The landlady had entered their room and was talking with Mertyl . Forenoon doubled over and groaned . He was dying , he said . In a minute he would vomit all over the city . He would blow whiskeyclear to the Mormon temple . Vridar came over on hands and knees . " Get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Forenoon 's legs . " Hey , for God sake , do n't puke here ! Down there , see the bathroom . . . . Forenoon , ca n't you see ? " Vridar drew himself up and put an arm round Forenoon and tried to lead him away . He broke Forenoon'sclutch on the railing and then they both reeled and pitched headlong . The woman came out like a hornet . She was crying wildly and threatening arrest and police and disgrace and all these threats came with vague gentle insistence into Vridar 's mind . He rose to his hands and knees and looked up at her . " I 'll clean it , " he assured her . " Please do n't talk that way . We 're gentlemen . We 're gentlemen and we 'll clean it up . " He moved on all fours to the head of the stairway.  | He strove to go down the stairs on hands and knees but his arms folded under him and he rolled and fetched up at the bottom with a yell and a crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting enemies . Then he looked up and he saw , as if far away , the face of the woman and the face of Mertyl . " I 'll clean it up , " he said . " Just give me time . " Moving about like an animal with four legs , he got a chunk of ice and crawled over to the door . " See , " he said , " I 'm cleaning it up . I 'm a gentleman and I 'll clean it up . " And while laboring , still on hands and knees , he poured a stream of assurances and declarationsat the floor above . " You look down here and you 'll see I 'm cleaning it up . Watch me . I always do what I say . . . . I 'm a gentleman . I drank some whiskey , that 's what 's wrong with me .... I never did before . . . . Well , I 'll pay all the damage . You just give me a bill and I 'll pay all the damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do that . I 'll cut your wood or milk your cow . I 'll do anything . Ask my brother if I wo n't do anything . Mert ! Hey , Mert ! You tell her I 'm a gentleman . Tell her I 'm all right . Tell her I just got  --  well . " He sat on the floor and looked up , trying to see the woman . He saw a face but he could not tell whether it was her face or Mertyl 's . Laying an arm across his breast and then gathering ice and banking it against him along the arm , he spoke to the face . " Up there , you listening ? . . . Well , I got my heart busted , that 's all . That , " he said , glancing up , " is what 's wrong with me . I loved a girl . She lied to me and I do n't care much now . Send me to jail , I do n't care . Shoot me , I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice out . He came back and piled other fragments against his arm . " Go on and have me arrested ! You think I care ? God damn , no . Do what you want to . I 'm headed for the dogs . A woman lied to me and I 'm headed for the dogs . Lots of men go to the dogs an account of women . Did you know that ? " He looked up through a fog . " Did you know that ? . . . Well , maybe you did n't . " He slid over and threw the armful to the porch . He came back and stacked the chips again . " You know what I intend to do ? Enlist and be shot . Go to war and be shot . Then I wo n't worry any more . I 'll get blown up . That 'll be the end of me .... Well , that 'll sure be the end of me . " He threw another armful out . When all the pieces were gathered , he took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch and wring his handkerchief dry and then return and soak it . Everything was so blurred that he could barely tell water from shadow . After the floor was wiped dry , he crawled up the stairway and into his room . The woman was sitting on his bed , weeping and blowing her nose . He sat on the floor and stared at her . " Do n't cry , " he said . " I cleaned it all up . I 'll pay all the damage . . . . You'n have me arrested if you want to . I do n't care . Put me in jail if that 'll make you happy . Just do what you like . " He looked at her with sober interest . He wondered why she wept now . And after a few minutes he wanted to comfort her . His eyes became full of mist and he felt a great tenderness and pity for everything . He loved the whole big sad world and this woman and McClintock and Neloa , and he felt borne down by loneliness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He drew himself to the bed and patted her arm . " Please do n't cry . Everything is all right now . "   AFTER the woman left the room , Vridar sat for a long while , feeling depressed and sick and McClintocklay on the bed and groaned . He said he was dying and Vridar said he hoped he died . Mertyl read a book and from time to time Vridar glanced at him . My brother , he thought , thinks I 've disgraced him . A woman deceived me and now I 'm drunk as a fool and I 'm sick as a fool , too . I 've disgraced my parents and myself and I 'm sick and the world would be better off if I were dead ... . McClintock rolled off to the floor and sat up . He looked at Vridar and whinnied with shrill glee . " So your heart 's busted , " he said . Now who done that to your poor little heart ? That Antelope hick ? " " Shut up , " Vridar said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied to you , did she ? My God , how my heart busts for you ! " " Shut up , I said ! " " You 're through with women now , I guess . You wo n't love nevermore . Oh , never , nevermore ! " He giggled and his giggles ran into hiccoughs . Loping over to the window , he leaned out as if to vomit ; he heaved and moaned and then came back and lay on the floor . " Once , " he said , " I puked right out of a window . I puked right on a swell guy . He had a cane . He humped straight up and yelled and long as I could see him he was humpun and yellun . . . . Well , so you 're going to the dogs . You 're through with girls , I guess . "   " Hell no , " said Vridar . " I 'm just starting . " " Let 's step some out tonight . " " It 's all right with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss like tannic acid . " " Any kind suits me . " " Let 's have some more drink . " " Sure , let 's stay drunk . " Mertyl looked at Vridar , his face obscurely cynical . Forenoon got the whiskey and drank and then Vridar drank . Vridar wiped his mouth and said he would die a drunkard . " Some of my mother 's people drank themselves to death . " He considered this . " A lot of poets did . James Thomson B. V. , he did . " " James Thomson , B. V. D. , " McClintock said and snickered . " Well , slick up . Comb your hair . Why do n't you ever comb your hair ? " Forenoon went to a closet and laid out two suits . He said Vridar could wear one of them , as well as a pair of his shoes and one of his hats . Then he got tonic and powder and rouge and told Vridar to put on some dog . " No wonder girls lie to you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the truth . " " Doll me up , " Vridar said . McClintock poured tonic on Vridar 's hair and then saturated the hair with perfumed oil . He combed the hair and it shone like polished metal . He got his razor and scraped the down off Vridar 's face and massaged his face with powders and scented water . With a pencil he darkened Vridar 's brows.  | " You look a little better , " he said . " You 're a homely bastard but mebbe you'n get a girl now . " " I'n get lots of girls . " " I mean good-lookun girls . The kind I get . " Vridar put on one of Forenoon 's suits and a pair of his shoes . He manicured his nails and rubbed on his hands something that smelled of heliotrope . He liked to smell of his hands now . Then he drew on a shirt and Forenoon adorned him with a gay tie , puttinginto it a knot two inches long . Long slender knots , he said , were the style now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're what the girls want . You got a-give a girl what she wants . " When he was fully dressed , Vridar strode about the room , appraising himself . He stared in a mirror at his polished and scented head . " You 're all right , " Forenoon declared . " One sniff of you and they 'll faint in your arms . " " Hope so , " Vridar said . " You better drink some more . You need some nerve .... And slick your shoes up . " In a cupboard on the hallway , Vridar found some stove polish and rubbed it on his shoes . They were blackened but they did not shine . He eyed them with misgivings and looked at McClintock . " That wo n't do ! " Forenoon cried . " No girl likes a guy if his shoes ai n't slick . " He got another pair and told Vridar to put them on . Vridar looked at the shoes and considered . All of McClintock 's shoes had been stolen : three pairs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I 'll wear mine , " he said .   " Good God , you ca n't get a girl with Sears Roebuckshoes on ! " McClintock poured shaving-lotion into a peanut butter jar and then filled the bottle with whiskey . He drank and Vridar drank and they entered the street . Forenoon began to sing and Vridar pitied him . Though no songster himself , he could feel his way through a simple melody ; and he reflected now , while staring with approval at his well-pressed trousers , that if there was to be any singing tonight , he would have to do it . He thought of one song and another and wondered which he would sing first . And while he walked westward , toward a sea of yellow sky , he hummed in his breath and fancied himself as a very stunning knight . " What kind a girl you want ? You like blonds ? " Any kind . " " What does this Antelope hick look like ? " " Shut up about her ! " Vridar yelled ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just never mind her ! " " Hey , stop shoving me around ! I 'll knock holes through you . I 'm a tough son-of-a-bitch when I 'm half-cocked . " " So am I ! " " Well , just do n't be so fresh with me . I 'll smack your ears off . " " Then shut up about her . " " To hell with her ! The sagebrush hick ! " " Shut up , I said ! " With a clenched hand Vridar pushed McClintock backward and squared off . McClintock'seyes shone with whiskey and spite . He ap/proached Vridar as if to strike ; and then stopped and looked at him ; and then grinned . " When I lick you , " he said , " it wo n't be over no Antelope chippy . " These words stung Vridar like a whip . He howled with rage and stripped his coat off . " You take that back ! " " Go to hell . And listen , if this is how you feel , go back and take my duds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stole them . " " You never stole nothing , I guess . Listen , we got a-be friends . I could send you to jail for life . You know that ? " " Try it ! " " We got a-be friends . We got a-be friends for life . " McClintock went into deep shadow and drank and Vridar went over and drank with him . " ' Well , " Forenoon asked , " are we friends or enemies ? " " Just as you like . " " We 're friends . Here , shake hands . " They clasped hands . " Now , " Forenoon said , " we 're friends . We 're two crooks and we 're friends . " They returned to the sidewalk . Vridar staggered a little and hoped he was drunk . He looked up at the sky and thought of the enormous dark world : of all its taverns and love-making , its carousals and feasts and brawls ; and of its men and women  --  how many thousands in this moment he could not imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lip and with their blood pouring like fire . And it seemed to him in this moment that life , and all the wonder of life , was only a carnival of dance and love , and that books were strange things hidden in closets , and that birth and death were two clowns in eternal joust . He hungered now , as he had hungered in Rigby , for dancing and a woman 's arms , a woman 's smell and touch and eyes ; and he remembered dances of which he had read  --  boutade and saraband , jig and schottischeand Highland fling , cakewalk and bolero , mazurkaand rigadoon and minuet  --  ; and the world seemed full of music and passion and dancing feet ... . Forenoon said they were going to visit the Batemansisters : Molly and Joan . He had seduced Joan but he had n't seduced Molly yet . Joan wanted to marry him . Molly was plump and golden and full of the devil . " She 'll make you boil like a Stanley steamer , " he said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you her name ! " " Oh yes , you told me her name . " " They 're twins . They 're twenty-two . Never fool around with girls under eighteen . If you do the law will take your pants off . " " I guess , " said Vridar , thinking of the waltz . " Good God all-Friday ! " McClintock cried . " Now what 's the matter ? " " I know some more sisters . Dark and hot . They 'll pile on you soon as you get in the door . " Vridar began to shake . He wished he had not come . " I prefer Molly , " he said . He asked for the bottle and drank and for a little while he kept swallowing like a choked dog . He looked far into the gray north where the Antelope hills lay.  | " Verna , " McClintock was saying , " will warm you up . You wo n't have to do a thing but just set and let her work on you . That girl , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . She 's that hot . . . . Well , you want her ? " " I want Molly ! " Vridar howled . " You heard me , did n't you ? " They walked down State Street and from time to time they went into an alley and drank . Vridar said he was drunk now . " I 'm drunk as a fiddler , " he said . " God , I 'm drunk as a  --  a  --  fiddler . " McClintock said he was drunk , too . When they came to Ninth South , Forenoon pointed to a great barn and said he danced there . He met Gertrude Grant there and slept with her on his third night out . " You should see me one-step , " he said . " I 'm the one-steppunest fool in Zion . " Vridar wanted to ask about Gertrude : what was she like , how did she kiss , and had she wept . Lorry Kale , that lewd sallow youth in Rigby , had said all his girls wept . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this young man had been intimate with women : with girls as lovely and clean as flowers , with girls as eager and passionate as life ; and he hated him . He choked with bitterness and grief . " I want a drink ! " he cried . " It 's all gone . " " I want a drink ! " He turned furiously and pushed Forenoon off the walk . " Damn you , I want a drink ! " " What 's the matter you ! You crazy ? " " I tell you I want a drink ! "   " Shut up that bellerun ! You fool , there is n't any drink . " " All right , I wo n't go . " He paused , sulking in self-pity . " Come on . Molly has some drink . " " But I want a drink now . I want a-get dead drunk . " " You act crazy to me . Come on . " They went up Ninth and stopped before a house . It was a shabby illbred huddle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an effort to seem what he was not , he kicked savagely at shrubs by the path ; and he kicked the steps when he reached them and then boldly kicked the door . But when Forenoon pushed a button , and when , a few moments later , a girl approached from within , Vridar began to shake . " Gosh , I 'm cold , " he said . " Shut up , " said Forenoon . " Show some breeding . " The door was opened and in the wan light Vridar saw a young girl . She was alluringly half-dressed , as if awaiting a lover . Hair fell in a cluster of ringlets to her breast . " Hello , Molly . " " Hello , " said Molly . " Come in . " Forenoon strode in and Vridar slunk after him . He found himself in a huge vulgar room with sofas and cushions everywhere and with calendars and magazine covers on the walls . With a lordly gesture , Forenoon drew his gloves off and gave them and his hat to Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , " may I present Mr. James . Mr. Vancouver James . "  | " How are you ? " asked Molly , and she gave to Vridar a small soft hand . " Where 's Joan ? " asked Forenoon . Joan was dressing . She would be out in a minute ; and if they would excuse her , Molly said , she would dress , too . As soon as she vanished , Forenoon turned to Vridar and leered . " Your name is Vancouver  --  what did I say ? " " You said James . " " James . And mine is Jack Welland . Do n't for-get . " " You mean ? " " Listen , simpleton , you heard me . You lived all your life in Antelope ? " Vridar moved toward him , murderous , shaking with rage . " Set down ! " Forenoon grasped Vridar 's shoulders . " We 're friends for life . Crooks and friends , ai n't that it ? Now play your part . . . . You 're a swell actor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He liked to be called a swell actor . He glanced at the crease in his trousers and tried to seem inscrutable and world-weary ; but he said : " I need a drink . " " Listen , " said Forenoon , whispering now . " Act bored . Always act bored around women . They like it . Seem like women was no mystery to you . " He looked at Vridar and added : " Yawn once in a while , like you 'd been up late . Be well-bred but act like you 'd been to Europe .... And call me Jack . " McClintock now walked about the room , looking at magazines and books or whistling softly or humminga love-song . He was enviably at ease , Vridar thought : a worldly chap , a prince of pilgrimage , waiting for his mistress . And Vridar strove to look bored and a little impatient ; and he , too , strolled from this to that , now turning a page , or now staring vacantly as if his thoughts were in Belfast or San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions burned to cinder under the reproachful scrutiny of his mind and he felt white and washed-out . He felt as alive with excitement , yet as aimless and futile , as autumn leaves in a wind . There was something horriblyanemic in the surge of his blood : as if it had been filtered through fear and had lost its color and heat .... From a room came girlish warbling and giggles , throaty laughter , and the sound of water boiling round a bowl . Then Joan came out . And Forenoon , Vridar perceived instantly , affected not to see her . He thumbed a book and whistled softly . " Mac , " Vridar said . McClintock turned slowly and looked at him . " Did you say Jack ? " Vridar flushed and looked silly . All the self-controlleft him . He could feel it leaving , as if siphoned , and he sank weakly to a chair . " Oh , hello , " said Forenoon , speaking to Joan . Slowly , a little wearily , he took her hand and led her across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Mr. James . Vancouver James , a grandson of Jesse James , the famous outlaw . " Vridar staggered to his feet , sweating under this new shame . He bowed as if pushed from behind ; he came up , his face red and agonized ; and then he pawed for a handkerchief and buried his face in aP253violent sneeze . He could hear Forenoon talking but he did not understand . All life , all meaning , was sucked into his humiliation , his blind furious effort to seem at ease . And he could think only of this : that he had burned like fire when introduced to a girl and then had snorted wildly . Keeping the handkerchief to his face , and having no power to look at Joan or McClintock , he turned aside , pretending for the moment to be undone . He placed a hand to his breast and coughed gently . He strove to cough when he had no need , reflecting , in bewildered fashion , that he might somehow excuse the sneeze , or at least make it seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been only a sort of cough , politely restrained too long . Because of the two , it seemed to him , coughing was more respectable . When at last he glanced up , he saw Forenoon watching him . Joan was nowhere in sight . " I told her , " Forenoon said , " I put pepper in your handkerchief . She thinks it was a joke . I told her to fetch you a drink . " " Thanks . Did she  --  did she ? " " I said you was a dead shot with a gun . Women like dead shots . And now for Christ sake straighten up . " I  --  I need a drink , " he said . He wanted the fire and courage of whiskey . Moving round the room , with McClintock 's eyes on him , he tried to realize fully what he was doing and where he was . He ached to sit by Molly and feel her warmth but the thought terrified him . And he began to tremble and he glanced again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " I got a-have a drink . " " I thought you was a good actor , " Forenoon said . Vridar shrugged and went over to a couch and sat down . Above all else , he wanted to be a good actor : an inscrutable person , affronting the world . He wanted to be stared at with annoyed baffled eyes . And now he stretched his legs out and yawned . " Listen , Welland . When do I get a drink ? Is n't there any drink in this dull stupid house ? " " That 's better . Yawn like that ever once in a while . " The girls entered the room . Joan bore glasses on a tray and came first to Vridar . " Will you have a drink ? " she asked . She smiled at him but Vridar thought her smile was a little pitying . " Thanks , " he said . Joan went to Forenoon and he rose and bowed and took a glass . " I thank you , " he said . This is very kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closely observing , was appalled . He had sat as if roped to his couch ; and McClintock , with his manners glittering , had accepted the favor with a smile , two bows , and a pretty speech . And Vridar was furious , too . In social decorum he smelled the superficial and the insincere : manners , it seemed to him , were fraud and perjury and humbug . They ambushed the soul and dressed it up in monocle and spats . " How 's it taste ? " Forenoon asked . " Oh , all right . " " Is it strong enough ? " asked Joan , smiling again . " Yes , it 's all right . "  | " He'n drink a barrel of booze , " McClintock said , " and walk a tight-rope .... " Holding his glass and hand to conceal his face , with a finger against his nose , Vridar stared at Molly . Half-buried in a fluffy dress , she looked very soft and womanly , with a bright crimson in her lips and cheeks . Vridar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like rouge . . . . And then his earnest stare fell downward to her breast and to her hips and to her ankles . She was very alluring . He tried to realize how it would feel to have her in his arms : all her supple flesh against him and all her ringlets showeringin his face . . . . He sighed and looked up , and when he saw that Molly was gazing at him , he started and almost dropped his glass . Burning in a flush , he drank his cocktail and looked round him for a place to set his glass . Molly came over , her whole face like a smile . " You have some more ? " Vridar looked up at her and her eyes held him speechless . His heart raced so wildly that he could feel a throbbing pulse in his neck . " Give him some more , " McClintock said . And now , still holding Molly 's gaze , Vridar saw the smile leave her face . He saw something like fear shadow the gray of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . Then quickly she took the glass and left the room . Again and again during his life , Vridar 's gaze had met a woman 's , as only now it had met Molly 's , and he had been delivered helpless into an indefinable power . He had felt the depth , the only profound depth , of life ; the only altitude beyond words ; the only meaning , bright and hot at its core , in the vast reaches of thought . In these moments , it seemed to him , he had touched the one universal truth . There had been such a moment years ago when he skated on the ice with Helen ; and another when , facing Neloa , he had seen beyond the surface of her life and had read her mind . But this that he felt , that shook him like a bugle , that circumferenced all his homelessness and gave it a home , answered to no name and was to be found in no books . In the great blur of consciousness , nevertheless , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it lay so deep under life and was so solitary and ancient that he could only feel its power for a moment and then lose it , as if unexpectedlyhe had touched the earth 's heart . When Molly came with another drink he looked at her again . There was nothing in her eyes now . What he had seen there was gone . In her eyes now were surfaces without depths , notions without intensityor outline or form . They were civilized eyes and there was no meaning in the civilized . He felt more at ease now . He sipped his drink andwatched McClintock and Joan . Joan was sitting onMcClintock 's lap and she was kissing him lightly  --  a large amorous kiss , Vridar reflected , that was paid intiny installments  --  and whispering in his hair . Clearlyenough she was McClintock 's to do with as he pleased . Ignoring Molly , who sat discreetly apart , Vridarstared at Forenoon . What was there in this fellowthat made him so attractive to women ? He was handsomebut there was about him so much craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muchgreed in his eyes . Nevertheless , the girls adored him.  | ... And next , Vridar studied Joan . Like her sister , she had brown hair and gray eyes and a clear healthy skin . Her body was shapely enough . But Vridar found her wholly unalluring . Her emotions like summerdays were too much alike . She was a summery girl and Molly was a summery girl : June girls , with only a hint of spring ; August girls , with only a hint of November . They would both be midsummer wives : growing calm and murmurous , growing plump for death ... . But Neloa : she had the tragic in her , and passion that could be dark and wild . And with whiskey homesickness he thought of her . Neloa and the AntelopeHills and all the desolate backdrop of his home were in the blur around him ; until he sank into selfpityand loneliness , with memory walling him in . His glass was filled again and he drank . His stare duringa long hour of silence was fixed on his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his hat and staggered out.  |p258HE  WALKED under a clear bright sky . Looking into the valley of stars or into the north at the mammoth shadows of sleep , he thought of his homeland , with its quiet nights full of silence , its mountainsmute with age . And he thought of Neloa . For two weeks now she had not written , nor had he , and he was done with her now . She could go to hell and high water for all he cared . She could break her faithlessneck or be the mistress of all the earth 's bawcocks or take to whoredom and little he would care ... . But these reflections made him sniffle with grief . The mist of his eyes was condensed to tears , and great sobs rose and choked him . There came out of him a sudden bawling sound , as if he had been branded with a hot iron ; and then , in despair with himself , he smote his forehead to clear his wits . He looked back and saw the light . McClintock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was here , bubbling with woe like a spanked child . All around him were women but he had none of them . He thought of them with wolfish hunger : of their breasts and thighs and lips ; he peopled his fancy with them and devouredtheir presence , until he was only a male , the one male , the avid life-principle , fecundating a voluptuousspermy mass around him . He was an organ throwing seeds and all life , warm and supple , pressed upon him ; and in this that was meaningless was the only meaning ; in this that was beastly and shameful was the only beauty , the only good . What he wanted , standing here now , silent and furious and staring atp259the light , was an orgy of lust so that he could deliver himself from bondage , from sterile saintliness and fear . He wanted to thrust his emotion , sharp and piercing , into the heart of life . But he went on down the street , being too sober for courage , and turned north . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negress . She was a foul hag , toothless and old . Vridar stared at her and wondered if she was a beggar or a lunatic ; and she took him by an arm and tried to lead him into an alley ; and in a whining voice she said to him , " Only two bits , kid . Just a quarter . Just two bits .... " Understanding but faintly , yet knowing her purposeto be vile , Vridar jerked away from her and ran . He glanced back and saw her watching him . For a little while they looked at each other ; and then she approached , but softly , lest she frighten him away . And again Vridar took to his heels and he did not pause until he came to the lighted areas of town . Standing on a corner he pondered the matter . He still had no good notion of what she had proposed . His mind reached out to the Bible , with its records of degeneracy ; and he thought of words he had seen  --  sodomy and lesbianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  terriblewords all , black with significance , but vague and perplexing in his own mind . He thought of gonorrhea . McClintock had come home with gonorrhea and had yelped thereafter when he went to the bathroom . And that and syphilis and all these others were common , it seemed , to the human being but not to other animals ; and Vridar thought with wonder of his own kind ... .  | The son-of-a-bitch ! " McClintock had howled . " I spent five bucks on that skirt and she give me this ! ... Did you know some sorority girls is plain damn whores ? ... " And Vridar thought , too , of ancient Sybaris and its women , and of Francastoro 's Syphilus , and of the gusto picaresco of Ashur-bani-pal . These and many more were bright lights , still shining in the dead acres of history . Life had touched Villon and Salome , Psyche and Proserpine and Semele , and they had burst into flame ; and the ashes of the flame , somehow , were pox ... . But all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation . His mind had cleared . Under the stars there was good , there was evil , and his life was dedicated to the good . And while he walked the streets , he remembered , with a little bitterness , that he was to be a great and good man . He was to be a scourger of sin , a trumpet on the narrow lane into Heaven ... . But when he passed a lovely girl , and noted her quick glance of inquiry , his heart leapt and his resolutions fell like dust . He turned to look at her and saw that she was looking back at him . He followed her then , but discreetly ; and when he saw that she was loitering , he stopped by a window and looked in . She turned and glanced back at him and smiled . Was she a harlot , he asked himself . Great God , how was he to know ! Girls were an undecipherable lot . With hearts lusting , they could look as sweet and demure as a nun ; and they seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for prophets ; and that God , who had gibbeted His Son between two thieves , was full of woe . Even the best of women wore theirp261virtue lightly . It was only a gown , diaphanous , clinging ; and gracefully , without shame , they could lay it aside .... McClintock would take a virgin to church on Sunday and seduce her on Sunday eve . And that showed what shameless trulls women could be ! Intimacyof flesh was all right : there could hardly be life without it : but Sunday was not the time for it , and a living-room sofa was not the place . On Sunday the heart ought to lift in prayer and the soul ought to journey among the white altitudes ... . Such were Vridar 's meditations as he stared unseeingat forty pairs of shoes . The girl who had smiled at him was gone now . He went up the street and anothergirl smiled  --  a stodgy wench with arms like a bridge beam . Vridar looked back and he saw that across her rump she was as broad as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were to sell himself into sin , it would be for a slender fragrant girl , for a shy and modest girl . . . . I ought to go home , he thought . But he stopped on a corner and watched girls pass , his heart lusting after them . They filled him with intolerablepain . They made him afraid of himself ; for he had , again and again , an almost uncontrollable wish to go after one and crush her in his arms until she yielded and ran limp . It would be a small , an indefinable , thing that would make his blood surge : the turn of a head , the moving curve of a breast , or something in the walk . And when he turned home at last , his starved eyes searched the streets . When he was beyond the lights , he saw no girls and he drew a deep sigh . As he climbed the stairway of his home he was set upon by a strange wish . It leapt out of nothing and sat like a devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He strove to put it away but it grew in size until he was full of it . He hoped that McClintock caught gonorrhea tonight . On the next morning Forenoon was derisive . " You 're a hot one , " he said . " I did n't know a girl could scare your pants off . " He stared in pity at Vridar and Vridar scowled . " Joan wanted to know was you impotent or bashful . I said you was impotent . I said you was just a steer . " " Go to hell ! " Vridar said . " I said you did n't have any beard . That , I said , showed you was only a steer . " " Shut it up ! Say much more and you 'll think I 'm a steer ! " Forenoon eyed him with sardonic contempt . He rose and walked round him as if to see what sort of animal he was . And then he snickered and clapped a hand to his snickers . " Why do n't you be a monk ? Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at him , his eyes murderous . Then he gathered the clothes he had worn and hung them in a closet and while he was in the closet , Forenoonshut and locked the door . " Let me out ! " Vridar howled . " You 're in a monastery now , " McClintock told him . " Women wo n't scare you now .... You want a bible ? " " I 'll kill you when I get out ! "  | " You 're a monk now . I 'll buy you a rosary or something . How about some beads ? " Vridar seethed with fury and listened . He heard Forenoon dressing and in a little while he heard him gather his books and leave the house . Vridar smote the door but it was sturdy and well-secured : he was trapped here , locked up like a wayward child , as he had been at the Jew 's ; and in blind rage he jerked clothes down and kicked them ; seized one of Forenoon'scoats and tried to tear an arm off ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours he remained within this closet and during this while he plotted vengeance : evolving one scheme and another , dwelling in earnest thought on the details of each . His first plan was to bring upon Forenoon a public scandal . He would denounce him from the housetops as a thief and a wastrel and a liar ; and then he perceived that this would not do , for they were both thieves , even though Vridar looked on his own pilfering as the avenging of an insult ... . His next plan was to expose Forenoon 's identity , and his unscrupulous cunning , to a dozen ravished virgins . He would write letters to them . He would say : Dear Miss Bateman : It may interest you to know that Jack Welland is A. M. McClintock , that he is a liar and a fraud , and that he has three bastards in Salt Lake City ; and that the number of simpletons like yourself who have trusted him is enough to fill any ordinary asylum . . . . Or he would say : It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are remarkably stupid . It should have occurred to you  --  as quite certainly it has not  --  that Jack Welland is a cheap modern synonym for Don Juan . Was it Byron who said women ought to be taken and used and thrown away ? It amuses me , dear lady , to observe how nicely you support that statement ... . But no : he would not stoop to such underground methods . He would punish above board with clean powerful blows . He would tell Forenoon to stand up and then he would drive a fist into the villain 's teeth ; or , more romantically , he would invite him to a duel . And for a long while he was left meditating on duels and on glittering exploits with pistol or sword . He wished that dueling was in vogue now . If it were , he would get a brace of pistols and a ton of ammunition and retire to six months of practice ; and then he would be , like Plummer of Alder Gulch , a dead shot and a dangerous man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to duels : snobbish fraternity men , Archibald Drake , Neloa 's three lovers , and McClintock . In a gray dawn somewhere under a ceiling of oaks he would shoot all of them and calmly sheathe his pistol and walk away . Or he would open their veins with a sword ... . But these meditations sickened him . He thought of the smell of blood and the darkness and agony of death , and he knew that he could never kill a man . He recoiled even from the killing of mice and rats and horseflies . Nor could he strike Forenoon in his teeth , because another 's pain distressed him more than his own . . . . No , his blood was whey . He was only a woman with a man 's parts . And he wished with intensitythat choked him that he could go forth , as the conquerors of history had gone , and raze kingdoms in the name of Jesus , invoke death in the name ofp265God . To his greedy ambition , the Corsican runt had sacrificed armies ; and Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were great names in the long corridor of time . Nero and Ivan the Terrible were still held in respect . But he  --  he sat in a closet , a witless zany who recoiledfrom murder and might ; who called himself a socialist because he despised war ; and who , when put upon as now , fretted in rage and then turned his other cheek . He still believed in the Nazarene . He was homeless in a Christian world ... . Nor did these thoughts comfort him . He threshed about again , lusting for vengeance ; and when he heard Forenoon enter the room , he howled with profanity and threat . " Hello ! " said Forenoon . " You still in there ? .. . I told your profs you was a monk now . You 'd gone into the desert , I said , to flog yourself a while . " Forenoonbegan to whistle . " Say , I got you a suit of camel hair . Go to Nevada . That 's got a wad of desert . Wyoming , too . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Ever read about Jonah ? There 's a gink for you to pattern by .... " In a few minutes he came over and unlocked the door . Vridar stepped out and grinned but the muscles of his face twitched . He went to the kitchen and ate . During the evening , McClintock said he was steppingout . He shaved , he oiled his hair and powdered and rouged his face , and then he began to dress . He had a new flame , he said . Her name was Alice Hansonand she was a pretty article to look at . She didn't wear corsets or garters , and when she kissed , she gave all her skill to it . " You better go back in your monastery , " he said . " You got a bible ? My God , you should have a bible . ... How do you know what to believe without you read a bible ? " He leered at Vridar and showed him his new studs and he went to a mirror and looked at his handsome face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiped them . You know , that jewelry shop I worked in last Saturday . And a swell opera glass . You should see it . Your eyes would stand out like the breasts on a woman . " Then he went to the closet . His amazement he vented first in a grunt and next in a howl . He was holding the silk shirt that Vridar had torn into ribbons . And suddenly he dropped it and sprang to a wardrobe and seized a shirt and ripped it in two . " Stop that ! " Vridar yelled . Forenoon raced to the closet , seeking Vridar 's garments there ; he plowed inside , barking with rage ; and in one leap Vridar sprang to the door and shut it and locked it . " Let me out ! " Forenoon roared . " You son-of-abitch , I 'll beat your brains out ! " He raised a great storm in the closet . He smote and howled , and he jumped on the floor until the building shook . " You 'll be sorry ! I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dewlap ! You lousy stinking Antelope hick ! " He was profaning wickedly now . " Stop it ! " Vridar said . " You 'll break the door ! " " You cockeyed right I 'll break the door ! I 'll tearthe God-damn house down ! " He was bellowing likep267a fiend now . He said he would knock all Vridar 's teeth down into his tonsils . " You pig-feeder ! You Antelope cow-milker ! I swear to Christ I 'll beat your gizzard out ! ... " At this moment the door was opened and the landlady came in , her eyes almost weird with fright and rage . The closet door was shaking and Forenoon behind it was cursing and kicking , and the woman looked at the door as if spellbound . Then she went to the door and tried to turn the key , and McClintock , meanwhile , poured at her his insulting abuse . " You son-of-a-bitch , you better let me out ! You gutter-snipe ! You beardless half-witted Mormon ! " Then the key was turned and Forenoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a window ; and glass fell in a shower and the woman screamed . She struggled to her feet and screamed again and Forenoon stared at her . And she looked at him and wailed like a squaw and wrung her hands . " Let 's beat it ! " Forenoon said to Vridar . Still looking at McClintock as if he were the Devil , the woman left the room and then peered in . Her teeth chattered and she could hardly speak . She opened and shut her mouth like a dying fish . " You  --  get  --  out ! " she cried . She thrust a shaking arm at Forenoon and said : " Get out ! " " I will , " Forenoon said . The woman now stared at the broken window . She sobbed . " I 'll  --  call the police ! " Her voice was hysterical . " We 'll pay for the window , " Vridar said . " We 'll move right now . " They began to pack and the woman stared at them . Forenoon said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway , the woman shrank from him as from a leper . She gestured at Vridar with a bony arm and wailed . " You , too ! " " Soon as I pack , " Vridar assured her . " We 'll be gone soon . " And he and Mertyl worked swiftly , rolling clothinginto bundles , tying strings around books . In a few minutes McClintock returned . He had a place , he said . They carried stuff to the sidewalk and then entered their kitchen and looked at their assortment of groceries , banked against the walls . " Let 's leave it , " Vridar said . " Hell no ! " McClintock said . He gathered armfuls and carried them downstairs . Shrinking to a wall , the woman eyed him , her gaze bright with fear and loathing . McClintock left a pile of groceries in the kitchen . " They 'll pay for your damn window , " he said . " You get out ! " she said . They went down and stood on the sidewalk and in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They entered an enormous room . It was forty feet long , half as wide , and had a high ceiling . " We'n play baseball in here , " McClintock said . They opened tins of peas and beef and pears and dumped the contents into pots . They sat by a rickety table and ate . " That woman was crazy , " McClintock said . " She acted like it , " Vridar said . " She talks to herself . You know that ? . . . She just prowls around and mumbles . " " I know . I heard her . "  | " That 's what happens when they do n't get a man . Now me , I do a lot of good in the world . I 'll save a lot of girls from mumblun around . You ever think of that ? " While they were eating , the door was opened softlyand a face looked in . It was the intent curious face of a lovely girl . " Hello , " McClintock said . The face did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who are you ? " " I 'm Anna Mullen . " " The hell you are . Well , Miss Mullen , come in . " " No . " Forenoon looked at Vridar . He looked again at Anna . " Why do n't you come in ? " " I do n't want to . " " How old are you ? " " Nineteen . " " Come on in . Let me see what you look like . " But Anna did not budge . Her face was still sober , curious . One hand drew the door against her cheek . " You 're a swell-lookun girl , " McClintock said . " You live here ? " " Yes . My father owns this place . " " You do n't say . Then you 're an heiress . " " A what ? " asked the girl , her face as changeless as still water . " Come in ! We wo n't hurt you . I 'm nice to goodlookungirls . " " I 'll bet . " " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters in college . " " Yes , I 'll bet . "  | " Why do n't you come in ? " " I said I do n't want to . " Forenoon looked again at Vridar . This , clearly , was too much for him . " Where 's your room ? " " My room ? " " Yes , where you sleep . " " Just across the hall . " " Fine . I 'll be over tonight . " " No you wo n't . " " Why wo n't I ? What would you do ? " " I 'd call my father . " " Your father ! I 'd run him through a meatgrinderand feed him to the cats . I 'd cut his ears off . " " Yes , I 'll bet . " " What color 's your eyes ? " " Blue , I guess . " " I 'll find out , " Forenoon said . But when he started toward her , the door was softly closed . He opened it and looked out but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What the hell do you think about her ? Is she a halfwit ? " " I do n't know . " " Well , I 'll be all curled up in her bed in a week . " Vridar listened to Forenoon 's boasting and said nothing . He was thinking with melancholy tendernessof this girl , and of himself as her guardian , and of the noble work that he would do in life . He would be a big brother to this girl . She would be his sister and he would guide and teach her and she would be all right.  | ON THE next morning , Forenoon prowled in hallways , looking for the girl . He stood on a chair and peered through transoms ; he tried one door and another and found them all unlocked . And in the evening of this day , when Vridar was trying to study and McClintock was pressing a suit , the girl opened the door and looked in . She stared at them gravely as if they were strangers from a far shore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You back again ? " " Yes , " the girl said . " Come on in . " " No . " Vridar thought perhaps she would come in if he spoke . He liked to believe that her interest was in him and that she trusted him . " Wo n't you come in ? " he said . " No . " His self-esteem momentarily collapsed . Well , she was only a silly thing after all : orphan asylums and poorhouses were full of her seed . She could be abductedand sold into a harem for all he cared . And he tried to ignore her . " Let 's go to a show , " Forenoon said . " When ? " asked the girl . " Right now . " " All right . " Forenoon lathered his face and began to shave , and Anna watched him ; and Vridar , self-appointed guardian of innocence , hated her and wished all women were dead . No sensible girl , he assured himself , and least of all a stranger , would go anywhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one purpose in mind . . . . He looked at the girl but she was unaware of his scornful eyes . She was gazing at Forenoon with rapt interest . " Run along and get ready . " She shut the door and went away . McClintock grinned . " When I get done with her she 'll wear a surprised look for life . " " Balderdash ! " Vridar said . " All right . Just notice how she acts tomorrow . She wo n't cost me a cent . Just a show ticket , that 's all . " Vridar went to the long front porch . He came out here , he would have told you , because he was sick of McClintock and his ways , of women and the world ; but his real reason , unperceived by himself , was a desire to waylay Anna and admonish her . He wanted to say to her , " Take my advice and leave that man alone . He 'll ruin you . " And still deeper within lay the words : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the kind all women should go with . You must be awfully silly not to know that .... " But though he paced , with his emotions savage , from end to end of the porch , he saw nothing of Anna ; because she , foolish wench , intolerable blockhead , was busy whitewashing her face . And Vridar was still here , striding like a mighty one , delivering his wrath into phrases , when Forenoon and Anna emerged , the first busy with feeble witticisms , the second with giggles . " Aufwedderseen ! " Forenoon called . " Odoise and Bone joor ! "  |p273Vridar  scowled at him . McClintock stopped on the sidewalk and spoke again . " Eine der Taguszeit beeten ! " he called , for he had studied German . " Moot fassen ! " " Das dumme Geschwatz ! " Vridar said . " Vreed and me , " he said to Anna , " we both speak a dozen languages . " " Yes , I 'll bet . " " Do n't we , Vreed ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to talk in ? French ? Spanish ? Jap ? Swedish ? " " Russian , " Anna said . " Sure . Lodl-pook ig yikkum doglogoskowsky . Miggum thwab viginsky ag toag wog shikklevitch . " He looked at her and grinned . " How 's that ? " " Aw , go on ! " " You 're ignorant , " Forenoon said . " You would n't know Russian if you heard it . " They went down the street and Vridar watched them go . When he could no longer see them from the porch , he went out to the sidewalk , but they had disappeared . He returned to the house , walking like an old man , and went into the huge emptiness of his room . Mertyl was devoting himself to a book . What a calm and unemotional zany his brother was ! He would sit for hours , poring over logarithms and equationsand formulae as senseless as runes ; indifferent to the vast reaches of life and love , the fragrant and devious lanes , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this year , as in years past , as in many years to come , knew nothing of Mertyl and Mertyl 's thoughts . He regarded him now as a pious lad , a bit innocuous , a bit sluggish : likely to become a missionary or a husband : a dull and studious fellow for whom two and two were four . And when , in a later year , he discovered all that Mertyl was , all that he , too , had suffered and buried ... . Vridar strove to study but books made him furious tonight . Books , he reflected , were the epidermis of experience : lovely sometimes , as hair was lovely , and living in the way that hair lived , without blood and heart . He left the room and walked in dusk . He thought of Neloa , for she had not written in a long while . Perhaps she was kissing another man now . And as he looked at the city 's lights , he wished he had the strength , the courage , to debauch himself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . He returned to the porch and sat here , despising himself . In a little while McClintock and Anna came out of the night . They came in silence and entered the house and Vridar followed them in . Forenoon sat on a bed and looked very cynical and vindictive . " Must a-been a quick show , " Vridar said . Forenoon 's sneer spread to his eyes . It wrinkled his forehead and drew lines to his ears . And he stared at Vridar with infinite contempt . " You'n have her , " he said . " Who ? " Vridar asked ; but he knew . " That lousy filthy trull . " " I do n't want her . " " Sure you do . You'n be a missionary with her . You'n clean her up and teach her to bathe . " He wrinkled his nose as if smelling a stench . " God ! You smell her ? " " Smell her ! I do n't go around smelling girls . "  | " You would n't have to go far to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we got out on the street and I thought I was smellun the street . But it was her all the time . She stinks like fury . " He groaned and clutched his face . He looked up and spoke again . " I do n't mind clean dirt . Country dirt . But hers is civilized dirt . . . . Mary Smith , she was never clean ; but hell , she did n't stink ! " He stood up and made a face . " Did n't you take her to a show ? " Vridar asked . " Do n't be funny with me . When I spend money on a woman I invest it . Like in a bank . I expect interest . . . . If I spend any money on her it 'll be for soap . Dutch cleanser . " He got his book of telephone numbers and turned the leaves . " I'n learn you a lot , " he said , looking at Vridar . " You 're just a greenhorn . One thing you got a-learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell like fried cabbage . Always take a sniff of a girl first . " With his book of numbers he went to a drugstore . He came back and bathed and then rubbed himself with scented oil . " Let 's go to a dance , " he said . " When ? " " Tonight . Right now . " Vridar considered . " Where 'd we go ? " " Bonneville . Swell dancers there . And they do n't stink , either . " " I have n't any clothes . " " Wear mine . " " I 'm sick of wearing yours . " " All right . But you wo n't find many friends let you wear their clothes . You do n't appreciate that . You ever stop to think how much I do for you ? " Vridar began to tremble . He thought of all those bitter times when he went to dances in Rigby and never danced ; when he stood in self-hatred and looked on until his heart broke and he wept . In memory he could hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't learn no younger . " " Let me think . " He left the house , trying to see his way clearly . Going to a corner , he stared up and down the street , and far away in the dark he could hear , or believed he could hear , a violin . It was playing a waltz and the mournful tenderness of it made him shake . And in this moment he realized long afterward , he made one of the important decisions of his life . He swung in feverish haste and ran back to the house and burst in . " I 'll go ! " he said.  | THE Bonneville was the largest and most vulgar hall in the city . While a grocer 's clerk , Vridar had heard of its doings and had inferred the character of persons who went there . Its patrons were shopgirlsand harlots , young men from all trades , and drug peddlers and sharpers and erotic mountebanks . A few months ago , he would no more have gone to Bonneville than he would have entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four months . Passions long held in check , hungers that had never fed , were possessing him now . He was still pious , he was still greedy for a pure and noble life ; he still clung to the unction of a mission on earth ; and he despised , with a mightiness born largely of self-pity , the hypocrisy and pomp , the Edens and fleshpots of the world ; but he was now driven by a hunger and a loneliness greaterthan his will . And tonight , dressed in his own shabby suit , but wearing shoes and necktie belonging to another , he went with misgivings , yet with a singing heart . Young men , he reflected , often went to the dogs . The road to hell was broad and odorous , a lusty journeyingfrom tavern to tavern , and he was on his way to a tavern now . God alone knew what would come of it . He might become a guzzling libertine , an overgorgedpig , befuddling his wits and dissipating the fine lucid quality of his mind . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lust after carnal things that no power could save him , so sotted would he be . And these reflections both terrified and pleased him . It was good to think of himself as a man bloated with ravishments , as a man fleeing to the devil ; for he had been such a good youth and the pride of so many . For so many terrible years he had tried to do the right thing and had been paid with aconite ... . " Listen , " Forenoon said . " I know lots of swell girls here but they like swell dancers . You 'll have to just pick up some till you learn . " Vridar considered . The question in his mind was silly but he had to ask it . " How , " he said , " do you  --  pick them up ? " " Oh , just bow and smile and say , Can I have this dance ? " " Thanks , " Vridar said . They entered an enormous hall . It was alive with music and dancing and lovely girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wishing to hide for a while , but Forenoon grasped his arm and led him , crimson and expostulating , to the flood of light . They stood by a huge rope  --  the floor was fenced off  --  and watched the crowd ; and Vridar 's heart sank . He wished he had not come . For out on that gleaming floor was such grace , such variety of movement , such adroit gliding and skimming and whirling , that he felt lost . He saw no one who seemed not to dance well . And besides all this , the men were so polished and insolent , the girls so splendidly haughty , that in comparison with them , he imagined himself to be the gawkiest oaf anywhere . If he tried to dance , he would be hissed , as likely as not , and perhaps thrown out like a sack of meal . " Well , " Forenoon said , " let 's dance . "  | " No ! " Vridar turned rigid with fright . " You dance . I  --  I 'll stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I said ! You dance . You dance and I 'll watch how you do . " Forenoon was flattered . He went to a group of girls and a few moments later he was gliding superbly in a one-step . This involved one-step glide , attempted , Vridar observed , by only a few , was for him an amazing feat . He could never do it . If he practised a thousand years , he could never do anything like that . He drew a deep sigh and looked about him . Standing in groups were scores of young men and young women . Some of the men , he noted , were much like himself : their faces were starved and hopeless , as if they had tried to dance and had been jerked off the floor . But the idle girls tongued gum with open-mouthed relish and looked as unapproachable as the summit of Mount Everest . And next Vridar studied the men who danced . He summarized all of them as fops and carpet knights . In a college they would be fraternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and pitied his race . McClintock came , nimble and leering , close to the rope . " Come on ! " he said . " Get you a jane ! " Vridar stared at McClintock 's girl : she was tall and queenly and scornful . She looked at Vridar , half in wonder , half in astonishment , and floated away . He turned and went outside . For several minutes he stood in cold air and looked at the stars . His destiny lay up there . He was born ,  | not to lope around in sexual antics , but to scourge impostors and build stairways to light . History 's great men , as often as not , had been bachelors ; and those who had taken women , as Byron and Napoleon had done , soon threw them away . What did Wordsworthknow of dancing ? or Keats or Shelley ? Newtonand Rabelais ? Imagine Dante shimmying around a vulgar hall ! . . . No , he ought to be sitting by a fireside , under a golden lamp , with the Odyssey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or studying Wagnerian opera or reading Kant ... . But the music poured out upon him , frenzied , mad : a tide of sound , full of the jungle and of mating : a medley of preludes and overtures to lust . It was Belial 's orchestra , playing to the fallen angels . And Vridar moved away from it , thinking he would go home ; but his feet were heavy and he stopped . Why should he go to an enormous cold room and a dead book ? Here was life around him , delirious with passion , and here were women , ready for the male . In his room were the ashes of Rydal Mount . Here was the raw spermy stuff of life . Here hunger beat in the tom-toms , barked through the cornets , roared in the trombone . It was life . Its furious vitality called to him and he answered , for it was his heritage and his meaning , and books were only an annotated death . And he paced around in darkness and he was racked by an awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to dance , that he would have to get into life and feel it and smell it , or go mad . Fighting for calm , he went twice around a block and then entered the hall . He entered with a fixed ,  |p281an  unalterable , purpose , that gave to his face a desperatesoberness and to his eyes a morbid stare . He saw a group of girls apart , and one of them , he thought , looked rather dowdy and forgotten . Perhapsshe would dance with him . He went to this girl and in a voice that shook he asked : " Will you dance with me ? " She turned and looked at him . She was shapeless of body and sour of mien . She hesitated ; and then , " All right , " she said and walked to the floor . Vridar followed . He gave a ticket to the man at the gate . He circled the girl 's waist , hardly knowing what he did , and moved off , his emotions rocking him like savage wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled , his face burning , all his flesh burning , under the stares which he imagined were upon him . The dance was a fox-trot but it might as well have been an Elizabethan jig for all he knew . He kept his eyes down and fumbled with sightless courage round and round . Then the girl stopped . " I want a-quit , " she said . " You  --  you what ? " " I said I want a-quit ! You heard me . " She walked away and Vridar was left here on the floor . The hall was like sheets of pale fire . In the glowing mist , he saw dancers moving round him , knew they were looking at him ; and he plowed through them , going like one to his death , and found the night . He hid in shadow where none could see and tried not to remember . The girl had spurned him and walked away and memory of this was like mem- ory of nightmare . " My God ! " he groaned and began to shake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutiny and he jumped about and flogged himself . He called himself a fool and smote his breast . He called himself a dolt and a milksop and a blockhead , a lummox and a halfwit , and said he would kill himself : the one personality , unpitying and calm , speaking in scathing derision of the other . . . . Well , he would go back and dance , and to hell with what anyone thought . " I 'll go back ! " he said , speaking aloud . He hopped around and shook himself . And to assure himself , he reflected  --  as in how many former whiles and with what fruitless results !  --  that these dancers were not worth his shoe-string . They were an assortment of nobodies . Not one of them would ever reach beyond his home township : they would be housewives and clerks and bond-salesmen and whores . " So why should I care ! " he cried . " What difference , " he thought , in utter despair , " does it make to me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now abusing himself , now reasoning ; and he was not vanquished yet . Once he set his heart on a thing , he was like his father : he never turned back . He could be outraged until his grief was like gall , his self-esteem like a handful of chaff ; but he would rise again and fight . He would try , with what cunning he had , to restore his confidence , to clear his wits , and he would return , like a man driven by lashes , to the scene of his humiliation . And now , as he entered the hall , he was almost white with desperation . Now he would meet scornp283with scorn . And now , too , because he loathed his weakness , he resolved to force himself , as with a hot pike , to the severest ordeals : to refuse to count one girl more approachable than another ; to go , in every case , to the first one he saw ... . " Will you dance with me ? " She looked at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and came back to his eyes ; and in the way she stared at him , he could see no disdain : only a well-disciplined curiousness , patient , unamazed . She did not speak . And Vridar waited ; and in a moment a fellow came up and led the girl to the dance . Sweating under the studied thoroughness of this rebuke , Vridar swung and looked around him . He went to the group of girls nearest him . " Will you dance with me ? " She turned as if mildly astonished . She was chewinggum , and flakes of rouge patched the flesh of her lip . " You speakun to me ? " " I asked if you 'd care to dance . " She looked at the other girls and then looked at Vridar and grinned . The other girls pretended not to see him . Vridar waited for several moments . " Will you ? " he said . " No , " the girl said . Her face hardened and she turned away . Feeling his courage sink , Vridar swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again . He chose another group and went over to it . He asked the same question . The four girls fell twitter- ing against one another . They all looked at him as if amazed and then laughed outright . And Vridar fled to a corner to meditate . His forehead was wet and a muscle in his face twitched . He looked at the girls , hating them , praying that they all married blackguardsand pimps . And while he stood here , McClintockcame . " What 's a-matter ? Why do n't you dance ? " " They wo n't dance with me . " He looked at Forenoonand added : " I guess they like your type . " " It 's because you ca n't dance , " Forenoon said . " Itell you : come with me and we 'll butt into some . " " It would n't do any good . " " Sure . Come on . " And as they moved through the crowds , McClintock advised him . " Do n't let girls see you watchun them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dance , you'n drag them on . Some women like to be knocked around . Some like to be kidded . Some like to be flattered . " With Vridar faithfully at his side , McClintock accosted three girls . " Hello , " he said . " Seems like I know you . You go to the College ? " The girl addressed was nonplussed and a little amazed , but she was also , Vridar could see , a little pleased . " These are college girls , " McClintock went on , speaking to Vridar . " Ai n't you seen them on the campus ? " " I  --  I think so , " Vridar said . The girls looked at one another . They were flattered.  | " Damn it , " Forenoon said , " I know now where I seen them . I seen them at the Junior Prom ... . Did n't I ? " he asked of one of the girls . One of the girls giggled , another 's face broke into a smile . " How about a dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The girls looked wonderingly at each other and then at Forenoon . " You go to the College ? " one asked . " Sure , " McClintock said . " So do you . I 've seen you there . " " You must a-been seeun ghosts , " she said . McClintock now affected a troubled earnestness . I lc appealed to another girl . " Honest now , are n't you a Chi Omega ? " " Heck no , " the girl said . " I wish I was . " " You 're the Chi Omega type , " Forenoon said . And he quickly added : " Let 's dance . " He took her arm and led her away and Vridar was left facing the other two . " I  --  uh  --  will you dance with me ? " " You go to the College ? " " Yes . " " You know Ann Morris ? " " Ann Morris ? No , I guess not . " " She goes . She 's a Delta . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vridar did n't know whether he should stand his ground or slink away . And should he ask again for a dance ? He glanced at his shoes , at his hands ; he drew forth a letter and tried to look at it with sober interest , and he rocked a little on his heels end toes and shrugged ; but he felt unspeakably silly.  | Persons roundabout , he noted , were staring at him curiously . He began to sweat and he felt drenched with heat and weakness . Then he moved away , looking , meanwhile , over the crowds , as if he had thought of someone whom he must see . He even stood tiptoe and peered . And he moved from place to place as if searching and his acting was thorough . Instead of retiring and becoming lost , he kept himself in view ; he went from group to group , his gaze sweeping the hall ; and he returned , after a few minutes , to those who had watched him curiously , determined to convincethem , beyond all doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed increasing disappointment . He scowled and looked annoyed and from time to time he glanced at a clock in the building 's end . And this dramatizing of his shame and fear became so real for him that he almost believed , after a while , that he was searching . He lifted his brows , he would show sudden interest , as if he recognized the one he sought ; and he would go rapidly away , looking over heads , as if to keep his quest in sight . He was still acting his part when McClintock grasped his arm . And now , instead of being himself , Vridar clung to his pretense . He tiptoed , with a hand on Forenoon 's shoulder ; and he said , " I think I saw a college girl here . " And in a few moments ( and quite as he had intended ) he had McClintock staring about , and they went together , exploring from group to group . Vridar was satisfied . The curious , he believed , must be convinced now . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was bold and oblivious , and that none but a worldly fellow could have prowled around in such fashion . And they had forgotten , he hoped , his humiliating episode with the girls . " Come on , " McClintock said . " Let 's butt into some more . " Vridar went with him and presently Forenoon said , " I see two . Do n't look . One in red , one in blue . " They turned and came back and Vridar glanced at the girls . They went through the crowd and lost themselves and returned . " Hello , " Forenoon said . " Where you been hiding ? " " Us hidun ! " one cried . " You remember me ? " Forenoon said . " I danced with you at the Odeon . " He turned to Vridar and shrugged . " You see ? I danced with her a month ago . Now she do n't know me . If I 'd been the Prince of Wales or the sultan of Whamtam . . . . " The girls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I danced with you twice , " Forenoon declared to the lovelier girl of the two . " I asked if you ever went to Bonneville . You said yes . I said I 'd see you here and you said all right . And now you pretend you do n't remember ! " His tone was aggrieved . He shrugged again . " Sure , " said the one in blue . " I remember . You asked would I give you my phone number and I would n't . " " Exactly . And I been sad ever since . I been lookun for you in cellars and attics and closets and trunks and coal bins . That 's why I asked where you been hiding ? "  | " Would n't you like to know ! " " Sure would . I 'd sit on your doorstep and wag my tail all night . " The girl in blue twittered . The other girl smiled . Said the one in blue : " We do n't usually dance with men without a introduction . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right arm across his chest and his left arm to Vridar . " Miss Beautiful , may I present Mr. Vancouver James ? Miss Lovely , " he said , bowing to the other girl , " Mr. James . And now I have the honor to present myself , Mr. Jack Welland of Wasatch College . " The girls looked startled but they were pleased . " You say things in a nice way , " the one in blue said . " You 're sure original . " " Jack ' Welland , " the other said . " Seems like I 've heard that name . " She turned to her companion . " Ai n't you ? " " Seems I have . You play football ? " " I 'm the left halfwit  --  I mean halfback . James here is the middle , I mean the center . " " I knowed I 'd heard your names , " the girl said . She was warming to McClintock now . Her smile had lost its ice . " And now for that dance you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vridar asked of the girl in red . " Thanks . I do n't care to . " Vridar looked at her . What he saw in her face filled him with sudden rage . He went to a bench and sat down .... And twice more during this evening , he was Forenoon 's companion in accosting girls ; twicep289more McClintock danced with strangers , once draggingan unwilling maid to the floor , and once flatteringanother by saying she looked like Norma Talmadge . And twice Vridar was left , bewildered and sweating , to seek a hiding-place . During the last hour , he sat in a far corner , bitterlyreflecting on women . They capitulated to the most stupid flattery . They showed no more acumen than that of a chicken with its head under its wing . Men they judged by their clothes and by their tongues : like birds , they chose as mate the one most gaily attired , employing , in an age of reason , a biology now ancient and silly . Like frost on a pane , their emotions lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under unctuous flummery ; and showing then , like the pane , a wintry emptiness beyond . He walked home and he felt a vast friendliness toward hermits and monks and all the other weird celibates of history . Caught up by passion not of their choosing , and shaken like a rat in a dog 's mouth , they went off to scourge themselves and make themselvesclean . They repudiated God 's vulgar way of raising life from dust . Because men  --  great and worthy fellows like himself  --  aspired to nebular kingdoms , but were overhauled , in nine times out of ten , by a woman 's arms . A woman laid her hands on a mate and the law gave to her a first mortgage on him . She got a deed for him , as she might for any other sort of property ; and thereupon she staked him in her domain , to use as whim prompted , for breeding and toil . If a man escaped , he was thrown into jail like a bull into a paddock . If he fled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the luckless zany would find himself mortgaged again ; until at last , fleeing in and out of marriage , he would yield to despair , and reserve to himself only one privilege , that of death ... . In an ugly mood , Vridar entered his room . He stared at Mertyl a little while and then delivered himself of furious resentment against women and life . " I 'm a fool ! " he cried . " I 've been to a dance ! I have girl on the brain ! I should a-been studying and I 'm running after girls like a dog after a bitch ! And God knows why ! . . . Why should I fool with girls ? They 're a bunch of nitwits ! And life , what is it but a cockeyed blunder that God made and is ashamed of ! Greed , superstition , lying , whoring ! A big asylum in which men chase women ! A thing called marriage that legalizes lust ! Lust and greed , greed and lust ! " He stopped , trembling with hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water but he did not drink . He looked at the cup and set it down . " I wish I had never been born ! " he roared . " I did n't ask to be born , did I ? I was put here and even God Himself could n't tell why ! To eat my heart out , I guess ! To be made a fool of by women ! The whole beastly world is a lie and women are the biggest lie of all ! I 'm sick of it ! . . . Who said people are honest ? " he shouted at Mertyl . " They 're liars and hypocrites ! ... Mert , I think I 'll kill myself . " " You 're talking through your hat , " Mertyl said . " Why should n't I ? What have I got to live for ? What has anyone got ? The wise person kills himself as soon as he begins to think . " " Kill yourself over a woman , I guess . That would be a joke on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm through with women , " he said . He got a volume of Pope and sat to read . He hurled Pope from him and got a volume of Pater . " Mark my words . I 'm through with women , " he said . In a little while he came to this line : For the way to perfection is through a series of disgusts . He pondered these words for almost an hour . Then he rose and took his cap and entered the night.  | HE WAS not through with women . He could no more have lived without women than without air . Morbidly sensitive , and to be , for many years to come , incurably erotic , he saw women as the core of life , with all things swimming in centripetal convolutionsto their center . They drew him irresistibly . They were the gravity of being : he was water , seeking its level . And no more could he remain on the heights , in the polar air of his negations , than water could resist seeking the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him with awful power , was more than women : it was the enormous pulse of creation , with women moving through it as its lovely , its alluring , symbols . It was the huge body of all-that-is , and women swam in it , as fish swim in the sea , and they were the fertile life in its depth , its sensuous color and warmth . And if all women were dead , this uterine pulse would still live , would still pour like fire through the waste of the uncreated . Because , in some form , it was to be seen in every tree and flower , in every field ; and where it was not , there stood the unbeautiful dead . Even when in the classroom , even when walking the streets , Vridar felt this power , this impalpable awakening of the insensate , this reaching through midnight to the sun . In countless things , infinitely small but bright with meaning , he saw its gesture : in the way a girl turned her head , in a man 's sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pausing in their feeble and shifting patterns of thought , theyp293reached down , for a moment , to a depth that lay asleep . And now that spring was coming , he saw all life flowering from its seed . As a matter of fact , when golden days again stood from sky to valley , or lay dreaming on the city 's hills , this thing which possessed him was like an open hunger , like a fire feeding on itself . It rose in gardens of color on the lawns ; it sang in girls like music in violin strings ; and it was a new mightiness , like the sea 's own , in the hearts of men . And books were ignored and all life gathered to the core of April . ' When Vridarentered a classroom , he would see on a blackboard the pathetic symbols of the meaningless . He would see the dead empty chairs and the closed books . For life was building bowers outside , and students walked again in the sorcerous lyricism of shrub and tree . Had Vridar been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfeited with breathing and effort ; where , in every new day , fragrant morning did not drench his senses ; and where not one but a thousand things did not harken back to his youth , recalling , from its great wilderness , all its sweetness of smell and sound , all its passionate question and heartache  --  thenhe might have sat with books on his knees . During the white half-death of winter , he had held his emotions to arm 's length ; but now , with earth pushing out of sleep its acres of garden , and with beauty , like an odorous horn , calling the wanderer to the far journey , he was drawn back , like a vagrant stream , to the mighty current of being and all his paths led to its flood . Early in every morning he rose and walked the streets . Or he left the city and climbed to where the wild flowers grew ; and this earth , which he had cursed , so filled him with longings , reaching to namelessends , and with its deep wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , that he shook in its glory and lay on the ground and wept . No , he was not done with girls . His intelligence , his will , had no power to hold him now . Fear of life held him ; but his hunger rose , surging , like water to a dam ; rose in tides , only to fall back upon itself , to rise and to fall again ; until he was caught in whirlpools of emotion and spun like Seadrift . He sought in books for some strength , some anchor , but he found none . The authors of books , like himself , had been rocked under emotional storms . Like Carlyle , they had been convulsed by negations ; like Swift , they had gone mad under the extravagant blundering of passion ; like Swinburne , they had fled naked before the winds . There was some calm ( and there was much emptiness ) in their pages , but there had been none in their lives . And so , while sitting to his study , Vridar would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life stood near and waited ; and he would lay the books aside . Within him , beat by beat , would rise an ancient and solitary hunger . He would go to the door , having no fixed purpose , and look back into the room ; and he would close the door softly and find the street . He would go into the city , and the ache within him would become feverish and far-reaching . Perhaps he would walk up and down Main Street , staring at persons , wondering how they could be so or he would enter the park . And again and again he went to the Bonneville hall.  |p295quiet  ; or he would stand by a cabaret and listen to its music ; He would peer in or he would walk round and round the place , and then he would go home . But at last , in an April night , he forced himself to enter , and he sat for an hour , trembling in the music ; until , goaded by self-contempt , he went to a woman and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and took his arm . She led him to the floor ; and w hile he slipped and stumbled and burned with shame , the woman talked to him , instructing him in the steps . " See , " she said , smiling up at him . Vridar stared down through mist at her feet . " See ?  --  like this  --  like this . Now you try . " He glanced wildly round him , expecting to see derisive faces . " I  --  I ca n't , " he said . Of course you can . Now watch  --  see , like this . " During the whole of this dance , she lessoned him patiently , wisely ; and Vridar rebuked his clumsiness , his gawkiness , and said he could never dance . And when the dance was done , he intended to flee , but the woman clasped his arm and asked if he wanted to dance with her again . " Again ! " he cried . " Good God , I ca n't dance . " " I 'll learn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All right . But you'n learn if you 'll just try . " Vridar looked at her searchingly . She was not very young . She was not lovely but she was patient and kind.  | " I  --  but  --  " he said . " Well , I mean why should you bother ? " You want to learn , do n't you ? And besides I like you . " " You  --  like me ? " " Yes . " " I do n't know why you should . " " I have reasons . " Dance after dance , during a long evening , the woman spent with him on the floor . She taught him simple movements in the one-step , in the fox-trot , in the waltz . He felt more at ease , fumbled less frequently ; and came at last to be aware of her as a woman in his arms . She was plump and uncorseted . The flesh of her back was warm and alive and her full bosom pressed against his heart ; and yielding , after many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he moved with her in a waltz , through a dream of loveliness , a rhapsody of sex . She patted his shoulder and smiled up at him . She drew him closer . And Vridar stopped , his muscles falling into their old stiffness . " Poof ! " she said . " Come on now , easy , dreamy  --  like this . " He stumbled like a wooden dummy and shrugged . " I guess I ca n't . " His grin was sickly . " Sure you can . Now  --  come on . " He tried again ; and little by little the stiffness left him , he became languorous with the rhythm , he moved again through a dream . When the last dance was done , he looked at the woman . She smiled at him and there was something in her smile , in her eyes , that frightened him.  | " You 'll be a swell dancer soon , " she said . " I hope so . " As she smiled at him now , her eyelids drooped . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " " I  --  well  --  Sure ! " he said . " Tomorrow night ? " " I  --  I guess so . " " Fine . I 'll be your teacher again . And now , Mr. ? " " Hunter . " "  --  Mr. Hunter , if you 'd like to take your teacher home ? " He looked a her . He did n't know what to make of this . It was pretty bold , it seemed to him ; pretty bold , indeed . Lord , he hoped she was not a bad woman ! " That is , if you did n't come with someone . " " No , I did n't . " " If you do n't care to " That is n't it . I  --  I 'd like to . " She took his arm and led him outside . They crossed the street to wait for a car . She asked : " Your people live in Salt Lake ? " " No . " " You here alone ? " " With my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " Again he looked at her . He did not like her mouth . It was not a lovely mouth and he had no wish to kiss it . His gaze lingered for a moment at her breast , and he knew , when she smiled and touched his arm , that she had read his thought . They boarded a car and Vridar dug into his pocket for fare . Then he went down the aisle , looking to right and left , but he did not see her until she smiled . " I thought I 'd lost you , " he said . " You could n't , " she said , and moved close to him . He strove to seem at ease , but he felt as if he were only a great heart , pumping bewilderment . The woman was warm and sleepy now . Once or twice she let her head touch his shoulder , lightly , and when she bent to fasten a shoe , she rested an arm on his knee . He did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ( was n't he , though ! ) , taking a middle-aged woman home . How McClintock would snort if he could see him now ! They went up Main Street and came to the statueof Brigham Young . Vridar looked at the cold stone of the man and thought of two lines he had heard : Oh , I think Brigham Young is a funny old crank , With his rump to the temple and his hand to the bank ! It was quite true . He did have his rump toward the Mormon temple and an arm stretched out to the biggest bank in Zion . And there was a man , Vridar reflected , who got what he wanted . He wanted women , and he had so many wives he could n't remember their first names ; so many children he could n't tell his own from his neighbor 's ; and so much money he could n't calculate its sum . He could sleep with a different woman on every night in the week , and it was this reflection that troubled Vridarp299most . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hike out and take a fresh bride ... . " The scoundrel ! " Vridar thought furiously . And those old codgers in the Bible : they , too , sported among the virgins like a rooster among hens . If the old custom were in vogue now , a weakling like himself , a timid quaking fellow , would have no woman at all . The celibates among the Jews were probably weaklings . They ran in self-pity to the desert and there invoked God 's wrath on kingdoms and prophesiedplagues . Polygamy , he could see , was only anotherinstitution of privilege ... . " This is my stop , " the woman said . Vridar sprang up and went down the aisle . Well , thank heaven , he knew what a man was expected to do : hop off and assist the woman , as if her legs were broken . But upon reaching the front , he found the door closed , and the motorman scowled at him and told him to get off at the rear . Red with shame , he strode down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when he got off , he was shaking with rage . " Such damn cars ! " he cried . " Why do n't they make them all the same ! " " Poof , " said the woman . " It 's all right . " " It is n't ! " he said , glaring at the vanishing trolley . " Nothing in life is like it should be ! " The woman became playful , like an enormous fat kitten . She rebuked him with a finger and gave him a droll wink . " You naughty-naughty man . Life is all right . " " It is n't ! It 's a bag of tricks ! If I could n't make a better world I 'd jump in the sea ! " p 300 " Oh , you savage man ! You scare me . " " The world is a mess ! " he cried , looking furiously around him . " It 's a crime to be born ! " " But not to live after you 're born , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one mighty blow he could raze sun and stars and send God tumbling from His throne . He was in a towering rage but he did n't know at what . He wanted to kill something but there was nothing to lay his hands on ; and again he said : " If I could n't make a better world I 'd jump in the sea ! " They came to the woman 's house and stopped . She looked at him and Vridar looked at her but he could n't tell if she expected to be kissed . He was deliberatingwhen she spoke and her words amazed him . " You just as well come in . My husband is n't here tonight . " " Your husband ! " he gasped . " Good God , you got a husband ! " " Why not ? " She shrugged . " Women usually get a husband , do n't they ? But they do n't always get rid of the louse . " " The louse ! " Vridar cried , dismayed . " You mean  --  you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way I love an automobile . Except I do n't have an automobile . " " I guess you mean , " said Vridar , waxing sardonic , " you like to see him run . . . . Well , why do n't you love him ? " " Do n't be silly . I 've lived with him twelve years . ... Will you come in ? " Vridar took a deep breath.  | " Why  --  " he said . " I mean I should study , I guess . " The woman was very tactful , very wise . She did not urge him . " Some other night , " she said . " We could talk a while . " " Yes , " he assented hastily , " we could . I 'd like to talk . " She smiled as if she understood . She offered a hand . " Goodnight , " she said . " Goodnight . " Vridar watched her enter the house and then went down the street . He wished now he had gone in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluptuous Betty who baked loaves for him , who pressed his face to her bosom and kissed his mouth . He walked round a block , wondering why this woman had asked him in and if she liked him and what she wanted him to do . He returned to the house and saw a light within . Going softly to the porch , he hesitated , and while standing here , he heard the woman singing . She seemed to be very happy and he wondered what she was happy about . He listened to the words of her song . He returned to the walk and listened but she was not singing now . That , he reflected , was rather strange . He went to a corner to meditate but he could not think : his senses were burning and scattered like flame in a wind . The path to her door , it seemed to him , led to light and meaning , and the way home- ward lay across a waste of precepts and death . But he could not be sure and he was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing why , hardly realizing what he did . There were twenty-two hundred and ninety-eight . He thought of the number as he got into bed . He was still thinking of it when he fell asleep. p ON THE next day , the United States declared war . Vridar was neither surprised nor pleased : he felt , indeed , as if he had been walking in a noisome place and had come upon a dead thing . Because war for him was not glamorous adventure . Though a lad still in his emotions , he was a man  --  and in some respects an old man  --  in a few of his thoughts . He had reflectedmuch on war , its causes and waste and slaughter , and he hated it . War , it seemed to him , fed on jungle instincts , on dark and primordial violence ; it turned the brute out of its civilized prison and gave to hungry hands the tools of death . And so there was not in him , as there was in his classmates and professors , a patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or see a greater vision . He did not think with vengeful lust of his enemies ; for he had no enemies , least of all in Germany , and he had no need to fight . Nor did he ever believe , with McClintock and others , that the Germansraped Belgian women or cut the hands off childrenor drove their captives mad . Both the news and the editorials in papers he regarded as a monstrous lie . And his instructors lied , too ; or , more nearly , they and editors were the victims of a national hysteria . And when , in the classroom , Vridar heard his teacher of history fall into turgid abuse of the Germans and expatiate furiously on their militarism and greed , he stared at the man and wondered if he had spent all his years in a cloister . If an educator , a man of sixty who had been president of two universities , could be so silly , so ponderously stupid , then what was the world coming to ! If his professor of English could say , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germansat heart were still wild and savage Norsemen ; if his professor of French could say that until Germany was crushed , with half of it slain and the rest in bondage , there could be no decency on earth ; and if his professor of economics , a quiet inoffensive old gentleman , could declare that Germany 's purpose was the subjugation and serfdom of the world  --  then what was civilization but a feverish blind pilgrimage and what was an educated man but a head-hunter lost to his tribe ? The whole campus was wild with approval . Among the men , there was only one question : When are you going to enlist ? Among the girls there was a new vitality , a strange eagerness : the old dark spirit of the war-dance was in their gestures and speech . In them , and in the men , old and young , there awoke a sunken heritage of the ancient . The women heard the tom-toms ; they saw the male , armed with noose and war-club , preparing for the chase ; and they smelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , deeper and more eternal , than sororities and gowns and teas . And in this atmosphere , electric with the jungle , Vridar felt lost . There was perhaps none here more emotional than himself ; none whose common days were more tumultuous and hot-headed ; but when he fought , he wanted to lay his life down in a decent cause . He would have fought to slay any man who exploited his race , but not the man conscripted by the exploiter . He would have fought to slay religiousp305bigots or drug peddlers or pimps ; but he would not kill a German whom he had never seen , or enlist in a cause that would be , as nearly all wars had been , a colossal butchery in the name of God . The French Revolution was a decent struggle : he would have fought in that . But the American war for freedom , wise and generous in its origins , became a grasping political gang-fight . And the Spanish-American War was so appallingly selfish , so bullying , and it stunk so o f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . . . . McClintock had a different opinion . " You 're a hell of an American ! " he cried . " You got a-defend your country ! " " Against what ? " Vridar asked . " The Huns ! The barbarians ! The rapers of womenand the butchers of babes ! " " That 's newspaper mush . " " It 's the truth . Listen , you ought a-be stuck in jail . You ought a-be deported . " " If there was a sensible country on earth , " Vridar said , " I 'd go to it if I could . " " Then go ! Get out ! You 're no decent citizen . " McClintock was in a fine patriotic rage . Heswore in the name of God and the flag and the mothersof men . " You going to enlist ? " Vridar asked . " Sure . And watch me shoot the sons-of-bitches when I get over there ! I 'll shove a bayonet in their guts and twist it off ! " " Why ? What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why -- for justice ! For the honor of women . For the right of a baby to live and breathe . "
