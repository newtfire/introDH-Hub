CHAPTER I An Empty Room The house where the long trail started was one of gray walls , gray rooms and gray corridors , with carpets that muffled the feet which at intervals passed along them . It was a house of silence , brooding within the high fence that shut it and the grounds from a landscape torpid under the hot sun of summer , and across which occasionally drifted the lonely , mournful whistle of a train on a nearby railroad . Inside the house there was always a hush , a heavy quiet -- restful to the brain . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in one of the gray-walled rooms . " Yes , I rang for you . I want my bags packed . I 'm leaving this minute ! " The face of the man who had entered showed surprise . " Leaving , Mr. Torrance ? Why ? " " Read this ! " Illustration : She was fastened in the mud of the gloomy sea-floor . As if , knowing and therefore dreading what he would see , the attendant took the newspaper held outstretched to him and followed the pointing finger to a featured column . He scanned it : Deadline Passed for Missing Submarine Point Barrow , Aug. 17 ( AP ) : Planes sent out to search for the missing polar submarine Peary have returned without clue to the mystery of is disappearance . The close search that has been conducted through the last two weeks , involving great risks to the pilots , has been fruitless , and authorities now hold out small hope for Captain Sallorsen , his crew and the several scientists who accompanied the daring expedition . If the Peary , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded in the deep silt of the polar sea-floor , her margin of safety has passed the deadline , it was pointed out to-day by her designers . Through special rectifiers aboard , her store of air can be kept capable of sustaining life for a theoretical period of thirty-one days . And exactly thirty-one days have now elapsed since last the Peary 's radio was heard from a position 72 deg. 47 ' N , 162 deg. 22 ' W , some twelve hundred miles from the North Pole itself . In official circles , hope was practically abandoned for the missing submarine , though attempts will continue to be made to locate her .... " I 'm sorry , Mr. Torrance , " said the attendant nervously . " This paper should --  " " Should never have reached me , eh ? Through some slip of the people who censor my reading matter here , I read what I was n't supposed to -- that 's what you mean ? " " It was thought better , Mr. Torrance , by the doctors , and --  " " Good God ! Thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned the men on this submarine to death ! I have n't heard a word about the expedition ; did n't even know the Peary was up there , much less missing ! " " Well , Mr. Torrance , " the attendant stammered , more and more unsettled , " the doctors thought that -- that any news about it would -- well , upset you . " The young man laughed bitterly ; " Bring on my old ' trouble , ' I suppose . The doctors have been considerate , but I wo n't concern them any more . I 'm through . I 'm leaving for the north -- right now . There 's a bare chance I might still be in time . " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Torrance , but you ca n't . " " Ca n't ? " The attendant had retreated to the door . His eyes were nervous , his face pale . " It 's orders , Mr. Torrance . You 've been under observation treatment , and the doctors left strict orders that you must stay . " The young man throbbed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out , in a last attempt at reason : " But do n't you see , I 've got to get to the Peary ! It 's the last hope for those men ! The position she was last heard from is right where I --  " " You ca n't leave , Mr. Torrance ! I 'm sorry , but I 'll have to call a guard ! " For a minute their eyes held . With an effort , the young man said more calmly : " I see . I see . I 'm a prisoner . All right , leave me . " The attendant was more than willing . The young man heard the door 's lock click . And then he lowered his head and pressed his hands hard into his face . But a second later he was looking up again , at the single wide window which gave out on the lonely landscape over which sometimes came drifting the distant cry of a train 's whistle . * * * * * Two months before , Kenneth Torrance had returned to the whaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a confused story of men who were half-seals that lived in mounds under the Arctic ice , 1 who had captured him and -- he found -- had also captured the second torpooner , Chanley Beddoes . In breaking free from their mound-prison , Beddoes had killed one of the sealmen and had been himself slain minutes later by a killer whale , one of the fierce scavengers of the sea which the sealmen trapped for food even as the Narwhal sought them for oil . Ken Torrance alone came back . Footnote 1 : See the February , 1932 , issue of Astounding Stories . Over their doubts , he had stuck to his story . Later , he had repeated it to officials of the Alaska Whaling Company , who worked the submarine and several surface ships . They in return had sent him to a private sanitarium in the State of Washington for a rest which they hoped would " iron out the kink " in his brain . Here Ken had been for six weeks , while the exploring submarine Peary nosed her way northward toward the Pole . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummed with reports of the Peary 's disappearance in that far-off ever-shrouded sea of mystery . She might , Ken knew , have struck a shaft of underwater ice , sending her to the bottom ; some of her machinery might have cracked up , paralyzing her ; the ice-fields under which she cruised might have shifted suddenly , crushing her ribs -- of these perils the world knew as well as he . But the submarine 's crew was prepared for them ; the Peary was equipped with a circular saw for cutting up through the ice from beneath , and she carried sea-suits which would allow her men , if she were wrecked on the bottom , to leave her and get up on the ice and wait for the first searching plane . Why , then , had not the planes which scoured the region found the survivors ? That was the mystery -- but not to Ken Torrance . There was another peril , of which he alone knew . Not far from where the Peary 's last radio report had come , a group of hollowed-out mounds lay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were -- men who , like the seals , had gone back to the sea . Months ago , Second Torpooner Chanley Beddoes had killed one of them . They were intelligent ; they could remember ; they were capable of hate and fear ; they would be desirous of leveling the debt ! There , Ken felt sure , lay the reason for the Peary 's baffling silence , for the non-appearance of her men . There might still be time . No one of course would listen to him and believe , so he would have to go in search of the Peary and her crew himself . Standing by the window , Kenneth Torrance quickly planned the several steps which would take him to the Arctic and its silent ice-coated sea . And when , some two hours later , after a short warning rap on the door , the individual who served as Mr. Torrance 's attendant entered his room , he was confronted , not by the gentleman whose dinner he carried , but by an empty room , a stripped bed , an open window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground two stories beneath . That was at seven o'clock in the evening . CHAPTER II The Crash At a few minutes before eight o'clock , Air Mail Pilot Steve Chapman was enjoying a quiet cigarette while waiting for the mechanics to warm up the five hundred horses of his mail plane satisfactorily . Halfway through , he heard , from behind , a quick patter of feet , and , turning , he observed a figure clad in flannel trousers and sweater . The cigarette dropped right out of his mouth as he cried : " Ken ! Ken Torrance ! " " Thank God you 're here ! " said Kenneth Torrance . " I gambled on it . Steve , I 've got to borrow your own personal plane . " " What ? " gasped Steve Chapman . " What -- what --  ? " " Listen , Steve . I have n't been with the whaling company lately ; been resting , down here -- secluded . Did n't know that submarine , the Peary , was missing . I just learned . And I know damned well what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , quick is I can , and I 've got to have a plane . " Steve Chapman said rather faintly : " But -- where was the Peary when they last heard from her ? " " Some twelve hundred miles from the Pole . " " And you want to get there in a plane ? From here ? " " Must ! " " Boy , you stand about one chance in twenty ! " " Have to take it . Time 's precious , Steve . I 've got to stop in at the Alaska Whaling Company 's outpost at Point Christensen , then right on up . I ca n't even begin unless I have a plane . You 've got to help me on my one chance of bringing the Peary 's men out alive ! You 'll probably never see the plane again , Steve , but --  " " To hell with the plane , if you come through with yourself and those men , " said the pilot . " All right , kid , I do n't get it all , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . " He led Ken to a hangar wherein stood a trim five-passenger amphibian ; and very soon that amphibian was roaring out her deep-throated song of power on the line , itching for the air , and Steve Chapman was shouting a few last words up to the muffled figure in the enclosed control cockpit . " Fuel 'll last around forty hours , " he finished . " You 'll find two hundred per , easy , and twenty-five hours should take you clear to Point Christensen . I put gun and maps in the right pocket ; food in that flap behind you . Go to it , Ken ! " Ken Torrance gripped the hand outstretched to his and held it tight . He could say nothing , could only nod -- this was a real friend . He gave the ship the gun . Her mighty Diesel bellowed , lashed the air down and under ; the amphibian spun her retractable wheels over the straight hard ground until they lifted lightly and tilted upward in a slow climb for altitude . With fiery streams from the exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north . " Well , " murmured Steve Chapman , " I 've got her instalments left , anyway ! " And he grinned and turned to the mail . * * * * * That night passed slowly by ; and the next day ; and all through night and day the steady roar of beating cylinders hung in Kenneth Torrance 's ears . At last came Point Christensen and a descent ; sleep and then quick , decisive action ; and again the amphibian rose , heavily loaded now , and droned on toward the ice and the cold bleak skies of the far north . On , ever on , until Point Barrow , Alaska 's northernmost spur , was left behind to the east , and the world was one of drifting ice on gray water . Muscles cramped , mind dulled by the everlasting roar , head aching and weary , Ken held the amphibian to her steady course , until a sudden wind shook her momentarily from it . A rising wind . The skies were ugly . And then he remembered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was brewing . They 'd told him that he was heading into disaster ; and their surprised , rather fearful faces appeared before him again , as he had seen them just before taking off , after he had told them where he was going . Of course they 'd thought him crazy . He had brought the amphibian down in the little harbor off the whaling company 's base , gone ashore and greeted his old friends . There was only a handful of men stationed there ; the Narwhal was being overhauled in a shipyard at San Francisco , and it was n't the season for surface whalers . They knew that he , Ken , had been put in a sanitarium ; all of them had heard his wild story about sealmen . But he concocted a plausible yarn to account for his arrival , and they had fed him and given him a berth in the bunkhouse for the night . For the night ! Ken Torrance grinned as he recalled the scene . In the middle of the night he had risen , quickly awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced them to take a torpoon from the outpost 's storehouse and put it inside the amphibian 's passenger compartment . It was robbery , and of course they 'd thought him insane , but they did n't dare cross him . He had told them cheerfully he was going after the Peary , and that if they wanted the torpoon back they were to direct the searching planes to keep their eyes on the place where the submarine was last heard from .... * * * * * Ken came back to the present abruptly as the plane lurched . The wind was getting nasty . At least he did not have much farther to go ; an hour 's flying time would take him to his goal , where he must descend into the water to continue his search . His search ! Had it been , he wondered , a useless one from the start ? Had the submarine 's crew been killed before he 'd even read of her disappearance ? If the sealmen got them , would they destroy them immediately ? " I doubt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept prisoners in one of those mounds , like I was . That is , if they have n't killed any of the creatures . It hangs on that ! " An hour 's time , he had reckoned ; but it was more than an hour . For soon the world was blotted out by a howling dervish of wind and driven snow that time and time again snatched the amphibian from Ken 's control and hurled it high , or threw it down like a toy toward the inferno of sea and ice he knew lay beneath . He fought for altitude , for direction , pitched from side to side , tumbled forward and back , gaining a few hundred feet only to feel them plucked breathtakingly out from under him as the screaming wind played with him . Now and again he snatched a glance at the torpoon behind . The gleaming , twelve-foot , cigar-shaped craft , with its directional rudders , propeller , vision-plate and nitro-shell gun lay safely secured in the passenger compartment , a familiar and reassuring sight to Ken , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for years in the chase for killer whales . Soon , it seemed , he would have to depend on it for his life . For all the Diesel 's power , it was not enough to cope with the dead weight of ice which was forming over the plane 's wings and fuselage . He could not keep the altimeter up . However he fought , Ken saw that finger drop down , down -- up a trifle , quivering as the racked plane quivered -- and then down and down some more . He saw that the plane was doomed . He would have to abandon it -- in the torpoon -- if he could . He was some thirty miles from his objective . The sea beneath would be half hidden under ragged , drifting floes . In fair weather he could have chosen a landing space of clear water , but now he could not choose . The altitude dial said that the water was three hundred feet beneath , and rapidly rising nearer . A margin of seconds in which to prepare ! Ken locked the controls and scrambled back into the passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the torpoon 's entrance port and slid in ; quickly he locked the port and strapped the inner body harness around him ; and then he waited . Now it was all chance . If the plane crashed into clear water , he was safe ; but if she hit ice .... He put that thought from him . The locked controls held the amphibian for perhaps thirty seconds . Then with a scream the storm-giant took her . A mad up-current of wind hurled her high , whirled her dizzily , toyed with her -- and then she spun and dove . Down , down , down ; down with a speed so wild Ken grew faint ; down through the core of a maelstrom of snow till she crashed . Kenneth Torrance knew a sudden shaking impact ; for an instant there was uncertainty ; and then came all-pervading quiet .... CHAPTER III . The Fate of the Peary Quiet , and utter , liquid darkness . Liquid ! Around him , Ken heard a gurgling , at first loud and close , then subsiding to a low whispering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant was the shriek and fury of the storm and in its place the calm , slow-heaving silence of underwater . The plane was shattered in a dozen places , but the torpoon had easily stood it . Ken turned to action . He switched on the torpoon 's dashboard lights and twin bow-beams , and saw that the shell was wedged in the fuselage . The plane was apparently entirely under the surface , and her interior filled with water . Holding the propeller in neutral , he revved up the powerful electric motor . Then he bit the propeller in , slowly . The torpoon nudged back for inches . Then , throwing the gear into forward , Ken gave her full speed . The torpoon leaped ahead , crunched through the weakened corner ahead and was free . It was a world of drab tones that she came into . Down below was impenetrable blackness , shading softly overhead into blue-gray which was mottled by lighter areas from breaks in the floes above . All was calm . There was no sign of life save for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a fish or seaweed . Placid always , would be this shrouded sea of mystery , no matter what furious tempest raged above over the flat leagues of ice and water . But the seeming peacefulness was but a mask for danger . Kenneth Torrance 's face was set in sober lines as he sped the slim torpoon northward , her bow lights shafting long white fingers before her . For now there was only one path -- and that lay ahead . He could not turn back . Storm and water had destroyed the plane that could take him back to land . He could not possibly reach any outpost of civilization in the torpoon , for her cruising radius was only twenty hours . He had planned to land the amphibian on the ice above the spot where the Peary had disappeared , then find a break in the ice and slide down below in the torpoon on his quest -- to return to the plane if it proved fruitless . But now there was no retreat . It was succeed , or die . And with that realization a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the whaling company and the sanitarium , thought him a little crazy . And , since lunatics are always convinced of the reality of their visions , what if the sealmen -- his adventure amidst them -- had been but a dream , a nightmare , an hallucination ? What if he were in truth crazy ? The fear grew rapidly . What if he were ? God ! He , hunting for the Peary , when all those planes and men had failed ! He , expecting to achieve what those searchers , with far greater resources , had not been able to ! Did not that give evidence that his mind was twisted ? Creatures , half-seal , half-men , living under the ice -- it certainly seemed a lunatic 's obsession . Then something within him rose and fought back . " No ! " he cried aloud . " I 'll go bugs if I think like that ! Those sealmen were real -- and I know where they are . I 'm going on ! " And , an hour later , the dashboard 's shaded dials told him he was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * Here was the real Arctic , the real polar sea . No sun , no breath of the world above could reach it through its eternal mask of solid ice . As one of the few unfamiliar aspects of the earth , it was as far removed from the imagination of man as if it were part of a far planet hung spinning millions of miles out in space . Men could reach it in shells of metal , but it was not meant for him , and was always hostile . A dozen times a daring one could cross safely its cold lonely reaches , but the thirteenth time it would snare and destroy him for the unwanted trespasser he was . It was here that the Peary had stepped off into mystery . At this point her hull had throbbed with air , movement , life ; at this point all had been well . And then , minutes or hours later , close to here , the sea devil had sprung . What had happened ? What had trapped her ? What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifold safety devices from even reaching and climbing up on the ice above to signal the searching planes ? Ken Torrance , oppressively alone in the hovering torpoon , gazed through its vision-plate of fused quartz around him . Gray sea , filtering to black beneath ; distant eerie shadows , probably meaning nothing , but possibly all important ; ceiling of thick ice above , rough and in places broken by a sharp down-thrusting spur -- these were his surroundings . These were what he must hunt through , until he came upon the crumpled remnant of a submarine , or the murky , rounded hillocks which gave habitation to the creatures he suspected of capturing that submarine 's crew . * * * * * He began the search systematically . He angled the torpoon down to a position halfway between sea-floor and ice-ceiling , then swung her in an ever-widening circle . Soon his orbit had a diameter of a half-mile ; then a mile ; then two . The torpoon slipped through the water at full speed , her light-beams like restless antennae , now stabbing to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throw into blinding white relief a school of half-transparent fish which scurried with frantic wrigglings of tails from the glare , now slanting up to bathe the cold glassy face of an inverted ice-hill , now down to dig two white holes in the deeper gloom . Ken continued this routine for hours . Steadily and low the electric motor droned in the ears of the watchful pilot , and the stubby propeller 's blades flashed round in a blur of speed between the slightly slanted rudders . Somewhere , miles away , a splintered amphibian plane was slipping down to her last landing , and above , perhaps , the white hell of storm which had brought her low still bowled over the trackless wastes ; but here were only shadows and shifting gloom , straining the alert eyes to soreness and tensing the watcher 's brain with alarms that , one after another , were only false . Until at last he found her . Immediately he shut off all his lights . He no longer needed them . Far in the distance , and below , wavered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could mean only one thing -- the lights of a submarine . And lights meant life ! There would be none burning in a deserted submarine . His heart beat fast and his tight , sober lips widened in a quick grin . He had found the Peary ! And found her with some life still aboard her ! He was in time ! So Ken rejoiced while he slid the torpoon down to a level just a few feet above the silty sea bottom , reducing her to quarter-speed . There was an urge inside him to switch on his bow-beams , reach them out toward the submarine 's hull to tell all within that help was at last at hand ; he wanted to send the torpoon ahead at full speed . But caution restrained him to a more deliberate course . He was in the realm of the sealmen , and he did not wish to attract the attention of any . So he advanced like a furtive shadow slinking along the dark sea-bottom , deep in the covering gloom . Nearer and nearer , while the distant blur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-trapped men , while the consciousness that he had succeeded intoxicated him . He alone had found them ! Sealmen or no sealmen , he had found the Peary ! And found her with lights lit and life inside ! Nearer and nearer .... And then suddenly Ken halted the torpoon and stared with wide , alarmed eyes . For the submarine was now plainly visible in detail -- and he saw her real plight and with it knew the answer to the mystery of her long silence and the non-appearance of her men on the ice field above . * * * * * The Peary was a spectacle of fantastic beauty . It was as if a huge , rounded piece of amber , mellow , golden , lay in the murk of the sea-floor . Not steel , hard and grim , but of transparent , shimmering stuff she was built , all coated a soft yellow by her lights , clearly visible inside . Ken had known something of her radical construction ; knew that a substance called quarsteel , similar to glass and yet fully as tough as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a perfect vehicle for undersea exploration . Her bow was capped with steel , and her stern , propellers , diving rudders ; her port-locks , for the releasing of torpoons , were also of steel , as were the struts that braced her throughout -- but the rest was quarsteel , glowing and golden as the heart of amber . Beautiful with a wild yet scientific beauty was the Peary , but she was not free . She was trapped . She was fastened to the mud of the gloomy sea-floor . Ropes held her down ; and Ken Torrance knew those ropes of old . They were tough and strong , woven of many strands of seaweed , and twenty or thirty of them striped the Peary 's two hundred feet of hull . Unevenly spaced , stretched clear over the ship from one side to the other , they were caught around her up-jutting conning tower , fastened through her rudders , and holding tight in a score of places . They held the submarine down despite all the buoyancy of her emptied tanks and the power of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * Restless dark shadows against the golden hull , they wavered and darted and poised , totally unafraid . Another in Kenneth Torrance 's place would have put them down as some strange school of large seals , inordinately curious but nothing more ; but the torpooner knew them as men -- men remodeled into the shape of seals ; men who , ages ago , had forsaken the land for the old home of all life , the sea ; who , through the years , had gradually changed in appearance as their flesh had become coated with layers of cold-resisting blubber ; whose movements had become adapted to the water ; whose legs and arms had evolved into flippers ; but whose heads still harbored the now faint spark of intelligence that marked them definitely as men . Emotions similar to man 's they had , though dulled ; friendliness , curiosity , anger , hate , and -- Ken knew and feared -- even a capacity for vengeance . Vengeance ! An eye for an eye , tooth for a tooth -- the old law peculiar to man ! Chanley Beddoes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew had not killed more ! If only that , there might be hope ! First he must get inside the submarine . Warily , like a stalking cat , Ken Torrance inched the torpoon toward the great shining ship . At least he was in time . Within her he could see figures , most of them stretched out on the decks of her different compartments , but one of whom occasionally moved -- slowly . He understood that . For weeks now the Peary had lain captive , and her air had passed beyond the aid of rectifiers . Tortured , those survivors inside were , constantly struggling for life , with vitality ever sinking lower . Some might already be dead . But at least he could try to save the rest . He approached her from one side of the rear , for in the rear compartment were her two torpoon port-locks . The one on his side was empty , its outer door open . The torpoon it had held had been sent out , probably for help , and had not returned . It provided a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the port-lock , Ken halted again . His slim craft was almost indistinguishable in the murk : he felt reasonably safe from discovery . For minutes he watched the swimming sealmen , waiting for the best chance to dart in. * * * * * It was then , while studying the full length of the submarine more closely , that he saw that one compartment of her four was filled with water . Her steel-caped bow had been stove in . That , he conjectured , had been the original accident which had brought her down . It was not a fatal accident in itself , for there were three other compartments , all separated by watertight bulkheads , and the flooded one could be repaired by men in sea-suits -- but then the sealmen had come and roped her down where she lay . Some of the creatures , he saw , were actually at that time inside the bow compartment , swimming around curiously amidst the clustered pipes , wheels and levers . It was a weird sight , and one that held his eyes fascinated . But suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neck . A lithe , sinuous shadow close ahead was wavering , and large , placid brown eyes were staring at him . A sealman ! He was discovered ! And instinctively , immediately , Ken Torrence brought the torpoon 's accelerator down flat . The shell jumped ahead with whirling propeller . The creature that had seen him doubled around and sped in retreat . In brief snatches , as the torpoon streaked across the hundred-foot gap to the empty port-lock , Ken glimpsed his discoverer gathering a group of its fellows , and saw brown-skinned bodies swarm after him with nooses of seaweed-rope -- and then the great transparent side wall of the Peary was before him , and the port-locks dark opening . Ken threw his motor into reverse , slid the torpoon slightly to one side , and there was a jerk , a jar , and a sensation of something moving behind . He turned to see the port-lock 's outer door closing , activated by controls inside the submarine -- and just in time to shut out the first of his pursuers . Then the port-lock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inner door clicked and opened . Kenneth Torrance climbed stiffly from the torpoon to enter the interior of the long-lost and besieged exploring submarine Peary . CHAPTER IV " No Chance Left " His entrance was an unpleasant experience . He had forgotten the condition of the air inside the submarine , and what its effect on him , coming straight from comparatively good and fresh air , would be , until he was seized by a sudden choking grip around his throat . He reeled and gasped , and was for a minute nauseated . Lights flashed around him , and teetering backward he leaned weakly , against some metal object until gradually his head cleared ; but his lungs remained tortured , and his breathing a thing of quick , agonised gulps . Then came sounds . Figures appeared before him . " From where --  " " Who are you ? " " What -- what -- what --  " " How did you ? " The half-coherent questions were couched in whispers . The men around him were blear-eyed and haggard-faced , their skins dry and bluish , and not a one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breathing , they were -- but breathing grotesquely , horribly . They made awful noises at it ; they panted , in quick , shallow sucks . Some lay on the deck at his feet , outstretched without energy enough to attempt to rise . Beautiful and slumber-like the submarine had appeared from outside , but inside that effect was lost . There were the usual appurtenances : a maze of pipes , wheels , machinery , all silent now , and cold ; here were the two port-locks for torpoons ; the emergency steering controls ; the small staterooms of the Peary 's officers . Looking forward , still striving for complete clear-headedness and normality , Ken could see the two intact forward compartments , silent and apparently lifeless , with dim lamps burning . They ended with the watertight bulkhead which stood between them and the flooded bow compartment . Ken at last found words , but even his short query cost a sickening effort . " Where's -- the commander ? " he asked . * * * * * A man turned from where he had been leaning against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His tall body was stooped , and the skin of his ruggedly cut face drawn and parchment-like . His face had once been dignified and authoritative , but now it was that of a man who nears death after a long , bitter fight for life . The smile which he gave to Ken was painful -- a mockery . " I am , " he said faintly . " Sallorsen . Just wait , please . A minute . I worked port-lock . Breath 's gone .... " He sucked shallowly for air and let his smile go . And standing there , beside him , gazing at the worn frame , Ken felt strength come back . He had just entered ; this man and the others had been here for weeks ! " I 'm Sallorsen , " the captain went on at last . All his words were clipped off , to cost minimum effort . " Glad you got through . Afraid you 're come to prison , though . " " No ! " Ken said emphatically . He spoke to the captain , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " No , Captain ! I 'm Kenneth Torrance . Once torpooner with Alaska Whaling Company . They thought me crazy -- crazy -- 'cause I told about sealmen . Put me in sanitarium . I knew they had you -- when -- heard you were missing . " He pointed at the brown-skinned creatures that clustered close around the submarine outside her transparent walls . " I got free and came . Just in time . " " In time ? For what ? " Another voice gasped out the question . Ken turned to a broad-shouldered man with a ragged growth of beard that had been a trim Van Dyke ; and before the torpooner could answer , Sallorsen said : " Dr. Lawson . One of our scientists . In time for what ? " " To get you and the submarine free , " said Ken . " How ? " * * * * * Ken paused before replying . He gazed around -- out the side walls of glistening quarsteel into the sea gloom , into the thick of the smooth , lithe , brown-skinned shapes that now and again poised pressing against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Dimly he could see the taut seaweed ropes stretching down from the top of the Peary to the sea-bottom . It looked hopeless , and to these men inside it was hopeless . He knew he must speak in confident , assured tones to drive away the uncaring lethargy holding them all , and he framed definite , concise words with which to do it . " These creatures have caught you , " he began , " and you think they want to kill you . But look at them . They seem to be seals . They 're not . They 're men ! Not men like us -- half-men -- sealmen , rather -- changed into present form by ages of living in the water . I know . I was captured by them once . They 're not senseless brutes ; they have a streak of man 's intelligence . We must communicate with that intelligence . Must reason with them . I did once . I can do it again . " They 're not really hostile . They 're naturally peaceful ; friendly . But my friend -- dead now -- killed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us enemies . That 's why they trapped your sub . " They think you 're enemies ; think you want to kill them . But I 'll tell them -- through pictures , as I did once before -- that you mean them no harm . I 'll tell them you 're dying and must have air -- just as they must . I 'll tell them to release submarine and we 'll go away and not disturb them again . Above all I must get across that you wish them no harm . They 'll listen to what my pictures will say -- and let us go -- 'cause at heart they 're friendly ! " * * * * * He paused -- and with a ghastly , twisted smile , Captain Sallorsen whispered : " The hell you say ! " His sardonic comment brought a sudden chill to Kenneth Torrance . He feared one thing that would render his whole value useless . He asked quickly : " What have you done ? " " Those seals , " Sallorsen 's labored voice continued "  - -  they 've killed eight of us . Now they 're killing all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Breathless , Ken waited for the answer be feared . " Yes . Two . " The men were all staring at Ken , so he had to hide the awful dejection which clamped his heart . He only said : " That 's what I feared . It changes everything . No use trying to reason with them now . " He fell silent . " Well , " he said at last , trying to appear more cheerful , " tell me what happened . Maybe there 's something you 've overlooked . " " Yes , " Sallorsen whispered . He started to come forward to the torpooner , but stumbled and would have fallen had not Ken caught him in time . He put one of the captain 's arms around his shoulder , and one of his own around the man 's waist . " Thanks , " Sallorsen said wryly . " Walk forward . Show you what happened . " * * * * * There were men in the second compartment , and they still fought to live . From the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breathing even more torturous than that of the men in the rear . In the single bulb 's dim light Ken could see their shapes stretched motionlessly out , panting and panting . Occasionally hands reached up to claw at straining necks , as if to try and rid throats of strangling grasps . Two figures had won free from the long struggle . They lay silent and still , the outline of their dead bodies showing through the sheets pulled over them . Slowly Sallorsen led Ken through this compartment and into the next , which was bare of men . Here were the ship 's main controls -- her helm , her central multitude of dials , levers and wheels , her televisiscreen and old-fashioned emergency periscope . A metal labyrinth it was , all long silent and inactive . Again the weird contrast struck Ken , for outside he could still see the scene of vigorous , curious life that the sealmen constituted . Close they came to the submarine 's sheer walls of quarsteel , peering in stolidly , then flashing away with an effortless thrust of flippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . Like men , the sealmen needed air to live , and got it fresh and clean from the world above . Inside , real men were gasping , fighting , hopelessly , yielding slowly to the invisible death that lay in the poisonous stuff they had to breathe .... Ken felt Sallorsen nudge him . They had come to the forward end of the control compartment , and could go no farther . Before them was the watertight door , in which was set a large pane of quarsteel . The captain wanted him to look through . Ken did so , knowing what to expect ; but even so he was surprised by the strangeness of the scene . In among the manifold devices of the front compartment , its wheels and pipes and levers , glided slowly the sleek , blubbery shapes of half a dozen sealmen . Back and forth they swam , inspecting everything curiously , unhurried and unafraid ; and as Ken stared one of them came right up to the other side of the closed watertight door , pressed close to the pane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered through a jagged rip in the plates on the starboard side of the bow . At this Sallorsen began to speak again in the short , clipped sentences , punctuated by quick gasps for air . * * * * * " Crashed , bow-on , " he said . " Underwater ice . Outer and inner plates crumpled like paper . Lost trim and hit bottom . Got this door closed , but lost four men in bow compartment . Drowned . No chance . Sparks among ' em , at his radio . That 's why we could n't radio for help . " He paused , gasping shallowly . " Could 've got away if we 'd left immediately . One flooded compartment not enough to hold this ship down . But I did n't know . I sent two men out in sea-suits -- inspect damage . Those devils got them . " The seal-things came in a swarm . God ! Fast ! We did n't realize . They had ropes , and in seconds they 'd lashed us down to the sea-floor . Lashed us fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , and Ken Torrance did not try to hurry him , but stood silent , looking forward to the squashed bow , and out the sides to where he could see the taut black lines of the seaweed-ropes . " The two men put up fight . Had crowbars . Useless -- but they killed one of the devils . That did it . They were torn apart in front of us . Ripped . Mangled . By spears the things carry . Dead like that . " " Yes , " murmured Ken , " that would do it .... " " I quick tried to get away , " gasped Sallorsen . " Full-speed -- back and forth . No good . Ropes held . Could n't break . All our power could n't ! So then -- then I acted foolishly . Damn foolish . But we were all a little crazy . A nightmare , you know . Could n't believe our eyes -- those seals outside , mocking us . So I called for volunteers . Four men . Put ' em in sea-suits , gave ' em shears and grappling prongs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd soon have us free ! Oh , God ! " It seemed he could not go on , but he forced the words out deliberately . " Killed without a chance ! Ripped apart like the others ! No chance ! Suicide ! " Ken felt the agony in the man , and was silent for a while before quietly asking : " Did they kill any more of the sealmen ? " " One . Just one . That made two of them -- six of us . What the hell are the rest of them waiting for ? " Sallorsen cried . " They killed eight in all ! To our two ! That 's enough for them , is n't it ? " " I 'm afraid not , " said Ken Torrance . " Well , what then ? " " Sat down and thought . Carefully . Hit on a plan . Took one of our two torpoons . Lashed on it steel plates , ground to sharp cutting edges . Spent days at it . Thought torpoon could go out and cut the ropes . Haines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They got the torpoon ? " Ken asked . Sallorsen 's arm raised in a pointing gesture . " Look . " * * * * * Some fifty feet away from the Peary , on the side opposite to the one Ken Torrance had approached , a dimly discernible object lay in the mud . In miniature , it resembled the submarine : a cigar-shaped steel shell , held down to the sea-bottom by ropes bound over it . Cutting edges of steel had been fastened along its length . " I see , " said Ken slowly . " And its pilot ? " " Stayed in the torpoon thirty-six hours . Then went crazy . Put on sea-suit and tried to get back here . Whisk -- they got him . Killed and mangled while we watched ! " " But did n't his torpoon have a nitro-shell gun ? Could n't he have fought them off for a time ? " " Exploring submarine , this ! No guns in torpoons like whalers . Gun would n't help , anyway . These devils too fast . No use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulkhead , his lips moving but no sound coming forth . Dully he stared ahead , through the submarine , for a moment before uttering a cackling mockery of a laugh and going on . " Even after that , still hoped ! Blew every tank on ship ; blew out most of her oil . Threw out everything not vital . Lightened her as much as could . Machinery -- detachable **45;123;TOOLONG , plates , cups -- everything ! She rose a couple of feet -- no more ! Put motors at full speed -- back and forth -- again , again , again . Buoyancy -- power -- no good . No damn good ! " And then we tried the last chance . Explosives . Had quite a store , Nitromite , packed in cases ; time-fuses to set it off . Had it for blasting ice . I sent up a charge and blew hole in the ice overhead , for our other torpoon . " Nothing else left . Knew planes must be nearby , searching . Last torpoon was to shoot up to the hole -- pilot to climb on ice and stay there to signal a plane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Sallorsen cackled again . " It was roped like the other . Pilot tried to get back , but they got him like first . There 's the torpoon -- out ahead . " Ken could just make it out . It lay ahead , slightly to port , lashed down like its fellow by seaweed-ropes . His eyes were held by it , even when Sallorsen continued , in an almost hysterical voice : " Since then -- since then -- you know . Week after week . Air getting worse . Rectifiers running down . No night , no day . Just the lights , and those damned devils outside . Wore sea-suits for a while ; used twenty-nine of their thirty hours air-units . Old Professor Halloway died , and another man . Could n't do anything for ' em . Just sit and watch . Head aching , throat choking -- God ! ... " Some of the men went mad . Tried to break out . Had to show gun . Quick death outside . Here , slow death , but always the chance that -- Chance , hell ! There 's no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those things outside , watching , watching , waiting -- waiting for us to leave -- waiting to get us all ! Waiting .... " " Something 's up ! " said Ken Torrance suddenly . " They 've got tired of waiting ! " CHAPTER V The Last Assault Sallorsen turned his head and followed the torpooner 's intent , amazed gaze . Ken said : " There 's proof of their intelligence ! I 've been watching -- did n't realize at first . Look , here it comes ! " Several sealmen , while Sallorsen had been talking , had come dropping down from the main mass of the horde , and had grouped around the abandoned torpoon which lay some feet ahead of the submarine 's bow . Expertly they had loosened the seaweed-ropes which bound it to the sea-floor , then slid back , watching alertly , as if expecting the torpoon to speed away of its own accord . Its batteries , of course , had worn out weeks before , so the steel shell did net budge . The sealmen came down close to it again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipper-arms , and with maneuvering of delicate sureness guided it through the gash in the Peary 's bow . Inside , they hesitated with it , midway between deck and ceiling of the flooded compartment . They poised for perhaps a full minute , judging the distance , while the two men stared ; and then quickly their powerful tail flippers lashed out and the torpoon jumped ahead . It sped straight through the water , to crash its tough nose of steel squarely into the quarsteel pane of the watertight door , then rebounded , and fell to the deck . " My God ! " gasped Sallorsen . But Ken wasted no words then . He pressed closer to the quarsteel and examined it minutely . The substance showed no visible effect , but the action of the sealmen destroyed whatever hope he had felt . The sealmen had swerved aside at the last minute ; and now , picking up the torpoon again and guiding it back to the other end of the compartment , they hurled it once more with a resounding crash into the quarsteel pane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ken asked tersely . Obviously , Sallorsen 's wits were muddled at this turn . He remained gaping at the creatures and at the torpoon , now turned against its mother submarine . Ken repeated the question . " How long ? Who knows ? It 's as strong as steel , but -- there 's the pressure -- and those blows hit one spot . Not -- long. " * * * * * Capping his words , there re-echoed again the loud crash of the torpoon 's on the quarsteel . The sealmen were working in quick routine now ; back and quickly forward , and then the crash and the reverberation ; and again and again .... The ominous crash and ringing echoes regularly repeated , seemed to disorganise Ken 's mind as he looked vainly for something with which to brace the door . Nothing unattached was left -- nothing ! He ran and examined the quarsteel pane again , and this time his brain heated in alarm . A thin line had shot through the quarsteel -- the beginning of a crack . " Back ! " Ken shouted to the still staring Sallorsen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ! " " Yes , " Sallorsen mumbled . " It 'll go . So will the others . They 'll smash them all . And when this is flooded -- no hope of running the submarine again . Controls in here . " " That 's too damned bad ! " Ken said roughly . " Are there any sea-suits , food , supplies in here ? " " Only food . In those lockers . " " I 'll take it . Get into that third compartment -- hear me ? " ordered Kenneth Torrance . " And have its door ready to close ! " He shoved Sallorsen away , opened the indicated lockers and piled his arms with the tins revealed . He had time for no more than one load . He jumped back into the third compartment of the Peary just as a splintering crash sounded from behind . The door between was swung closed and locked just as the one being battered crashed inward . Turning , Ken saw that the torpoon had cracked through the weakened quarsteel and tumbled in a mad cascade of water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , he , with Sallorsen and those of the men who had strength and curiosity enough to come forward , watched the compartment rapidly fill -- watched until they saw the water pressed high against the door . And then horror swept over Ken Torrance . * * * * * Water ! There was a trickle of water down the quarsteel he was leaning against ! A fault along the hinge of the door -- either its construction , or because it had not been closed properly . Ken pointed it out to the captain . " Look ! " he said . " A leak already -- just from the pressure ! This door wo n't last more than a couple of minutes when they start on it --  " Sallorsen stared stupidly . As for the rest ; Ken might not have spoken . They were as if in a trance , watching dumbly , with lungs automatically gasping for air . One of the seal-creatures eeled through the shattered quarsteel of the first door and swam slowly around the newly flooded compartment . At once it was joined by five other lithe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspected the compartment minutely . They came in a group right up to the next door that barred their way and , with no visible emotion , stared through the quarsteel pane at the humans who stared at them . And then they gracefully turned and slid to the battered torpoon . " Back ! " Ken shouted , " You men ! " He shook them , shoved them roughly back toward the fourth , and last , compartment . Weakly , like automatons they shuffled into it . The torpooner said bruskly to Sallorsen : " Carry those tins of food back . Hurry ! Is there anything stored in here we 'll need ? Sallorsen ! Captain ! Is there anything --  " The captain looked at him dully ; then , understanding , a cackle came from his throat . " Do n't need anything . This is the end . Last compartment . Finish ! " " Snap out of it ! " Ken cried . " Come on , Sallorsen -- there 's a chance yet . Is there anything we 'll need in here ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly opened the lockers . Pulling out the bulky suits , he cried : " You carry that food back . Then come and help me. " * * * * * But of the corner of his eye , as he worked , he could see the ominous preparations beyond in the flooded compartment -- the sealmen raising the torpoon , guiding it back to the far end ; leveling it out . Ken was sure the door could not stand more than two or three blows at the most . Two or three minutes , that meant -- but all the sea-suits had to go back into the fourth compartment ! He was in torment as he worked . For him , the conditions were just as bad as for the men who had lived below in the submarine for a month ; the poisonous , foul air racked him just as much ; what breath he got he fought for just as painfully . But in his body was a greater store of strength , and fresher muscles ; and he taxed his body to its very limit . Panting , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled through into the last compartment laden with a pile of sea-suits . He dropped them clattering in a pile around his feet and forced himself back again . Another trip ; and another .... It would never have been done had not Sallorsen and Lawson , the scientist , come to his aid . The help they offered was meager , and slow , but it sufficed . Laden for the fifth time , Ken heard what he had been anticipating for every second of the all too short , agonizing minutes : a sharp , grinding crack , and the following reverberation . He snatched a glance around to see the torpoon falling to the deck of the second compartment -- the sealmen lifting it swiftly again -- and a thin but definite sliver in the quarsteel of the door . But the last suit was gotten into the fourth compartment , and the connecting door closed and carefully locked and bolted . The removal of the suits , had been achieved -- but what now ? Panting , completely exhausted , Ken forced his brain to the question . From every side he attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sought . Everything , it seemed , had been tried , and had failed , during the Peary 's long captivity . There was nothing left . True , he had his torpoon , and its nitro-shell gun with a clip of nineteen shells ; but what use were shells ? Even if each one accounted for one of the sealmen , there would still remain a swarm . And the sea-suits . He had struggled for them and had saved them , but what use could he put them to ? Go out leading a desperate final sally for the hole in the ice above ? Death in minutes ! No hope . Nothing . Not even a fighting chance . These seal-creatures , strange seed of the Arctic ice , had trapped the Peary all too well . On the roll of mysteriously missing ships would her name go down ; and he , Ken Torrance , would be considered a lunatic who had sought suicide , and found it .... * * * * * Of the twenty-one survivors of the Peary 's officers and crew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the sealmen . The rest lay in various attitudes on the deck of the rear compartment , showing no sign of life save torturous , shallow pantings for air and , occasionally , spasmodic clutchings at their throats and chests , as they tried to fight off the deadly , invisible foe that was slowly strangling them . Ken Torrance , Sallorsen , the scientist , Lawson , and a few others were pressed together at the last watertight door , peering through the quarsteel at the sea-creatures ' systematic assault on the door leading into the third compartment . A straight , hard smash at it ; another final splintering smash -- and again the torpoon pushed through in the van of a cascade of icy , greenish water , which quickly claimed the control compartment for the attackers behind . The creatures were growing bolder . More and more of them had entered the submarine , and soon each open compartment was filled from deck to ceiling with the slowly turning , graceful brown bodies , inspecting minutely the countless wheels and levers and gauges , and inspecting also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared with dull eyes at them through the sole remaining door . There was no further retreat , now . Behind was only water and the swarm that passed to and fro through it . Water and sealmen -- ahead , above , to the sides , behind -- everywhere . Cooped in their transparent cell , the crew of the submarine Peary waited the end . * * * * * Once more , as well as he could with his throbbing head and heavy , choking body , Kenneth Torrance tracked over the old road that had brought him nowhere , but was the only road open . Carefully he took stock of everything he had that he might possibly fight with . There were sea-suits for the men , and in each suit an hour 's supply of artificial but invigorating air . Two port-locks , one on each side of the stern compartment . A torpoon , with a gun and nineteen shells . Nothing else ? There seemed to be , in his mind , a vague memory of something else ... something that might possibly be of use ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the agony of slow strangulation he was going through drove everything but the consciousness of pain from his shirking mind . But there was something else -- and perhaps it was the key . Perhaps if he could only remember it -- whatever it was -- whether a tangible thing or merely a passing idea of hours ago -- the way out would be suddenly revealed . But he could not remember . He had the sea-suits , the port-locks and the torpoon : what possible pattern could he weave them into to bring deliverance ? No , there was nothing . Not even a girder that could be unfastened in time to brace the last door . No way of prolonging this last stand ! Beside Ken , the strained , panting voice of Lawson whispered : " Getting ready . Over soon now . All over . " All save five of the sealmen had left the third compartment , to join the swarm constantly swimming around and over the submarine outside . The five remaining were the crew for the battering ram . With measured and deliberate movements they ranged their lithe bodies beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far end of the compartment . There they poised for a minute , while from the men watching sounded a pathetic sigh of anticipation . As one , the five seal-creatures lunged forward with their burden . Crash ! And the following dull reverberation . The last assault had begun . CHAPTER VI In a Biscuit Can Ken Torrance glanced with dull , hopeless eyes over the compartment he stood in . Figures stretched out all over the deck , gasping , panting , strangling -- men waiting in agony for death . His head sank down , and he wiped wet hands across his aching forehead . Nothing to do but wait -- wait for the end -- wait as the patient horde outside had been waiting in the sea-gloom for their moment of triumph , when the soft bodies inside the Peary would be theirs to rip and mangle .... A dragging sound brought Ken 's eyes wearily up and to the side . One of the crew who had been lying on the deck was dragging his body painfully toward a row of lockers at one side of the compartment . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched his progress dully , without thinking , as inch by inch he forced himself through the other bodies sprawled in his way . He saw him reach the lockers , and for a minute , gasping , lie there . He saw a clawing arm stretch almost up to the catch on one locker , while the man whimpered like a child at his lack of quick success . Crash ! The grinding blow of the torpoon hitting the quarsteel clanged out from behind . But Ken 's mind was all on the reaching man 's strange actions . He saw the fingers at last succeed in touching the catch . The door of the locker opened outward , and eagerly the man reached inside and pulled . With a thump , a row of heavy objects strung together rolled out onto the deck -- and Ken Torrance sprang suddenly to the man 's side : " What are you doing ? " he cried . The man looked up sullenly . He mumbled : " Damn fish -- wo n't get me . I 'll blow us all to hell , first ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's nitromite ! " he shouted . " That 's the idea -- the nitromite ! " And stooping down , he wrenched the rope of small black boxes which contained the explosive from the man who had worked so painfully to get them . " I 'll do the blowing , boy ! " he said . " Do n't worry ; I 'll do it complete ! " * * * * * Ken , holding the rope of explosives , crossed the deck and pulled Sallorsen and Lawson around . Their worn faces , with lifeless , bloodshot eyes , met his own strong features , and he said forcefully : " Now listen ! I need your help . I 've found our one last chance for life . We three are the strongest , and we 've got to work like hell . Understand ? " His enthusiasm and the vigor of his words roused them . " Yes , " said Lawson . " What -- we do ? " " You say there 's an hour 's air left in the sea-suits ? " Torrance asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then get the men into the suits , " the torpooner ordered . " Help the weaker ones ; slap them till they obey you ! " There came the ugly , deafening crash of the hurled torpoon into the compartment door . Ken finished grimly : " And for God 's sake , hurry ! I 'll explain later . " Sallorsen and Lawson unquestioningly obeyed . Ken had reached the spirit in them , the strength not physical , that had all but been driven out by the long , hopeless weeks and the poisonous stuff that passed for air , and it had risen and was responding . Sallorsen 's voice , for the first time in days , had his old stern tone of command in it as , calling on everything within him , he shouted : " Men , there 's still a chance ! Everyone into sea-suits ! Quick ! " A few of the blue-skinned figures lying panting on the deck looked up . Fewer moved . They did not at once understand . Only four or five dragged themselves with pathetic eagerness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh air that remained in them . Sallorsen repeated his command . " Hurry ! Men -- you , Hartley and Robson and Carroll -- your suits on ! There 's air in them ! Put ' em on ! " * * * * * And then Lawson was among them , shaking the hopeless , dying forms , rousing them to the chance for life . Several more crawled to obey . By the time the next crash of the torpoon came , eleven out of the twenty-one survivors were working with clumsy , eager fingers at their sea-suits , pushing feet and legs in , drawing the tough fabric up over their bodies , sliding their arms in , and struggling with quick panting breaths to raise the heavy helmets and fasten them into place . Then -- air ! Again the ear-shattering crash . The scientist and the captain drove at the rest of the crew . They stumbled , those two fighting men , and twice Lawson went down in a heap as his legs gave under him ; but he got up again , and they began dragging the suits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoving inert limbs into place , switching on the air-units inside the helmets and , gasping themselves , fastening the helmets down . Theirs was a conflict as cruel , as hard and brutal as men smashing at each other with fists , and they then proved their right to the shining roll of honor , wherever and whatever that roll may be . They fought on past pain , past sickness , past poisoning , that man of action and men of the laboratory . And outside that foul transparent pit the tempo quickened also . The sledging blows at the last door came quicker . All around the captive Peary the sleek brown bodies stirred uneasily . For weeks there had been but little activity inside the submarine ; now , all at once , three of the figures that were men whipped the others into action , rousing those lying dying on the deck -- working , working . Observing this , the lithe seal bodies moved with new nervous , restless strokes , to and fro , never pausing -- passing up and down in a milling stream the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth compartment , where they pressed as close as they could , their wide brown eyes already on the haggard forms that worked inside , their smooth bodies patterned by the constantly shifting shadows of their fellows above and behind . So they watched and waited , while in the third compartment the battered torpoon was slung at the last door , and drawn back , and slung again -- waited for the final moment , the crisis of their month-long siege beneath the floes of the silent Arctic sea ! * * * * * Kenneth Torrance worked by himself . He saw that Sallorsen and Lawson had answered his call ; man after man was clad in his suit and sucking in the incomparably fresher , though artificial , air of the units . As he had hoped , that air was revitalizing the worn-out bodies rapidly , giving them new strength and clearing their brains . His plan required that -- strength for the men to move and act for themselves -- sane heads ! The plan was basically simple . Bringing his best concentration to the all-important details , Ken started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the inner door of the starboard port-lock , wherein lay his torpoon . Opening the entrance panel of the steel shell , he quickly transferred within the cans of compressed food retrieved from the second compartment . When he had finished , there was left barely room for the pilot 's body . And then the nitromite . The explosive was carried by the Peary for the blasting of such ice floes as might trap her . It was contained for chemical stability in a half dozen six-inch-square , water-proof boxes , strung one after another on an interconnecting wired rope . Ken would need them all ; he wished he had five times as many . It would not matter if the whole of the Peary were shattered to slivers . Ken tied the rope of boxes into a strong unit , as small as it could be made . Firing and timing mechanisms were contained in each unit : he would only have to set one of them . He wrapped the whole charge , except for one small corner , in several pieces of the men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed it in an empty tin container for sea-biscuits. * * * * * All this had taken only minutes . But in those minutes the quarsteel of the watertight door had been subjected to half a dozen smashing blows , and already a flaw had appeared in the pane . Another grinding crunch , and there would be the visible beginning of a crack . Three more , perhaps , and the door would be down . But the plan was laid , the counter move ready ; and , as Sallorsen and Lawson , last of them all , got into suits , Ken Torrance , in short , gasping sentences , explained it . " All the nitromite 's in this , " Ken said . " I hope it 's enough . In a moment I 'll set the timing to explode it in one minute -- then eject it from the empty torpoon port-lock . It 's a gamble , but I think the explosion should kill every damned seal around the sub . Water carries such shocks for miles , so it should stun , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See ? We 're inside sub , largely protected . When the stuff explodes , you and men make for the hole you blew in the ice above . " Another crash sent echoes resounding through the remaining compartment . All around the three were suit-clad figures , grotesque clumsy giants , all feeling new strength as they gulped with leathern throats and lungs at the artificial air which was giving them a respite , however brief , from the death they had been sinking into . In the third compartment of the Peary , five seal-like creatures with swift and beautiful movements picked up their torpoon battering ram again ; while all around the outside of the Peary their hundreds of watching fellows pressed in closely . * * * * * " Yes ! " cried Lawson , the scientist . " But the explosion -- it might shatter the ship ! " " No matter ; I expect it to ! " answered Ken . " Then you can leave through a crack instead of a port-lock . " " Yes -- but you ! " objected the captain . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping into my torpoon in the other port-lock . I 've got the food in it . Now , Sallorsen , this is your job . I 'll be in my torpoon , but I wo n't be able to let myself out the port . You open it , right after the explosion . Understand ? " " Yes , " replied Sallorsen , and Lawson nodded . " All right , " gasped Ken Torrance . " Empty the chamber . " As the captain did so , Ken opened the lid of the biscuit can and adjusted the timing device on the exposed unit in the clothing-wrapped bundle . Then he replaced it , ticking , in the can and thrust the can bodily into the emptied chamber of the port-lock . He closed the inner door of the chamber , and said to the men by him : " Close your face-plates ! " And Ken pushed the release button : and then he was running to the other port-lock and to his torpoon , and harnessing himself in . His brain teemed with the possibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting . How much would the submarine be smashed ? Would the charge of nitromite , besides killing the sealmen , kill everyone inside the Peary ? For that matter , would it affect the sealmen at all ? How much could the creatures stand ? And would the firing mechanism work ? And then would he himself be able to get out ; or would the lock in which the torpoon lay be damaged by the explosion and trap him there ? Seconds , only seconds , to wait , small fractions of time -- but they were more important than the days and the weeks that the Peary had lain , a lashed-down captive , under the Arctic ice ; for in these seconds was to be given fate 's final answer to the prayer and courage of them all . Time for Ken expanded . Surely the charge should have gone off long before this ! The pulse beat so loudly in his brain that he could hear nothing else . He counted : " ... nine , ten , eleven --  " Had the fuse failed ? Surely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the submarine Peary leaped . Ken Torrance , himself inside the torpoon , felt a sharp roll of thunder made tangible , and then complete darkness took him .... CHAPTER VII The Awakening He had no idea of how long he had been unconscious when , his full senses returning , he eagerly peered ahead through the torpoon 's vision-plate . For some seconds he could see nothing ; but he knew , at least , that the torpoon had survived the shock , for he was dry and snug in his harness . And then his eyes became accustomed to the darkness , and he saw that he was outside the submarine . Sallorsen had followed his orders ; had opened the port-lock ! The undersea reaches lay ahead of him , and the way was clear . Ken stared into a gray , silent sea , no longer shadowed with moving brown-skinned bodies . He tried his motors . Their friendly , rhythmic hum answered him , and carefully he slipped into gear and crept up off the sea-floor . He did not dare use his lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead thing without glow or movement , with no figures of sealmen around her . As Ken 's eyes gained greater vision , he was able to make out a wide , long rent running clear across the top of the fourth compartment of the submarine . The explosion had done that to her , but what had it done to her crew ? What had it done to the sealmen ? He saw the sealmen first . Some were quite close , but in the murk he had missed them . Silent specters , they were apparently lifeless , strewn all around at different levels , and most of them floating slowly up toward the dim ice ceiling . But up under the ice was movement ! Living figures were there ! And at the sight Kenneth Torrance 's lips spread in their first real grin for days . The plan had worked ! The sealmen had been destroyed , and already some of the Peary 's men were up there and fumbling clumsily across the hundred feet which separated them from the hole in the ice that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * A ghostly gray haze of light filtered downward through the water from the hole . Ken counted twelve figures making their way to it . As he wondered about the rest of the crew , he saw three bulging , swaying shapes suddenly emerge from the split in the top of the Peary , and begin an easy rise toward the ice ceiling ninety feet above . There was no apparent danger , and they went up quite slowly , with occasional brief pauses to avoid the risk of the bends . Clasped together , the group of three were , and when they were halfway to the glassy ceiling of the ice , three more left the rent in the submarine and followed likewise . Twelve men were at the top ; six others were swimming up ; three more were yet to leave the submarine -- and after they had abandoned her , he , Ken , would follow with the torpoon and the food it contained . So he thought , watching from where he lay , down below , and there was in him a great weariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rested through minutes of quiet and relaxation , watching what he had brought about ; but only minutes -- for suddenly without warning all security was gone . From out the murky shadows to the left a sleek shape came flashing with great speed , to jerk Ken Torrance 's eyes around and to widen them with quick alarm . A sealman ! A sealman alive , and moving -- and vengeful ! A sealman which the explosion of nitromite had not reached ! Doubtless the lone creature was surprised upon seeing all its fellows motionless , drifting like corpses upward , and the men of the Peary escaping . With graceful , beautiful speed , a liquid streak , it flashed into the scene , eeling up and around and down , trying to understand what extraordinary thing had happened . But finally it slowed down and hovered some thirty feet directly above the dark hull of the Peary . The men rising toward the ice had seen the sealman at the same time Ken Torrance had , and at once increased their efforts , fearing immediate attack . Quickly the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began a desperate fumbling progress over toward the hole that alone gave exit . But the sealman paid no attention to them . It was looking at something below . Ken saw what it was . The last three men were leaving the Peary . Awkward , swaying objects , they rose up directly in front of the hovering creature . * * * * * With an enraged thrust of flippers , it drove at them . The three humans -- Sallorsen , Lawson and one other , Ken knew they must be -- were clasped together , and the long , lithe , muscular body smote them squarely , sent them whirling and helpless in different directions in the sea-gloom . One of them was driven down by the force of the blow , and that one the sealman chose to finish first . It lashed at him , its strong teeth bared to rip the sea-suit , concentrating on him all the rage and all the thirst for vengeance it had . But by then , down below , the torpoon 's motors were throbbing at full power ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointing its nose upward ; and Ken Torrance , his face bleak as the Arctic ice , was grasping the trigger of the nitro-shell gun . He might perhaps have saved the doomed man had he swept straight up then and fired , but a quick mounting of the odds distracted him for a fatal second . Out of the deeper gloom at the left came a swiftly growing shadow , and Ken , with a sinking in his stomach , knew it for a second sealman . Then another similar shadow brought his eyes to the right . Two more sealmen ! Three now -- and how many more might come ? At once Ken knew what he must do before ever he fired a shell at one of the brown-skinned shapes . The man just attacked had to be sacrificed in the interests of the rest . The torpoon swerved , thrust up toward the ice ceiling under the full force of her motors ; and when halfway to it , and her gun-containing bow was pointed at a spot in the ice only twenty feet in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ken pressed the trigger ; and again , and again and again .... Twelve shells , quick , on the same path , bit into the ice . Almost immediately came the first explosion . It was swelled by the others . The ice shivered and crumbled in jagged splinters -- and then there was a new column of light reaching down from the world of air and life into the darkness of the undersea . A roughly circular hole gaped in the ice sixty or seventy feet nearer the swimming men than the old one . " That 'll give ' em a chance , " muttered Kenneth Torrance . He plunged the torpoon around and down . " And now for a fight ! " * * * * * Without pause , now , there was , straight ahead , a hard , desperate duel , a fitting last fight for any torpoon or any man riding one . Each of the seven shells left in the nitro-gun 's magazine had to count ; and the first of them gave a good example . Ken turned down in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His suit was ripped clean across , his air of life went up in bubbles , and the water came in . The seal-creature lunged at its falling victim a last time , and as it did so its smooth brown body crossed Ken 's sights . The torpooner fired , and saw his shell strike home , for the body shuddered , convulsed , and the sealman , internally torn , went sinking in a dark cloud after the human it had slain . That sight gave pause to the other two creatures that had arrived , and gave Ken Torrance a good second chance . Motor throbbing , the torpoon turned like a thing alive . Its snout and gun-sights swerving straight toward the next target . But , when just on the point of pressing the trigger , Ken 's torpoon was struck a terrific blow and tumbled over and over . The whole external scene blurred to him , and only after a moment was he able to bring the torpoon back to an even keel . He saw what had happened . While he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torpoon from the rear by striking it with all the strength of its heavy , muscular body . But it did not follow up its attack . For it had crashed in to the whirling propeller , and now it was hanging well back , its head horribly gashed by the steel blades . For a moment the three combatants hung still , both sealmen staring at the torpoon as if in wonder that it could strike both with its bow and stern , and Ken Torrance rapidly glancing over the situation . The remaining two of the last group of three men , he saw , had reached the top , and the foremost of the Peary 's crew were within several feet of the new hole in the ice . In a very short time all would be out and safe . Until then he had to hold off the two sealmen . Two ? There were no longer only two , but five -- ten -- a dozen -- and more . The dead were coming to life ! Here and there in the various levels of drifting , motionless brown bodies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awakening ! The explosion had but stunned many or most of them , and now they were returning to consciousness ! CHAPTER VIII The Duel Upon seeing this , all hope for life left Ken . He had only six shells left , and at best he could kill only six sealmen . Already , there were more than twenty about him , completely encircling the torpoon . They seemed afraid of it , and yet desirous of finishing it -- they hung back , watching warily the thing that could strike and hurt from either end ; but Ken knew , of course , that he could not count on their inaction long . One concerted charge would mean his quick end , and the death of most of the men above . Well , there was only one thing to do -- try to hold them off until those men above had climbed out , every one . With this plan in mind , he maneuvered for a commanding position . Quietly he slid his motor into gear , and slowly the torpoon rose . At this first movement , the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly pressed in again , however , as the torpoon came to a halt where Ken wanted it -- a position thirty feet beneath , and slightly to one side , of the escaping men above , with an angle of fire commanding the area the sealmen would have to cross to attack them . Almost at once came action . One of the surrounding creatures swerved suddenly up toward the men . Instinctively angling the torp , Ken sent a nitro-shell at it ; and the chance aim was good . The projectile caught the sealman squarely , and , after the convulsion , it began to drift downward , its body torn apart . " That 'll teach you , damn you ! " Ken muttered savagely , and , to heighten the effect he had created , he brought his sights to bear on another sealman in the circle around him -- and fired and killed . This sight of sudden death told on the others . They grew obviously more fearful and gave back , though still forming a solid circle around the torpoon . The circle was ever thickening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered unconscious returned to life . And then , above , the first man reached the hole , clawed at its rough edges and levered himself through . That was a signal . From somewhere beneath , two brown bodies flashed upward in attack . Fearing a general rush at any second , Ken fired twice swiftly . One shell missed , but the other slid to its mark . Almost alongside its fellow , one of the creatures was shattered and torn , and that evidently altered the other 's intentions , for it abandoned the attack and sought safety in the mass of its fellows on the farther side . Another respite . Another man through the hole . And but two nitro-shells left ! * * * * * The deadly circle , like wolves around a lone trapper who crouches close to his dying fire , pressed in a little ; and by their ominous quietness , by the sight of their eyes all turned in on him , their concerted inching closer , Ken sensed the nearness of the charge that would finish him . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not yell and brandish his fists at them as the trapper by the fire might have done to win a few extra minutes . The only cards he had to play were two shells -- and one was needed now ! He fired it with deliberate , sure aim , and grunted as he saw its victim convulse and die , with dark blood streaming . Again the swarm hesitated . Ken risked a glance above . Only three men left , he saw ; and one was pulled through the hole as he watched . Below , in one place , several seal-creatures surged upward . " Get back , damn you ! " he cursed harshly . " All right -- take it ! That 's the last ! " And the last shell hissed out from the gun even as the last man , above , was pulled through up into the air and safety . Ken felt that he had given half his life with that final shell . Completely surrounded by a hundred or more of the sealmen , he could not possibly hope to maneuver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , without being overwhelmed . He had held off the swarm long enough for the others to escape , but for himself it was the end . So he thought , and wondered just when that end would come . Soon , he knew . It would not take them long to overcome their fear when they saw that he no longer reached out and struck them down in sudden bloody death . Now it was their turn . " Anyway , " the torpooner murmured , " I got ' em out . I saved them . " But had he ? Suddenly his mind turned up a dreadful thought . He had saved them from the sealmen , but they were up on the ice without food . There had been no time to apportion rations in the submarine ; all the supplies were stacked around him in the torpoon ! Searching planes would eventually appear overhead , but if he could not get the food up to the men it meant their death as surely as if they had stayed locked in the Peary ! But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living wall edging inch by inch upon him , visibly on the brink of rushing him . Some carried ropes with which they would lash the torpoon down as they had the others . Must all he and those men had gone through , be in vain ? Must he die -- and the others ? For certainly without food , those men above on the lonely ice fields , all of them weakened by the long siege in the submarine , would perish quickly .... And then a faintly possible plan came to him . It involved an attempt to bluff the seal-creatures. * * * * * Thirty feet above the lone man in the torpoon was the hole he had blasted in the ice . He knew that from the cone of light which filtered down ; he did not dare to take his eyes for a second from the creatures around him , for all now depended on his judging to a fraction just when the lithe , living wall would leap to overwhelm him . Now the torpoon was enclosed by what was more a sphere of brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid sphere . It stretched thinly to within a few feet of the ice ceiling where , in one place , was the hole Ken had blown in the ice . He began to play the game . He edged the gears into reverse , gently angled the diving-planes , and slowly the torpoon tilted in response and began to sink back to the dark sea-floor . Motion appeared in the curved facade of sleek brown heads and bodies in front and to the sides . The creatures behind and below , Ken could not see ; he could only trust to the fear inspired by the damage his propeller had wreaked on one of them , to hold them back . However , he could judge the movements of those behind and below by the synchronized movements of those in front ; for the sealmen , in this tense siege , seemed to move as one -- just as they would move as one when a leader got the courage to charge across the gap to the torpoon . In reverse , slowly , the torpoon backed downward . Every minute seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move fast at this juncture , and he needed to retreat not less than fifty feet . Fifty feet ! Would they hold off long enough for him to make it ? Foot by foot the torpoon edged down at her forty-five-degree angle , and with every foot the watching bodies became visibly bolder . There was no light inside the torpoon -- inner light would decrease the visibility outside -- but Ken knew her controls as does the musician his instrument . Slowly the propeller whirled over , the torpoon dropped , slowly the diffused light from the hole above diminished -- and slowly the eager wall of sealmen followed and crept in . Twenty-five feet down ; and then , after a long time , thirty-five feet , and forty . Seventy feet up , in all , to the hole in the ice .... Ken wanted seventy-five feet , but he could not have it . For the wall of sleek bodies broke . One or two of the creatures surged forward ; other followed ; they were coming ! The slim torpoon leaped under the unleashed power of her motors -- forward. * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . The vision of the hole was obscured by a twisting , whirling maelstrom of bodies , and the torpoon quivered and shook like a living thing in agony under glancing blows . But then came a patch of light , a pathway of light , leading straight up at a forty-five-degree angle to the hole in the ice above . Sealmen and torpoon had leaped forward at the same moment . Doubtless the creatures had not expected the shell to move so suddenly and decisively ahead , so that when it did , those in the van swerved to escape head-on contact . The torpoon gained speed all too slowly for her pilot . It naturally took time to gain full forward speed from a standing start . But she moved , and she moved fast , and after her poured the full tide of sealmen , now that they saw their prey running in retreat . From somewhere ahead appeared a rope , noosed to catch the fleeing prey . It slipped off the side . Another touched the bow , but it too was thrown off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sweeping up at the full speed Ken had gone back to be able to attain . He needed full speed ! The plan would fail at the last moment without it ! Another rope ; but it was the seal-creature 's last gesture . Through the side plates of quarsteel the light grew fast ; the ice was only ten feet away ; a slight directional correction brought the hole dead ahead -- and at full speed , twenty-four miles an hour , the torpoon passed through and into the thin air of the world of light and life . Right out of the hole , a desperate fugitive from below , she leaped , her propeller suddenly screaming , and arched high through the air before she dove with a rending , splintering crash onto the upper side of the sheet ice . And the sun of a cloudless , perfect Arctic day beat down on her ; and men were all around , eagerly reaching to open her entrance port . It was done . * * * * * Kenneth Torrance , dazed , battered , hurting in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and felt hands reach in and clasp him . Wearily he helped them lift him out into the thin sunlight . Sitting down , slitting his eyes against the sudden glare , he peered around . Captain Sallorsen was beside him , supporting him with one hand and pounding him on the back with the other ; and there in front was the bearded scientist , Lawson , and the rest of the men . Ken took a great gulp of the clean , cold air . " Gosh ! " was all he could say . " Gosh , that tastes good ! " " Man , you did it ! " shouted Sallorsen . " How , in God 's name , I do n't know -- but you did it ! " " He did ! " said Lawson . " And he did it all himself . Even to the food , which should keep us till a plane comes by . If they have n't stopped searching for us . " His words reminded Ken of something . " Oh , there 'll be a plane over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I stole this torpoon -- see ?  - -  and told the fellows they could come and get it somewhere right around here . " Kenneth Torrance grinned , and glanced down at the battered steel shell which had borne him out of the water below . " And here it is , " he finished . " A little damaged -- but then I did n't promise it would be as good as new ! " * * * * *
