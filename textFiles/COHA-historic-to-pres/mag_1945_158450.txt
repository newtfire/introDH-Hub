As is his custom , Bernard M. Baruch , 74 , sat on a park bench one day last week - this time in London . He was not , as he usually is when sitting on his park bench in Washington , D.C. , " in " to reporters . He would talk to only one : a man from Stars &; Stripes . Corporal A. Victor Lasky and Baruch sat chatting together for a while , continued the conversation in Baruch 's plush Claridge suite . When the phone rang ( it was Churchill calling ) , Baruch , friend of the Prime Minister for 25 years , begged off for the moment . For Bernie Baruch had a point he wanted to get over to all G.I.s : quit worrying . After the war . there will be at least five to seven years ' prosperity , " no matter what is done or not done . " <P> Corporal Lasky quoted Baruch as saying then : " What happens after those five or seven years depends on the peace the big boys are preparing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to hold the big stick over the big boys to make damn sure they 're not going to foul up the peace . " <P> When Baruch saw the story Lasky wrote , he insisted on some major changes . One Baruch quote ( " We 've got to so de-industrialize Germany and Japan - at least for a generation - that they wo n't go to war again " ) , might make effective Ger man propaganda . The reference to the Churchill phone call might be considered too cavalier by his British hosts . And Mr. Baruch did not use language like " damn " and " foul up . " Stars &; Stripes obligingly cut out the offending passages - but the Associated Press had already sent Lasky 's original story back to the U.S. <P> Baruch 's red-faced press secretary ( who apparently believes that newsmen should not take down offhand remarks too literally ) complained : " Lasky wrote his story as if he was covering a fire .
