" JUST the one to marry a minister " So our friends said when the engagement was announced . What the moral and spiritual properties of a minister 's wife should be , as differentiated from other men 's wives , I have never been able to discover , but this I can truly say : I was satisfied not only with my husband , but with his profession . How thankful was I that he had not chosen a literary career , as , certain friends advised , or en tered the law , where others prophesied success ! Before we were installed in our first parish I had studied the church ' roll , and every name was at my tongue 's end , ready to be applied when the owner appeared . I looked at the congregation as a company of saints . I would not have exchanged that first parsonage for the office of the Secretary of State at Washington or for an appointment as ambassador to the Court of St. James . // Twenty years have passed . The enthusiasm of youth has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has furnished the test by which we form true judgment . My husband has occupied influential pulpits in both Western and Eastern cities . We have had delightful homes , a comfortable income , appreciative congregations , and social advantages greater than fall to the lot of the average minister . If I have learned that a parish is not composed exclusively of saints , I have likewise learned that the mistakes and weaknesses of parishioners are necessary incidents in the process of spirited development , and their more serious faults I have come to regard as simply evolutionary growing-pains . I am still satisfied with my husband , still glad that he is a minister ; yet I secretly rejoice that our son shows no predilection for a theological seminary ; I might even be tempted to maternal tactics in order to frustrate a clerical alliance for our daughter . I believe that men of the greatest genius and highest culture may find in this profession a worthy sphere of activity , and that , as knowledge increases , religious organizations will become associations for spiritual uplifting and practical helpfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no profession is attended with more subtle temptations . We are far from the realization of the ideal , if indeed we are advancing toward it . From the first , loyalty to my husband made me extremely sensitive to slurs upon his profession . I was offended by the characterizations of literature in which the typical clergyman is an erudite gentleman , quite ignorant of worldly affairs , and abjectly fawning before wealth and power . The clergyman 's wife , an amiable creature , adoring her husband , is quite unsophisticated and ill at ease in the presence of the cultured parishioner . The drama , which probes human defects to the quick , represents the priest as a sleek , well - fed personage , using the lamb 's wool of his office for divers chicaneries . Public sentiment evidently regards the minister as a paid attorney , whose living is little better than a gratuity , and whose character lacks the qualities of virile manhood . By degrees the conviction has come to me that , among the learned professions , the one which is nominally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never without foundation . Evidently , some essential element of confidence is lacking . We to whom the profession is dear ought to look at the case courageously and dispassionately . This I have sought to do , and have become convinced that , however much individual ministers may be at fault , the evil lies primarily with our ecclesiastical machinery . It is as difficult for a pastor to carry out his ideals , in our highly organized religious systems , as for a right-minded mayor to realize the ideals of municipal government , hampered by the city charter and the demands of his political party . A condition so common as to be almost a constant problem is financial stringency . Every one behind the scenes is conscious of general poverty . Churches are not only poor , but very generally encumbered with debt . A wealthy congregation does not alter the fact of chronic poverty . It is what the congregation gives , not the bank account of individual members , which consti - tutes ecclesiastical opulence . In our parish , a poor shoemaker gives much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church is the first to suffer from a business panic , and the last to feel the returning wave of prosperity . When retrenchment is necessary , economy finds its first expression in the contribution plate . Indeed , I sometimes query how those families which can not afford a pew in church can yet afford a box at the opera . In many cities and rapidly growing towns , the older churches suffer from the shift- deleted material // about which we talk piously , resolves itself usually into some scheme of moneygetting . Festivals , fairs , concerts , ers , distract supp listract attention and usurp higher interests . It is hardly necessary to state that when both minister and people are in mad search for dollars a truly devotional spirit can not exist . Another insidious foe of the church is the curious custom of estimating results by numerical showing . Every denomination has a system of bookkeeping , by which the statistics of the local churches are tabulated . The minister of each parish reports annually the net result of his work , ? the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or removal , contributions to the benevolences under the patronage of the denomination . The returns are published in book form , and the gain or loss is expressed arithmetically . In order to assist in the mechanical part of parish work , it has been my self-imposed task to look after the church records ; and , in the capacity of secretary , I became conscious of the constant pressure to keep up and augment membership . In decadent communities it is difficult to make gains cover losses . Perhaps this accounts for inaccuracy in ecclesiastical posting . Old names are allowed to remain on the list long after the individuals bearing them have removed from the parish or have been gathered to their fathers . When the records are thoroughly " purged , " the figures show a large shrinkage . A church accredited with a membership of one thousand may easily shrink to eight hundred , and the minister who eliminates the dead wood must bear the odium of the clearing . When progress is estimated by numbers , the minister and his wife , perforce , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was the advice of a scheming prelate , when my husband assumed the care of an institutional church : " that ' s where you ' 11 make your counts . " Perhaps , also , it encourages elasticity in the test of mem bership . Thus a noted infidel of our acquaintance was urged by a distinguished clergyman to be confirmed . " I ' 11 make it easy for you , " he argued obligingly . Tice pressure for numerical growth is shared by the congregation . When a communion seasons arrives , and no candidates are propounded , the brethren and sisters are dispirited . The test of organic strength is in the length of the roll call , and not in the quantity and quality of spiritual life . Joy reigns when a goodly number gather for the first time about the altar , especially if there are boys and men in the group . New members are reported , not as souls , but as " male " and " female . " The latter are so much in excess that males are considered great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the benevolences of his church up to the high-water ' nark . Parochial gifts are scrutinized by the denominational fathers as the campaign fund is watched by political bosses . Here is a dilemma of divided sympathy . On one side the minister finds a group who are jealous of denominational honor . They implore him to quicken the sentiment for sectarian pledges . They deplore contributions which will not be credited in the annual report . They are offended when an " outside " cause is presented . On the other is a group who discredit sectarian propagandism . They demand that the pulpit address itself to the practical philanthropies close at hand . How shall the minister retain prestige in the ecclesiastical hierarchy , crushed between the millstones of denominational and local demands ? But by far the greatest obstacle in the path of the minister , and hence a constant perplexity to the minister 's wife , is our highly organized systems of ecclesiastical government , and the emphasis placed upon philosophical thought . Each sect has a centralized system of government , and is conducted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our deleted material // Garden of Eden .

For him no gracious " Go in peace ; thy sins are forgiven . " The congregation may be deceived , but what of the man who makes a business of kneeling to false gods ? Then we have the minister of profound insight and open vision . He is loyal to his deepest convictions , and gives the truth without reservation . He espouses unpopular reforms ; his dress is that of a man among men ; he is never seen in public places with a limp-covered Bible under his arm . His manner is unostentatious , his language simple and direct , his eloquence that of genuine purpose . Business men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never before knew what , it is to be a Christian . You have made the religious life practical and genuine . " Yet , strange to say , things do not go well in the parish . Some old lady misses the traditional phraseology ; the deacons fear the influence of practical teaching on the young ; factional prejudices are roused ; pews are given up , the salary is rut down ; heresy trials threaten . At last this honest man cries out in bitterness , " With a great price obtained I this liberty ! " and sometimes , in loneliness of heart , he exclaims , " My God , host thou forsaken ms ? " Let the advocates of an open pulpit and an open college inaugurate a bread-and-butter fund for the maintenance of untrammeled preachers and professors ! Another temptation to insincerity meets both the minister and his wife on the social side . They must be friends of each member of the little flock . Now friendship is not made to order ; it is the spontaneous result of affinity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may be vulgar , superstitious , ignorant , depraved , or even hostile . The temptation is to assume an interest which would not exist under other circumstances . An acquaintance , for many years it popular clergyman 's wife , has shown , since the death of her husband , the prevalence of manufactured interest . " Count me out now , " she says , very frankly . " I am not going to church unless I feel like it . I am not going to visit people whom I do not care to know . " Passing from these general subjects , let me speak of those which more intimately concern the minister 's wife . During these twenty years , the sense of insecurity of position has been a constant undertone of anxiety and an unfailing shadow in the background of endeavor . The only parallel is the politician 's tenure of office . The economic principles which dominate the conduct of other men are , with the minister , entirely reversed . Any apparent effort to better his condition is sure defeat . Money can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The church gives to its pastor quite as much as the pastor gives to his people . The minister of a prominent congregation occupies a position of dignity quite beyond and independent of personal merit . A minister without charge is distrusted . He is Jean Valjean with his yellow convict passport . Hence the clerical rule , " Never take up your foot until you know where you are going to put it down . " A minister often endures untold indignities and remains , when both lie and the congregation are secretly praying for deliverance . The minister without charge may be more desirable than he of the parish . Personal selfishness induces one to remain where his service is not desired . Chivalrous feeling and self-respect cause the other to retire . Moreover , the parish is quite as often at fault as the minister . permission . 208 Confessions of a Minister 's Wife . The process of gaining a new field is often fraught with ignominy and humiliation . Some one has well said , " If there be anything contingent in the Divine Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pastor . " The first step is to appoint a committee , whose business is to scour the country for the right man . All churches are self-complacent , and , however difficult the work , however meagre the stipend , demand a first - class preacher and pastor . The committee of minister-tasters require months , and sometimes years , of experimenting before a nominee can be agreed upon . Then his record is looked up , and a tentative overture is made . The overture is carefully guarded , and the chairman discreetly intimates that he has only the authority of an advisory agent . A church does not commit itself , however , without some assurance of success . It is as if a youth said to his maiden : " It is possible I may wish to marry you . If I so decide , will your answer be affirmative ? " His affirmation having been secured , the minister may be jilted without even a courteous explanation . " Candidating " is now disclaimed by churches of reputation . Whatever the course adopted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covertly preaches in a neighboring church , or the congregation act on the advice of the committee , the case must be brought before the people for final vote . Every detail concerning this unhappy man is openly discussed in the parish meeting , ? his health , his age , his personal appearance , the quality of his voice , his theological and political opinions , his skill as an organizer , his social gifts . His wife , also , must be a discreet and godly person ; always wisely helpful , but never officious . The one essential , spiritual power and practical righteousness , does not so much concern these census takers . All the offensive details of the parish meeting are talked of in the streets and the corner grocery . They are allowed to go into the hands of the enterprising reporter , and , with proper editorial embellishments , are served to the general public . Doubtless the law of causality operates in calling a minister , but the effect is so remote , so untraceable , that the outcome seems more like fatalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Too damn pious ! " was the actual ver . diet of an important member of an in. portant congregation upon my husband . A minister has been deposed for no greater offense than subscribing to the Outlook . A gifted preacher lost a pro . minent church because one man , of me. chanical mind and fat pocketbook , objected to a single sentence in the evening sermon . The public , says Thackeray , is a jackass . The average congregation , to speak more civilly , is sadly lacking in discrimination . Perhaps fifteen out of one hundred catch the real thought of the speaker . Defective hearing is the cause of constant misapprehension and misquotation . In other callings , C011. tracts are made between peers who have equal advantage in the decision . In this profession , the vote of a miss in her teens , a timid old woman , a blundering drayman , an unreasoning bigot , is as powerful as that of the intelligent and fair-minded . When factional passions have been roused , the most objectionable methods may be introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister in question is absolutely defenseless . He has nothing of value in the world except bis character . This he may see traduced , his motives impugned , misconceptions unexplained , yet Inc most remain silent . The question of ways and means is always serious in the minister 's family . Since the average salary is eight hundred dollars , it follows that life with average pastors is both frugal and strenuous . Most of them live from hand to mouth , and are denied not only comforts , but the equipment which is necessary for intelligent work . The minister 's // tools are not simply pen and ink bottle , but a library and current literature . Their children are educated with great difficulty , and for the " rainy day " they must depend upon charitably disposed neighbors or the fund for disabled ministers . The average lawyer has not only a more generous income and less demand for gratuitous service , but a longer period of productive activity . This time limit is the bide noire of the ministerial profession . After seven years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apprenticeship in some obscure or indigent church , where his latent possibilities are tested . He makes the real start of life at the age of thirty or over ; at forty-five the shadows of coming dissolution stealthily approach . The minister 's period of effective service in therefore within the radius of fifteen or twenty years . " The old minister , " says Ian Maclaren , " ought to be shot , " and the dead line is fixed at fifty . In law , in medicine , in civil government , society demands men of wisdom and experience . The church only gives preference to striplings . A business man said recently to my husband , " I suppose that your fens are a very considerable item in the annual budget . " " How much , " he replied , " do you imagine I receive from this source ? " " Well , from eight hundred to one thousand dollars per year . " " ' That amount , " said my husband , " would cover the fees of my entire ministry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marriages are rare events in parish history , and optional gratuity is meagre . A five-dollar bill expresses the happiness of the average bridegroom , and fifteen dollars implies exuberance of joy . Twice in oar experience of twenty years the bridegroom has reached the hundred mark . Occasionally compensation is offered for attendance upon funerals : no right-minded man , however , accepts a fee for service in the house of mourning . The frequent imputation that minisVOL. // ters have no sense of honor in financial matters has led me to close observation of their actual record . We have always paid our bills like other people , and so do our ministerial friends , even those living on starvation salaries . Rebates are extremely rare . Indeed , I have learned to avoid the milkman and coal dealer of our own congregation , because the ordinary protests against blue milk and light weight are impossible . Clerical half fares and " reductions to the cloth " are unusual , and are more than balanced by gratuitous service to the community . I have often been commiserated upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impression prevails that tine parsonage is an open house , where chance guests appear at inopportune moments , and that the minister 's wife is an unsalaried assistant , a victim to female prayer meetings and Dorcas Societies . Never having met with injustices of this kind in my own experience , I have been for some years in search of the abused clergyman 's wife , in both city and country parishes . I have come to the conclusion that she is a myth . But I will speak only for myself . Neither the parish nor the public have presumed upon our hospitality . Our house is an open house only as we make it so . Instead of asking me to take up parish drudgeries , our people have always shielded me from them . Often they say , " You must not do this , because you are the minister 's wife . " So far as my observation goes , the church makes no demand upon the minister 's wife ; what she does , or refrains from doing , is at her own volition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The church engaged my husband , not me . " The clergyman 's wife has the same interest in the church that every loyal member feels , plus the interest that every loyal wife has in her husband 's life work . A parish , large or small , demands not only the gift of tongues , but that of a pastor and an administrator . The wife cotperates in these various functions . She secures the study from interruption , keeps in touch with theological literature , suggests references bearing on the theme of the discourse , supplying , consciously or unconsciously , the feminine thought element . " Do you ever criticise your husband ? " I am sometimes asked . Yes , from invocation to benediction , if there is aught to criticise . The pastor is responsible for the movement and efficiency of the entire organization . His wife , as far as possible , should share that responsibility . Never a baptismal service that I do not casually ascertain if the sexton has filled the font . The feminine mind instinctively keeps track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls , which formerly partook of a religious nature , are now more purely social , and the tendency is to abandon them entirely . Yet , in the world of affairs , great stress is laid upon the social instinct . A very indifferent preacher may build up a strong congregation through friendly visitations . A woman , through her quick intuition , her tact and native instinct , recognizes the social needs of the parish , quickening and reinforcing the slower methods of the masculine mind . " Where shall I call to-day ? " is a frequent question . The wise wife is ready with a carefully selected list , and the battle is half fought . At first I made calls with my husband . I soon observed that our people always preferred to talk with the minister . So I learned to bid him Godspeed without resentment or self-depreciation . Often there are perplexities , doubts , sorrows , and even joys , which can be better expressed to him in confidence . When I call alone , I am received with undivided cordiality . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the congregation , adapting herself to their various needs , and helping each to the best . The more courage , the more sympathy , the more wisdom , the more spir itual illumination , the greater her ministry . As I recall my comrades among all denominations , the one who fills my ideal of a pastor 's wife is a dear Methodist sister , of sainted memory . She wore a brochd shawl , a rusty black gown , and an antiquated bonnet . But she had the grace of God in her heart ; high and low , rich and poor , lettered and mildtered , sat at her feet . General interest in the members of the congregation is no bar to special and eon. genial friendship either within or outside the parish . The only restraint I ever feel is in relation to ethical and sociolo. gical questions . When the trustees and representative pewholders are engaged in business trusts and combines , the minis. ter 's wife , at the Woman 's Club , often with a lurking sense of moral cowardice , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the prevailing sentiment is conservative , she is too judicious to appear at a suffrage convention . However , the wife of the lawyer , the physician , the editor , is under similar bondage to a professional clientage . While the church stands preeminently as a religious institution , it has a manysided life , ? social , educational , philanthropic . Ostensibly democratic , it yet reflects the social aspirations of its members . Thus we have an " aristocratic congregation " and a " people 's church . " In the aristocratic church , the Sunday school is composed chiefly of mission scholars . In this church , a reception is a bore , the prayer meeting languishes , and the congregation is " cold " toward strangers . A healthy congregation is composed largely of " plain people , " who are the working bees of the religious hive . The commingling of all sorts and conditions is desirable , because they unconsciously modify each other . The social life of a church is dominated by women . How large a factor it has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor are as deleted material 212 Confessions of a Minister 's Wife . impossible without a genuine purpose . So the first care of the officers is to inaugurate linger occupation . It is a great boon when a destitute family must be sewed up , or a charitable institution appeals for pillowcases , or a missionary box is to be filled . But any effort to remove the causes of poverty and suffering , ? like temperance work or sociological reform , ? this kind of " Ladies ' Aid " I have never seen . The benevolences of the church are not yet conducted in the scientific spirit ; their aim is palliative , not curative . For many years I have been an officer on the Board of Missions , and everywhere I have found indifference . The aggregate of contributions to foreign missions amounts annually to millions of dollars . Yet I venture to say that if we knew the history of each individual dollar , very few would prove a loving , genuine gift . I myself have given chiefly because my position demanded it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . They represent the intense interest of it few individuals . These individuals are always women . They spur on the minister , hector the rich , stimulate the poor , quicken the conscienceless . In a certain church which had failed to raise its apportionment , one lowly , earliest woman , at the eleventh hour , went from house to house and secured the quota . So far as I could discover , the contributors felt more compassion for the woman than interest in the cause ; or they were wearied by her importunity . The case is typical . The Woman 's Boards in all denominations are admirably organized societies , with frequent local meetings , annual and semiannual rallies . The officers have personal re lations with the higher ecclesiastical functionaries , and are zealous in filling all pledges to the Board . A woman 111 ? 1V hold office in a missionary society , and even speak at its public meetings , without danger of social ostracism , as in temperance work . Indeed , I often think that our officers enjoy their little arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the denominational spirit for if the majority of a congregation should reach that stage of spiritual development in which sectarian interest were lost in zeal for the kingdom of righteousness , the fealty of the Woman 's Board would prevent practical steps toward comity . Federation of the denominations at home is more likely to come at the instance of the missionary abroad . He sees the waste of money and the waste of spiritual power which spring from divided effort , while we at home have our eyes fastened upon the ledger books of our Missionary Boards . Do I , then , not believe in missions ? Yes , in the development of the religious life which is found among all peoples . Do I not love the church ? There is no choice . " Wherever one hand reaches out to help another , there is the church of God . " Do I depreciate creeds ? Yes , every creed which I may not restate in accordance with the demands of my growing spiritual nature . Do I honor the Christian minister Yes , the prophet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No .
