Planetary nebulae show nature 's approval of recycling . The nebulae are glowing balls , disks , and squirts cast off from stars in decline that litter the Milky Way Galaxy like so much stellar refuse . Like an increasing amount of refuse on Earth , the blown-out gas is headed or recycling . The material in planetary nebulae will move slowly into the interstellar medium , giving itself to new stars that will form in the future . Tracking this subtly glowing stellar waste in your backyard scope takes you on a tour of some of the prettiest forms you can see among deep-sky objects . Blue-green starlike blobs , rings , shells , disks with Saturn-like extensions , all sorts of eerily glowing shapes await your hunting them down . The really bright planetaries offer little challenge , so I like to go after the faint ones , the planetaries that require a keen eye and an 8-inch or 10-inch scope to see some detail . ( During great seeing you can see detail in some of them with a 6-inch scope . ) So get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any nebula filters you may have , and prepare for a tour of the sky 's most challenging planetary nebulae . A detailed star atlas such as Uranometria 2000.0 by Wil Tirion , Barry Rappaport , and George Lovi will show all of these objects . If you stand outside in the early evening right now , you can see the winter Milky Way arching overhead . We 'll start with the challenging planetaries of Cassiopeia , now low in the northwest , and make our way around the sky eastward , highlighting some of the most enjoyable targets for moderate-sized scopes . Cassiopeia 's bright W-shape hides a large group of faint planetaries . Start with Hubble 12 , an object glowing faintly at magnitude 14.0 and measuring just 1 " across . ( The magnitudes given in this article are photographically determined . Traditional visual magnitudes are one or 1-1/2 magnitudes brighter . ) Such a tiny object will test your eyesight and your scope 's optics : In good seeing , you should be able to crank up the power and find this object about 45 ' southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzzy , disklike appearance . A nebula filter , particularly a UHC , Deep-Sky , or H-beta filter , placed over the eyepiece will dim the stars surrounding Hubble 12 . The filter will allow the nebular light to pass through , maintaining Hubble 12 's original brightness and revealing its identity . The nebula 's 15th-magnitude central star is a challenge . More varied forms or nebular structure are visible in Cassiopeia 's Humason 1-1 , IC 1747 , and IC 289 . A smooth disk , Humason 1-1 ( mag . 13.3 , Size 5 " ) lies less than 2deg north-northwest of 5th-magnitude Lambda ( lambda ) Cas . IC 1747 ( mag . 13.6 , size 13 " ) is easier to find , lying just 30 ' southeast of 3rd-magnitude Epsilon ( Epsilon ) Cas . This strange object may amuse you because of its odd appearance : At high powers the object appears as an irregular disk with traces of ringlike structure . Glimpsing the nebula 's 16th-magnitude central star will not be easy . The much brighter IC 289 ( mag . 12.3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a dark night . The challenge here is eyeing the inner disk and faint , outer ring that surround the nebula 's 17th-magnitude central star . Should these nebulae fail to impress you , move southeastward along the Milky Way into Perseus . Aim your scope less than a degree north-northwest of the variable star Phi ( Phi ) Persei and you 'll be delighted by the Little Dumbbell Nebula ( M76 , NGC 650-1 ) , a magnitude 12.2 object covering a whopping 65 " . The central star glows at magnitude 16 , so you wo n't see it without a huge backyard scope . What you will see is the object 's pretty winglike structure that makes it faintly resemble a butterfly or the much larger and brighter Dumbbell Nebula in Vulpecula ( hence its nickname ) . The dumbbell appearance is caused by a ring of dust around the star that squeezes the outrushing gas into two lobes . The Little Dumbbell is one of the most challenging objects in the famous Messier catalog of clusters , nebulae , and galaxies . Fellow residents o the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both lying in a rich field of stars between Zeta ( Zeta ) and Omicron ( o ) Persei and the California Nebula . Seeing detail in these objects will test the most accomplished observers and the steadiest nights . IC 351 ( mag . 12.4 , size 7 " ) is a little disk of gray-green light . Can you see its brightness rise slightly toward the center ? The 15th-magnitude central star may be within reach of big backyard scopes . Just 2deg southeast is IC 2003 ( mag . 12.6 , size 7 " ) a smooth disk of even light . Before plunging south , detour north to the vast , dim constellation Camelopardalis to see NGC 1501 ( mag . 13.3 , size 52 " ) , which lies in a barren region 1deg south of the variable UV Camelopardali . This delightful object is plainly visible in any scope , but moderate magnification and a nebula filter bring out the irregular disk that will appear mottled . Resuming the southward journey , you may wish to visit NGC 1514 ( mag . 10.9 , size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , detailed object resides 2deg north-northeast of 5th-magnitude Psi ( Psi ) Tauri . Those who have been disappointed by faint central stars will now get their reward . The star glows at magnitude 9.4 , making it brighter than the surrounding nebula , which appears as an eerie glow composed of a blotchy , irregular disk . Toward the east , grabbing the bull by the horns , is Auriga . Here you 'll find the small , bright disk of IC 2149 ( mag . 11.2 , size 8 " ) . The nebula is remarkably easy to find because it lies just over 1deg north-northwest of 2nd-magnitude Beta ( Beta ) Aurigae . Peering into the eyepiece may not immediately separate IC 2149 from the many background stars . But careful viewing at moderately high power will reveal the nebula 's splotchy , ringlike disk surrounding a more uniform , inner disk of velvety light . The stream of the Milky Way now cascades southeastward into Gemini , where two more challenging planetaries recycle . 900 ( mag . 12.4 , size 8 " ) hangs suspended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamma ( y ) Geminorum . This object resembles IC 2149 but is a full magnitude fainter . Far more delightful is NGC 2371-2 ( mag . 13.0 , size 55 " ) , a big , faint nebula lying 1-1/2deg north of 4th-magnitude Iota ( iota ) Gem . Riding along the great ghostly arc of light known as Barnard 's Loop brings us to the splendid constellation Orion , a deep-sky paradise of the winter sky . Orion 's 320 and NGC 2022 are both challenging objects for medium-sized scopes . J320 ( mag . 12.9 , size 7 " ) lies 1-1/2deg " northwest of the 5th-magnitude double star 16 Orionis . Observers with large scopes may spot the 14th-magnitude central star . NGC 2022 ( mag . 12.4 , size 18 " ) , located just over 1deg east of Psi sup 2 ( Psi sup 2 ) Ori in the " shoulders " of the hunter , is much easier to separate from the background stars . A final target for the winter Milky Way , NGC 2438 ( mag . 10.1 , size 66 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M46 in Puppis . Hence , it appears to be floating inside the cluster . This beautiful pairing adds to the visual delight of NGC 438 , which looks like a distinct ring in a moderate-size scope . Dozens more challenging planetary nebulae lie scattered across the winter and summer skies , and a few dot the stark regions of sky in spring and autumn ( see map on pp. 76-77 ) . ( Map omitted ) Among the summer 's greatest hits are the gorgeous glowing disk NCC 6781 in Aquila , the flattened Bug Nebula ( NGC 6302 ) in Scorpius , and the beautiful ring NCC 6337 in Scorpius . The wispy shells you have just explored are challenges that should encourage you to explore further . As always , ASTRONOMY wants to hear about your observations . In the meantime , enjoy these winter objects . If they have invited you to observe more critically and to get your telescope out more often , then these balls of recycling gas will have opened a new window on the sky .
