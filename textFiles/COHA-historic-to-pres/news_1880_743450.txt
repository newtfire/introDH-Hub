In accordance with the mysterious law of the Anglo-Saxon nature which forbids a man to indulge in any particular sport unless he can induce several other men to join him , the bicycle-riders have held a convention and organized a national club . The bicycle convention at Newport is to be followed later in the season by a canoe convention at Lake George , where a national canoe club is to be organized . The success of the Newport gathering ought to put the canoe men on their mettle anal fill them with a determination to show that canoeing is at least as popular in this country as it is in England . It is a national characteristic of the Englishman that he regards no athletic , open-air sport as worthy of the name unless it involves a good deal of danger and a fair amount of physical misery . These conditions are fully met by bicycling and canoeing , it being always remembered that the canoe of Christian nations has nothing whatever in common with the birch canoe of the North American heathen . In adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miseries pertaining to each , and a rivalry in. suffering is rapidly springing up between the bicyclists and the canoeists . At present these two classes of athletic martyrs are nearly equal in numbers , but whichever class can display the more imposing list of casualties . or can achieve the greater amount of misery will gain the first place in the estimation of lovers of open-air sports . . Beyond any doubt , the bicycle breaks more bones than the canoe . The bicycle is cheaper , more enduring , and far more fascinating i than the horse , but it is much more vicious . It is liable at any moment to throw its rider and to break him to a greater or less extent . Usually , its fiendish instincts are satisfied with the breakage of a nose or a finger , but it is very apt to break legs , heads , and even necks . The utmost skill can not guard the bicyclist against this always threatening danger . In spite of the romance and adventures which a bicycle journey affords , cautious people prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. TENNYSON meant to express when he remarked that for his part he had rather have- " Fifty years of Europe Than a bicycle of Cathay , " using " Europe " and " Cathay " as the synonyms of prose and romance . While the bicyclist can point with pride and a crippled finger to his broken nose , to his crutches , or to the sling in which he carries his broken arm , it must be confessed that the canoeist can only show a few blisters on his hands , and hint at the existence of others . Canoeing does not break bones , except in very rare instances . Of course , if , in running a rapid , the canoe strikes , and the canoeist jumps overboard on the wrong side , the canoe may throw herself against a leg with sufficient violence to scrape it to a most delightful extent , but the leg is in little danger of breakage . Among every hundred bicyclists it is estimated that during a given season there will be broken eleven fingers , two legs , and five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and + , per cent . of necks . Among an equal number of canoeists there will be in all not more than seven abraded legs , and no broken bones whatever . Thus , in point of breakages , the bicyclists have a very large advantage over the canoeists . The canoeist , however , is liable to be drowned , and although only one-eighth of 1 per cent . of all English and American canoeists have yet been drowned , this possibility of drowning is something which the most boastful bicyclist must admit is beyond his reach . But the moment we come to compare the misery of canoeing with the misery of bicycling , the superiority of the former is seen to be enormous . The bicyclist undergoes a few unimportant cramps , but with that exception he does not know what real misery is . While the canoeist cooks his own wretched meals and burns his unhappy fingers , the bicyclist stops at a comfortable hotel and eats what Western statesmen call a " square meal . " During the day the canoeist is constantly getting wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bicyclist is dry , and can , if he chooses , protect himself from the sun . At night , while the bicyclist is reveling in the loathsome luxury of a bed at the hotel , the canoeist is trying to sleep in his canoe , with a hard board for his bed , and the mosquitoes singing his lullaby . The average canoeist is rarely able to move his cramped legs on awaking in the morning , and has to drag ' himself out of his canoe with groans and execrations , but the bicyclist is called from a spring mattress rested and ready for a ' comfortable breakfast . There is probably no athletic sport in the world which can for a moment be compared with canoeing in the wide variety and bitter torture of the physical miseries which it entails , and all fair-minded bicyclists must , however reluctantly , admit that this is true . When we consider the greater dangers of bicycling and the supreme suffering of canoeing , we can not readily decide which of the two is the more enticing sport . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist upon regarding the other as inferior to it . When the public , however , sees the canoe regatta on Lake George , and notes the percentage of wet and cramped canoeists , there can be no doubt that the vast superiority of canoeing over bicycling will be enthusiastically recognized by the spectators .
