Georgia O'Keeffe , one of the great modern U.S. artists , is having her first retrospective museum show-not at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , but at Chicago 's Art Institute . <P> The Institute 's 61 paintings covering the 28 years of Georgia O'Keeffe 's painting life , are a superb catalogue . They include the abstractions , the giant flowers , trees , shells , bones , skulls and landscapes which once caused the New York Sun 's Critic Henry McBride to remark that only Georgia O'Keeffe could " so hush up a bunch of lady art connoisseurs and make them go whispering on tiptoes about a gallery . " O'Keeffe 's huge flowers include jack-in-the-pulpits , hollyhocks , larkspur , the 3-by-2-ft . Black Iris , which the Institute 's Art Director Daniel Catton Rich described as an example of the Artist 's means of " conveying her own distinguished emotions . " <P> Says Georgia O'Keeffe of her flower paintings : " I am attempting to express what I saw in a flower which apparently others failed to see . " For years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flowers . Critic Lewis Mumford has seen a celebration of " almost every phase of the erotic experience . " Said he : " Socrates learned about love from the priestess Diotima ; but if he were alive today , he would probably go to O'Keeffe . " Painter Oscar Bluemner has written : " . . . O'Keeffe steps forth as an . . . imaginative biologist of all creation . . . extending perhaps beyond the confines of the human body . " While O'Keeffe admits there is reason for her flowers and landscapes to be considered as symbols of the unconscious , her gigantic Black Cross , New Mexico might suggest extreme asceticism . All of O'Keeffe 's work , utterly original , has graphic cleanliness , economy , purity , a lyric quality suggesting that of Poetess Emily Dickinson . <P> Jet-haired , olive-skinned , hazel-eyed Georgia O'Keeffe was born 55 years ago in Sun Prairie , Wis . Her father was an Irish farmer , her mother was Hungarian . After the family moved to Williamsburg , Va. , in 1901 , Georgia decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at Manhattan 's Art Students League , where she was known as " Patsy . " A winter of painting as her teachers taught it convinced her that she could not paint at all . She worked as a commercial artist in Chicago , a public-school art supervisor in Amarillo , Tex . She calls Texas " the only place I ever felt really at home . " <P> In 1916 O'Keeffe decided she was " a very stupid fool " not to paint just as she wished , sent a roll of sketches to a friend in Manhattan on the " express condition that they were not to be shown to anyone . " The friend promptly showed them to Dealer Alfred Stieglitz ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) . He gave an exhibition of O'Keeffe in his " 291 " gallery , persuaded her to devote all her time to painting , married her eight years later . Her first sale brought $400 . In 1928 she got $25,000 for five paintings of lilies . She once sold a single picture for $10,000 , but does not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
