The surveys ' story sounded both sweet and sour to Barry Goldwater . <P> Since last summer , Goldwater has steadily lengthened his lead over Nelson Rockefeller in presidential preference polls . Last week the Gallup poll reported that since its last canvass in October , Goldwater has stepped out even farther ahead of Rocky among Republican voters .

The statistics among Republicans : <P> October Now <P> Goldwater 42% 45% <P> Rockefeller 26% 23% <P> Romney 15% 16% <P> An Associated Press poll found Goldwater the overwhelming favorite among G.O.P. state and county leaders .

" <P> Lubell 's explanation : with the easing of cold war tensions , the public now views civil rights strife rather than the struggle with the Soviets as the U.S. 's No. 1 political issue . " Interviews in five Eastern states , * where Kennedy should be at his strongest , " wrote Lubell , " show him losing a tenth of his 1960 support-mainly because ' he gives in too much to the Negro .
