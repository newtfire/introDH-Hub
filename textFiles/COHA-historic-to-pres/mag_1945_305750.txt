The shrew-the animal namesake of bad-tempered women-is the smallest but fiercest and most voraciously carnivorous of all mammals . The brown , beady-eyed , two-to four-inch creature looks like a tiny , sharp-nosed field mouse , and lives under logs , leaves , roots and grasses in the woodlands of America , Asia and Europe . Last week Cornell 's Zoology Professor William Robert Eadie ( now a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy ) made known some new facts about this diminutive killer . <P> Unrelated to the rodent family and far from mouselike in its habits , the shrew is properly an insect eater . But , declared Eadie , the shrew rarely behaves properly : in 56% of shrews ' nests he examined there was direct evidence that the occupants had been feeding largely on field mice . " Circumstantial evidence , " he added darkly , " points to a higher figure . " Field mouse population of meadows near the experiment dropped from 80 to twelve mice per acre . <P> Unlike the human variety , whose shrill voice it shares , the shrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestion : So rapid are its metabolic processes that a shrew will starve to death in a matter of hours if it does not keep eating . If two shrews are caged together overnight , only the stronger will be found a perpetual state of nervous tension . So touchy are they that when a fox or a weasel , probably mistaking the rank-smelling shrew for a field mouse , lays a predatory paw on it , the shrew usually expires from shock .
