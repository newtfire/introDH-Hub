CHARCOAL SKETCHES ; OR , SCENES IN A METROPOLIS . BY JOSEPH C. NEAL . WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY DAVID C. JOHNSTON . PHILADELPHIA : E. L. CAREY AND A. HART . 1838 . Acknowledgment Entered according to Act of Congress , in the year 1837 , by E. L. Carey &; A. Hart , in the Clerk 's Office of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania . STEREOTYPED BY L. JOHNSON , PHILADELPHIA . PHILADELPHIA . PRINTED BY T. K. AND P. G. COLLINS . INTRODUCTION . Among the publications of late years , we have Pencil Sketches , Crayon Sketches , Pen and Ink Drawings , Pencillings by the Way , and other works deriving their titles from the pursuits of the draughtsman . To avoid plagiarism , therefore , while following the fashion , this humble volume is presented bearing the unambitious name which heads its pages . There is certainly nothing very imposing about it ; but charcoal has its uses and its capabilities ; and the sketcher is content if he has been able even to approach any of the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article so homely . A number of the trifles contained in the volume are familiar to newspaper readers , under the general title of " City Worthies . " Although mere fancy portraits , farcical in their nature , and written for a temporary purpose , they were received with such unexpected favour as to induce their publication in the present form . The collection also comprises other sketches which at least have novelty on their side , if " worthy " of no other credit . But whether the letter-press be amusing or not , the illustrations by Johnston are replete with humour and graphic skill . They who yawn in the perusal of our pages , can therefore turn for refreshment to the comicalities of the etcher , and excuse the dulness perpetrated by the pen , in laughing over the quaint characteristics embodied by our American Cruikshank . Trusting that some portion of the Charcoal Sketches may be well received , they are now committed to the reader . If he will not smile , the writer has laboured in vain ; and if he frown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and to borrow a hint from the familiar story of the painter who was advised to place beneath his pictures the name of the object he wished to represent , it may not be amiss to state that these productions involve a design upon the risibles of the " pensive public . " Should there be a failure in our deep intent , it adds another to the long list of cases wherein the will has been unable to achieve the deed . CONTENTS .

OLYMPUS PUMP ; OR , THE POETIC TEMPERAMENT . It is said that poetry is on the decline , and that as man surrounds himself with artificial comforts , and devotes his energies to purposes of practical utility , the sphere of imagination becomes circumscribed , and the worship of the Muses is neglected . We are somewhat disposed to assent to this conclusion ; the more from having remarked the fact that the true poetic temperament is not so frequently met with as it was a few years since , and that the outward marks of genius daily become more rare . Where the indications no longer exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to conclude that the thing itself is perishing . There are , it is true , many delightful versifiers at the present moment , but we fear that though they display partial evidences of inspiration upon paper , the scintillations are deceptive . Their conduct seldom exhibits sufficient proof that they are touched with the celestial fire , to justify the public in regarding them as the genuine article . Judging from the rules formerly considered absolute upon this point , it is altogether preposterous for your happy , well-behaved , well-dressed , smoothly-shaved gentleman , who pays his debts , and submits quietly to the laws framed for the government of the uninspired part of society , to arrogate to himself a place in the first rank of the sons of genius , whatever may be his merits with the gray goose quill . There is something defective about him . The divine afflatus has been denied , and though he may flap his wings , and soar as high as the house-tops , no one can think him capable of cleaving the clouds , and of playing hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , the spectator would either believe that his eyes deceived him , or that the successful flight was accidental , and owing rather to a temporary density of the atmosphere than to a strength of pinion . The true poetic temperament of the old school is a gift as fatal , as that of being able to sing a good song is to a youth with whom the exercise of the vocal organ is not a profession . It was  --  and to a certain extent is  --  an axiom , that an analogy almost perfect exists between the poet and the dolphin . To exhibit their beautiful hues they must both be on the broad road to destruction . We are fully aware that it has been supposed by sceptical spirits that there is some confusion of cause and effect in arriving at this conclusion ,  --  that there is no sufficient reason that genius should be a bad citizen . The existence of an irresistible impulse to break the shackles of conventionalism has been doubted by the heterodox . They declare that a disposition to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indulged in , partly from a principle of imitation , because certain shining lights have thought proper to render themselves as conspicuous for their eccentricities as for their genius , and chiefly from a belief that society expects such wanderings , and regards them with lenity . But analysis is not our forte , even if we were disposed to cavil at such convenient things as lumping generalities . Your inquiring philosophers are troublesome fellows , and while we content ourselves with the bare fact , let them seek rerum cognoscere causas . It is , however , a satisfaction to know that the full-blooded merino is not yet quite extinct . Olympus Pump is the personification of the temperament of which we speak . Had there been a little less of the divine essence of poesy mingled with the clay of which he is composed , it would have been better for him . The crockery of his moral constitution would have been the more adapted to the household uses of this kitchen world . But Pump delights in being the pure porcelain , and would scorn the admixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render him more useful , would diminish his ornamental qualities . He proudly feels that he was intended to be a mantel embellishment to bear bouquets , not a mere utensil for the scullery ; and that he is not now fulfilling his destiny , arises solely from the envy and uncharitableness of those gross and malignant spirits with which the world abounds . Occupied continually in his mental laboratory , fabricating articles which he finds unsaleable , and sometimes stimulating his faculties with draughts of Scheidam , the " true Hippocrene , " he slips from station to station , like a child tumbling down stairs ; and now , having arrived at the lowest round of fortune 's ladder , he believes it was envy that tugged at his coat tails , and caused his descent , and that the human race are a vast band of conspirators . There are no Mcenases in these modern times to help those who will not help themselves ; no , not even a Capel Lofft , to cheer the Pumps of the nineteenth century . No kindly arm toils at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump for himself . Such , at least , is the conclusion at which Olympus has arrived , and he has melancholy reasons for believing that in his instance he is correct . Thus , while his mind is clothing its varied fancies in rich attire , and his exulting spirit is gambolling and luxuriating in the clover and timothy of imagination 's wide domain , or drinking fairy Champagne and eating canvass-back ducks in air-drawn palaces , his outward man is too frequently enduring the sad reverse of these unreal delights . He may often be seen , when the weather is cold , leaning his back against a post on the sunny side of the street ; his hands , for lack of coin , filling his roomy pockets ; his curious toes peeping out at crannies to see the world ; an indulgence extended to them by few but the Pump family ; and his elbows and knees following the example of his lower extremities . Distress , deep thought , or some other potent cause has transplanted the roses from the garden of his cheek to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows just such a stubble as would be invaluable for the polishing brush of a boot-black . But luckily the poetic temperament has its compensations . When not too much depressed , Olympus Pump has a world of his own within his cranium ; a world which should be a model for that without ,  --  a world in which there is nothing to do , and every thing to get for the asking . If in his periods of intellectual abstraction , the external atmosphere should nip his frame , the high price of coal affects him not . In the palace of the mind , fuel costs nothing , and he can there toast himself brown free of expense . Does he desire a tea-party ?  --  the guests are in his noddle at his call , willing to stay , or ready to depart , at his command , without " standing on the order of their going ; " and the imagined tables groan with viands which wealth might exhaust itself to procure . Does he require sweet music ?  --  the poetic fancy can perform an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkling of an eye ; and the celestial creatures , who waltz and galope in the spacious salons of his brain-pan , are endowed with loveliness which reality can never parallel . With such advantages , Pump , much as he grumbles , would not exchange the coruscations of his genius , which flicker and flare like the aurora borealis , for a " whole wilderness " of comfort , if it were necessary that he should entertain dull , plodding thoughts , and make himself " generally useful . " Can he not , while he warms his fingers at the fire of imagination , darm his stockings and patch his clothes with the needle of his wit ; wash his linen and his countenance in the waters of Helicon ; and , sitting on the peak of Parnassus , devour imaginary fried oysters with Apollo and the Muses ? But either " wool gathering " is not very profitable , or else the envy of which Pump complains is stronger than ever ; for not long since , after much poetic idleness , and a protracted frolic , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on a stall in the new market house , for the very sufficient reason that he did not exactly know where else lodging proportioned to the state of his fiscal department could be found . He spoke : " How blue ! how darkly , deeply , beautifully blue !  --  not me myself , but the expanse of ether . The stars wink through the curtain of the air , like a fond mother to her drowsy child , as much as to say hush-a-by-baby to a wearied world . In the moon 's mild rays even the crags of care like sweet rock-candy shine . Night is a Carthagenian Hannibal to sorrow , melting its Alpine steeps , whilst buried hope pops up revived and cracks its rosy shins . Day may serve to light sordid man to his labours ; it may be serviceable to let calabashes and squashes see how to grow ; but the poetic soul sparkles beneath the stars . Genius never feels its oats until after sunset ; twilight applies the spanner to the fireplug of fancy to give its bubbling fountains way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart , and cries , Pass on the water ! ' Yes , and economically considered , night is this world 's Spanish cloak ; for no matter how dilapidated or festooned one 's apparel may be , the loops and windows can not be discovered , and we look as elegant and as beautiful as get out . Ah ! " continued Pump , as he gracefully reclined upon the stall , " it 's really astonishing how rich I am in the idea line to-night . But it 's no use . I 've got no pencil  --  not even a piece of chalk to write ' em on my hat for my next poem . It 's a great pity ideas are so much of the soap-bubble order , that you ca n't tie ' em up in a pocket handkerchief , like a half peck of potatoes , or string ' em on a stick like catfish . I often have the most beautiful notions scampering through my head with the grace , but alas ! the swiftness too , of kittens  --  especially just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the want of a trap ; an intellectual figgery four . I wish we could find out the way of sprinkling salt on their tails , and make ' em wait till we want to use ' em . Why ca n't some of the meaner souls invent an idea catcher for the use of genius ? I 'm sure they 'd find it profitable , for I would n't mind owing a man twenty dollars for one myself . Oh , for an idea catcher ! " Owen Glendower failed in calling up spirits , but the eloquence of Pump was more efficacious . In the heavy shadow of a neighbouring pile of goods a dark mass appeared to detach itself , as if a portion of the gloom had suddenly become animated . It stepped forth in the likeness of a man , mysteriously wrapped up , whose eyes glared fiercely , and with a sinister aspect , as he advanced towards the poet . Pump stared in silence  --  he felt like an idea , and as if the catcher were close at hand , ready to pounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a disagreeable operation . The parties confronted each other for a time without saying a word . A cloud hurrying across the moon lent additional terror to the scene , and the unknown , to Pump 's astonished vision , appeared to swell to a supernatural size . The stranger , at last , waved his arm , hemmed thrice , and in the deep , decisive tones of one used to command , said : " It 's not a new case  --  it 's been decided frequent . It 's clearly agin the ordination made and provided , and it 's likewise agin the act "  --  " Ah me ! what act ? " ejaculated the astonished Pump . " To fetch yourself to anchor on the stalls . It is n't what the law considers pooty behaviour , and no gemman would be cotched at it . To put the case , now , would it be genteel for a man to set on the table at dinner-time ? Loafing on the stalls is jist as bad as rolling among the dishes . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions ; I 'm holding sweet communion with my own desolate affections . Leave me , leave me to the luxuriance of imagination ; suffer me , as it were , to stray through the glittering realms of fancy . " " What ! on a mutton butcher 's shambles ? Bless you , I ca n't think of it for a moment . My notions is rigid , and if I was to find my own daddy here , I 'd rouse him out . You must tortle off , as fast as you kin . If your tongue was n't so thick , I 'd say you must mosey ; but moseying is only to be done when a gemman 's half shot ; when they 're gone cases , we do n't expect ' em to do more nor tortle . " " Excuse me  --  I do n't see that it makes much difference to you whether I am qualified to mosey , or am only capable of the more dignified method of locomotion , which you call to tortle . But do n't disturb me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I would shortly compose an ode to Nox and Erebus . " " Compose what 's owed to Messrs . Nox and Erebus ! Yes , I thought you were one of that sort what makes compositions when they owe any thing . Precious little Nox and Erebus will get out of you . But come , hop the twig ! " So saying , the relentless guardian of the night seized the hapless Pump by the collar , and began to remove him . " Now , do n't  --  do n't be gross and muscular . I 'm an oppressed man , with no friend but my coat , and both my coat and myself are remarkable for fragility of constitution . We are free souls , vibrating on the breath of the circumambient atmosphere , and by long companionship , our sympathies are so perfect , that if you pull hard you 'll produce a pair of catastrophes ; while you tear the one , you 'll discombobberate the nerves of the other . " " Well , I 'm be blamed ! " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes of that ? Why , aunty , ai n't you a noncompusser ? " " I 'm a poet , and it 's my fate not to be understood either by the world in general , or by Charleys in particular . The one knocks us down , and the others take us up . Between the two , we are knocked about like a ball , until we become unravelled , and perish . " " I do n't want to play shinney with you , no how  --  why do n't you go home ? " " The bottle is empty ; the bill unpaid ; landlords are vulgar realities  --  mere matters of fact  --  and very apt to vituperate . " " Well , it 's easy enough to work , get money , fill the bottle , and pay the gemman what you owes him . " " I tell you again you ca n't understand the poetic soul . It can not endure the scorn and contumelies of the earthly . It can not submit to toil under a taskmaster , and when weaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spry and ' tend the shop . Nor , when it meets congenial spirits , can it leave the festive board , because the door is to be locked at ten o'clock , and there is n't any dead latch to it . The delicate excesses into which it leads us , to repair the exhaustion of hard thought , compel us to sojourn long in bed , and even that is registered by fip-and-levy boobies as a sin . At the present moment , I am falling a victim to these manifold oppressions of the unintellectual . " " Under the circumstances , then , what do you say to being tuck up ? " " Is it optional ? " " I do n't know ; but it 's fineable , and that 's as good . " " Then I decline the honour . " " No , you do n't . I only axed out of manners . You must rise up , William Riley , and come along with me , as the song says . " " I suppose I must , whether I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poetic temperament ! Must the olian harp of genius be so rudely swept by a Charley  --  must that harp , as I may say , play mere banjo jigs , when it should only respond in Lydian measures to the southern breezes of palpitating imagination ? To what base uses "  --  " Hurrah ! Keep a toddling  --  pull foot and away ! " Olympus obeyed ; for who can control his fate ? ' T IS ONLY MY HUSBAND . 1 " Goodness , Mrs. Pumpilion , it 's a gentleman 's voice , and me such a figure ! " exclaimed Miss Amanda Corntop , who had just arrived in town to visit her friend , Mrs. Pumpilion , whom she had not seen since her marriage . " Do n't disturb yourself , dear , " said Mrs. Pumpilion , quietly , " it 's nobody  --  ' t is only my husband . He 'll not come in ; but if he does , ' t is only my husband . " So Miss Amanda Corntop was comforted , and her agitated arrangements before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and the interrupted conversation . Although , as a spinster , she had a laudable and natural unwillingness to be seen by any of the masculine gender in that condition so graphically described as " such a figure , " yet there are degrees in this unwillingness . It is by no means so painful to be caught a figure by a married man as it is to be surprised by a youthful bachelor ; and , if the former be of that peculiar class known as " only my husband , " his unexpected arrival is of very little consequence . He can never more , " like an eagle in a dove cote , flutter the Volsces . " It is , therefore , evident that there exists a material difference between " my husband " and " only my husband ; " a difference not easily expressed , though perfectly understood ; and it was that understanding which restored Miss Amanda Corntop to her pristine tranquillity . " Oh ! " said Miss Corntop , when she heard that the voice in question was that of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligently and composedly , when she understood that Pumpilion was " only my husband . " She had not paid much attention to philology , but she was perfectly aware of the value of that diminutive prefix " only . " " I told you he would not come in , for he knew there was some one here , " continued Mrs. Pumpilion , as the spiritless footsteps of " only my husband " passed the door , and slowly plodded up stairs . He neither came in , nor did he hum , whistle , or bound three steps at a time ; " only my husband " never does . He is simply a transportation line ; he conveys himself from place to place according to order , and indulges not in episodes and embellishments . Poor Pedrigo Pumpilion ! Have all thy glories shrunk to this little measure ? Only my husband ! Does that appellation circumscribe him who once found three chairs barely sufficient to accommodate his frame , and who , in promenading , never skulked to the curb or hugged the wall , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very middle of the trottoir , and kept it ? The amiable , but now defunct , Mrs. Anguish was never sure that she was perfectly well , until she had shaken her pretty head to ascertain if some disorder were not lying in ambush , and to discover whether a headache were not latent there , which , if not nipped in the bud , might be suddenly and inconveniently brought into action . It is not too much to infer that the same reasoning , which applies to headaches and to the physical constitution , may be of equal force in reference to the moral organization . Headaches being latent , it is natural to suppose that the disposition to be " only my husband " may likewise be latent , even in him who is now as fierce and as uncontrollable as a volcano ; while the desire to be " head of the bureau " may slumber in the mildest of the fair . It is by circumstance alone that talent is developed ; the razor itself requires extraneous aid to bring it to an edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the facility to obey , wait to be elicited by events . Both grey-mareism and Jerry-Sneakery are sometimes latent , and like the derangements of Mrs. Anguish 's caput , only want shaking to manifest themselves . If some are born to command , others must certainly have a genius for submission  --  we term it a genius , submission being in many cases rather a difficult thing . That this division of qualities is full of wisdom , none can deny . It requires both flint and steel to produce a spark ; both powder and ball to do execution ; and , though the Chinese contrive to gobble an infinity of rice with chopsticks , yet the twofold operation of knife and fork conduces much more to the comfort of a dinner . Authority and obedience are the knife and fork of this extensive banquet , the world ; they are the true divide et impera ; that which is sliced off by the one is harpooned by the other . In this distribution , however , nature , when the " latents " are made apparent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means rare to find in the form of a man , a timid , retiring , feminine disposition , which , in the rough encounters of existence , gives way at once , as if , like woman , " born to be controlled . " The proportions of a Hercules , valenced with the whiskers of a tiger , often cover a heart with no more of energy and boldness in its pulsations than the little palpitating affair which throbs in the bosom of a maiden of bashful fifteen ; while many a lady fair , before marriage  --  the latent condition  --  all softness and graceful humility , bears within her breast the fiery resolution and the indomitable will of an Alexander , a Hannibal , or a Doctor Francia . The temperament which , had she been a man , would , in an extended field , have made her a conqueror of nations , or , in a more contracted one , a distinguished thief-catching police officer , by being lodged in a female frame renders her a Xantippe  --  a Napoleon of the fireside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , a spiritless captive in his own chimney corner . But it is plain to be seen that this apparent confusion lies only in the distribution . There are souls enough of all kinds in the world , but they do not always seem properly fitted with bodies ; and thus a corporal construction may run the course of life actuated by a spirit in every respect opposed to its capabilities ; as at the breaking up of a crowded soire , a little head waggles home with an immense castor , while a pumpkin pate sallies forth surmounted by a thimble ; which , we take it , is the only philosophical theory which at all accounts for the frequent acting out of character with which society is replete . Hence arises the situation of affairs with the Pumpilions . Pedrigo Pumpilion has the soul which legitimately appertains to his beloved Seraphina Serena , while Seraphina Serena Pumpilion has that which should animate her Pedrigo . But , not being profound in their researches , they are probably not aware of the fact , and perhaps would not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street ; although , in all likelihood , it was a mysterious sympathy  --  a yearning of each physical individuality to be near so important a part of itself , which brought this worthy pair together . Be that , however , as it may , it is an incontrovertible fact that , before they did come together , Pedrigo Pumpilion thought himself quite a model of humanity ; and piqued himself upon possessing much more of the fortiter in re than of the suaviter in modo  --  a mistake , the latter quality being latent , but abundant . He dreamed that he was brimming with valour , and fit , not only to lead squadrons to the field , but likewise to remain with them when they were there . At the sound of drums and trumpets , he perked up his chin , stuck out his breast , straightened his vertebral column , and believed that he , Pedrigo , was precisely the individual to storm a fortress at the head of a forlorn hope  --  a greater mistake . But the greatest error of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seraphina Serena Dolce , with the decided impression that he was , while sharing his kingdom , to remain supreme in authority . Knowing nothing of the theory already broached , he took her for a feminine feminality , and yielded himself a victim to sympathy and the general welfare . Now , in this , strictly considered , Pedrigo had none but himself to blame ; he had seen manifestations of her spirit ; the latent energy had peeped out more than once ; he had entered unexpectedly , before being installed as " only my husband , " and found Miss Seraphina dancing the grand rigadoon on a luckless bonnet which did not suit her fancy ,  --  a species of exercise whereat he marvelled ; and he had likewise witnessed her performance of the remarkable feat of whirling a cat , which had scratched her hand , across the room by the tail , whereby the mirror was infinitesimally divided into homoeopathic doses , and whereby pussy , the patient , was most allopathically phlebotomised and scarified . He likewise knew that her musical education terminated in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience demolished the guitar over the head of her teacher ; but , in this instance , the mitigating plea must be allowed that it was done because the instrument " would n't play good , " a perversity to which instruments , like lessons " which wo n't learn , " are lamentably liable . These little escapades , however , did not deter Pumpilion . Confiding in his own talent for governing , he liked his Seraphina none the less for her accidental displays of energy , and smiled to think how , under his administration , his reproving frown would cast oil upon the waves , and how , as he repressed her irritability , he would develope her affections , results which would both save the crockery and increase his comforts . Of the Pumpilion tactique in courtship some idea may be formed from the following conversation . Pedrigo had an intimate associate , some years his senior ,  --  Mr. Michael Mitts , a spare and emaciated bachelor , whose hawk nose , crookedly set on , well represented the eccentricity of his conclusions , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betokened acidity of mind rendered sourer by indecision . Mitts was addicted to observation , and , engaged in the drawing of inferences and in generalizing from individual instances , he had , like many others , while trimming the safety lamp of experience , suffered the time of action to pass by unimproved . His cautiousness was so great as to trammel up his " motive power , " and , though long intending to marry , the best part of his life had evaporated in the unproductive employment of " looking about . " His experience , therefore , had stored him with that species of wisdom which one meets with in theoretical wooers , and he had many learned saws at the service of those who were bolder than himself , and were determined to enter the pale through which he peeped . As every one in love must have a confidant , Pedrigo had selected Mitts for that office , knowing his peculiar talent for giving advice , and laying down rules for others to act upon . " Pedrigo , " said Mitts , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity to the usages of the world , and slacked the drawing strings of his mouth to get it out of pucker ; " Pedrigo , if you are resolved upon marrying this identical individual  --  I do n't see the use , for my part , of being in a hurry  --  better look about a while ; plenty more of ' em  --  but if you are resolved , the first thing to be done is to make sure of her . That 's undeniable . The only difference of opinion , if you wo n't wait and study character  --  character 's a noble study  --  is as to the modus operandi . Now , the lady 's not sure because she 's committed ; just the contrary ,  --  that 's the very reason she 's not sure . My experience shows me that when it 's not so easy to retract , the attention , especially that of young women , is drawn to retraction . Somebody tells of a bird in a cage that grumbled about being cooped up . It 's clear to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the cage , as it did because it could n't get out  --  that 's bird nature , and it 's human nature too . " " Ah , indeed ! " responded Pumpilion , with a smile of confidence in his own attractions , mingled , however , with a look which spoke that the philosophy of Mitts , having for its object to render " assurance double sure , " did not pass altogether unheeded . " It 's a fact , " added Mitts ; " do n't be too secure . Be as assiduous and as mellifluous as you please before your divinity owns the soft impeachment ; but afterwards comes the second stage , and policy commands that it should be one rather of anxiety to her . You must every now and then play Captain Grand , or else she may perform the part herself . Take offence frequently ; vary your Romeo scenes with an occasional touch of the snow storm , and afterwards excuse yourself on the score of jealous affection ; that excuse always answers . Nothing sharpens love like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself would not look so bright if it were not for the intervention of night ; and these little agitations keep her mind tremulous , but intent upon yourself . Do n't mothers always love the naughtiest boys best ? have n't the worst men always the best wives ? That exemplifies the principle ; there 's nothing like a little judicious bother . Miss Seraphina Serena will never change her mind if bothered scientifically . " " Perhaps so ; but may it not be rather dangerous ? " " Dangerous ! not at all ; it 's regular practice , I tell you . A few cases may terminate unluckily ; but that must be charged to a bungle in the doctor . Why , properly managed , a courtship may be continued , like a nervous disease , or a suit at law , for twenty years , and be as good at the close as it was at the beginning . In nine cases out of ten , you must either perplex or be perplexed ; so you had better take the sure course , and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker , " and Michael Mitts caused his lithe proboscis to oscillate like a rudder , as he concluded his oracular speech , and puckered his mouth to the whistling place to show that he had " shut up " for the present . He then walked slowly away , leaving Pumpilion with a " new wrinkle . " Seraphina Serena , being both fiery and coquettish withal , Pumpilion , under the direction of his preceptor , tried the " Mitts system of wooing , " and although it gave rise to frequent explosions , yet the quarrels , whether owing to the correctness of the system or not , were productive of no lasting evil . Michael Mitts twirled his nose and twisted his mouth in triumph at the wedding ; and set it down as an axiom that there is nothing like a little insecurity for rendering parties firm in completing a bargain ; that , had it not been for practising the system , Pumpilion might have become alarmed at the indications of the " latent spirit ; " and that , had it not been for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have strayed . " I 'm an experimenter in mental operations , and there 's no lack of subjects , " said Mitts to himself ; " one fact being established , the Pumpilions now present a new aspect . " There is , however , all the difference in the world between carrying on warfare where you may advance and retire at pleasure , and in prosecuting it in situations which admit of no retreat . Partisan hostilities are one thing , and regular warfare is another . Pumpilion was very well as a guerilla , but his genius in that respect was unavailing when the nature of the campaign did not admit of his making an occasional demonstration , and of evading the immediate consequences by a retreat . In a very few weeks , he was reduced to the ranks as " only my husband , " and , although no direct order of the day was read to that effect , he was " respected accordingly . " Before that retrograde promotion took place , Pedrigo Pumpilion cultivated his hair , and encouraged its sneaking inclination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his locks became broken-heartedly pendent , and straight with the weight of care , while his whiskers hung back as if asking counsel and comfort from his ears . He twiddled his thumbs with a slow rotary motion as he sat , and he carried his hands clasped behind him as he walked , thus intimating that he could n't help it , and that he did n't mean to try . For the same reason , he never buttoned his coat , and wore no straps to the feet of his trousers ; both of which seemed too energetically resolute for " only my husband . ' Even his hat , as it sat on the back part of his head , looked as if Mrs. Pumpilion had put it on for him , ( no one but the wearer can put on a hat so that it will sit naturally , ) and as if he had not nerve enough even to shake it down to its characteristic place and physiognomical expression . His personnel loudly proclaimed that the Mitts method in matrimony had been a failure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Pumpilion had been triumphant in acting upon the advice of her friend , the widow , who , having the advantage of Mitts in combining experience with theory , understood the art of breaking husbands merveille . " My dear madam , " said Mrs. Margery Daw , " you have plenty of spirit ; but spirit is nothing without steadiness and perseverance . In the establishment of authority and in the assertion of one 's rights , any intermission before success is complete requires us to begin again . If your talent leads you to the weeping method of softening your husband 's heart , you will find that if you give him a shower now and a shower then , he will harden in the intervals between the rain ; while a good sullen cry of twenty-four hours ' length may prevent any necessity for another . If , on the contrary , you have genius for the tempestuous , continued thunder and lightning for the same length of time is irresistible . Gentlemen are great swaggerers , if not impressively dealt with and early taught to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued the widow , addressing her lap-dog . " If they bark , and you draw back frightened , they are sure to bite ; stamp your foot , and they soon learn to run into a corner . Do n't they , Frisky dear ? " " Ya-p ! " responded the dog : and Mrs. Pumpilion , tired of control , took the concurrent advice . " To-morrow , " said Pumpilion , carelessly and with an of-course-ish air , as he returned to tea from a stroll with his friend Michael Mitts , who had just been urging upon him the propriety of continuing the Mitts method after marriage , " to-morrow , my love , I leave town for a week to try a little trout fishing in the mountains . " " Mr. Pumpilion ! " ejaculated the lady , in an awful tone , as she suddenly faced him . " Fishing ? " " Y-e-e-yes , " replied Pumpilion , somewhat discomposed . " Then I shall go with you , Mr. Pumpilion , " said the lady , as she emphatically split a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with decisive stress upon the first syllable ; " it 's a buck party , if I may use the expression  --  a back party entirely ;  --  there 's Mike Mitts , funny Joe Mungoozle  --  son of old Mungoozle 's ,  --  Tommy Titcomb , and myself . We intend having a rough and tumble among the hills to beneficialise our wholesomes , as funny Joe Mungoozle has it . " " Funny Joe Mungoozle is not a fit companion for any married man , Mr. Pumpilion ; and it 's easy to see , by your sliding back among the dissolute friends and dissolute practices of your bachelorship , Mr. Pumpilion  --  by your wish to associate with sneering and depraved Mungoozles , Mitts 's , and Titcombs , Mr. Pumpilion , that the society of your poor wife is losing its attractions , " and Mrs. Pumpilion sobbed convulsively at the thought . " I have given my word to go a fishing , " replied Pedrigo , rather ruefully , " and a fishing I must go . What would Mungoozle say ?  --  why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at the free and easies . " ' " What matter ? let him say  --  let him sing . But it 's not my observations  --  it 's those of funny Joe Mungoozle that you care for  --  the affections of the free and easy ' carousers that you are afraid of losing . " " Mungoozle is a very particular friend of mine , Seraphina , " replied Pedrigo , rather nettled . " We 're going a fishing  --  that 's flat ! " " Without me ? " " Without you ,  --  it being a buck party , without exception . " Mrs. Pumpilion gave a shriek , and falling back , threw out her arms fitfully  --  the tea-pot went by the board , as she made the tragic movement . " Wretched , unhappy woman ! " gasped Mrs. Pumpilion , speaking of herself . Pedrigo did not respond to the declaration , but alternately eyed the fragments of the tea-pot and the untouched muffin which remained on his plate . The coup had not been without its effect ; but still he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fishing . " " It 's clear you wish to kill me  --  to break my heart , " muttered the lady in a spasmodic manner . " ' Pon my soul , I do n't  --  I 'm only going a fishing . " " I shall go distracted ! " screamed Mrs. Pumpilion , suiting the action to the word , and springing to her feet in such a way as to upset the table , and roll its contents into Pedrigo 's lap , who scrambled from the debris , as his wife , with the air of the Pythoness , swept rapidly round the room , whirling the ornaments to the floor , and indulging in the grand rigadoon upon their sad remains . " You no longer love me , Pedrigo ; and without your love what is life ? What is this , or this , or this , " continued she , a crash following every word , " without mutual affection ?  --  Going a fishing ! " " I do n't know that I am , " whined Pumpilion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened that there were no clouds visible on the occasion , except in the domestic atmosphere ; but , the rain was adroitly thrown in as a white flag , indicative of a wish to open a negotiation and come to terms . Mrs. Pumpilion , however , understood the art of war better than to treat with rebels with arms in their hands . Her military genius , no longer " latent , " whispered her to persevere until she obtained a surrender at discretion . " Ah , Pedrigo , you only say that to deceive your heart-broken wife . You intend to slip away  --  you and your Mungoozles  --  to pass your hours in roaring iniquity , instead of enjoying the calm sunshine of domestic peace , and the gentle delights of fireside felicity . They are too tame , too flat , too insipid for a depraved taste . That I should ever live to see the day ! " and she relapsed into the intense style by way of a specimen of calm delight . Mr. and Mrs. Pumpilion retired for the night at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of reproach , now passionate , now pathetic , ceased not ; and in the very gray of the morning , Mrs. P. marched down stairs en dishabille , still repeating ejaculations about the Mungoozle fishing party . What happened below is not precisely ascertained ; but there was a terrible turmoil in the kitchen , it being perfectly clear a whole " kettle of fish " was in preparation , that Pedrigo might not have the trouble of going to the mountains on a piscatorial expedition . He remained seated on the side of the bed , like Marius upon the ruins of Carthage , meditating upon the situation of affairs , and balancing between a surrender to petticoat government and his dread of Mongoozle 's song at the " free and easies . " At length he slipped down . Mrs. Pumpilion sat glooming at the parlour window . Pedrigo tried to read the " Saturday News " upside down . " Good morning , Mr. Pumpilion ! Going a fishing , Mr. Pumpilion ! Mike Mitts , funny Joe Mungoozle , and Tommy Titcomb must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mocking smile , " you 're to go this morning to the mountains on a rough and tumble for the benefit of your wholesomes . The elegance of the phraseology is quite in character with the whole affair . " Pedrigo was tired out ; Mrs. Margery Daw 's perseverance prescription had been too much for the Mitts method ; the widow had overmatched the bachelor . " No , Seraphina my dearest , I 'm not going a fishing , if you do n't desire it , and I see you do n't . " Not a word about its being likely to rain  --  the surrender was unconditional . " But , " added Pedrigo , " I should like to have a little breakfast . " Mrs. Pumpilion was determined to clinch the nail . " There 's to be no breakfast here  --  I 've been talking to Sally and Tommy in the kitchen , and I verily believe the whole world 's in a plot against me . They 're gone , Mr. Pumpilion  --  gone a fishing , perhaps . " The battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clinched . Tealess , sleepless , breakfastless , what could Pedrigo do but sue for mercy , and abandon a contest waged against such hopeless odds ? The supplies being cut off , the siege-worn garrison must surrender . After hours of solicitation , the kiss of amity was reluctantly accorded ; on condition , however , that " funny Joe Mungoozle " and the rest of the fishing party should be given up , and that he , Pedrigo , for the future should refrain from associating with bachelors and widowers , both of whom she tabooed , and consort with none but staid married men . From this moment the individuality of that once free agent , Pedrigo Pumpilion , was sunk into " only my husband "  --  the humblest of all humble animals . He fetches and carries , goes errands , and lugs band-boxes and bundles ; he walks the little Pumpilions up and down the room when they squall o ' nights , and he never comes in when any of his wife 's distinguished friends call to visit her . In truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mrs. Pumpilion is de facto treasurer , he is kept upon rather short allowance , her wants being paramount and proportioned to the dignity of head of the family . But , although he is now dutiful enough , he at first ventured once or twice to be refractory . These symptoms of insubordination , however , were soon quelled  --  for Mrs. Pumpilion , with a significant glance , inquired ,  --  " Are you going a fishing again , my dear ? " Footnotes It may not be amiss to state that the mere conclusion of the above sketch , hastily thrown off by the same pen , appeared in one of our periodicals a few years ago , and , much mutilated and disfigured , has since been republished in the newspapers , with an erroneous credit , and under a different name . ORSON DABBS , THE HITTITE . It has been said , and truly , that it takes all sorts of people to make a world . He who complains of the lights and shades of character which are eternally flitting before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross his path , has but an illiberal , contracted view of the subject ; and though the Emperor Charles the Fifth , in his retirement at Estremadura , had some reason for being a little annoyed when he could not cause two or three score of watches to go together , yet he was wrong in sighing over his previous ineffectual efforts to make men think alike . It is , to speak figuratively , the clashing which constitutes the music . The harmony of the whole movement is produced by the fusion into each other of an infinite variety of petty discords ; as a glass of punch depends for its excellence upon the skilful commingling of opposing flavours and antagonising materials . Were the passengers in a wherry to be of one mind , they would probably all sit upon the same side , and hence , naturally , pay a visit to the Davy Jones of the river ; and if all the men of a nation thought alike , it is perfectly evident that the ship of state must lose her trim . The system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and without it , affairs would soon hasten to their end . It is , therefore , clear that we must have all sorts of people ,  --  some to prevent stagnation , and others to act as ballast to an excess of animation . The steam engines of humanity must have their breaks and their safety valves , and the dead weights of society require the whip and the spur . Orson Dabbs certainly is entitled to a place among the stimulants of the world , and it is probable that in exercising his impulses , he produces beneficial effects . But it would puzzle a philosopher to designate the wholesome results which follow from his turbulent movements , or to show , either by synthesis or analysis , wherein he is a good . At all events , Orson Dabbs has the reputation of being a troublesome fellow in the circles upon which he inflicts himself ; and , judging from the evidence elicited upon the subject , there is little reason to doubt the fact . He is dogmatical , and to a certain extent fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make converts , he abandons those windy weapons with contempt , and has recourse to more forcible persuaders  --  a pair of fists , each of which looks like a shoulder of mutton . " If people are so obstinate that they wo n't , or so stupid that they ca n't understand you , " observed Dabbs , in one of his confidential moments  --  for Orson Dabbs will sometimes unbend , and suffer those abstruse maxims which govern his conduct to escape  --  " if either for one reason or the other , " continued he , with that impressive iteration which at once gives time to collect and marshal one 's thoughts , and lets the listener know that something of moment is coming  --  " if they wo n't be convinced  --  easily and genteelly convinced  --  you must knock it into ' em short hand ; if they ca n't comprehend , neither by due course of mail , nor yet by express , you must make ' em understand by telegraph . That 's the way I learnt ciphering at school , and manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walloped into me . I took larnin ' through the skin , and sometimes they made a good many holes to get it in . " " And , " timidly interjected an humble admirer of this great man , hazarding a joke , with an insinuating smile ; " and I s'pose you 're so wise now because the hide growed over it , and the larnin ' could n't get out , like Ingey ink in a sailor 's arm . " " Jeames , " replied Orson Dabbs , relaxing into a grim smile , like that of the griffin face of a knocker , and shaking his " bunch of fives " sportively , as one snaps an unloaded gun  --  Napoleon tweaked the ears of his courtiers  --  why should not Dabbs shake his fist at his satellites ?  --  " Jeames , if you do n't bequit poking fun at me , I 'll break your mouth , Jeames , as sure as you sit there . But , to talk sensible , walloping is the only way  --  it 's a panacea for differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that one nation teaches another what it did n't know before by walloping it ; that 's the method of civilizing savages  --  the Romans put the whole world to rights that way ; and what 's right on the big figger must be right on the small scale . In short , there 's nothing like walloping for taking the conceit out of fellows who think they know more than their betters . Put it to ' em strong , and make ' em see out of their eyes . " Orson Dabbs acts up to these golden maxims . Seeing that , from disputes between dogs up to quarrels between nations , fighting is the grand umpire and regulator , he resolves all power into that of the fist ,  --  treating bribery , reason , and persuasion as the means only of those unfortunate individuals to whom nature has denied the stronger attributes of humanity . Nay , he even turns up his nose at betting as a means of discovering truth . Instead of stumping an antagonist by launching out his cash , Dabbs shakes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled ; the recusant must either knock under or be knocked down , which , according to our hero , is all the same in Dutch . In this way , when politics ran high , he used to decide who was to be elected to any specified office ; and he has often boasted that he once , in less than five minutes too , scared a man into giving the Dabbs candidate a large majority , when the unfortunate stranger did not at first believe that the said candidate would be elected at all . Some people believe that the fist is the poorest of arguments , and that it , therefore , should be the last . Here they are completely at issue with Dabbs , and it is well that they do not fall in his way , or he would soon show them the difference . With him it is what action was to the ancient orator , the first , the middle , and the last . Being himself , in a great measure , fist proof , he is very successful in the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straightforward reasoner and a forcible dialectitian . Misfortunes , however , will sometimes happen to the most successful . The loftiest nose may be brought to the grindstone , and the most scornful dog may be obliged to lunch upon dirty pudding . Who can control his fate ? One night Mr. Dabbs came home from his " loafing " place  --  for he " loafs " of an evening , like the generality of people  --  that being the most popular and the cheapest amusement extant ; and , from the way he blurted open the door of the Goose and Gridiron , where he resides , and from the more unequivocal manner in which he slammed it after him , no doubt existed in the minds of his fellow boarders that the well of his good spirits had been " riled ; " or , in more familiar phrase , that he was " spotty on the back . " His hat was pitched forward , with a bloodthirsty , piratical rakishness , and almost covered his eyes , which gleamed like ignited charcoal under a jeweller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his nose  --  always a quarrelsome pug  --  curled more fiercely upward , as if the demon wrath had turned archer , and was using it for a bow to draw an arrow to its head . His mouth had set in opposition to his nasal promontory , and savagely curved downward , like a half-moon battery . Dabbs was decidedly out of sorts  --  perhaps beery , as well as wolfy ; in short , in that unenviable state in which a man feels disposed to divide himself , and go to buffets  --  to kick himself with his own foot  --  to beat himself with his own fist , and to throw his own dinner out of the window . The company were assembled round the fire to discuss politics , literature , men , and things . Dabbs looked not at them , but , slinging Tommy Timid 's bull terrier Oseola out of the arm-chair in the corner , by the small stump of a tail which fashion and the hatchet had left the animal , he sat himself moodily down , with a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a recent brilliant display of the aurora borealis , which the more philosophical of the party supposed to arise from the north pole having become red-hot for want of grease ; while they all joined in deriding the popular fallacy that it was caused by the high price of flour . " Humph ! " said Dabbs , with a grunt , " any fool might know that it was a sign of war . " " War ! " ejaculated the party ; " oh , your granny ! " " Yes , war ! " roared Dabbs , kicking the bull terrier Oseola in the ribs , and striking the table a tremendous blow with his fist , as , with clenched teeth and out-poked head , he repeated , " War ! war ! war ! " Now the Goose and Gridiron fraternity set up for knowing geniuses , and will not publicly acknowledge Page 036 faith in the doctrines on meterology broached by their grandmothers , whatever they may think in private . So they quietly remarked , confiding in their numbers against the Orson Dabbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of war , but an evidence of friction and of no grease on the axle of the world . " That 's a lie ! " shouted Dabbs ; " my story 's the true one , for I read it in an almanac ; and to prove it true , I 'll lick anybody here that do n't believe it , in two cracks of a cow 's thumb . Yes , " added he , in reply to the looks bent upon him ; " I 'll not only wallop them that do n't believe it , but I 'll wallop you all , whether you do or not ! " This , however , was a stretch of benevolence to which the company were not prepared to submit . As Dabbs squared off to proceed secundum artem , according to the approved method of the schools , the watchful astrologer might have seen his star grow pale . He had reached his Waterloo  --  that winter night was his 18th of June . He fell , as many have fallen before him , by that implicit reliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of encountering the long odds . The threat was too comprehensive , and the attempt at execution was a failure . The company cuffed him heartily , and in the fray the bull terrier Oseola vented its cherished wrath by biting a piece out of the fleshiest portion of his frame . Dabbs was ousted by a summary process , but his heart did not fail him . He thundered at the door , sometimes with his fists , and again with whatever missiles were within reach . The barking of the dog and the laughter from within , as was once remarked of certain military heroes , did not " intimate him in the least , it only estimated him . " The noise at last became so great that a watchman finally summoned up resolution enough to come near , and to take Dabbs by the arm . " Let go , watchy !  --  let go , my cauliflower ! Your cocoa is very near a sledge-hammer . If it is n't hard , it may get cracked . " " Pooh ! pooh ! do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation cocoa  --  it belongs to the city , and they 'll get me a new one . Besides , my jewel , there 's two cocoas standing here , you know . Do n't be onasy  --  it may n't be mine that will get cracked . " " I ai n't onasy , " said Dabbs , bitterly , as he turned fiercely round . " I ai n't onasy . I only want to caution you , or I 'll upset your apple cart , and spill your peaches . " " I 'm not in the wegetable way , my own-self , Mr. Horse-radish . You must make less noise . " " Now , look here  --  look at me well , " said Dabbs , striking his fist hard upon his own bosom ; " I 'm a real nine foot breast of a fellow  --  stub twisted and made of horse-shoe nails  --  the rest of me is cast iron with steel springs . I 'll stave my fist right through you , and carry you on my elbow , as easily as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bile me up for soap if I do n't ! " " Ah , indeed ! why , you must be a real Calcutta-from-Canting , warranted not to cut in the eye . Snakes is no touch to you ; but I 'm sorry to say you must knuckle down close . You must surrender ; there 's no help for it  --  none in the world . " " Square yourself then , for I 'm coming ! Do n't you hear the clockvorks ! " exclaimed Dabbs , as he shook off the grip of the officer , and struck an attitude . He stood beautifully ; feet well set ; guard well up ; admirable science , yet fearful to look upon . Like the Adriatic , Dabbs was " lovelily dreadful " on this exciting occasion . But when " Greek meets Greek , " fierce looks and appalling circumstances amount to nothing . The opponent of our hero , after regarding him coolly for a moment , whistled with great contempt , and with provoking composure , beat down his guard with a smart blow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use , no how  --  you 're all used up for bait . " " Ouch ! " shrieked Dabbs ; " my eye , how it hurts ! Do n't hit me again . Ah , good man , but you 're a bruiser . One , two , three , from you would make a person believe any thing , even if he was sure it was n't true . " " Very well , " remarked the macerator , " all I want of you is to behave nice and genteel , and believe you 're going to the watch'us , for it 's true ; and if you do n't believe it yet , why ( shaking his mace ) I shall feel obligated to conwince you again . " As this was arguing with him after his own method , and as Dabbs had distinct impressions of the force of the reasoning , he shrugged his shoulders , and then rubbing his arms , muttered , " Enough said . " He trotted off quietly for the first time in his life . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been somewhat chary of entering into the field of argument , and particularly careful not to drink too much cold water , for fear the bull terrier before referred to was mad , and dreading hydrophobic convulsions . ROCKY SMALT ; OR , THE DANGERS OF IMITATION . Man is an imitative animal , and so strong is the instinctive feeling to follow in the footsteps of others , that he who is so fortunate as to strike out a new path must travel rapidly , if he would avoid being run down by imitators , and preserve the merit of originality . If his discovery be a good one , the " servum pecus " will sweep toward it like an avalanche ; and so quick will be their motion , that the daring spirit who first had the self-reliance to turn from the beaten track , is in danger of being lost among the crowd , and of having his claim to the honours of a discoverer doubted and derided . Turn where you will , the imitative propensity is to be found busily at work ; its votaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarry which the nobler bird has stricken ; and perhaps , like Sir John Falstaff , to deal the prize a " new wound in the thigh , " and falsely claim the wreath of victory . In the useful arts , there are thousands of instances in which the real discoverer has been thrust aside to give place to the imitator ; and in every other branch in which human ingenuity has been exercised , if the flock of copyists do not obtain the patent right of fame , they soon , where it is practicable , wear out the novelty , and measurably deprive the inventor of the consideration to which he is entitled . In the apportionment of applause , the praise too often depends upon which is first seen , the statue or the cast  --  although the one be marble , and the other plaster . In business , no one can hope to recommend his wares to patronage in a new and taking way , no matter what outlay of thought has been required for its invention , without finding multitudes prompt in the adoption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh and verdant path in literature , and is successful , soon hears the murmurs of a pursuing troop , and has his by-way converted into a dusty turnpike , macadamized on the principle of " writing made easy ; " while , on the stage , the drama groans with great ones at second-hand . The illustrious in tragedy can designate an army of those , who , unable to retail their beauties , strive for renown by exaggerating their defects ; and Thalia has even seen her female aids cut off their flowing locks , and teach themselves to wriggle , because she who was in fashion wore a crop , and had adopted a gait after her own fancy . It is to this principle that a professional look is attributable . In striving to emulate the excellence of another , the student thinks he has made an important step if he can catch the air , manner , and tone of his model ; and believes that he is in a fair way to acquire equal wisdom , if he can assume the same expression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nether lip . " We have seen a pupil endeavouring to help himself onward in the race for distinction by wearing a coat similar in cut and colour to that wherewith his preceptor indued himself ; and we remember the time when whole classes at a certain eastern university became a regiment of ugly Dromios , lengthening their visages , and smoothing their hair down to their eyes , for no other reason than that an eminent and popular professor chose to display his frontispiece after that fashion  --  and that , as they emulated his literary abilities , they , therefore , thought it advantageous to imitate his personal defects . When Byron 's fame was in the zenith , poetic scribblers dealt liberally in shirt collar , and sported an expanse of neck ; and when Waterloo heroes were the wonders of the hour , every town in England could show its limpers and hobblers , who , innocent of war , would fain have passed for men damaged by the French . On similar grounds , humps , squints , impediments of speech , mouths awry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could Orson Dabbs , the Hittite , admired and peculiar as he was , both for his ways and for his opinions , hope to escape imitation ? If he entertained such a belief , it was folly ; and if he dreamed that he could so thump the world as to preserve his originality , it was a mere delusion . Among the many who frequented the Goose and Gridiron , where Orson resided , was one Rocky Smalt , whose early admiration for the great one it is beyond the power of words to utter , though subsequent events converted that admiration into hostility . Rocky Smalt had long listened with delight to Orson 's lectures upon the best method of removing difficulties , which , according to him , is by thumping them down , as a paviour smooths the streets ; and as Orson descanted , and shook his fists in exemplification of the text , the soul of Rocky , like a bean in a bottle , swelled within him to put these sublime doctrines in practice . Now , it unluckily happens that Rocky Smalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights  --  which militates somewhat against the gratification of his pugilistic desires , insomuch that if he " squares off " at a big fellow , he is obliged , in dealing a facer , to hit his antagonist on the knee ; and a blow given there , everybody knows , neither " bungs a peeper " nor " taps a smeller . " But Rocky , being to a certain degree aware of his gladiatorial deficiencies , is rather theoretical than practical ; that is , he talks much more than he battles . His narratives , differing from himself , are colossal ; and as Colossus stood with one foot on one side , and with the other foot on the other side , so do Rocky 's speeches refer to the past and to the future  --  to what he has done , and to what he means to do . He is now retrospective , and again prospective , in talking of personal contention , his combats never being present , which is by far the most agreeable method of obtaining reputation , as we thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rocky , in copying Dabbs as to his belligerent principles , is likewise careful to do the same , as far as it is possible , in relation to personal appearance . He is , therefore , a pocket Dabbs  --  a miniature Orson . He cultivates whiskers to the apex of the chin ; and although they are not very luxuriant , they make up in length what they want in thickness . He cocks his hat fiercely , rolls in his gait , and , with doubled fists , carries his arms in the muscular curve , elbows pointing outward , and each arm forming the segment of a circle . He slams doors after him , kicks little dogs , and swears at little boys , as Orson does . If any one runs against him , he waits until the offender is out of hearing , and then denounces him in the most energetic expletives belonging to the language , and is altogether a vinaigrette of wrath . It is the combat only that bothers Smalt ; if it were not for that link in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be a most truculent hero , and deserve a salary from all the nose menders about town , whether natural bone-setters or gristle-tinkers by commission  --  were it not for that , Larrey 's Military Surgery would be in continual demand , as a guide to the cure of contusions , and so great would be the application of oysters to the eye , that there would be a scarcity of shell-fish . Sometimes , however , Smalt 's flaming ardour precipitates him into a quarrel ; but , even then , he manages matters very adroitly , by selecting the largest individual of the opposite faction for his antagonist . " Come on ! " shrieks Smalt , in such an emergency ; " come on ! I 'll lick any thing near my own weight . I 'll chaw up any indewidooal that 's fairly my match  --  yes , and give him ten pounds . I ai n't petickelar , when it 's a matter of accommodation . Whe-e-w ! fire away ! " But , as Rocky 's weight is just ninety-four pounds , counting boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , and a little bit of cavendish , he is certain to escape ; for even the most valiant may be excused from encountering the long odds in a pitched battle , although he may sometimes run against them in a crowded chance-medley . Rocky , therefore , puts on his coat again , puffing and blowing like a porpoise , as he walks vapouring about , and repeating with an occasional attitude a la Orson Dabbs , " Any thing in reason  --  and a little chucked in to accommodate  --  when I 'm wound up , it ' most takes a stone wall to stop me , for I go right through the timber  --  that 's me ! " Yet these happy days of theoretical championship at length were clouded . Science avails nothing against love : Dan Cupid laughs at sparring , and beats down the most perfect guard . It so fell out that Orson Dabbs and Rocky Smalt both were smitten with the tender passion at the same time , the complaint perhaps being epidemic at the season . This , however , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp one , would not have been productive of discord between them , had it not unluckily happened that they became enamoured of the same " fair damosel . " Two warriors and but one lady !  --  not one lady per piece , to speak commercially , but one lady per pair . This was embarrassing  --  this was dangerous . Miss Araminta Stycke  --  or Miss Mint Stycke , as she was sometimes more sweetly termed  --  could not , according to legal enactments , marry both the gentlemen in question ; and as each was determined to have her entire , the situation was decidely perplexing , essentially bothering , and effectively dramatic , which , however amusing to the looker-on , is the ne plus ultra of discomfort to those who form the tableau . Miss Araminta could doubtless have been very " happy with either , were t' other dear charmer away ; " but this was out of the question ; for , when Dabbs on one side stuck to Stycke , Smalt on the other side just as assiduously stuck to Stycke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Mint Stycke , " said Rocky Smalt , at a tea party , taking hold of a dish of plums nicely done in molasses  --  " my dear Mint Stycke , allow me to help you to a small few of the goodies . " " Minty , my darling ! " observed Dabbs , who sat on her left hand , Rocky being on the right  --  " Minty my darling , " repeated Dabbs , with that dashing familiarity so becoming in a majestic personage , as he stretched forth his hand , and likewise grasped the dish of plums , " I insist upon helping you myself . " The consequence was an illustration of the embarras of having two lovers on the ground at the same time . The plums were spilt in such a way as to render Miss Stycke sweeter that ever , by giving " sweets to the sweet ; " but the young lady was by no means so pretty to look at as she had been before the ceremony . " Of the twain , she most affected " Dabbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minty , I do n't care for Dabbs , " said Rocky , in heroic tones ; " big as he is , if he comes here too often a crossing me , he 'll ketch it . I 'll thump him , Minty , I will  --  feed me on hay , if I do n't . " Minty laughed , and well she might , for just then Orson arrived , and , walking into the room , scowled fiercely at Smalt , who suddenly remembered " he had to go somewheres , and promised to be there early  --  he must go , as it was a'most late now . " " He thump me ! " said Dabbs , with a supercilious smile , when Minty repeated the threat . " The next time I meet that chap , I 'll take my stick and kill it  --  I 'll sqush it with my foot . " Unhappily for the serenity of his mind , Rocky Smalt had his ear at the key hole when this awful threat was made , and he quaked to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his word . He , therefore , fled instanter , and roamed about like a perturbed spirit ; now travelling quickly  --  anon pausing to remember the frightful words , and , as they rushed vividly to mind , he would hop-scotch convulsively and dart off like an arrow , the whole being done in a style similar to that of a fish which has indulged in a frolic upon cocculus indicus . In the course of his eccentric rambles , he stopped in at various places , and , either from that cause , or some other which has not been ascertained , he waxed valiant a little after midnight . But , as his spirits rose , his locomotive propensity appeared to decrease , and he , at length , sat down on a step . " So ! " soliloquized our hero : " he intends to belt me , does he ? Take a stick  --  sqush with his foot  --  and calls me it '  --  it ' right before Minty ! Powers of wengeance , settle on my fist , take aim with my knuckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't so tired , and if I had n't a little touch of my family disorder , I 'd start after him . I 'd go and dun him for the hiding ; and if he 'd only squat , or let me stand on a chair , I 'd give him a receipt in full , right in the face , under my own hand and seal . I 'd knock him this-er way , and I 'd whack him that-er way , till you could n't tell which end of his head his face was on . " Smalt suited the action to the word , and threw out his blows , right and left , with great vigour . Suddenly , however , he felt a heavy hand grasp his shoulder , and give him a severe shake , while a deep gruff voice exclaimed : " Halloo ! what the deuse are you about ? You 'll tear your coat . " " Ah ! " ejaculated Smalt , with a convulsive start ; " oh , do n't ! I holler enough ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you flunk out before we begin . Holler enough , indeed ! nobody 's guv ' you any yet . " " Ah ! " gasped Smalt , turning round ; " I took you for Orson Dabbs . I promised , when I cotch 'd him , to give him a licking , and I was werry much afeard I 'd have to break the peace . Breaking the peace is a werry disagreeable thing fur to do ; but I must  --  I 'm conshensis about it  --  when I ketches Orson . Somebody ought to tell him to keep out of the way , fur fear I 'll have to break the peace . " " It would n't do to kick up a row  --  but I 'm thinking it would be a little piece , if you could break it . I 'll carry home all the pieces you break off , in my waistcoat pocket . You 're only a pocket piece yourself . " " Nobody asked your opinions  --  go ' way . I 've got a job of thinking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts me out .

The mayor and the ' squires have gone to bed ; but the law is a thing that never gets asleep . After ten o'clock , the law is a watchman and a dog ketcher  --  we 're the whole law till breakfast 's a'most ready . " " You only want bristles to be another sort of a whole animal , " muttered Smalt . " Whew ! confound your little kerkus , what do you mean ? I 'd hit you unofficially , if there was any use in pegging at a fly . " Smalt began to feel uneasy ; so , taking the hint conveyed in the word fly , he made a spring as the commencement of a retreat from one who talked so fiercely and so disrespectfully . But he had miscalculated his powers . After running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his persecutor walking up , said : " Oh ! you stumpy little peace-breaker , I knows what you have been about  --  you 've been drinking . " " You nose it , hey ?  --  much good may it do you . Ca n't a man wet his whistle without your nosing it ? " " No , you ca n't  --  it 's agin the law , which is very full upon this pint . " " Pint ! Not the half of it  --  I have n't got the stowage room . " The " ketcher " laughed , for , notwithstanding their sanguinary profession , ketchers , like Lord Norbury , are said to love a joke , and to indulge in merriment , whenever the boys are not near . He therefore picked up Smalt , and placing him upon his knee , remarked as follows : " You 're a clever enough kind of little feller , sonny ; but you ai n't been eddicated to the law as I have ; so I 'll give you a lecture . Justice vinks at vot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ca n't ketch . When you want to break it , you must dodge . You may do what you like in your own house , and the law do n't know nothing about the matter . But never go thumping and bumping about the streets , when you are primed and snapped . That 's intemperance , and the other is temperance . But now you come under the muzzle of the ordinance  --  you 're a loafer . " " Now , look here  --  I 'll tell you the truth . Orson Dabbs swears he 'll belt me  --  yes , he calls me it '  --  he said he 'd sqush me with his foot  --  he 'd take a stick and kill it '  --  me , I mean . What am I to do ?  --  there 'll be a fight , and Dabbs will get hurt . " " He ca n't do what he says  --  the law declares he mus n't ; and if he does , it is n't any great matter  --  he 'll be put in limbo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species of comfort which had very little effect upon Smalt . He cared nothing about what might be done with Orson Dabbs after Orson had done for him . His new friend , however , proved , as Smalt classically remarked , to be like a singed cat , much better than he looked , for he conducted the Lilliputian hero home , and , bundling him into the entry , left him there in comfort . Rocky afterwards removed to another part of the town , for the purpose of keeping clear of his enemy , and , with many struggles , yielded the palm in relation to Miss Araminta Stycke , who soon became Mrs. Orson Dabbs . After this event , Rocky Smalt , who is not above the useful employment of gathering a little wisdom from experience , changed his system , and now speaks belligerently only in reference to the past , his gasconading stories invariably beginning , " A few years ago , when I was a fighting carackter . " UNDEVELOPED GENIUS . A PASSAGE IN THE LIFE OF P. PILGARLICK PIGWIGGEN , ESQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more of unpaid debts ; a brace of unsubstantialities , in which very little faith is reposed . The minor poets have twangled their lyres about the one , until the sound has grown wearisome , and until , for the sake of peace and quietness , we heartily wish that unwritten music were fairly written down , and published in Willig 's or Blake 's best style , even at the risk of hearing it reverberate from every piano in the city : while iron-visaged creditors  --  all creditors are of course hard , both in face and in heart , or they would not ask for their money  --  have chattered of unpaid debts , ever since the flood , with a wet finger , was uncivil enough to wipe out pre-existing scores , and extend to each skulking debtor the " benefit of the act . " But undeveloped genius , which is , in fact , itself unwritten music , and is very closely allied to unpaid debts , has , as yet , neither poet , trumpeter , nor biographer . Gray , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " mute inglorious Miltons , " and " Cromwells guiltless , " which showed him to be man of some discernment , and possessed of inklings of the truth . But the general science of mental geology , and through that , the equally important details of mental mineralogy and mental metallurgy , to ascertain the unseen substratum of intellect , and to determine its innate wealth , are as yet unborn ; or , if phrenology be admitted as a branch of these sciences , are still in uncertain infancy . Undeveloped genius , therefore , is still undeveloped , and is likely to remain so , unless this treatise should awaken some capable and intrepid spirit to prosecute an investigation at once so momentous and so interesting . If not , much of it will pass through the world undiscovered and unsuspected ; while the small remainder can manifest itself in no other way than by the aid of a convulsion , turning its possessor inside out like a glove ; a method , which the earth itself was ultimately compelled to adopt , that stupid man might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the digging . There are many reasons why genius so often remains invisible . The owner is frequently unconscious of the jewel in his possession , and is indebted to chance for the discovery . Of this , Patrick Henry was a striking instance . After he had failed as a shopkeeper , and was compelled to " hoe corn and dig potatoes , " alone on his little farm , to obtain a meagre subsistence for his family , he little dreamed that he had that within , which would enable him to shake the throne of a distant tyrant , and nerve the arm of struggling patriots . Sometimes , however , the possessor is conscious of his gift , but it is to him as the celebrated anchor was to the Dutchman ; he can neither use nor exhibit it . The illustrious Thomas Erskine , in his first attempt at the bar , made so signal a failure as to elicit the pity of the good natured , and the scorn and contempt of the less feeling part of the auditory . Nothing daunted , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left the court ; muttering , with more profanity than was proper , but with much truth , " By  --  ! it is in me , and it shall come out ! " He was right ; it was in him ; he did get it out , and rose to be Lord Chancellor of England . But there are men less fortunate ; as gifted as Erskine , though perhaps in a different way , they swear frequently , as he did , but they can not get their genius out . They feel it , like a rat in a cage , beating against their barring ribs , in a vain struggle to escape ; and thus , with the materials for building a reputation , and standing high among the sons of song and eloquence , they pass their lives in obscurity , regarded by the few who are aware of their existence , as simpletons  --  fellows sent upon the stage solely to fill up the grouping , to applaud their superiors , to eat , sleep , and die . P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these unfortunate undeveloped gentlemen about town . The arrangement of his name shows him to be no common man . Peter P. Pigwiggen would be nothing , except a hailing title to call him to dinner , or to insure the safe arrival of dunning letters and tailors ' bills . There is as little character about it as about the word Towser , the individuality of which has been lost by indiscriminate application . To all intents and purposes , he might just as well be addressed as " You Pete Pigwiggen , " after the tender maternal fashion , in which , in his youthful days , he was required to quit dabbling in the gutter , to come home and be spanked . But P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen , Esq .  --  the aristocracy of birth and genius is all about it . The very letters seem tasselled and fringed with the cobwebs of antiquity . The flesh creeps with awe at the sound , and the atmosphere undergoes a sensible change , as at the rarefying approach of a supernatural being . It penetrates the hearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a man 's name , and the substitution of an initial therefor , has an influence which can not be defined  --  an influence peculiary strong in the case of P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen  --  the influence of undeveloped genius  --  analogous to that which bent the hazel rod , in the hand of Dousterswivel , in the ruins of St. Ruth , and told of undeveloped water . But to avoid digression , or rather to return from a ramble in the fields of nomenclature , P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen is an undeveloped genius  --  a wasted man ; his talents are like money in a strong box , returning no interest . He is , in truth , a species of Byron in the egg : but unable to chip the shell , his genius remains unhatched . The chicken moves and faintly chirps within , but no one sees it , no one heeds it . Peter feels the high aspirations and the mysterious imaginings of poesy circling about the interior of his cranium ; but there they stay . When he attempts to give them utterance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries thought to the tongue and to the finger ends ; and as art has not yet found out the method of tunnelling or of driving a drift into the brain , to remedy such defects , and act as a general jail delivery to the prisoners of the mind , his divine conceptions continue pent in their osseous cell . In vain does Pigwiggen sigh for a splitting headache  --  one that shall ope the sutures , and set his fancies free . In vain does he shave his forehead and turn down his shirt collar , in hope of finding the poetic vomitory , and of leaving it clear of impediment ; in vain does he drink vast quantities of gin to raise the steam so high that it may burst imagination 's boiler , and suffer a few drops of it to escape ; in vain does he sit up late o ' nights , using all the cigars he can lay his hands on , to smoke out the secret . ' T is useless all . No sooner has he spread the paper , and seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a dull dead blank succeeds . As if a flourish of the quill were the crowing of a " rooster , " the dainty Ariels of his imagination vanish . The feather drops from his checked fingers , the paper remains unstained , and P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen is still an undeveloped genius . Originally a grocer 's boy , Peter early felt he had a soul above soap and candles , and he so diligently nourished it with his master 's sugar , figs , and brandy , that early one morning he was unceremoniously dismissed with something more substantial than a flea in his ear . His subsequent life was passed in various callings ; but call as loudly as they would , our hero paid little attention to their voice . He had an eagle 's longings , and with an inclination to stare the sun out of countenance , it was not to be expected that he would stoop to be a barn-yard fowl . Working when he could not help it ; at times pursuing check speculations at the theatre doors , by way of turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by crooked means , to feed his faculties with a view of the performances , he likewise pursued his studies through all the ballads in the market , until qualified to read the pages of Moore and Byron . Glowing with ambition , he sometimes pined to see the poet 's corner of our weekly periodicals graced with his effusions . But though murder may out , his undeveloped genius would not . Execution fell so far short of conception , that his lyrics were invariably rejected . Deep , but unsatisfactory , were the reflections which thence arose in the breast of Pigwiggen . " How is it , " said he  --  " how is it I ca n't level down my expressions to the comprehension of the vulgar , or level up the vulgar to a comprehension of my expressions ? How is it I ca n't get the spigot out , so my verses will run clear ? I know what I mean myself , but nobody else does , and the impudent editors say it 's wasting room to print what nobody understands . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often want to cut my throat , and would have done it long ago , only it hurts . I 'm chock full of genius and running over ; for I hate all sorts of work myself , and all sorts of people mean enough to do it . I hate going to bed , and I hate getting up . My conduct is very eccentric and singular . I have the miserable melancholics all the time , and I 'm pretty nearly always as cross as thunder , which is a sure sign . Genius is as tender as a skinned cat , and flies into a passion whenever you touch it . When I condescend to unbuzzum myself , for a little sympathy , to folks of ornery intellect  --  and caparisoned to me , I know very few people that ar' n't ornery as to brains  --  and pour forth the feelings indigginus to a poetic soul , which is always biling , they ludicrate my sitiation , and say they do n't know what the deuse I 'm driving at . Is n't genius always served o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy after my own heart , says ? And when the slights of the world , and of the printers , set me in a fine frenzy , and my soul swells and swells , till it almost tears the shirt off my buzzum , and even fractures my dickey  --  when it expansuates and elevates me above the common herd , they laugh again , and tell me not to be pompious . The poor plebinians and worse than Russian scurfs !  --  It is the fate of genius  --  it is his'n , or rather I should say , her'n  --  to go through life with little sympathization and less cash . Life 's a field of blackberry and raspberry bushes . Mean people squat down and pick the fruit , no matter how they black their fingers ; while genius , proud and perpendicular , strides fiercely on , and gets nothing but scratches and holes tore in its trousers . These things are the fate of genius , and when you see ' em , there is genius too , although the editors wo n't publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ janissaries , its cohorts , and its consorts . " But yet , though in flames in my interiors , I ca n't get it out . If I catch a subject , while I am looking at it , I ca n't find words to put it in ; and when I let go , to hunt for words , the subject is off like a shot . Sometimes I have plenty of words , but then there is either no ideas , or else there is such a waterworks and cataract of them , that when I catch one , the others knock it out of my fingers . My genius is good , but my mind is not sufficiently manured by ' ears . " Pigwiggen , waiting it may be till sufficiently " manured " to note his thoughts , was seen one fine morning not long since , at the corner of the street , with a melancholy , abstracted air , the general character of his appearance . His garments were of a rusty black , much the worse for wear . His coat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cogent than that of showing the moulding of his chest , and a black handkerchief enveloped his neck . Not a particle of white was to be seen about him ; not that we mean to infer that his " sark " would not have answered to its name , if the muster roll of his attire had been called , for we scorn to speak of a citizen 's domestic relations , and , until the contrary is proved , we hold it but charity to believe that every man has as many shirts as backs . Peter 's cheeks were pale and hollow ; his eyes sunken , and neither soap nor razor had kissed his lips for a week . His hands were in his pockets  --  they had the accommodation all to themselves  --  nothing else was there . " Is your name Peter P. Pigwiggen ? " inquired a man , with a stick , which he grasped in the middle . " My name is P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen , if you please , my good friend , " replied our hero , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " was the nonchalant response ; and " the man with a stick " drew forth a parallelogram of paper , curiously inscribed with characters , partly written and partly printed , of which the words , " The commonwealth greeting , " were strikingly visible ; " you 'll do , Mr. P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen Peter . That 's a capias ad respondendum , the English of which is , you 're cotched because you ca n't pay ; only they put it in Greek , so 's not to hurt a gentleman 's feelings , and make him feel flat afore the company . I ca n't say much for the manners of the big courts , but the way the law 's polite and a squire 's office is genteel , when the thing is under a hundred dollars , is cautionary . " There was little to be said . Peter yielded at once . His landlady , with little respect for the incipient Byron , had turned him out that morning , and had likewise sent " the man with a stick " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he of the " taking way " strolled leisurely behind . " It 's the fate of genius , squire . The money is owed . But how can I help it ? I ca n't live without eating and sleeping . If I was n't to do those functionaries , it would be suicide , severe beyond circumflexion . " " Well , you know , you must either pay or go to jail . " Now , squire , as a friend  --  I ca n't pay , and I do n't admire jail  --  as a friend , now . " " Got any bail ?  --  No !  --  what 's your trade  --  what name is it ? " " Poesy , " was the laconic , but dignified reply . " Pusey ?  --  Yes , I remember Pusey . You 're in the shoe-cleaning line , somewhere in Fourth street . Pusey , boots and shoes cleaned here . Getting whiter , ar' n't you ? I thought Pusey was a little darker in the countenance . " " P-o-e-s-y ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice ; " I 'm a poet . " " Well , Posy , I suppose you do n't write for nothing . Why did n't you pay your landlady out of what you received for your books , Posy ? " " My genius ai n't developed . I have n't written any thing yet . Only wait till my mind is manured , so I can catch the idea , and I 'll pay off all old scores . " " ' Twont do , Posy . I do n't understand it at all . You must go and find a little undeveloped bail , or I must send you to prison . The officer will go with you . But stay ; there 's Mr. Grubson in the corner  --  perhaps he will bail you . " Grubson looked unpromising . He had fallen asleep , and the flies hummed about his sulky copper-coloured visage , laughing at his unconscious drowsy efforts to drive them away . He was aroused by Pilgarlick , who insinuatingly preferred the request . " I 'll see you hanged first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody . I 'm undeveloped myself on that subject ,  --  not but that I have the greatest respect for you in the world , but the most of people 's cheats . " " You see , Posy , the development wo n't answer . You must try out of doors . The officer will go with you . " " Squire , as a friend , excuse me , " said Pilgarlick . " But the truth of the matter is this . I 'm delicate about being seen in the street with a constable . I 'm principled against it . The reputation which I 'm going to get might be injured by it . Would n't it be pretty much the same thing , if Mr. Grubson was to go with the officer , and get me a little bail ? " " I 'm delicate myself , " growled Grubson ; " I 'm principled again that too . Every man walk about on his own ' sponsibility ; every man bail his own boat . You might jist as well ask me to swallow your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgarlick knew that his boat was past bailing . Few are the friends of genius in any of its stages  --  very few are they when it is undeveloped . He , therefore , consented to sojourn in " Arch west of Broad , " until the whitewashing process could be performed , on condition he were taken there by the " alley way ; " for he still looks ahead to the day , when a hot-pressed volume shall be published by the leading booksellers , entitled Poems , by P. Pilgarlick Pigwiggen , Esq . THE BEST-NATURED MAN IN THE WORLD . A yielding temper , when not carefully watched and curbed , is one of the most dangerous of faults . Like unregulated generosity , it is apt to carry its owner into a thousand difficulties , and , too frequently , to hurry him into vices , if not into crimes . But as it is of advantage to others while inflicting injury upon its possessor , it has , by the common consent of mankind , received a fine name , which covers its follies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a compound of indolence , vanity , and irresolution , is known and applauded as " good-nature ; " and , to have reached the superlative degree , so as to be called the " best-natured fellow in the world  --  almost too good-natured for his own good , " is regarded as a lofty merit . When applied to the proper person , though the recipient says nothing , it may be seen that it thrills him with delight ; the colour heightens on his cheek ; and the humid brilliance of his eye speaks him ready to weep with joy over his own fancied perfections , and to outdo all his former outdoings . He is warmed through by the phrase , as if he had been feasting upon preserved ginger , and he luxuriates upon the sensation , without counting the cost , and without calculating the future sacrifices which it requires . He seldom sees why he is thus praised . He is content that it is so , without inquiring into the process by which it was brought about . It is enough for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conclusion generally shows that , in phrase pugilistic , it is " enough . " There are few kinds of extravagance more ruinous than that of indulging a desire for being excessively good-natured , as the good-natured pussy learnt when the monkey used her paw to draw chestnuts from the fire . A man of circumscribed means may , with comparative safety , keep horses and dogs , drink Champagne and Burgundy , but upon races and upon cock-fights ; he may even gratify a taste for being very genteel  --  for these things may subside into moderation ; but being very good-natured , in the popular acception of the phrase , is like the juvenile amusement of sliding down Market street hill on a sled . The further one goes , the greater is the velocity ; and , if the momentum be not skilfully checked , we are likely to land in the water . The " best-natured fellow in the world " is merely a convenience ; very useful to others , but worse than useless to himself . He is the bridge across the brook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering pony of the Pampas , seeking his own provender , yet ridden by those who contribute not to his support . He giveth up all the sunshine , and hath nothing but chilling shade for himself . He waiteth at the table of the world , serveth the guests , who clear the board , and , for food and pay , give him fine words , which culinary research hath long since ascertained can not be used with profit , even in the buttering of parsnips . He is , in fact , an appendage , not an individuality ; and when worn out , as he soon must be , is thrown aside to make room for another , if another can be had . Such is the result of excessive compliance and obsequious good-nature . It plundereth a man of his spine , and converteth him into a flexile willow , to be bent and twisted as his companions choose , and , should it please them , to be wreathed into a fish-basket . Are there any who doubt of this ? Let them inquire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be ragged , but his philosophy has not so many holes in it as might be inferred from the state of his wardrobe . Nay , it is the more perfect on that account ; a knowledge of the world penetrates the more easily when , from defective apparel , we approach the nearer to our original selves . Leniter 's hat is crownless , and the clear light of knowledge streams without impediment upon his brain . He is not bound up in the strait jacket of prejudice , for he long since pawned his solitary vest , and his coat , made for a Goliath , hangs about him as loosely as a politician 's principles , or as the purser 's shirt in the poetical comparison . Salix has so long bumped his head against a stone wall , that he has knocked a hole in it , and like Cooke , the tragedian , sees through his error . He has speculated as extensively in experience as if it were town lots . The quantity of that article he has purchased , could it be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convertible into cash , Croesus , King of Lydia , son of Halyattes , would be a Chelsea pensioner to Salix . But unluckily for him , there are stages in life when experience itself is more ornamental than useful . When , to use a forcible expression  --  when a man is " done , "  --  it matters not whether he has as much experience as Samson had hair , or as Bergami had whisker  --  he can do no more . Salix has been in his time so much pestered with duns , " hateful to gods and men , " that he is done himself . " The sun was rushing down the west , " as Banim has it , attending to its own business , and , by that means , shedding benefit upon the world , when Leniter Salix was seen in front of a little grocery , the locale of which shall be nameless , sitting dejectedly upon a keg of mackerel , number 2 . He had been " the best-natured fellow in the world , " but , as the geologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was rapidly becoming up to trap . At all events , he had his nose to the grindstone , an operation which should make men keen . He was houseless , homeless , penniless , and the grocery man had asked him to keep an eye upon the dog , for fear of the midsummer catastrophe which awaits such animals when their snouts are not in a bird cage . This service was to be recompensed with a cracker , and a glass of what the shopman was pleased to call racky mirackilis , a fluid sometimes termed " railroad , " from the rapidity with which it hurries men to the end of their journey . Like many of the best-natured fellows in the world , Salix , by way of being a capital companion , and of not being different from others , had acquired rather a partiality for riding on this " railroad , " and he agreed to keep his trigger eye on the dog . " That 's right , Salix . I always knowed you were the best-natured fellow in the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plaintive , uncertain manner , as if he admitted the fact , but doubted the honour ; " h-u-m-p-s-e ! but , if it was n't for the railroad , which is good for my complaint , because I take it internally to drive out the perspiration , I 've a sort of a notion Carlo might take care of himself . There 's the dog playing about without his muzzle , just because I 'm good-natured ; there 's Timpkins at work making money inside , instead of watching his own whelp , just because I 'm good-natured ; and I 'm to sit here doing nothing instead of going to get a little job a man promised me down town , just because I 'm good-natured . I ca n't see exactly what 's the use of it to me . It 's pretty much like having a bed of your own , and letting other people sleep in it , soft , while you sleep on the bare floor , hard . It would n't be so bad if you could have half , or quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , as I may say , turn in , take it all , roll themselves up in the kivering , and wo n't let us have a bit of sheet to mollify the white pine sacking bottom , the which is pleasant to whittle with a sharp knife  --  quite soft enough for that purpose  --  but the which is not the pink of feather beds . I do n't like it  --  I 'm getting tired . " The brow of Salix began to blacken  --  therein having decidedly the advantage of his boots , which could neither blacken themselves , nor prevail on their master to do it  --  when Mrs. Timpkins , the shopman 's wife , popped out with a child in her arms , and three more trapesing after her . " Law , Salix , how-dee-doo ? I 'm so glad  --  I know you 're the best-natured creature in the world . Jist hold little Biddy a while , and keep an eye on t' other young ' uns  --  you 're such a nurse  --  he ! he ! he !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy washing  --  most tea time  --  he ! he ! he ! Salix . " Mrs. Timpkins disappeared , Biddy remained in the arms of Salix , and " t' other young ' uns " raced about with the dog . The trigger eye was compelled to invoke the aid of its coadjutor . " Whew ! " whistled Salix ; " the quantity of pork they give in this part of the town for a shilling is amazin '  --  I 'm so good-natured ! That railroad will be well earnt , anyhow . I 'm beginning to think it 's queer there ai n't more good-natured people about besides me  --  I 'm a sort of mayor and corporation all myself in this business . It 's a monopoly where the profit 's all loss . Now , for instance , these Timpkinses wo n't ask me to tea , because I 'm ragged ; but they ar' n't a bit too proud to ask me to play child 's nurse and dog 's uncle  --  they wo n't lend me any money , because I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns  --  and they wo n't let me have time to earn any money , and get good clothes  --  that 's because I 'm so good-natured . I 've a good mind to strike , and be sassy . " " Hallo ! Salix , my good fellow ! " said a man , on a horse , as he rode up ; " you 're the very chap I 'm looking for . As I says to my old woman , says I , Leniter Salix is the wholesoul'dest chap I ever did see . There 's nothing he wo n't do for a friend , and I 'll never forget him , if I was to live as old as Methuselah . " Salix smiled  --  Hannibal softened rocks with vinegar , but the stranger melted the ice of our hero 's resolution with praise . Salix walked towards him , holding the child with one hand as he extended the other for a friendly shake . " You 're the best-natured fellow in the world , Salix , " ejaculated the stranger , as he leaped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended fingers , instead of shaking hands with him ; " you 're the best-natured fellow in the world . Just hold my horse a minute . I 'll be back in a jiffey , Salix ; in less than half an hour , " said the dismounted rider , as he shot round the corner . " If that ai n't cutting it fat , I 'll be darned ! " growled Salix , as soon as he had recovered from his breathless amazement , and had gazed from dog to babe  --  from horse to children . " Mr. Salix , " screamed Miss Tabitha Gadabout from the next house , " I 'm just running over to Timpson 's place . Keep an eye on my street door  --  back in a minute . " She flew across the street , and as she went , the words " best natured-soul alive " were heard upon the breeze . " That 's considerable fatter  --  it 's as fat as show beef , " said Salix . " How many eyes has a good-natured fellow got , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natureder you are , the more eyes you have , I s'pose . That job up town 's jobbed without me , and where I 'm to sleep , or to eat my supper , it 's not the easiest thing in the world to tell . Ai n't paid my board this six months , I 'm so good-natured ; and the old woman 's so good-natured , she said I need n't come back . These Timpkinses and all of ' em are ready enough at asking me to do things , but when I ask them  --  There , that dog 's off , and the ketchers are coming  --  Carlo ! Carlo ! " The baby began squalling , and the horse grew restive ; the dog scampered into the very teeth of danger ; and the three little Timpkinses , who could locomote , went scrabbling , in different directions , into all sorts of mischief , until finally one of them pitched head foremost into a cellar . Salix grew furious . " Whoa , pony !  --  hush , you infernal brat !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a young Timpkins smashed and spoilt !  --  knocked into a cocked hat ! " " Mr. Salix ! " shouted a boy , from the other side of the way , " when you 're done that ' ere , mammy says if you wo n't go a little narrand for her , you 're so good-nater 'd . " There are moments when calamity nerves us ; when wild frenzy congeals into calm resolve ; as one may see by penning a cat in a corner . It is then that the coward fights ; that the oppressed strikes at the life of the oppressor . That moment had come to Salix . He stood bolt upright , as cold and as straight as an icicle . His good-nature might be seen to drop from him in two pieces , like Cinderella 's kitchen garments in the opera . He laid Biddy Timpkins on the top of the barrel , released the horse , giving him a vigorous kick , which sent him flying down the street , and strode indignantly away , leaving Carlo , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , to the guardianship of chance . The last time Salix was seen in the busy haunts of men , he looked the very incarnation of gloom and despair . His very coat had gone to relieve his necessities , and he wandered slowly and dejectedly about , relieving the workings of his perturbed spirit by kicking whatever fell in his way . " I 'm done , " soliloquized he ; " pardenership between me and good-nature is this day dissolved , and all persons indebted will please to settle with the undersigned , who alone is authorized . Yes , there 's a good many indebted , and its high time to dissolve , when your pardener has sold all the goods and spent all the money . Once I had a little shop  --  ah ! was n't it nice ?  --  plenty of goods and plenty of business . But then comes one troop of fellows , and they wanted tick  --  I 'm so good-natured ; then comes another set of chaps , who did n't let bashfulness stand in their way a minute ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to borry money  --  I 'm so good-natured ; and more asked me to go security . These fellows were always very particular friends of mine , and got what they asked for ; but I was a very particular friend of theirs , and could n't get it back . It was one of the good rules that wo n't work both ways ; and I , somehow or other , was at the wrong end of it , for it would n't work my way at all . There 's few rules that will , barring substraction , and division , and alligation , when our folks allegated against me that I would n't come to no good . All the cypherin ' I could ever do made more come to little , and little come to less ; and yet , as I said afore , I had a good many assistants too . " Business kept pretty fair ; but I was n't cured . Because I was good-natured , I had to go with ' em frolicking , tea partying , excursioning , and busting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appinted treasurer to make the distribution when there was n't a cent of surplus revenue in the treasury , but my own . It was my job to pay all the bills . Yes , it was always Salix , you know me '  --  Salix , pony up at the bar , and lend us a levy '  --  Salix always shells out like a gentleman . '  --  Oh ! to be sure , and why not ?  --  now I 'm shelled out myself  --  first out of my shop by old venditioni exponas , at the State House  --  old fiery fash ' us to me directed . But they did n't direct him soon enough , for he only got the fixtures . The goods had gone out on a bust long before I busted . Next , I was shelled out of my boarding house ; and now , " ( with a lugubrious glance at his shirt and pantaloons , ) " I 'm nearly shelled out of my clothes . It 's a good thing they ca n't easy shell me out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch my death of cold . I 'm a mere shell-fish  --  an oyster with the kivers off . " But , it was always so  --  when I was a little boy , they coaxed all my pennies out of me ; coaxed me to take all the jawings , and all the hidings , and to go first into all sorts of scrapes , and precious scrapings they used to be . I wonder if there is n't two kinds of people  --  one kind that 's made to chaw up t' other kind , and t' other kind that 's made to be chawed up by one kind ?  --  catkind of people and mouse-kind of people ? I guess there is  --  I 'm very much mouse myself . " What I want to know is what 's to become of me . I 've spent all I had in getting my eddication . Learnin ' , they say , is better than houses and lands . I wonder if anybody would swap some house and land with me for mine ? I 'd go it even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at prime cost ; but they wo n't ; and I begin to be afraid I 'll have to get married , or list in the marines . That 's what most people do when they 've nothing to do . " What became of Leniter Salix immediately , is immaterial ; what will become of him eventually , is clear enough . His story is one acting every day , and , though grotesquely sketched , is an evidence of the danger of an accommodating disposition when not regulated by prudence . The softness of " the best-natured fellow in the world " requires a large admixture of hardening alloy to give it the proper temper . A PAIR OF SLIPPERS ; OR , FALLING WEATHER . " Then I , and you , and all of us fell down . " Whenever we look upon the crowded thoroughfare , or regard the large assembly , we are compelled to admit that the infinite variety of form in the human race contributes largely to the picturesque . The eye travels over the diversity of shape and size without fatigue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , when , at each remove , it is sure to find a difference . Satiated with gazing at rotundity , it is refreshed by a glance at lathiness ; and , tired with stooping to the lowly , it can mount like a bird to the aspiring head which tops a maypole . But , while the potency of these pictorial beauties is admitted , it must be conceded that the variations from the true standard , although good for the eye-sight , are productive of much inconvenience ; and that , to consider the subject like a Benthamite , utility and the general advantage would be promoted if the total amount of flesh , blood , bone , and muscle were more equally distributed . As affairs are at present arranged , it is almost impossible to find a " ready made coat " that will answer one 's purpose , and a man may stroll through half the shops in town without being able to purchase a pair of boots which he can wear with any degree of comfort . In hanging a lamp , every shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a very troublesome matter so to swing it , that , while the short can see the commodities , the tall will not demolish the glass . If an abbreviated " turnippy " man , in the goodness of his heart and in articulo mortis , bequeaths his wardrobe to a long and gaunt friend , of what service is the posthumous present ? It is available merely as new clothing for the juveniles , or as something toward another kitchen carpet . Many a martial spirit is obliged to content himself with civic employment , although a mere bottle of fire and wrath , because heroism is enlisted by inches , and not by degree . If under " five foot six , " Csar himself could find no favour in the eye of the recruiting sergeant , and Alexander the Great would be allowed to bestride no Bucephalus in a dragoon regiment of modern times . Thus , both they who get too much , and they who get too little , in Dame Nature 's apportionment bill , as well as those who , though abundantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for grumbling , and for wishing that a more perfect uniformity prevailed . Some of the troubles which arise from giving a man more than his share in altitude , find illustration in the subjoined narrative :  --  Linkum Langcale is a subject in extenso . He is , to use the words of the poet , suggested by his name ,  --  " A bout " " Of linked sweetness long drawn out : " and , in speaking of him , it is not easy to be brief . Linkum is entirely too long for his own comfort  --  something short  --  if the word short may be used in this connexion  --  something short of the height of the Titans of old , who pelted Saturn with brickbats ; but how much has never yet been ascertained , none of his acquaintances being sufficiently acquainted with trigonometry to determine the fact . He is one of those men who , like the gentle Marcia , " tower above their sex , " and must always be called down to their dinner , as no information can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conversing with whom , it is always necessary to begin by hailing the maintop . There is not , however , more material in Linkum than enough for a man of ordinary length . The fault is in his not being properly made up . He is abominably wire drawn  --  stretched out , as Shakspeare says , almost to the crack of doom . It is clear that there has been an attempt to make too much of him , but the frame of the idea has not been well filled out . He is the streak of a Colossus , and he resembles the willow wand at which Locksley shot his gray goose shaft in the lists of Ashby de la Zouche . The consequence is , that Linkum is a crank vessel . If he wore a feather in his cap , he would be capsized at every corner ; and as it is , he finds it very difficult to get along on a windy day , without a paving stone in each coat pocket to preserve the balance of power . He is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass , notwithstanding the aptitude of alcohol to ascend into the brain , and so to encumber it as to render a perpendicular position troublesome to men shorter than himself . When in this condition , his troubles are numberless , and among other matters , he finds it very difficult to get a clear fall , there being in compact cities very little room to spare for the accommodation of long men tumbling down in the world . One evening Linkum walked forth to a convivial meeting , and supped with a set of jolly companions . Late at night a rain came on , which froze as it fell , and soon made the city one universal slide , sufficiently " glip " for all purposes , without the aid of saw-dust . Of Linkum 's sayings and doings at the social board , no record is preserved ; but it is inferred that his amusements were not of a nature to qualify him for the safe performance of a journey so slippery as that which it was necessary to undertake to reach home . No lamps were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supposing the moonshine , and of seeing their way as they walked , or of gathering themselves up when they fell , by the lantern of imagination . " Good night , fellers , " said Linkum , at the top of the steps , as the door closed after him . He pulled his hat over his eyes determinedly , buttoned his coat with resolution , and sucked at his cigar with that iron energy peculiar to men about to set forth on their way home on a cold , stormy night . The fire of the cigar reflected from his nose was the only illumination to be seen ; and Linkum , putting his hands deep into his pockets , kept his position on the first step of the six which were between him and the pavement . " I 've no doubt , " said he , as he puffed forth volumes of smoke , and seemed to cogitate deeply  --  " I 've not the slightest doubt that this is as beautiful a night as ever was ; only it 's so dark you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like another night in the dark ; but it 's a great advantage to a good looking evening , if the lamps are lit , so you can twig the stars and the moonshine . The fact is , that in this ' ere city , we do grow the blackest moons , and the hardest moons to find , I ever did see . Sometimes I 'm most disposed to send the bellman after ' em  --  or get a full blooded pinter to pint ' em out , while I hold a candle to see which way he pints . It would n't be a bad notion on sich occasions to ask the man in the steeple to ring which way the moon is . Lamps is lamps , and moons is moons , in a business pint of view , but practically they ai n't much if the wicks ai n't afire . When the luminaries are , as I may say , in the raw , it 's bad for me . I ca n't see the ground as perforately as little fellers , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a forrerd hyst , or a backerd hyst , or some sort of a hyst  --  but more backerds than forrerds , ' specially in winter . One of the most unfeeling tricks I know of , is the way some folks have got of laughing out , yaw-haw ! when they see a gentleman ketching a riggler hyst  --  a long gentleman , for instance , with his legs in the air , and his noddle splat down upon the cold bricks . A hyst of itself is bad enough , without being sniggered at : first , your sconce gets a crack ; then , you see all sorts of stars , and have free admission to the fireworks ; then , you scramble up , feeling as if you had no head on your shoulders , and as if it was n't you , but some confounded disagreeable feller in your clothes ; yet the jacksnipes all grin , as if the misfortunes of human nature was only a poppet show . I would n't mind it , if you could get up and look as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , after a royal hyst , without letting on he feels flat . In such cases , however , sympathy is all gammon ; and as for sensibility of a winter 's day , people keep it all for their own noses , and ca n't be coaxed to retail it by the small . " Linkum paused in his prophetic dissertation upon " hysts "  --  the popular pronunciation , in these parts , of the word hoist , which is used  --  quasi lucus a non lucendo  --  to convey the idea of the most complete tumble which man can experience . A fall , for instance , is indeterminate . It may be an easy slip down  --  a gentle visitation of mother earth ; but a hyst is a rapid , forcible performance , which may be done , as Linkum observes , either backward or forward , but of necessity with such violence as to knock the breath out of the body , or it is unworthy of the noble appellation of hyst . It is an apt , but figurative mode of expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes say , " lower him up , and hyst him down . " Our hero held on firmly to the railing , and peered keenly into the darkness , without discovering any object on which his vision could rest . The gloom was substantial . It required sharper eyes than his to bore a hole in it . The wind was up , and the storm continued to coat the steps and pavements with a sheet of ice . " It 's raining friz potatoes , " observed Linkum ; " I feel ' em , though I ca n't see ' em , bumping the end of my nose ; so I must hurry home as fast as I can . " Heedless and hapless youth ! He made a vain attempt to descend , but , slipping , he came in a sitting posture upon the top step , and , in that attitude , flew down like lightning  --  bump ! bump ! bump ! The impetus he had acquired prevented him from stopping on the sidewalk , notwithstanding his convulsive efforts to clutch the icy bricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curbstone , and splashing into the water , like a young Niagara . A deep silence ensued , broken solely by the pattering of the rain and the howling of the wind . Linkum was an exhausted receiver ; the hyst was perfect , the breath being completely knocked out of him . " Laws-a-massy ! " at length he panted , " ketching " breath at intervals , and twisting about as if in pain ; " my eyes ! sich a hyst ! Sich a quantity of hysts all in one ! The life 's almost bumped out of me , and I 'm jammed up so tight , I do n't believe I 'm so tall by six inches as I was before . I 'm druv ' up and clinched , and I 'll have to get tucks in my trousers . " Linkum sat still , ruminating on the curtailment of his fair proportions , and made no effort to rise . The door soon opened again , and Mr. Broad Brevis came forth , at which a low , suppressed chuckle was uttered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a quantity of hysts all in one " for the new comer , whose figure , however ,  --  short and stout ,  --  was much better calculated for the operation than Linkum 's . But Brevis seemed to suspect that the sliding was good , and the skating magnificent . " No , you do n't ! " quoth he , as he tried the step with one foot , and recovered himself ; " I have n't seen the Alleghany Portage and inclined planes for nothing . It takes me to diminish the friction , and save the wear and tear . " So saying , he quietly tucked up his coat tails , and sitting down upon the mat , which he grasped with both hands , gave himself a gentle impulse , crying " All aboard ! " and slid slowly but majestically down . As he came to the plain sailing across the pavement , he twanged forth " **25;1121;TOOLONG ! " in excellent imitation of the post horn , and brought up against Linkum . " Clear the course for the express mail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared Brevis , trumpeting the " alarum , " so well known to all who have seen a tragedy  --  " Tra-tretra-ta-ra-tra-a-a ! " That 's queer fun , anyhow , " said a careful wayfarer , turning the corner , with lantern in hand , and sock on foot , who , after a short parley , was induced to set the gentlemen on their pins . First planting Brevis against the pump , who sang " Let me lean on thee , " from the Sonnambula , in prime style , he undertook to lift up Linkum . " Well , " observed the stranger , " this is a chap without no end to him  --  he 'd be pretty long a drowning , any how . If there was many more like him in the gutters , it would be better to get a windlass , and wind ' em up . I never see 'd a man with so much slack . The corporation ought to buy him , starch him up stiff , cut a hole for a clock in his hat , and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trust himself on the top of such a ricketty concern .  --  Neighbour , shall I fetch the Humane Society 's apparatus ? " " No  --  I ai n't drownded , only bumped severe . The curbstones have touched my feelings . I 'm all over like a map  --  red , blue , and green . " " Now , " said their friendly assistant , grinning at the joke , and at the recompense he had received for the job , " now , you two hook on to one another like Siameses , and mosey . You 've only got to tumble one a top of t' other , and it wo n't hurt . Tortle off  --  it 's slick going  --  ' specially if you 're going down . Push ahead ! " continued he , as he hitched them together ; and away they went , a pair of slippers , arm in arm . Many were their tumbles and many their mischances before they reached their selected resting place . " I ca n't stand this , " said Linkum to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's mostly owing to my being so tall . I wish I was razee 'd , and then it would n't happen . The awning posts almost knock the head off me ; I 'm always tumbling over wheelbarrows , dogs , and children , because , if I look down , I 'm certain to knock my noddle against something above . It 's a complete nuisance to be so tall . Beds are too short ; if you go to a tea-fight , the people are always tumbling over your trotters , and breaking their noses , which is what young ladies ai n't partial to ; and if you tipple too much toddy of a slippery night  --  about as easy a thing to do as you 'd wish to try  --  you 're sure to get a hyst a square long  --  just such a one as I 've had . If I 'd thought of it , I could have said the multiplication table while I was going the figure . Stumpy chaps , such as you , ai n't got no troubles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , " puffed Brevis , as Linkum alternately jerked him from his feet , and then caused him to slide in the opposite direction , with his heels ploughing the ice , like a shaft horse holding back : " phew ! That 's all you know about it  --  stumpies have troubles . " " I ca n't borrow coats , " added Linkum , soliloquizing , " because I do n't like cuffs at the elbows . I ca n't borrow pants , because it is n't the fashion to wear knee-breeches , and all my stockings are socks . I ca n't hide when anybody owes me a lambasting . You can see me a mile . When I sit by the fire , I ca n't get near enough to warm my body , without burning my knees ; and in a stage-coach , there 's no room between the benches , and the way you get the cramp  --  do n't mention it . " " I do n't know nothing about all these things ; but to imagine I was a tall chap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , for it 's a great stretch of imagination for a little feller to do that . " After which amicable colloquy , nothing more was heard of them , except that , before retiring to rest , they chuckled over the idea that the coming spring would sweat the ice to death for the annoyance it had caused them . But ever while they live , will they remember " the night of hysts . " INDECISION . " An obstinate temper is very disagreeable , particularly in a wife ; a passionate one very shocking in a child ; but for one 's own particular comfort , Heaven help the possessor of an irresolute one !  --  Its day of hesitation  --  its night of repentance  --  the mischief it does  --  the misery it feels !  --  its proprietor may well say , Nobody can tell what I suffer but myself ! " ' We know not to whom the remarks above quoted are to be attributed , but every observer of human actions will acquiesce in their justice . There are few misfortunes greater than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their nature ; the most inveterate of chronic diseases leaves the patient his hours of comfort ; but he who lacks decision of character must cease to act altogether before he can be released from the suffering it occasions . It is felt , whether the occasion be great or small , whenever there is more than one method of arriving at the same end , and it veers like a girouette at the aspect of alternatives . One can scarcely go so far as the poet , who quaintly says : " It needs but this , be bold , bold , bold ; ' T is every virtue told  --  Honour and truth , humanity and skill , The noblest charity the mind can will . " But the lines are pregnant with meaning . The curse of indecision impedes the growth of virtue , and renders our best powers comparatively inoperative . It would certainly be the parent of interminable confusion if all men were qualified to lead in the affairs of the world . The impulse to direct and to command is almost irrepressible . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of a movement , and clutches the baton of authority as if it had been his plaything from infancy . Even in the sports of childhood , the controlling and master spirit of the merry group is to be detected at a glance ; and , if three men act together for a day , the leading mind discovers and assumes its place . The inferior in mental power sink rapidly to their appropriate station ; the contemplation of an emergency tends to convince them that they are incompetent to head the column , and , although they may grumble a little , they soon fall quietly into the ranks . It , therefore , would not answer if all men had that self-reliance and that iron will which are the essential ingredients in the composition of a leading mind . The community would be broken up into a mob of generals , with never a soldier to be had for love or money . There would be no more harmony extant than there is in the vocal efforts of a roomfull of bacchanalians , when each man singeth his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be louder than his boon companions . Our time would be chiefly spent in trying to disprove the axiom , that when two men ride a horse one must ride behind . Each pony in the field would have riders enough ; but , instead of jogging steadily toward any definite end , he who was in the rear would endeavour to clamber to the front , and thus a species of universal leap-frog would be the order of the day . Great results could not be achieved , for action in masses would be a thing unheard of , and the nations would be a collection of unbound sticks . Yet the cultivation of the energies to a certain extent is a matter of import to the welfare and happiness of every individual . We are frequently placed in circumstances in which it is necessary to be our own captain-general ; and , with all deference to the improving spirit of the time , and to the labours of the many who devote themselves to the advancement of education , it must be confessed that the energies do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true there is an abundance of teaching ; we can scarcely move without coming in contact with a professor of something , who , in the plenitude of his love for his fellows , promises , for the most trifling consideration , to impart as much if not more than he knows himself , in a time so incredibly short that , if we were not aware of the wonder-working power of the high pressure principle , we should not believe it ; but no one has yet appeared in the useful character of a " Professor of Decision "  --  no one has yet thought it a good speculation to teach in six lessons of an hour each , the art of being able without assistance speedily to make up the mind upon a given subject , and to keep it made up , like a well-packed knapsack . There are arithmeticians and algebraists in plenty ; but the continent may be ranged without finding him who can instruct us how to solve , as Jack Downing would express it , a " tuff sum " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ingenuity has discovered no instrument to screw the mind to the sticking place . Now , although humility may be a very amiable characteristic , and deference to the opinions of others a very pleasing trait , yet promptness in decision and boldness in action form the best leggins with which to scramble through the thistles and prickles of active life ; and a professor of the kind alluded to would doubtless have many pupils from the ranks of those who have , by virtue of sundry tears and scratches , become anxious for a pair of nether integuments of that description . At least , he might rely upon DUBERLY DOUBTINGTON , THE MAN WHO COULD N'T MAKE UP HIS MIND " Leah , tell your master dinner 's been waiting for him this hour . " " He ca n't come , mem ;  --  the man 's with him yet , mem . " " What man ? " " The solumcolly man , mem ;  --  the man that stays so long , and is always so hard to go . " Every one who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter referred to by Leah . In fact , they may be divided into two classes  --  visiters who are " easy to go " and administer themselves , according to Hahnemann , in homoeopathic doses , and visiters who are " hard to go , " and are exhibited in quantity , in conformity with regular practice . The individual who was guilty of keeping Mr. Edax Rerum from his dinner was Duberly Doubtington , a man who could n't make up his mind  --  a defect of character which rendered him peculiarly hard to go , and made him responsible for having caused many to eat their mutton cold . It was Juliet who found , " Parting such sweet sorrow , That she could say good night till it be morrow ; " and Duberly 's farewells are equally interminable . When he has once fairly effected a lodgment , he is rooted to the spot . It is as difficult for him to go off , as it frequently is for stage heroes to make their pistols shoot . But , though it is hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be hours in going . By way of preparation , he first reaches his hat , and " smooths its raven down . " He then lays it aside again for the greater convenience of drawing on a glove , and that operation being completed , the gauntlet is speedily drawn off that he may adjust his side-locks . Much time being consumed in these interesting preliminaries , he has no difficulty at all in employing an additional hour when once fairly upon his legs . He discourses over the back of his chair , he pauses at the parlour door , he hesitates in the hall , and rallies manfully on the outer steps . The colder the weather the more determined his grasp upon his victim , having decidedly the advantage over the resident of the mansion , in being hatted , coated , and gloved . In this way , indeed , he deserves a medal from the faculty for cutting out doctor 's work , especially in influenza times . The straps and buckles of Duberly 's resolution will not hold , no matter how tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in the unphilosophic attempt to sit upon two stools . When he starts upon a race , an unconsidered shade of opinion is sure to catch him by the skirt , and draw him back . He is , in a measure , Fabian in policy . He shifts his position continually , and never hazards an attack . His warfare is a succession of feints and unfinished demonstrations , and he has been aptly likened to a leaden razor , which looks sharp enough , but will turn in the cutting . He is in want of a pair of mental spectacles ; for he has a weakness in the optic nerve of his mind 's eye which prevents him , in regarding the future , from seeing beyond the nose of the present movement . The chemistry of events , which figures out ulterior results from immediate combination and instant action , is a science as yet unknown to Duberly , Doubtington . He can not tell what to think ; he knows not what to do . The situations in which he is placed have never occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he is therefore perplexed in the labyrinth . Like the fabled coffin of Mohammed , he is always in a state of " betweenity . " He is , in short , as a forcible writer well observes , one of those unfortunate people who seldom experience " the sweet slumber of a decided opinion . " Such is the moral man of Duberly Doubtington , and his physical man betrays traits of indecision equally as strong . He tries to encourage his heart by cocking his beaver la militaire , but its furry fierceness can not contradict the expression of the features it surmounts . His eyebrows form an uncertain arch , rising nearly an inch above the right line of determination , and the button of his nose is so large and blunt as to lend any thing but a penetrating look to his countenance . His under lip droops as if afraid to clench resolutely with its antagonist ; and his whiskers hang dejectedly down , instead of bristling like a chevaux de frise toward the outer angle of the eye . The hands of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their own means of support , and he invariably leans his back against the nearest sustaining object . When he walks , his feet shuffle here and there so dubiously that one may swear they have no specific orders where to go ; and so indefinite are the motions of his body , that even the tails of his coat have no characteristic swing . They look , not like Mr. Doubtington 's coat-tails , but like coat-tails in the abstract  --  undecided coat-tails , that have not yet got the hang of anybody 's back , and have acquired no more individuality than those which dangle at the shop doors in Water street . Duberly Doubtington was at one time tolerably comfortable in his pecuniary circumstances . His father had been successful in trade , and , of course , thought it unnecessary to teach his children to make up their minds about any thing but enjoying themselves . This neglect , however , proved fatal to the elder Doubtington . That worthy individual being taken one warm summer afternoon with an apoplectic fit , the younger Doubtington was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if he did , what physician should be called in  --  whether he should or should not try to bleed him with a penknife , and whether it was most advisable to have him put to bed up stairs or to leave him upon the sofa down stairs ,  --  that the old gentleman , being rather pressed for time , could not await the end of the debate , and quietly slipped out of the world before his son could make up his mind as to the best method of keeping him in it . In fact , it was almost a chance that the senior Doubtington obtained sepulture at all , as Duberly could not make up his mind where that necessary business should take place ; and he would have been balancing the pros and cons of the question to this day , if some other person , more prompt of decision , had not settled the matter . Duberly Doubtington was now his own master . There were none entitled to direct , to control , or to advise him . He was the Phton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he pleased . But , although he had often looked forward to this important period with much satisfaction , and had theorised upon it with great delight , yet in practice he found it not quite so well adapted to his peculiar abilities as he thought it would be . A share of decision is required even by those who are placed beyond the necessity of toiling for bread . The disposition of his means frequently called on him to resolve upon a definite course . " I regard it as a very fair investment , Mr. Doubtington , " said his broker ; " your money is useless where it is . " But , what do you advise ?  --  under the circumstances , what should I do ? " replied Duberly . " Of course , I do n't pretend to direct . I want no unnecessary responsibility . There 's no knowing what may happen these slippery times . I think the chance a good one ; but make up your mind about it . " There are people who talk about making up one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat a dinner , or as if it were as purely mechanical as driving a nail , or putting on a pair of old familiar boots . " I pay that man for attending to my business , " muttered Duberly , " and yet he has the impudence to tell me to make up my mind !  --  That 's the very thing I want him to do for me . The tailor makes my clothes  --  Sally makes my bed  --  nature makes my whiskers , and John makes my fires ; yet I must be bothered to make up my mind about money matters ! I ca n't  --  the greatest nuisances alive are these responsibility shifting people ; and , if some one would tell me who else to get to attend to my business , I 'd send that fellow flying . " Difficult , however , as he supposed it would be , Duberly at length found a gentleman manager of his pecuniary affairs , who never troubled him to make up his mind , with what results shall appear anon . Duberly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first in the old world or in the new , and he therefore did neither ; but as time is always heavy on the hands of those who have much of it at disposal , and as it is difficult to lounge eternally at home , or in the street , he slowly established what the Scotch call a " howf " for each portion of the day . In the morning he dozed over the newspapers at a reading room ; between noon and the dinner hour , he lolled upon three chairs at the office of his friend Capias the lawyer , by way of facilitating that individual 's business ; the afternoon was divided between whittling switches at home and riding to some popular resort , where he cut his name upon the table . In the evening , if he did not yawn at the theatre , he visited some hospitable mansion , where the elders were good natured and the juniors agreeable . At the house of Mrs. St. Simon Sapsago , a bouncing widow , with a dashing son , and a pair of daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he could not make up his mind , he was in other respects so " eligible " that Mrs. St. Simon Sapsago was always pleased to see him , and willing that he should either listen or talk as much as he liked within her doors . Miss Ethelinda St. Simon Sapsago was a very pretty girl ; and , for some reason or other , comported herself so graciously to Duberly , that , when troubled to form a conclusion , he usually asked her advice , and to his great satisfaction , was sure to receive it in a comfortable , decisive way . " Miss Ethelinda , I 'm trying to make up my mind about coats ; but I ca n't tell whether I like bright buttons or not . Nor do I know exactly which are the nicest colours . I do wish there was only one sort of buttons , and only one kind of colour ; the way every thing is now , is so tiresome  --  one 's perpetually bothered . " So Ethelinda St. Simon Sapsago , with her sweetest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Duberly 's great delight . In fact , she was his " council 's consistory ; " or , as the Indians have it , she was his " sense-bearer , " a very important item in the sum total of one 's domestic relations . But , though these consultations were very frequent , still Duberly said nothing to the purpose , notwithstanding the fact that every one looked upon it as a " settled thing , " and wanted to know when it was to be . Duberly Doubtington , however , never dreamed of matrimony ; or if he did , it only floated like a vague mist across the distant horizon of his speculative thoughts . He regarded it as a matter of course that , at some period or other , he should have a wife and children  --  just as we all expect either to be bald , or to have gray hairs , and to die : but he shivered at the idea of being called on to make up his mind on such a step . He had a faint hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that it would , like old age , steal upon him by degrees , so that he might be used to it before he found it out . The connubial state , however , is not a one into which a Doubtington can slide by degrees ; there is no such thing as being imperceptibly married , a fact of which Mrs. and Miss St. Simon Sapsago were fully aware , and , therefore , resolved to precipitate matters by awakening Duberly 's jealousy . Ethelinda became cold upon giving her advice on the subject of new coats and other matters . Indeed , when asked by Duberly whether she did not think it would be better for him to curtail his whiskers somewhat during the summer months , she went so far as to say that she did n't care what he did with them , and that she never had observed whether he wore huge corsair whiskers , or lawyerlike apologies . Duberly was shocked at a defection so flagrant on the part of his " sense-bearer . " Insult his whiskers !  --  he could n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more shocked was he when he observed that she smiled upon Mr. Adolphus Fitzflam , who cultivated immense black curls , latitudinarian whiskers , black moustaches , with an imperial to match  --  Fitzflam , who made it the business of his life to " do the appalling , " and out-haired everybody except the bison at the " Zoological Institute . " Duberly felt uncomfortable ; he was not in love  --  at least he had never found it out  --  but he was troubled with a general uneasiness , an oppression , a depression , and a want of appetite . " Gastric derangement , " said the quack advertisements , and Duberly took a box of pills : " but one disease , " said the newspapers , and Duberly swallowed another box of pills , but without relief . Whenever Fitzflam approached , the symptoms returned . " I ca n't make up my mind about it , " said Duberly ; " but I do n't think I like that buffalo fellow , Fitzflam . Why do n't they make him up into mattrasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Doubtington , is n't Augustus Fitzflam a duck ? " said Ethelinda one evening when they were left tte-a-t te ; " such beautiful hair ! " " I ca n't tell whether he 's a duck or not , " said Duberly , dryly , " I have n't seen much more of him than the tip of his nose ; but , if not a member of the goose family , he will some day share the fate of the man I saw at Fairmount  --  be drowned in his own locks . " " But he looks so romantic  --  so piratical  --  as if he had something on his mind , never slept , and had a silent sorrow here . " " He had better try a box of the vegetable pills , " thought Duberly . " Well , I do declare it 's not surprising that so many have fallen in love with Adolphus Fitzflam , " and Miss Ethelinda St. Simon Sapsago breathed a scarcely perceptible sigh . Duberly started  --  his eyes were opened to his own complaint at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hurriedly declared himself . " Speak to my ma , " faintly whispered Miss Ethelinda St. Simon Sapsago . " To-morrow , " replied Duberly Doubtington , taking a tender , but rapid farewell . Duberly was horror-struck at his own rashness . He tossed and rolled all night , trying to make up his mind as to the propriety of his conduct . He stayed at home all day for the same purpose , and the next day found him still irresolute . " Mrs. St. Simon Sapsago 's compliments , and wishes to know if Mr. Duberly Doubtington is ill . " " No ! " Three days more , and yet the mind of Mr. Doubtington was a prey to perplexity . Mr. Julius St. Simon Sapsago called to ask the meaning of his conduct , and Duberly promised to inform him when he had made up his mind . Mr. Adolphus Fitzflam , as the friend of Julius St. S. Sapsago , with a challenge . " Leave your errand , boy , " said Doubtington , angrily , " and go . " Fitzflam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar with the cartel , and puffed away vigorously . What 's to be done ?  --  marry , or be shot ! I do n't like either  --  at least , I 've come to no conclusion on the subject . When I 've made up my mind , I 'll let ' em know  --  plenty of time . " No notice being taken of the challenge , Mr. Julius St. Simon Sapsago assaulted Mr. Doubtington in the street with a horsewhip , while Fitzflam stood by to enjoy the sport . There is nothing like a smart external application to quicken the mental faculties , and so our hero found it . " Stop ! " said he , dancing la Celeste . " You 're a scoundrel ! " cried Julius , and the whip cracked merrily . " I 've made up my mind ! " replied Duberly , suddenly shooting his clenched fist into the countenance of the flagellating Julius , who turned a backward summerset over a wheelbarrow . Fitzflam lost his hat in an abrupt retreat up the street , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his hairs been lives , " Duberly would have plucked them . But , from this moment , the star of Duberly Doubtington began to wane . The case of Sapsago versus Doubtington , for breach of promise of marriage , made heavy inroads upon his fortune . His new man of business , who took the responsibility of managing his money affairs without pestering him for directions , sunk the whole of his cash in the Bubble and Squeak Railroad and Canal Company , incorporated with banking privileges . Doubtington , therefore , for once was resolute , and turned politician ; and in this capacity it was that he called upon Mr. Edax Rerum for his influence to procure him an office . He still lives in the hope of a place , but , unluckily for himself , can never make up his mind on which side to be zealous until the crisis is past and zeal is useless . His last performance was characteristic . Having escorted the Hon. Phinkey Phunks to the steamboat , the vessel began to move before he had stepped ashore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fool ! " said a jarvey.  --  " Take keer  --  it 's too fur ! " said a newspaper boy . The advice being balanced , Doubtington was perplexed , and , making a half step , as the distance widened , he plumped into the river . He was fished out almost drowned , and , as he stood streaming and wo-be-gone upon the wharf , while other less liquid patriots earned golden opinions by shouting , " Hurrah for Phunks ! " imagination could scarcely conceive a more appropriate emblem of the results of indecision than that presented by Duberly Doubtington , a man who , had it been left to himself , would never have been in the world at all . DILLY JONES ; OR , THE PROGRESS OF IMPROVEMENT . One of the most difficult things in the world is to run before the wind ; and , by judiciously observing the changes of the weather , to avoid being thrown out . Fashion is so unsteady , and improvements are so rapid , that the man whose vocation yields him an abundant harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not a keen eye , and a plastic versatility , find that his skill and his business are both useless . Many were the poor barbers shipwrecked by the tax upon hair-powder , and numerous were the leather breeches makers who were destroyed by the triumph of woollens . Their skill was doubtless very great , but it would not avail in a contest against the usages of the world ; and unless they had the capacity to strike out a new course , they all shared the fate of their commodities , and retired to the dark cellars of popular estimation . Every day shows us the same principle of change at work , and no one has more reason to reflect and mourn about it than one Dilly Jones of this city . Dilly is not , perhaps , precisely the person who would be chronicled by the memoir writers of the time , or have a monument erected to him if he were no more ; but Dilly is a man of a useful though humble vocation , and no one can saw hickory with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dinner with more picturesque effect . Yet , as has been hinted above , Dilly has his sorrows , particularly at night , after a hard day 's work , when his animal spirits have been exhausted by reducing gum logs to the proper measure . In the morning he is full of life and energy , feeling as if he could saw a cord of Shot-towers , and snap the pillars of the Bank across his knee like pipe stems . In the full flush of confidence at that time of day , reflection batters against him in vain ; but as the night draws on , Dilly feels exhausted and spiritless . His enthusiasm seems to disappear with the sun , and neither the moon nor the stars can cause high tide in the river of his mind . The current of his good spirits shrinks in its channel , leaving the gay and gorgeous barques of hope and confidence drearily ashore on the muddy flats ; and his heart fails him as if it were useless longer to struggle against adversity . It was in this mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and saw fixed scientifically upon his shoulders . He meandered in his path in the way peculiar to men of his vocation , and travelled with that curvilinear elegance which at once indicates that he who practises it is of the wood-sawing profession , and illustrates the lopsided consequences of giving one leg more to do than the other . But Dilly was too melancholy on this occasion to feel proud of his professional air , and perhaps , had he thought of it , would have reproved the leg which performed the " sweep of sixty , " for indulging in such graces , and thereby embarrassing its more humble brother , which , knowing that a right line is the shortest distance between two places , laboured to go straight to its destination . Dilly , however , had no such stuff in his thoughts . His mind was reasoning from the past to the future , and was mournfully meditating upon the difficulties of keeping up with the changes of the times , which roll onward like a Juggernaut , and crush all who are not swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why fashions and customs should so continually change , and repined that he could not put a spoke in their wheel , that the trade of one 's early days might likewise be the trade of one 's latter years . So complete was his abstraction that he unconsciously uttered his thoughts aloud : " Sawing wood 's going all to smash , " said he , " and that 's where every thing goes what I speculates in . This here coal is doing us up . Ever since these black stones was brought to town , the wood-sawyers and pilers , and them soap-fat and hickory-ashes men , has been going down ; and , for my part , I ca n't say as how I see what 's to be the end of all their new-fangled contraptions . But it 's always so ; I 'm always crawling out of the little end of the horn . I began life in a comfortable sort of a way ; selling oysters out of a wheelbarrow , all clear grit , and did n't owe nobody nothing . Oysters went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellars was invented , and darn the oyster , no matter how nice it was pickled , could poor Dill sell ; so I had to eat up capital and profits myself . Then the pepree pot smoking ' was sot up , and went ahead pretty considerable for a time ; but a parcel of fellers come into it , said my cats was n't as good as their'n , when I know 'd they was as fresh as any cats in the market ; and pepree pot was no go . Bean soup was just as bad ; people said kittens was n't good done that way , and the more I hollered , the more the customers would n't come , and them what did , wanted tick . Along with the boys and their pewter fips , them what got trust and did n't pay , and the abusing of my goods , I was soon fotch 'd up in the victualling line  --  and I busted for the benefit of my creditors . But genius riz . I made a raise of a horse and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and working till I was free , and now here comes the coal to knock this business in the head . My people 's decent people , and I ca n't disgrace ' em by turning Charcoal Jemmy , or smashing the black stones with a pickaxe . They would n't let me into no society at all if I did . " The idea of being excluded from the upper circles of he society in which he had been in the habit of moving , fell heavily upon the heart of poor Dilly Jones . He imagined the curled lips and scornful glances of the aristocratic fair , who now listened with gratification to his compliments and to his soft nonsense ; he saw himself passed unrecognised in the street  --  absolutely cut by his present familiar friends , and the thought of losing caste almost crushed his already dejected spirit . The workings of his imagination , combined with the fatigue of his limbs , caused such exhaustion , that , dislodging his horse from his shoulder , he converted it into a camp-stool , seated himself under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slinging his saw petulantly at a dog , gazed with vacant eyes upon the people who occasionally passed , and glanced at him with curiosity . " Hey , mister ! " said a shop-boy , at last , " I want to get shut of you , ' cause we 're goin ' to shet up . You 're right in the way , and if you do n't boom along , why Ben and me will have to play hysence , clearance , puddin' 's out with you afore you 've time to chalk your knuckles  --  wo n't we , Ben ? " " We 'll plump him off of baste before he can say fliance , or get a sneak . We 're knuckle dabsters , both on us . You 'd better emigrate  --  the old man 's coming , and if he finds you here , he 'll play the mischief with you , before you can sing out I 'm up if you knock it and ketch . " ' So saying , the two lads placed themselves one on each side of Dilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinted very plainly at a forcible ejectment . Dilly , however , who had forgotten all that he ever knew of the phrases so familiar to those who scientifically understand the profound game of marbles , wore the puzzled air of one who labours to comprehend what is said to him . But the meaning became so apparent as not to be mistaken , when Ben gave a sudden pull at the horse which almost dismounted the rider . " Do n't be so unfeelin ' , " ejaculated Dilly , as he clutched the cross-bars of his seat ; " do n't be unfeelin ' , for a man in grief is like a wood-piler in a cellar  --  mind how you chuck , or you 'll crack his calabash . " " Take care of your calabash then , " was the grinning response ; " you must skeete , even if you have to cut high-dutchers with your irons loose , and that 's no fun . " " High-dutch yourself , if you know how ; only go ' way from me , ' cause I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the boys , " have n't we caught you on our payment ?  --  what do you mean by crying here  --  what do you foller when you 're at home ? " " I works in wood ; that 's what I foller . " " You 're a carpenter , I s'pose , " said Ben , winking at Tom . " No , not exactly ; but I saws wood better nor any half dozen loafs about the drawbridge . If it was n't for grief , I 'd give both of you six , and beat you too the best day you ever saw , goin ' the rale gum and hickory  --  for I do n't believe you 're gentlemen 's sons ; nothin ' but poor trash  --  half and half  --  want to be and ca n't , or you would n't keep a troubling of me . " " Gauley , Ben , if he is n't a wharf-rat ! If you do n't trot , as I 've told you a'ready , boss will be down upon you and fetch you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's enough , " replied Dilly ; " there 's more places nor one in the world  --  at least there is yet ; new fashions have n't shut up the streets yet , and obligated people to hire hackney balloons if they want to go a walkin ' , or omnibus boardin ' houses when they want a fip 's worth of dinner , or a levy 's worth of sleep . Natural legs is got some chance for a while anyhow , and a man can get along if he ai n't got clock-vurks to make him go . I hope , by'm'by , " added Dill scornfully , as he marched away from the chuckling lads , " that there wo n't be no boys to plague people . I 'd vote for that new fashion myself . Boys is luisances , accordin ' to me . " He continued to soliloquize as he went , and his last observations were as follows : " I wonder , if they would n't list me for a Charley ? Hollering oysters and bean soup has guv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em away , if the thieves were to hear me singing out , my style of doing it would almost coax ' em to come and be took up . They 'd feel like a bird when a snake is after it , and would walk up , and poke their coat collars right into my fist . Then , after a while , I 'd perhaps be promoted to the fancy business of pig ketching , which , though it is werry light and werry elegant , requires genus . Tis n't every man that can come the scientifics in that line , and has studied the nature of a pig , so as to beat him at canoeuvering , and make him surrender ' cause he sees it ai n't no use of doing nothing . It wants larning to conwince them critters , and it 's only to be done by heading ' em up handsome , hopping which ever way they hop , and tripping ' em up genteel by shaking hands with their off hind leg . I 'd scorn to pull their tails out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dragging ' em about by the ears . " But what 's the use ? If I was listed , they 'd soon find out to holler the hour and to ketch the thieves by steam ; yes , and they 'd take ' em to court on a railroad , and try ' em with biling water . They 'll soon have black locomotives for watchmen and constables , and big bilers for judges and mayors . Pigs will be ketched by steam , and will be biled fit to eat before they are done squealing . By and by , folks wo n't be of no use at all . There wo n't be no people in the world but tea kettles ; no mouths , but safety valves ; and no talking , but blowing off steam . If I had a little biler inside of me , I 'd turn omnibus , and week-days I 'd run from Kensington to the Navy Yard , and Sundays I 'd run to Fairmount . " THE FLESHY ONE . " ' T was fat , not fate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a sister city  --  there are little men in most cities  --  but the one now on the tapis is a peculiar little man  --  a fat little man . He is one who may be described as a person about five feet  --  five feet high and very nearly five feet thick , bearing much resemblance to a large New England pumpkin stuck upon a pair of beets . When he lies down to sleep , were it not for his nose at one extremity and his toes at the other , the spectator would naturally suppose that he was standing upright under the cover . When he descends the stairs , he might as well roll on his side as fatigue himself with walking ; and , as for tumbling down as other people tumble down , that is out of the question with Berry Huckel , or Huckel Berry , as he is sometimes called , because of his roundness . Should he , however , chance to trip ,  --  which he is apt to do , not being able to reconnoitre the ground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair start from the perpendicular , his " corporosity " touches the ground which his hands in vain attempt to reach , and he remains , until helped up , in the position of a schoolboy stretching himself over a cotton bale . Had he been the Lucius Junius of antiquity , the Pythia would never have been so silly as to advise him to kiss his mother earth ; for unless his legs are tilted up by some one like the handles of a wheelbarrow , Berry Huckel can never bite the dust . He can not fall on his nose  --  that glorious privilege has been denied to men of his periphery ; but when enjoying moderate serenity of mind , he is always able to sleep o ' nights , therein having no trifling advantage over your Seurats , your Edsons , your walking anatomies , whose aspect is a reproach to those who have the feeding of them . But biographical accuracy , and a desire that future generations may not be misled as to those important facts which make up the aggregate of history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Berry Huckel . He can not look upon the slender longitude of a bean-pole , he can not observe the attenuated extent of a hop-stick , or regard the military dandyism of a grey-hound 's waist , without experiencing emotions of envy , and wishing that he had himself been born to the same lankiness of figure , the same emaciation of contour . He rejoices not in his dimensions , and , contrary to all rules in physical science , believes that what he gains in weight , he loses in importance . It must , however , be confessed that he has some reason for discontent . He can not wear shoes , for he must have assistance to tie them , and other fingers than his own to pull them up at heel . Boots are not without their vexations , although he has a pair of long hooks constructed expressly for his own use ; and should a mosquito bite his knee  --  which mosquitoes are apt to do  --  it costs him a penny to hire a boy to scratch it . Berry is addicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerable verses , when he was thin enough to sit so near a table as to be able to write upon it . But this is not the case at present . His body is too large , and his arms too short , for such an achievement . It is happily so arranged that the mind of man in general accommodates itself to circumstances . We become reconciled to that which is beyond remedy , and at length scarcely bestow a thought upon subjects which , when new , were sources of much disquietude and annoyance . In fact , owing to the compensating principle so often acted on by nature , it is by no means rare to find vanity flourishing most luxuriantly in those who have least cause to entertain the feeling . The more numerous our defects , the greater is our self-satisfaction , and thus the bitterness and discontent that might be engendered by a knowledge that in mental or in physical gifts we are far inferior to the majority of mankind , are harmlessly and pleasantly prevented . Who so happy as the simpleton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior spirits with whom he is thrown in contact , and who would smilingly babble his niaiseries in the presence of the assembled wisdom of the world ? Who look more frequently or with greater delight into the mirror , than they who have in truth but little reason to be gratified with the object it reflects ?  --  and who indulge more in personal adornment than they in whom it would be the best policy to avoid display , and to attract the least possible attention to their outward proportions ? The ugly man is apt to imagine that the fair are in danger of being smitten with him at first sight , and perhaps  --  but we do not pretend to much knowledge on this branch of the subject , though suspecting , contrary to the received opinion , that the masculine gender are much more liable to the delusions of conceit than the softer sex , and that the guilty , having a more perfect command of the public ear , have in this instance , as in many others , charged their own sins upon the guiltless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same imputation . But who , even if he had the power , would be so unfeeling as to dissolve the charm and dissipate the " glamour " which is so potent in making up the estimate , when we sit in judgment on ourselves ? Who , indeed , could do it safely ?  --  for every one is indebted to the witchery of self-deception for no small portion of the comfortable sensations that strew flowers on his path through life ; and it would be the height of cruelty if the " giftie " desired by Burns were accorded , enabling us to " see oursels as ithers see us . " It was  --  had it been carried out to its full extent  --  an unkind offer , that of Cassius to play the moral looking-glass to his brother conspirator , and " show that to himself which he yet knew not of . " If true and unrelenting in its office , such a looking-glass would be in danger of a fracture , and it would have the alternatives of being either considered as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wound . But digression is a runaway steed ,  --  all this bears but slantingly on Berry Huckel , and they who love not generalizing , may substitute for it the individual specification that , owing to the comforting operation of custom , even Berry might not have troubled himself on the score of the circumstantial and substantial fat by which he is enveloped , had it not been that in addition to an affection for himself , he had a desire that he should be equally esteemed by another . In short , Berry discovered , like many other people , that his sensibilities were expansive as well as his figure  --  that it was not all sufficient to happiness to love one 's self , and that his heart was more than a sulky , being sufficient to carry two . Although so well fenced in , his soul was to be reached , and when reached , it was peculiarly susceptible of soft impressions . " The blind bow-boy 's butt-shaft " never had a better mark . In love , however , like does not consort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in temper , or each race would preserve its distinct lineage with the regularity of the stripes upon the tartan . The fiery little man  --  little men are almost always fiery , a fact which can only be accounted for on the theory , that whether the individual be big or little , he contains the same quantity of the electro-magnetism of vitality , or in other words , of the spirit of life ,  --  this spirit in a large body , having a greater amount of matter to animate , can not afford to flash and blaze except on extraordinary occasions  --  while , being superabundant in the smaller figure , it has a surplus on hand , which stimulates to restlessness and activity , engenders warmth and irritability of temper , and is always ready for explosion  --  thus , the fiery little man is apt to become attached to beauty upon a large scale . He loves by the ton , and will have no idol but one that he must look up to . By such means the petulance of diminutiveness is checked and qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking tower , on the contrary , who shakes the earth with his ponderous tread , dreams of no other lady-love except those miniature specimens of nature 's handiwork , who move with the lightness of the gossamer , and seem more like the creation of a delightful vision than tangible reality . In this , sombre greatness asks alleviation from the butterfly gayety which belongs to the figure of fairy mould . The swarthy bend the knee to those of clear and bright complexion , and your Saxon blood seeks the " dark-eyed one " to pay its devotions . The impulse of nature leads to those alliances calculated to correct faults on both sides , and to prevent their perpetuity . The grave would associate with the gay , the short pine for the tall , the fat for the lean , the sulky for the sunny  --  the big covet the little ; and , if our philosophy be not always borne out by the result , it is because circumstance or accident counteracts instinct , or that the cases cited form exceptions to the rule without impairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escape open behind him . At all events , Berry Huckel was in the strictest conformity to the rule . His affections were set upon lathiness , and if he could not fall in love , he certainly contrived to roll himself into it . He was indulging himself in a walk on a pleasant day , and , as usual , was endeavouring to dance along and to skip over the impediments in the path , for the purpose of persuading himself that he was a light and active figure , and that if any change were going on in his corporal properties , it was a favourable one , when an event occurred which formed an era in his life . He twirled his little stick ,  --  a big one would have looked as if he needed support ,  --  and , pushing a boy with a basket aside , attempted to hop over a puddle which had formed on the crossing at the corner of the street . The evolution , however , was not so skilfully achieved as it would have been by any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot came down " on the margin of fair Zurich 's waters , " and caused a terrible splash , sending the liquid mud about in every direction . " Phew ! " puffed Berry , as he recovered himself , and looked with a doleful glance at the melancholy condition in which his vivacity had left his feet . " Splut ! " ejaculated the boy with the basket , as he wiped the mud out of his eyes . " Jist let me ketch you up our alley , that 's all , puddy-fat ! " " Ah ! " shrieked Miss Celestina Scraggs , a very tall lady , and particularly bony , as she regarded the terrible spots and stains with which Berry had disfigured her dress : " what a pickle ! " Berry turned round at the voice of a female in distress , and the sight of her went to his heart like an arrow . Miss Celestina Scraggs was precisely his beau ideal of what a woman should be  --  not perhaps in countenance , but her figure was the very antipodes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . As for face and a few more years than are desirable , Berry cared not , if the lady were tall enough and thin enough , and in the individual before him he saw both those qualities combined . " My dear madam , " said Berry , ducking his head after the semblance of a bow , and raising his hat with a graceful curve  --  " my dear madam , I beg ten thousand pardons . Allow me , if you please , " continued he , observing that she paid no attention to his speech , and was attempting to shake off the looser particles of mud , an operation in which Berry ventured to assist . " Let me alone , sir  --  I wonder at your impudence , " was the indignant reply , and Miss Celestina Scraggs floated onward , frowning indignantly , and muttering as she went  --  " First splash a body , and then insult a body ! Pretty pickle ,  --  nice situation ! fat bear ! " Berry remained in attitude , his hat in one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress in the other . The scorn of the lady had no other effect on him than that of riveting his chains . " Hip-helloo , you sir ! " shouted an omnibus driver from his box , as he cracked his whip impatiently ; " do n't stand in the middle of the street all day a blockin ' up the gangvay , or I 'll drive right over you  --  blamenation if I do n't ! " " Shin it , good man ! " ejaculated a good-natured urchin ; " shin it as well as you know how ! " The qualification was a good one , Berry not being well calculated for a " shinner " of the first class . So starting from his revery , he hastened to escape " as well as he knew how , " and , placing his hat once more upon his head , he resolved to follow the injured lady to ascertain her residence , and to devise ways and means of seeking her favour under better auspices . He hurried up the street with breathless haste , forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present if walking a match against time on its hinder flippers . Passing over intermediate circumstances , it will suffice to say that Mr. Berry Huckel discovered the residence of Miss Scraggs , and that , by perseverance , he obtained an introduction according to etiquette . The more he saw of her the more thoroughly did he become fascinated ; but Miss Scraggs showed no disposition to receive his suit with any symptoms of favour . She scornfully rejected his addresses , chiefly because , although having no objection to a moderate degree of plumpness , his figure was much too round to square with her ideas of manly beauty and gentility of person . In vain did he plead the consuming passion , which , like the purest anthracite with the blower on , flamed in his bosom and consumed his vitals . Miss Scraggs saw no signs of spontaneous combustion in his jolly form ; and Miss Scraggs , who is " as tall and as straight as a poplar tree , " declared that she could not marry a man who would hang upon her arm like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grenadier in height might have been forgiven ; but to be short and " roly-poly " at the same time ! Miss Seraphina Scraggs could not think of it  --  she would faint at the idea . Berry became almost desperate . He took lessons on the flute , and trolled forth melancholy lays beneath the lady 's casement , to try the effect of dulcet sounds upon a hard heart ; but having been informed from a neighbouring window that fifer-boys were not wanted in that street , and that no nuisances would be tolerated , he abandoned music in despair ; and having consulted a physician as to the best method of reducing corpulency , he went to the Gymnasium , and endeavoured to climb poles and swing upon bars for hours at a time . But the unhappy Berry made but little progress , and in his unskilful efforts having damaged his nose and caused temporary injury to the beauty of his frontispiece , he gave up the design of making himself an athlete by that species of exercise . For sparring , he found that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted , and his body being such pleasant practice that his opponents never knew when to be done hitting at one whose frame gave no jarring to the knuckles . It was , however , picturesque to see Berry with the gloves on , accoutred for the fray , and squaring himself to strike and parry at his own figure in the glass . Deliberation and the line of beauty were in all his movements . Not obtaining his end in this way , he tried dieting and a quarter at dancing school ; but short-commons proved too disagreeable , and his gentle agitations to the sound of the fiddle , as he chassez 'd , coupez 'd , jetez 'd , and balancez 'd only increased his appetite and added to his sorrows . Besides , his landlady threatened to discharge him for damaging the house , and alarming the sleepers by his midnight repetitions of the lessons of the day . As he lay in bed wakeful with thought , he would suddenly , as he happened to remember that every moment was of importance for the reduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make tremendous efforts at a Page image - Page 109. performance of the " pigeon-wing , " each thump resounding like the report of a cannon , and causing all the glasses in the row to rattle as if under the influence of an earthquake . On one occasion indeed  --  it was about two o'clock in the morning  --  the whole house was roused by a direful , and , until then , unusual uproar in the chamber of Berry Huckel  --  a compound of unearthly singing and of appalling knocks on the floor . The boldest , having approached the door to listen , applied their ears to the keyhole , and heard as follows : " Turn out your toes  --  forward two  --  tol-de-rol-tiddle ( thump )  --  tiddle ( bump )  --  twiddle ( bang ! )  --  cross over  --  tiddle ( whack )  --  twiddle ( smack )  --  tiddle ( crack )  --  twiddle ( bang ! ) " ( Rap ! rap ! rap ! ) " Good gracious , Mr. Huckel , what 's the meaning of all this ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing  --  balance !  --  tiddle ( bump )  --  tiddle ( thump )  --  tiddle ( bang ! ) " Crash ! splash ! went the basin-stand , and the boarders rushing in , found Berry Huckel in " the garb of old Gaul , " stumbling amid the fragments he had caused by his devotions to the graces . He was in disgrace for a week , and always laboured under the imputation of having been a little non-com on that occasion ; but with love to urge him on , what is there that man will not strive to accomplish ? Berry 's dancing propensity led him to various balls and hops ; and on one of these occasions , he met Miss Scraggs in all her glory , but as disdainful as ever . After bowing to her with that respectful air , which intimated that the heart he carried , though lacerated by her conduct , was still warm with affection , he took a little weak lemonade , which , as he expressed it , was the appropriate tipple for gentlemen in his situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall in a despairing attitude , arms carelessly crossed , a handkerchief dangling negligently from his little finger , his mouth half open , and his eyes now fixed with resignation upon the ceiling , and anon dropping misanthropically to the ground . The tout ensemble was touching in the extreme , but Miss Scraggs only smiled derisively when her eyes fell upon her dejected lover Berry , however , finding that this would not do , cheered himself with wine , and danced furiously at every opportunity . Gracefully glided the dancers , merrily twinkled their feet , and joyously squeaked the fiddles , as Berry , late in the evening , panting with his previous Terpsichorean exertions , resolved to have a chat with the obdurate Seraphina , and solicited the honour of her fair hand for the next set . " Mons'us warm , miss , " said Berry , by way of opening the conversation in a novel and peculiarly elegant way , " mons'us warm , and dancing makes it mons'usser . " " Very mons'us , " replied Miss Scraggs , glancing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Miss Scraggs is disposed to set up for a wit ; " very mons'us , indeed . But you look warm , Mr. Huckel  --  had n't you better try a little punch ? It will agree with your figure . " " Punch ! " exclaimed Berry , in dismay , as he started back three steps  --  " Oh , Judy ! " He rushed to the refreshment room to cool his fever  --  he snatched his hat from its dusky guardian , forgetting to give him a " levy , " and hurriedly departed . It was not many hours afterwards that Berry  --  his love undiminished , and his knowledge refreshed that gymnastics are a remedy against exuberance of flesh  --  was seen with his hat upon a stepping stone in front of a house in Chestnut street , labouring with diligence at jumping over both the stone and the chapeau . But the heaviness of his heart seemed to rob his muscles of their elasticity . He failed at each effort , and kicked his hat into the middle of the street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruinationed to all intents and purposes . Oh ! if I was n't so fat , I might be snoozing it off at the rate of nine knots instead of tiring myself to death . Fat ai n't of no use , but on the contrary . Fat horses , fat cows , and fat sheep are respected accordin ' , but fat men are respected disaccordin ' . Folks laugh  --  the gals turn up their noses , and Miss Scraggs punches my feelings with a personal insinuation . Punch ! oh my !  --  It 's tiresome , to be sure , to jump over this ' ere , but it 's a good deal tiresomer to be so jolly you ca n't jump at all , and ca n't even jump into a lady 's affeckshins . So here 's at it agin . Warn'ee wunst ! warn'ee twy'st ! warn'ee three times  --  all the way home ! ' Berry stooped low , swinging his arms with a pendulum motion at each exclamation , and was about assuming the salient attitude of the pound of butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw at his wife , when he was suddenly checked by the arrival of a fellow boarder , who exclaimed , " Why , Berry , what are you at ? " " Do n't baulk , good man  --  I say , do n't baulk  --  but now you have done it , can you jump over that ' ere hat , fair standing jump , with a brick in each hand  --  none of your long runs and hop over ?  --  kin you do it ?  --  answer me that ! " queried Berry , as he blew in his hands , and then commenced flapping his arms la wood-sawyer . " Perhaps I might  --  but it wo n't do for us to be cutting rusties here at this time o ' night . You had better sing mighty small , I tell you . " " Pooh ! pooh ! do n't be redickalis . The doctor says if I do n't exercise , I 'll be smothered ; and Miss Scraggs called me punch , and wo n't have me  --  I 'm jumping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd better go prentice to Jeames Crow , " said his friend Brom , dryly , " and learn the real scientifics . " " It would make me laugh , " replied Berry , gravely ; " such as you can afford to laugh and get fat , but I ca n't . I 've jumped six fireplugs a ' ready , and I 'll jump over that ' ere hat before I go home  --  I 'm be blowed out bigger if I do n't . Now squat , Brom  --  squat down , and see if I go fair . Warn'ee wunst  --  " " You 're crazy ! " answered Brom , losing all patience , " you 're a downright noncompusser . I have n't seen a queerer fellow since the times of Zacchy in the mealbag ; ' and if you go on as you have lately , it 's my opinion that your relations should n't let you run at large . " " That 's what I complain of  --  I ca n't run any other way than at large ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to jump myself smaller . So clear out , skinny , and let me practyse . Warn'ee wunst !  --  " " You 'd better come home , and make no bones about it . " " Bones ! I ai n't got any . I 'm a boned turkey . If you do make me go home , you ca n't say you boned me . I 've seen the article , but I never had any bones myself . " This was , to all appearance , true enough , but his persecutor did not take the joke . Berry is , in a certain sense , good stock . He would yield a fat dividend ; but , though so well incorporated , no " bone-us " for the privilege is forthcoming . " Yes , you 're fat enough , and I 'm sorry to say , you 're queer enough too ; queer is hardly a name for you . You must be taken care of , and go home at once , or I 'll call assistance . " Well , if I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get the popperplexy , and do n't get Miss Scraggs , it 's all your fault . You wo n't let me dance in my chamber  --  you wo n't let me jump over my hat  --  you wo n't let me do nothing . I ca n't get behind the counter to tend the customers , without most backing the side of the house out ; but what do you care ?  --  and now you want me to get fatter by going to sleep . By drat ! I would n't wonder if I was to be ten pounds heavier in the morning . If I am , in the first place , I 'll charge you for widening me and spoiling my clothes ; and then  --  for if I get fatter , Miss Scraggs wo n't have me a good deal more than she wo n't now , and my hopes and affeckshins will be blighteder than they are at this present sitting  --  why , then , I 'll sue you for breach of promise of marriage . " " Come along . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you were thinned off . " " That 's jist exactly what I want ; I wish you could thin me off , " sobbed Berry , as he obeyed the order ; but he was no happier in the morning . Miss Seraphina Scraggs continues obdurate , for her worst fears are realized . He still grows fatter , though practising " warn'ee wunst " at all convenient opportunities . GARDEN THEATRICALS . Man is an imitative animal , and consequently , the distinguished success which has fallen to the lot of a few of our countrymen in the theatrical profession , has had a great effect in creating longings for histrionic honours . Of late years , debuts have been innumerable , and it would be a more difficult task than that prescribed by Orozimbo  --  " to count the leaves of yonder forest "  --  if any curious investigator , arguing from known to unknown quantities , were to undertake the computation of the number of Roscii who have not as yet been able to effect their coup d'essai . In this quiet city  --  many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to be found , burning with ardour to " walk the plank , " who , in their prospective dreams , nightly hear the timbers vocal with their mighty tread , and snuff the breath of immortality in the imaginary dust which answers to the shock . The recesses of the town could furnish forth hosts of youths who never thrust the left hand into a Sunday boot , preparatory to giving it the last polish , without jerking up the leg thereof with a Keanlike scowl , and sighing to think that it is not the well buffed gauntlet of crook 'd Richard  --  lads , who never don their night gear for repose , without striding thus attired across their narrow dormitory , and for the nonce , believing themselves accoutred to " go on " for Rolla , or the Pythagorean of Syracuse  --  two gentlemen who promenade in " cutty sarks , " and are as indifferent about rheumatism as a Cupid horsed upon a cloud . But in the times of which we speak , stage-struck heroes were rare . The theatrical mania was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenza , sometimes carrying off its victims ; but they were not multitudinous . Our actors were chiefly importations . The day of native talent was yet in the gray of its morning  --  a few streakings or so , among the Tressels and Tyrells , but nothing tip-topping it in the zenith . There are , however , few generalities without an exception , and in those days , Theodosius Spoon had the honour to prove the rule by being an instance to the contrary . Theodosius Spoon  --  called by the waggish Tea-spoon , and supposed by his admirers to be born for a stirring fellow  --  one who would whirl round until he secured for himself a large share of the sugar of existence  --  Theodosius Spoon was named after a Roman emperor  --  not by traditional nomenclature , which modifies the effect of the thing , but directly , " out of a history book " abridged by Goldsmith . It having been ascertained , in the first place , that the aforesaid potentate , with the exception of having massacred a few thousand innocent people one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor , he was therefore complimented by having his name bestowed upon a Spoon . It must not , however , be thought that the sponsors were so sanguine as to entertain a hope that their youthful charge would ever reach the purple . Their aspirations did not extend so far ; but being moderate in their expectations , they acted on the sound and well established principle that , as fine feathers make fine birds , fine names , to a certain extent , must have an analogous effect  --  that our genius should be educed , as it were , by the appellation bestowed upon us ; and that we should be so sagaciously designated that to whatever height fortune leads , fame , in speaking of us , may have a comfortable mouthful , and we have no cause under any circumstances to blush for our name . Mr. and Mrs. Spoon  --  wise people in their way  --  reasoned in the manner referred to . They were satisfied that a sonorous handle to one 's patronymic acts like a balloon to its owner , and that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick , and Harry denomination  --  is a mere dipsey , and must keep a man at the bottom . Coming to the application of the theory , they were satisfied that the homely though useful qualities of the spoon would be swallowed up in the superior attributes of Theodosius . That this worthy pair were right in the abstract is a self-evident proposition . Who , for instance , can meet with a Napoleon Bonaparte Mugg , without feeling that when the said Mugg is emptied of its spirit , a soul will have exhaled , which , had the gate of circumstance opened the way , would have played foot-ball with monarchs , and have wiped its brogues upon empires ? An Archimedes Pipps is clearly born to be a " screw , " and to operate extensively with " burning glasses , " if not upon the fleets of a Marcellus , at least upon his own body corporate . While Franklin Fipps , if in the mercantile line , is pretty sure to be a great flier of kites , and a speculator in vapours , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy Csar , it follows as a natural consequence that the puggish disposition of the family nose will , in his case , gracefully curve into the aquiline , and that the family propensity for the Fabian method of getting out of a scrape , will be Csarised into a valour , which at its very aspect would set " all Gaul " into a quake . Who can keep little Diogenes Doubikens out of a tub , or prevent him from scrambling into a hogshead , especially if sugar is to be gathered in the interior ? Even Chesterfield Gruff is half disposed to be civil , if he thinks he can gain by so unnatural a course of proceeding ; and everybody is aware that Crichton Dunderpate could do almost any thing , if he knew how , and if , by a singular fatality , all his fingers were not thumbs . Concurrent testimony goes to prove that the son of a great man is of necessity likewise great  --  the children of a blanchisseuse , or of a house-scrubber , have invariably clean hands and faces ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , if we are not mistaken , it has passed into a proverb that the male progeny of a clergyman , in general , labour hard for the proud distinction of being called " hopeful youths and promising youngsters . " The corollary , therefore , flows from this , as smoothly as water from a hydrant , that he who borrows an illustrious name is in all probability charged to the brim , ipso facto , with the qualities whereby the real owner was enabled to render it illustrious  --  qualities , which only require opportunity and the true position to blaze up in spontaneous combustion , a beacon to the world . And thus Theodosius Spoon , in his course through life , could scarcely be otherwise than , if not an antique Roman , at least an " antic rum ' un ; " his sphere of action might be circumscribed , but he could not do otherwise than make a figure . Our Spoon  --  his parents being satisfied with giving him an euphonious name  --  was early dipped into the broad bowl of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shoemaker to learn the art and mystery of stretching " uppers " and of shaping " unders . " But , for this employment , as it was merely useful and somewhat laborious , he had no particular fancy . Whether it was owing to the influence of his name or not , we can not pretend to say , but , like Jaffier and many other worthy individuals , he was much troubled with those serious inconveniences termed " elegant desires . " Young as he was , his talent for eating was aldermanic ; aristocracy itself might have envied his somnolent performances in the morning ; while , if fun or mischief were afoot , no watch dog could better encounter prolonged vigils , and no outlying cat could more silently and skilfully crawl in at a back window than he , when returning from his nocturnal perambulations . His genius for lounging , likewise , when he should have been at work , was as remarkable as his time-consuming power when sent on an errand . He could seem to do more , and yet perform less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , being ordered out on business , it was marvellous to see the swiftness with which he left the shop , and the rapidity of his immediate return to it , contrasted with the great amount of time consumed in the interval . With these accomplishments , it is not surprising that Theodosius Spoon was discontented with his situation . He yearned to be an embellishment  --  not a plodding letter , valuable only in combination , but an ornamental flourish , beautiful and graceful in itself ; and , with that self-reliance peculiar to genius , he thought that the drama opened a short cut to the summit of his desires . Many a time , as he leaned his elbow on the lapstone , and reposed his chin upon his palm , did his work roll idly to the floor , while he gazed with envious eyes through the window at the playbills which graced the opposite corner , and hoped that the time would come when the first night of Theodosius Spoon would be thereupon announced in letters as large as if he were a histrionic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thundering plaudits  --  of full pockets  --  of pleasant nights , and of day lounges up and down Chestnut street , the wonder of little boys and the focus of all eyes ,  --  floated vividly across his imagination . How could he , who bore the name of a Roman emperor , dream of being elsewhere that at the topmost round of fortune 's ladder , when he had seen others there , who , subjected to mental comparison , were mere rushlights compared to himself ? Filled with these gorgeous imaginings , our Spoon became metamorphosed into a spout , pouring forth streams of elocution by night and by day , and , though continually corking his frontispiece to try the expression in scenes of wrath , it soon became evident that his powers could not remain bottled in a private station . When a histrionic inclination ferments so noisily that its fizzling disturbs the neighbourhood , it requires little knowledge of chemistry to decide that it must have vent , or an explosion will be the consequence ; and such was the case in the instance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were truly terrible , and had become , during the occasional absence of the " boss , " familiar to every one within a square . An opportunity soon afforded itself .  --  Those Philadelphians , who were neither too old nor too young , when Theodosius Spoon flourished , to take part in the amusements of the town , do not require to be told that for the delectation of their summer evenings , the city then rejoiced in a Garden Theatre , which was distinguished from the winter houses by the soft Italian appellation of the Tivoli . It was located in Market near Broad street , in those days a species of rus in urbe , improvement not having taken its westward movement ; and before its brilliancy was for ever extinguished , the establishment passed through a variety of fortunes , furnishing to the public entertainment as various , and giving to the stage many a " regular " whose first essay was made upon its boards . At this period , so interesting to all who study the history of the drama , lived one Typus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with Spoon , and had been the first to give the " reaching of his soul " an inclination stageward . Typus worked in a newspaper office , where likewise the bills of the Garden Theatre were printed , and , par consequence , Typus was a critic , with the entre of the establishment , and an occasional order for a friend . It was thus that Spoon 's genius received the Promethean spark , and started into life . By the patronising attentions of Typus , he was no longer compelled to gaze from afar at the members of the company as they clustered after rehearsal , of a sunny day , in front of the theatre , and varied their smookings by transitions from the " long nine " to the real Habana , according to the condition of the treasury , or the state of the credit system . Our hero now nodded familiarly to them all , and by dint of soleing , heel-tapping , and other small jobs in the leather way , executed during the periods of " overwork " for Mr. Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that illustrious individual . Some idea of the honour thus conferred may be gathered from the fact that Mr. Winkins himself constituted the entire male department of the operatic corps of the house . He grumbled the bass , he warbled the tenor , and , when necessary , could squeak the " counter " in beautiful perfection . All that troubled this magazine of vocalism was that , although he could manage a duet easily enough , soliloquizing a chorus was rather beyond his capacity , and he was , therefore , often compelled to rely upon the audience at the Garden , who , to their credit be it spoken , scarcely needed a hint upon such occasions . On opera nights , they generally volunteered their services to fill out the harmony , and were so abundantly obliging , that it was difficult to teach them where to stop . In his private capacity  --  when he was ex officio Winkins  --  he did the melancholico-Byronic style of man  --  picturesque , but " suffering in his innards , "  --  to the great delight of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he walked forth , it was with his slender frame inserted in a suit of black rather the worse for wear , but still retaining a touching expression , softened , but not weakened , by the course of time . He wore his shirt collars turned down over a kerchief in the " fountain tie , " about which there is a Tyburn pathos , irresistible to a tender heart ; and with his well oiled and raven locks puffed out en masse on the left side of his head , he declined his beaver over his dexter eye until its brim kissed the corresponding ear . A profusion of gilt chain travelled over his waistcoat , and a multitude of rings of a dubious aspect encumbered his fingers . In this interesting costume did Julius Augustus Winkins , in his leisure moments , play the abstracted , as he leaned gracefully against the pump , while obliquely watching the effect upon the cigar-making demoiselles who operated over the way , and who regarded Julius as quite a love , decidedly the romantic thing . Winkins was gracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because both Spoon and Tympan were capital claqueurs , and invariably secured him an encore , when he warbled " Love has eyes , " and the other rational ditties in vogue at that period . Now it happened that business was rather dull at the Garden , and the benefit season of course commenced . The hunting up of novelties was prosecuted with great vigour ; even the learned pig had starred at it for once ; and as the Winkins night approached , Julius Augustus determined to avail himself of Spoon for that occasion , thinking him likely to draw , if he did not succeed , for in those days of primitive simplicity first appearances had not ceased to be attractive . The edge not being worn off , they were sure to be gratifying , either in one way or the other . It was of a warm Sunday afternoon that this important matter was broached . Winkins , Spoon , and Tympan sat solacing themselves in a box at the Garden , puffing their cigars , sipping their liquid refreshment , and occasionally nibbling at three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substantials of the entertainment . The discourse ran upon the drama . " Theo , my boy ! " said Winkins , putting one leg on the table , and allowing the smoke to curl about his nose , as he cast his coat more widely open , and made the accost friendly . " Spoon , my son ! " said Winkins , being the advance paternal of that social warrior , as he knocked the ashes from his cigar with a flirt of his little finger . " Spooney , my tight ' un ! "  --  the assault irresistible ,  --  " how would you like to go it in uncle Billy Shakspeare , and tip the natives the last hagony in the tragics ? " Winkins put his other leg on the table , assuming an attitude both of superiority and encouragement . " Oh , gammin ! " ejaculated Spoon , blushing , smiling , and putting the forefinger of his left hand into his mouth . " Oh , get out ! " continued he , casting down his eyes with the modest humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of it  --  I 'm as serious as an empty barn  --  got the genius  --  want the chance  --  my benefit  --  two acts of any thing  --  cut mugs  --  up to snuff  --  down upon ' em  --  fortune made  --  that 's the go . " " It 's our opinion ,  --  we think , Theodosius , " observed Typus Tympan , with editorial dignity , as he emphatically drew his cuff across the lower part of his countenance , " we think , and the way we know what 's what , because of our situation , is sing'ler  --  standing , as we newspaper folks do , on the shot tower of society  --  that now 's your time for gittin ' astraddle of public opinion , and for ridin ' it like a hoss . Jist such a chance as you 've been wantin ' . As the French say , all the bew mundy come to Winkins 's benefit ; and if the old man wo n't go a puff leaded , why we 'll see to havin ' it sneaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will draw like a blister  --  we will , even if we get licked for it . " " ' Two n't do , " simpered Spoon , as he blushed brown , while the expression of his countenance contradicted his words . " ' Two n't do . How am I to get a dress  --  s'pose boss ketches me at it ? Besides , I 'm too stumpy for tragedy , and anyhow I must wait till I 'm cured of my cold . " " It will do , " returned Winkins , decisively ; " and tragedy 's just the thing . There are , sir , varieties in tragedy  --  by the new school , it 's partitioned off in two grand divisions . High tragedy of the most helevated description , " ( Winkins always haspirated when desirous of being emphatic , ) " high tragedy of the most helevated and hexalted kind should be represented by a gentleman short of statue , and low comedy should be sustained by a gentleman tall of statue . In the one case , the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other case , wisey wersy . It makes light and shade between the sentiment and the performer , and jogs the attention by the power of contrast . The hintellectual style of playing likewise requires crooked legs . " " We think , then , our friend is decidedly calkilated to walk into the public . There 's a good deal of circumbendibus about Spoon 's gams  --  he 's got serpentine trotters  --  splendid for crooked streets , or goin ' round a corner , " interpolated Typus , jocularly . " There 's brilliancy about crooked legs , " continued Winkins , with a reproving glance at Typus . " The monotony of straight shanks answers well enough for genteel comedy and opera ; but corkscrew legs prove the mind to be too much for the body ; therefore , crooked legs , round shoulders , and a shovel nose for the heccentricities of the hintellectual tragics . Audiences must have it queered into ' em ; and as for a bad cold , why it 's a professional blessing in that line of business , and saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a sore throat . Blank verse , to be himpressive , must be frogged  --  it must be groaned , grunted , and gasped  --  bring it out like a three-pronged grinder , as if body and soul were parting . There 's nothing like asthmatic elocution and spasmodic emphasis , for touching the sympathies and setting the feelings on edge . A terrier dog in a pucker is a good study for anger , and always let the spectators see that sorrow hurts you . There 's another style of tragedy  --  the physical school  --  " " That must be a dose , " ejaculated Typus , who was developing into a wag . " But you 're not big enough , or strong enough for that . A physical must be able to outmuscle ten blacksmiths , and bite the head off a poker . He must commence the play hawfully , and keep piling on the hagony till the close , when he must keel up in an hexcruciating manner , flip-flopping it about the stage as he defuncts , like a new caught sturgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by taking the biggest fellow in the company by the scuff of the neck , and shaking him at arm 's length till all the hair drops from his head , and then pitch him across , with a roar loud enough to break the windows . That 's the menagerie method . The physical must always be on the point of bursting his boiler , yet he must n't burst it ; he must stride and jump as if he would tear his trousers , yet he must n't tear ' em ; and when he grabs anybody , he must leave the marks of his paws for a week . It 's smashing work , but it wo n't do for you , Spooney ; you 're little , black-muzzled , queer in the legs , and have got a cold ; nature and sleeping with the windows open have done wonders in making you fit for the hintellectuals , and you shall tip ' em the sentimental in Hamlet . " Parts of this speech were not particularly gratifying to Spoon ; but , on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clinched . Winkins trained him ; taught him when and where to come the " hagony ; " when and where to cut " terrific mugs " at the pit ; when and where to wait for the applause , and how to chassez an exit , with two stamps and a spring , and a glance en arriere . Not long after , the puff appeared as Typus promised . The bills of the " Garden Theatre " announced the Winkins benefit , promising , among other novelties , the third act of Hamlet , in which a young gentleman , his first appearance upon any stage , would sustain the character of the melancholy prince . Rash promise ! fatal anticipation ! The evening arrived , and the Garden was crowded . All the boys of the trade in town assembled to witness the debut of a brother chip , and many came because others were coming . Winkins , in a blue military frock , buttoned to the chin , white pantaloons strapped under the foot , and gesticulating with a shining black hat with white lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My love is like the red , red rose " with immense applause , when the curtain rang up , and the third act began . The tedious prattle of those who preceded him being over , Theodosius Spoon appeared . Solemnly , yet with parched lips and a beating heart , did he advance to the footlights , and duck his acknowledgments for the applause which greeted him . His abord , however , did not impress his audience favourably . The black attire but ill became his short squab figure , and the " hintellectual tragicality of his legs , " meandering their brief extent , like a Malay creese , gave him the aspect of an Ethiopian Bacchus dismounted from his barrel . Hamlet resembled the briefest kind of sweep , or " an erect black tadpole taking snuff . " With a fidelity to nature never surpassed , Hamlet expressed his dismay by scratching his head , and , with his eyes fixed upon his toes , commenced the soliloquy ,  --  another beautiful conception ,  --  for the prince is supposed to be speaking to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed as any other portion of his personal identity . This , however , was not appreciated by the spectators , who were unable to hear any part of the confidential communication going on between Hamlet 's extremities . " Louder , Spooney ! " squeaked a juvenile voice , with a villanous twang , from a remote part of the Garden . " Keep a ladling it out strong ! Who 's afeard ?  --  it 's only old Tiwoly ! " " Throw it out ! " whispered Winkins , from the wing . " Go it like a pair of bellowses ! " But still the pale lips of Theodosius Spoon continued quivering nothings , as he stood gasping as if about to swallow the leader of the fiddlers , and alternately raising his hands like a piece of machinery . Ophelia advanced . " Look out , bull-frog , there comes your mammy . Please , ma'am , make little sonny say his lesson . " Bursts of laughter , shouts , and hisses resounded through the Garden . " Whooror for Spooney ! " roared his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favour  --  " whooror for Spooney ! and wait till the skeer is worked off uv him ! " " How vu 'd you like it ? " exclaimed an indignant Spooneyite to a hissing malcontent ; " how vu 'd you like it fur to have it druv ' into you this ' ere vay ? Vot kin a man do ven he ai n't got no chance ? " As the hisser did but hiss the more vigorously on account of the remonstrance , and , jumping up , did it directly in the teeth of the remonstrant , the friend to Spooney knocked him down , and the parquette was soon in an uproar . " Leave him up ! " cried one  --  " Order ! put ' em down , and put ' em out ! " The aristocracy of the boxes gazed complacently upon the grand set-to beneath them , the boys whacked away with their clubs at the lamps , and hurled the fragments upon the stage , while Ophelia and Hamlet ran away together . " Ladies and gentlemen , " exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him " the rose and the expectancy of the fair state , " the shrinking Theodosius ,  --  " will you hear me for a moment ? " " Hurray for Vinkins ! " replied a brawny critic , taking his club in both hands , as he hammered against the front of the boxes ; " Vinkey , sing us the Bay uv Viskey , and make bull-frog dance a hornspike to the tune uv it . Hurray ! Twig Vinkey 's new hat  --  make a speech , Vinkey , fur your vite trousers ! " At length , comparative silence being restored , Mr. Winkins , red with wrath , yet suppressing his rage , delivered himself as follows  --  at times adroitly dodging the candle ends , which had been knocked from the main chandelier , and were occasionally darted at him and his protege . " Ladies and gentlemen , permit me ( dodge ) respectfully to ask one question . Did you ( dodge ) come here to admire the beauties of the drama , ( successive dodges to the right and left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand that you came solely to kick up a bloody row ? " The effect of this insinuating query had scarcely time to manifest itself , before Monsieur le directeur en chef , a choleric Frenchman , who made a profitable mixture of theatricals , ice cream , and other refreshments , suddenly appeared in the flat , foaming with natural anger at the results of the young gentleman 's debut . Advancing rapidly as the " kick " rang upon his ear , he suited the action to the word , and , by a dexterous application of his foot , sent Winkins , in the attitude of a flying Mercury , clear of the orchestra , into the midst of the turbulent crowd in the pit . Three rounds of cheering followed this achievement , while Theodosius gazed in pallid horror at the active movement of his friend . " Kick , aha ! Is zat de kick , monsieur dam hoomboog ? Messieurs et mesdames , lick him good  --  sump him into fee-penny beets ! Sacre ! " added the enraged manager , turning toward Theodosius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good  --  sump him bon , nice , moimeme  --  by me ownsef . " But the alarmed Theodosius , though no linguist , understood enough of this speech not to tarry for the consequences , and climbing into the boxes , while the angry manager clambered after him , he rushed through the crowd , and in the royal robes of Denmark hurried home . For the time , at least , he was satisfied that bearing the name of a Roman emperor did not lead to instant success on the stage , and though he rather reproached the audience with want of taste , it is not probable that he ever repeated the attempt ; for he soon , in search of an " easy life , " joined the patriots on the Spanish main , and was never after heard of . PETER BRUSH , THE GREAT USED UP . It was November ; soon after election time , when a considerable portion of the political world are apt to be despondent , and external things appear to do their utmost to keep them so . November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperious port ; when ambition gives place to melancholy ; when beauty hardly takes the trouble to look in the glass ; and when existence doffs its rainbow hues , and wears an aspect of such dull , commonplace reality , that hope leaves the world for a temporary excursion , and those who can not do without her inspiring presence , borrow the aid of pistols , cords , and chemicals , and send themselves on a longer journey , expecting to find her by the way :  --  a season , when the hair will not stay in curl ; when the walls weep dewy drops , to the great detriment of paper-hangings , and of every species of colouring with which they are adorned ; when the banisters distil liquids , any thing but beneficial to white gloves ; when nature fills the ponds , and when window-washing is the only species of amusement at all popular among housekeepers . It was on the worst of nights in that worst of seasons . The atmosphere was in a condition of which it is difficult to speak with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doings of nature . It was damp , foggy , and drizzling ; to sum up its imperfections in a sonorous and descriptive epithet , it was " ' orrid muggy weather . " The air hung about the wayfarer in warm , unhealthy folds , and extracted the starch from his shirt collar and from the bosom of his dickey , with as much rapidity as it robbed his spirits of their elasticity , and melted the sugar of self-complacency from his mind . The street lamps emitted a ghastly white glare , and were so hemmed in with vapory wreaths , that their best efforts could not project a ray of light three feet from the burner . Gloom was universal , and any change , even to the heat of Africa , or to the frosts of the arctic circle , would , in comparison , have been delightful . The pigs ' tails no longer waved in graceful sinuosities ; while the tail of each night-roving , hectoring bull-dog ceased flaunting toward the clouds , a banner of wrath and defiance to punier creatures , and hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little disposed to quarrel and offence . The ornamentals of the brute creation being thus below par , it was not surprising that men , with cares on their shoulders and raggedness in their trousers , should likewise be more melancholy than on occasions of a brighter character . Every one at all subject to the " skiey influences , " who has had trouble enough to tear his clothes , and to teach him that the staple of this mundane existence is not exclusively made up of fun , has felt that philosophy is but a barometrical affair , and that he who is proof against sorrow when the air is clear and bracing , may be a very miserable wretch , with no greater cause , when the wind sits in another quarter . Peter Brush is a man of this susceptible class . His nervous system is of the most delicate organization , and responds to the changes of the weather , as an Eolian harp sings to the fitful swellings of the breeze . Peter was abroad on the night of which we speak ; either because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near to tell him that such exposure was " not physical , " and that it was the part of prudence to go to bed , or that , although aware of the dangers of miasma to a man of his constitution , he did not happen at that precise moment to have access to either house or bed ; in his opinion , two essential pre-requisites to couching himself , as he regarded taking it al fresco , on a cellar door , not likely to answer any sanitary purpose . We incline ourselves to the opinion that he was in the dilemma last mentioned , as it had previously been the fate of other great men . But be that as it may , Mr. Peter Brush was in the street , as melancholy as an unbraced drum , " a gib-ed cat , or a lugged bear . " Seated upon the curb , with his feet across the gutter , he placed his elbow on a stepping-stone , and like Juliet on the balcony , leaned his head upon his hand  --  a hand that would perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been rash enough to volunteer to be a glove upon it . He was in a dilapidated condition  --  out at elbows , out at knees , out of pocket , out of office , out of spirits , and out in the street  --  an " out and outer " in every respect , and as outr a mortal as ever the eye of man did rest upon . For some time , Mr. Brush 's reflections had been silent . Following Hamlet 's advice , he " gave them an understanding , but no tongue ; " and he relieved himself at intervals by spitting forlornly into the kennel . At length , suffering his locked hands to fall between his knees , and heaving a deep sigh , he spoke :  --  " A long time ago , my ma used to put on her specs and say , Peter , my son , put not your trust in princes ; ' and from that day to this I have n't done any thing of the kind , because none on ' em ever wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince or a king ,  --  but one or two , and they had been rotated out of office ,  --  to borry nothing of them . Princes ! pooh !  --  Put not your trust in politicianers  --  them 's my sentiments . You might jist as well try to hold an eel by the tail . I do n't care which side they 're on , for I 've tried both , and I know . Put not your trust in politicianers , or you 'll get a hyst . " Ten years ago it came into my head that things were n't going on right ; so I pretty nearly gave myself up tee-totally to the good of the republic , and left the shop to look out for itself . I was brimfull of patriotism , and so uneasy in my mind for the salivation of freedom , I could n't work . I tried to guess which side was going to win , and I stuck to it like wax ;  --  sometimes I was a-one side , sometimes I was a-t'other , and sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jist in time to jine the hurrah . It was good I was after ; and what good could I do if I was n't on the ' lected side ? But , after all , it was never a bit of use . Whenever the battle was over , no matter what side was sharing out the loaves and the fishes , and I stepped up , I 'll be hanged if they did n't cram all they could into their own mouths , put their arms over some , and grab at all the rest with their paws , and say , Go away , white man , you ai n't capable . '  --  Capable ! what 's the reason I ai n't capable ? I 've got as extensive a throat as any of ' em , and I could swallow the loaves and fishes without choking , if each loaf was as big as a grindstone and each fish as big as a sturgeon . Give Peter a chance , and leave him alone for that . Then , another time when I called  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket full of spoils . Whichever side gets in , shares the spoils , do n't they ? ' So they first grinned , and then they ups and tells me that virtue like mine was its own reward , and that spoils might spoil me . But it was no spoils that spoilt me , and no loaf and fish that starved me  --  I 'm spoilt because I could n't get either . Put not your trust in politicianers  --  I say it agin . Both sides used me jist alike . Here I 've been serving my country , more or less , these ten years , like a patriot  --  going to town meetings , hurraing my daylights out , and getting as blue as blazes  --  blocking the windows , getting licked fifty times , and having more black eyes and bloody noses than you could shake a stick at , all for the common good , and for the purity of our illegal rights  --  and all for what ? Why , for nix . If any good has come of it , the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out of my arnings . I ca n't get no office ! Republics is ungrateful ! It was n't reward I was after . I scorns the base insinivation . I only wanted to be took care of , and have nothing to do but to take care of the public , and I 've only got half  --  nothing to do ! Being took care of was the main thing . Republics is ungrateful ; I 'm swaggered if they ai n't . This is the way old sojers is served . " Peter , having thus unpacked his o'erfraught heart , heaved a sigh or two , as every one does after a recapitulation of their own injuries , and remained for a few minutes wrapped in abstraction . " Well , well , " said he , mournfully , swaying his head to and fro after the sagacious fashion of Lord Burleigh  --  " live and learn  --  live and learn  --  the world 's not what a man takes it for before he finds it out . Whiskers grow a good deal sooner than experience  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  But anyhow , a man might as well be under kiver as out in the open air in sich weather as this . It 's as cheap laying down as it is settin ' up , and there 's not so much wear and tear about it . " With a groan , a yawn , and a sigh , Peter Brush slowly arose , and stretching himself like a drowsy lion , he walked toward the steps of a neighbouring house . Having reached the top of the flight , he turned about and looked round with a scrutinizing glance , peering both up and down the street , to ascertain that none of the hereditary enemies of the Brushes were in the vicinity . Being satisfied on that score , he prepared to enjoy all the comfort that his peculiar situation could command . According to the modern system of warfare , he carried no baggage to encumber his motions , and was always ready to bivouac without troublesome preliminaries . He therefore placed himself on the upper step , so that he was just within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his feet braced against the other , blockading the passage in a very effectual manner . He adjusted himself in position as carefully as the Sybarite who was annoyed at the wrinkle of a rose-leaf on his couch , grunting at each motion like a Daniel Lambert at his toilet , and he made minute alterations in his attitude several times before he appeared perfectly satisfied that he had effected the best arrangements that could be devised . After reposing for a while as if " the flinty and steel couch of war were his thrice-driven bed of down , " he moved his head with an exclamation of impatience at the hardness of the wall , and taking his time-worn beaver , he crumpled it up , and mollified the austerity of his bolster by using the crushed hat as a pillow . " That will do , " ejaculated Brush , clasping his hands before him , and twirling his thumbs ; and he then closed his eyes for the purpose of reflecting upon his condition with a more perfect concentration of thought than can be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way is always a hazardous experiment , whether it be after dinner , or in the evening ; and Peter Brush soon unwittingly fell into a troubled , murmuring sleep , in which his words were mere repetitions of what he had said before , the general scope of the argument being to prove the received axiom of former times , that republics do not distribute their favours in proportion to services rendered , and that , in the speaker 's opinion , they are not , in this respect , much better than the princes against whom his mother cautioned him . Such , at least , was the conviction of Mr. Brush ; at which he had arrived , not by theory and distant observation , but by his own personal experience . It is a long lane which has no turning , and it is a long sleep in the open air , especially in a city , which does not meet with interruption . Brush found it so in this instance , as he had indeed more than once before . Several gentlemen , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , after a short conversation , dispersed each to his several home . One , however , remained  --  the owner of the dog  --  who , whistling for his canine favourite , took out his night-key , and walked up the steps . The dog , bounding before his master , suddenly stopped , and after attentively regarding the recumbent Brush , uttered a sharp rapid bark . The rapidity of mental operations is such that it frequently happens , if sleep be disturbed by external sounds , that the noise is instantly caught up by the ear , and incorporated with the subject of the dream  --  or perhaps a dream is instantaneously formed upon the nucleus suggested by the vibration of the tympanum . The bark of the dog had one of these effects upon Mr. Brush . " Bow ! wow ! waugh ! " said the dog . " There 's a fellow making a speech against our side , " muttered Peter ; " but it 's all talk  --  where 's your facts ?  --  print your speech in pamphlet form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  everybody else is rascals  --  nothing but ruination when that fellow 's principles get the upper hand  --  our side for ever  --  we 're the boys ! " " Be still , Ponto ! " said the gentleman . " Now , sir , be pleased to get up , and carry yourself to some other place . I do n't know which side has the honour of claiming you , but you are certainly on the wrong side at present . " " Do n't be official and trouble yourself about other people 's business , " said Brush , trying to open his eyes ; " do n't be official , for it is n't the genteel thing . " " Not official ! what do you mean by that ? I shall be very official , and trundle you down the steps if you are not a little more rapid in your motions . " " Oh , very well , " responded Brush , as he wheeled round in a sitting posture , and fronted the stranger  --  " very well  --  be as sassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , by the way you talk  --  you 've got one of the fishes , though perhaps it is but a minny , and I ai n't  --  but if I had , I 'd show you a thing or two . Be sassy , be any thing , Mr. Noodle-soup . I do n't know which side you 're on either , but I do know one thing  --  it is n't saying much for your boss politicianer that he chose you when I must have been on his list for promotion  --  that 's all , though you are so stiff , and think yourself pretty to look at . But them that 's pretty to look at ai n't always good ' uns to go , or you would n't be poking here . Be off  --  there 's no more business before this meeting , and you may adjourn . It 's moved , seconded , and carried  --  pay the landlord for the use of the room as you go . " The stranger , now becoming somewhat amused , felt a disposition to entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , " said he , " that such a public spirited individual as you appear to be should find himself in this condition ? You 've had a little too much of the stimulantibus , I fear . " " I do n't know Greek , but I guess what you mean , " was the answer . " It 's owing to the weather  --  part to the weather , and part because republics is ungrateful ; that 's considerable the biggest part . Either part is excuse enough , and both together makes it a credit . When it 's such weather as this , it takes the electerizing fluid out of you ; and if you want to feel something like  --  do you know what something like ' is ?  --  it 's cat-bird , jam up  --  if you want to feel so , you must pour a little of the electerizing fluid into you . In this kind of weather you must tune yourself up , and get rosumed , or you ai n't good for much  --  tuned up to concert pitch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust in politicianers . " " And why not , Mr. Rosum ? " " Why not ! Help us up  --  there  --  steady she goes  --  hold on ! Why not ?  --  look at me , and you 'll see the why as large as life . I 'm the why you mus n't put your trust in politicianers . I 'm a rig'lar patriot  --  look at my coat  --  I 'm all for the public good  --  twig the holes in my trousers . I 'm steady in my course , and I 'm upright in my conduct  --  do n't let me fall down  --  I 've tried all parties , year in and year out , just by way of making myself popular and agreeable ; and I 've tried to be on both sides at once , " roared Brush , with great emphasis , as he slipped and fell  --  " and this is the end of it ! " His auditor laughed heartily at this striking illustration of the results of the political course of Peter Brush , and seemed quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavouring to be on two sides at once . He therefore assisted the fallen to rise . " Are you hurt ? " " No  --  I 'm used to being knocked about  --  the steps and the pavement are no worse than other people  --  they 're like politicianers  --  you ca n't put any trust in ' em . But , " continued Brush , drawing a roll of crumpled paper from the crown of his still more crumpled hat  --  " see here now  --  you 're a clever fellow , and I 'll get you to sign my recommendation . Here 's a splendid character for me all ready wrote down , so it wo n't give you any trouble , only to put your name to it . " " But what office does it recommend you for  --  what kind of recommendation is it ? " " It 's a circular recommend  --  a slap at any thing that 's going . " " Firing into the flock , I suppose ? " " That 's it exactly  --  good character  --  fit for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , or the gineral government . Now jist put your fist to it , " added Peter , in his most persuasive tones , as he smoothed the paper over his knee , spread it upon the step , and produced a bit of lead pencil , which he first moistened with his lips , and then offered to his interlocutor . " Excuse me , " was the laughing response ; " it 's too dark  --  I ca n't see either to read or to write . But what made you a politicianer ? Have n't you got a trade ? " " Trade ! yes , " replied Brush , contemptuously ; " but what 's a trade , when a feller 's got a soul ? I love my country , and I want an office  --  I do n't care what , so it 's fat and easy . I 've a genus for governing  --  for telling people what to do , and looking at ' em do it . I want to take care of my country , and I want my country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade I 'm made for  --  talking  --  that 's my line  --  talking in the streets , talking in the barrooms , talking in the oyster cellars . Talking is the grease for the wagon wheels of the body politic and the body corpulent , and nothing will go on well till I 've got my say in the matter ; for I can talk all day , and most of the night , only stopping to wet my whistle . But parties is all alike  --  all ungrateful ; no respect for genus  --  no respect for me . I 've tried both sides , got nothing , and I 've a great mind to knock off and call it half a day . I would , if my genus did n't make me talk , and think , and sleep so much I ca n't find time to work . " " Well , " said the stranger , " you must find time to go away . You 're too noisy . How would you like to go before the mayor ? " " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I 've asked him before ; but perhaps if you 'd speak a good word , he 'd give me the first vacancy . Introduce me properly , and say I want something to do shocking  --  no , not something to do  --  I want something to get ; my genus wo n't let me work . I 'd like to have a fat salary , and to be general superintendent of things in general and nothing in particular , so I could walk about the streets , and see what is going on . Now , put my best leg foremost  --  say how I can make speeches , and how I can hurray at elections . " " Away with you , " said the stranger , as he ran up the steps , and opened the door . " Make no noise in this neighbourhood , or you 'll be taken care of soon enough . " " Well , now , if that is n't ungrateful , " soliloquized Brush ,  --  " keep me here talking , and then slap the door right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and it 's about all I 'd a right to expect . Oh , pshaw !  --  sich a world  --  sich a people ! " Peter rolled up his " circular recommend , " put it in his hat , and slowly sauntered away . As he is not yet provided for , he should receive the earliest attention of parties , or disappointment may induce him to abandon both , take the field " upon his own hook , " and constitute an independent faction under the name of the " Brush party , " the cardinal principle of which will be that peculiarly novel impulse to action , hostility to all " politicianers " who are not on the same side . MUSIC MAD ; OR , THE MELOMANIAC . To be thin-skinned may add to the brilliancy and to the beauty of the complexion ; but , as this world goes , it is more of a disadvantage than a blessing . Where there is so much scraping and shaving , the cuticle of a rhinoceros is decidedly the most comfortable wear ; and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acuteness may be regarded as a serious misfortune . It opens the door to an infinite variety of annoyances . There are individuals with noses as keen as that of a beagle ; but whether they derive more of pleasure or of pain from the faculty , is a question easily answered when the multiplicity of odors is called to mind . To be what the Scotch term " nose-wise , " sometimes , it is true , answers a useful purpose , in preventing people in the dark from drinking out of the wrong bottle , and from administering the wrong physic ; it has also done good service in enabling its possessor to discover an incipient fire ; but such occasions for the advantageous employment of the proboscis are not of every-day occurrence , and , on the general average , its exquisite organization is an almost unmitigated nuisance to him who is obliged to follow from his cradle to his grave , a nose so delicately constituted , so inconveniently hypercritical , so frequently discontented , and so intolerably fastidious . They , likewise , who are gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " have sufferings peculiar to themselves , and , like the king of Denmark , receive their poison through the porches of the auricle . They are the victims of sound . It is conceded that from good music they derive pleasures of which the rest of the world can form but a faint conception ; but , notwithstanding the rage for its cultivation , really good music is not quite so plentiful as might be supposed , and the pain inflicted on the " family of fine ear " by the inferior article is not to be expressed in words . A discord passes through them as freezingly as if it were a bolt of ice ; a flat note knocks them down like a mace ; and , if the vocalist flies into the opposite extreme , and indulges in being a " little sharp , " all the acids of the shop could not give the unhappy critic a more vinegar aspect , or more effectually set his teeth one edge . To him a noise is not simply a noise in the concrete ; the discriminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were , to lump it as an infernal clatter . Like a skilful torturer , he analyzes the annoyance ; he augments the pain by ascertaining exactly why the cause is unpleasant , and by observing the relative discordance of the components , which , when united , almost drive him mad . The drum and the fife , for instance , do very well for the world at large ; but " the man with the ear " is too often agonized at perceiving how seldom it is that the drumstick twirler braces his sheepskin to the proper pitch , and he can not be otherwise than excruciated at the piteous squeaking of its imperfect adjunct  --  that " false one " which is truly a warlike instrument , being studiously and successfully constructed for offence , if not for defence . Now it so happens that Matthew Minim is a man with an ear , his tympanum being a piece of most elaborate workmanship . He could sing before he could talk , and his early musical experiments were innumerable . The first use he made of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " hush-a-by-baby , " in three keys ; and he could scarcely be prevailed upon to look at his pa , because that respectable individual , with a perversity peculiar to the incompetent , was always subjecting poor " Hail Columbia " to the Procrustean bed of his musical capabilities , and , while whistling to show his own light-heartedness , did any thing but communicate corresponding pleasure to his auditors . " Screw it up , poppy , " would little Minim exclaim , with the expression of one upon the rack ; " screw it up , and keep it there . What 's the use of chasing a tune all about ? " But in some mouths a tune will run all about of itself , let their lips be puckered ever so tightly , and there is no composition of a popular nature which is so often heard performing that erratic feat as the one familiarly termed " Hail Curlumby . " Matthew 's " poppy , " therefore , remained a tune-chaser , while Matthew himself went on steadily in the work of cultivating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , commenced his studies with the flute , which may be regarded among men and boys as the first letter of the alphabet in musical education . He then amused himself with the fiddle  --  tried the French horn for a season , varying the matter by a few lessons upon the clarionet and hautboy , and finally improving his powers of endurance by a little practising of the Kent bugle . He at length became a perfect melomaniac , and was always in danger of being indicted as a nuisance by his less scientific neighbours , whose ears were doomed to suffer both by night and by day . The twangling of stringed instruments was the only relief they could obtain from the blasts of those more noisy pieces of mechanism which receive voice from the lips , and it has even been supposed that Matthew Minim ranged his bugles , trumpets , and fiddles by the side of his bed , that he might practise between sleeps . Not long since , Matthew Minim was returning from a musical party late at night , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine art , was with him . Minim carried his flute in a box under his arm , and Jinks bore his fiddle in a bag on his shoulder . " Nature , " observed Minim , " is the most perfect of musicians ; she never violates the rules of composition , and though her performers are often noisy , yet , so long as they attempt no more than is jotted down for them , they are always in time and in tune . In fact , the world is one great oratorio . Hark !  --  listen ! throw aside vulgar prejudices , and hear how chromatic and tender are the voices of those cats in the kennel !  --  consider it as the balcony scene from Romeo e Giulietta  --  how perfectly beautiful that slide ! how exact the concord between the rotund bass notes of Thomas Cat , and the dulcet intonations of the feminine pussy , and how sparkling the effect produced by the contrast in the alternate passages ! They are the Fornasari and the Pedrotti of this moonlit scene . Bellini himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing more characteristic , appropriate , and touching ; nor could the most accomplished artistes give the idea of the composer with more fidelity . " " Yes , ma'am , " said Jenkinson Jinks , who was not altogether capable of entering into the spirit of the refined abstractions in which , after supper , his companion was prone to indulge . " Ph-i-t !  --  ph-i-z ! " exclaimed the cats , as they scampered away in alarm at the approach of the musicians . " Staccato and expressive in execution , " said Jinks ; " but certainly not stay-cat-o in effect . " " Admirable ! " remarked Minim  --  " Phit and phiz are the exact phrase to express in short metre that it is time to be off like a shot , and the notes in which they were uttered are those best calculated to convey the sense of the passage . " " A very rapid passage it was , too , " added Jinks ; " quite a roulade  --  the performers are running divisions up and down old Boodle 's fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I bar punning , " ejaculated Minim , impatiently ; " and to elucidate my theory upon the subject of natural music , and to prove  --  " " Categorically ? " inquired Jinks . " Hush ! To prove that the composer can have no better study for the true expression of the passions and emotions than is to be found in observing the animal creation , I shall now proceed to kick this dog , which lies asleep upon the pavement , and , without his being at all aware of what I want , I shall extract from him a heartrending passage in the minor key , expressive of great dolor , and of a sad combination of mental and physical discomfort . " " Stop ! " hurriedly exclaimed Jinks , ensconcing himself behind a tree ; " before you give that dogmatical illustration , allow me to inform you that the dog before you is old Boodle 's Towser  --  he bites like fury . " " Bite ! " replied Minim , contemptuously ; " and what 's a bite in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor key ? " Minim accordingly gave the dog a gentle push with his foot . " Ya-a-a-ah ! " angrily and threateningly remonstrated Towser , without moving . " There  --  I told you so ! " roared Jinks  --  " that 's not in the minor key  --  it 's as military a major as ever I heard in my life : when I listen to it , I can almost see you in the shape of a cocked hat . " " Well , then , poke him with your fiddle , " said Minim , drawing back , and eying the dog rather suspiciously . " Come away from the tree , and give Mr. Boodle 's Towser a jolly good punch . " " Not I , " replied Jinks ; " I 've no notion of letting my Cremona be chawed up agitato by an angry Towser  --  poke him with your flute . " " No  --  stop  --  I 'll get at him as it were slantindicularly  --  round a corner , " said Minim , retiring so that he was partially protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended his leg , and dealt to Mr. Boodle 's Towser a most prodigious kick . " Y-a-h ! y-o-a-h !  --  b-o-o ! " snarled the dog indignantly , as he dashed round the corner to revenge the insult , which was so direct and pointed that no animal of spirit could possibly pass it over unnoticed . Mr. Matthew Minim turned to fly , but he was not quick enough , and the dog entered a detainer by seizing him by the pantaloons . " Get out ! " shrieked Minim . " Take him off , Jinks , or he 'll eat me without salt ! " " Splendid illustration of natural music ! " shouted Jinks , clapping his hands in ecstasy ; " Con furore ! Da capo , Towser !  --  Volti subito , Minim !  --  Music expressive of tearing your breeches . I never saw a situation at once so picturesque , dramatic , and operatic . Why do n't you sing Oh , I can not give expression To this dog 's deep felt impression ? ' for I 'm sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving to your satisfaction how well nature understands counterpoint . Bravo , Towser !  --  that 's a magnificent shake ; but he wo n't let you favour us with a run ,  --  will he , Matthew ? " Towser held on determinedly , shaking his head and growling fiercely , with his mouth full of pantaloons , which , however , being very strong , did not give way and suffer the distressed captive to escape . " Hit him with a stick  --  get a big stone ! " panted Minim  --  " quit cracking jokes , for when the cloth goes the horrid beast will take hold again  --  perhaps of my flesh , and bite a piece right out ! " " Very likely  --  it 's better eating than woollens ; but go on with your duet  --  do n't mind me , " added Jinks quietly , as he looked about for a missile . Having found one sufficiently heavy for his purpose , he took deliberate aim , and threw it with such force that the angry animal was almost demolished . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaws and scampered down the street , making the neighbourhood vocal with his cries . " There , I told you , " said Minim , settling his disordered dress , and hoping , by taking the lead in conversation , to avoid any hard-hearted reference to his misfortune  --  " I told you he would sing out in the minor key , if he was hurt . Hear that now  --  the dog is really heartrending . " " Yes , " replied Jinks , " he 's quite a tearer of a dog  --  now heartrending , and from the looks of your clothes , he was a little while ago really breeches-rending . But pick up your flute  --  the lecture upon natural music is over for this evening . " " Um ! " growled Minim , discontentedly , as he took up his hat and flute-box , and walked doggedly forward . Not a word was said while they walked several squares . Peter was musing upon the cost of new pantaloons , and Jinks chuckled to himself as he thought how capitally the story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A protracted silence , however , if men are not alone or are not positively occupied , becomes wearisome and annoying , and brings the nerves into unpleasant action . Taciturnity , though commended , is after all but a monkish virtue . Nature designed the human race to talk when they are together  --  to be brightened and enlivened by an interchange of sentiment ; and while gratifying themselves by exhibiting their old ideas , to be enriched by the reception of new thoughts and fresh impressions . So strong is the impulse , that there are many minds which , under these circumstances , can not continue a chain of thought , and grow restless and impatient , in the belief that the neighbour mind gives out nothing because it waits for the lead , and is troubled for the want of it . The silence therefore continues , the same idea prevailing on both sides , and disabling each from tossing a subject into the air , to elicit that volley of ideas or of words , as the case may be , which constitutes conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never more frequently than in formal calls , when the parties are not so well acquainted as to be able to find a common topic on an emergency . He was not so much of a simpleton as people think him , who said a foolish thing during the excruciating period of an awkward pause , merely for the purpose of " making talk . " Every one is familiar with plenty of instances , in which a Wamba " to make talk " would have been regarded as a blessing , saving those present from the torture of cudgelling torpid brains in vain , and from the annoyance of knowing that each uncomfortable looking individual of the company , though likewise cudgelling , regarded every other person as remarkably stupid and unsocial . From feelings analogous to those just mentioned , was it that Jenkinson Jinks felt it incumbent upon him to hazard an observation . He looked about for a cloud , but there was none to be seen . He glanced at the stars , but they were neither very bright nor very dim . " Magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of starting a leading fact , which was at once undeniable and calculated to elicit a kindly response . The conscience of Jinks rather reproached him with having laughed too heartily at Minim 's recent misadventure , and he therefore selected a topic the least likely to afford opportunity for a petulant reply , or to open the way to altercation . Minim received the olive branch . " Yes , but there 's a grand mistake about this luxurious edifice for instance , " replied Minim ; halting , and leaning against a pump in front of a house which was adorned with both a bell and a knocker , " the builder has regarded the harmony of proportion , and all that  --  he has made the proper distances between the windows and doors ,  --  the countenance , expression , and figure of the house has been attended to ; but I 'm ready to bet , without trying , that no one has thought of its voice  --  no one has had the refined judgment to harmonize the bell and the knocker , and , luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the field to the bells . But , where they remain , there 's nothing but discord in the vocal department ; and if the servants have ears ,  --  and why should they not ?  --  it must almost drive them distracted . Yes , yes  --  very pretty  --  fine steps , fine house , bright knocker , glittering bell handle , and plenty of discord . It 's as sure as that the bell and knocker are there in juxtaposition . To be morally certain , I 'll try . " Up strode Matthew Minim to the top of the steps . " Now , Jinks  --  out with your fiddle  --  it 's up to concert pitch  --  sound your A. " Jinks laughingly did as he was ordered , and after a preliminary flourish , sounded orchestra fashion , " Twa-a-a  --  twawdle , tweedle , twawdle  --  twa-a-a ! " " Taw-lol-tol-tee  --  tee-lol-tol-taw ! " sang Minim , travelling up and down the octave , to be sure of the pitch . " Now , listen , " and he rattled a stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune with us no how you can take it  --  is it , Jinks ? " " No  --  twudle , tweedle , twudle , tweedle ! " replied Jinks , fiddling merrily , as he skipped about the pavement , delighted with his own skill . " Be quiet there  --  now , I 'll try whether the bell and the knocker are in tune with each other . Let 's give ' em a fair trial . " So saying , Minim seized the knocker in one hand , and the bell in the other , sounding them to the utmost of his power . " Oh , horrid ! shameful ! abominable !  --  even worse than I thought  --  upon my word !  --  " " Halloo , below ! " said a voice from the second story window , emanating from a considerable quantity of night-cap and wrapper ; " what 's the matter ? Is it the Ingens , or is the house afire ? " " I ai n't a fireman myself , and I ca n't tell until the big bell rings whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but , if the house is positively on fire , I advise you as a friend to come down , and leave it as soon as possible . Bring your clothes , for the weather 's not over warm . " " Yes , " said Jinks ; " bring your trousers anyhow , for we 've only got one whole pair down here . " " You 're a pair of impertinent rascals : what do you mean by kicking up such a bobbery at this time of night ? " " Bobbery !  --  do n't be cross , fiddle-strings ; always be harmonious in company , and melodious when you 're alone , especially when you snore . I merely wish to inform you that your bell and knocker do not accord . Just listen ! " Bell and knocker were both again operated on vigorously . " Did you ever hear the like ? I 'm ashamed of you  --  have them tuned , do  --  it 's dreadful . Tune ' em . " Once more Minim rang the bell and plied the knocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played " Nel furor delle tempeste , " from Il Pirata . The night-capped head disappeared from the window , and the musical gentlemen stood chattering and laughing , the one on the step and the other on the pavement , all unconscious of the mischief that was brewing for them . " Come , " said Minim  --  " let 's give these people a duet  --  a serenade will enlarge their musical capacities . " " What shall it be ? " queried Jinks , humming a succession of airs , to find something suited to the occasion . " Something about bells , if you do n't know any thing about knockers , " added Minim , giving the bell handle another affectionate tweak . Just then , Meinherr Night-cap and Wrapper returned to the window , aided by a stout servant , bearing a bucket of water . " I 'll not call the watch , " chuckled he , " but I 'll teach these fellows how to swim . " " Home , fare thee well , The ocean 's storm is over , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , " said the voice from the window , as Minim was drenched by the upsetting of the bucket  --  " take care of the ground-swell ! " A spluttering , panting , and puffing sound succeeded , like " The bubbling shrick , the solitary cry Of some strong swimmer in his agony . " Jinks paddled off rapidly  --  he had seen enough of the Cataract of the Ganges in former times : not so with Mr. Minim , who exclaimed , " Fire and fury ! who asked for a water-piece ? If Water parted ' is your tune , you may stick to Arne , but I 'll give you a touch of Kotzwara  --  a specimen of the Battle of Prague , ' with a little of the Halistone chorus . " ' Minim hammered away at the door ; but not being able to beat in the panels with his feet , he caught up a paving-stone and hurled it against the frame , shouting " Stony-batter ! " Windows flew up in all directions , and night-capped heads projected from every embrasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sprung all round . Never was there heard a less musical din . Minim stood aghast . " Worse and worse ! " cried he ; " what a clatter ! Haydn 's Chaos ' was a fool to this ! It 's natural music , however , and I 'll play my part till I get in , and catch the fellow who appointed himself the watering committee ; " and he , therefore , continued beating upon the door . Mr. Minim was , however , overpowered by a number of individuals , headed by the bucket bearing servant , and as his heels were tripped up , he mournfully remarked , " So fell Cardinal Wolsey . Will nobody favour us with the Last words of Marmion , ' or The soldier tired , ' My lodging is on the cold ground , ' or something else neat and appropriate ? " " Ca n't you get somebody to bail you ? " said a punning individual , alluding to Mr. Minim 's drenched condition . " Let him run , Jacob , " exclaimed the gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him round the corner , and give him a start . He is sufficiently water-lynched , and I want no further trouble on his account . " " I wo n't go , " replied Minim . " I 've finished playing for the night ; but as you are leader , give the coup d'archet , and set your orchestra in motion . I wo n't walk round the corner  --  carry me  --  this must be a sostenuto movement . " " Well , if that ai n't a good note ! " said the admiring crowd , as Minim was transported round the corner , whence , being set at liberty , he walked drippingly home , and ever after confined his musical researches within decorous bounds . RIPTON RUMSEY ; A TALE OF THE WATERS . They who are at all mindful of atmospheric phenomena must remember a storm , remarkable for its violence , which occurred not long since . It was a storm by night , and of those abroad at the time , every one averse to the shower bath , and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , at least until the impression is washed out by the floods of a greater tempest . In the evening , the rain , as if exercising itself for more important feats , fell gently and at intervals ; but as the night advanced , the wind came forth intent upon a frolic . Commencing with playful gambols , it amused itself at first with blowing out the old women 's candles at the apple stands . Then growing bolder , it extinguished a few corporation lamps , and , like a mischievous boy , made free to snatch the hats of the unguarded , and to whisk them through mud and kennel . At length becoming wild by indulgence , it made a terrible turmoil through the streets , without the slightest regard to municipal regulations to the contrary . It went whooping at the top of its voice round the corners , whistled shrilly through the key-holes , and howled in dismal tones about the chimney tops . Here , it startled the negligent housewife from her slumbers by slamming the unbolted shutter till it roared like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rusty sign until its ancient hinges creaked for mercy ; while at intervals , the heavy tumble of scantling told that when Auster chooses to kick up a breeze , he is very nearly as good at a practical joke as Boreas , or any other frolicsome member of the olian family . The clouds too threw open their sluices , and the water joining in the saturnalia , tried a variety of ways to amuse itself , and its capers were as numerous as those of the gale . It beat the tattoo upon the pavement with such sportive fury , that it was difficult to decide whether it did not rain upward as violently as it did downward . Anon the breeze came sweeping along in a horizontal shower , disdaining alike the laws of gravity , and the perpendicular , but more hackneyed method of accomplishing its object . In short , whether reference be had to wind or to water , it may be noted in the journals of those curious in regard to weather , as a night equally calculated to puzzle an umbrella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Selecting a single incident from the many , which it is natural to suppose might have been found by the aid of a diving bell on such a night , it becomes necessary to fish up Ripton Rumsey , who happened to be abroad on that occasion , as he is upon all occasions when left to consult his own wishes . Where Ripton had been in the early part of the evening , it would not have been easy either for himself or any one else to tell . It is , therefore , fair to infer that , distributing his attentions , he had been as usual " about in spots . " The fact is he has a hobby , which , like many hobbies , is apt to throw its rider . Although temperately disposed , such is the inquiring nature of his philosophic spirit , that , with a view perhaps to the ultimate benefit of the human race , he is continually experimenting as to the effects of alcoholic stimulants upon the human frame . It is probable , therefore , that on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat as imported , he had walked forth to qualify it by a stroll in the rain . This , however , is irrelevant , where he was , is the point at issue . The rain came down heavier than ever . A solitary watchman , more amphibious than his race in general , was seen wending his way through the puddles , thinking , if he thought at all , of the discomforts of those whom Noah left behind , and of that happy provision of nature which renders a wet back fatal to none but young goslings . Dodging between the drops was out of the question ; so he strode manfully onward , until he stumbled over something which lay like a lion , or a bundle of wet clothing , in his path . " Why , hello !  --  what do you call this when it 's biled , and the skin 's tuck off ? " said he , recovering himself , and giving the obstruction a thrust with his foot . " What 's this without ing'ens ? " continued he , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they ask for naked truths and uncooked facts . It was Ripton Rumsey  --  in that independent condition which places men beyond the control of circumstances , enabling them to sleep quietly either on the pavement or on the track of a well travelled railroad , and to repose in despite of rain , thunder , a gnawing conscience , or the fear of a locomotive . It was Ripton Rumsey , saved from being floated away solely by the saturated condition of both his internal and external man . " It 's a man , " remarked the investigator , holding to a tree with his right hand , as he curiously , yet cautiously pawed Ripton with his left foot . " It 's a man who 's turned in outside of the door , and is taking a snooze on the cold water principle . Well , I say , neighbour , jist in a friendly way , " added he , giving Ripton a prodigious kick as an evidence of his amicable feeling  --  " if you do n't get up , you 'll ketch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dadle . " Ripton 's condition , as before hinted , was beyond the ordinary impulses to human action ; and he , therefore , endured several severe digs with the foot aforesaid , without uttering more than a deep-toned grunt ; but at last the sharp corner of the boot coming in contact with his ribs , he suddenly turned over in the graceful attitude of a frog , and struck out vigorously . Like Giovanni 's faithful squire , he proved himself an adept at swimming on land . He " handled " his arms and legs with such dexterity , that before his progress could be arrested , he was on the curbstone . The next instant heard him plunge into the swollen and roaring kennel , and with his head sticking above the water , he buffeted the waves with a heart of controversy . " The boat 's blowed up , and them that ai n't biled are all overboard ! " spluttered the swimmer , as he dashed the waters about , and seemed almost strangled with the quantities which entered the hole in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undistilled fluids  --  " Strike out , or you 're gone chickens ! them as ca n't swim must tread water , and them as ca n't tread water must go to Davy Jones ! Let go my leg ! Every man for himself ! Phre-e-e ! bro-o-o ! Who 's got some splatterdocks ? " The watch looked on in silent admiration ; but finding that the aquatic gentleman did not make much headway , and that a probability existed of his going out of the world in soundings and by water , a way evidently not in conformity to his desires , the benevolent guardian of the night thought proper to interpose ; and bending himself to the work , at last succeeded in re-establishing Ripton Rumsey on the curbstone . " Ha ! " said Ripton , after gasping a few minutes , and wringing the water from his face and hair  --  " you 've saved me , and you 'll be put in the newspapers for it by way of solid reward . Jist in time  --  I 'd been down twyst , and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  once more and the last and the nearest gits it . Only think  --  my eye ! how the shads and the catties would a chawed me up ! Getting drownded ai n't no fun , and after you 're drownded it 's wus . My sufferings what I had and my sufferings what I like to had is enough to make a feller cry , only I ai n't got no hankercher , and my sleeve 's so wet it wo n't wipe good . " " Yes , young ' un , " said the Charley , " s'posing the fishes had been betting on elections , they 'd have invited the other fishes to eat you for oyster suppers ,  --  so much majority for sturgeon-nose , or a Ripton Rumsey supper for the company  --  why not ? If we ketch the fishes , we eat them ; and if they ketch us , they eat us ,  --  bite all round . " But the storm again began to howl , and as Ripton evidently did not understand the rationale of the argument , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutters . Even had he heard the fishes calling for " Ripton Rumseys fried , " " Ripton Rumseys stewed , " or " Ripton Rumseys on a chafing dish , " he would have felt indifferent about the matter , and if asked how he would take him , would undoubtedly have said , " Ripton Rumsey on a wheelbarrow . " " You must go to the watch-house . " " What fur must I ! Fetch along the Humane Society 's apparatus for the recovery of drownded indiwidooals  --  them 's what I want  --  I 'm water logged . Bring us one of the largest kind of smallers  --  a tumbler full of brandy and water , without no water in it . I 've no notion of being diddled out of the sweets of my interesting sitivation  --  I want the goodies  --  wrap me in a hot blanket and lay me by the fire  --  put hot bricks to my feet , fill me up with hot toddy , and then go away . That 's the scientific touch , and it 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm drownded I 'm a hard case . " The Charley promised all , if Ripton would accompany him . The soft delusion was believed , and the " hard case " was lodged in the receptacle for such as he , where , before he discovered the deception , he fell into a profound slumber , which lasted till morning . The examination was as follows :  --  " Where do you live ? " " I 'm no ways petickelar  --  jist where it 's cheapest and most convenient . The cheapest kind of living , according to my notion , is when it 's pretty good and do n't cost nothing . In winter , the Alms House is not slow , and if you 'll give us a call , you 'll find me there when the snow 's on the ground . But when natur ' smiles and the grass is green , I 'm out like a hoppergrass . The fact is , my constitution is n't none of the strongest ; hard work hurts my system ; so I go about doing little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get my catnip tea and bitters regular  --  any thing for a decent living , if it does n't tire a feller . But hang the city  --  rural felicity and no Charleys is the thing , after all  --  pumpkins , cabbages , and apple whiskey is always good for a weakly constitution and a man of an elewated turn of mind . " " Well , I 'll send you to Moyamensing prison  --  quite rural . " The sound of that awful word struck terror to the very marrow of Ripton . Like the rest of his class , while bearing his soul in his stomach , he carries his heart at the end of his nose , and to his heart rushed the blood from every part of his frame , until the beacon blazed with a lurid glare , and the bystanders apprehended nasal apoplexy . The rudder of his countenance grew to such a size that there was no mistaking the leading feature of the case . To see before him , Ripton was compelled to squint direfully , and as the beggar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of resting his tremendous proboscis on the clerk 's desk , while cocking his eye at his honour . " Miamensin ! " stammered Ripton  --  " Ouch , ouch ! now do n't ! that 's a clever feller . Arch street was all well enough  --  plenty of company and conversation to improve a chap . But Miamensin  --  scandaylus ! Why they clap you right into a bag as soon as you get inside the door , jist as if they 'd bought you by the bushel , and then , by way of finishing your education , they lug you along and empty you into a room where you never see nothing nor nobody . It 's jist wasting a man  --  I 'm be bagged if I go to Miamensin !  --  I 'd rather be in the Menagerry , and be stirred up with a long pole twenty times a day , so as to cause me for to growl to amuse the company . I ai n't potatoes to be put into a bag  --  blow the bag ! " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vagrant , and must be taken care of . " " That 's what I like ; but bagging a man is no sort of a way of taking care of him , unless he 's a dead robin or a shot tom-tit . As for being a vagrom , it 's all owing to my weakly constitution , and because I ca n't have my bitters and catnip tea regular . But if it 's the law , here 's at you . Being a judge , or a mayor , or any thing of that sort 's easy done without catnip tea ; it do n't hurt your hands , or strain your back ; but jist try a spell at smashing stones , or piling logs , and you 'd learn what 's what without being put in a bag . " Never mind , " said Ripton , as he was conducted from the office , " every thing goes round in this world . Perhaps I 'll be stuck up some day on a bench to ladle out law to the loafers . Who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaps that made Miamensin . I 'd ladle out the law to ' em so hot , they 'd not send their plates for more soup in a hurry . I 'd have a whole bucketful of catnip tea alongside , and the way they 'd ketch thirty days , and thirty days a top of that , would make ' em grin like chessy cats . First I 'd bag all the Charleys , and then I 'd bag all the mayors , and sew ' em up . " A WHOLE-SOULED FELLOW ; OR , THE DECLINE AND FALL OF TIPPLETON TIPPS . As the reader may have observed in his journey through life , the shades and varieties of human character are infinite . Although the temperaments , like the cardinal numbers , are not multitudinous , yet in the course of events they have been so combined with each other , and are so modified by circumstance , that ingenuity itself can not institute subdivisions to classify mankind with correctness . Whatever it may have been when our ancestors existed in the nomadic state and herded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperaments in their pristine purity ; and in consequence , it is but vague description to speak of others as sanguineous , nervous , or saturnine . Something more definite is required to convey to the mind a general impression of the individual , and to give an idea of his mode of thought , his habitual conduct , and his principles of action . Luckily , however , for the cause of science and for the graphic force of language , there is a universal aptitude to paint with words , and to condense a catalogue of qualities in a phrase , which has been carried to such perfection , that in acquiring through the medium of another a knowledge of the distinctive moral features of our fellow mortals , it is by no means necessary to devote hours to query and response . An intelligent witness can convey to us the essence of a character in a breath ; a flourish of the tongue will sketch a portrait , and place it , varnished and framed , in our mental picture gallery . The colours will , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the resemblance abundantly compensates for deficiency of finish . If , for instance , we are briefly told that Mr. Plinlimmon is a " cake , " the word may be derided as a cant appellation ; the ultra-fastidious may turn up their noses at it as a slang phrase ; but volumes could not render our knowledge of the man more perfect . We have him as it were , upon a salver , weak , unwholesome , and insipid  --  suited to the fancy , perhaps , of the very youthful , but by no means qualified for association with the bold , the mature , and the enterprising . When we hear that a personage is classed by competent judges among the " spoons , " we do not of course expect to find him shining in the buffet ; but we are satisfied that in action he must figure merely as an instrument . There are likewise , in this method of painting to the ear , the nicest shades of difference , often represented and made intelligible solely by the change of a letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good easy soul , and " saft " intimating that his disposition takes rank in the superlative degree of mollification . When danger 's to be confronted , who would rashly rely upon a " skulk ? " or , under any circumstances , ask worldly advice of those verdant worthies known among their contemporaries as decidedly " green ? " Such words are the mystic cabala ; they are the key to individuality , throwing open a panoramic view of the man , and foreshadowing his conduct in any supposed emergency . Therefore , when we speak of Tippleton Tipps as a " whole-souled fellow , " the acute reader will find an inkling of biography in the term  --  he will understand that Tippleton is likely to be portrayed as " no one 's enemy but his own "  --  and from that will have a glimpse of disastrous chances , of hairbreadth ' scapes , and of immediate or prospective wreck . According to the popular acceptation of the phrase , a " whole-soul " is a boiler without a safety valve , doomed sooner or later to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making an aperture : the puncture , however , being effected , the soul is a whole-soul no longer . It must therefore be confessed that Tippleton Tipps has not thus been bored by wisdom . He has a prompt alacrity at a " blow-out " and has been skyed in a " blow-up , " two varieties of the blow which frequently follow each other so closely as to be taken for cause and effect . Tippleton Tipps , as his soubriquet imports , is one of those who rarely become old , and are so long engaged in sowing their wild oats as to run to seed themselves , never fructifying in the way of experience , unless it be , like Bardolph , in the region of the nose . Before the condensing process was applied to language , he would probably have been called a dissipated , unsteady rogue , who walked in the broad path which furnishes sea-room for eccentricities of conduct ; but in these labour-saving times , he rejoices in the milder , but quite as descriptive title of a whole-souled fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jollity . It is , however , no honorary distinction , to be gained without toil or danger . The road is steep and thorny , and though in striving to reach the topmost height , there is no necessity for burning the midnight oil in the retired study , yet the midnight lamp , and many of the lamps which beam between the noon of night and morning , are often incidentally smashed in the process . Aspirants for other academic glories become pale with application and protracted vigils , but the whole-souled fellow will outwatch the lynx , and , if his cheek be blanched , the colour is made up in another portion of his visage . He is apt to be as " deeply red " as any one , though the locality of his acquirements may be different . The strict derivation of the title acquired by Tippleton  --  the W. S. F. by which he is distinguished  --  is not easily to be traced . There is , however , a vulgar belief that the philosopher who devotes himself to profound investigations , whether theoretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those of the Tippses , is not altogether free from flaw in the region of the occiput , and hence , as the schoolman has the sutures of his cranium caulked with latinized degrees , and as one should always have something whole about him , fancy and charity combined give the fast-livers credit for a " wholesoul . " Now , Tippleton Tipps always lived uncommonly fast . He is in fact remarkable for free action and swift travel , existing regularly at the rate of sixteen miles an hour under a trot , and can go twenty in a gallop . He sleeps fast , talks fast , eats fast , drinks fast , and , that he may get on the faster , seldom thinks at all . It is an axiom of his that thinking , if not " an idle waste of thought , " is a very leaden business  --  one must stop to think , which wastes time and checks enterprise . He reprobates it as much as he does poring over books , an employment which he regards as only calculated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and to spoil the originality of his ideas . A whole-souled fellow knows every thing intuitively  --  what is reason with others , is instinct in him . When Tippleton was quite a little boy , his moral idiosyncrasy manifested itself in a very decisive way . His generosity was remarkable ; he was never known to pause in giving away the playthings belonging to his brothers and sisters ; and his disinterestedness was such that he never hesitated an instant in breaking or losing his own , if sure of repairing the deficit by foraging upon others . No sordid impulse prevented a lavish expenditure of his pennies , and as soon as they were gone he " financiered " with the same liberality by borrowing from his little friends , never offending their delicacy by an offer to return the loan ,  --  a blunder into which meaner spirits sometimes fall . When that statesmanlike expedient would no longer answer , he tried the great commercial system upon a small scale , by hypothecating with the apple and pie woman the pennies he was to receive , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There being many apple women and likewise many pie women , he extended his business in this whole-souled sort of a way , and skilfully avoiding the sinking of more pennies than actually necessary to sustain his credit , he prospered for some time in the eating line . But as every thing good is sure to have an end , the apple and pie system being at last blown out tolerably large , Tippleton exploded with no assets . By way of a moral lesson , his father boxed his ears and refused to settle with his creditors ,  --  whereupon Tippleton concluded that the sin lay altogether in being found out ,  --  while his mother kissed him , gave him a half dollar , and protested that he had the spirit of a prince and ought not to be snubbed . As the spirit of a prince is a fine thing , it was cherished accordingly , and Tippleton spent his cash and laughed at the pie women . The home department of his training being thus carefully attended to , Tippleton went to a variety of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and mosaicked his education by remaining long enough to learn the branches of mischief indigenous to each , when , either because he had outstripped his teacher , or because his whole-soul had become too large , he was invariably requested to resign , receiving on all of these interesting occasions the cuff paternal and the kiss maternal , the latter being accompanied , as usual , with a reinforcement to his purse and a plaudit to his spirit . Tippleton then took a turn at college , where he received the last polish before the premature notice to quit was served upon him ; and at seventeen he was truly " whole-souled , " playing billiards as well as any " pony " in the land , and boxing as scientifically as the " deaf ' un . " He could owe everybody with a grace peculiar to himself ; kick up the noisiest of all possible rows at the theatre , invariably timed with such judgment as to make a tumultuous rush at the most interesting part of the play ; he could extemporize a fracas at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church stove . The most accomplished young man about town was Tippleton Tipps , and every year increased his acquirements . Time rolled on ; the elder Tippses left the world for their offspring to bustle in , and Tippleton , reaching his majority , called by a stretch of courtesy the age of discretion , received a few thousands as his outfit in manhood . He , therefore , resolved to set up for himself , determined to be a whole-souled fellow all the time , instead of , as before , acting in that capacity after business hours . " Now , " said Tipps , exultingly , " I 'll see what fun is made of  --  now I 'll enjoy life  --  now I 'll be a man ! " And , acting on that common impression , which , however , is not often borne out by the result , that when the present means are exhausted something miraculous will happen to recruit the finances , Tippleton commenced operations ,  --  stylish lodgings , a " high trotting horse , " buggy , and all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was under weigh , and plenty of friends forth with clustered around him , volunteering their advice , and lending their aid to enable him to support the character of a whole-souled fellow in the best and latest manner . Wherever his knowledge happened to be deficient , Diggs " put him up " to this , Twiggs " put him up " to that , and Sniggs " put him up " to t' other , and Diggs , Twiggs , and Sniggs gave him the preference whenever they wanted a collateral security or a direct loan . Thus , Tippleton not only had the pleasure of their company at frolics given by himself , but had likewise the advantage of being invited by them to entertainments for which his own money paid . " Clever is hardly a name for you , Tippleton , " said Diggs , using the word in its cis-atlantic sense . " No back-out in him , " mumbled Sniggs , with unwonted animation . " The whole-souled'st fellow I ever saw , " chimed Twiggs . Tippleton had just furnished his satellites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for then he was yet rather " flush . " " Give me Tippleton anyhow , " said Diggs ,  --  " he 's all sperrit . " " And no mistake , " chimed Sniggs . " He wanted it himself , I know he did , " ejaculated Twiggs , " but , whole-souled fellow  --  " and Twiggs buttoned his pocket on the needful , and squinted through the shutters at the tailor 's boy and the bootmaker 's boy , who walked suspiciously away from the door , as if they did n't believe that Tippleton Tipps , Esq . Dr. To sundries as per account rendered , was " not in . " Tailors ' boys , and shoemakers ' boys , and indeed , bill-bearing boys in general , are matter-of-factish incredulous creatures at best , and have no respect for the poetic licenses ; they are not aware that wholesouled people , like the mysterious ball of those ingenious artists the " thimble riggers , " who figure upon the sward on parade days , race days , hanging days , and other popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case require . But what would not Tippleton do to maintain his reputation ? While he had the means , let borrowers be as plenty as blackberries , they had only to pronounce the " open sesame " to have their wishes gratified , even if Tippleton himself were obliged to borrow to effect so desirable an object . The black looks of landlords and landladies , the pertinacities of mere business creditors , what are they , when the name of a whole-souled fellow is at stake ? Would they have such a one sink into the meanness of giving the preference to engagements which bring no credit except upon books ? Is selfishness so predominant in their natures ? If so , they need not look to be honoured by the Tippleton Tippses with the light of their countenance , or the sunshine of their patronage . There is not a Tipps in the country who would lavish interviews upon men or the representatives of men , who have so little sympathy with the owners of whole-souls . To such , the answer will invariably be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea , " said Diggs . " Surprising , " said Tippleton moodily . " A splendid idea  --  a fortune-making idea for you , " continued Diggs . Now , it so happened that Tippleton was just in that situation in which the prospect of a fortune is a " splendid idea , " even to a " whole-souled fellow . " His funds were exhausted  --  his credit pumped dry ; the horse and buggy had been sequestered , " and something miraculous " in the shape of relief had not happened . In fact , affairs were in that desperate condition which offers no resource but the dreadful one of suicide , or that still more dreadful alternative , going to work ,  --  running away without the means being a matter of impossibility . " As how ? " interrogated Tippleton dubiously , he having but little faith in the money-making schemes broached by Diggs , that individual 's talent lying quite in another direction . " As how ? " chorussed Sniggs and Twiggs , who , as hard run as their compatriots , snuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready at their call . " You must marry , " added Diggs . " Get thee a wife , Tippleton . " " Ah ! that would improve the matter amazingly , and be quite a profitable speculation , " replied Tippleton ironically . " To be sure  --  why not ? What 's to prevent a good looking , whole-souled fellow like you from making a spec ?  --  Grimson 's daughter , for instance  --  not pretty , but plaguey rich  --  only child  --  what 's to hinder  --  eh ? " " Yes  --  what 's to hinder ? " said Twiggs and Sniggs , looking at each other , and then at Tippleton  --  " wholesouled  --  good looking  --  and all that  --  just what the girls like . " " Perhaps they do , but papas do not , " said Tippleton , with a meditating look ; " as for old Grimson , he hates ' em . " " Very like ; but you do n't want to marry Grimson  --  get the daughter , and the father follows  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why make an impression upon Miss Jemima first  --  then shave off your whiskers , uncurl your hair , put your hat straight on your head , and swear to a reform  --  quit fun , go to bed early  --  very hard certainly , but when matters are once properly secured , then you know  --  ha ! ha ! " and Twiggs sportively knocked Tippleton in the ribs . " Ha ! ha ! " laughed Twiggs and Sniggs , poking each other in the same anatomical region . Although Tippleton had but little fancy for matrimony in general , or for Miss Jemima Grimson in particular , yet under the circumstances , he felt disposed to venture on the experiment and to try what could be done . He therefore continued the conversation , which happened late one night in a leading thoroughfare , and which was interrupted in a strange , startling manner . An intelligent " hem ! " given in that peculiar tone which intimates that the utterer has made a satisfactory discovery , seemed to issue from a neighbouring tree-box , and as Messrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their astonished regards toward the suspected point , a head decorated with a straw hat  --  a very unseasonable article at the time , and more unseasonable from its lidlike top , which opened and shut at each passing breeze  --  protruded from the shelter . " Ahem ! " repeated the head , seeming to speak with " most miraculous organ , " the wintry blast lifting up the hat-crown and letting it fall again , as if it were the mouth of some nondescript  --  " Ahem ! I like the speckilation myself , and I must either be tuck in as a pardener or I 'll peach . I knows old Grimsings  --  he lent me a kick and a levy t' other day , and if I do n't see good reason to the contrayry , I mean to stick up fur him . It 's a prime speckilation fur me every-vich-vay . " The conspirators were astonished , as well they might be , at the sudden and unexpected apparition among them of another " whole-souled fellow " with a dilapidated hat . The stranger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the members of which have been conspicuous in all ages  --  it was Richard , known to his familiars by the less respectful , but certainly more affectionate appellation of " Dicky Dout . " He is a man of fine feelings and very susceptible susceptibilities , being of that peculiar temperament which is generally understood to constitute genius , and possessing that delicate organization which is apt to run the head of its owner against stone walls , and prompts him on all occasions to put his fingers in the fire . He has , therefore , like his illustrious progenitors , a strong affinity for " looped and windowed raggedness , " and rather a tendency toward a physical method of spiritualizing the grosser particles of the frame . But for once , Dout was sharpened for " speckilation . " " I 'm to go sheers , " added Dout , as if it were a settled thing . " Sheer off , you impudent rascal ! " ejaculated the party . " Oh , I do n't mind sass , " replied he , seating himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only tail which remained to his coat  --  " Cuss as much as you please  --  it wo n't skeer wot I know out o ' me . Do n't hurt yourself , said Carlo to the kitten . I 'll see Grimsings in the morning , if I ai n't agreeable here  --  I 'm to have fust every and a shot this time , as the boys says ven they 're playin ' of marvels . Let them knuckle down close as ca n't help it , " concluded Dout , as he whistled and rubbed his shin , and remarked that when " sot upon a thing he was raal lignum witey . " " Tippleton ! " said Diggs . " Well ? " replied Tippleton . " A fix ! " " Ra-a-ther . " " Nullum go-um , " added Sniggs , who prided himself upon his classical knowledge . " E pluribum uniber , if you come to that , " interjected Dout . " We 're caught , " added Twiggs , who dealt largely in French ; " we 're caught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? " inquired Tippleton . " To be sure , " replied Dout  --  " we whole-souled fellers knows everybody in the same line of business . " This was decidedly a check  --  the speculators were outgeneralled by the genius of the Douts ; so making a virtue of necessity , they mollified him by a slight douceur scraped up at the time , and large promises for the future . Dicky was forthwith installed as boot-cleaner and coat-brusher to the party , as well as recipient of old clothes , under condition of keeping tolerably sober and very discreet . Peace being thus concluded , Tippleton Tipps commenced the campaign against the heart of Miss Jemima Grimson , who liked whole-souled fellows , and began the work of ingratiating himself with his father 's old friend Mr. Grimson , who cordially disliked whole-souled fellows . In the first place , therefore , he ceased to associate publicly with Diggs , Sniggs , and Twiggs , and contented himself with chuckling with them in private . He silenced his creditors by demonstrating to them that he was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances upon the prospect , wherewith to keep himself in trim and to nourish Dicky Dout . Miss Jemima was delighted , for Tippleton had such a way with him ; while Mr. Grimson 's unfavourable impressions gradually vanished before his professions of reform and improved conduct . The old gentleman employed him as a clerk , and had a strong inclination either to " set him up " or to " take him in . " " Such a correct , sensible young man has he become , " quoth Grimson . Things were thus beautifully en train , when Mr. Grimson rashly sent his protege with a sum of money to be used in a specified way in a neighbouring city , and the protege , who longed to indulge himself in that which he classically termed a " knock-around , " took his allies Diggs , Sniggs , and Twiggs with him . The " cash proper " being expended  --  the wine being in and the wit being out  --  Tippleton being a whole-souled fellow , and his companions knowing it , the " cash improper " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days of roaring mirth , they returned rather dejected and disheartened . " Come , what 's the use of sighing ? " roared Tippleton , as they sat dolorously in a snug corner at the headquarters of the whole-souled fellows . " The money 's not quite out  --  Champagne ! " " Bravo , Tippleton ! " responded his companions , and the corks flew merrily  --  " That 's the only way to see one 's road out of trouble . " " Another bottle , Dout !  --  that for Grimson ! " shouted Tipps , snapping his fingers  --  " I 'll run off with his daughter  --  what do you say to that , Dicky Dout ? " Dicky dodged the cork which was flirted at him , and regarding the company with a lugubrious air , observed : " Accordin ' to me , gettin ' corned 's no way  --  there 's only two business sitiations in which it 's allowable  --  one 's when you 're so skeered you ca n't tell what to do , and the other 's when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nothin '  --  when you 're goin ' , and when you 're gone  --  it makes you go by a sort of a slant , instead of a bumping tumble . It eases a feller down like a tayckle , when on temperance principles he 'd break his neck . For my part , I think this bustin ' of yourn looks bad "  --  Dicky filled a glass and drained its contents  --  " ' specially when you 're goin ' it on crab-apple cider . " " Get out , Dicky Dout !  --  Fetch some cigars , Dicky Dout ! " The party sang songs , the party made speeches , and the party rapidly drank up the remainder of Mr. Grimson 's cash , a catastrophe which in their present state of mind did not trouble them at all , except when they remembered that no more money , no more wine . Boniface was used to dealing with whole-souled fellows . " Order , gentlemen ! " said Tipps , rising to deliver an address  --  " I do n't get upon my feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen , of any member present ; but merely to state that there are facts  --  primary facts , like a kite , and contingent facts , like bob-tails  --  one set of facts that hang on to another set of facts "  --  and Tippleton grasped the table to support himself . " The first of these facts is , that in looking out at the window I see snow  --  I likewise hear sleigh-bells , from which we have the bob-tailed contingent that we ought to go a sleighing to encourage domestic manufactures . " " Hurra ! " said Diggs and Sniggs  --  " let 's go a sleighing ! " " Hurray ! " muttered Twiggs , who sat drowsing over an extinguished cigar and an empty glass  --  " let 's go a Maying ! " " I have stated , gentlemen , " continued Tipps , swaying to and fro , and endeavouring to squeeze a drop from a dry bottle  --  " several facts , but there is another  --  a further contingent  --  the sleighing may be good , and we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no money ! That 's what I call an appalling fact , in great staring capitals  --  the money 's gone , the Champagne 's gone , but though we made ' em go , we ca n't go ourselves ! " Tippleton Tipps sank into his chair , and added , as he sucked at his cigar with closed eyes : " Capitalists desiring to contract will please send in their terms , sealed and endorsed Proposals to loan . " ' " Cloaks , watches , and breast-pins  --  spout ' em , " hinted Dout from a corner . " We whole-souled people always plant sich articles in sleighing-time , and let 's ' em crop out in the spring . " The hint was taken . As the moon rose , a sleigh whizzed rapidly along the street , and as it passed , Tippleton Tipps was seen bestriding it like a Colossus , whirling his arms as if they were the fans of a windmill , and screaming " ' T is my delight of a shiny night ! " in which his associates , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all their vocal power . " ' T was merry in the parlor , ' t was merry in the hall , " when Tippleton , cum suis , alighted at a village inn . Fiddles were playing and people were dancing all over the house , and the new arrivals did not lose time in adding to the jovial throng . Tippleton , seizing the barmaid 's cap , placed it on his own head , and using the shovel and tongs for the apparatus of a fiddler , danced and played on top of the table , while Dout beat the door by way of a drum , and Diggs , Sniggs , and Twiggs disturbed the " straight fours " of the company in the general assembly-room by a specimen of the Winnebago wardance , the whole being accompanied by whoopings after the manner of the aborigines . The clamor drew the " select parties " into the passages to see the latest arrivals from Pandemonium . " Who cares for Grimson ? " said Tipps , as he fiddled and sung the following choice morceau from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father-in-law to me was cross ; Oh ' t was neither for the better , nor yet for the worse ; He neither would give me a cow nor a horse , "  --  when Mr. Grimson and Miss Jemima Grimson from the " select parties " stood before him . " So , Mr. Tippleton Tipps , this is your reform ! be pleased to follow me , and give an account of the business intrusted to your charge , " said Mr. Grimson sternly . " Ha ! ha ! " laughed Tippleton , fiddling up to him  --  " business  --  pooh ! Dance , my old buck , dance like a whole-souled fellow  --  like me  --  dance , Jemimy , it may make you pretty  --  " He neither would give me a cow nor a horse . " Mr. Grimson turned indignantly on his heel , and Miss Jemima Grimson , frowning volumes of disdain at seeing her lover thus attired and thus disporting himself , and at hearing him thus contumelious to her personal charms , gave him what is poetically termed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room leaning on her father 's arm . " Ha ! ha ! " said Tippleton , continuing to fiddle . " The speckilation 's got the grippe , " added Dout . It was nearly morning when a pair of horses , with the fragments of a sleigh knocking about their heels , dashed wildly into Millet 's stable yard . They were the ponies which had drawn Tippleton Tipps and his cohort ; but where were those worthy individuals ? At the corner of a street , where the snow and water had formed a delusive compound as unstable as the Goodwin sands , lay Tippleton half " smothered in cream "  --  ice cream , while " his lovely companions " were strewed along the wayside at various intervals , according to the tenacity of their grasp . " The tea party 's spilt , " said Dicky Dout , as he went feeling among the snow with a fragment of the wreck , and at length forked up Tippleton , as if he were a dumpling in a bowl of soup . The tableau was striking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head upon his knee , trying to rub a little life into him . It was a second edition of Marmion and Clara de Clare at Flodden field , the Lord of Fontenaye and Tippleton Tipps both being at the climax of their respective catastrophes . " Ah ! " said Dout , heaving a deep sigh as he rubbed away at his patient 's forehead , as if it were a boot to clean , " this night has been the ruination of us all  --  we 're smashed up small and sifted through . Here lies Mr. Tipps in a predicary  --  and me and the whole on ' em is little better nor a flock of gone goslings . It 's man 's natur ' , I believe , and we ca n't help it no how . As fur me , I wish I was a pig  --  there 's some sense in being a pig wot 's fat ; pigs do n't have to speckilate and bust  --  pigs never go a sleighing , quarrel with their daddies-in-law wot was to be , get into sprees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent behaved people and good citizens , though they ai n't got no wote . And then they have n't got no clothes to put on of cold mornings when they get up ; they do n't have to be darnin ' and patchin ' their old pants ; they do n't wear no old hats on their heads , nor have to ask people for ' em  --  cold wittles is plenty for pigs . My eyes ! if I was a jolly fat pig belonging to respectable people , it would be tantamount to nothin ' with me who was president . Who ever see 'd one pig a settin ' on a cold curbstone a rubbin ' another pig 's head wot got chucked out of a sleigh ? Pigs has too much sense to go a ridin ' if so be as they can help it . I wish I was one , and out of this scrape . It 's true , " continued Dout thoughtfully , and pulling Tippleton 's nose till it cracked at the bridge-joint ,  --  " it 's true that pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dogs bites ' em , and pigs is sometimes almost as done-over suckers as men ; but pigs never runs their own noses into scrapes , coaxin ' themselves to believe it 's fun , as we do . I never see a pig go the whole hog in my life , ' sept upon rum cherries . I 'm thinkin ' Mr. Tipps is defunct ; he sleeps as sound as if it was time to get up to breakfast . " But Tipps slowly revived ; he rolled his glassy eye wildly , the other being , as it were , " put up for exportation , " or " bunged " as they have it in the vernacular . " Mister Tipps , " said Dout , " do you know what 's the matter ? " " Fun 's the matter , is n't it ? " gasped Tipps ; " I 've been a sleighing , and we always do it so  --  it 's fun this way  --  but what 's become of my other eye ?  --  Where 's  --  stop  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and could n't stay  --  compliments to the folks , but ca n't sit down . " " Your t' other eye , " replied Dout , " as fur as I can see , is kivered up to keep ; the wire-edge is took considerable off your nose  --  your coat is split as if somebody wanted to make a pen of it , and your trousers is fractured .

It may be a truism , yet we can not help recording it as our deliberate opinion , that life is begirt with troubles . The longer we live , the more we are convinced of the fact  --  solidly , sincerely convinced ; especially in cold weather , when all evils are doubled , and great annoyances are reinforced by legions of petty vexations . The happiest conditions of existence  --  among which it is usual to class matrimony  --  are not without their alloy . There is a principle of equity always at work , and , therefore , where roses strew the path , thorns are sharpest and most abundant . Were it otherwise , frail humanity might at times forget its mortal nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of the fact  --  and grow altogether too extensive for its nether integuments . A stronger proof that " there 's naught but care on every hand , " and that it is often nearest when least expected , could not be found , than in the case of Gamaliel Gambril the cobbler , an influential and well known resident of Ringbone Alley , a section of the city wherein he has " a voice potential , double as the Duke 's . " Gamaliel 's Christmas gambols  --  innocent as he deemed them  --  terminated in the revolt of his household , a species of civil war which was the more distressing to him as it came like a cloud after sunshine , darker and more gloomy from the preceding light . It is often thus with frail humanity . The keenest vision can not penetrate the contracted circle of the present , and give certain information of the future . Who , that sets forth to run a rig , can tell in what that rig may end ? The laughing child , unconscious of mishap , pursues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , proud of his whiskers , his experience , and his foresight , will yet follow that phantom felicity until he gets into a scrape . The highways and the byways of existence are filled with man-traps and spring-guns , and happy he whose activity is so great that he can dance among them with uninjured ankles , and escape scot-free . That faculty , which to a man of a sportive turn of mind is more precious than rubies , is denied to Gamaliel Gambril . When convivially inclined , he is a Napoleon , whose every battle-field is a Waterloo  --  a Santa Anna , whose San Jacintos are innumerable . It was past the noon of night , and the greater part of those who had beds to go to , had retired to rest . Light after light had ceased to flash from the windows , and every house was in darkness , save where a faintly burning candle in the attic told that Sambo or Dinah had just finished labour , and was about enjoying the sweets of repose , or where a fitful flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that young Hopeful was still abroad at his revels . It seemed that the whole city and liberties were in bed , and the active imagination of the solitary stroller through the streets could not avoid painting the scene . He figured to himself the two hundred thousand human creatures who dwell within those precincts , lying prone upon their couches  --  couches varied as their fortunes , and in attitudes more varied than either  --  some , who are careless of making a figure in the world , with their knees drawn up to their chins ; the haughty and ostentatious stretched out to their full extent ; the ambitious , the sleeping would-be Csars , spread abroad like the eagle on a sign , or a chicken split for the gridiron , each hand and each foot reaching toward a different point of the compass ; the timid rolled up into little balls , with their noses just peeping from under the clothes ; and the valiant with clenched fists and bosoms bare  --  for character manifests itself by outward signs , both in our sleeping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculative watcher has ears as well as eyes , the varied music which proceeds from these two hundred thousand somnolent bodies will vibrate upon his tympanum  --  the dulcet flute-like snoring which melodiously exhales from the Phidian nose of the sleeping beauty ; the querulous whining of the nervous papa ; the warlike startling snort of mature manhood , ringing like a trumpet call , and rattling the window glass with vigorous fury ; the whistling , squeaking , and grunting of the eccentric ; and , in fine , all the diversified sounds with which our race choose to accompany their sacrifices to Morpheus . But though so many were in bed , there were some who should have been in bed who were not there . On this very identical occasion , when calmness seemed to rule the hour , the usually quiet precincts of Ringbone Alley were suddenly disturbed by a tremendous clatter . But loud as it was , the noise for a time continued unheeded . The inhabitants of that locality  --  who are excellent and prudent citizens , and always , while they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their digestive organs  --  worn out by the festivities of the season , and somewhat oppressed with a feverish head-ache , the consequence thereof , were generally asleep ; and , with no disposition to flatter , or to assume more for them than they are entitled to , it must be conceded that the Ringboners , when they tie up their heads and take off their coats to it , are capital sleepers  --  none better . They own no relationship to those lazy , aristocratic dozers , who seem to despise the wholesome employment of slumbering , and , instead of devoting their energies to the task , amuse themselves with counting the clock , and with idly listening to every cry of fire  --  who are afraid to trust themselves unreservedly to the night , and are so suspicious of its dusky face , and so doubtful of the fidelity of the " sentinel stars , " as to watch both night and stars . Unlike this nervous race , the Ringboners have in general nothing to tell when they assemble round the breakfast table . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rest ; for their rest has no bad to it . They neither hear the shutters slam in the night , nor are they disturbed by mysterious knockings about three in the morning . They do not , to make others ashamed of their honest torpidity , ask , " Where was the fire ? " and look astonished that no one heard the alarm . On the contrary , when they couch themselves , they are only wide enough awake to see the candle out of the corner of one eye , and nothing is audible to them between the puff which extinguishes the light and the call to labour at the dawn . When their heads touch the pillow , their optics are closed and their mouths are opened . Each proboscis sounds the charge into the land of Nod , and like Eastern monarchs , they slumber to slow music , Ringbone Alley being vocal with one tremendous snore . No wonder that such a praiseworthy people , so circumstanced , should not be easily awakened by the noise before alluded to . But the disturbance grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big dogs yawned and bayed ; the monopolizing cats , who like nobody 's noise but their own , whisked their tails and flew through the cellar windows in dismay . The alley , which , like Othello , can stand most things unmoved , was at last waking up , and not a few night-capped heads projected like whitewashed artillery through the embrasures of the upper casements , dolefully and yawnfully " vanting to know vot vos the row ? " The opening of Gamaliel Gambril 's front door answered the question . He and his good lady were earnestly discussing some problem of domestic economy  --  some knotty point as to the reserved rights of parties to the matrimonial compact . It soon , however , became evident that the husband 's reasoning , if not perfectly convincing , was too formidable and weighty to be resisted . Swift as the flash , Madam Gambril dashed out of the door , while Gamaliel , like " panting time , toiled after her in vain , " flourishing a strap in one hand and a broom in the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something unusual was the matter with Gamaliel . His intellectual superstructure had , by certain unknown means , become too heavy for his physical framework . Mind was triumphing over matter , and , as was to be expected , matter proving weak , the immortal mind had many tumbles ; but still , rolling , tumbling , and stumbling , Gamaliel , like Alpheus , pursued his Arethusa ; not until the flying fair was metamorphosed into a magic stream , but until he pitched into an urban water-course of a less poetic nature , which checked his race , while its waves soothed and measurably tranquillized his nervous system . At the catastrophe , Mrs. Gambril ceased her flight , but after the manner of the Cossacks of the Don , or the Mahratta cavalry , kept circling round the enemy  --  out of striking distance , yet within hail . " Gammy Gambril , " said she , appealing to the argumentum ad hominem , in reply to that ad baculum from which she fled  --  " Gammy , you 're a mere warmunt  --  a pitiful warmunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days and nights , and still no money !  --  now you are come , what do you fetch ?  --  a tipsy cobbler ! Hot corn is good for something , and so is corned beef ; but I 'd like to know what 's the use of a corned cobbler ? " " Corneycopey for ever ! It 's merry Christmas and happy New Year , old woman ! " said Gambril , raising himself with great difficulty to a sitting posture ; " and I 'll larrup you like ten thousand , if you 'll only come a little nearer . Ask for money on a Christmas !  --  it 's too aggrawatin ' !  --  it 's past endurin ' ! I 'm bin jolly myself  --  I 'm jolly now , and if you ai n't jolly , come a little nearer and flourishing the strap I 'll make you jolly . " Much conversation of a similar tenor passed between the parties ; but as the argument continued the same , no new ideas were elicited , until Montezuma Dawkins , a near neighbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequence perhaps of being a bachelor  --  stepped out to put an end to the noise , which interfered materially with his repose . " Go home , Mrs. Gambril , " said Montezuma Dawkins soothingly ; and as she obeyed , he turned to Mr. Gambril , and remarked in a severe tone , " This ' ere 's too bad , Gammy  --  right is n't often done in the world ; but if you had your rights , you 'd be between the finger and thumb of justice  --  just like a pinch of snuff  --  you 'd be took . " Montezuma Dawkins prided himself on his legal knowledge , for he had made the fires in a magistrate 's office during a whole winter , and consequently was well qualified to lecture his neighbours upon their errors in practice . " Nonsense , " replied Gammy  --  " me took when it 's Christmas !  --  well I never !  --  did any body ever ?  --  I 'm be switch 'd  --  " " No swearing . This ' ere is a connubibal case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as straight as a loon 's leg on that pint . You do n't understand the law , I s'pose ? Well , after you 're growed up , and your real poppy  --  or your pa , as the people in Chestnut street would call him  --  ca n't keep you straight , because you can lick him , which is what they mean by being of age , then the law becomes your poppy , because it is n't so easy to lick the law . The law , then , allows you a wife ; but the law allows it in moderation , like any thing else . Walloping her is one of the little fondlings of the connubibal state ; but if it is n't done within doors , and without a noise , like taking a drop too much , why then it ai n't moderation , and the law steps in to stop intemperate amusements . Why do n't you buy a digestion of the laws , so as to know what 's right and what 's wrong ? It 's all sot down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't the first time I 've thought so by a long shot . If it was n't for the law , and for being married , a man might get along well enough . But now , first your wife aggrawates you , and then the law aggrawates you . I 'm in a state of aggrawation . " " That all comes from your not knowing law  --  them that do n't know it get aggrawated by it , but them that does know it only aggrawates other people . But you ignorantramusses are always in trouble , ' specially if you 're married . What made you get married if you do n't like it ? " " Why , I was deluded into it  --  fairly deluded . I had nothing to do of evenings , so I went a courting . Now , courting 's fun enough  --  I have n't got a word to say agin courting . It 's about as good a way of killing an evening as I know of . Wash your face , put on a clean dicky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an hour or two  --  to say nothing of a few kisses behind the door , as your sweetheart goes to the step with you . The fact is , I 've quite a taste and a genus for courting  --  it 's all sunshine , and no clouds . " " Well , if you like it so , why did n't you stick to it ; it 's easy enough ; court all the time , like two pretty people in a pickter . " " Not so easy as you think for ; they wo n't let a body court all the time  --  that 's exactly where the mischief lies . If you say A , they 'll make you say B. The young ' uns may stand it because they 're bashful sometimes , but the old ladies always interfere , and make you walk right straight up to the chalk , whether or no . Marry or cut stick  --  you must n't stand in other people 's moonshine . That 's the way they talked to me , and druv ' me right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  pooty fun to be sure ! " " Well , Gammy , I see clear enough you 're in a scrape ; but it 's a scrape accordin ' to law , and so you ca n't help your sad sitivation . You must make the best of it . Better go home and pacify the old lady  --  larrupings do n't do any good as I see  --  they 're not wholesome food for anybody except hosses and young children "  --  and Montezuma yawned drearily as if anxious to terminate the colloquy . " The fact is , Montey  --  to tell you a secret  --  I 've a great mind to walk off . I hate domestic uneasiness , and there 's more of that at my house than there is of eatables and drinkables by a good deal . I should like to leave it behind me . A man does n't want much when he gets experience and comes to look at things properly  --  he learns that the vally of wives and other extras is tantamount to nothing  --  it 's only essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor box , and as thirsty as a cart load of sand  --  not for water , though ; that 's said to be good for navigation and internal improvements , but it always hurts my wholesome , and I 'm principled against using the raw material  --  it 's bad for trade . I ca n't go home , even if there was any use in it ; and so I believe I 'll emigrate  --  I 'll be a sort of pinioneer , and fly away . " " It ca n't be allowed , Gammy Gambril . If you try it and do n't get off clear , the law will have you as sure as a gun  --  for this ' ere is one of them ' are pints of law what grabs hold of you strait  --  them husbands as cut stick must be made examples on . If they was n't , all the hebiddies in town would be cutting stick . To allow such cuttings up and such goings on is taking the mortar out of society and letting the bricks tumble down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the good of the rest of the people . The world 's like a flock of sheep , and if one runs crooked all the rest will be sure to do the same . " Gamaliel elevated his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders in contempt at the application of the abstract principle to his individual case , and then reverted to his original train of thought . After rising to his feet , he turned his eyes upward and struck a classical attitude . " Marrying fun ! " ejaculated he  --  " yes , pooty fun ! very pooty ! " " Keep a goin ' ahead , " said Montezuma Dawkins , poking him with a stick ,  --  " talk as you go , and let 's hear the rights of it . " " When I was a single man , the world wagged along well enough . It was jist like an omnibus : I was a passenger , paid my levy , and had n't nothing more to do with it but sit down and not care a button for any thing . S'posing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leaves the man to pick up the pieces . But then I must take a wife and be hanged to me . It 's all very well for a while ; but afterwards , it 's plaguy like owning an upsot omnibus . " " ' Nan ? " queried Montezuma  --  " What 's all that about omnibusses ? " " What did I get by it ? " continued Gamaliel , regardless of the interruption . " How much fun ?  --  why a jawing old woman and three squallers . Mighty different from courting that is . What 's the fun of buying things to eat and things to wear for them , and wasting good spreeing money on such nonsense for other people ? And then , as for doing what you like , there 's no such thing . You ca n't clear out when people 's owing you so much money you ca n't stay convenient . No  --  the nabbers must have you . You ca n't go on a spree ; for when you come home , missus kicks up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners  --  for constables are as thick as blackberries . In short , you ca n't do nothing . Instead of Yes , my duck , ' and No , my dear , '  --  As you please , honey , ' and When you like , lovey , ' like it was in courting times , it 's a riglar row at all hours . Sour looks and cold potatoes ; children and table-cloths bad off for soap  --  always darning and mending , and nothing ever darned and mended . If it was n't that I 'm partickelarly sober , I 'd be inclined to drink  --  it 's excuse enough . It 's heartbreaking , and it 's all owing to that I 've such a pain in my gizzard of mornings . I 'm so miserable I must stop and sit on the steps . " " What 's the matter now ? " " I 'm getting aggrawated . My wife 's a savin ' critter  --  a sword of sharpness  --  she cuts the throat of my felicity , stabs my happiness , chops up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make jackets for the boys  --  she gives all the wittels to the children , to make me spry and jump about like a lamp-lighter  --  I ca n't stand it  --  my troubles is overpowering when I come to add ' em up . " " Oh , nonsense ! behave nice  --  do n't make a noise in the street  --  be a man . " " How can I be a man , when I belong to somebody else ? My hours ai n't my own  --  my money ai n't my own  --  I belong to four people besides myself  --  the old woman and them three children . I 'm a partnership concern , and so many has got their fingers in the till that I must bust up . I 'll break , and sign over the stock in trade to you . " Montezuma , however , declined being the assignee in the case of the house of Gambril , and finally succeeded in prevailing upon him to abandon , at least for the present , his design of becoming a " pinioneer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gambril closed the door , he popped out his head , and cried aloud to his retiring friend , " I say , Montezuma Dawkins !  --  before you go  --  if you know anybody that wants a family complete to their hands , warranted to scold as loud and as long as any , I 'll sell cheap . I wo n't run away just yet , but I want cash , for I 'll have another jollification a New Year 's Eve , if I had as many families as I 've got fingers and toes ! " THE CROOKED DISCIPLE ; OR , THE PRIDE OF MUSCLE . Nature too frequently forgets to infuse the sympathies into the composition of the human race , and hence the world is afflicted with a flood of evils . Imperfect as mankind may be in a physical point of view , their moral defects are immeasurably greater , and these chiefly flow from the dearth of sympathy . Social offences , as well as crimes , are in general born from this cause , and the sins of humanity are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome plants in the garden of the heart , and exhausts the soil . It manifests itself in a variety of ways . In one instance , being combined with other essentials , it makes a mighty conqueror ; in another , a petty larcenist ; one man beats his wife and sots at an alehouse ; another sets the world in a blaze , and dying , becomes the idol of posterity ; all from the same cause  --  a mind concentred on itself . The forms which govern society were intended to counteract the aforesaid neglect of dame nature , and to keep selfishness in check ; it having been early discovered that if every one put his fingers in the dish at once , a strong chance existed that the contents thereof would be spilt , and all would be compelled to go home hungry . It was equally clear that if each individual tucked up his coat tails , and endeavoured to monopolize the fire , the whole company would be likely to catch cold . The canon was therefore issued that " after you " should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may be to get the biggest piece , he should not obey the promptings of nature by making a direct grab ; but rather effect his object by indirect management  --  such as placing the desired morsel nearest himself , and then handing the plate  --  a species of hocus pocus , which puts the rest of the company in the vocative , and enables the skill of civilization quietly to effect that which in earlier times could only be accomplished by superior force , and at the hazard of upsetting the table . If sympathy were the growth of every mind , politeness and deference would be spontaneous ; but as it is not , a substitute  --  a sort of wooden leg for the natural one  --  was invented , and hence " dancing and manners " are a part of refined education . Wine glasses are placed near the decanter , and tumblers near the pitcher , that inclination may receive a broad hint , and that the natural man may not rob the rest of the company of their share of comfort , by catching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the dinner table to intimate that , however hungry one may be , it is not the thing to jump upon the board , and , clutching the whole pig , to gnaw it as a school-boy does an apple ; while plates , with their attendant knives and forks , show that each one must be content with a portion , and use his pickers and stealers as little as possible . To get along smoothly , it was also ordained that we must smile when it would be more natural to tumble the intruder out of the window ; and that no matter how tired we may be , we must not , when another is about taking our seat , pull it from under him , and allow him to bump on the floor . Although education has done much to supply deficiencies , and to make mock sympathy out of calves ' heads when the real article is not to be found , yet education , potent as it is , can not do all things . " Crooked disciples " will exist from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told of Jacob Grigsby . Of crooked disciples , Jacob Grigsby is the crookedest . His disposition is twisted like a ram 's horn , and none can tell in what direction will be the next turn . He is an independent abstraction  --  one of that class , who do not seem aware that any feelings are to be consulted but their own , and who take the last bit , as if unconscious that it is consecrated to that useful divinity " manners ; " lads , who always run in first when the bell rings , and can not get their boots off when any body tumbles overboard ; who , when compelled to share their bed with another , lie in that engrossing posture called " cattycornered , " and when obliged to rise early , whistle , sing and dance , that none may enjoy the slumbers denied to them ;  --  in short , he strongly resembles that engaging species of the human kind , who think it creditable to talk loud at theatres and concerts , and to encore songs and concertos which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that the rest of the world , animate or inanimate , was constructed simply for his special amusement , and that if it did not answer the purpose , it was his indefeasible right to declare war against the offender . When a boy , he was known as a " real limb "  --  of what tree it is unnecessary to specify . He was an adept in placing musk melon rinds on the pavement for the accommodation of those elderly gentlemen whose skating days were over , and many a staid matron received her most impressive lessons in ground and lofty tumbling , by the aid of cords which he had stretched across the way . Every child in the neighbourhood learnt to " see London " through his telescope , and he was famous for teaching youngsters to write hog Latin by jerking pens full of ink through their lips . At school he was remarkable for his science in crooking pins , and placing them on the seats of the unsuspicious , and ever since he has continued to be a thorn in the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Grigsby has now grown to man 's estate  --  a small property in most instances , and in his it must be simply the interest of his whiskers , which extend some inches beyond his nose and chin  --  he having nothing else clear of embarrassment . He is said to be more of a limb than ever , his unaccommodating spirit having increased with his trunk . The good qualities which were to appear in him are yet in the soil , no sprouts having manifested themselves . He is savagely jocular in general , and jocosely quarrelsome in his cups in particular . He stands like a bramble in life 's highway , and scratches the cuticle from all that passes . This amiable individual is particularly fond of cultivating his physical energies , and one of his chief delights is in the display of his well practised powers . He sometimes awakens a friend from a day dream , by a slap on the shoulder which might be taken for the blow of a cannon ball . His salutation is accompanied by a grasp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of his affectionate disposition and the strength of his friendship for a week afterwards ; and he smiles to see his victims writhe under a clutch which bears no little resemblance in its pressure to the tender embrace of a smith 's vice . To this Herculean quality Grigsby always recurs with satisfaction , and indeed it must be confessed that superiority , either real or imagined , is a great source of pleasure in this mundane sphere . There are few who do not derive satisfaction from believing that , in some respect , they are more worthy than their neighbours  --  and self-love , if the truth were known , performs many curious operations to enable its possessor to enjoy the delight of thinking that there are points in which he is unsurpassed . Should his countenance be of the most unprepossessing cast , he gazes in the mirror until convinced that whatever is lost in beauty , is gained in expression . Should he have a temper as rash and unreasonable as the whirlwind , it is to him but a proof of superior susceptibility and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he possesses a free unencumbered spirit ; and if nature has provided him with a superabundance of flesh , he comforts himself with the idea of an imposing aspect , and of being able , physically at least , to make a figure in the world . The melancholy man , instead of charging his nervous system with treachery , or his stomach with disaffection , finds a stream of sunshine in his gloom , from the impression that it is left to him alone to see reality divested of its deceptive hues  --  and smiles sourly on the merry soul who bears it as if existence were a perpetual feast , and as if he were a butterfly upon an ever-blooming prairie . The pride of art likewise comes in as a branch of this scheme of universal comfort . The soldier and the politician rejoice in their superior skill in tactics and strategie  --  and even if foiled , charge the result upon circumstances beyond their control ; while even the scavenger plumes himself upon the superior skill and accuracy with which he can execute the fancy work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride of which we speak more strongly than those who are addicted to the practice of gymnastics . They have it in every muscle of their frames ; their very coats are buttoned tight across the breast to express it ; and it is exhibited on every possible occasion . In their dwellings , wo upon the tables and chairs  --  and they can not see a pair of parallels or cross bars without experimenting upon them . At a period when Grigsby was in the full flush of his gymnastic powers , he returned from a supper late at night , with several companions . After Grigsby had created much polite amusement by torturing several dogs and sundry pigs , they attempted a serenade , but they were not in voice ; and after trying a cotillion and a galopade in front of the State House , which were not quite so well executed as might have been desired , they separated , each to his home  --  if he could get there . Grigsby strolled along humming a tune , until his eye happened to be greeted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded it for a long time with critical gravity . " This will answer famously , " said he . " Tom brags that he can beat me with his arms ; but I do n't believe it . Any how , his legs are no great shakes . There 's no more muscle in them than there is in an unstarched shirt collar ; and I do n't believe , if he was to practise for ten years , he could hang by his toes , swing up and catch hold . No , that he could n't ; I 'm the boy , and I 'll exercise at it . " It is however much easier to resolve than to execute . Mr. Grigsby found it impossible to place himself in the requisite antipodean posture . " Why , what the deuse is the matter ? All the supper must have settled down in my toes , for my boots feel heavier than fifty-sixes . My feet are completely obfuscated , while my head is as clear as a bell . But never despair ' is the motto  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making another desperate but ineffectual effort . An individual with a white hat and with his hands deeply immersed in the pockets of his shooting jacket , now advanced from the tree against which he had been leaning , while chuckling at the doings of Mr. Grigsby . " Hay , whiskers , what 's the fun in doing that , particularly when you ca n't do it ? " said he . " Can you hang by your toes , stranger ? Because if you can , you 'll beat Tom , in spite of his bragging . " " I do n't believe I can . The fact is , I always try to keep this side up with care . I never could see the use of shaking a man up like a bottle of physic . I can mix myself to my own taste without that . " " You 've no taste for the fine arts , whatever you may have for yourself . Gymnastics stir up the sugar of a man 's constitution , and neutralize the acids . Without ' em , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but sour punch . " " Very likely , but I 'll have neither hand nor foot in hanging to an awning-post . If it was like the brewer 's horse in Old Grimes , and you could drink up all the beer by turning your head where your feet should be , perhaps I might talk to you about it . " Grigsby , however , by dint of expatiating on the beneficial tendency of gymnastics , at last prevailed upon the stranger to make the attempt . " Now , " said he , " let me bowse you up , and if you can hang by your toes , I 'll treat handsome . " " Well , I do n't care if I do , " replied the stranger with a grin , as he grasped the cross-bar  --  " hoist my heels and look sharp . " Jacob chuckled as he took the stranger by the boots , intending to give him a fall if possible , and to thrash him if he grumbled ; but the victim 's hold was insecure , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks together . " Fire and tow ! " ejaculated Grigsby . " Now we 're mixed nicely , " grunted the stranger , as he scrambled about . " If any man gets more legs and arms than belong to him , they 're mine . Hand over the odd ones , and let 's have a complete set . " This will never do , " said Grigsby , after they had regained their feet , and still intent on his design . " It will never do in the world  --  you 're so confoundely awkward . Come , have at it again ; once more and the last . " " Young people , " interposed a passing official , " if you keep a cutting didoes , I must talk to you both like a Dutch uncle . Each of you must disperse ; I ca n't allow no insurrection about the premises . If you ai n't got no dead-latch key , and the nigger wo n't set up , why I 'll take you to the corporation free-and-easy , and lock you up till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to converse with his honour on matters and things in general . " " Very well , " answered Grigsby  --  " but now you 've made your speech , do you think you could hang by your toes to that post ? " " Pooh ! pooh ! do n't be redikalis . When matters is solemn , treat ' em solemn . " " Why , I ai n't redikalis  --  we 're at work on science . I 'm pretty well scienced myself , and I want to get more so . " " Instead of talking , you 'd better paddle up street like a white-head . Go home to sleep like your crony  --  see how he shins it . " " I will , " said Grigsby , who likes a joke occasionally , and is very good humoured when it is not safe to be otherwise  --  " I will , if you 'll tell me what 's the use . In the first place , home 's a fool to this  --  and as for sleeping , it 's neither useful nor ornamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy  --  I do n't want to chaw you right up , but I must if you stay . " " I snore when I 'm asleep  --  and when I do , Tom puts his foot out of bed till it 's cold , and then claps it to my back . He calls it firing me off on the cold pressure principle . " " What a cruel Tom ! But why do n't you keep your mouth shut ? You should never wear it open when you 're asleep . " " If I did , my dreams would get smothered . Besides , I like to look down my throat , to see what I 'm thinking about . " " Do n't quiz me , young man . Some things is easy to put up with , and some things is n't easy to put up with ; and quizzing a dignittery is one of the last . If there is any thing I stands upon , it 's dignitty . " " Dignitty made of pipe-stems , is n't it ? " " My legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some what 's made coarser and cheaper ; but they 're slim and genteel . But legs are neither here nor there . You must go home , sonny , or go with me . " " Well , as I 'm rather select in my associations , and never did admire sleeping thicker than six in a bed at the outside , I 'll go home , put a woollen stocking on Tom 's foot , and take a pint of sleep : I never try more , for my constitution wo n't stand it . But to-morrow I 'll swing by my toes , I promise you . " " Go , then . Less palaver and more tortle . " " Tortelons nous  --  good night ; I 'm off to my lit . " The censor morum wrapping himself in his consequence , paused , looked grave until Grigsby turned the corner , and then , relaxing his dignitty , laughed creakingly , like a rusty door . " Hee ! hee ! hee !  --  that 's a real fine feller . He 's too good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night  --  always funny or fighting , and never pays his debts . Hee ! hee ! hee ! a real gentleman  --  gives me half a dollar a New Year 's  --  a real  --  past two o'clock and a cloudy morning !  --  sort of a gentleman , and encourages our business like an emperor , only I have n't got the heart to take advantage of it . " Jacob Grigsby moved homeward , his temper souring as he proceeded and as the pleasant excitement of the evening began to wear off . Some people , by the way , are always good humoured abroad , and reserve their savage traits for home consumption . Of this class is Grigsby . Where he boards , the rule is to stow thick  --  three in a bed when the weather is warm , and , in the colder season , by way of saving blankets , four in a bed is the rule . Now , even three in a bed is by no means a pleasant arrangement at the best , when the parties are docile in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all facing the same way , and it is terrible if one of the triad be of an uneasy disposition . Grigsby 's " pardeners , " however , are quiet lads , and there is an understanding among the three that turn about shall be the law in regard to the middle place , which therefore falls to his share every third week  --  one week in , and two weeks out  --  the soft never to be monopolized by any one individual , and nobody to turn round more than once in the course of the night . Grigsby is borne down by the majority ; but when it is his week in , he is worse than the armed rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger , so ferocious are his ebullitions of wrath . It happened to be his week " in , " the thought whereof moved his ire , and he ascended the stairs with the energetic tread of an ox , set fire to the cat 's tail with the candle , and poked a long nine down Carlo 's throat . " Ha ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveyed his sleeping bedfellows , and flashed the light in their eyes  --  " mighty comfortable that , anyhow ; but I 'll soon spoil it , or I 'm not a true Grigsby . " He put out the light , and in full dress  --  boots , hat , great coat , body coat , and pantaloons  --  muddy as he was , scrambled over the bed two or three times , until he established himself in the central station between his co-mates . He rolled and he tossed , he kicked and he groaned , until the whole concern were as wide awake as himself . " Why , Jacob , you 've got your boots on , " said they . " The fact is , fellows , the cold in my head is getting worse , and sleeping in boots draws down the inflammation . It 's a certain cure . " " But you do n't intend sleeping with your hat on your head , do you ? " " Did n't I tell you I 've got holes in my stockings ? If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to have the rheuma tism in my big toe . " " Well , we wo n't stand it , no how it can be fixed . " " Just as you like  --  go somewhere else  --  I 've no ob jection . I 'm amazing comfortable . " " Why , thunder and fury ! " said one , jerking up his leg , " your boots are covered with mud . " " That are a fact  --  you 've no idea how muddy the streets are  --  I 'm all over mud  --  I wish you 'd blow up the corporation . But hang it , give us a fip 's worth of sheet and a ' levy 's worth of blanket . That 's the way I like ' em mixed  --  some lean and a good deal of fat . " So saying , Jacob wound himself up in the bed-clothes with a prodigious flounder , denuding his companions entirely . Grigsby 's co-mates however , knowing that " who would be free , themselves must strike the blow , " declared war against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gymnastic powers , succeeded in obtaining the mastery . Much enraged , they resolved upon carrying him down stairs and placing him under the hydrant as a punishment for his violations of the social compact , and were proceeding to put their determination in force , when Bobolink and the rest of the boarders , alarmed at the noise , popped out of their chambers . " What 's the fraction  --  vulgar or decimal ? " said Bobolink . " Vengeance ! " panted Grigsby  --  " revenge ! I 'm insulted  --  let me go ! " The cause of quarrel was explained  --  all cried shame upon Mr. Jacob Grigsby , and Mr. Bobolink constituted himself judge on the occasion . " They kicked me ! " roared the prisoner . " Yes , " replied Bobolink , " but as they had n't their boots on , it was n't downright Mayor 's court assault and battery  --  only an insult with intent to hurt  --  assault and battery in the second degree  --  a species of accidental homicide . Perhaps you were going down stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it swift , and ' most walked into you . What was it for ? " " Look ye , " said Grigsby  --  " it 's very late  --  yes , it 's nearly morning , and I did n't take time to fix myself for a regular sleep , so I turned in like a trooper 's horse , and that 's the whole matter . " " Like a trooper 's horse  --  how 's that ? " " I 'll explain , " said one of the spectators  --  " to turn in like a trooper 's horse is to go to bed all standing , ready for a sudden call  --  parade order  --  winter uniform  --  full dress  --  a very good fashion when you 've been out to supper  --  convenient in case of fire , and saves a deal of trouble in the morning when you 're late for breakfast . " " Well , I never heard tell of the likes on the part of a white man . They served you right , and my judgment is , as you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-cellar till breakfast time . I 'm not going to have any more row . If you do n't like it , you can appeal afterwards . " " Never heerd the likes ! " said Jacob contemptuously ; " ai n't a bed a bed  --  ai n't my share of it , my share of it ?  --  and where 's the law that lays down what sort of clothes a man must sleep in ? I 'll wear a porcupine jacket , and sleep in it too , if I like  --  yes , spurs , and a trumpet , and a spanner . " " Put him in the cellar , " was the reply , and in spite of his struggles the sentence was laughingly enforced . " Bobolink , let 's out , or I 'll burst the door  --  let 's out  --  I want vengeance ! " " Keep yourself easy  --  you ca n't have any vengeance till morning . Perhaps they 'll wrap some in a bit of paper , and keep it for you . " But in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The illustrious Pangloss , who taught the **37;1148;TOOLONG at the Westphalian chateau of the puissant Baron Thundertentronckh , held it as a cardinal maxim of his philosophy , que tout est au mieux ; that " it 's all for the best . " Pangloss was therefore what is called an optimist , and discontent  --  to use the favourite word of the slang-whangers  --  was repudiated by him and his followers . This doctrine , however , though cherished in the abstract , is but little practised out of the domain of Thundertentronckh . The world is much more addicted to its opposite . " All 's for the worst " is a very common motto , and under its influence there are thousands who growl when they go to bed , and growl still louder when they get up ; they growl at their breakfast , they growl at their dinner , they growl at their supper , and they growl between meals . Discontent is written in every feature of their visage ; and they go on from the beginning of life until its close , always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaring them into it with ugly noises . These be your passive grumbletonians . When the castle was on fire , Sir Abel Handy stood wringing his hands , in expectation that the fire would be civil enough to go out of itself . So is it with the passive . He would utter divers maledictions upon the heat , but would sit still to see if the flame could not be scolded into going out of itself . The active grumbletonians , however , though equally opposed in practice to the **37;1187;TOOLONG , are a very different race of mortals from the passives . The world is largely indebted to them for every comfort and convenience with which it abounds ; and they laugh at the inquiry whether their exertions have conduced to the general happiness , holding it that happiness consists chiefly in exertion  --  to which the passives demur , as they look back with no little regret to the lazy days of pastoral life , when Chaldean shepherds lounged upon the grass . The actives are very much inclined to believe that whatever is , is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable conviction that they are able to set it right  --  an opinion which fire can not melt out of them . These restless fellows are in a vast majority ; and hence it is that the surface of this earthly sphere is such a scene of activity ; hence it is that for so many thousand years , the greater part of each generation has been unceasingly employed in labour and bustle ; rushing from place to place ; hammering , sawing , and driving ; hewing down and piling up mountains ; and unappalled , meeting disease and death , both by sea and land . To expedite the process of putting things to rights , likewise , hence it is that whole hecatombs of men have been slaughtered on the embattled field , and that the cord , the fagot , and the steel have been in such frequent demand . Sections of the active grumbletonians sometimes differ about the means of making the world a more comfortable place , and time being short , the labour-saving process is adopted . The weaker party is knocked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and answers pretty nearly the same end . But yet , though the world is many years old , and the " fixing process " has been going on ever since it emerged from chaos , it seems that much remains undone , with less time to do it in . The actives consequently redouble their activity . They have called in the aid of gunpowder and steam , and in this goodly nineteenth century are kicking up such a terrible dust , and are setting things to rights at such a rate , that the passives have no comfort of their lives . Where they herd in nations , as in Mexico , the actives cluster on their borders and set things to rights with the rifle ; and when they are solitary amid the crowd , as among us , they are fretted to fiddlestrings , like plodding shaft horses with unruly leaders . They are environed with perils . In one quarter , hundreds of stately mansions are brought thundering to the ground , because the last generation put things to rights in the wrong way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true principle . Between them both , the passive is kept in a constant state of solicitude , and threads his way through piles of rubbish , wearing his head askew like a listening chicken , looking above with one eye , to watch what may fall on him , and looking below with the other , to see what he may fall upon . Should he travel , he is placed in a patent exploding steamboat , warranted to boil a gentleman cold in less than no time ; or he is tied to the tail of a big steam kettle , termed a locomotive , which goes sixty miles an hour horizontally , or if it should meet impediment , a mile in half a second perpendicularly . Should he die , as many do , of fixo-phobia , and seek peace under the sod , the spirit of the age soon grasps the spade and has him out to make way for improvement . The passive grumbletonian is useless to himself and to others : the active grumbletonian is just the reverse . In general , he combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in that class  --  men , who try to take so much care of the world that they forget themselves , and , of course , fail in their intent . Such a man is Fydget Fyxington , an **65;1226;TOOLONG hilo sopher . Fydget 's abstract principle , particularly in matters of government and of morals , is doubtless a sound rule ; but he looks so much at the beginning that he rarely arrives at the end , and when he advances at all , he marches backward , his face being directed toward the starting place instead of the goal . By this means he may perhaps plough a straight furrow , but instead of curving round obstructions , he is very apt to be thrown down by them . Like most philosophers who entertain a creed opposed to that of the illustrious Pangloss , Fydget may be fitly designated as the fleshless one . He never knew the joy of being fat , and is one of those who may console themselves with the belief that the physical sharpness which renders them a walking chevaux de frise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but an outward emblem of the acuteness of the mind . Should he be thrust in a crowd against a sulky fellow better in flesh than himself , who complains of the pointedness of his attentions , Fydget may reflect that even so do his reasoning faculties bore into a subject . When gazing in a mirror , should his eye be offended by the view of lantern jaws , and channelled cheeks , and bones prematurely labouring to escape from their cuticular tabernacle , he may easily figure to himself the restless energy of his spirit , which like a keen blade , weareth away the scabbard  --  he may look upon himself as an intellectual " cut and thrust "  --  a thinking chopper and stabber . But it may be doubted whether Fydget ever reverts to considerations so purely selfish , except when he finds that the " fine points " of his figure are decidedly injurious to wearing apparel and tear his clothes . Winter ruled the hour when Fydget Fyxington was last observed to be in circulation  --  winter , when men wear their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season however , which , though sharp and biting in its temper , has redeeming traits . There is something peculiarly exhilarating in the sight of new-fallen snow . The storm which brings it is not without a charm . The graceful eddying of the drifts sported with by the wind , and the silent gliding of the feathery flakes , as one by one they settle upon the earth like fairy creatures dropping to repose , have a soothing influence not easily described , though doubtless felt by all . But when the clouds , having performed their office , roll away , and the brightness of the morning sun beams upon an expanse of sparkling , unsullied whiteness ; when all that is common-place , coarse , and unpleasant in aspect , is veiled for the time , and made to wear a fresh and dazzling garb , new animation is felt by the spirit . The young grow riotous with joy , and their merry voices ring like bells through the clear and bracing air ; while the remembrance of earlier days gives a youthful impulse to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad reverse . The resolution of these enchantments into their original elements by means of a thaw , is a necessary , but , it must be confessed , a very doleful process , fruitful in gloom , rheum , inflammations , and fevers  --  a process which gives additional pangs to the melancholic , and causes valour 's self to droop like unstarched muslin . The voices of the boys are hushed ; the whizzing snow-ball astonishes the unsuspicious wayfarer no more ; the window glass is permitted to live its brief day , safe from an untimely fracture , and the dejected urchin sneaks moodily from school . So changed is his nature , that he scarcely bestows a derisive grin upon the forlorn sleigh , which ploughs its course through mud and water , although its driver and his passengers invite the jeer by making themselves small to avoid it , and tempt a joke by oblique glances to see whether it is coming . Such a time was it when Fydget was extant  --  a sloppy time in January . The city , it is true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rusty and forlorn in aspect , and weeping , as if in sorrow that its original purity had become soiled , stained , and spotted by contact with the world . Its whiteness had in a measure disappeared , by the pressure of human footsteps ; wheels and runners had almost incorporated it with the common earth ; and , where these had failed in effectually doing the work , remorseless distributers of ashes , coal dust , and potato peelings , had lent their aid to give uniformity to the dingy hue . But the snow , " weeping its spirit from its eyes , " and its body too , was fast escaping from these multiplied oppressions and contumelies . Large and heavy drops splashed from the eaves ; sluggish streams rolled lazily from the alleys , and the gutters and crossings formed vast shallow lakes , variegated by glaciers and ice islands . They who roamed abroad at this unpropitious time , could be heard approaching by the damp sucking sound which emanated from their boots , as they alternately pumped in and pumped out the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero travelled , having no caoutchouc health-preservers to shield his pedals from unwholesome contact . The shades of evening were beginning to thicken , when Fydget stopped shiveringly and looked through the glass door of a fashionable hotel  --  the blazing fire and the numerous lights , by the force of contrast , made an outside seat still more uncomfortable . The gong pealed out that tea was ready , and the lodgers rushed from the stoves to comfort themselves with that exhilarating fluid . " There they go on first principles , " said Fydget Fyxington with a sigh . " Cla ' de kitchen da ' , " said one of those ultra-aristocratic members of society , a negro waiter , as he bustled past the contemplative philosopher and entered the hotel  --  " you ought to be gwang home to suppa ' , ole soul , if you got some  --  yaugh  --  waugh ! " " Suppa ' , you nigga ' ! " contemptuously responded Fydget , as the door closed  --  " I wish I was gwang home to suppa ' , but suppers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I see . Every thing is wrong  --  such a wandering from first principles !  --  there must be enough in this world for us all , or we would n't be here ; but things is fixed so badly that I s'pose some greedy rascal gets my share of suppa ' and other such elegant luxuries . It 's just the way of the world ; there 's plenty of shares of every thing , but somehow or other there are folks that lay their fingers on two or three shares , and sometimes more , according as they get a chance , and the real owners , like me , may go whistle . They 've fixed it so that if you go back to first principles and try to bone what belongs to you , they pack you right off to jail , ' cause you ca n't prove property . Empty stummicks and old clothes ai n't good evidence in court . " What the deuse is to become of me ! Something must  --  and I wish it would be quick and hurra about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summerhouse order for the winter fashions . People will soon see too much of me  --  not that I care much about looks myself , but boys is boys , and all boys is sassy . Since the weather 's been chilly , when I turn the corner to go up town , I feel as if the house had too many windows and doors , and I 'm almost blow 'd out of my coat and pants . The fact is , I do n't get enough to eat to serve for ballast . " After a melancholy pause , Fydget , seeing the coast tolerably clear , walked in to warm himself at the fire in the bar-room , near which he stood with great composure , at the same time emptying several glasses of comfortable compounds which had been left partly filled by the lodgers when they hurried to their tea . Lighting a cigar which he found half smoked upon the ledge of the stove , he seated himself and puffed away much at his ease . The inmates of the hotel began to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drawing their chairs away from him as they sat down near the stove . Fydget looked unconscious , emitting volumes of smoke , and knocking off the ashes with a nonchalant and scientific air . " Bad weather , " said Brown " I 've noticed that the weather is frequently bad in winter , especially about the middle of it , and at both ends , " added Green . " I keep a memorandum book on the subject , and ca n't be mistaken . " " It 's raining now , " said Griffinhoff  --  " what 's the use of that when it 's so wet under foot already ? " " It very frequently rains at the close of a thaw , and it 's beneficial to the umbrella makers , " responded Green . " Nothin 's fixed no how , " said Fydget with great energy , for he was tired of listening . Brown , Green , Griffinhoff , and the rest started and stared . " Nothin 's fixed no how , " continued Fydget rejoicing in the fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascals . Why did n't they roof over the side walks , and not leave every thing for us to do ? I ai n't got no numbrell , and besides that , when it comes down as if raining was no name for it , as it always does when I 'm cotch 'd out , numbrells is no great shakes if you 've got one with you , and no shakes at all if it 's at home . " " Who 's the indevidjual ? " inquired Cameo Calliper , Esq. , looking at Fydget through a pair of lorgnettes . Fydget returned the glance by making an opera glass with each fist , and then continued his remarks : " It 's a pity we ai n't got feathers , so 's to grow our own jacket and trousers , and do up the tailorin ' business , and make our own feather beds . It would be a great savin '  --  every man his own clothes , and every man his own feather bed . Now I 've got a suggestion about that  --  first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the matter 's done . How would it do to bile a big kittle full of tar , tallow , beeswax and injen rubber , with considerable wool , and dab the whole family once a week ? The young ' uns might be soused in it every Saturday night , and the nigger might fix the elderly folks with a whitewash brush . Then there would n't be no bother a washing your clothes or yourself , which last is an invention of the doctor to make people sick , because it lets in the cold in winter and the heat in summer , when natur ' says shut up the porouses and keep ' em out . Besides , when the new invention was tore at the knees or wore at the elbows , just tell the nigger to put on the kittle and give you a dab , and you 're patched slick  --  and so that whole mobs of people might n't stick together like figs , a little sperrits of turpentine or litharage might be added to make ' em dry like a house-a-fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll hurt him , " said Griffinhoff sotto voce . " Where 's a waiter ? " inquired Cameo Calliper edging off in alarm . " He 's crazy , " said Green  --  " I was at the hospital once , and there was a man in the place who  --  " " ' T would be nice for sojers , " added Fyxington , as he threw away his stump , and very deliberately reached over and helped himself to a fresh cigar , from a number which Mr. Green had just brought from the bar and held in his hand  --  " I 'll trouble you for a little of your fire , " continued he , taking the cigar from the mouth of Mr. Green , and after obtaining a light , again placing the borrowed Habana within the lips of that worthy individual , who sat stupified at the audacity of the supposed maniac . Fydget gave the conventional grin of thanks peculiar to such occasions , and with a graceful wave of his hand , resumed the thread of his lecture ,  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em all of a row , and whitewash ' em blue or red , according to pattern , as if they were a fence . The gin'rals might look on to see if it was done according to Gunter ; the cap'ins might flourish the brush , and the corpulars carry the bucket . Dandies could fix themselves all sorts of streaked and all sorts of colours . When the parterials is cheap and the making do n't cost nothing , that 's what I call economy , and coming as near as possible to first principles . It 's a better way , too , of keeping out the rain , than my t' other plan of flogging people when they 're young , to make their hides hard and waterproof . A good licking is a sound first principle for juveniles , but they 've got a prejudice agin it . " " Waiter ! " cried Cameo Calliper . " Sa ! " " Remove the incumbent  --  expose him to the atmosphere ! " " If you had n't said that , I 'd wopped him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've as good a right to be here as any body , " remarked Fydget indignantly . " Cut you ' stick , ' cumbent  --  take you'sef off , trash ! " said the waiter , keeping at a respectful distance . " Do n't come near me , Sip , " growled Fydget , doubling his fist  --  " do n't come near me , or I 'll develope a first principle and ' lucidate a simple idea for you  --  I 'll give you a touch of natur ' without no gloves on  --  but I 'll not stay , though I 've a clear right to do it , unless you are able  --  yes , sassy able !  --  to put me out . If there is any thing I scorns it 's prejudice , and this room 's so full of it and smoke together that I wo n't stay . Your cigar , sir , " added Fydget , tossing the stump to Mr. Green and retiring slowly . " That fellow 's brazen enough to collect militia fines , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if pasted over with white paper and rigged athwart ships , he 'd make a pretty good sign for an oyster cellar . " The rest of the company laughed nervously , as if not perfectly sure that Fydget was out of hearing . " The world 's full of it  --  nothin ' but prejudice . I 'm always served the same way , and though I 've so much to do planning the world 's good , I ca n't attend to my own business , it not only wo n't support me , but it treats me with despise and unbecoming freedery . Now , I was used sinful about my universal language , which every body can understand , which makes no noise , and which do n't convolve no wear and tear of the tongue . It 's the patent **29;1293;TOOLONG omnibus linguister , to be done by winking and blinking , and cocking your eye , the way the cat-fishes make Fourth of July orations . I was going to have it introduced in Congress , to save the expense of anchovies and more porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller in the street ; I danced right up to him , and began canoeuvering my daylights to ask him what o'clock it was , and I 'm blow 'd if he did n't swear I was crazy , up fist and stop debate , by putting it to me right atween the eyes , so that I 've been pretty well bung 'd up about the peepers ever since , by a feller too who could n't understand a simple idea . That was worse than the kick a feller gave me in market , because ' cording to first principles I put a bullowney sassinger into my pocket , and did n't pay for it . The ' riginal law , which you may see in children , says when you ai n't got no money , the next best thing is to grab and run . I did grab and run , but he grabb 'd me , and I had to trot back agin , which always hurts my feelin 's and stops the march of mind . He would n't hear me ' lucidate the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lent me the loan of his foot , was werry sewere . It was unsatisfactory and discombobberative , and made me wish I could find out the hurtin ' principle and have it ' radicated . " Carriages were driving up to the door of a house brilliantly illuminated , in one of the fashionable streets , and the music which pealed from within intimated that the merry dance was on foot . " I 'm goin ' in , " said Fydget  --  " I 'm not afeard  --  if we go on first principles we ai n't afeard of nothin ' , and since they 've monopolized my sheer of fun , they ca n't do less than give me a shinplaster to go away . My jacket 's so wet with the rain , if I do n't get dry I 'll be sewed up and have hic jacket wrote atop of me , which means defuncted of toggery not imprevious to water . In I go . ' In accordance with this design , he watched his opportunity and slipped quietly into the gay mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked in upon the dancers . " Who-o-ip ! " shouted Fydget Fyxington , forgetting himself in the excitement of the scene  --  " Who-o-ip ! " added he , as he danced forward with prodigious vigour and activity , flourishing the eatables with which his hands were crammed , as if they were a pair of cymbals  --  " Whurro-o-o ! plank it down  --  that 's your sort !  --  make yourselves merry , gals and boys  --  it 's all accordin ' to first principles  --  whoo-o-o-ya  --  whoop !  --  it takes us ! " Direful was the screaming at this formidable apparition  --  the fiddles ceased  --  the waltzers dropped their panting burdens , and the black band looked pale and aghast . " Who-o-o-p ! go ahead !  --  come it strong ! " continued Fydget . But he was again doomed to suffer an ejectment . " Hustle him out ! " " Give us a shinplaster ' then  --  them 's my terms . " It would not do  --  he was compelled to retire shinplasterless ; but it rained so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley-way , re-entered the house through the garden , and gliding noiselessly into the cellar , turned a large barrel over which he found there , and getting into it , went fast asleep " on first principles . " The company had departed  --  the servants were assembled in the kitchen preparatory to retiring for the night , when an unearthly noise proceeding from the barrel aforesaid struck upon their astonished ears . It was Fydget snoring , and his hearers , screaming , fled . Rallying , however , at the top of the stairs , they procured the aid of Mr. Lynx , who watched over the nocturnal destinies of an unfinished building in the vicinity , and who , having frequently boasted of his valour , felt it to be a point of honour to act bravely on this occasion . The sounds continued , and the " investigating committee , " with Mr. Lynx as chairman , advanced slowly and with many pauses . Lynx at last hurriedly thrust his club into the barrel , and started back to wait the result of the experiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the word being one not to be found in the dictionaries , but which , in common parlance , means that a sensation too acute to be agreeable has been excited . " Hey !  --  hello !  --  come out of that , " said Lynx , as soon as his nerves had recovered tranquillity . " You are in a bad box whoeve you are . " " Augh ! " was the response , " no , I ai n't  --  I 'm in a barrel . " " No matter , " added Lynx authoritatively ; " getting into another man 's barrel unbeknownst to him in the night-time , is burglary . " " That , " said Fydget , putting out his head like a terrapin , at which the women shrieked and retreated , and Lynx made a demonstration with his club  --  " that 's because you ai n't up to first principles  --  keep your stick out of my ribs  --  I 've a plan so there wo n't be no burglary , which is this  --  no man have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind their own business . Then , this ' ere barrel would be mine while I 'm in it , and you 'd be asleep  --  that 's the idea . " " It 's a logo-fogie ! " exclaimed Lynx with horror  --  " a right down logo-fogie ! " " Ah ! " screamed the servants  --  " a logo-fogie !  --  how did it get out ?  --  will it bite ?  --  ca n't you get a gun ? " " Do n't be fools  --  a logo-fogie is a sort of a man that do n't think as I do  --  wicked critters all such sort of people are , " said Lynx . " My lad , I 'm pretty clear you 're a logo-fogie  --  you talk as if your respect for me and other venerable institutions was tantamount to very little . You 're a leveller I see , and would n't mind knocking me down flat as a pancake , if so be you could run away and get out of this scrape  --  you 're a ' grarium , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had a chance . " " Mr. Lynx , " said the lady of the house from the head of the stairs ,  --  she had heard from one of the affrighted maids that a " logo-fogie " had been " captivated , " and that it could talk " just like a human "  --  " Mr. Lynx , do n't have any thing to say to him . Take him out , and hand him over to the police . I 'll see that you are recompensed for your trouble . " " Come out , then  --  you 're a bad chap  --  you would n't mind voting against our side at the next election . " " We do n't want elections , I tell you , " said Fydget coolly , as he walked up stairs  --  " I 've a plan for doing without elections , and police-officers , and laws  --  every man mind his own business , and support me while I oversee him . I can fix it . " Having now arrived at the street , Mr. Lynx held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of justice to relieve him of his prize . " Though I feel as if I was your pa , yet you must be tried for snoozling in a barrel . Besides , you 've no respect for functionaries , and you sort of want to cut a piece out of the common veal by your logo-fogieism in wishing to ' bolish laws , and policers , and watchmen , when my brother 's one , and helps to govern the nation when the President , the Mayor , and the rest of the day-watch has turned in , or are at a tea-party . You 'll get into prison . " " We do n't want prisons . " " Yes we do though  --  what 's to become of functionaries if there ai n't any prisons ? " This was rather a puzzling question . Fyxington paused , and finally said : " Why , I 've a plan . " " What is it , then  --  is it logo-fogie ? " " Yes , it upsets existing institutions , " roared Fyxington , tripping up Mr. Lynx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plans that ever answered the purpose . THE END . Back matter
