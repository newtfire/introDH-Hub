Last week the New York Times printed the following dramatic despatch from Washington , Pa. : " Totally blind since she was less than a year old , 13-year-old Mary Grabowsky , second daughter of Walter Grabowsky , a poor miner of Coal Center , this county , walked out of the Washington Hospital today , scarcely able to conceal her delight and asking officers of the Red Cross to hurry her home that she might see her mother for the first time . <P> " Mary was to have been sent to the Western Pennsylvania School for the Blind . A rare operation , performed a few days ago on her right eye by Dr. J. B. McMurray of the Washington Hospital staff , technically known as an optical iridectomy , was today pronounced a success . . . . <P> " The girl contracted a skin disease when a baby , and later abscesses which formed on her eyes , presumably through inattention , rendered her sightless . <P> " Filled with pity , and remembering his Master 's art , a Catholic priest , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary to see . Great miracle among great miracles was again brought to pass , this time by mundane skill . " <P> For scientists this despatch lacked professional interest . Such an operation , although delicate and demanding high skill in the use of fine knives , had been done previously and with relative frequency . But rarely before had human interest been keyed to so lofty a pitch . <P> A Roman Catholic priest , remembering a great miracle among his Master 's great miracles , had led this blind child to the surgeon . He it was who had made this Mary to see .
