Mr. Jackson , who likes to say he is making history and not hysteria , spoke less in the future tense and slipped into the past tense when talking of his campaign today. // " I sought to bring the people together , " he told the Ohio Association of Broadcasters , in a day of rallies , receptions and speeches in Cincinnati as he courted votes for next Tuesday ' s Ohio Democratic Presidential primary. // " Others started with money , " he said . " I started with a rich message . It was a poor campaign with a rich message . That message was very basic. " // If losing the New York primary last week made Mr. Jackson realize that the nomination was probably out of his reach , losing the Pennsylvania primary Tuesday jarred his advisers into a more modest exploration of options. // Speaking of what Mr. Jackson expected from party leaders , his campaign manager , Gerald Austin , said : " You get treated like a viable candidate for President . That ' s what they ' ve been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . You come to the convention in Atlanta , and you don ' t stay in Motel 6 . " <> <> Building Party Base // Certainly , Mr. Jackson did not give up the rhetoric of victory , and he told audiences today , " Our campaign is alive. " // But while Mr. Austin noted that " we ' re not out of this until that final bell sounds , " the aide talked about the campaign less in terms of winning the nomination than in terms of Mr. Jackson ' s contribution to broadening the party ' s base and warming up its message. // " He may not win the most delegates or popular vote , " Mr. Austin said , " but Jesse Jackson is still the big winner of 1988 because of the way he has brought people into the party. " // Speaking of the new voters that the Chicago civil rights leader has attracted , Mr. Austin said , " It ' s all about Democrats winning the White House , and he ' s a vital cog in that wheel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and Pennsylvania. " // " Republicans win by our people staying home , " Mr. Austin added . " Even if Jesse Jackson does nothing else this year - and he ' s done a lot of things this year - he ' s involved people in the process. " // The delegates that Mr. Jackson has won " will go to the convention and make a mark on the convention , one way or another , " Mr. Austin said . " It ' s not a negative thing of making demands . It ' s a very positive thing of being involved . " <> <> Challenge for Candidate // Mr. Austin said that Mr. Jackson ' s greatest challenge in the remainder of his Presidential campaign will be to rechannel the hopes that his candidacy have aroused . " Sometimes the biggest challenge is to keep people involved once they know that the standard bearer that they want to be nominated is not going to be the nominee , " he said. // Meeting that challenge will take " Jesse Jackson ' s involvement in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin said. // Asked what form that involvement would take , Mr. Austin replied that , whatever else the candidate gets , Mr. Jackson could again play the role of " one of those top surrogates , " as he did in the 1984 general election. // " When you talk to state chairman around the country , especially in the South , they ' ll tell you they wanted Jesse Jackson in their state before they wanted Mondale and Ferraro , " Mr. Austin said , referring to the Democratic ticket of Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro , " because they knew when he came into the state , he would be involved with people at local levels who are going to vote for assemblymen , state representatives and county courthouse people. " // Mr. Austin said that Mr. Jackson and Gov . Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts , who has emerged as the probable Democratic nominee , would have to get together before the party ' s national convention this summer to answer the key question of the 1988 race : " What does Jesse want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party leaders would give Mr. Jackson. short shrift . " We ' re not dealing with a bunch of idiots , " Mr. Austin said . " They know that this is a 46-year-old man who will be a force in the party for years to come - this time , next time and 20 years from now . He ' s not just a leader of black people . He ' s a leader. " // Mr. Austin said that Mr. Jackson had not yet talked to party leaders about his future role , " but I think those are discussions that will take place. " // He said he " could not imagine " that the convention would approve a platform in which Mr. Jackson ' s influence was not apparent. ointing out that the other candidates - Republican as well as Democratic - have adopted some of Mr. Jackson ' s main issues , Mr. Austin said , " So how are we going to go to a convention and come out to a platform different than Jesse Jackson ' s issues ? " <> <> Vice Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a running mate because he might feel that Mr. Jackson would overshadow him , Mr. Austin was ready with one of his trademark , martini-dry answers . " People could say that about anybody Michael Dukakis picked , " he said . " Does that mean that it would be a preprequisite that his running mate be shorter ? And if Jesse Jackson is nominated , does he need to pick someone dull ? " // But the campaign is not ruling out the possibility of Mr. Jackson ' s being the Vice Presidential nominee. // Asked if Mr. Jackson would insist on approving any nominee for Vice President , Mr. Austin said : " I don ' t think anybody ' s ever said that . " The campaign manager said he did not think that Mr. Jackson would object to Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia on the basis of his civil rights record . Mr. Nunn has been mentioned several times as a possible Vice Presidential choice. // " When Lyndon Johnson became Vice President , he did not have a sterling civil rights record at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Administration , that was the high point . I wouldn ' t write a guy off based upon what the past is. " // Mr. Jackson dismissed abruptly the charge by the chairman of his Pennsylvania campaign , City Councilman Lucien Blackwell , that he had spent too much time in western Pennsylvania and not enough in Philadelphia. // " It ' s not true , " Mr. Jackson said . " We won Philadelphia . That ' s the end of that. " // Although the candidate had sounded elegiac early in the day , by evening Mr. Jackson was determined to put on a bold public face. // " Let there be no doubt in your mind , " he told about 2 , 800 people at a " get out the vote " rally at the Union Terminal , the city ' s closed Art Deco railway station . " We only have one gear . It ' s called forward all the way to California and New Jersey , all the way to Atlanta , all the way to the White House . We ain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
