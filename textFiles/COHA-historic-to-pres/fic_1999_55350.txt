Let me ask you , have you ever , you know , faked an orgasm with me ? " Frank asks Lise . They 're in a crowded restaurant just off Madison . Lise looks up from her softshell crabs to see if the diners at the nearby tables are staring . This question is unlike Frank ; it 's direct and uncharming . " Well , when we were first together , maybe , " she says . <p> Frank , in cool seersucker , asks , " Do you mean the first time , well ... since ? " meaning the first time since his marriage . <p> " No , no , when we were in our twenties . " <p> " Oh , well , that was nearly twenty years ago . " He looks at the ceiling , calculating . " Nineteen , in fact . " Frank is dismissive of the lovely eager boy who had taken her in a flurry , still in her cotton nightgown with the eyelets . " But not now ? " <p> " No , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no other answer , regardless of the truth . <p> Less than a week later , Frank comes to town unexpectedly . Unable to get him a reservation at his regular hotel , his new secretary has booked him into a horrible one on Third Avenue . After a long dinner , he and Lise are too tired and too excited to change hotels . Once they 're in the room , Frank sees a pubic hair on the pillow . " Like a mint , " Lise says , and they laugh , gag , and strip the pillowcase . Then , just as they 've stripped off their clothes as well , his wife calls , and Lise lies still on the bed . <p> " What did the mechanic say ? " ( As if you knew a thing about cars , Lise thinks . ) " Well , when ? ... Um , um . Did Victor call ? Good . Wait , hold on a minute , I got ta get a pen . " He makes a writing gesture , and Lise gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to scramble , naked , stretching the phone cord . She is furious about this Victor fellow who has suddenly appeared in the room with them , this man from Frank 's other life . She turns on the shower . <p> On Wednesday Lise goes to the Frick Reference Library . She 's been researching the work of a little-known American Impressionist for a client who owns several of his later paintings . It 's nice work ; the more Lise learns about the man , the more she sees in his art . Under the coffered ceiling , with her elbows on the burgundy felt mats that protect the books and absorb sound , she looks at lush reproductions of paintings by John Singer Sargent , a contemporary of the artist she 's investigating . She focuses on the dexterity of Sargent 's talent : four wild brush strokes in four distinct colors perfectly depict a sleeve of weightless organza around the pink flesh of Mrs. Henry White 's arm . She reads about his frustration with his own facile skill , his sense that it 's robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next time Frank 's in town , there is no mistake , and they go to the nice hotel , their usual hotel , where they always get a suite . Lise 's skirt is rucked up to her waist , and the sweat courses down Frank 's long nose , his seersucker pants an accordion at his ankles ; after all these years they still ca n't wait . <p> Later , when they 're in bed , showered and cozy , they settle down to talk . They entertain one another , they do n't talk about plumbers . Lise tells Frank a story about the third wife of the Sultan of Brunei . <p> " No one has ever seen her . She does n't go out , ever ; no one 's allowed to ' gaze upon her . ' Anyway , this wife , when she comes to Paris to shop , she takes over an entire floor at the Plaza Athenee . " <p> " This is what Favored Nation is for ? " Frank says , sitting up to get a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the fashion houses send over dozens of complete outfits  --  ones she picked out from books of photos and from videos ; they 're all numbered . She looks over everything , the dresses themselves , then all the hats , gloves , scarves , jewelry , shoes ... " <p> " Does she take everything , the Sultan 's third wife ? " Frank asks . He turns his back on Lise when he leans over to put the glass back . Absently , she starts tracing circles on his skin with her fingernail . He does n't move while she 's talking . <p> " Mostly . The rejects are returned to the couturiers . Then a bill is sent and paid for . No fittings , just tons of clothes . Literally tons . " <p> " But no one sees this woman ? " Frank says softly , his eyes closed , as Lise scratches patterns along his shoulder and up his neck . <p> " Except him ! That 's the thing . He 's the only one who gets to see these unbelievable clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor . " <p> Lise dreams : She is in a house so close to the ocean , the waves rise to their highest point right outside the windows  --  tall , wide , Victorian windows , heavy moldings . The spray comes in sometimes , and it only makes her laugh . A wall of blue-green water rises and rises above the house , and she is not afraid . A storm breaks , and lightning strikes the sea and strikes the house . She laughs to feel the electric charge as it plays between the plaster ceiling and the parquet floor . Lise wakes up , and someone is lying there , his back a freckled wall , and suddenly she realizes : It 's Frank . So rarely is he there to catch her dreams . <p> Each July , Frank would go away to his big summer house on Cape Cod , where he entertained friends and had begun teaching his small children about boats . To Lise , the picture of Frank 's life held little appeal . Frank has become middle-class  --  Frank with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the capital gains tax , debating the location of the best bone fishing in Belize , taking orders from his wife . As far as she knows , she 's his only perversion , Lise  --  in hotel rooms , where she throws her garter belt over a chair and laughs until her ribs hurt . <p> Once , at a party , a man who knew Frank but was innocent of his secret liaison with Lise referred to him as " henpecked . " At the time this remark embarrassed Lise , on Frank 's behalf and on her own as his lover . Sometimes , when she ca n't help thinking about his life without her , she is reminded of the phrase . She imagines tiny spots of blood in clusters on his skin where a sharp beak has broken through . Peck peck peck . Quick holes . Then scabs . <p> When they were young , Lise had had idiot dreams of her future with Frank . She 'd imagined herself in Europe with him , in a villa above Florence , a house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would do charcoal studies of Michelangelo 's slaves , he would read Dante aloud to her in the original . Their friends would compose plays on the spot , and they 'd all sing around a grand piano . And there 'd be happy children speaking many languages . Children with her long legs , his strong jaw , and their blue eyes . <p> After they 'd begun sleeping together  --  nicely , but without a lot of flourish  --  she had often thought of their children . Once , she 'd asked him , " What would you do if you had a stupid child ? " They were both silent for some time . <p> " Love it , " Frank said finally . Lise was young enough then to be proud of him for this lie . <p> In early September , Frank returns from his summer on the Cape . In their hotel , he reads aloud to Lise from an English magazine dedicated , it says , to " strange phenomena , curiosities , prodigies , and portents . " Lise can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while , and Lise giggles with him . In truth , she 's fascinated but unsettled . <p> One article is about a man who was tried on five counts of outraging public decency in Hereford . He had been found face-down on the sidewalk with his pants around his ankles . Children watched him humping up and down . They watched him attempt to mount an underpass . Then there was the man in a bulletproof vest who shot himself in order to achieve orgasm . And the man who swallowed Barbie doll heads at the moment of release . <p> After he finishes reading aloud , Frank says , " These are true stories . " <p> " I believe it . Now . There was a time I would n't have . A long time ago , though , " Lise says in a quiet voice , curving herself into a spoon around Frank . <p> " Did you bring your Barbie heads ? " he says , turning to face her , the sheets twisting under him . <p> " I 'm afraid I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit his . <p> After he smiles and throws the magazine down , Frank grabs her rear , pulls at her satin panties . The thigh-high stockings do their dirty work . That edge of him inside her , the dark beauty of this act , successful , in part , because it is dirty  --  this has the power to break her down , to accept him blindly and on his terms . She is fearful and excited by the shift within her , the friendly silliness that switches in a moment to this dark meeting . <p> More than a month later in the hotel , after Frank has n't bothered to make even a feeble excuse for this longish absence , Lise asks him , " Why did n't you marry me ? " <p> " You were living with Jim then , " Frank says , covering his body with the sheet . <p> " Before that . Before Jim . Before you got married . " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " You do n't know , " Lise says , flatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Too young , I guess . " There 's an edge in his voice . <p> That 's as far as she dares to take it . The question of her life . Years before , a friend had said to her , " Frank told me that the biggest mistake he ever made was not marrying you . " Now Lise wishes she 'd never heard those words . She has allowed them to break her down with possibility . <p> Later , after they 've made love again and she 's cuddled up under the sheet to warm her cooling body , Frank says , " Remember when we had that fight ? " <p> " When I socked you ? " Lise says , remembering their one and only bad quarrel . Charmed by their past , they 'd run through this memory before , up to a point . <p> " It hurt ! " <p> " Well , the evidence , those earrings under your coffee table  --  it was your little apartment on 10th Street , just before you moved ? You deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit you ... " <p> " We just burst out laughing ! " <p> " Well , it stopped the fight , all right . And we were so relieved to be friends again , " Lise says . " See , you were cheating even then . " <p> " But we were n't sleeping together yet ! " <p> " Oh yes , that 's when our love was pure . " Lise laces her fingers under her chin , tips her head , and flutters her eyelashes at Frank . <p> " God , that was weird , considering everyone was screwing around like mad  --  it was even before herpes . " Frank is looking straight ahead and has n't seen her innocent act , so she puts her hands down . " But were n't you sleeping with that guy ... what was his name ? " <p> " Peter . Pete . " <p> " What a creep . " <p> " Not really . " <p> " So why did you hit me , anyway , if you were sleeping with someone , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , you know , about Pete . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So , our love was pure . " <p> " I 'd say it was a case of reverse double standard , " Frank says . <p> " Yeah , well , that 's the name of the game with us , " Lise says . She adjusts her body away from Frank . " I never would have married you , anyway . You 'd have been unfaithful to me . " <p> " You 'd have never known . I 've learned not to leave earrings lying around , thanks to you , " he says , moving over to her and nuzzling her neck . <p> " I would , too , know . " <p> " She does n't . " <p> " She does n't want to . " <p> " We have nothing to do with her , " Frank says and stops nuzzling . <p> " Everyone in this stupid situation says that . But you 're wrong . We have everything to do with her . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Hoodwinked ? Is that what I did ? " Frank pulls the sheet over his head , then pulls it aside to expose one eye . <p> " Shut up , this is serious . " <p> " I do n't want to talk about it anymore , " Frank says , pulling the sheet off , sitting up straight , and plumping the pillows behind him . " If you do n't like the situation , you just say the word . " <p> Lise knows that Frank hates confrontations and messy emotions . That he could live without her is something she does n't want to test . <p> When Frank goes on a month-long sail to the Caribbean with some friends , Lise does n't expect a call . How could he call her ? Even if he found himself separated for a moment from his shipmates , the unfamiliar phone charges would be evidence . It 's not worth the risk . After all this time , it 's no big deal . <p> While Frank is away , Lise goes to Paris to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be away from New York . She has never been to Paris with him . She has been on a boat with him , watched him maneuver the craft through wind and water with a knowledge learned in childhood , squinting up to check the sails or the little flag that signals the wind 's direction . Where she was all knees and elbows , unaccustomed to the compressed space and sharp angles at odd heights , he was grace . His turned-out walk held him steady on the bow . Watching him , she 'd hit her head on the gangway door . <p> In Paris without him , she maneuvers through the streets like a Shield  --  a sleek , perfect racing boat . Cities are her element . She imagines Frank , confused in the Musee d'Orsay , turning the map around and around . He 'd like Courbet 's complicated allegory , Interior of My Studio , because the dog in the picture reminds him of Tibby , his long-dead spaniel . But then , she 's never gone with him to the Musee d'Orsay , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to the Met , or the Frick , or the Morgan Library . Never been to her favorite place in the park , Conservatory Waters , where the views have n't changed very much since William Merritt Chase painted them at the turn of the century . Frank does n't know William Merritt Chase . The trees are taller now . <p> Lise stays with friends on the rue Jacob . She goes out every night , she goes out every day . Into the streets , out with people , to art openings and little dinner parties in the newly fashionable arrondissement near the Bastille . She falls in love with Paris again , its cream and golden buildings , its wide romantic vistas . She can not imagine being with Frank on the Left Bank . They 'd be staying at the George V , they 'd go to the Louvre and tire quickly , they 'd meet his American friends in restaurants on the Right Bank , where they 'd drink and laugh . Frank would complain about the snotty attitude of the French , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bateau wearing a perfect white dress . They 'd make love in rooms with long windows . Sheer curtains would billow in and change the light . They 'd enjoy Paris , but she would n't have time to hold it close . <p> One day , following a lengthy visit to the Louvre , Lise goes into the Tuileries and sits down . Not long after , a woman in her mid-fifties drags one of those green-backed slatted park chairs from its accustomed place and sets it down in the middle of the golden gravel path . She wears one black hose with a seam , the other leg bears a drawn-on line . She carries what looks to be a good but worn crocodile bag . She wears carefully applied but heavy makeup : very black brows , very red lips . Her dyed black hair is not well cut but approximates a sophisticated , severe style , straight to the ears and with deep bangs . Taken with her odd glamour , Lise thinks the woman was probably beautiful once . <p> Lise watches as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their positioning seems important to her , but she struggles to avoid running her remaining stocking . Her bag keeps getting in the way . Lise feels a small impulse to help her , it would be so easy . But , of course , she only watches . Finally satisfied with the arrangement of the chairs , the woman sits down on one , spreads her legs quite widely apart , then places one knee up on the other chair . Uncomfortable , Lise looks away for a moment but ca n't resist turning back . <p> When she does , she sees a man standing directly in line with the angled chair in which the woman sits . He wears a good camel-hair coat . His hands are at work under it , as he watches the black-haired woman with her legs spread . Lise , fascinated , looks directly at the woman 's face . Her head is tilted back slightly ; sickle-shaped shadows cut arcs beneath her heavy brows . Her nose casts a short dagger of shadow to her very red and not quite parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He finishes his business , turns his back away from the path , and disappears . The woman composes herself and returns the chairs to their rightful places , then walks off . Lise sits dumbfounded , then she puts her hand up over her mouth and laughs . This is one for Frank . <p> Lise wanders through the little streets near boulevard St. Michel . The buildings , now steam-cleaned white , she recalls from her earliest visits as being tobacco-colored and soft gray-green . She stops at a cafe and buys a copy of the Herald Tribune . She checks out the weather page . There are storm warnings in the Caribbean ; the black concentric lines on the map alarm her . She worries about Frank in the waters off Bermuda , mixed up with halyards and jib sheets and great tossing waves . She thinks of the Triangle . Then , quickly , she computes the time change and tries to imagine him cozy in his cabin or drinking coffee with his shipmates at dawn . <p> That night in bed , to help her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Frank made love . Like a lullaby , the memory is sweet and ends happily . The pictures in her head are clear and never changing . And though she no longer trusts their accuracy , they never fail to make her think tenderly of Frank . Details stand out in sharp focus against a blurry background : his fingers on a button pulling the thick blue fabric of his shirt , his ear flat against his head and the sharp long line of his jaw , the white lace of her cotton nightgown stuck to his smooth chest . She pictures her own arms around his curving back , the freckles on his shoulders . She recalls how he 'd cried out sharply when he 'd come so swiftly , and how he 'd laughed with embarrassment a moment later . She thinks of the weight of his arm across her hip and his purplish eyelids and the slight whitening at the bridge of his nose and his breath just inches from her face . <p> The next day , in the fragrant dark of Notre Dame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shallow step in front of a crucifix . The woman wears a plain shirtwaist dress , an ugly modern dress that scarcely accommodates her bulk . Her purse , square and black with a short strap , swings at the crook of her elbow . Her hands are lifted , palms together in prayer , as she kneels before the crucifix . Her toes , in clunky shoes , barely touch the stone step . Her weight is centered in her thick body , held with perfect poise . Struck by the woman 's unblinking eyes , her unmoving muscles , Lise watches for a long time . She even thinks of moving on , but is held there . Kneeling in her ill-fitting clothes , transfixed before that cruel symbol , a man impaled , the woman is frozen except for the slight swinging of her purse as it moves to the pulse of her heart . <p> Lise is humbled . Devotion like this , if someone described it to her  --  as she imagines she will describe it later to Frank  --  would sound foolish . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented itself to Lise through the gesture of the praying woman . The Margaux , so rich and mellow at lunch , is sour in her mouth . She is not blessed , and she knows that her knees will never balance her in painless exaltation . She walks quickly out of the cathedral , runs across the street through the crowd of gaudy tourists and respectable Parisians in their somber clothes . She runs , and her heart thuds in her chest . <p> Lise returns to New York and tells her friends how wonderful her trip had been . There are no messages from Frank , who should have been back for nearly a week by now . At first she 's not bothered , they are not new lovers needing to know one another 's every move . They simply are . Yet , there is a tacit understanding about time and its significance . And there are needs . <p> It has now been two weeks and a day since Lise 's return . Tired of looking and looking at the phone , she picks it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bad play . Each of them had received tickets from friends in the production . He had given her his card just as the lights signaled the start of the long second act . Now , Lise makes a date for dinner with him , and even before the phone is in its cradle , she wants to cancel . She does n't want to talk to this man . She wants to talk to Frank . Before she goes on the date , she buys a new pair of shoes from Manolo Blahnik . They are beautiful , but they hurt her feet . <p> The man chastely dines with her and never flirts , but holds her wrist from time to time , to emphasize a point . Watching her hands describe an abstraction , a narrowing idea widening out , he says , " What a beautiful gesture ! " <p> The next day , Derrick , an old friend , calls . <p> " God , Der , it 's been forever . How the hell are you ? " Lise smiles , standing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm great , great , " Derrick says . " In fact , I 'm in town to direct a fundraising film for the Episcopal Church . You know , tasteful , with a little MTV . " <p> " Sounds about right . How 's Susie ? " <p> " She 's good . In fact she 's coming in on Friday at the end of the shoot . And we thought , kinda after Twig called about poor old Frank , that some of the old gang might get together , you know ... " <p> " Frank ? " Lise sits down on the bed . <p> " Oh , jeez , maybe you did n't hear about it ? Have you been in touch with Frank at all ? " Derrick says , his voice all wound up now . <p> " What about Frank ? " Lise says , trying to keep her breathing even . She 's slipping down a hollow black tube . <p> " Oh , Christ , well , it seems he was sailing with some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those guys . And well , apparently there was this weird squall , like some sort of tornado out on the water , some spout thing , just awful . And they all bought it , the crew , everyone . Busted up the whole boat , the , the ... " <p> " Poseidon , " Lise says . <p> " Yeah , the Poseidon . What a bitch . Do you think you 'll go to the memorial service ? Twig said it was going to be at ... " Lise has stopped listening . She would not be going to any memorial service . Derrick 's voice disappears as she puts the phone down . <p> Lise gets up off the bed . She goes down the hall . She walks around and around in a circle in the living room . She sits down on one chair after another . She walks back to the bedroom and lies down and gets up again . She does n't take her coat off . There is nothing to do . No one to call . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lise visits the Met , her favorite museum . She stands in front of the three Vermeers in salon 12 . She starts to cry . It is the tender light through the wimple on the woman in the painting on the right , Young Woman with a Water Jug . It is the ewer and the flat bowl in which it stands , and the perfect mirroring of the Persian rug beneath it . Calmer , but with tears still hanging off her lashes , she stares at the woman playing a lute in the picture on the left and at the unearthly translucence of her brown hair , its feeling of double exposure . It shimmers and sets the woman 's quiet vitality against the flawless rendition of objects and their reflections : a chair with carved lion heads , the map of Europe  --  a difficult thing to do , paint a map so it feels like a map . Lise stands motionless in front of the picture . She recalls the suspenseful moments before Frank would arrive , and how , really , there were so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching out the window , watching so intently with a play of a smile , a little push of pleasure in the muscles of her mouth . A woman waiting to please . <p> <p> By Jill Bossert <p>
