When a flu epidemic hit Georgia in 1938 , it felled the only available white doctor in Jasper and Putnam counties , left hundreds of his rural patients with one hard-to-swallow recourse . They had to call on gentle Dr. Frederick D. Funderburg , a Negro physician . Working virtually around the clock , Dr. Funderburg attended as many as 60 white patients a day , succeeded in checking the epidemic . <P> Convinced of his skill , grateful whites have been calling on him ever since with all sorts of ailments . The relationship between a Negro doctor and white Georgians was awkward at first , but Dr. Funderburg 's competence has won him respect . Now 57 , he shuttles busily between modest frame offices in both counties , where whites wait their turn along with Negroes . Among white people who visit him regularly are a bank official , a school teacher , several members of prominent Georgia families . <P> With a new flu season , Dr. Funderburg was not the only Negro who was overcoming prejudice with skill . Many a white Southerner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Negro for help . <P> Tall , spare Dr. Joseph B. Gilbert , 47 , who practices in Georgia 's Franklin and Hart counties , got his start in 1937 . He was asked to see a 60-year-old victim of pneumonia whose white doctor was ill . Frightened but confident , Dr. Gilbert pulled his patient through . He has since treated whites continually , delivered eight white babies . <P> In the little aristocratic town of Beaufort , S.C. , brisk , 46-year-old Dr. Montgomery P. Kennedy has been at it even longer . A specialist in obstetrics , he handled his first white case-a woman with post-childbirth hemorrhage-in 1930 . He estimates that he has since delivered 85 white babies . With the local white doctors , he says he gets along " just fine , except for one Connecticut Yankee . "
