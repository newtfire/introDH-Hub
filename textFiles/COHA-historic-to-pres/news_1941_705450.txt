This is the fifth of a series of general articles on America 's industrial front It deals with companies which are the focal point of the entire defense effort  --  the machine tool makers BY 3011S A. Star Corrospondcn : of 7 he roll Street Journal CLEVELAND ? Machine tool makers are Steadily pushing their output toward those " impossible " levels asked by William S. Knudsen . It looks now as if they were going to make the grade  --  a 1941 output of $750 million , a twothirds expansion over the record production achieved last year . Their success , in turn , will make possible an on-schedule performance by producers of planes , tanks , shells and numberless other defense items . In 1939 the machine tool makers set a new output record of about $200 million In 1940 they jumped output by 125% to $450 million . Now they are called upon for another huge expansion . The increase durang the first 2 ? z .. months of this year over like 1940 period has been over 80 ' , . Production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tool Builders ' Association has lust conepleted a survey covering 95 , , of the industry that showed February shipments were $52.100,000 . March output is running above February indicating first quarter pi production at an annual rate of over $620 million and present signs arc that April , M turn . will exceed March . How The Job Wan Tackled The way in which three leading machine tool companies have tackled the problem gives a cross-section picture of how the industry is attaining the further increases in production . The programs these firms are following indicate that machine tool output is going to continue to rise . Subcontracting. despite the many difficulties it presents , promises to be one of the most important ways in which machine tool output will be raised this year About 10 , , of the industry 's current production has been achieved through subcontracting and the proportion is rising . Where it is practically impossible to farm out work , firms are expanding their plants further and making every effort to get the last ounce of output out of their present equipment . Subcontracting provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other types of production ' Tolerances required ? some pieces must be accurate to 1/20 of a human hair  --  make it next to impossible for many shops to do work for a machine tool company . Close supervision and inspection is essential . Although this makes it difficult to have work done at any great distance machine tool builders here in some cases are using subcontractors located as far away as New York . Another obstacle to subcontracting is that it costs a machine tool company on the average about 50 ' . - more to farm out work than it would to do the job in its own plant . In some cases , cost of obtaining an item through subcontracting is three or four times higher . Machine tool companies are generally absorbing this increased cost rather than passing it on in higher prices . One of the main reasons subcontractors ' costs are higher is that they are not familiar with the required operation . While subcontracting has long been practiced by the automobile and other mass production industries , it has not been practical in machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in normal times Warner &; Swa .. ey Operations The Warner di S ? asey Co. , largest producer of turret lathes in the country , more than doubled the dollar value of shipments in 1940 as compared with 1939 . This was accomplished by making three successive plant additions that increased floor area by one-third , operating on a 24-hour a day basis . and by adding workers The number employed at the end of 1940 was 56% more than a year earlier and 104% over September , 1939 , when the war began . Although 1940 output far surpassed that of any previous year in the company 's history , defense requirements are so heavy that there is need for much greater capacity to produce turret lathes . Continuing the policy which the company has been following , a survey was made of 200 companies to determine how the volume of subcontracting could be increased . After deciding which firms had Capacity for doing the required work . Warner &; Swaaey was able to secure 35 additional subcontractors , all but two of which are in the Cleveland area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranging from automobile to office equipment . Working on the theory that the beat way to control the quality of materials obtained by subcontracting is through rigid inspection of parts at the time of assembly , Warner &; Swasey farms out only individual items . The company does not subcontract sub-assemblies or whole machines . Warner &; Swasey is using 15,000 square feet of floor space to assemble 1,500 machine tools on order from England . Practically an the parts are obtained for these machines from subcontractors . By May , output of these units is expected to reach 200 machines a month . In addition , the company farms out a few items for machine tools in the factory on regular production schedules . This is being done to ease shortages that develop from time to time . In the best months of 1929 and 1937 , Warner &; Swasey turned out about 150 machines . At present production is about 400 machines a month , only a small part of which reflects subcontracting . Extending the practice of subcontracting , the company hopes to almost double the output in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the machines being made for England are smaller and cost less than most models , the rise in dollar value of shipments may be somewhat smaller than that in units . National Acme Output The National Acme Co , a leading producer of multiple spindle automatics and verticle tapping machines , more than tripled its 1940 production as compared with 1939 . This was done without expanding through constructing of new buildings . New equipment was purchased , operations were boosted to a three-shift , 24 hour a day basis , and employment was raised to 2,750 production workers at the end of 1940 from 1.100 a year earlier . ' hrough its sales f.crec , Nr .. tionni Acme was able to learn of firms that might serve as subcontractors . Individual items are now being made for National Acme by 20 different companies and three others are assembling whole machines on a subcontract basis . The subcontractors are located as far away as Brooklyn , N. Y. The cost of production under the " farm out " plan is. of course , considerably higher but output and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of National Acme in 1937 was 51 machines . When wax began in September , 1939 , output was about 3C machines a month . By December . 1940 , production was up to 100 machines and in February 1941 , 120 units were shipped . In February , 1941 , National Acme received 15 machines from one of the three companies building whole uruts . By this summer , the three subcontractors making whole machines are expected to be turning out 60 units a month Thi. ? would raise National Acme 's production tr. 165 machines a month . Paralleling this upward trend , the company 's monthly billings were about $400,000 in August , 1939 . In December 1940 , they were about $1.600,000 and for Febru ? ary. 1941. they amounted to about $2,000,000 . Monarch Machine Tool The Monarch Machine Tool Co. , a leading producer of engine and tool room lathes , in creased production in 1940 by almost two anc one-half times . To accomplish this , the corn pany has completed three additions to its plan since the middle of 1939 that increased floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of 1940 from 648 a the close of 1939 . Operations have been raisec to , two-shift , 22-hour a day basis , six days week . Located in Sidney , a small town of 11,001 inhabitants in central Ohio , Monarch has re lied for the most part on plant expansions fo : raising output . Although it is obtaining part from six sub-contractors , the increase in it own plant capacity will be the most importan factor in boosting production over the coming months . During the best month in 1937 , Monarch ' . shipments were about $200,000 . In February 1941 , they were about $970.000 , and this wont they will top $1,000,000 for the first time ii the company 's history . Shipments in Januar ; and February were 120% greater than durinl the corresponding months of 1940 . The company 's last plant addition will cos about $650.000 for the building and equipment The building has just been completed and considerable amount of the new machine too equipment already has been received and is i operation and delivery of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is expected to provide enough additions capacity to enable Monarch to keep shipment at a level of 100% or more in number of me chines and dollar volume for the year 194 as a whole over 1940.
