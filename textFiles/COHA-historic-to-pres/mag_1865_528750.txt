LETTER TO A YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER . YOU know , dear M. , it is said that in times of bankruptcy men go home to get acquainted with their wives ; perhaps it should be added that wives then go to get introduced to their kitchens . But your sensible letter is an omen , little friend , that to you and H. this does not apply . You will not wait for poverty to teach you economy , but will learn economy to ward off poverty . So herewith I send a few of the culinary notes of the last two years ; but neither of us is to be taken for a bankrupt 's wife , for all that . It is simply recognizing that you are alone in new duties , and that cookery is an art which may not be gained even from that fountain of knowledge , named by the Apostle Paul as one 's husband . The successes of the art no one knows better than he ; but of the processes he will be found sublimely ignorant . There are but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - punch and lobster-salad . These , like swearing and smoking , are strictly masculine accomplishments . If you had the thrifty maiden aunt kept in reserve by most families for an emergency , you would kindly offer her a home at your house for a while . But since you have not , I will be as disagreeable to you as she . So turn your glowing Spanish eyes toward me , instead of looking demurely about , as people do when they are having old letters read to them . Byron said he hated to see a woman eat ; and there is a class of housekeepers who certainly return the compliment upon men . These ethereal beings are forever sighing for life with appetite left out . Like Lord Dundreary 's lady-love , they are " so delicate , " unless caught in the pantry hastily devouring onions and beefsteak . To he hungry is so vulgar ! One should live by nothing grosser than inhalation , and should never have an appetite greater than that of a healthy bumble-bee . But , thanks to the robust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , this puerile class is diminishing . For who can doubt that the senses are entitled to their full blossom ? Gustation was meant to be delightful ; and cooking is certainly half as good as tasting . At times one may have longed for the old Roman custom of two meals a day , and going to bed at chicken-time , bringin the hour of roast near the hour of roost ; but this was Let/er to a Young Housekeeper . // probably in families where there were three repasts , with lunch all the way between , and an incessant buying of cookies from the baker , lest the children should go hungry . After this surfeit one pardons a recoil . Or , in an enervating day of July , one may have longed to dine upon humming-bird , with roseleaves for dessert . But these are exceptional times ; the abiding hope is , that we shall continue to eat , drink , and be merry . For the practical is in the imperative . It is cumulative , and reinforces itself , - a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must march beside it with patient , cheery hearts . Is it strange that even the moss-covered Carlisle town , of which the Last Minstrel sang , and where the Scottish Mary tarried in her flight from the cousin queen , is now chiefly remarkable for its cotton-factory and biscuit-bakery ? Indeed , the enthusiasm over biscuits has its place , as well as that over books ; and it is not always that there is as much genuine joy in a novel as one may get out of bread-making . This is quite too scientific and interesting to be left to a domestic . It is really among the most exciting experiments . Try it every week for two years , and it seems just as new an enterprise as at the beginning , - but a thousand times more successful , we observe . Working up the light drifts of flour , leaving them at night a heavy pat and nothing more , - waking to find a dish flowing-full of snowy foam . The first thing on rising one 's self is , to see if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to be early , for every batch of bread sets an alarm in one 's brain . After breakfast one will be as expectant as if going to a ball in lieu of a baking . Then to see the difference a little more or less flour will make , and out of what quantity comes perfection ! To feminine vision , more precious than " apples of gold in pictures of silver " are loaves of bread in dishes of tin . If one were ever penurious , might it not be of these handsome loaves of hers ? The little housewife will be very gentle to the persecuted man of Scripture who was so reluctant to get up at midnight and give away his bread . She will even be charitable to the stingy merchant scorned by Saadi , of whom it was written , that , " if , instead of his loaf of bread , the orb of the sun had been in his wallet , nobody had seen daylight in the world till the Day of Judgment . " Dr. Kane says , he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saleratus , or shortening , - knows , but sha' n't tell . This must be another mystery of the Arctic regions . Certainly that bread could not have been raised in the sun . But how one quantity was managed the Doctor is free to say . He kneaded a whole barrel of flour in a pickled-cabbage cask , and baked it at once by firing several volumes of the " Penny Cyclop*edia of Useful Knowledge . " After compliments , however , to come in with the cash down of the practical , here is a veritable bread-making recipe , well-tested and voted superior . Take a quart of milk ; heat one third and scald with it a half-pint of flour ; if skimmed milk , use a small piece of butter . When the batter is cool , add the remainder of the milk , a teacup of hopyeast , a half- tablespoon of salt , with flour to make it quite stiff . Knead it on the board till it is very fine and smooth ; raise over night . It will make two small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give good bread week in and week out , so saving you from the frequent calamity of soda-biscuits . These may be used for dumplings , or as a sudden extempore , but do not let them be habitual . True , you will occasionally meet people who say that they can eat these , when raised ones are fatal . But some persons find cheese good for dyspepsia , many advocate icecream , others can eat only beans , while some are cured by popped corn . Yet these articles are not likely to become staples of diet . They would hardly answer a normal appetite ; and any stomach that can steadily withstand the searchingness of soda and tartaric acid // seems ready to go out to pasture and eat the fences . Chemists will say , if bread must be improvised , use soda and muriatic acid . These combined in precise proportions are supposed to evaporate in the baking , and leave common salt . But this acid is such furious stuff ! It will come to you from the druggists in a bottle marked " Poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's mouth a substance that will burn a hole in her apron . It is too much of the Roland for an Oliver , - You eat me and I will eat you . For it is quite difficult to perfectly combine the acid and alkali , and then the bread is streaked with muriatic fire ; then one might easily take into the system a thousand streaks a year , and then one would become a fire-eater . But probably the greatest of all bread wonders are the unleavened Graham cakes . These are worth a special mail and large postage to tell of . I was about to beg that you surprise H. with them at your next breakfast . But no , he wo n't like them ; besides , according to the theory of " Woman and her Era , " they re a deal too good for men , they are fit only for women and angels . So just salt and scald some Graham meal into a dough as soft as can be and be handled . Roll it an inch thick , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust into the hottest of ovens . ( Note this last direction , or the diamonds will be flat leather . ) Strange to say , they will rise , and keep rising , till in ten minutes you take them out quite puffed . One would never guess them innocent of yeast . An inch thick is the rule ; but there is nothing like an adventurous courage . It is at once suggested , if they are so bood at an inch , will they hot be twice as good at two inches . And certainly they are . The meal will not be outwitted . It is. the liveliest and most buoyant material . Its lightness keeps up with the utmost experiment . Finally , it may be turned into a massive loaf , and with a brisk heat it will refuse to be depressed . The morning when were produced these charming little miracles remains a red-letter day in our household . Who ever tasted anything , save a nut , half so sweet , or who ever anything so pure ? We ate , lingered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed as if all our lives we had been seeking something really reckercke " , and had just found it . They were as great a revelation to the palate as Bettine or Thoreau might be to the mind . Now all was couleur de rose . Here was found , if not the philosopher 's stone , the philosopher 's bread , that should turn everything into health . Henceforth the strong heroes celebrated by Emerson , who " at rich men 's tables eat but bread and pulse , " might sit at ours , arising refreshed and glorified . And was not this also coming very near Nature ? but two removes from the field , wheat cracked , then ground . ( I have since come a degree nearer on cracked wheat at a water-cure ! ) It sounded altogether wholesome and primitive . I hastened with a sample to my best friend . She , too , tasted , exulted , and passed on the tidings to others . Now , indeed , was the golden age in dawn . Already we saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad blood would disappear , and already the crowns of grateful generations were pressing on our brows . But something went wrong with all the cooks . Either they did n't scald the meal or they did n't heat the oven , - what in one hand was light beaten gold in another became lead . For a while it seemed that I could not go to my friend 's without meeting some one who cast scorn on our reformation cakes . All tried them and failed ; so sin remains in the world . But now hope plumes itself anew . You at least will attempt the little wheatens . You have a deft hand , and will succeed . The buoyancy of the meal revives in my blood . Now the world ribhts itself again , and once more we are all bounding sunward . But to be honest . For a few weeks I and the radical cakes were as satisfied as young lovers , but soon came temptations to progress from the primitive , - first to add a little sugar . But I vetoed 537 // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the bars between the wheat-field and cane-field , or probably by this time I should have been pouring in spice , eggs , and milk , and at last should have committed the crime of doing just as other people do . If you would confess it , you have probably found in your new captaingeneral a susceptibility not only to your charms , but to those of good cooking . Always count these among the young wife 's fascinations . Remember how Miss Bremer 's Fannie , of " The Neighbors , " in a matrimonial quarrel with her Bear , conquered him with fresh-baked patties aimed at his mouth . But be not too conciliatory , - especially towards coffee . If you could be hard-hearted enough to win H. from this bilious beverage , would it not be worth the perils ? Entertain him for a few mornings so brilliantly that he wo n't know what he is drinking , then - But I 11 tell you how we will cheat him admirably ; and it is n't very cruel either , for merely to gratify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one knows Taraxacum or dandelion ; invalids know crust-coffee , and many with indignation know burnt peas . Also Miss Beecher , whose estimable cookbook you certainly must get , mentions that ochra seeds or gumbo can not be told from Java ; an army correspondent has since reported coffee made at the South from oker seeds , doubtless the same ; another found in use the sweet potato , roasted , and flavored with coffee ; while a friend has just described the most enticing beverage made from chickory , - the root being stripped and dried under the stove . This is said to be so rich that sometimes it has to be diluted with a trifle of coffee . And still further , there is simple rye , which is cheaper found than either . Jeff . Davis drank it for four years and wrote all her grand proclamations out of it . But probably the wholesomer article is wheat coffee . I have lately prepared some by boiling a cup of well-scorched wheatbran in a pint of water ; and although I do n't quite know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the true Java . It poured clear and rich as wine . Now try this in full strength with your spouse , being very witty when he drinks . And as the mornings pass , oh , weaken it more and more . That is , cheat him pleasantly at first , then worse and worse , till he is glad to take milk or pure water with you . Conspiracies are usually contemptible ; but this is one of the very " best water , " you see . Perhaps we who never drink coffee can hardly understand the affection its votaries have for it . To their minds , water seems to be given only for steeping that delicious mud . Said one extravagant Madame Follet , " When I see a coffee-pot , t is exactly the same as if I saw an angel from heaven . " And the Biloxi people , whom General Butler surprised of a morning , were found to be in a very tragic state . One boy exclaimed , " Oh , give me just a handful of coffee , master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything ! " while a strong man ejaculated , " My God , we re short of everything ! I have n't tasted tea or coffee for four months ! " - as grievous as if he had n't seen a human face for a year . According to the " Herald " correspondent , the chief reason that the South rejoices in peace is that " Now we 11 be able to get some real coffee ! " - perhaps , he adds , in the next breath inquiring , " What are you going to do with our niggers ? " No , we could not , with Ward Beecher , " bless the man who discovered the immortal berry . " Nor could we , with De Quincey , apostrophize to a certain other excitant , " 0 just , subtle , and mighty opium ! thou boldest the keys of Paradise ! " Yet one must concede the possible uses of a stimulant . Coffee has been priceless to our army , on its cold , wet marches ; and benedictions should be ordered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it into that wondrous pemmican , so that the coffee of a regiment may be carried in a few tin cans . Then , too , it seems good for men who go driving up and down the world on stage-coaches and locomotives ; but for stay - at - home , // counting-house mortals , is it not a mere delicious superfluity ? Quite as much of one as a cigar , I think . But henceforth , when Rio is high , drink rye . If one must have either , better the simulant than the stimulant . Among other things , you have 4oubtless discovered that one admirable breakfast dish is eggs . If you serve them in the shell , it is quite worth while to follow the English way , keeping them close covered for ten minutes in very hot water without boiling . The yolks are thus left running , and the whites are beautifully jellied . These are convenient to get when relations arrive at night , and , there is no meat in the house . Relations always expect meat for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one 's genius is to come in , - when a nice meal must be gotten at short notice , and the larder is empty . None but the woman of resources can do it ; and she knows her realm is as full of strategies as was ever the Department of the Potomac . Under her hand , when there was supposed to be nothing for breakfast , I have seen bits of meat snatched from cold soup , and wrought up into the most savory morsels , - one would never guess that the goodness was all boiled out of them ; while a cup of yesterday 's griddle-cake batter went suddenly into the oven , and came out a breakfast-cake finer than waffles . One who had the knack of the heroine Fleda , in " Queechy , " would be friendly to omelets , and tell of them too . But you must be self-reliant , and put them on the list of experiments . It will probably be some time before you come to that refinement of egg-eating which Mrs. Stowe found at the mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lunch . Her sylvan spirit was somewhat startled , when a servant brought five little speckled plover eggs , all lying in the nest just as taken from the tree . How they were cooked is unknown ; but one would certainly need a recipe to eat them by . But an American woman can outdo the Duchess of Sutherland . She will find an egg daintier than the plover 's , and not stir from her own door ; for , awhile since , some one , fumbling among the secrets of Nature , discovered , not that stones were sermons , but that snow was eggs , and straight made a cookbook to tell it , as we will do on discovering that rain is milk . Of course all things have their limitations ; and these new eggs are not just the article for custards , will not do to poach for breakfast , or would hardly keep in brine ; but they may be used in any compound that requires lightness without richness . Even our grandmothers made snow pancakes ; but , in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' in this experiment one need not stop short of veritable loaf-cake . The volatile element in snow makes two table-spoons of it equal to one egg ; therefore to a small loaf I should allow ten tablespoons . Cooks always put in as many eggs as they can afford , you know . Thus , when snow falls every day for four months , as it does in New England , eggs get exceedingly cheap in the prudent household . Then one can smile to think how she circumvents the grocer , and pray the clouds to lay a good nestful every week . A friend the other day improvised a list of edibles headed , " Poisonous Es , " - pastry , pickles , pork , and preserves . She was pleased to leave out puddings , and hereto we shall say , Amen . Not that one is to indorse such odiously rich ones as cocoa-nut , suet , and English plum ; but , hating these , there are enough both nice and wholesome to change the dessert every day for a fortnight , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipes , with various items by this writing omitted . Pastry the physiologists have been shaking their heads about for some time , - especially as many persons use soda with the lard , not being aware that they are making soft soap . This sort of paste one often sees in the country . But it is easy to omit the soap . On the next bread-making day , simply reserve a piece of the well-raised dough , and roll in butter . This gives a palata // 540 ble and harmless crust . I have also experimented with a shortening of hot , fine-mashed potato and milk , which , if it may not be recommended to an epicure , is really better than it sounds . And does it not sound better than Dr. Trall 's proposal of sweet oil ? Will not some of these ways satisfy our ardent reformers and physiologists ? But about chicken-pie , remember the tradition , that , unless the top crust is punctured , it will make one very ill . ( Who knows but this was the secret of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truer than some other traditions , such as that eating burnt crusts will make the cheeks red , or that fried turnip will make the hair curl . Pickles do not seem so good that they must be eaten , nor so bad that they must not be . But with them comes evermore the vision that Trollope has prepared of all our smart little five-yearold men and women perched at hoteltables , pale-faced and sedate , with waiters behind their chairs , and ordering chowders and chops with an inevitable " Please do n't forget the pickles . " Preserves , aside from the recent luxury of canned fruit , have the happiest substitutes , if we will take what the seasons bring to our hands . Not a month in the year is left wholly barren of these relishes for the tea-table . There are berries all the summer , apples and cranberries in the winter , when , just as the last russet disappears , and with it every one 's appetite , up springs the pungent and luxuriant rhubarb . Somewhat curious is it concerning this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment in England , that a Mr. Myatt , who took seven bundles of it to London , succeeded in selling but three . Still he persisted in keeping it before the people , although he seemed only to lose rhubarb and to gain ridicule , being designated as the man who sold " physic pies . " And besides our own zone , with its fruits fresh or dried , there are the abounding tropics always at the door : Pine-apples , which , if unwholesome , are yet charmingly convenient to help a luckless housekeeper , and which , by the way , made a better en/ne in London than pie-plant , being so popular that their salesmen floated flags from the top of their stalls ; bananas , those foreign muskmelons of spring ; oranges , gilding every street-corner ; dates , which do not go meanly with bread and butter , though one is a little fearful of finding a whole straw bed therein ; and prunes , which , if soaked several hours and stewed slowly , are luscious enough for a prince . But pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do without . Certainly he must have partaken somewhat of its nature to make him so greedy ; and there would seem to be animals enough on land and sea , without devouring the swine . If pork be important anywhere , it is so in the old Puritan dish of baked beans ; yet those who have tasted baked beans prepared with fine rich beef instead have voted them quite sumptuous , and possibly rich enough for people who live at restaurants . But so long as fish , bird , and fowl remain , and men even eat turtles and frogs , - so long as sheep do not die of wolves , nor cattle of the county commissioners , - may not the pig be left to his wallowing in the mire ? Thus much for the poisonous j5s . We . do not place among them that popular plant , the potato , though it has the blood of the nightshade in its veins . But these may be made moderately poisonous by putting them into soup . Once taste clear potato-water , and you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even potatoes one may eat at a dozen tables , and not find nicely served at any . With domestics generally they figure as the article that in cooking takes care of itself - the convenient vegetable , that may be thrown into the kettle , and taken up when nothing else needs to be . In the end they are either half done and hard , or when done , being left soaking , are watery and soggy ; whereas they should be pared , kept boiling in salted water till they break , then drained and shaken over the coals till powdery dry . They need // tossing up with as light a hand as an omelet , you see . If they are not of the nicest variety , they should he mashed with milk , butter , and salt , and placed in the oven to brown . This is a kind of medication which usually makes the poorest article quite palatable , and is resorted to in the early summer , when potatoes are become decidedly an " aged 75 . " I was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it was " too dry . " It is doubtful what he would do in Maine , the land of the famous Jackson whites , which boil to a creamy powder . One must be grateful that our Massachusetts Dovers can not be dampened by this original potatotaster . He probably would like juicy potatoes and mealy oranges . But of course none can have studied diet and its varied effects on various persons , without seeing it to be impossible to make up two lists of dishes , one of which shall be voted hurtful and the other harmless . Nor does the healthfulness of food seem to consist wholly in its simplicity , according to old Grahamite theories . There is probably some truth in the saying of Hippocrates , " Whatever pleases the palate nourishes " ; but one can not fail to recognize the wisdom of M. Soyer , that prince of the cuisine , who maintains that the digestibility of food depends , not on the number of articles used in its manufacture , but in their proper combination . Says M. Soyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigestion to the greatest gourmet , even while using the most recherche provisions , without his being able to detect any fault in the preparation of the dishes of which he had partaken , - and this simply by improperly classifying the condiments used in the preparation . " This gives a hint of the nicety of the culinary art , the genius required to practise it , and the fine physical effects that hinge upon it . It is no wonder that Vatel committed suicide before the great banquet which he had prepared for his master , the Prince of Cond* , because he feared it was to fail . It is certainly enough to alarm ordinary amateurs , - and such are the most of us ; for , while Americans place all due stress upon the table , they neglect to emphasize the cuisine . Instead of this nonchalance , we have yet to discover that cookery belongs to the fine arts ; that it is exhaustive alike of chemistry and physiology , and touches upon laws as sure as those which mingle the atmospheric elements , hourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should count it among the best of the progressive plans of our country , if to the new Industrial College under subscription at Worcester were to be added an elaborate culinary department , with the most accomplished professor that could be obtained . Perhaps , as M. Soyer was philanthropic enough to go to the Crimea , and teach the English to make hospital soup , he would even come here and give our nation a glimpse of those marvellous morsels that have made Paris the envy of epicures the world over . And if there is a proper harmony to be attained in the combining of various ingredients , making every perfect dish a poem , there is no less harmony in combining the various dishes for a repast , making a poem in every perfect meal . For every leading dish has its kindred and antagonistic ones : as , at dinner , one would not serve cauliflower with fricasseed chicken , nor turnips with boiled salmon , nor , at tea , currants with cream-toast , nor currants with custard . But this is something that can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mercy of one 's instinct , and may be ruled by a tact as delicate as that which conducts a drawing-room . But we are quite curious to learn , M. , if your excellent companion has yet been away from home so long that you have had to go to market . And can you wisely discern roasts , steaks , and fowl ? Says one , " The way to select fowl is first to select your butcher " ; and away he swings out of intelligence and responsibility with a magnificent air . A lady friend has this charming fashion of frankness : " Now , Mr. , I do n't know one piece of meat from another , and 54 ' // shall expect you to give me the best " ; thus throwing herself directly on her faith and fascinations . But these might grow jejune , nor is it safe to trust the tender mercies of a butcher . Better know what you want , and know if you get it . Therefore you will study the anatomy of animals , as laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little perplexing . I confess I am near concluding that every beef creature is a special creation ; for one never finds the same joint twice , and apparently the only things common to all are tongue and liver . Not long since , having a discussion at the market with an elderly gentleman , he said something pleasant which must be written for the husband of a young housekeeper . We agreed that a rump steak was of more uniform richness than a sirloin , the best of the latter being only that luscious strip underlying the bone . " But , " added the kindly man , " I always buy the sirloin , because I give that juicy scrap to my wife . " It is worth while , M. , to be wedded to the thoughtful heart , who , after forty years , yet wills to give one the single choice bit from the table . Aside from the ordinary beef-routine , there is another dish which is usually popular . Select a cheap , lean piece of beef weighing two or three pounds , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boiling gently . Half an hour before dinner add a small onion , a sliced parsnip and carrot , a few bits of turnip , and a half- dozen dumplings . When these are done , remove them ; season and thicken , serving a dumpling with meat and vegetables to each plate of stew . This may be rather plebeian , but is certainly palatable , - unless there be choice company to dine . We might call it Rainy-Day Stew . But the toothsome time for beef-eaters was undoubtedly in the days of pleuro - pneumonia . Then the frightened public fled from beef as from the plague , and all the best cuts were left for the bold . One was tempted to pray that such pleuro might last for the season , save that the Commissioners were so costly , and the dear cattle were having an unusually sanguinary Bull Run . I know what our vegetarian friend , Mr. Alcott , will say ; but he must indulge me in a very small mania , even if it seem to him a kind of cannibalism ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let them all be given to good beef . While the quarrel of round , rump , and sirloin goes on , this let us buy and eat and reinforce ourselves . In it are poems , powers , and possessions ineffable . Twenty-five cents a pound , and the strength of the gods in one 's veins ! Broil it carefully and rare , then go and toss quoits with Hercules . In this , ye disconsolate , behold lands , lovers , and virtues in plenty . It fills and steadies the pulse , and plants the planet plump under one 's feet . " My friend is he who makes me do what I can , " says the sage . Only beefsteak can come to the rescue . If one were going to a martyr 's fire , of this should he eat , lest he die , not sublimely , with a fainting body . He would try this steak , and then that stake . But there is one event that comes alike to all , and that is a holiday dinner . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that on a Christmas or Thanksgiving Nature suspends her laws and lets one eat as much as he can . It is quite in the spirit of the Scottish Lord Cockburn , who , ending a long walk , used to say , " We will eat a profligate supper ,  --  a supper without regard to discretion or digestion . " Or after the theory of one who ate whatever he pleased , whenever he pleased , and as much as he pleased , saying , " Oh , if it makes me sick , I can take medicine . What are the doctors for , if t is n't to cure people ? " He did not know how small hope can be gotten from the doctors , and how those who know best get more and more courage to travel into places where they are not . There must have been a poor chance for the Egyptians , who , Herodotus says , had aphysician for each part of the body ; so that the human frame would seem to have been a sort of university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In // 543 case of malady , every officer worked away on his own member without regard to what his medical neighbors were doing . Michelet mentions a fish that has the power of multiplying stomachs to the number of one hundred and twenty . Fortunately that power is not man 's . Think of dyspepsia with a hundred and twenty stomachs , and a different doctor for each ! Do not imagine this a plea for the transcendental diet that drove Sydney Smith to that pathetic sigh , " Ah , I wish they would allow me even the wing of a roasted butterfly ! " But perhaps it would not be amiss to conjure up a terror-demon from these bodies of ours , so that we should fear to violate laws with such merciless penalties ,  --  should have none but well-cooked food , at sensible and systematic hours . Is it strange that little Miss Bremer , who thought herself of soundest digestion , after three months of American night-dinners with oysters and preserve , is at last seen to grasp Dr. Osgood with both hands , exclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to save you from resembling the great people of the world after the manner of Dr. Beattie , whose title to genius was , " Have I not headaches like Pope , vertigo like Swift , gray hairs like Homer ? Do I not wear large shoes for fear of corns like Virgil , and sometimes complain of sore eyes like Hor-ace ? " Therefore I hope that your H. will make the counting - room conform to regular mid-day dinner and early teatime . And let us trust that it will not have the same fatal result as with King Louis XII. , who is said to have died earlier from changing his dinner-hour in compliment to his foreign bride . One can hardly think of late suppers without turning quite away to those ideal tea-takings of the Wordsworths at Grasmere . " Plain living and high thinkino " was the motto of the philosopher-poet , and that table was never crowded with viands . One can well believe , that , as De Quincey said , in the quiet walks after tea the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But he probably was thinking very high when he drew a knife from the buttered toast and cut the leaves of a new book just lent to him ! Quite sombre are the memories of Rydal Mount ; but since we are really alive , let us be lively . Behold me , then , dear M. , well turbaned and aproned , and know that this is our churningday . You give one of your gleeful little shrieks , perhaps ; but yes , it is true ; we live in the city , take a pint of milk per day , and make butter . And where is the churn ? you suggest . Oh , I extemporize that . It is out of the question to buy every convenient thing , or purse will run dry and house overflow . Dr. Kane hints how few dishes it is possible to use ; and the plan is admirable ; so one need not buy a churn , but make one out of a bowl and spoon . Into the bowl goes the cream , into the cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat , not as one who beateth the air . This often lasts for two hours or more ; it might be said that the cream remains in chrysalis , and refuses to butterfly ! Indeed , there is no reason why a small bowl of cream should n't te as refractory as a wooden churnful . But when it " wo n't come , " my distress is not at all proportioned to the size of the bowl . Still I beat , beat , beat , perspiringly , but resolutely , while it whisks about , spattering over face , bib , and turban . At length there appear within it greasylooking flecks . These increase till the mass thickens , beats solidly , separates from the milk , and declares itself butter . A limited quantity , certainly , but I will none the less press it dry , salt , and make it into cakes as large as a full-blown tea-rose . Each of these I will stamp , lay on a dapper glass cup-plate , and at tea-tfme several dear ones in various households will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are genuine love-pats ? This would be a pretty way to serve butter always , did it not remind one of cheap hotels kept on the European plan , where those small , slushy , yellow cakes come in with the rolls . A choicer way // is to form it into acorns or strawberries , - though I do n't in the least know how it is done , - placing them all together on a plate and serving one to each at the table . This dainty way , however , would hardly make a bad article good , and no one would crave a berry of ancient firkin butter . For , as trivial a matter as it seems , this single condiment of food , one has only to encounter it in a strong , cheesy state to feel it among the most important things in the cuisine . Then one suddenly discovers that butter is in everything . Eating becomes intolerable , living dwindles into dyspepsia , and finally one is tempted to exclaim with a certain epicure , " I wish I were under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " It is related of Apicius , who lived at Rome , that he ate very large shrimps ; but hearing that those of Greece were larger , he straightway sailed for that coast without losing a day . He met a great storm and much danger ; but on arriving , the fishermen brought him of their best . Apicius shook his head . " Have you never any larger shrimps ? " " No , Seignior , never ! " At which , rubbing his hands with delight , he ordered the captain to sail back at once , saying , - " I have left some at home larger than these , and they will be spoiled , if the wind is not in our favor . " We will not carry our 5iilletantism so far as this , nor let it carry us so far ; still we are glad not to be driven to the expedient of the Syrians , whose only butter is the fat procured from the tails of November , their sheep , - which is literally being reduced to extremities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first churning . I began with one cup of cream and ended with a cup of butter and a full cup of buttermilk ! This law of expansion is paralleled only by that of contraction , as shown to the farmer who took a brimming pail of dinner to the sty ; and after the little pig had eaten it all , the farmer put him into the pail , and had room for another half of a pig beside . But , dear M. , it is hardly two moons since the bridal trunks were taken from our hall , and you went away with the friend . You have scarcely been domesticated long enough to see that bright tins bake badly , and that one must crucify her pride by allowing them to blacken ; yet so soon do I overwhelm you with culinary suggestions . I am distressed to remember them . But you must forgive and smile me into peacefulness again . And be not discouraged , little housewife ! It may take years of attention to excel in bread-making , some skill even for boiling potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your servants , and watch their processes patiently . Take notes , experiment , amend , and if there be failure , discover the reason ; then it need not happen again . And despite the difficulties of the practical , you and H. will not slight the ideal . Love the work you are doing and must do ; but when it is done , oh , train the rose-vines over your door !
