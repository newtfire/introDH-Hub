A few days after the great Dr. Hideyo Noguchi died in Africa ( TIME , May 28 ) under the hot sun of northeastern Japan a woman was spading her wheat fields . Her hands were squarish ; the palms rough , the backs faintly ridged with thin veins . Her face , rugged and serene , showed her 50 odd years . <P> Over the fields a stranger approached . She shaded her eyes with a hand and saw that he wore a black frock coat . His walk was diffident as well as awkward . She waited for him to come close . And her eyes widened as the ill forecast of his roundabout phrases became intelligible . Her brother , the great , the famed , the honorable , the revered Dr. Hideyo Noguchi was dead . She put her hands to her face and cried . Her spade fell over into the clods . <P> As happened so generally in Japan , especially a generation ago , Noguchi 's sister had toiled with their family to get him an education . They saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German , that he attended the Tokyo Medical College . When he became a doctor ( 1897 ) he got an assistantship at the Tokyo General Hospital ; and thereafter his way was his own . He always kept an affectionate contact with his family . <P> Last week Japanese women , who have endured like Noguchi 's sister , became openly irate over the present condition of medicine in Japan . The country has few great physicians and surgeons . But the average of the profession is far below the U. S. average . Quackery , magic and hokus-pokus are all too prevalent . <P> The medical schools draw much condemnation . They give , the angry women declare , their medical degrees too facilely , particularly the highest , the Igakuhakushi . Any medical student who offers a smart thesis apparently can get the degree . Clinical experience is little required and some of those Igakuhakushi have been acting like scoundrels . They charge high fees ; they write demoralizing articles on sex matters ; they sign advertisements ; they give testimonials . The women demand that the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization function actively like the American Medical Association to reprove and reprimand unethical Japanese doctors .
