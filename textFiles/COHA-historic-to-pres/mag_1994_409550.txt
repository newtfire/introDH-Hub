Any angler who 's just bent all five blades of a $600 stainless-steel bass boat propeller can see the wisdom of jet propulsion . Water jet drives are currently all the rage in the pleasure-boat market with names like Sea Rayder , Jazz , Fling and Rush underlining the splash-and-dash fun of a personal watercraft combined with the practicality of a small boat . Those things are cute , but what fishermen need is a water-going version of a sport-utility truck , not a Miata . BUILT FOR BACKWATER Now several longtime specialists in building fishing rigs , not runabouts , are getting into the market . They include Pro-Line , Tracker Marine and RichLine . These new jet-drive models are intended to take the stress out of navigating through stump-infested backwaters or tricky tidal flats . Make no mistake , these are genuine fishing boats , with casting platforms , center consoles and aluminum and fiberglass construction to choose from . The new breed of jet-drive fishing boats should not be confused with the bellowing V8-powered jet craft . These small fishing rigs trace their origins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Both the Mercury and Outboard Marine Corporation ( OMC )  --  Evinrude and Johnson  --  drives are based on two-stroke , outboard power heads . The Mercury SportJet uses a 90 hp , three-cylinder , 1,231cc engine that 's seen duty for years on Force outboards . The OMC TurboJet is powered by a 1,632cc oil-injected V4  --  rated at 90 hp or 115 hp  --  designed for Johnson and Evinrude outboards . Both the Mercury and OMC drive systems locate the engine vertically over the pump . Bevel gears link the vertical drive shaft to the pump 's horizontal impeller shaft . The jet pump itself is similar in concept to a jet aircraft engine . Water is drawn into the pump through an intake in the boat bottom . The fanlike impeller , turned by the engine , compresses water against a stator , or fixed set of fins , and pushes it through a narrow nozzle at the aft end of the pump . The resulting thrust propels the boat forward and is expressed in " pounds of static thrust , " literally the force measured on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steering is accomplished by aiming the pivoting jet nozzle left or right , and reverse thrust is created by dropping a diverter , or " bucket , " over the nozzle , which , in a manner of speaking , reverses the flow . The OMC TurboJet pump has a five-vane , stainless-steel impeller and an enclosed impeller shaft so that weeds or stray fishing line that enter the pump ca n't get wrapped around the shaft . The aft housing of the TurboJet pump is held shut with clamps and can be opened to clear debris from the pump from the cockpit of the boat . With other pumps you 'll have to reach into the pump from under he boat to clear clogs . The 90 hp TurboJet is rated by OMC at 650 pounds of static thrust . The 115 hp version has a 680-pound rating . The Mercury SportJet also uses a five-blade stainless-steel impeller and is rated at 650 pounds of thrust . Because the Mercury and OMC jet drives are not interchangeable , boatbuilders will probably not offer a choice of power . PUMP OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet-powered boat is its shallow draft . The pump nozzle is actually located above the boat bottom , so the keel line represents the boat 's maximum draft . A mini-jet may draw as little as six inches of water at rest and literally skim over the surface when underway . Another benefit is that because all of the jet drive 's moving parts are located within the pump , the hazard of a spinning prop is eliminated . You can also play fish around the pump nozzle without the constant fear of cutting , nicking or entangling line . But there are other considerations you should know about . A jet-drive system is typically 15 to 20 percent less efficient than a prop drive at transferring engine power to propulsive power . That is because the engine must lift water to the pump and then overcome friction of water passing through the pump housing . And although the jet pump can operate in very shallow water , it can also suck up anything loose in the water , including heavy weeds , which can clog the pump . And because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prop drive 's lower unit , a jet boat will not track as well in turns . For all their similarities , there is a great deal of diversity in jet-drive fishing boats that broadens their appeal still further . Here 's what you can find : PRO-LINE 153 STALKER This was the first dedicated fishing boat offered with jet power . It 's a mini-flats skiff with a fiberglass hull and self-draining liner made of hand-laid fiberglass filled with rigid foam . Its fore and aft casting decks are flush with the gunnels and deeply textured . A bench seat amidships seats three adults , with the helm to starboard in a small console . A circular bait well in the deck is aerated and insulated , and a fish box to port is offered with optional recirculation . Rod stowage is limited to optional vertical holders on the gunnel . Compartments port and starboard of the engine will hold coolers , tackle boxes or break-down fly rods , and there 's room for a second , trolling-motor battery . An optional poling platform fits over the engine hatch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dry ride when underway . Top speed with one person aboard is about 38 mph ; The base retail price of $8,995 does not include a trailer . TRACKER PRO 18 JET Tracker Marine has entered the jet-power market with an aluminum hull . The Pro 18 Jet looks like a large , modified-V bass boat , except that it has a carpeted hump in the aft casting deck that covers the Mercury SportJet 90 powerhead . That hump also supports an aft fishing seat . A forward casting deck holds a second fishing seat , locking stowage compartments and a rod locker . A divided , aerated live well and more stowage lie below the aft deck . All deck areas are carpetcovered , treated plywood . Three bucket seats hold the driver and passengers amidships , and instruments are mounted on a molded plastic helm console . In a stiff chop on open water , the Tracker 's flat bottom can cause the pump to briefly lose its feed of water , which causes the engine to rev momentarily . However , the Tracker is capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tracker Pro 18 Jet is sold as a package with a 12-volt , 30-pound-thrust , foot-control MotorGuide trolling motor , a Humminbird Wide Eye fish locator on the helm and a custom Trailstar trailer . Even a paddle and fire extinguisher are included in the base price of $9,495 . RICHLINE RW 175 SJ This is a welded jet-powered aluminum bass boat with a dry weight of just 889 pounds . It is a little more upscale than the Tracker , with an all-welded , 100-gauge hull , carpet-covered aluminum fore and aft casting decks and aluminum compartment hatches . The boat has stowage fore and aft , a locking rod locker , live well aft and two pedestal fishing seats . There 's amidships seating for two and a console with molded top holding engine instruments . A 12-volt MotorGuide bow-mount trolling motor , fish locator and Bear trailer are included in the base package price of $10,400 . Two other jet boats deserve the attention of anglers . Hobie Power offers the Hobie Jet skiff with a package of options aimed at the angler . The Hobie Jet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward of the engine compartment , good stowage space inside the console and room on top for electronics . The high bow gives the Hobie a dry ride , and the boat is stable at rest and when underway . A Mercury SportJet 90 and a dry weight of just 875 pounds give the Hobie a top speed of about 40 mph . Base price is $9,995 without a trailer . The fishing package includes pop-up cleats , a full wind screen and handrail , an in-deck anchor locker , full instrumentation running lights , an engine compartment divider and vertical rod holders , and boosts the price to $11,400 . A poling platform is a $525 option . Boston Whaler has redesigned its Rage 14 jet boat and added a slightly larger Rage 15 to the line . Both exhibit Whaler 's typical quality construction and design , with a foam-filled , unsinkable hull , self-draining fiberglass cockpit with center console and top-grade components throughout . The original Yamaha drive has been replaced with the new oil-injected OMC TurboJet  --  in 90 hp tune for Rage 14 and 115 hp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decks fore and aft that make good fishing platforms and have room for a large cooler forward of the console . The Rage 14 starts at $9,995 without a trailer , the Rage 15 at $11,495 without a trailer . Will we all be buying jet-drive power in the fishing boat of the future ? Doubtful , unless a substantial increase in performance is offered . And that appears to be quite a way down the road . The current generation of jet drives have low cost and reliability as their priorities . More horsepower would increase price significantly . But for now , what they do , they do well . In addition to being shallow-water experts , jet boats are inexpensive , easy to tow and to store and simple to maintain  --  just the ticket for the entry-level angler or the dedicated expert looking to add a specialized boat to his fleet .

Campbell St. , Springfield , MO 65807 ( 417-882-4444 ) . PUMPED OUTBOARDS Falling between the new compact jet drives and the muscular , V8 inboard jets are jet-pump outboards . Traditionally , outboards were converted to jet power by dealers who replaced the prop-drive gear case with a centrifugal pump manufactured by Specialty Manufacturing of San Leandro , California . In most cases , this left the dealer ( or boat owner ) with an unused gear case and a voided warranty on , what was essentially , a brand-new motor . In the late 1980s , Yamaha and Suzuki started offering outboards with the Specialty Manufacturing pump installed at the factory and backed by a warranty . Nowadays , OMC , Tohastu and Mercury Marine also offer jet-drive models , all with the same pump . Because a jet pump is less efficient , a jet outboard has lower power rating than the prop-drive version . For example , the 105 hp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hp prop-drive model . This means that you 'll also use more fuel to achieve a prop outboard 's speed and performance . And like the compact inboard jets , a jet outboard has little or no rudder effect to aid in steering . Mercury offers the widest range of power options , with seven models , from a 20 hp twin to a 140 hp V6 . A jet typically costs more than a standard outboard  --  the 150 hp Mercury mentioned above retails for $10,503 , while the 105 hp Mercury jet goes for $10,980 . Jet outboards work best on boats designed specifically for this type of propulsion . That includes a higher transom and a tunnel in the hull to funnel water up to the pump . For example , OMC 's Roughneck line , which is in its second year of manufacture , includes four welded aluminum boats ranging from 16 to 19 feet , all with a three-inch hull tunnel and are sold as a package with an OMC jet outboard . The tunnel allows motor to be mounted above the hull bottom , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water 's surface , even a partially submerged log , that would stop a prop-drive boat dead . <p>
