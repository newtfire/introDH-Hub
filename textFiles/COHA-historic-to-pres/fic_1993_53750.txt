for Melissa and Ricardoof Melissa 's Piano BarSantorini , Greece Are they crazy ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " I think my officers would like to shoot these crazy people . " <p> " Of course . But their deaths would reflect badly upon me . " <p> A white woman and two white male companions lay unmoving on the ground , on their bellies , their hands tied behind their heads . They lay in swirling pools of mud and water , rivulets coursing about them and gushing down the mountainside . A handful of soldiers , dressed in rags , dark-skinned and solemn , armed with knives and rifles , stood guard over them , displaying only marginal interest . <p> " If my officers shoot you as well then your honor would be salvaged . " <p> The speaker had given his name as Raoul ; he was questioning a boy of about twelve , who had not yet been asked how he was called . <p> A heavy , warm rain was falling , with great monotony , as had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell the crazy people if they move my officers will shoot them . " <p> " They will not move . " <p> The man poked the woman with his rifle , lifting her hair so that he could see her burnished neck . He stood between her spread legs , his shoulders slumped under the drenching rain . Around them there existed a gnarl of twisty vines and trees , and leafy , swollen vegetation , and mountains rising another ten thousand feet , though they could not see beyond their own weary group because of the rain 's steady downpour . <p> " What is the journey of these crazy people ? " <p> " Their mission is to find Kolooltopec . " <p> " But Kolooltopec does not exist . " <p> " I agree . " <p> " It does not matter whether you agree . I could agree also , but this would not change the matter . " <p> " Yes , " the boy said . " Because Kolooltopec still would not exist and you and I would both be as crazy as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . Then we are in agreement . " <p> The man stepped from between the woman 's legs and stretched his naked arm around the boy 's shoulder . They remained that way for some minutes , the three on the ground silent and unmoving , their faces all but buried within the coursing water , and the swarthy officers with their rifles muttering to themselves as they watched the rain and each other and their bedraggled prisoners on the ground . <p> " How long have you been on this journey with the crazy people ? " <p> " Five days . " <p> " Along the river ? " <p> " Two days along the river . Then we began our ascent of the mountains . " <p> " In the rain ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Then you must be from Ooldooroo . Or Moogradi . " <p> " Moogradi . It is the village of my people . " <p> " Does Ooldooroo still exist ? We have heard rumors . " <p> " I do not know . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men nearby spoke nervously of the apparent destruction of Ooldooroo . <p> " One of my officers came from Moogradi . He spoke well of the river basin and its people . " <p> The boy nodded . <p> " He is dead three years now , this man from Moogradi . " <p> The boy made a quick , violent sign of the cross , and each of the several officers within hearing did likewise , with murmurs of pain and astonishment that lifted above the rain . One of the prisoners coughed and made to stretch his legs , but quit this when he was nudged by one of the officers ' rifles . <p> " It is a poor place , Moogradi . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " An affliction . Do you agree ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Nothing stinks so much as Moogradi . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " The men of Moogradi do nothing all day long , while the women work . Is this true ? " <p> " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all ugly in Moogradi , especially the young girls . That is what I have heard . " <p> " It is very true , " the boy said . " But bless them anyhow . " <p> The man laughed harder and pounded his hand merrily on the boy 's shoulder . All the officers were laughing now and passing lewd comments back and forth . <p> " Whereas , Ooldooroo . " <p> All fell silent . <p> The three on the ground lay as though stricken and the warm rain continued to fall and the rivulets to course noisily down the mountainside . <p> " What is your name , boy from Moogradi ? " <p> " Toodoo . " <p> " Is Toodoo a good name ? " <p> " It is my parents ' good name . " <p> " But you have ugly sisters . " <p> " Yes . " <p> All laughed again , including the boy , although his face was strained and he looked on the point of exhaustion . He did not believe this man standing beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperado Raoul . <p> " My dead officer from Moogradi was a Frooloo . Do you know the Frooloo family of Moogradi ? " <p> The boy looked out into the rain . The entire Frooloo family , a long time ago , had disappeared ; if the officer asking him so many questions was the famous desperado Raoul , he would know this . <p> The man took his hand from the boy 's shoulder and once again stood between the woman 's split legs . He regarded the woman 's not to come by way of this jurisdiction . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " My officers are much disturbed . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " It has occurred to them that you and these gringos may be spies . " <p> The boy regarded the officers in silence . They were at first few in number , now there were numerous , all assembled under the small protection of the rocky overhang , chewing on whatever dried meat or vine they had to chew upon , and jabberling softly among themselves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the puddle at his feet , and pitched a small stone out over the valley . <p> The woman had risen to her hands and knees . They watched her hold to that position ; she seemed unempowered to do more . One of her companions let out a helpless moan as water coursed about him and slid him another few inches out over the cliff . <p> " A Toodoo does not spy , " the boy said . <p> " No . He only journeys towards what does not exist . " <p> The officers under the small overhang had broken off twigs from a nearby bush , and were now comparing them for length . The longest was perhaps two inches . The shortest could barely be seen . <p> The man turned on his heels and made a gesture towards them , " How long before our unfortunate prisoners hurtle to their deaths ? " <p> The officers displayed their various sticks . They were jabbering and laughing among themselves . The rain had momentarily slackened ; it now drove down again in a renewed burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . <p> The boy touched the officer 's arm . <p> " They have a map , " he said . <p> " Oh ? " <p> " A map which purports to show where Kolooltopec may be found . " <p> The man considered this statement . He rubbed his eyes and wiped both hands across his face . The boy noticed that the skin backside solemnly for a while , before kneeling and doing something with the ropes binding her hands . Rainwater coursed down his face , which was without expression . <p> " No ? Then perhaps my dead officer lied . Perhaps he had never seen Moogradi . Or perhaps the Frooloos of Moogradi are also in journey towards Kolooltopec . " <p> The man smiled . The boy tried to smile back , but he was too tired . <p> The woman lifted her shoulders somewhat and covered her face with her hands . Then she slumped down again and lay motionless . <p> A number of the officers slung their rifles and threaded their way carefully through the underbrush and sat down out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy watched them remove some spit of stalk from their pockets and thoughtfully chew upon these . <p> The man leaned upon his rifle and with his free hand turned the woman 's head about so that she was suddenly looking up into his face and the rain . She gave a silent moan ; her face was slick with mud and ravaged by a terrible swelling . He lowered his face and said something to her . She keened softly and closed her eyes . <p> The boy crouched down , hands circling his knees . He was looking with fascination at the three prisoners . The isolated pools of water had now become one large pool of muddy , gushing water , eroding the soil and chewing away at the lip of this small plateau , with the result that the three bodies were ever so slowly sliding down the incline , their boots now all but touching the edge of the cliff . They would soon tumble to their deaths in the great valley below . <p> The man knelt by the boy , also absorbed in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boy . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Kolooltopec , which does not exist ? " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " How is it that a Toodoo boy from Moogradi has come to be in the company of these crazy people in journey towards Kolooltopec ? " <p> " I am their guide . " <p> " Then you are not the best of guides or you would have known on the man 's hands was deeply scarred and that none of his fingers were longer than his thumbs . They had been cut away , the boy thought , probably with an axe . <p> " ' Purports , ' " the man said . " I do not know this word . What does it mean , this ' purports , ' and how does it come to pass that a boy from Moogradi makes use of the unknown word ? " <p> " School , " the boy said . " I was a student . " <p> " Ah . So the famous Moogradi village now has a school ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished and the school was torched . " <p> The man nodded . <p> " And did your great village have a fine clinic where the sick could come ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Which was also torched ? So that now your clinic and school and the schoolteacher , along with the Frooloo family you have never heard of , is lost to the world ? Does not exist ? Like our fabled Kolooltopec ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " But your adventurers have a map , you say ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> A couple of the soldiers ventured out from their overhang and dragged the two male prisoners a few feet forward from the cliff edge . <p> " You have seen this map ? " <p> " Many times . They have studied it unceasingly . " <p> " ' Unceasingly ' ? " " Yes . " <p> " It this map a good map ? " <p> The boy shook his head . " It is a worthless map . It is a map to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map . " <p> " Of course . " <p> They sat in their crouch , side by side , for some while before saying anything further . <p> " Which of these fine prisoners possesses the valueless document ? " <p> The boy pointed at the woman . She sat folded over , her head at droop on her knees . <p> She had cropped her hair close to her skull the second day out from the village ; the boy had some of this woman 's shorn hair still in his pocket . <p> " Does this prisoner , who possesses the famous map , also possess a name ? " <p> " They call her Emma . " <p> " Emma . I have never known anyone purporting to possess this name . " <p> The boy shrugged . <p> " Has Emma been good to the guide from Moogradi ? " asked the man . He circled one hand lazily over his groin . The boy grinned . <p> " Unceasingly . " <p> The officers under the protection of the overhang laughed merrily . Some few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step out into the warm rain for a few minutes , wash themselves , and then step back into their drier environment . Then they would step out into the rain again and for a few brief seconds furiously scrub and flap their ragged shirts . The boy studied these half-naked officers . He could count their ribs . One had a filthy cloth wrapping his chest ; the blood flowed red for a second , then went pinkish in the rain , before the red stain showed again . Another of these officers was a boy not much older than himself . He tried catching this one 's eyes , although it was clear the young officer had no interest in one of his experience . Several of them were women . The soldiers now numbered a dozen or more , a fresh face frequently arriving , although the boy could not see how this was possible unless they had burrowed a tunnel somewhere through the mountain and its mouth was nearby . <p> " Where are these crazy people from ? " the man asked . <p> " America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . He seemed amused . <p> " I had a young cousin who went to live in the country of America . Perhaps I and these prisoners are related . " <p> The boy smiled halfheartedly . " I hope your cousin in America is well , " he said . <p> " I thank you for your good wishes . But I expect this young cousin is now dead . He returned home , you see . " <p> " It grieves me to hear it . " <p> " I thank you . Yes , he is dead . My village was not so fortunate as your Moogradi with its teacher and clinic and the vanished school . " <p> The boy shut his eyes . <p> " But I have my officers and it is not wise to dwell upon those sorrowful deaths . " <p> The boy was crying . But he reasoned that no one would notice in the falling rain . <p> The woman had moved again . She had crawled in the mud to a spot somewhat removed from her two companions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her muddy hands covering her head . <p> The rain had turned cold . The sky was darkening . <p> It seemed to the boy that there now were as many as twenty officers milling about the tiny encampment . <p> " These crazy people , " asked the man . " Do they have food ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Is it good ? " <p> " Yes . Although it is of a kind I have never tasted before . They call it hiking food . " <p> " Hiking food ? You are right . I have never heard of hiking food . " <p> The officers were busy under their little overhang . They were on their hands and knees working with knives and sticks and an assortment of other tools . They were enlarging their little pocket in the mountainside . <p> " Tell me this , " the officer said to the boy . " In your five days ' journey towards Kolooltopec did you come across soldiers wearing the uniform of our republic ? " <p> " Yes . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue when your prisoners showed them their documents , and after prolonged inquiry . " <p> " Because you were on your way to Kolooltopec , which does not exist . " <p> The boy shrugged . <p> " Which meant that our prisoners were not to be taken seriously ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Or perhaps your three friends are peacekeepers from the famous United Nations , and the soldiers of the republic did not wish to offend their benefactors . " <p> " I do not know . " <p> " And because the soldiers of the republic were given money . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And what was the view of the soldiers of the republic as to the merits of the boy from Moogradi ? " <p> " I do not know . " <p> " My officers have heard there are informers in Moogradi . Some , so it is reported , express sympathy for the cause of the soldiers of the republic , while others align themselves with our movement . The Frooloo family , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard whispers . " <p> " Did these soldiers of the republic harm you ? " <p> " Not excessively . " <p> " What does this mean , this ' not excessively ' ? " <p> " They twisted my arms . They beat me about the head . " <p> " But not excessively . " <p> " No . " <p> " Since I see no visible wounds . " <p> " Yes . No . " The boy was confused . <p> " No cigarettes to your skin . No finger in the electrical socket . No axe to your hand or your head in the vice . No threats to put the torch to the whole of your wonderful Moogradi as you and your family are asleep on your mats . " <p> " No . " <p> " Because you were the guide for these people from the country of America who are now my prisoners and not because you are a spy in the employment of these soldiers of the republic ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . The boy tumbled into the mud , and lay still until the man who said he was Raoul helped him to his feet . <p> " You will excuse him , " he said . " My officers are distrustful of boy guides from Moogradi . He thinks you have been making a count of our members . " <p> The boy looked at the coursing ground . His shoulders were shaking . <p> " How many would you estimate are among us ? " <p> " I do not know . " The boy took a deep sigh and squared his shoulders . He looked into his inquisitor 's eyes . " It was out of curiosity only . But your officers seem to come and go . " <p> The man smiled sadly . He lay his hand over the backside of the boy , and said , " Yes . Yes . I agree . They come and they go . " <p> " I am sorry , " the boy said . <p> " Yes , we are all sorry . " He held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lifted the boy 's head into the rain . " Look up there , " he said . <p> The boy squinted his eyes and looked up into the cold rain . The mountains here stretched another ten thousand feet , but the sky was all but black now and the boy could see nothing of that vast height in the blinding rain . <p> " We are as numerous as the raindrops , " the man said . " That is how many . " The man allowed him to lower his face , and affectionately tousled the boy 's hair . The officers wove in and out . The boy was now convinced they had burrowed some crawl space through the mountain . But it would have taken them many years to accomplish this ; perhaps the task was begun even before he was born . The war had been going on a long time . <p> The man and the boy watched as the two male prisoners rose and staggered over to the rocks and dropped down into a heap near where the woman was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man asked the boy . " We have not harmed them . " <p> The boy peered at his thin ankles puddled in the muddy , streaming water . " No , you did not harm them . But they did not believe it would be so difficult as this , reaching Kolootopec . " <p> " Then they are crazy . " <p> " Yes . They are crazy . " <p> The woman seemed to be trying to scramble away from the two men , but her feet kept sliding from beneath her as rainwater sluiced its trails down the mountain . There was no place she could go , in any event . <p> Some of the officers were still digging into the mountainside . Others were laboriously attempting to get a fire going beneath a teepee of small , smoking sticks erected within a ring of stones . <p> The boy found he had fallen asleep , because when he opened his eyes the man was shaking him . <p> " My prisoners whom you are guiding to Kolooltopec , do they have money ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do not know . They are very strange on the subject . " <p> " In what manner ? " <p> " They bargained long hours with my family before my fee could be settled . They feared they might be cheated . " <p> " What was the settlement , may I ask ? " <p> " My family received one thousand moolees . A second thousand is to be paid upon my safe return . " <p> The man 's face brightened . " Two thousand ? Two thousand moolees is very little . Such a sum , I believe , would amount to no more than ten or so of your friend Emma 's American dollars . " <p> " Yes . But since the Koo does not exist then the expedition to it is foolish and thus has no value . So my family did not wish to charge extravagantly for my services . " <p> " Agreed . But there is still the issue of your time and expertise . Do you know the word , ' expertise ' ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra remuneration to your family for the small informational services you are meant to provide the soldiers of the republic . " <p> " No . " <p> The man smiled and playfully ruffled the boy 's hair . The boy shivered . <p> " On the other hand , you are serving your explorers as guide through a terrain totally unknown to yourself . Do you agree ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " So the sum of two thousand moolees is perhaps fair . " <p> " Yes . Such was my family 's determination after long deliberation of the matter , and after much imbibing of the pulqoo . " <p> " Ah , the pulqoo ! Did your adventurers admire the pulqoo ? " <p> " They became very merry . They could not stand up . The woman said she would return once she found Kolooltopec , and marry any handsome man in my village who could provide her with an eternal flow of the pulqoo . " <p> " She said this ! " <p> " Many times . " <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiat wedge of slate over her head , this slate providing shelter of a sort , under which her downcast face was hidden by multiple curtains of rain and a fine mist now steaming up from the earth . <p> " Yes , many times , " the boy said . " But the next day she repented . " <p> He pulled the woman 's wet hair out from his pocket and showed it to this man who might or might not be the legendary figure Raoul . <p> The hair was examined at length although the man would not touch it . <p> " Did the soldiers of the republic do this to our Emma ? " <p> " No . She clipped the hair herself because of the heat . " <p> " It was not the best hair , to begin with . " <p> " No . It is not the best hair . " <p> Finally he was told to return the woman 's hair to his pocket , and the boy quickly complied . <p> " And our other prisoners , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They argued and shouted . They danced and sang . " <p> " As did your own people ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And how is it your poor family in the insolvent village of Moogradi chanced to have such a wealth of the wonderful pulqoo ? " <p> " The jugs had been hidden , along with my sisters , when the soldiers of the republic occupied our village . It did not take much pulqoo to arouse the enthusiasm of our distinguished visitors . " <p> " My officers would give much to have this pulqoo in front of them this minute . " <p> The officers who heard this left off their digging and fire building to shout out " Pulqoo , pulqoo , " while thrusting their arms time and time again into the air . <p> " But alas , " the man said . " Alas , the pulqoo is all hidden away in Moogradi , side by side with its young daughters . " <p> " Alas . " <p> The officers had succeeded in getting a fire going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke pummeling above the flames and vanishing moments later within the ceaseless rain . <p> " Excuse me , " the officer said . <p> The woman 's head was down between her bent knees , her shoulders scrunched . She looked up , startled , when his hands touched her . He said something to her , and the boy , incomprehensibly , heard her laugh . The man helped her to her feet and led her over to the fire . One of the many officers milling about there dislodged a large stone and rolled it up by the fire . The man seated her upon the stone and after a moment her face lifted and she held her hands up to the fire . Several officers thrust their little spits of food upon her , but this she refused . <p> The other two prisoners arose and staggered towards the assembly . <p> The man returned and stood by the boy , who had given up trying to follow the movements of the officers and could no longer even guess at their numbers . <p> " We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps then we will shoot them . " <p> " The Toodoo family thanks you in their behalf . " <p> " On the other hand , if my officers shoot them the Toodoo family of Moogradi will be denied their next one thousand moolees and our adventurers will never reach Kolooltopec . " <p> " They will not reach it in any case . " <p> The boy 's eyes snapped open . For a moment he had imagined he saw doors opening in the mountainside and a stream of officers , endless in number , entering and leaving . <p> The man knelt beside him . <p> " These soldiers of the republic , in their garrison at the headwaters , were they many ? " <p> " No more than fifty . " <p> " Well-armed ? " <p> " Yes . With heavy weapons , including artillery . Many trucks , and armored vehicles without number . " <p> " Yes . More vehicles than they have soldiers to fill them . But such vehicles can not scale these mountains . Are they well-fed ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hour . " <p> " Which cargo they will not distribute among the people for whom it is intended . Is this correct ? " <p> The boy spat into the mud at his feet . " These goods are stamped in what manner ? " <p> " The usual . " <p> The man was quiet for some time . <p> The boy heard some little noise from afar and thought he saw a trip of goats at graze beyond the clearing . <p> He closed his eyes , hugging himself against the rain . <p> It was a very cold rain now , and he could not stop his limbs from shaking ; his buttocks were all but numb in the icy , flowing water , and a wind was whipping the rain against his face . He had his shoulders turned towards the fire and he imagined he could feel some little heat against the skin . <p> " And what did these heros of the republic say to you of my officers ? " <p> " They were contemptuous . Raoul 's forces were puny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His officers were of diminished capacity , without weaponry , the daughters of rodents , and were at final rot in the jungle . The insurrection would soon be terminated , they said , and your heads afloat in the river . " <p> " Yes . Yet they are frightened and dare not venture outside their garrisons , except to pillage and burn innocent villages , and rape and maim our sisters . What is the news of the latest atrocity ? " <p> " We saw fresh burning along the river . The villagers at the headwaters spoke of many corpses . Some say it is the work of your officers . Most believe otherwise . " <p> The officer unslung his rifle , yanked back the bolt , and showed the boy his rifle 's empty chamber . He stroked the wet stock before returning the weapon to his shoulder . <p> " Lamentable , yes ? " he said . " But do not surmise from this deficiency that we are unempowered . " <p> The boy did not speak of that other matter of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Toodoo family of Moogradi : of the many villages , up and down river , largely deserted now . Of the great secret exodus of his people to a sanctuary high in these mountains . <p> " My teacher spoke of Raoul 's cause with much reverence . " <p> " He who has vanished . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And is likely rotting in the jungle . " <p> " Yes . Or his head afloat in the river . " <p> " Perhaps your scholar has found bliss in Kolooltopec . " <p> " That is doubtful . " <p> " I agree . That is all but impossible . But your friends , you say , have with them a map . " <p> " Yes . It is wrapped in skin inside the woman 's pocket . " <p> " In Emma 's pocket . And what is in the pockets of her companions ? Money ? Tobacco ? Beads ? The pulqoo ? " <p> " I do not know . They have a card . " <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " A card made of gold ? I do not believe it . For what purpose ? " <p> " I am uncertain . They took their gold card to the bank in Foolderoo and came out with a fistful of our moolees , one thousand of which they presented to my family . I saw this with my own eyes . " <p> " I must see this card of gold . " <p> " Of course . " <p> " And the map . " <p> " Naturally . " <p> " My officers are expert readers of maps . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And we know the country . " <p> " Precisely . " <p> " You do not think our presence would diminish your own guide 's assignment ? " <p> " Quite the contrary . " <p> " A thousand such maps distributed wisely along the river might prove profitable for those hidden away beside your pulqoo . " <p> " Yes . If Kolooltopec exists . " <p> " But it does not exist . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire has the map . " <p> " Yes . Perhaps we should join her . " <p> " If you are satisfied a boy from Moogradi deserves this honor . " <p> " I can not attest to the boy 's honor . But I will extend to you our welcome . " <p> " I am grateful . " <p> They could see steam rising from the flesh of the three outsiders , and their wet clothes smoking . Some few other fires were alight now and the officers , some thirty or more , huddled around these , on this craggy lip of mountain . <p> For a moment the rain thinned and the boy thought he saw a thousand faces strung out over the hillside , and fires from a string of other such encampments carved into the mountainside ; in these could be seen the stark faces of mothers nursing their babies , and old women tending the fire pots ; he could see bony children of his own age and younger at kneel upon the stone shelves , and goats , and pigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow eyes seated upon a bird cage . <p> But he blinked and shook his head and when his eyes cleared they had all vanished . There was only loud , coursing water , and great sheets of rain splattering like gunshots all about them . <p> The boy slumbered by the fire , his body at rest among the three adventurers for whom he was guide . He was thinking of the one thousand moolees paid and of the one thousand more his family in Moogradi would likely never receive , since Kolooltopec was only a figment of the crazy imagination . <p> He slept . Then it was morning , and blinding sunlight , and the earth already baking , and considerable activity in their encampment . <p> " Onwards , " the officers were shouting . " Onwards to Kolooltopec ! " <p> Up and down the mountainside came the same cry . " Onwards . Onwards to Kolooltopec ! " <p> <p> <p> By LEON ROOKE <p>
