Wars may come &; go , but the cannonading over the question whether there is or is not a U. S. school in art goes on forever . Meanwhile , art appreciation in the U. S. has come of age with a bang . In 1939 a barrage of art books has been aimed at the public taste . Biggest is Thomas Craven 's A Treasury of Art Masterpieces , * a portable gallery of 144 color reproductions ranging from Giotto to Grant Wood . Most aggressive is Peyton Boswell Jr .

Because it confines itself by its title , Modern American Painting , in its color reproductions , gives a vivid and telescopic view of the changing U. S. from 1738 to 1939 .
