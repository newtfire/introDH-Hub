T. Allan McArtor , the new F.A.A. Administrator , addressed more than 200 pilots at a meeting he hastily called as public misgivings over safety and discipline in the air rose after a jetliner ' s crash at Detroit Aug. 16 that left 156 people dead . " The tragic accident has reawakened all of us , " Mr. McArtor said . While he agreed with pilots who noted that the American commercial aviation record was the best in the world , he added : " Is the system as safe as we can make it ? No , I don ' t think it is . " Equally important as the record itself , he said , is the public ' s perception of " an erosion of safety. " // // ' The Routine Is the Enemy ' // Mr. McArtor ' s appeal came in the wake of the Detroit crash of a Northwest Airlines plane , a near miss involving a Delta Air Lines jet over the Atlantic and the close brush between a private plane and President Reagan ' s helicopter , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in office a month , said that in the past attention had focused largely on a pilot ' s ability to handle emergencies , but that he was now more worried " about the fourth landing of the day , at sunset with clear skies , a routine , no-sweat landing . " " The routine is the enemy . " Mr. McArtor said . Many of the chief pilots , who are corporate executives with responsibilities including pilot training , standards and peformance , agreed with Mr. McArtor ' s call for new ways to improve flight-crew safety practices . But privately , many also accused his agency of being stronger on rhetoric than on action . <> <> Human Factor in the Cockpit // " The agency has spent only a small percentage of the money required to move ahead in research and training on human performance problems , " said Capt . Henry Duffy , head of the Air Line Pilots Association , the pilots ' union. // Three years ago , there was wide agreement between the pilots ' group and the aviation agency on a $9. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human-factor problems that occur in the cockpit . But Captain Duffy said the program had never been developed. // Another commercial pilot , who asked not to be named , said : " No one wants to criticize McArtor because he ' s new and he appears to be sincere . But the bureaucracy does not have a great history of following through where it counts. " // Bill Hoover , president of the Air Transport Association , the airline industry group , said : " The wheels of bureacracy grind so slowly . The F.A.A. works in a very ponderous system. " // In the Detroit case , Federal investigators have determined that the aircraft ' s flaps , components of the wing that lift the plane off the runway at low airspeed , were improperly positioned for takeoff and that the pilot and crew did not verify the flap settings as required in a preflight check. // An automated signal that should have warned of the error apparently failed to sound as well . Investigators have not yet determined to what extent these factors may have been responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our nation is watching and they are concerned , " Mr. McArtor said . " We must recapture their confidence in the country ' s aviation system . " He said he was also worried that too many commercial pilots and air traffic controllers might lack adequate experience. // Over the last three years , Mr. McArtor said , air traffic has grown bv 50 percent but levels of experience have generally decreased . " That ' s a disturbing trend , " he said , " traffic up , experience down. " // Mr. McArtor questioned the traditional practice of judging a pilot by the number of hours he has flown . " For 50 years , flight hours has been a measure of proficiency , " he said . " Is that still valid ? I ' m not sure it is. " // The F.A.A. chief stressed that he was " not picking on the pilots , " but some of those attending the conference , billed by the agency as a " town meeting , " felt that the meeting inevitably focused undue attention on them. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , controllers , weather people and others , " Captain Duffy said . Mr. McArtor said he intended to do so , but that no such meetings had yet been scheduled. // Captain Duffy also called upon Mr. McArtor to " pledge to march into the halls of the Department of Transportation and Congress to get the funding , " needed for new research problems. // " Good intentions are not enough when it comes to safety , " Captain Duffy said , adding that as long ago as the early 1980 ' s , the F.A.A. had devised a plan to use human-factor research to deal with advanced cockpit technology , the transfer of information to flight crews and studies of pilot performance . But that plan , he said , has had to " go begging for money " despite the fact that " the Administration has been sitting on a $5. 6 billion surplus in the Aviation Trust Fund . " <> <> Re-Adapting Technology // The pilot said most pilots would welcome higher standards for qualification and more modern training techniques . " We know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " That ' s not the question . We need to know why they occur , and how to prevent them. " // He said that cockpit technology also needed to be re-adapted so that it better suited the way humans work , rather than trying to force humans to adapt to the demands of computers . " We have re-engineered the airplane , " he said , " but you can ' t redesign a human being. " // He and Mr. McArtor said they rejected the popular term " cockpit complacency " as an appropriate description of what may sometimes happen to pilots and crews who rely excessively on their computers to fly the aircraft. // Captain Duffy said pilots had to be trained on flight simulators that more closely approximated real situations , including distractions , annoyances and multiple problems . Such computerized training programs do exist , he said , but are expensive. // The success of today ' s meeting , several pilots said , will be judged less by what was said than by whether meaningful initiatives follow. // " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very open and candid discussion , " said Capt . Lloyd W. Barry , a senior vice president of United Airlines . " We ' re going to need other kinds of meetings to really get the work done. " // The airline industry , he said , was eager to cooperate with any measures that would promote safety or the perception of safety . " We have a vested interest in reacting and reacting rapidly , " he added. // Mr. McArtor promised that there would be additional " roll up the sleeves " meetings , but said that he considered it important that today ' s gathering not exclude the public from a discussion in which millions of Americans have a strong and legitmate interest. // He told the pilots that if aviation professionals do not put their own house in order , " nonprofessionals " in Congress are likely to attempt to do the job for them through legislation and increased regualtion. //
