Vice President Nixon . as noted elsewhere an this page . has begun to talk openly and frankly about new legislation to pat labor 12111011MS under closer Federal regulation Senator linowiand of California talks publicly not only about Federal legislation of a general nature but of stronger state laws to protect wage earners ' " right to work " without their being forced to join unions . Others in Congress of both parties ? Senator McClellan is a notable exampLe  --  are also beginning to speak less timidly of the kind of laws that the great national labor unions have fought so hard , and so successfully , for a generation . Just recently Senator Butler of Maryland added his voice to those who have been asking that labor unions , like other aggregations of economic power , be put under the restraint of the anti-trust laws . Now all of these people are politicians . That does not mean , as cynics would have it , that they are simply out to satisfy the populace ; both Mr. Nixon and Mr. El* lowland are national political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unpopular . But the business of any experienced political leader is to gauge the public 's feelings so that he may choose the best time for leading the public where it would like to go . It avails a leader nothing to look around and find no one is following him . A Senator Butler who does not come up for re-election until 1962 can get further in the vanguard of public sentiment , But Mr. Knowland is running right now for Governor of California and quite likely has one eye clacked on the White House . Mr. Nixon is also not without hope of being the Republican Presidential nominee in 1960 . Plainly , then , these men are sigleaning that they feel a change in the public 's attitude toward labor unions and the law . For at least a generation it has been a political cliche that labor unions were untouchable . Most politicians believed it ; labor leaders certainly did . it took all the skin and force of the late Senator Taft to get even the mild restraints of the Taft-Hartley Act on the lawbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and even so late as 19:36 the Democrats were pledging themselves to its extinction . We have never really believed in the myth . because we have never really believed that the American public believed that anyone , labor leader or other , should be beyond the law in wielding unchecked power . But a myth believed by enough people is almost as powerful as if it were true . So long as this one was accepted by the generality of political leaders , nothing could be done . The results we see all about 1.1% ; they need not be recounted in view of the exposures of the McClellan committee and the actual experience of union members that they too are victims of this power in the hands of their union bosses . Now the results , we think , are themselves destroying the myth . Mr. Nixon may be ahead of others within the Administration in challenging the **untouchability " of union political power , but as our Mr. Tenzer reported yesterday the Administration is bestirring itself , perhaps at Mr. Nixon 's prodding . New labor laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is time to return union power to the purview of the law for the good of the country . And judging by the sensitive antennae of these politicians , it 's a time when doing good for the country will come to the aid of both parties .
