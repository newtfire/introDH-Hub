The President was led to the platform last evening near the depot , around which over 5,000 people had gathered . After being introduced by Mayor Stone , he expressed his gratification at the welcome he had received from the grand State of Iowa , and remarked that welcome came from all political parties , and from every description and rank of life . " I am circumscribed , " said he , " as to topics on which I may talk . I can not discuss politics , the all-absorbing topic of the day , and you will pardon me if I refer to the fact that there was a time when it was somewhat doubtful which party would have received me most heartily in Burlington . To Democrats who , about three years ago , would have been glad to see me , I thank you for this greeting . To the Republicans who are now glad to see me , I thank you . I have a hobby , which I have talked on of late , that in this period of universal prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might inaugurate a new policy on one important subject . Iowa need be told as little as any State that knowledge is power . Where universal suffrage prevails there must be universal education . But why say . this , to Iowa ? Because this country is all tied together , and the ignorance of one section is detrimental or perhaps even dangerous to the others . There should be everywhere free schools that will fit every man to vote . Mere voters are simply powder and balls for demagogues . Let means of education be provided by the general Government . You say , why shall not Maine and Georgia take care of their own educational matters , and not put it on us . This has some force as an argument , but there is another side . There is much for the general Government to do before some of the States can educate themselves . The people who have never known the benefits of education are those who never will until it is brought to their doors . Some sections of the country never had any education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South the duty of citizenship , and we can not complete that great work until we give them the means of becoming as great as they may with education . If we would make reconstruction complete we must also give every Southern white the same means of becoming a power and not a machine . " The President closed amid hearty applause , and Gen. Sherman , who stood by , was introduced by the Mayor . In the course of his remarks , Gen. Sherman said : " Boys : There are some things above politics . The profession of war is one of them . I hope no soldier will be influenced in his vote simply because I vote one way or the other ! or because I hold certain opinions . " Pointing to a large American flag , he said : " Let us make that flag the emblem of all that is great , good , and glorious . " The presentation of Mrs. Hayes before the crowd aroused the heartiest enthusiasm . The party then withdrew to the train , which at once moved off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidential party arrived here last evening . The speeches made were brief , and when the train was once more under way the party retired for the night . OMAHA , Neb. , Sept. ** Haves and party arrived at Council Bluffs early this morning , and at once crossed the bridge to Omaha . Here the charge of the excursion passed from the hands of the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company to that of the Union Pacific Company , who will send them on by special train , starting about 4 o'clock this afternoon . There was no reception at Omaha , owing to the uncertainty as to what time the party would arrive . At the depot were ambulances from Fort Omaha , which transferred the guests through the streets , rendered almost impassable by mud , to the fort . A purely military reception was there given to the chief magistrate and commanding General , so there were no speeches , although lunch was served , affording a good opportunity , and many people from Omaha and vicinity had gathered in expectation of hearing them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the carriages with the party left the fort , the six Sioux prisoners confined at the fort for the murder of a herder were drawn up between guards and manacled . They looked upon the distinguished visitors with stolidity . The President rode on in advance and spent the remainder of the day with friends in the city . Secretary Ramsey joined the party here , and will make the Western trip with him . All are in excellent health and the best of spirits . The weather has been wet and rainy , but has cleared , and the prospects of a pleasant journey are good .
