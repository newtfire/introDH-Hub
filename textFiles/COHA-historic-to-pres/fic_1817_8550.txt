The author is indebted to one of the novels of Le Brun , for the ground-work of this little comedy . DRAMATIS PERSON . Philadelphia Count Almeyda Mr. Robertson Count Arandez Warren Carlos Wood Pacomo Jefferson Gusman Abercrombie Pedrillo Durang Herald Jackson Eugenia Mrs. Entwistle Beatrice Francis Flora Claude Ladies , knights , men-at-arms , pages , servants . SCENE  --  at the castle of count Almeyda in Catalonia , during the thirteenth century . Time  --  twenty-four hours . Main text ACT I. SCENE I  --  a thick wood . Carlos . Carlos ( entering ) Come along , Pacomo . Pacomo . Pacomo ( without ) Here I come , signor , as fast as the briers will permit me . ( Pacomo enters , dragging a large portmanteau ; he stops at the wing , looking ruefully around . ) No outlet yet , sir ? Car . Carlos None . Pac . Pacomo ( resting his portmanteau against a tree , and taking his seat upon it ) Why , then , sir , we might as well make up our minds to starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos This is a pleasant adventure ! Pac . Pacomo You think so ! Car . Carlos Comical and incomprehensible . Pac . Pacomo Very . ( rising , and coming forward ) The history of our rambles will be worth the reading , sir ; and , if ever I escape from this labyrinth , I mean to have it fairly written down , for the benefit of all valets who follow lords that run after ladies . Car . Carlos And how will you explain our last adventure , sirrah ? Pac . Pacomo Nay , sir , posterity must explain for itself . I shall simply relate , that your lordship , as usual , in pursuit of a woman , after tracing her from town to town , arrived yesterday at a certain dog of a village , where your mysterious nymph had promised you should find her . Car . Carlos But where I arrived only to be again disappointed . Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir ; but where you lost no time in seeking consolation in the smiles of a little wanton brunette of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appertain to a venerable inquisitor . I shall then set forth , how his reverence discovered your sacrilegious design to run away with his mistress : for which he humanely sentenced your worship , and your humble servant , to be roasted alive ; for the good of our souls , and the edification of the innocent rustics . Car . Carlos O , poor knave ! methinks I still behold thee preparing for the august ceremony ! Pac . Pacomo Now , in my opinion , sir , if I recollect right , there was dev'lish little ceremony in the case . I only know , that , at the moment when I expected to mount up in a blaze , like a bundle of faggots ,  --  or rather like a bunch of matches ,  --  or still more like a wisp of straw ,  --  or , indeed , most of all like a  --  Car . Carlos O , the devil take thy similitudes . Pac . Pacomo With all my heart , sir ; and the inquisitor 's too , if you have no objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a parcel of troopers ; and , in a twink , we are rescued , and placed in a litter . Off we go , like a thousand devils , and are jolted handsomely all night . About day-light , the litter suddenly stops . What next ? says your lordship .  --  I thrust out my head , to the damage of my ears , and behold  --  nobody , nobody at all !  --  The traces are cut ; the horses are gone , and so are the troopers ; and there sit my master and I  --  Car . Carlos And a most ludicrous figure we cut . Pac . Pacomo Remarkably amusing . And , as you observe , sir , it was vastly comical to ride , helterskelter , with a goblin guide and guard , the whole night , without sleep or supper . It may , moreover , be highly entertaining to you , to wander all day in a thicket , without breakfast ; and , above all , it must prove particularly diverting , in the end , to be devoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our throats cut , from ear to ear , by those compassionate gentlemen , the banditti . Car . Carlos Thou art a monstrous coward , Pacomo . Pac . Pacomo I believe I am , sir , now and then . I have my cold fits , like my betters . Car . Carlos But , sirrah , what cause for fear can you have now ? We are safe ; and have the world fairly before us . Pac . Pacomo Not very clearly , I conceive , sir . Before us ! I should like to know in which direction it lies ; I 'll trouble your lordship to point out a path to it . Look , sir ,  --  on every side brambles ; nothing but brambles . This makes good the proverb , sir  --  Grasp at a woman , and hold a nettle  --  Car . Carlos Peace , sirrah ; dare not , with profane tongue , utter aught against the dear , capricious , lovely , inconstant sex . Pac . Pacomo Egad , sir , your epithets are mingled like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together : but yet , all , they make but a bitter pill . Car . Carlos O woman ! object of all my wishes ! Pac . Pacomo Cause of all my scratches ! Car . Carlos Thy bright eyes may indeed wound  --  Pac . Pacomo And so indeed may thy long nails  --  Car . Carlos But how sweet the cure of thy balmy lips ! Pac . Pacomo Or thy snagged teeth . Car . Carlos O woman ! to thee I owe all my joys ! Pac . Pacomo And I all my cudgellings ! Are you done , sir ? Car . Carlos In that case , what has your wisdom to offer ? Pac . Pacomo This , sir : that , with so much devotion to those beautiful blunders of Nature , I am puzzled to know why , two years ago , you eloped from Saragossa , when your father sent for you home to be married to one of them . Car . Carlos You forget that he would n't condescend even to name the person to me ; she therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to my taste . Besides , the whimsical old gentleman told me very frankly , in his letter , that he meant to precede my nuptials with a year 's confinement , as a punishment for my sins , as he chose to term my peccadilloes at Saragossa . Pac . Pacomo Peccadilloes ! O. Lord ! Car . Carlos But . no : Love and Liberty was my motto ; with this I took the field ; and finding Saragossa too limited for my enterprise  --  Pac . Pacomo Or rather too hot to hold you  --  Car . Carlos I sahied forth a lover errant  --  Pac . Pacomo And I your faithful ' squire Car . Carlos And what part of Spain have we not traversed , boy , what adventures have we not achieved ? Pac . Pacomo That 's all very true , sir ; but , then , on the other hand , in most of these adventures , what has been my share of the sex , but vixen widows , sharp-clawed abigails , or heavy-handed duennas ? Then , for odd accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kicks and cuffs from man and mule ! what bruises and broken bones in leaping walls and windows ! Nay , but yesterday , was n't I half drowned in the river Norguerra , and more than three-quarters roasted by the cursed Inquisitors ? Car . Carlos But , in the latter affair , you know , I was your companion . Pac . Pacomo That was very consoling , sir . But , by St. Pacomo , who is my namesake , and patron to boot , it would have been , at best , but a scurvy thing , if we had been both burned to cinders ; bachelors as we are , too , from whose ashes no little phoenixes could arise . Car . Carlos A mournful reflection , Pacomo . Pac . Pacomo Is it not , sir ? and , after all ,  --  that we might defy these roastings and toastings , would n't it be a lesser evil  --  I just put the questtion , sir ,  --  not that I think of such a thing  --  Car . Carlos What thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  matrimony  --  There , sir , the murder 's out . Car . Carlos Pacomo , I believe you 're right . Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir ; for come the worst , you know , it would only be out of the fire into the frying-pan . Car . Carlos You are certainly right , Pacomo : and learn , for thy comfort , there is one woman in the world , who . I think , could fix thy master 's destiny . Pac . Pacomo Is there , indeed , sir ! and may I ask what part of the unworthy globe she honours by her presence ? Car . Carlos It was during a festival in the convent of the Ursulines at Barcelona , that I beheld , amidst the train , one whose beauty distinguished her among the beautiful :  --  the only female who ever inspired me with a real passion . Pac . Pacomo At Barcelona ! Why , look you , signor , how our fates jump ! it was at Barcelona that I first saw my little Flora ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . How could you leave the place , sir ? Car . Carlos How could I stay in it , you rascal ? You know I was forced to quit it hastily . Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir ; thanks to one of your peccadilloes , as you call them  --  so hastily , that I had not even time to take leave of my mild chambermaid . Car . Carlos We were fellow-sufferers , Pacomo ; for I saw my fair unknown no more . And this was the more mortifying , as , in our brief interview , the observant crowd prevented me from telling her my real name , and learning hers . Pac . Pacomo You did n't converse , then ? Car . Carlos Infinitely  --  with our eyes . Pac . Pacomo I know the language of yours pretty well on those occasions ; but , what did her eyes say , sir ? Car . Carlos Methought they said a thousand flattering things . I fancied , even , as she left the room , they asked me , modestly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the modest invitation ? Car . Carlos It was impossible . I think you recollect my anger and impatience on leaving the town ? Pac . Pacomo ( rubbing his back ) Perfectly , sir : I believe I may carry some marks of them . Car . Carlos From that time , my rambles became tasteless ; my adventures insipid ; the image of my lovely recluse haunted me incessantly ; and , trusting that the affair at Barcelona had been forgotten , I was actually returning thither , when I unfortunately encountered that mysterious beauty who led me , like a fool , half over Spain . Pac . Pacomo Like a fool , indeed . Car . Carlos But once more I am free ; and nothing shall again prevent me from flying to the convent of the Ursulines Pac . Pacomo Nothing , except another mysterious beauty unfortunately falls in your way . But , signor , if I understood you rightly , you mentioned a convent  --  do you forget the inquisitors ? O , sir , quit at least those infernal scorching adventures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember I am still called Almanzor . Who can this be ! Pac . Pacomo O , a cut-throat , of course  --  Another adventure for you . ( Pacomo skulks behind the tree ) Car . Carlos What are you doing there ? Pac . Pacomo Getting my arms , signor . ( fumbling at the portmanteau ) enter GUSMAN . Pac . Pacomo ( peeping ) What a bloody-looking fellow ! Car . Carlos Now , sir , what are you ! Gus . Gusman A man . Pac . Pacomo The bold ruffian ! Car . Carlos You are explicit . Whither do you go ? Gus . Gusman Home . Car . Carlos Right : I like you . Pac . Pacomo The devil you do ! Car . Carlos Where do you reside ? Gus . Gusman In the neighbourhood . Pac . Pacomo In some cavern . Car . Carlos What is your employment ? Gus . Gusman I serve my master . Pac . Pacomo Yes ; he cuts throats for his captain . Car . Carlos Who is your master ? Gus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering confidence , and about to come forward ) O , if that 's the case  --  Car . Carlos De Berga !  --  that title 's strange to me . Pac . Pacomo ( shrinking back ) The devil it is ! Gus . Gusman Very possibly , signor , for it has been unknown in Spain a long time . My master has but lately returned from the holy land . Pac . Pacomo Its only a harmless old man . ( coming a little forward ) Car . Carlos Is the count 's castle nigh ? Gus . Gusman The park gate is within a hundred paces . Pac . Pacomo ( coming boldly up ) Well , signor ; does the fellow answer straitly ? If not  --  ( flourishing his sword . ) Car . Carlos Stand aside , rascal . Has the count a wife ! Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) O , lord ! the old game ! Gus . Gusman No , signor ; his lady has been dead many years . Car . Carlos What family remains ,  --  a daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Gus . Gusman Yes , signor . Car . Carlos Young and handsome ? Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) Ahem ! ahem ! Gus . Gusman All Spain can not produce her fellow . Car . Carlos Enough ; take me to the castle : you must introduce me to the count . Gus . Gusman Pardon me , ' t is more than I dare . Car . Carlos Wherefore ? Gus . Gusman The lady Eugenia has been brought from the convent in which she was educated  --  Car . Carlos A convent ? where was it  --  in what town ? Gus . Gusman In Barcelona , signor . Car . Carlos The name of the convent ?  --  quick , quick ! Gus . Gusman It was the convent of the Ursulines . Car . Carlos ( aside ) She 's found ! ' t is she ! Eugenia is her name , you say ? lovely Eugenia !  --  charming Eugenia ! Gus . Gusman Yes , signor ; and , as I said , she has been lately brought home  --  Car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought home  --  Gus . Gusman To receive the nobleman who is daily expected  --  Car . Carlos What ! how ! receive whom ? Gus . Gusman The young nobleman  --  Car . Carlos What young nobleman ? Gus . Gusman Why the young nobleman who is to espouse her . Car . Carlos Espouse her , espouse Eugenia ! never , by heaven , never ! Who is this worthless fellow , this nobleman ? Gus . Gusman Nay . I can not tell that , signor : but , until he arrives , the count forbids all male visitors . Car . Carlos Positively ? Gus . Gusman Imperatively . Car . Carlos And can nothing induce you to afford me a few hours ' shelter in the castle ; in your own apartment , any where ? Pac . Pacomo Even in the pantry ? Gus . Gusman I dare not , signor . Car . Carlos On no account ? ( shewing a purse ) Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) Oho ! Gus . Gusman I am too well contented with my present master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacomo What a dev'lish odd old fellow ! when gold 's so scarce , too !  --  Car . Carlos Well , old gentleman , you will at least indulge my curiosity with a sight of your churlish castle  --  the exterior of it , I mean ? Gus . Gusman I think I might even show you to a lodge in the park ; where , I doubt not , my friend the keeper will admit you  --  Car . Carlos Excellent old man ! come , lead on ! Pac . Pacomo But . signor  --  Car . Carlos Away , fool . Pac . Pacomo ( going towards the portmanteau ) Another adventure  --  more bruises ! Car . Carlos But why do ye linger , my brisk fellow ? lead on ! Gus . Gusman I would first fain inquire the signor 's business in this part of the country . Car . Carlos You have a right to know .  --  My name is Almanzor  --  I am a kind of travelling  --  philosopher Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) A philosopher . Car . Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing for me.  --  I wish to live secluded from society , and came to your fine province here for the purpose . Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) . The name of which province he is yet to learn . Car . Carlos And now , as you 're satisfied  --  who and what I am  --  come along . Gus . Gusman ( moving very slowly ) Well now , who would have thought philosophers were so hasty  --  I always imagined they were more sedate , as it were  --  more slow and patient . Car . Carlos Damn it  --  I tell you I am patient , I am slow  --  so come along , my fine fellow . Gus . Gusman But , I thought  --  Car . Carlos O , confound your prosing  --  come along , I tell you . ( Carlos forces Gusman off ) Pac . Pacomo ( following , dragging the portmanteau ) Yes , poor Pacomo , you may wrap your mantle of endurance around you ; for a storm of blows is brewing ; my wounded bones tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II  --  a Gothic castle . A window opens upon a balcony , on each side of which is a tower with battlements ; a ditch in front , filled with water , over which a drawbridge , lowered . A large door of entrance to the castle . count ALMEYDA enters hastily , following a servant across the bridge . Alm . Count Almeyda Where is he ? where is my old friend . count ARANDEZ enters from the side . Ah ! welcome , and again welcome ; my old comrade . Ar . Count Arandez Thank you , Almeyda , thank you . Fy ! what a journey I 've had . O ' my conscience , I believe the only level piece of ground between our castles is this gravel walk of your 's , and that 's not much to boast of neither . Alm . Count Almeyda Why , in truth , a journey of twenty leagues at your years , my friend , is no trifle . Ar . Count Arandez Damn it , Almeyda , why are you always talking of my years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old humour , my choleric count . Well ; but how is my good lady , your countess ? and what saint am I to thank for this visit ? Ar . Count Arandez You may thank the devil , I think , who put it into the head of the old saint , my wife , to persuade me to the journey . I must needs ride twenty leagues to consult with you touching my runagate son ! did you ever hear such folly ? Alm . Count Almeyda I must acknowledge I do n't perceive the countess ' folly in this instance . Ar . Count Arandez No ? not when I told her that your letters on the subject convinced me that your head was , as usual , full of stupid schemes and plans , that were good for nothing ? Alm . Count Almeyda I am obliged to you . And so you told the countess I was a fool ? Ar . Count Arandez I did  --  nearly . Alm . Count Almeyda And you have no faith in my schemes ! Ar . Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Count Almeyda ( with extreme self complacency ) And now , Arandez , I have to inform you that I have brought back your son Ar . Count Arandez Almeyds ! do 's just  --  brought him back ? Alm . Count Almeyda Ay , and he is now here . Ar . Count Arandez Here ! O , my dear count , forgive me . Where , where is the  --  the ( changing his tone ) the graceles liberty , ha ! where is the dog ? Alm . Count Almeyda Be composed , count Ar . Count Arandez But , is the poor boy well ? ' t is five years since I have seen him ; he was then a lad ; he must be much changed ; I long to  --  to  --  to knock the villain down . Alm . Count Almeyda Arandez , recollect how much you have already suffered by indulging this temper . Do you forget that two years ago , when burning with desire to see your son , you drove him into banishment by a ridiculous threat of confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arandez Curse plans ! was n't I his father ? besides , he ought to have known that I would have pardoned  --  psha ! I mean , the prodigal ought to have confessed the justice of his punishment . Alm . Count Almeyda What , for a few errors of youth ! should you or I have done so , Arandez , when we served together , under the banners of Mars or Venus , indifferently , as the chance happened ? but to go on . Your son takes wing , you send various bands in pursuit ; they meet , a smart brush takes place , and your son escapes  --  Ar . Count Arandez Yes ; after maiming my servants ; that I will never forgive . Alm . Count Almeyda Yes , you will . Ar . Count Arandez Never . He should first have permitted himself to be taken . Alm . Count Almeyda Count , which of us two would have been tamely taken at the age of twenty ? would you ? Ar . Count Arandez ( warmly ) No . Alm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail ; at length I adopt one of a different kind . A young man may be led but not driven . You had sent a surly trooper after him ; I , on the contrary dispatched a pretty girl . Ar . Count Arandez The devil you did ! and who , pray ? not your daughter ? Alm . Count Almeyda Hardly that . You recollect Olivia , my late countess ' woman ? Ar . Count Arandez Recollect her ! an artful , arrant  --  and you actually send that hussey to the man you intend for your daughter 's husband ? Alm . Count Almeyda Precisely . Ar . Count Arandez You amaze me . You corrupt my son , then , in order to bring him back to his duty ; and send him a coquette to fall in love with , that he may marry your daughter . This is scheming with a vengeance . Alm . Count Almeyda You are mistaken , Arandez ; do but listen . I knew that nothing but beauty could entice your son hither , and that was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was secure in Olivia 's prudence . Besides , Carlos had never seen my daughter . Nay , if he had even been betrothed , can you , my rigid moralist , call to mind no instance in which the fancy has pursued a transient object while the heart has held us faith ? Ar . Count Arandez Almeyda , you talk like a libertine . Alm . Count Almeyda I defend no principle , I ask a question . Ar . Count Arandez And I answer , no . Alm . Count Almeyda No ! not in our first campaign ?  --  you were married too , I believe , at the time . Do you remember nothing of a certain black-eyed widow  --  Clara Nunez , I think they called her ? ' t was in that little town in Castile  --  plague on the name  --  there , where we first heard of the moors having re-entered Valencia  --  you recollect this ? Ar . Count Arandez Psha ! no  --  yes . No matter ; go on with your story . What did this black-eyed widow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Alm . Count Almeyda She fell in with him most opportunely , and played her part admirably . Excited his curiosity , but kept him at arms ' length ; and , finally , allured him in pursuit of her to the next village . Ar . Count Arandez The puppy ! well ? Alm . Count Almeyda She gave me immediate intelligence , and I yesterday hastened thither , disguished , with my followers . I had already laid my plans , and an accident furthered their execution . In conclusion , I this morning left your son in the wood adjoining my park . Ar . Count Arandez And why there ? zounds ! he may escape again . Alm . Count Almeyda That impossible ; the wood is surrounded by my spies . ' T is true , I hoped he would have found his way to my park-gate by this ; but , to make all sure , I have sent my old Gusman to bring him hither by a manoeuvre . Ar . Count Arandez A manoeuvre ! I shall lose him yet . Alm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ar . Count Arandez But where 's my son ? Alm . Count Almeyda You 're so impatient . enter Gusman . Gusman Now , Gusman , where is he ? Gus . Gusman In the lodge , signor . Alm . Count Almeyda ( to Arandez ) There . Ar . Count Arandez And what account does the rascal give of himself ? Gus . Gusman He says he is a philosopher , who flies from society . Ar . Count Arandez A philosopher ! and how does the scoundrel behave ? Gus . Gusman He sings , dances , and talks about my young lady . Alm . Count Almeyda Then he already knows you have a young lady ? Gus . Gusman ' T was almost the first question he asked me , whether your lordship had n't a daughter . Ar . Count Arandez The reprobate ! Alm . Count Almeyda And you told him  --  Gus . Gusman The truth , signor , that your lordship had ; and that she was the most charming young lady in all Spain . Alm . Count Almeyda And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gusman Yes , signor . Alm . Count Almeyda Well . Gus . Gusman He swore the young nobleman should not have her . Ar . Count Arandez The ruffian ! Gus . Gusman And offered to bribe me to steal him into the castle . Ar . Count Arandez The incendiary ! Alm . Count Almeyda Bravo , bravo ! I shall have a dashing son-in-law . Gus . Gusman From his words , signor , I should judge he had already seen madam Eugenia . Alm . Count Almeyda How , Gusman , when ? where ? Gus . Gusman At her convent , signor . He speaks in raptures of a young lady whom he saw there . Alm . Count Almeyda This is beyond my hopes  --  what say you to that , Arandez ? Ar . Count Arandez I say that he is likely to have fallen in love with the whole sisterhood , from the abbess down . Alm . Count Almeyda Well , go , good Gusman . Enter the castle , and proceed with our arrangements . Gus . Gusman The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my lady . exit Gusman Alm . Count Almeyda Say you so , honest Gusman ? then we had best retire , count . Ar . Count Arandez Am I to know the meaning of all this ? more schemes , I suppose . Alm . Count Almeyda Check your choler , my friend . Do n't you perceive my design ? your son loves to penetrate mystery and overcome difficulty ; I offer him both . If Eugenia and he have met before , they already love ; and , at any rate , they must , when they see each other . Then come prayers and attempts on his part ; sighs and tears on hers ; frowns and repulses on mine . Ar . Count Arandez Your daughter , then , is not in your famous plot ? Alm . Count Almeyda No ; her candour might betray us before we had securely fixed this volatile boy . Gusman is my only confidant . But come , I must now set my old dragoness , Beatrice , to watch the fruit . I foresee he 'll overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases with opposition . O ! it 's a fine plot ! Ar . Count Arandez Yes , and it will fail as all your plots do . Alm . Count Almeyda All my plots do ! but you 're so obstinate . Ar . Count Arandez And you 're so confident . Alm . Count Almeyda Well , come into the castle . You must disguise yourself ; and you shall see your son in all his brilliancy . Ar . Count Arandez I think I should'nt like to meet him . It strikes me that I should be sorry to have his murder on my hands . Alm . Count Almeyda Haste , haste , I think I perceive him  --  Ar . Count Arandez ( eagerly ) Where , where ! just let me have one look at the dear  --  damn 'd , confounded scoundrel.  --  Curse it , Almeyda , why do n't you come along . exeunt enter Carlos , stealing in .

( the archer adjusts his arrow , and seems about to shoot , when Eugenia rushes out in the balcony , with a shriek , and forbids it ; the archer retires ) ' T is she , by Heaven ! ( he approaches the bridge , still gazing at her ; when on the bridge , he stops , seeing her about to retire ) Fair creature , lovely Eugenia  --  ( she waves him to go ) I obey , lady , but o ! after so long a separation , surely , I may dare to ask one short , one fleeting moment ,  --  ( she seems about to leave the balcony ) Ah ! you are offended at my presumption . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vows . O Eugenia ! my tongue does but repeat what my eyes must have told you when I first beheld you ; what my heart has never ceased to feel . I love you , with the most unalterable passion . Nor let this abrupt declaration shock your delicate soul . Your father destines you to another ; and love , conscious of its purity , and urged by peril , may forget the slow formalities of respect .  --  You will not speak :  --  at least deign to credit me when I inform you , that my rank is equal to my rival 's , my name  --  enter PACOMO , running , with the fragment of a fowl ; as he speaks , Eugenia disappears hastily . Pac . Pacomo Don Almanzor , don Almanzor . Car . Carlos She 's gone ! ( rushing to Pacomo ) Perish , caitiff ! Pac . Pacomo ( dropping his fowl in amaze ) Why , signor  --  o lord , signor ! Take care  --  my throat 's full of chicken . Car . Carlos ( still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pacomo Lord , sir  --  I came to tell you that dinner was ready  --  I thought to rejoice you . Car . Carlos Dinner , ideot ! ( throws Pacomo from him ) What shall I do ! ( walking about ) She must be mine . Yes ; I am convinced that If Eugenia were my wife , my life would pass in still and tranquil content . ( stops ) And for that I was born :  --  I was intended for quiet  --  ( starting suddenly ) By Heaven ! I 'll enter the castle this moment  --  Who the devil 's this ! ( rushing toward the bridge ; but stopping suddenly , as Beatrice appears at the door . After a short pause , he speaks ) Pacomo ! Pac . Pacomo ( who had remained terrified ) Yes , sir . Car . Carlos Do you see that old woman ? Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir . Car . Carlos You must make love to her . Pac . Pacomo I , sir ? Car . Carlos You  --  while I enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it 's an ancient duenna ! Car . Carlos No words , sirrah ; begone . Pac . Pacomo Saint Pacomo , protect your namesake ! ( Pacomo passes the bridge , followed by Carlos ; and approaches Beatrice grotesquely . Carlos attempts to pass . Beatrice , who prevents him . Pacomo draws her towards him , while Carlos enters the castle . Beatrice , attempting to follow , is stopped by Pacomo , who makes love ludicrously . She flies at him ; he takes her up in his arms , and brings her across the bridge ; she beating him , he sets her down . ) Bea . Beatrice ( choaked with rage ) You ruffian ! Pac . Pacomo ( drawing off , bowing ) Smooth those wrinkles , most venerable duenna . Bea . Beatrice ( following him about ) Wrinkles , wretch ! venerable , monster ! Pac .

Pacomo Ay , he said he would , this moment ; and I never doubt his word . Bea . Beatrice You 'll both be hanged first , sirrah . enter from the castle , CARLOS , urged by count ALMEYDA ; count ARANDEZ follows , disguised . Several servants behind . Alm . Count Almeyda Come on , don Almanzor . Bea . Beatrice My lord , I demand vengeance on this villain . Alm . Count Almeyda Presently , Beatrice . Come sir ; we all have our habits : ' t is mine to breathe the air after dinner : we 'll take a promenade in the park . Car . Carlos But , sir , I have not yet dined , and although I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my account ; I think a guest fatigued by travel might have been permitted to remain in the castle . Ar . Count Arandez ( aside to Almeyda ) shall I stangle the impudent puppy ? Alm . Count Almeyda No ; I like his impudence . ( To Carlos ) You would , perhaps , have conceived me more polite , if I had left you with my daughter . Car . Carlos I ca n't deny it . Alm . Count Almeyda No , surely It appeard to me that you accosted her like an old acquaintance . Has she the honour to be known to you ? Car . Carlos I had the happiness of seeing her at the Ursuline convent at Barcelona . Alm . Count Almeyda Well , sir , you will , however excuse me if I require some knowledge of those I leave with my daughter ; and it has somehow occurred to me that the ancient family of Almanzor , to which you say you belong , does not exist in Spain : Almanzor is not even a Spanish name . Pac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , what would come of that cursed name . Ar . Count Arandez ( aside to Almeyda ) How like a hang-dog he looks ? Bea . Beatrice I knew they were rogues , my lord , by their appearance ; and I hope you 'll have them both hanged . Alm . Count Almeyda I 'll speak to you within , Beatrice : withdraw . ( Beatrice , in pique , butles off , her hands on her sides ; as she passes Pacomo , he bows , she slaps him ) Alm . Count Almeyda Come , come Almanzor , I have been too young myself not to have some indulgence for youth , all I ask in return is , that you will quit the vicinity of my castle . My daughter is engaged : and as you are truly a handsome cavalier  --  Car . Carlos O , a truce to your compliments , my lord . Alm . Count Almeyda You might be dangerous . In a word , if a gentleman who appears to be of some rank , should forget what is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repent his temerity . Car . Carlos ( a little roused ) Signor , I never submit to menaces . Alm . Count Almeyda Nor I to offence persisted in . Car . Carlos Any other than the father of Eugenia should account to me for this language . ( Almeyda turns to go ) Stay , my lord , and forgive my petulance . I confess the name of Almanzor is assumed : but I am a gentleman ; I adore your daughter  --  Alm . Count Almeyda And your real name is  --  Car . Carlos ( aside ) No ; that were hazarding too much : to rid himself of me , he might send word to my father . Ara . Count Arandez ( in a feigned voice ) You perceive , signor , the gentleman is dumb : no doubt he is ashamed of his name . Car . Carlos ( turning fiercely upon him ) . And who are you that dare make that presumptuous supposition ? Ah ! perhaps the friend , the emissary of my rival  --  perhaps my rival himself :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , as a Spanish knight , to grant me the combat with the man who has insulted me : there 's my glove . ( Throws down his glove at Arandez feet ; Arandez laughs ) Laught at ! never will I submit to such indignity ! ( the servants surround Carlos . Almeyda waves them off ) Alm . Count Almeyda Young signor , your courage is ill-timed . Give me your sword . Car . Carlos I surrender it to the father of Eugenia. ( gives his sword ) Alm . Count Almeyda By my knighthood , he 's a fine fellow . ( aside ) Here , young gentleman , I restore your sword . No doubt you know how to use it ; but draw it in a better quarrel . Farewell : I almost regret that ' t is not possible we can be relations . ( Almeyda and Arandez exeunt across the bridge . Servants follow ) Car . Carlos My lord , it is very possible . Look to your daughter ; for by heaven , I 'll have her , or perish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laugh , and the bridge is raised ) Confusion ! the bridge raised ! what 's to be done ! ( walks about , examining the castle . Stops suddenly ) Pacomo ! Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir . Car . Carlos You can swim ? Pac . Pacomo Sir ! Car . Carlos You can swim across this ditch ? Pac . Pacomo ( shivering ) Santa Martha ! what ; in this weather , sir ! Car . Carlos ( after some thought ) well then : go to the lodge , and bring hither two hatchets . Pac . Pacomo Two hatchets , sir ? Car . Carlos Two hatchets , I tell you : we must cut down one of those trees for a bridge . Pac . Pacomo O , lord , sir ; would you go to cut down the count 's tree ? Car . Carlos His tree ! ay ; his whole park . Pac . Pacomo But lord , sir , we could never get a tree across the ditch sufficiently large . Car . Carlos No ; why then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An excellent though : I 'll enter the fortress la militaire . The part keeper has an ass ? Pac . Pacomo I think so . Car . Carlos That 's convenient . Pac . Pacomo Very . Car . Carlos You must borrow it of him ; procure also , two hatchets . The time between this and midnight must be employed in making fascines , and bringing them to the spot . I 'll cross the fosse like a Csar . Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) And be knocked in the head like a dog . But , signor , when across , how get into the castle ? Car . Carlos That 's true . ( examines ) Pacomo , do you not see yon little window ? Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir ; and I see two iron bars across it . Car . Carlos You must , therefore , furnish yourself with a crowbar . Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir . ( going ) Car . Carlos Stop . The window , no doubt , opens into the vaults ; you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrench away ; and fasten our ladder to the other . Go , Pacomo . Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir . Car . Carlos Stay . The vaults will be dark ; you must fetch a lanthorn  --  a dark lanthorn . Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir . Car . Carlos Stop . What else ? ( walks , ruminating ) Pac . Pacomo Lanthorn , rope , crow-bar , ass  --  Car . Carlos Yet should I so abruptly meet Eugenia  --  No ; I must not alarm her . Could I but prepare her , without , however , telling my exact design : how shall I convey a letter ! O , Venus for thy dove ! or rather Jove , for thy eagle ! his rapid pinion would suit me best : like an arrow I would send him  --  an arrow ! the very thing : Pacomo ! Pac . Pacomo Sir ! Car . Carlos Run , fly  --  Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir . ( going ) Car . Carlos Stay , fool . Hasten to the lodge ; bring me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his ass , sir ? ( going ) Car . Carlos No , rascal . Pac . Pacomo Yes , sir . exit , running Car . Carlos In the mean time , out , vellum : and pencil , be true to thy master 's feelings . ( takes out pencil and vellum  --  kneels on one knee , and writes ) There . But lest it should miscarry , no name . re-enter PACOMO , with bow and arrows . Car . Carlos Now , Pacomo , away , and prepare for our attack . Pac . Pacomo ( as he goes ) Crow-bar  --  rope  --  lanthorn  --  hatchet  --  ass  --  exit Car . Carlos ( kneeling and fixing the letter to the arrow ) My skill in archery will serve me here , better than in slaying men . I can at least lodge my arrow on the balcony . Nay , if the window were but open , I could send it into the very chamber ( as he looks up the window opens ) Ah ! the window opens ! she sees my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how superior art thou to our dull sex !  --  ( adjusting his arrow ) Now , Cupid , ' t is in thy war !

Yes ! she has received my letter , and will therefore receive me . Huzza ! the day 's mine . exit , gaily ACT II . SCENE I  --  Eugenia 's apartment ; window , with blinds , on the flat . EUGENIA seated at a table , reading a letter . FLORA waiting . A book lying on the table . Eug . Eugenia What can be the design he alludes to , Flora ? Flo . Flora To enter the castle , without doubt , madam : or , how else could he throw himself at your feet , as he promises ? Eug . Eugenia Surely he would not dare  --  Flo . Flora O , madam , you do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I shall never forgive you for opening the window to admit his letter . It must seem like improper encouragement on my part : I was very angry at it . Flo . Flora Why yes , madam ; you appeared so angry at receiving the letter , that I expected you would throw it out of the window again  --  instead of poring over it for hours , as if you were decyphering a moorish inscription . Eug . Eugenia Teasing creature , there ! will that satisfy you ( throwing the letter on the table , and rising ) Flo . Flora But should your father come in  --  Eug . Eugenia True : he must not see it . ( putting it into her bosom ) Flo . Flora Ah , madam ; beware . In your bosom ? Love 's a subtle urchin : who knows but he may glide from the letter into your heart ? Eug . Eugenia To tell you the truth , Flora  --  ( sighing ) Flor . Flora Out with it , madam . Eug . Eugenia And yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or can easily guess . I can not think but with horror of the promise I gave my father . Flo . Flora To marry a man you had never seen ! The count must release you from it : you were but a child when you gave it ; and could n't know the difference in men . They dare n't shew you your intended husband ; and good reason too ; for I 'll be sworn he 's a mere fright ; while this young cavalier  --  Eug . Eugenia Is suspected by my father to be an impostor . Flor . Flora Old men are apt to be suspicious without cause . Eug . Eugenia And yet I am forced to acknowledge , that there is the appearance of something equivocal in his character . He has confessed to my father that his name of Almanzor is assumed : and even his letter , frank and sincere as it seems , has yet no signature . Flor . Flora But he tells you that he has powerful motives for concealing his name ; and declares that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flora , whence is this confidence of yours in a stranger . You have discovered , I think you said , an old acquaintance in his follower ? Flor . Flora Yes , ma'am  --  at the first glance through the window , as your ladyship discovered another in his master . I knew poor Pacomo at Barcelona , before I had the honour to serve you : and it is from his report that I speak with so much confidence of Almanzor . Eug . Eugenia And what has he made the silly girl believe ?  --  let us hear , Flora . Flor . Flora ( aside ) For the hundredth time .  --  Why , madam , he has often assured me that his master was heir to one of the noblest families in Spain ;  --  that he was generous , bold , sensible , gay , and good natured : in short , that he had no fault except , perhaps , too general a penchant for our sex  --  Nay , madam , why look grave ? this was before he saw you ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugenia Psha ! Flora , you know I detest flattery . ( walking involuntarily to her glass ) Flo . Flora Hark ! I think I hear a noise . ( runs to the window ) Eug . Eugenia Do n't for the world open the window . Flo . Flora Then you do suppose it possible he may be under it ? Just a little  --  little peep , madam . ( partially opening the window ) Ay ; as I suspected ; there they are , filling up the ditch . I believe . What an heroic lover is yours , madam . My life o n't , you see him to-night . Eug . Eugenia ( alarmed ) Do you really think so . Flo . Flora And hope so too ; and could find in my heart to believe you do not very  --  very much fear it . Eug . Eugenia You are mistaken ; the idea terrifies me . The act is imprudent  --  criminal . Rash young man , how cruel is the duty you have forced upon me ! But whatever pain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flo . Flora Inform the count , madam ! Eug . Eugenia Undoubtedly : he is the most indulgent of fathers ; and shall not blush for the daughter he loves and confides in. ( going , is met by the count ; she stops , confused ) Alm . Count Almeyda I tremble at the trial her virtue must undergo . ( aside ) Whither were you going , my love ? Eug . Eugenia To seek you , my dear father . Alm . Count Almeyda I thank you . I came to enquire after your health ; for not seeing you since dinner , I feared you were ill : but I perceive ( pointing to the book ) you have been reading . Eug . Eugenia Yes , sir , I have been  --  reading . Alm . Count Almeyda The book I put into your hands  --  I hope you found it interesting ? Eug . Eugenia Yes , sir  --  that is  --  so much of it as I have read . Alm . Count Almeyda ( aside ) The dullest volume in my library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You are ill ; your face is flushed  --  you tremble ! ( taking her hand ) Eug . Eugenia No , my father  --  I believe  --  I am very well . Alm . Count Almeyda I am rejoiced to hear it ; for I wish to have a little grave discourse with you . Flora , leave us . Flo . Flora ( aside , going ) Yes ; but I wo n't go far , old gentleman . exit Alm . Count Almeyda ( aside ) If she but gives me her confidence , I 'm happy ( sets chairs ) Come , my love , be seated . Eug . Eugenia ( aside ) O ! how shall I ever tell him ! Alm . Count Almeyda Eugenia , some time since , I think I mentioned to thee , though not indeed with much formality , my intention of uniting thee to the son of one of my earliest and dearest friends . Eug . Eugenia Yes , sir ; I think recollect you did ; but , as you observe , so long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Almeyda Not precisely that . But I received your promise , and forbore to press the subject . Since , however , this young Almanzor has been near my castle , I have felt , I know not what apprehensions . Eug . Eugenia ( aside ) What will this lead to ? Alm . Count Almeyda I have reflected , that as you have not yet seen your intended husband , you can be governed only by a cold sense of duty  --  Eug . Eugenia Ah , sir ! do not call it a cold sense of duty . Alm . Count Almeyda At least , cold when compared to another feeling , which even consumes duty , if duty oppose it . Eug . Eugenia What does my father mean ? Alm . Count Almeyda ( aside ) Hum !  --  I say , I have feared lest on a heart , tender and susceptible as thine , an impression possibly might be made by the arts of this adventurer , who styles himself Almanzor . Eug . Eugenia My father then has discovered  --  has ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Count Almeyda Not ascertained  --  but I have good reason to suspect it . Eug . Eugenia With an air so distinguished  --  a manner so frank  --  Alm . Count Almeyda There lies the danger .  --  But an adventurer only , could conceal his name . Eug . Eugenia But may not this  --  young man  --  have powerful reasons  --  motives  --  ? Alm . Count Almeyda I would willingly believe so , but  --  Eug . Eugenia ( sighing ) He looks so like a gentleman . Alm . Count Almeyda Impostors often do . Secluded as you have been in your convent , Eugenia , you can have seen but little of mankind ; and I can readily suppose , that this Almanzor may have appeared to you a very remarkable person . Eug . Eugenia O , sir , we were not always entirely secluded . In time of festival , our convent was often crowded with the gentry of Barcelona . Alm . Count Almeyda But , in opinion , there was no other to be compared to him ? Eug . Eugenia I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almeyda This is as I suspected .  --  You deem him then a superior being , because you have not yet beheld  --  his equal ? ( aside ) Where the deuce am I getting to ? Eug . Eugenia Is not that natural ? Alm . Count Almeyda Hum !  --  Indubitably but when you shall mingle with the world  --  Eug . Eugenia Are men like him , then , common in the world ? Alm . Count Almeyda Why , his figure , perhaps , is uncommonly fine ; his eyes , indeed his whole countenance , replete with intelligence ; he has , besides , as I discovered in our conversations , a cultivated mind ; but above all he possesses that quick sense of honour , which , as a soldier , I can not but admire ; and a grace , I may say , a dignity of deportment , which only nobility of soul ought to give . Eug . Eugenia ( warmly ) And can such a man be an adventurer ? Alm . Count Almeyda I hope not ; I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make us cautious ; for , whatever he be , he loves you , Eugenia . Eug . Eugenia Ah , sir !  --  Alm . Count Almeyda In that he is no impostor . An adventurer could not feign a passion such as he exhibits ,  --  a passion which , overcoming his prudence , tends even to defeat his plans . Eug . Eugenia Is my father aware that his words seem to prove that the conduct of this young man  --  is evidence of  --  Alm . Count Almeyda His truth  --  his honour ! Well , it may be so ; he may possess rank and character . But , should my suspicions be well grounded , what could compensate us , if , unhappily , you should yield your heart to an unworthy object !  --  But that can not be , my daughter will shun the danger  --  Eug . Eugenia Ah ! my father ! Alm . Count Almeyda I give you up your unconditional engagement , and will never require you to marry against your wishes . In return , I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eug . Eugenia O , never , never : I promise I never will . Accept my entire confidence . Let my confusion speak for me  --  my bosom has already , I fear  --  ( hides her face on his neck ) Alm . Count Almeyda Is it possible ! Eug . Eugenia But I will forget ,  --  if I can ,  --  all you forbid me to remember . There , sir  --  I will withhold nothing . ( giving him the letter ) Alm . Count Almeyda Incomparable girl ! ( aside ) How 's this  --  a design  --  ! what to effect ? Eug . Eugenia I fear , to enter the castle  --  to-night . Alm . Count Almeyda Indeed ! I shall receive the honour of his visit as I ought . ( Eugenia sinks into a chair ) ( aside ) Poor girl ! I am almost tempted to tell her all ;  --  but , no , that might ruin my whole scheme .  --  Be composed , Eugenia ; you have performed your duty ; and you have my blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confided in me ; it is for me he is thus criminal . Alm . Count Almeyda Then , for your sake , he shall be pardoned .  --  Come , Eugenia ; give me your company at supper : I will not detain you long . Almanzor shall not be harmed . Come ; cheerly , my girl : all this may yet end in happiness . Eug . Eugenia How , sir ! Alm . Count Almeyda ( aside ) I shall betray myself  --  You will , however , change your chamber for the night Eug . Eugenia Yes , sir . Alm . Count Almeyda ( taking her hand ) Come , my love .

PACOMO is discovered cautiously descending the extremity of the vault , by a rope , which is fastened above ; in his girdle is a darklanthorn . CARLOS stands below , holding a crow-bar . Car .

We are now , Pacomo , like that famous general who burnt his ships on the enemy 's coast ; determined to conquer or perish . Pac . Pacomo That general was not over wise , sir ; or he would have left open a back-door , in case of accident . Car . Carlos How fine and dark ! Pac . Pacomo And what a wholesome humidity hangs on the walls ! Car . Carlos What a charming place ! Pac . Pacomo Yes ; to catch one 's death in.

But if we run our vessel upon the rocks , you may retreat thither ; and , like the foolish mariner , perish with your mouth at the cask . Pac . Pacomo Well , sir , there 's some comfort in that . Car . Carlos There appears no chance of choosing our way while the doors are closed : we must open them . Pac .

Count Almeyda They are , nevertheless , consecrated by time , and consequently demanded by opinion , who is governor of the social world . Eug . Eugenia To this chimera , then , you would sacrifice the honour of an unfortunate youth , whose sole fault is  --  Alm . Count Almeyda Love , you would say .

This is the identical accusation made in the famous affair of Peter of Provence and the beautiful Maguelona : and it will suit our case exactly , by only changing a few words . Ay , ay ! let me alone for an accuser : I 'll warrant I scourage my gentleman . ( going , returns ) But what , my lord , what shall we do with his insolent valet ? Alm .

Beatrice You ! the advocate ! against all rule ! You 'd better let me do it . Bea . Beatrice Be satisfied ; I shall do it myself . Bea . Beatrice O , very well , my lord . Only let your questions be difficult enough . Alm . Count Almeyda Certainly  --  Leave me . Bea . Beatrice Very difficult . If you doubt yours , let me recommend to you the proceedings of the court held at Avignon , in the case of Godfrey the Fiery , or of the bold Guiscard  --  I have them both by heart . Alm .

Count Almeyda Now , my dear count , now approaches the hour which is at once to end our cares and display my genius for manoeuvring . Ar . Count Arandez Well , Almeyda , you have conducted things accordings to your own fancy But , in the first place , I have no opinion of your genius for any thing , and , secondly , if I had had my way , the dog should have been either married or hanged long ago .

You know there 's no appeal from the decision of a Court of Love ? Alm . Count Almeyda Well . Ar . Count Arandez And that this court is composed of silly , resentful , not-to-be-depended upon creatures  --  in short , of women ! Alm . Count Almeyda Well . Ar . Count Arandez And that if a man be convicted of having committed an offence against the laws of chivalry  --  such for instances as kissing a pretty girl too close  --  he is stricken from the roll of knighthood ? Alm . Count Almeyda Well , well , all this I know ; but I also know that my daughter is his judge , and that she loves Carlos : is n't that enough . Believe me , my friend , there 's no danger . Come ; walk with me to my room : I must slip on a robe of state . enter GUSMAN . Gus . Gusman My lord , every thing is ready . Alm .

But go , Gusman ; order the trumpets to sound ; the drums to beat , and the music to strike up . Come , count ; away , Gusman ! Exeunt Almeyda and Arandez on one side . Gusman opposite . SCENE II  --  the court . Sound drums and trumpets ; then music play a grand march . At the bottom of a splendid hall is an elevated throne ; over which is a rich canopy , surmounted by plumes ; the drapery is velvet , green and gold ; the arms of the count , embroidered on the throne . On the right of the throne , Beatrice , the accuser , and on the left , a lady as recorder , seated in gilt chairs ; tables and books before them . Knights , in complete armour , stand on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arches , in a room beyond the hall . Ladies in rich dresses , sit on raised seats , which extend , on each side of the hall , from near the throne , towards the front of the stage . A herald is near the throne . While the music is playing , count ALMEYDA enters in a magnificent dress , leading EUGENIA , who is dressed splendidly and wears a coronet on her head ; her train is borne by two pages . Almeyda conducts her to the throne ; bows respectfully , and retires to the right , near the front extremity of the ladies seats . When Eugenia is seated , the ladies , who had risen at her entrance , resume their places . The music stops . Trumpets . Eug . Eugenia Let the Prisoner appear . Trumpets . enter CARLOS , guarded by men-at-arms . Count ARANDEZ last : he stops near Almeyda .

PACOMO follows his master ; and , as he crosses , drops on both knees before the throne ; holding up his clasped hands : he takes his place near Carlos . Two of the guard station themselves behind Carlos . Trumpets . Alm . Count Almeyda How is this ? What makes the follower here ? Pac . Pacomo Not his good will , signor ; and so , having your lordship 's leave , I 'll retire . ( turns , and attempts to go ; one of the guard presents his lance . Pacomo stops ) Car . Carlos My servant was confined with me , at the suggestion , as I imagined , of the sage lady , who , I perceive is my accuser . The reason , as he himself informed me , was , that fired by her charms  --  ( Pacomo , in trepidation pulls Carlos 's cloak . Beatrice rises in anger , and is about to speak . Eugenia waves to the herald . Herald . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It would ill become the dignity of this court , to sanction this levity ; nor must the prisoner forget that he is before a tribunal which demands , and will exact respect . ( Carlos replies with a profound reverence ) Alm . Count Almeyda ( asid to Arandez ) By saint Jago , my daughter speaks as if she had been born a judge . Eug . Eugenia The court is ready : let the trial proceed . Bea . Beatrice The prisoner will stand forth . What is your name ? ( Carlos does not reply . Almeyda enjoys his apparent confusion ) Alm . Count Almeyda I will answer for him  --  Carlos . ( Carlos affects surprise at being known ) Bea . Beatrice ( after directing the recorder ) Are you a gentleman ? ( Carlos is indignant )  --  What is your rank ? Alm . Count Almeyda I can avouch that his birth entitles him to trial by a Court of Love . ( Carlos again affects astonishment ) Bea .

Alm . Count Almeyda ( aside ) Bravo , bravo ! Bea . Beatrice Need I recall to the view of this august tribunal , events , unhappily but too well known to the whole world !

Count Almeyda When she finds them . ( aside ) Pac . Pacomo ( aside , joyfully ) Courage , Pacomo ; nothing of you yet . Bea . Beatrice ( having found the place ) It is , therefore , sufficiently proved that this disloyal knight is guilty , according to the laws of chivalry , and has incurred the penalty of degradation from its honourable ranks . Alm . Count Almeyda With submission to the court : not until he has had an opportunity to defend himself . Bea . Beatrice ( in her own manner ) He ca n't defend himself , my lord .  --  And as to the insolent valet who attend him  --  Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) O ! poor Pacomo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pac . Pacomo Good lady Beatrice  --  Bea . Beatrice He had therefore better be removed  --  Pac . Pacomo True . ( turning to go ) Bea . Beatrice And hanged forthwith . Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) O you old Jezebel ! Alm . Count Almeyda Their offence is the same : the ' squire 's fate must therefore depend upon that of the knight . Pac . Pacomo O ! if that 's all , your lordship need give yourself no further trouble . My master it seems is to lose his spurs : but , as I have none , why e'en take my boots , and let me go . ( about to pull off his boots : the guard prevents him ) Bea . Beatrice Write down , madam Recorder , that if the knight is degraded , the squire is to be hanged . Eug . Eugenia ( in a commanding tone ) Too much of this : there seems to be a general forgetfulness of the solemn cause of our assembling . Alm . Count Almeyda ( aside to Arandez ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ar . Count Arandez Is it acting ? Alm . Count Almeyda You shall see presently . Eug . Eugenia The chevalier Carlos has heard of what he is accused : we wait his answer . Car . Carlos I do not deny the facts charged against me :  --  Pac . Pacomo ( aside ) O , the devil , the devil ! Car . Carlos But I demand of all those who behold the lady Eugenia , whether it be possible for a lover who is near her , to attend to the cold dicatates of reason ; and whether the effects of a delirium caused by herself , ought not to deserve her clemency . Alm . Count Almeyda ( aside ) Good ! Ar . Count Arandez ( aside ) The dog ! Pac . Pacomo ( aside , rubbing his hands ) Very well , master of mine . Bea . Beatrice ( sneeringly ) A fine defence , truly ! Neither more nor less than an apology for all kinds of libertinism . I presume the court is of my opinion . ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Arandez ) But hear my daughter . Eug . Eugenia I agree with the accuser . The chevalier 's reply , made after cool reflection , is if possible , more offensive than his previous conduct . Ar . Count Arandez ( to Almeyda , who looks blank ) Is she acting still ? Alm . Count Almeyda ( with hesitation ) Certainly . Bea . Beatrice Write down , that the prisoner has nothing to say for himself  --  It only remains , then , to proceed to sentence . Alm . Count Almeyda Pardon me : according to the statute , if to one of two questions propounded. the chevalier answer in a manner deemed proper by the court , he is still acquitted .  --  I submit the questions . ( walks up and lays a paper on the accuser 's table ) Pac . Pacomo ( to Carlos ) Now , signor , for the love of all the saints , pluck up all the little wit you have . Eug . Eugenia The court perceives the irregularity in my lord advocate 's proposing the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prisoner . Alm . Count Almeyda ( to Arandez ) You see ? in favour of the prisoner . Eug . Eugenia Read the first question . Bea . Beatrice " Which of the two sexes is the more perfect ? " ( Carlos smiles ) Pac . Pacomo Nay , signor , do n't take it so easy : if you do n't regard your spurs , think of my neck . Bea . Beatrice " Which of the two sexes is the more perfect ? " Car . Carlos A gallant man would say ,  --  the female : a sensible woman would think  --  the male . Alm . Count Almeyda ( to Arandez ) What say you to that ?  --  ( to the court ) The answer appears to be valid ? Bea . Beatrice Valid ! it 's ridiculous . For example . I am no fool , I presume ; and yet , compared to ours , I do not value the other sex a straw . Is there a sensible woman here who thinks differently ? ( looking round the court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorders ) Pac . Pacomo Yes , I 'm going . I shall be hang 'd for your want of wit . Alm . Count Almeyda Will not my daughter silence that old withch ! Ar . Count Arandez No ; and my son will be publicly disgraced by your manuvring . Eug . Eugenia Read the Second question . Alm . Count Almeyda ( addressing Eugenia ) What , madam , have you nothing to observe on the first question ? Eug . Eugenia Nothing . Alm . Count Almeyda And you think the answer was absurd ? Eug . Eugenia The court have decided .  --  Read the second question . Ar . Count Arandez ( to Almeyda , who is in amaze ) She acts well . Bea . Beatrice " Which condition of life is most favourable to the glory of a female ? " Car . Carlos It is the greatest glory of a female to rule ; and women govern lovers only : in every other character , man assumes the sway . Alm . Count Almeyda This time , at least , the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beatrice The answer has not common sense . Sway , indeed ! what woman of spirit would submit to a man in any state ? Alm . Count Almeyda ( in a rage ) You , madam , you  --  Do you forget twenty years ago ? Do you forget captain Diego ? Bea . Beatrice ( choaked with passion ) Diego was a villain . Alm . Count Almeyda You submitted none the less for that ; and before marriage too . ( Eugenia waves to the herald ) Herald . Herald Silence ! Eug . Eugenia The court will not permit this language . Alm . Count Almeyda My daughter says true : we want reasons , and not senseless assertions . Eug . Eugenia ( very coolly ) My lord advocate shall have reasons . Alm . Count Almeyda What ! against the justness of the answer ? Eug . Eugenia Yes , my lord . Alm . Count Almeyda I defy you , madam ; I defy your malice . Eug . Eugenia One portion of the chevalier 's answer is unobjectionable ; for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire over the weaker sex . But what sensible and delicate woman would deem it glorious even to exercise a sway which Love , ' t is said , allows ? No ; ' t is slander on the sex to call that glorious to it , which would degrade it .

Ar . Count Arandez ( to Almeyda ) She acts well . Pac . Pacomo O ! I 'm dead and buried ! Alm . Count Almeyda ( in a rage ) What fury , what fiend possesses you , madam ! Did you not , an hour ago , almost with tears in your eyes , plead for the ehevalier ? Eug . Eugenia ' T is true I did ; but your arguments , your just resentment have penetrated my heart .
