County Judge George W. Martin , before the State Senate in removal proceedings , took the stand in his own defense today and categorically denied the first of the six charges against him  --  that he had been the " front " for questionable financial ventures . After the evidence on this charge had been completely presented to the Senate by mid-afternoon today , Martin W. Littleton , chief defense counsel , called Judge Martin to the stand as the principal , and possibly the only , defense witness . Judge Martin , speaking very rapidly , in clear tones , declared he never had participated in the sale of stock in either the Filmland or Bay-f side Amusement Company , in both of which investors lost all their money . He denied that he ever had urged any one to buy stock in either company or that he had knowledge of the fact that his name ever was used to induce any one to buy stock . Firm Under Amen Questioning Pressed later in the day , on crossexamination by John Harlan Amen , Judge Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who said he had urged the purchase of Filmland or . Bayside stock . Questioned specifically about the testimony of witnesses who recounted either personal or telephone conversations with him , the judge took the position that while the calls or phone conversations might have taken place , he would not remember them . In those conversations he could never have urged the purchase of stock , because he never did ' do that , he insisted . The first question in cross-examination by Mr. Amen was whether Judge Martin ever had read the canon of judicial ethics , which declares that a judge should avoid giving , ground for reasonable suspicion that he is using the prestige of his office to contribute to the success of a private enterprise , or even a charitable one . Judge Martin replied that he had never read the canon of judicial ethics , and to date had read only those parts of it that are cited in the charges before the Senate . He was certain he had not read it in 1925 , when the Bayside and Filmland enterprises were started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a day that started with an explanation of the affairs of the Foreign Petroleum Corporation , another company with which Judge Martin was connected . In this testimony Louis Principe , prominent Brooklyn builder , testified that he had sent both a letter and a cablegram to Judge Martin from Milan , Italy , telling him that the company was a " phony " and asking him so to inform the other directors , so that the interests of the stockholders could be protected . Instead Judge Martin merely resigned , Mr. Principe said . When he told Judge Martin he was disappointed with his course of action , the judge said , according to Mr. Principe : " Louis , I have enough trouble of my own . I do n't want to bother any more with this company . " Before Mr. Principe went to Europe , he said he had informed Judge Martin of his intention to look into the real situation , and Judge Martin had wished him luck , he said . The only other witness of the day was James H. Adamson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayside and Filmland Theatres . He was brought in to prove that after Judge Martin got into trouble , he persuaded Mr. Adamson to wipe out judgments totaling 510,600 , in return for a verbal promise to pay 8500 or $600 , which money never was paid . Mr. Adamson , under questioning by Mr. Littleton. indicated that the settlement was for a promise that Judge Martin would pay the money when he got out of trouble , a moment which had not yet arrived ? , Mr. Littleton noted in the record . He never pressed Judge Martin for money on the spot , before relinquishing the judgments , he declared . Mr. Amen reread to Mr. Adamson his grand jury testimony , which showed Mr. Adamson as first asking for a $2,000 settlement and then asking for at least a token payment of some kind before giving up the satisfactions of the judgments . Mr : Adamson contended that both versions were true , and both sides let the matter rest there . Match Company Case torney general and the post office authorities . Judge Martin declared that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin stuck to his story , denying all stock selling activity or knowledge of it . Occasionally , he declared that he had no present recollection of the facts as stated by Mr. Amen , but that if the latter could refresh his ( Judge Martin 's ) memory by some paper or document , he would be glad to change his answer . Mr. Amen took occasion to do this once or twice , the first time being when Judge Martin insisted that he gave $1,000 to the Filmland Comp-ny without a thought of get-j ting it back . Ilk 1930 Testimony Read Mr. Amen read him his own testimony before the attorney general in 1930 , at which time the judge testified that the $1,000 was lent under agreement . The money was I given by Judge Martin , all agreed , ' at a time when he was appealing to other stockholders to subscribe to prevent foreclosure of the theatre . Judge Martin said today that the 1930 testimony probably was correct . The judge contended all through I his examination twat only once had he had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Filmland or Bayside stockselling , and on that occasion he summoned the salesmen to his office and forbade them to use his name further . In general , the defense used the tactics of taking up the specification , sentence by sentence , and having . Judge Martin either affirm or deny the statements made . The statements of fact of Judge Martin 's connection with the companies were admitted , and those about his connection with stock-selling were denied . Mr. Amen tried to bring out that the judge had , either in his own or his wife 's name , stock in Filmland and Bayside that was given to him and that it had value because it was being sold by salesmen at the time . In the case of Filmland Judge Martin contended the stock was worthless , always had been and always would be , and that he did not , care what it was being sold for , since he had no knowledge of that fact . In the case of Bayside he contended that the half interest he had in that company was shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually issued to him . Acting under the spur of Lieutenant Governor Poletti , Majority Leader Hanley , Minority Leader Dunnigan and Judiciary Chairman Feinberg , the Senate proceedings moved at a much faster pace today than at any other time . The first thing the Senate leaders did was to stop the aslri ? g of questions of The last specification under Charge No. 1 , that Judge Martin attempted to obtain financial backing for the Match Corporation of America , was virtually agreed to by both sides with a set of stipulations as to the facts in the case , disagreement being only on whether Judge Martin actually received 60,000 shares of stock in the company , to he returned if he failed to get the hacking , or whether the shares were merely promised to him . It developed they were put in Judge Martin 's safe after beifig listed in the name of his court attendant , and Judge Martin later personally returned the stock .
