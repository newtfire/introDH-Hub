Much of the personal drama of politics takes place behind the scenes . Here are some of the latest whispered tales from the campaign trail : <P> How Clinton is ducking Dukakis . After shying from a presidential bid of his own , boyish Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton told his friend and preferred candidate Michael Dukakis that he would seriously consider endorsing him , and might even take a top post with his campaign . That would have helped undercut Albert Gore 's claim as the South 's favorite son , something both Clinton and Dukakis would not mind . It would also have enhanced , if Dukakis were to get the nomination , Clinton 's objective to be the convention keynote speaker . But as Dukakis , in a hotel room surrounded by aides , was preparing for the Des Moines Register debate , Clinton telephoned and explained with great discomfort that he had decided not to make an endorsement yet . His explanation : problems with the Arkansas legislature . The real reason : the rise in Gore 's Southern popularity made bucking him now too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is paid as a consulting fee to a group called Concord Associates , so the recipient 's name does n't pop up on campaign reports . A deposit of $15,000 was made last July . In fact , the money goes to Alexander Haig 's son and namesake Alex Haig , who helps manage his father 's campaign . Though unusual , there was nothing illegal about the arrangement , and young Haig says it was all quite legitimate . Nevertheless , starting this month , he and his wife Wendy will dissolve Concord Associates and start receiving paychecks in their own names . The young Haigs ' first paychecks : $5,000 each . <P> Why Reagan did n't duck Dole . Despite his attempts to seem neutral , the President prefers his loyal Veep to Robert Dole , who over the years has let loose with some caustic comments about Reagan 's management style . This preference was put to the test last month when Dole called Chief of Staff Howard Baker with terms for announcing his support of the INF treaty . Dole wanted an invitation to the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the treaty . Baker approved the plan . But Reagan angrily balked , called Bush and told him about Dole 's proposal . Reagan said he would refuse if the Vice President wanted . " George , it 's up to you , " Reagan said . Bush took only a few minutes to consider . " You need his help , " he told the President . " I do n't like the whole thing , but you need this . " At the ensuing meeting , Reagan shied as far away from Dole as possible . <P> Nixon is n't ducking . Less reluctant support for Dole comes from a former occupant of the Oval Office . Richard Nixon , who favors Dole , has been quietly passing along advice and encouragement , mainly through intermediaries . <P> Stepping on Bush 's lines . When Bush 's aides saw the education section in early drafts of Reagan 's State of the Union address , they were upset . Not because the Vice President disagreed with the words  --  just the opposite . Many of the ideas , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are ones that Bush has been pushing ( to little notice ) on the campaign trail . The Bush people could not persuade the White House to leave the topic to them . One of Bush 's aides said of Reagan 's newest education initiative , " We 're going to say  --  nicely , of course  --  that he stole the idea from us. "
