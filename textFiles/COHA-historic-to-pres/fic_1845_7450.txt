Chivers , T. H. ( Thomas Holley ) , 1809-1858 : THE LOST PLEIAD : AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF MY FIRST-BORN. from The lost pleiad ( 1845 ) " Jehovah bless thee and keep thee : Jehovah make his face to shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee ! Jehovah lift his countenance upon thee , and give thee peace ! "  --  Numbers , vi. : 24-26 . " Mild from the first beginning of her days ; Gentlest of all in Heaven . "  --  Hesiod . Life 's anthem she had just begun To sing , when she was called to die ; And now dost sing beyond the sun With Angels in the heavens on high . For , she was beautiful as pure , And seemed to live on earth secure From every harm , when Death 's cold frost Lay on the rosebud of her heart , And tore its tender leaves apart  --  The very heart my soul loved most ! The Lydian mode of her soft voice Did make my very heart rejoice ; For she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Clear as the wild sweet notes , unheard By me before , of some rare bird From Eden-isles beyond the sea . Winnowed upon thy silent breast , Death-palsied , thy soft fingers lie , While , underneath , thy heart doth rest , Colder than cold , all silently ! Yes ! thy pale limbs are cold in death ! As silent as the snow-white shroud Which wraps thy tender form beneath , Like some lone , solitary cloud The infant , pale New Moon Just from the old one born  --  For , thou wert taken sick at noon , And died before the next day morn ! Alas ! thou wilt awake no more ! A death-frost is upon thy brow ! And on thy heart 's deep , silent core , A cold , damp dew is settling now ! But thou dost seem to sweetly sleep , And calmly slumber , free from pain  --  Not knowing I am doomed to weep , Never , on earth , to smile again ! And though thy saintly form is hid Beneath thy screwed-down coffin-lid ; Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same dear creature to my heart ! Thou hast the same cerulean eyes Of my first-born , now in the skies  --  The same sweet lips of rosy hue , Whereon thy breath hung like the dew On rosebuds when they first dispart , Disclosing thus their inmost heart , Embalmed in fragrance  --  such as thine Gave out to me in love divine Embalmed in speech  --  such as was given The Angel Israfel in Heaven . Oh , God ! how hard it was to part From one who was so dear to me ! It was like taking out my heart  --  The very heart that bleeds for thee ! The raptures of divinest love I felt for thee , my snow-white Dove ! When thou wert from that World of Bliss Sent down to make a Heaven of this , Which ever seemed , while thou wert here , Transformed into some other sphere  --  Some happier world , where all is bright , As if some Angel , full of light , Had come down from the heavens above , And changed it into one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the silent tomb  --  ( Thus lying in that grave of thine , As she does in the heavens , supine )  --  And with the day of thy sweet light Dissolve away the grave 's dark night , And make it brighter than the morn , My Angel-child ! when thou wert born  --  When thou didst first become to me The Morning-star of life 's sweet day  --  As bright as that which thou dost see , In Heaven above  --  now far away ! The golden locks of thy soft hair Lay floating on thy forehead fair , In silken ringlets , on the day When thou wert called from earth away  --  From gladdening me with thy blue eyes  --  To join thy SISTERS in the skies ! Thy spirit 's soul-delighting face Was smothered in the soft embrace Of Angels , when they , from the skies , Leant down with their sweet melodies , In rapturous joy , to hail thee theirs , And , by the keen light of the stars , Beheld thee , like a snow-white Dove , Ascending through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And bore thee , singing , out of sight , And entered that Divine Abode , To dwell for evermore with God . For , as within its silken tomb , The silk-worm enters to become A full-grown chrysalis , in form As different from the parent worm As is the silk which it has spun From the green leaf it feeds upon ; So does the soul cast off its form  --  Even as the chrysalis the worm  --  And rise up from its mortal night , A spiritual body , clothed in light , As different from its body here , As Heaven is from this sinful sphere . Then think not , Mortal ! it is strange That Man must undergo this change ; For who would ever think , from form , A BUTTERFLY had been a worm ? And who would ever think to see A worm , as green as green can be , Become , soon after spinning silk , A BUTTERFLY as white as milk ? If green worms turn to BUTTERFLIES , When from their silken tombs they rise , Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies thus shall spurn  --  Leaving them , as the worm its skin , To rot the cold , dark grave within ? Nothing can be more strange to me , Than such a change , so suddenly ! Therefore , I doubt not that this form Contains within it , as a worm The BUTTERFLY , another bright And glorious body , full of light  --  Undying in its nature  --  pure  --  Here in this fleshly house secure  --  Which , when this mortal body dies , Will , on its own bright wings , arise , As doth the BUTTERFLY , when free From its frail tenement , to be A child of dalliance , as it is , Amid those FIELDS OF ENDLESS BLISS , Where shines above thy sportive play The sunlight of immortal day . I doubt not , then , that we shall be United in that WORLD OF BLISS , Where thou shalt be the same to me As thou hast ever been in this . I sometimes see thee , in my dreams , Beside those clear Elysian streams Which flow out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's Eternity , whereon Is built His Everlasting Throne . Thou wast , in this dark world below , The shadow of what thou art now , In that high world of endless peace , Whose songs of joy shall never cease . As thou canst not return to me , I know that I must go to thee ! For Death is but the gate from this Dark world into immortal bliss , Through which my soul must shortly go , Thy pure delights in Heaven to know . And though my grief is more than vain , Yet , I shall never cease to grieve ! Because , no more while I shall live , Will I behold thy face again ! No more while I have life or breath  --  No more till I shall turn to dust ! But I shall see thee after death , And in the heavens above , I trust ! For thy pure body now at rest , And not thy soul among the blest  --  Although to me it was most dear  --  Is this frail stone erected here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of immortality , And needs no token of the grief Which thus alone can find relief . For by thy grave I seem to be Again in thy sweet company , Which love for thee has made to me The very best society . And while I bend me here alone Above this Monumental Stone , Weeping away my heart for thee In tears which flow continually  --  ( Praying that I may meet thee there , In that HIGH WORLD , where Angels are )  --  If thou , from that Celestial sphere , Canst look upon my sorrowing here  --  Even as the Moon upon the sea  --  Let thy pure soul look down on me , Untroubled in that World of Bliss , While I am sorrowing here in this ! And pardon me that I now grieve That thou on earth hast ceased to live ! That thy dear body here can be No more in this dark world with me ! The thought of which doth make me bow Before thy grave in sorrow now ! And , oh ! forgive me for the sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure peace which is The guerdon of immortal bliss ; And know that it is love for thee Which makes me weep so bitterly ! For that which is in Heaven above Alone can estimate my love ! For , out of thy pure , sacred dust , I build my monumental trust , Which rises from thy grave to thee  --  Full in the front of Deity ! For , as thy soul on joyous wing Did upward from thy body spring  --  Rejoicing in its Heavenward flight To gain those FIELDS OF PURE DELIGHT , Where flowers of love immortal grow , And rivers of pure water flow  --  So , rises from my soul to thee The hopes of immortality ! When thou wert in this world with me , Bright Angel of the Heavenly lands ! Thou wert not fed by mortal hands , But by the Nymphs , who gave to thee The bread of immortality  --  Such as thy spirit now doth eat In that high world of endless love , While walking with thy snowy feet Along the sapphire-paven street , Before the jasper-walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that heavenly Hymn Sung by the lips of Cherubim In Paradise , before the fall , In glory bright , outshining all In that great City of pure gold , The Angels talked about of old . Because of thine untimely fate , Am I thus left disconsolate ! Because thou wilt return to be No more in this dark world with me ! Must these salt tears of sorrow flow Out of my heart forever more ! Forever more as they do now ! Out of my heart forever more ! Thou wert my snow-white Jessamine  --  My little Angel-Eglantine ! My saintly Lily ! who didst grow Upon thy mother 's arms of snow  --  Of whom thou wert the image true  --  Whose tears fell on thy leaves for dew  --  All but those deep blue eyes of thine  --  They were the miniatures of mine , Thou Blossom of that heavenly Tree , Whose boughs are barren now for thee ! The sweetest bud she ever bore ! Who art transplanted to the skies To blossom there forever more Amid the Flowers of Paradise . Thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth was given . I once did think it should adorn Thy little sister to be born ; But no , it shall not be  --  her name Shall be like thine  --  but not the same . For then , she may not have the eyes Of my first-born now in the skies , Whose tender limbs where white as snow  --  As virgin as her soul is now  --  Who came me in this world to bless With such celestial loveliness , That , in the light of her blue eyes , I seemed to dwell in Paradise , And know how bright the Angels were In Heaven , by gazing upon her . For she was gentle as the flowers Which she had gathered from the bowers , The day before she died , for me  --  Her breath so full of fragrancy . Much softer than the unweaned lamb New-washed with crystal water , Was thy pure body , now so calm , My darling little daughter ! For thou dost sleep beneath the shade Of four young Cedars , which now spread Their branches over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Brought from the hills of Lebanon , And planted here by me , dear One ! At every corner of thy tomb , To speak of me in years to come  --  To say to those who pass them by , We are four mourners standing round This holy , consecrated ground  --  Four verdant Angels round the head And feet of her who now is dead  --  Whose soul is in the heavens on high  --  With wings of evergreen outspread  --  To emblem that which can not die . And though mine eyes shall see thy face No more  --  around thy dwelling-place , Shall flourish these four Trees of God To ornament thy blest abode . In every corner underneath , To emblem thy more fragrant breath , The white buds of the Jessamine Now blossom round the Myrtle Vine , Which spreads its evergreen above To emblem mine eternal love  --  From whose green , oval leaves , sweet thing ! Like bits of immortality Cut from the azure heavens on high By some great Sculptor-Angel , who Had polished them his whole life through  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , from size , As if made out of thy blue eyes  --  Which sheds an Eden-like perfume All April long upon thy tomb ! Until my death , or soon or late , My heart shall be disconsolate ! Shall grieve for thee forever more ! Forever more still grieve for thee ! Till we shall meet on that sweet shore , Where all our grieving shall be o'er  --  In Heaven above eternally . And till that hour , there shall be none In Heaven to match my love  --  not one ! Not even the mightiest Angel there , Shall his great love with mine compare ! It is as deep as deep can be  --  It rises from this world to thee ! Full as the ocean is of water , Is my fond heart for thee , sweet Daughter ! Sweet Daughter ! is my heart for thee ! Full as the ever-brimful sea  --  The ever-brimful sea  --  with love  --  Is my fond heart for thine above ! And I did thank the God of Heaven That He this recompense had given  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very weak ! For , I did once more hear her voice , Which made my breaking heart rejoice ! Which but to hear on earth again  --  To hear it as I heard it then  --  Like Angels ' whispers when they tell The living where the dead may dwell  --  I would give all that could be given By man on earth this side of Heaven ! I would be willing , could this be , To suffer pain eternally ! For I was overwhelmed with grief , And could not give my child relief ! The very love I had for her , When most I wished to minister To her relief , did make me less A minister in my distress ! And then , with more than mortal dread , I laid my hand upon her head ! It was as clammy cold with sweat , As roseleaves in the frost-dew wet ! I wiped away the death-cold dew  --  Her once soft pearly nails were blue ! The cramp was in her hands and feet ! Her breath , that once was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the cold earth of the tomb ! For , oh ! the agonizing pain Had palsied her young tender brain , Till were the pupils of her eyes Dilated twice their natural size ! The pearly al of her nose , Like frost-bit petals of the rose , Were both contracted , cold and thin ; And her blue eyes had both sunk in ! And her soft , heart-enfolding breast Kept panting with that heart 's unrest ! For , as her feeble breath grew thick , Her thread-like pulse became more quick ! And then her pale , cold lips I kist , And laid my hand upon her wrist ! Her pulse had almost ceased to beat ! And then I felt her icy feet ! Oh , God ! to think of that child now , Doth wring the life-drops from my brow ! I then grew speechless with despair , And offered up to God one prayer  --  One voiceless prayer  --  in my deep grief ; But He would give me no relief ! Then , in the depths of my distress  --  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prayed to Him to let me die ! Oh ! if thy ears be to Despair Forever open , hear my prayer ! If Thou canst pity my distress , Scorn not my soul in bitterness ! When but one whisper of thy breath Can save her from the pangs of death ! When but one whisper of thy voice Can make her father 's heart rejoice ! And then I bowed to earth my head ! ( Oh ! how my heart within me bled ! ) And , with the mightiness of pain , I cried out from my soul again , My child is dead ! my child is dead ! And strewed my garments in the dust  --  Still lifting up to Him my trust  --  Saying , Thou knowest a father 's love ! The Angels Father Thee above ! If Thou dost love thy children 's voice , Speak ! that my child may live again ! Let me not ask of Thee in vain ! And make her father 's heart rejoice ! Let her not go into the grave ! But save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be now in pure delight , Let her return to me to-night ! For Heaven itself can never be What that dear child has been to me ! For , since the morning of her birth , Has she not been my Heaven on earth ? Which , since her death , has been to me The worst of hells continually ! Oh ! raise her up as she was then , And let her make it Heaven again ! And then I knelt down by my child , ( For now my sorrow had grown wild , ) Where , like the young Moon in some cloud , Which her own beauty has made bright  --  She lay all wrapped up in her shroud , As bright to me as she to night ! And then , as do the far-off skies , Beyond some cloud of pearly white , Beneath her half-closed lids , her eyes Appeared to me all blue and bright  --  For Death had not eclipsed their light ! Then , every string in my poor heart By grief 's strong hands were torn apart ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strings of some sweet lute By ruffian-hands are rent in twain  --  Never , on earth , to sound again ! As Mary of her brother cried  --  Lord ! hadst thou been there by her side , My little Florence had not died ! And then the people said to me , Why all this waste of agony ? What is the use of all this grief ? It will not give your heart relief ! And then , to reconcile my mind , They said , You are of men most blind ! This selfish sorrow will not see That God is dealing righteously ! You act as though you had no sense , Thus to arraign His providence ! For Christ himself was born to die  --  He suffered mortal agony ! For , when the mountain-rock was riven , The Sun then hid his face in heaven , As if he could not bear to see His Maker suffering agony ! And when the Temple 's vail was rent , Thick darkness filled the firmament ! And there were Angels heard above , Complaining of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , While suffering so much agony ! And then I made them this reply : But , oh ! His grief was not like mine , For mine is mortal  --  His , divine ! Then , how superior is my pain , To know His life was all His own  --  That He had power to lay it down , And then to take it up again ! But I have none in my distress  --  My more than mortal bitterness ! Not even the power , which brings relief , To suffer my exceeding grief ! For bearing suffering sometimes is The way to conquer our distress . This power He had to such extent , He drew from it His whole content . For , when He prayed the cup might pass , He bowed His head to Death , alas ! And when He seemed to suffer most , With joy divine  --  " gave up the ghost ! " I thought that , when my mother died , Nothing in all this world beside Could ever give me so much pain , Or grieve my broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Which told that she had ceased to be , The world seemed swallowed up in night  --  All darkened for the want of light ! For , when I found that she was dead , The blood all rushed into my heal , And drowned the organs of my mind , Till I , at length , became stone-blind ! Then I began on God to call , And ask if I had lost my all ! If that dear being who had given Me joy on earth  --  had gone to Heaven ! And thus , for four long , trying years , I wept away my heart to tears , Wrung by the bitterest agony  --  Praying to God that I might die ! But this deep grief was pure delight , Compared with that I felt the night That my child died ! for , when she died , The world died with her ! all beside ! Yes ! when that precious being left , I was of Heaven on earth bereft ! She died ! No  --  Death did not destroy My child  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on earth  --  Born on the morning of her birth ! For , when they did my child inter , Joy went into the grave with her ! But , still in Heaven  --  in that high sphere  --  She is my child as she was here ; Wherever her dear soul may be , She is the same dear child to me ! For , as the milk-white lamb lies down Beneath some shady tree at noon , And on the myrtle green reposes , In Sharon 's Garden full of roses ; So , thou dost take thy peaceful rest In that High World among the blest . I put on sackloth on the day When thou wert called from earth away ! My body then in nakedness Was left to emblem my distress ! Oh ! when shall I be clothed again , In linen garments , free from stain , To emblem my deliverance From sorrow in its widest sense ? Never , until I go away , Where she is gone , to endless Day ! Never , until there shall be given Those garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Angels wear in Heaven . Although my heart was bursting ope , My sorrowing was not " without hope , " As poor Quinctilian 's was , when he Mourned for his absent family  --  When Death destroyed his little ones  --  His darling wife  --  his precious sons ! For , in the madness of his grief , He would not stoop to find relief ; But lost all relish for those things That once gave joy in murmurings , Which evermore grew more intense , Till he accused even Providence , And said , with grief-embittered tongue , The God of Heaven had done him wrong ! But He had reaped where He had sown , And taken nothing but His own . If Thou art Mercy 's Father , hear ! And turn to me Thy gracious ear ! This mode of goodness dwells in Thee , To succor those in misery ! Thy mercy is the heavens above , And Thou art called the " God of Love ! " Thine uncreated fulness gives The soul the joy by which it lives ! Thine all-sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou art the bounteous pourer forth Of all the good we have on earth ! The " Gracious One , " whose goodness is The fountain of our hopes of bliss ! Forever flowing , full forever ! Forever flowing , failing never ! Forever emptying , like the sea  --  Forever full eternally ! The " God of comfort " I would see  --  The " Goel " who can ransom me ! The Bonah who can me restore , And comfort me forever more ! Who , stooping from the heavens above , Hast come to earth with thy deep love , And turned affliction 's bitter sting To joy by thy kind ministering ; And all my many wants supplied  --  Nothing my soul desired denied ; Who chasteneth , yet upbraideth not  --  Look down upon my wretched lot ! And shed upon my soul the light Of Thy sweet countenance to-night ! The Stars , with all their burning fires , Th ' adoring Angels with their choirs  --  A chorus of inspired Saints  --  With Heaven 's divine inhabitants  --  In that sublime Doxology  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips of Seraphim  --  Heard by Isaiah in th ' abode And Temple of the Living God  --  Praise Thee forever more on high , Thou God of immortality ! Shouting aloud Thy name to bless For thine exceeding loveliness  --  Thou , who art known in Heaven so well  --  The Holy One of Israel ! But God refused to hear my prayer ! ( And Death sat mocking my despair ! ) And trod upon my utmost trust , And trampled all my hopes to dust ! And laid my child into the grave , When He had all the power to save ! The first that He to me had given , Because He wanted her in Heaven ! And then I felt my heart was breaking , And all alone for her dear sake ! And knew that Hope was me forsaking , As one would his own soul forsake ! And then , as one half reconciled To what he can not help , I smiled , And said to God  --  Now keep my child ! And now this sorrow for thy sake , In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears out of mine eyes , Is but my pleasure in disguise . And what doth seem like grief or wo , Is but my joy on earth to know  --  ( For such deep grief to joy is given )  --  That my dear child is now in Heaven . Thus , what doth seem to thee like pain , Is knowing we shall meet again . For all pure joy is but the same As grief  --  they differ but in name . For grief is joy above the height Of that sad joy we call delight . And thus , in grieving , we express That our deep joy is in excess . Thus , joy , for Love , becomes so deep , It turns to grief , which makes us weep . This grief , expressive of our love , Is like that joy they feel above  --  That holy joy which fills the sight With tears of infinite delight ; That joy above which joy below Doth ape by rising into wo . The dying swan is said to sing Away its soul in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it false with latest breath . The swan is said thus to lament , When telling sweetest its content . For that which feels the most relief , Appears to be in deepest grief . So full of pathos is the strain That tells of joy , it seems like pain . Then , what is sorrow , but the sense Of one soul 's joy when most intense ? So , what appears like grief to thee , Is but the deepest joy to me . Since that dear being , loved from birth , Has vanished from the face of earth , And soared into the heavens above , And left me nothing here to love ; I love , to reconcile my mind , The sorrow she has left behind ; And this becomes more dear to me Than any thing on earth can be , Because it is the only thing That she has left me  --  sorrowing ! The only thing that I now have To comfort me this side the grave ! The cherished relic she has given To make me think of her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Delight to me doth minister ; Though it be sorrow , pain , or grief , Yet , it doth bring my heart relief . Therefore , I cherish that which is My portion left on earth below , Let it be sorrow , pain or bliss  --  Since joy to me is nought but wo , And wo deep joy  --  which this shall be Forever more  --  eternally ! And while I iive on earth below , Beside thy grave to worship so , It gives me joy almost as great , And makes this more than wretched state , ( As if thou still wert living here )  --  More pleasant than it doth appear . For , while I live by part of thee , I hope that other part to see , When I shall die , in Heaven above , Which makes me more thy body love . For , thinking of that one in bliss , Doth make me more attached to this Since knowing that in Heaven above Did once live here for me to love , When both were one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body is on earth to me , Like some bright star seen in the sea , The brightest of the stars of even  --  The image of that one in Heaven  --  Which were not there for me to love , But for the soul of it above ; For , when we see it there , we know The one in Heaven doth make it so ; Thus , Heaven above dwells here below . So with her body  --  here , it is The image of her soul in bliss , Which , but for that dear soul in Heaven , Had never unto me been given . And thus her form appears to me Like that bright star seen in the sea , Which , though it shows its image nigh , Its soul is in the heavens on high . And like that star , amid the storm , Setting , though still forever bright , Appeared her soul through her sick form , Till it had vanished from my sight ! And then , in death , she seemed to be Still living in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in night , Long after all the stars are gone  --  So was my soul for her sweet light , In this dark world  --  alone  --  alone ! Thus , like the sphere-tones of her voice , Which made my breaking heart rejoice  --  More plaintive than the tones of love , Sung latest by the dying Dove , When , on her death-revealing tongue , The last bit of her heart , in song , Is breathed away in one soft coo That melts into the heavens like dew ; Or , that sad bird of Mexico , Whose song is with such pathos rise , The ravishing sweetness pains it so , It sings but one time in its life , And , dying , soars to Heaven on high On wings of its own melody ; So , faded from my soul that day , All in the flowery month of May  --  One of those radiant Cherubim Who sang to me that heavenly hymn ! And like the new-born Moon supine , So died she in these arms of mine , To rise , like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in Heaven ! For , when her precious life did cease , Two star-crowned Ministers of Peace , With music soft as was the love That bore her up to Heaven above  --  Attended her to that HIGH BOURNE " From whence no traveler shall return . " Then what is Death ? What is the grave ? A friend to life  --  the home I crave ! Where Man shall lay his body down , And rest in dreamless sleep alone ! For grief it is the softest bed  --  A pillow for the aching head  --  A Hospital for all our wo  --  Our last Asylum here below ! The body there shall rest in peace , No more to suffer from disease  --  No more to suffer pain or strife , Or any of the ills of life ! Then , what is Death , but our release From this dark life to one of peace ? It is by Death that we are brought Those MIGHTY ONES in Heaven to see  --  Great Sages of immortal thought , And kings of deathless melody ! Who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about The joys divine which they should see In Heaven above eternally ! And how their-unshod feet should tread The MANSIONS of the MIGHTY DEAD , And there enjoy the company Of Angels in that world of bliss , And see the friends they loved in this . For there the faithful here in heart Shall reunite no more to part  --  No more to bow to ruthless fate  --  No more to be disconsolate ; No more to sorrow , weep , or sigh  --  But more than all  --  no more to die ! But those who lie in lowly bed , Call the departed  --  not the dead ! They are not dead who seem to be  --  They only slumber peacefully  --  Waiting the Resurrection Morn , When they shall all be newly born  --  Born of the grave where they now lie  --  Born unto immortality . The Martyr Stephen " fell asleep , " And he for whom poor Mary wept , ( Whose sorrow made poor Martha weep  --  ) Laz'rus , her brother , only " slept ! " We know not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or near ; Though , in our love for them , we say , The dead can not be far away . And though our parting give us pain , Yet , we shall meet in Heaven again ; Wherein our love , when we shall meet , By absence , shall be made more sweet . My Mother long hath trod the path That leads to that Serene Abode , Where I shall meet her after death , Safe in the bosom of our God . The seed , when sepulchered in earth , At the appointed time comes forth , And grows until it comes to bloom  --  Feasting us with its rich perfume ; For therein it is doomed to lie , Until its outer shell doth die , That , dying , it may live beneath  --  For life is but the birth of Death ; And , as the seed thus changed must be , Before the plant Heaven 's light can see , That it may , at th ' appointed hour , Array itself in beauteous flower ; So shall Man 's body from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rise at the Resurrection Day , And put on immortality . Oaky Grove , Ga. , Oct. 18th , 1842 . Chivers , T. H. ( Thomas Holley ) , 1809-1858 : TO MY MOTHER IN HEAVEN . from The lost pleiad ( 1845 ) " They sin who tell us love can die . "  --  Southey . I feel an ardent longing for thy love , A yearning for that Spirit-land above ! A wounded spirit is the one to feel , By suffering , what it is to value weal ! I long to lay me in my resting-place , And cradle me again in thy embrace ; And stay my wounded spirit on thy breast  --  The only one that ever gave me rest ! Thou art the same dear mother to me still  --  The same dear creature , that was wont to fill My heart with unalloyed delight  --  to throw Such sweet enchantment over all my woe ! Though grief has almost driven me to despair , I yet can feel some comfort in the care Which soothed my sorrows with an answering smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Methinks if I had been there by thy side , As others were , that you would not have died ! I sometimes seek thee in the calm of even , By soaring on the wings of thought to Heaven : I look up through the rifted clouds to see If there is anything in Heaven like thee ; I see thee in the noonday-waning moon , And shall be with thee in that Kingdom soon  --  In those far regions of delight where lie The Golden Hills of Immortality . And like the mateless dove , incessantly , I go on tireless wing in search of thee ; But finding nowhere in this world to rest , I come back home again to my sad nest , And utter my lament upon this bough , In pensive languishment , as I do now ! For as the Dove , with her soft wings , will hide The wound that has been bleeding in her side , And , with unmingled feelings of despair , Compress the arrow that is quivering there ; So did my pride , within my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It is most strange that music has the power To call up childhood from its earliest hour : Those words of soft endearment spoke by thee , Worth all the praises in the world to me , Are all respoken by the simplest tone Resembling but an image of thine own : And all those lineaments that once were thine , Are pictured to me as they were , divine  --  As when we occupied whole hours of talk On heavenly things , beside the garden walk ; For there it was , when in my youthful prime , I used to wallow on sweet beds of thyme , And lying there some pleasant afternoon , Would gaze up fondly at the full round moon , Just coming out of heaven , as if to see What holier Moon was watching there by me : For , as that moon her little stars at night , So thou didst lead me to the realms of light , Through all the rich plantations of thy love , More sweet to me than heaven to them above . And all that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that you could die ! I recollect , you used to comb my hair , And part it on my forehead with such care ; And , bending down above me , on your knee , Would say so many precious things to me , And give me oval plums of purple hue , Sweeter than all the fruitage of Meru ; And often , as our friendly talk went on , How often would you call me your " dear son ! " And always , when that tender talk began , I thought if I could only be a man , I would be happier than the day was long , And do such mighty things for thee  --  none wrong  --  Until it seemed , by wishing it to be , I was a man in cold reality . But , since that time  --  before my youth was spent  --  I have had many reasons to lament The wish I made  --  for it was just as vain As now to wish myself a child again ! And then the songs that you would sing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whose melody was like the sweet perfume The violet sheds upon an infant 's tomb ; Which flowed as liquid as a wave that curls Around an island in the Sea of Pearls ; Through which my spirit had the power to see The link that bound you to the Deity . The Hours , as if their wings were made of lead , Have moved on tardily since thou wert dead ! I have forgotten half that might have been , Just from the tardiness of each long scene ! I have been wounded , like the stricken deer Flying from his pursuers in the rear , That has no time to stop upon the way To cool his parching thirst , but , day by day , Forever farther from his covert flies , Through vistas all unknown  --  until he dies ! So does my wounded spirit , from the hounds Of sorrow , traverse earth 's remotest bounds , And flying thence , where deer was never driven , Seek out its covert in the longed-for Heaven ! The very truths which you have taught to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee ! For now there is no mother to beguile My leisure hours , nor comfort me the while ! It is mine orphanage alone can see How much my spirit stands in need of thee ! And thus , while thou art in thy coffin laid , This offering of my love must now be paid , Which flows as freely from my soul to thee , As when the rivers run into the sea ; In order that thy spirit from above May know the depths of mine eternal love ! A few short years , perhaps , may roll around , And I will then be buried in the ground ! But not so with my soul  --  it is divine  --  And shall be happy in that world with thine !

Father ! from thy throne of glory , Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are sorry  --  Hear an orphan in distress ! I have no one now to love me , For my parents both are dead ! Save the One that is above me  --  Will He not sustain my head ? I am here alone in sorrow  --  All my hope on Thee depends  --  And may be , alas ! to-morrow , In this wide world without friends ! For the ones that now protect me , Are but outward friends at best ; And if these should now neglect me , Where on earth shall I find rest ? Oh ! then , rather than to suffer What has been , or is to be , Let thy poor , sad orphan offer Up her dying prayer to Thee ! What my mother had resented , Had she lived , must now be borne ; And her orphan live contented With the scorn that she would scorn ! If their children choose to knock me , I can not return the blow ; And , if told , their parents mock me , And believe not what they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetmeats , all so free ; They then smile to all good wishes , Till they come around to me ! Then they look at me so scornful , As if better ones were nigh ; And it makes me feel so mournful , That I pray to God to die ! And this burthen on my spirit Is so painful now to me , That , Lord ! rather than to bear it , I would freely go to Thee ! Then they say to me as often , That my tears too often flow ; But the reason is , they soften Not their hearts , that it is so ! For the one whose grief commences At her birth , the least offence Is the greatest of offences , Though unfelt by happier sense . For the poor are oft offended By offences none can see But the friendless , who are friended In this world alone by Thee . Thus , the words that would fall lightly On another 's ear , on mine Are like thunders , if , but slightly , They appear to mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left me nothing but his love , That they choose to slight me , rather Than the ones they think more of ! For they go not here by merit , Nor by virtue , but by gold ; And the outward heart they wear it , While the inward one is sold ! And , now , rather than to suffer This unkindness shown to me ; I would freely , Father ! offer Up my dying prayer to Thee ! New York , Sept. 9th , 1840 . Chivers , T. H.
