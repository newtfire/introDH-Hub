One of the main features of President Eisenhower 's plan for improving the nation 's health ( TIME , Jan. 25 ) is more voluntary health insurance . Last week a man with a mountain of figures , based on a sampling survey of U.S. families , told the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce how much of the job voluntary insurance is now doing . <P> In the twelve months ending last June 30 , said Kenneth Williamson of the Health Information Foundation , * the U.S. people paid out $10.2 billion for medical and dental services and goods ( over and above the billions spent by federal , state and local governments ) , and only 15% of it was covered by insurance . The $10.2 billion breakdown : <P> $2billion for hospitals , 50% covered by insurance . <P> $3.8 billion to physicians , 13% covered by insurance . <P> $1.6 billion to dentists , less than 1% covered by insurance . <P> $1.5 billion for medicines and appliances , less than 1% covered by insurance . <P> $1.3 billion for opticians , private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1% covered by insurance . <P> Giving more detail than had the President on medical hardships , Williamson spelled it out : <P> 6,000,000 families had medical expenses totaling 10% to 19% of their income . <P> 3,000,000 had expenses running from 20% to 99% of their income . <P> 500,000 families had medical bills which equaled or exceeded their income . <P> 8,000,000 families had medical debts totaling $1.1 billion . <P> These figures , said Williamson , underline the President 's plea that the insurance plans should offer broader protection , and to more families . One of the hardest hit groups is the aged . Other H.I.F. figures ( for March 1952 ) show that only 26.3% of the U.S. populace over the age of 65 is covered even by hospital insurance . <P> After retirement and as age increases , the insurance coverage falls off rapidly . <P> Concluded Williamson : voluntary insurance can do the job , but " more people need health insurance . Many people need better health insurance . Those persons not now protected are going to be the most difficult to enroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are also those that need it most . " <P> * A nonprofit , fact-gathering group set up in 1949 . Supported by 130 drug and chemical manufacturers , H.I.F. is pledged to do no lobbying , to present its findings impartially.
