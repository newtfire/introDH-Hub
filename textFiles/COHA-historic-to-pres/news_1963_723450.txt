President Kennedy signed an Executive order today that had the effect of halting the draft of married men into the armed forces . The order affects the ' draft status of 340,000 men . The Selective Service System has been drafting an averagei of about 6,000 men for the armed forces each month . About one-third of them have been married men without children . The order Mr. Kennedy signed today places married men , 19 to 26 years old , in the lowest pool of men classified 1-A , or available for the draft . The order is effective immediately . The 1-A pool now contains about 1,700,000 men . Lieut . Gen. Lewis B. Hershey , the Selective Service Director , estimated that ' about 20 per cent of that , total were now married . Enough Bachelors Available Since the remaining unmarried youths are considered numerous enough to fill monthly quotas for the foreseeable future , the effect of the President 's action was to halt the draft of married men . A previous order signed by Mr. Kennedy last March halted the induction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order was announced , Pierre Salinger , the White House press secretary , was asked why so many married men had been drafted each month when plenty of unmarried men were available to fill quotas . " That , " Mr. Salinger said , " is exactly the question the President asked . " The President apparently got no satisfactory answer and the order today resulted . Three Receive Pens Mr. Kennedy signed the order in his office this morning in the presence of General Hershey , Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell L. Gilpatric and Assistant Secretary of Defense Norman S. Paul . The President gave each of them a pen used in the signing . One effect of the order , the iWhite House said , will be to ! lower the age of men inducted each month . The average induction age is about 23 years . Thus , the White House said , young unmarried men will know what their induction status is at an earlier age than they now do . The pool of single men is now considered adequate because the total pool of men 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years as the World War II " war babies " have come of draft age . The order issued today will apply only to men who are mar- ' Tied before they receive an in- " Iduction notice . It described marIried men as those " who have a , ' wife with whom they maintain , a bona fide family relationship in their homes , " As a result of the order , the priority ? of inductions under the new system is as follows " : 1 . Draft delinquents over 19 years old . The White . House did not explain this ? term , which presumably refers to those who hatie illegally avoided induction . 2 . Volunteers for induction under 26 , in the order in which they volunteered . 3 . Nonvolunteers , 19 to 26 , who do . not have wives with whom they maintain bona fide family , relationships in their homes , in order of their dates of birth , the oldest being selected first . 4 . Nonvolunteers , 19 to 26 , who have wives with whom they maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their dates of birth , the oldest being elected first . 5 . Nonvolunteers over 26 , the youngest first . 6 . Men under 19 , the oldest first . Draft calls will be filled under present regulations only from the first four groups . Those inthe first three groups are numerous enough to fill the quotas .
