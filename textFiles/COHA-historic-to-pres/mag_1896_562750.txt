BY DR . H. S. WILLIAMS . PROMINENT among the new " sciences " that have sprung up , mushroom-like , in our generation is " criminology . " Its advocates regard the criminal as a distinct type of the genus homo. *Vith the true spirit of our induction-haunted age , they analyze the delinquent out of all association with his fellows , making him stand apart as a separate order of being . This established to their own satisfaction , they are now searching for lesser subdivisions within the order . And so far has this analysis proceeded that already the criminologist is able to point out typical " murderers " who have never been accused of even attempting homicide , thus dividing the honors as to feats of classification with those other workers who some time since told us of typical inebriates * who had never been intoxicated . The gist of the matter is that if your subject has the head and form of a certain mould he is a typical murderer potentially ; whether he chances ever to live up to his potentialities is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robber , forger , and what not , will follow in due season . All this is very delightful if true . It suggests visions of a golden age , when science shall rule society and by its anticipatory action nip all crimes in the bud by restraining their would-be perpetrators . But with the vision comes also a doubt . One can not help asking himself if the riddle of life is really so near a definite solution as all this would imply . Is the human mind so nnified and invariable an entity that the initiated may read it as an open book ; may not only interpret its present state but predict its future ? One who looks into his own mind and sees what turmoil of tendencies is there would scarce have thought to re*4 so tangibly the mind of unother. // The matter becomes still more puzzling if we consider the question , What is a crime ? For reflection seems to show that crime is not a thing sui generis , but merely the expression of a relation ; the factors being on the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague average status of human action at a given stage of evolution . A certain set of movements constituted the criminal act , but there was nothing intrinsically wrong in the movements . The act itself may not have been inherently wrong . It is the relation of that act to the rights of some other individual , directly or indirectly , that gave the stamp of criminality . Two persons are as essential to a crime as to a quarrel . Acts that militate against the interest of the agent only are called vices , not crimes . Again , deeds stamped as criminal under some circumstances are justified under others . Time was when might made right in the eyes of the most enlightened . Outrageous deeds had sanction of custom and the law among our primitive ancestors . And even now the outrage need only be done on a large enough scale to escape criticism . A highly civilized nation , acting as a unit , may swoop down upon a lesser nation and absorb it against its will without receiving the brand of robber . The deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . Many a man enjoys in honored security a fortune obtained by such means as would have gained him a home in the penitentiary had he taken hnndreds instead of millions . Even so unequivocal a deed as the taking of human life is not intrinsically criminal according to our most advanced standards of thought . The soldier in battle has the lust of a veritable murderer , yet we do not call him by that name . And , under conditions of ordinary living , a man may take the life of another in self-defense and be held guiltless . Nor is accidental homicide , unless contributary carelessness is shown , regarded as a crime . This last illustration suggests that even a consideration of a deed in its relations to the victim is not in itself enough to establish the ethical status of the deed . We must go a step further and inquire why the deed was committed . Unless the perpetrator of the deed acted intentionally , he is at most guilty of criminal carelessness . The assumption is that man is a rational animal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every action . We hold him responsible only so long as he lives up to this assumption . The most ardent criminologist would not , I presume , assert // that his most typical criminal commits crime without a motire . At this stage of the analysis , then , a crime would appear to be a deed by which one person expects to gain personal benefit at the expense of another person or persons . But the slightest reflection shows that this formula is not exact . It is inclusive , but it is not exclusive . The expectation of personal benefit is the great ruling motive back of nearly every human action ; indeed it is in the last analysis the sole fundamental motive to action in the organic world . Hence there is nothing unique or characteristic in this feature of the criminal action , by itself . And undoubtedly a large number of human actions that are considered legitimate and not criminal benefit the actor at the expense of his fellows . For example , the speculations by which most of the large* fortunes of civilized countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element that enters into the essential nature of a crime has yet escaped us . And this essential element is the consideration of the kind or degree of injury that is inflicted on the victim of the crime . The words crime and sin are not synonymous . Sinfulness is fixed in accordance with an absolute standard of ethics , criminality in accordance with a relative or human standard . And as . the social organism is steadily evolving , its standard of ethics is constantly changing ; hence the boundaries of criminal action are forever fluctuating . An accurate descriptive definition of crime therefore becomes impossible . We may modify the partial definition already given by saying that a crime is an act by which one persen expects to gain personal benefit at such expense to another person or persons as society at the moment considers inequitable . But this is only a circumlocution of that practical definition of crime as a wilful violation of human law , which proposition is perhaps as near a satisfactory definition as we can hope to come to . If we understand that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical standards of the social organism at a given time , this definition is sufficiently comprehensive . In view of the fact that we have seen the motive to crime to be a natural and rational one , the essential question in reference to the causation of crime is not why some persons commit crimes , but why all persons do not commit crimes . it is a matter of common experience that every one has desires that if carried ou4 YOL* cL*IIL-No. 477. 14 // would criminally infringe the rights of others . Why are such desires in any given case repressed ? There can be but one reason these desires are subordinated and overcome by other antagonistic desires . Desire is the motive power back of all human action ; and most complicated actions are brought about only after a variety of conflicting desires have been weighed and considered . The higher desires which , being weighed and considered , overcome our criminal desires , are the outgrowth of the gregarious habits of our race . So long as each family existed by and for itself alone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desirability of communal life for mutual protection , and of division of labor for mntual advantage , had become apparent , it must have been equally apparent that these things were not compatible with pure egoism . The spirit of practical Mtruism was born , and the cornerstone of civilization was laid . But this altruistic spirit merely meant , after all , that each individual would consult his own ultimate interest if he sometimes put aside his immediate desires in favor of the desires of others . For example , the barbarian starting out on a hunting expedition sees a very fine bow hanging in front of his neighbor 's tent , and strongly desires to possess it . He starts to take it ; but at once reflects that by so doing he will incur the wrath of the neighbor , who will come forth and in all probability kill him . He desires to live more than to possess the bow ; so the immediate desire is put aside . Such acts of self-denial , being manifestly in the interests of communal advancement , come finally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be right , the opposite acts to be wrong . In time , another motive than fear of the injured one 's wrath comes to be operative in restraining the immediate impulse of the citizen : he fears the disapprobation of all his fellow-citizens , and covets their approval , and the desire for the latter comes finally to be stronger than the desire for his neighbor 's property . But the individual mind always reflects in large measure the aggregate mind , and presently the man who through self-denial has secured the approval of the community comes to take pleasure in his own approval . To do the altruistic thing , even when his neighbors do not know of it , gives him satisfaction , because he feels that he would have the approval of the community if his deed were known . And this egotistic sense of satisfaction bec&amp;mes in time the full-fledged monitor , conscience . How elaborated and dif // 211 ferentiated it becomes in an advanced civilization , how far its general basal outlines are obscured , needs no comment ; but always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lowest , merely an approving consciousness within , representing the sentiment which the individual believes would be voiced by the average mind of his race , could that average intelligence pass judgment on his action . That conscience in the last analysis stands for this and nothing more than this , will not , I apprehend , be disputed . It follows that conscience is purely a matter of education , and that its promptings will represent , at any stage of evolution , merely the average social sentiment of that period . Thus the partially civilized man , whose conscience tells him it would be wrong to surreptitiously take his neighbor 's bow , will not he*itate a moment to take the bow of a member of another tribe than his own , and will even , if he can do so , slip into the tent and kill the owner himself , returning with an approving conscience to meet the approbation and glorification of all his fellow-citizens . His conscience tells him of right and wrong , but it is right and wrong only in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind , nor in the minds of his fellows . I suppose if one were to affirm that the average society of our best civilizations has not advanced as yet much beyond this plane of relative or utilitarian altruism , he would be cried down as a pessimist . Nevetheless one feels forced to venture such an opinion , protesting meantime , however , that he is unreservedly optimistic . But to avoid a controversial attitude , one may waive this point , and claim merely that this utilitarian altruism is the philosophy of a large minority of the race . Such a contention will answer just as well for the present purpose . All will agree that there is a large class in every community whose standards of right and wrong are strictly utilitarian . Whatever they can secure without being detected is fair booty to these unevolved - beings . They regard laws not as representing the average ethical status of their race-such terms having no meaning for thembut as strictly arbitrary human pronunciamentos which are to be evaded if possible , obeyed only if unavoidable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless they fear to do so , or unless a more remote desire gives perfectly tangible promise of greater direct personal benefit . They wiJl steal a hat , for example , unless restrained by the fear of detection , or by the belief that in // 212 waiting they stand a good chance of being able to purloin a coat instead . We say of such persons that they have no moral sense , though the statement is not strictly accurate . They are otherwise known as habitual criminals . " But , " it will perhaps be said , " these are exactly the contentions of the criminologists whom you have all along professed to antagonize . " Thns far , precisely ; but the difference comes now : for the crimnologist holds that these criminals have failed to evolve because their brains were inherently defective . .1 contend that in the great majority of cases they have failed to evolve because they were human and could not rise far above their environment . I have contended that there are good tendencies as well as bad in everybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not inherently so very far apart in a moral way . But it is conceded that the conscience  --  the moral sense-reflects the individual environment . It will further be conceded without argument that the time of plasticity during which conscience is forming is the childhood and adolescent period of the individual . Now , what is the environment in which these habitual criminals are usually reared ? Why , an environment of crime . Jeers and curses are the first sounds to greet the infant 's ears . By example , if not by precept , it is taught that the object of living is to secure as much as possible from one 's fellows with the least possible return ; that sin consists in being found out ; that a successful and undetected crime is the most laudable of acts . Wax to receive , marble to retain , that young mind was graven deep with the lines of wrong living . A subtle poison permeated every cell of its body ; what wonder if it thenceforth gave out none but poisoned thoughts ? It were contrary to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment which counts in moulding us is that with which we come in immediate contact during the formative period of life . The highest thought , the most elevated morals , of any generation are , in a sense , the hot-house cultures of that generation . Just in proportion as they rise above the average understanding and morality of the time , they tend to become unstable . The lower , the more primitive , instincts lie deeper in the grain of the organism . Left to itself , the organism will revert to them as surely as the hot-house plant run wild reverts to its primitive forms . In the one case just as much as in the other , caxeful training is necessary if the best result i8 to be obtained , // The flowers of the human mind do not bloom on human weeds . All education , physical , mental , or moral , is primarily a cultivation of powers of resistance . Incessant attacks are being made upon the organism by environing forces . Disease germs , inclemencies of weather , noxious gases , wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes physically diseased . Cares , anxieties , business and social difficulties , worriments , prey on the mind ; if they are not repelled , insanity results . Natural appetites , long inherent propensities whose gratification is no longer consistent with the existing standards of society , offer alluring temptations ; if these are not resisted , crime is the result . The resistant physical being maintains physical heal*h ; the resistant mental being maintains sanity ; the resistant moral being maintains a high ethical status , so long as the strain put upon it is not too severe . But the most resistant organism , physical , mental , or moral , has its yielding point . Some can stand more strain , some less , but none is absolutely unyielding ; the strongest bridge can bear only a given weight . But manifestly we may guard against breakdown in two radically different ways ; we may strengthen the organism or we may lessen the strain that is put upon it . We guard against physical disease by building up the tissues and selecting a healthful environment . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding pursuits that bring intellectual strain . We may guard against crime by developing the higher ethical sense , and by removing temptations to wrong living . How to do this best is the problem of practical sociology . If this view is correct , the criminal differs from his fellows not so much in inherent depraved tendencies as in defective powers of resistance . The law-abiding individual has or has had many of the same propensities that are patent in the criminal , but they have been corrected , repressed , or even eradicated by the cultivation of higher instincts ; that is , by ethical development . The great practical question is : To what extent is a similar cultivation possible in the ranks from which habitual criminals are recruited ? In reply , I assert , despite the dictum of the criminologist , that there is no known fact to disprove the belief that a considerable degree of such development is always possible ; while abundant data are at hand to prove that a marvelous-. - . // a revolutionizing-degree of such development is often practicable . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the tutorage of those parents and their associates , it will be a criminal almost as a matter of course . There is no need to invoke heredity to explain such a case . But there is every reason to believe that the same child placed amid different surroundings would have grown to a far different maturity . It may be said that since the two experiments can never be tried with the same child , and since no two children are precisely alike , the matter can never be brought to a demonstration ; but , fortunately , as the matter stands , it has been brought near enough a demonstration to convince any candid person . I do not here refer to the thousands of children who are resci*ed each year from the slums of cities , and brought up in institutions from which they finally go out into the world as useful , ethical citizens ; for plainly the objection just noted applies to every one of these , though even here the results reach a moral certainty . I refer to cases in which the rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put in practice . Fortunately there are statistics at hand that prove that even after the plastic period of childhood has been spent in the haunts of vice , after the lower instincts have for a time had full sway , much may still be done in many cases to develop the higher ethical sense upon which depends the resistant power that shall shield from crime . I refer to the records of those institutions of which the Reformatory at Elmira , N. Y. , is the forerunner and the type in this country . There is no more cheering message anywhere for the optimist than the history of this institution as epitomized in its last annual report . It appears , fortunately for the present purpose , that the persons admitted there are tested as to their ethical sense on admission , and the 3tartling result is announced that of " moral sense , even such as shown under examination , either filial affection , sense of shame or personal loss , " almost 40 per cent . have " absolutely none , " and 31 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the heredity of these persons , it is found to average of the very worst , insanity or epilepsy being traced in the ancestry of 12 per cent . of cases , and drunkenness " clearly traced " in 38 per cent. , " doubtful " in 13 per cent . more . The ancestors were " without any educa* // tion " or could " simply read and write " in 44 per cent . of admissions . Here , then , if we went no further , would appear to be most conclusive proof of the overmastering power of heredity , justifying the worst prognostications of the alarmists . But there is another side to the story . These " moral imbeciles " have not only inherited bad tendencies , but they have been reared in such a way as fostered the very worst of them . The character of the homes from which they come is said to be " positively bad " in 54 per cent . of cases , and " fair only " in 38 per cent more . The " character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 55 per cent . of cases , and " not good " in 42 per cent . more . The age on admission of these inmates varies from sixteen to thirty years , 43 per cent . being over twenty . Yet of the entire number 19 per cent . were absolutely illiterate , and 48 per cent . more could " simply read and write with difficulty . " That this deficiency is due to lack of opportunity rather than to inherent deficiency is shown by the fact that only 1.4 per cent . are considered as mentally deficient , 71 per cent . being of " good " natural capacity , and nearly 9 per cent . more of " excellent " capacity . These statistics show the matter in another , and , as the sequel proves , a truer light . For the first time in their lives these moral imbeciles are placed in a healthful envjronment . The resuit is startling . Dormant tendencies for good , now for the first time given opportunity , blossom out surprisingly , and in a few months we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an acute moral sense . Mental and physical training goes hand in hand with the moral , and in due time about eighty per cent . of the prisoners sent there with indeterminate sentences are returned to the outer world , and observation shows that about four-fifths of these become honest bread-winners permanently . More than 2,500 have thus been rescued at this one institution in the past seventeen years , and among these , beyond question , were hundreds that the criminologist would have pronounced hopeless natural criminals . Doubtless there are many respectable citizens of to-day who might when they went to the Reformatory have sat for the criminologist 's picture of a " typical murderer . " There is , I say , no more cheering message for the optimist than // this record of the practical salvation of 2,500 souls . And when we reflect that bad habits spread by contagion , and that each of these reformed individuals would have become , if left to himself , a focus for the diffusion of criminal ideas , the full import of the message is seen to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penal institution in the land has come to be such an ethical factor as this , instead of a nursery of crime , as most of them are to-day , the records of criminology will tell a very different story from the doleful one they now present . If so much can be accomplished with individuals that have developed far on wrong lines before being taken in hand , what may we not expect from younger subjects ? The period of development , and hence of plasticity , in the human species is a long one , but the time of greatest plasticity is the period of infancy and childhood . If the influences that are applied then are bad , the task of supplanting them with good tendencies later on becomes doubly difficult , and there comes a time in the history of every individual when the mind , as it were , crystallizes , and can no longer be moulded . This period comes earlier in some individuals , later in others , but it is almost sure to come to all before maturity . A striking analogy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It is well known that the queen bee ( the mature female ) is developed by a process of forced feeding from a larva that under ordinary circumstances would have produced only a common " worker . " Of the thousands of larvae in the hive , all have the same parentage , and hence precisely the same hereditary tendencies . Every one has the potentialities of a queen , but only in the single one selected by the feeders will these possibilities be realized . A more striking illustration of the power of environment over heredity could not he desired . But in the present connection it is especially to be noted that the higher development can be accomplished only if begun during the infancy of the individual . After the larva has passed a certain stage , no amount of forced feeding will avail to develop it beyond the station of a worker . The same lesson is enforced by consideration of higher animals . It is familiar knowledge that most wild beasts can be tamed only if taken while young , but that then many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birds , because of their very rapid development , furnish most con* // Spicuous illustrations of the transition from a plastic to what I have just termed a crystallized condition of mind . It is said that young wild ducks when they first come from the shell have no fear whatever of a human intruder , but will nestle contentedly in his hand . But after a few hours of maternal tutorage they become so timid and shy that it is almost impossible to capture them , and if taken they show eitreme terror of the being that a few hours before did not at all alarm them . Birds that pass their earlier childhood in a nest do not develop quite so rapidly , but undergo the same transition . A young crow , if taken from the nest during the first week or ten days of its life , becomes the most confiding and amusing of pets , seeming to regard men as beings of its own kind . If a few days later o* another nestling is taken , this one also will become domesticated , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will have something of the suspicious nature of a wild crow . Yet another week or ten days , and the remaining nestlings are able to fly about with their parents and have become altogether irreclaimable . No amount of training will ever suffice to tame them . They are " natural , inherent , hereditary " barbarians , apparently ; but the tame brother , which , if taken to the woods and placed with its fellows , will fly back to the city and seek out its master in preference to crow companions , is a living illustration that a factor other than heredity has been overlooked in such a verdict . I once had a tame crow that followed me often into the field when I went hunting , and have had it sit on my shoulderor perhaps on the gun barrel  --  and caw a welcome to wild crows that flew by , with apparently no more thought of leaving me than my hunting dog had of turning wolf . One might almost rest the case for environment on the evidence of such a single case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower forms of life to apply to man . The day is past when it was supposed that the human mind is intrinsically different in kind from other minds . It is now known that general biological truths apply to each and every member of the organic scale from highest to lowest . The details of application are varied with each species , but the fundamental outlines are the same in all . And in this connection it may not be amiss to note that the human family contains but a single species . // We need not-indeed we cannot-overlook heredity ; but in the light of all these facts is it not wiser to regard each individual vicious little John Doe as the victim of undevelopment , and hence to strive to educate him to a better point of view , than to label him " hereditary criminal " and leave him to the hard fate fortune has originally dealt him ? Practical humanitarians have long since answered this question in the affirmative . They have rescued thousands on thousands of little Does from the surroundings of vice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always easy . Even at the age of five or six years a child has imbibed a host of the ideas that are current in its environment , and these early ideas tend to cling . It may require long and patient training before they can be supplanted . Bat the tet*eher who , given full sway , remembers the biological truth that individual development must be an epitome of racial evolution , will almost surely succeed in timE . with the subject who has not progressed too far in the wrong direction . As the racial conscience - as evidenced in its systems of ethics-has developed along the lines of fear of punishment and love of approbation to a final altruism ; so the individual conscience must be stimulated along these same lines . Gradually , as the mental horizon of the little " moral imbecile " widens , he comes to see the advantages of substituting future welfare for present desire , and when there dawns upon him the consciousness that he is a factor in the body politic , and that his own ultimate good is coincident with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed from the realm of the criminologist , has ceased to be a natural , hereditary criminal , and has entered the ranks of law-abiding citizens . Still being human , he is not invincible . He is not removed from the possibility of crime . But he has acquired an average power of resistance to the temptations of a normal environment , whereas untrained he would have been their ready victim . H. S. WILLIAMS . // BY GEORGE H. LEPPER . IT is scarcely possible that the November elections will result in giving to either of the chief parties to the silver issue the control of all branches of the National Legislature . On the contrary , it seems to be a foregone conclusion that the House and the Senate will be more widely apart than at present on the chief question of the day , and that no legislation on the subject can reach the President so long as the lines remain as now drawn . Such a result would be a victory for the " sound-money " party , inasmuch as no legislation would signify a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly qualified by the fact that some sort of a relief measure has become imperative , and no measure of this character , short of a fall recognition of free coinage of silver , will be countenanced by the Senate . Under these circumstances the horizon shows no sign of breaking clouds . Should the conservatives prevail , what ground have we for hoping that they will succeed better than in the past in the safe and statesmanlike conduct of our financial affairs ? On the other hand , should free coinage at the ratio of 16 to 1 win the day , what can we expect from a theory which holds that arithmetic is a proper subject for legislation-that one dollar can be legislated into two others of equal value ? There remains the plan of securing the co-operation of foreign powers for the establishment of a fixed ratio of coinage between the metals . I can not understand how anyone who has watched the history of the efforts already made toward this object can manage to retain faith in its early realization . We can not wait much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , or union of powers , can see any advantage to itself in such co-operation with us , in view of the possibility of
