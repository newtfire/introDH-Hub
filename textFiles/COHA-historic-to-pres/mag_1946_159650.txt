Odell Shepard is an idealist , a writer , a lover of Connecticut , a wanderer and a teacher . So was Bronson Alcott , hero of Shepard 's Pulitzer Prize biography ( Pedlar 's Progress ) . Alcott was a failure at almost everything he tried ; Shepard has been a success . <P> While footslogging his way over most of the highways &; byways of the Nutmeg State , Odell Shepard has peddled such friendly wares as good talk , homely poetry , corny songs and New Deal politics . He had sold them well enough by 1940 to get elected Lieutenant Governor . Defeated for re-election in 1942 , he resumed the English professorship that he had held for an even 25 years . <P> Last week he " reluctantly " resigned from Hartford 's ( Episcopalian ) Trinity College faculty . Then Trinity 's best-known , most-respected professor , now 61 , put the finger of blame on handsome young ( 35 ) Businessman-President George Keith Funston , one of his ex-students . Shepard charged Funston with refusing to grant him a year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Said he : " I am left with these alternatives : to submit to a ruling reflecting lack of confidence in my veracity . . . OT to resign . " <P> Last October Funston , an ex-radiator manufacturing and WPB executive , took over the 123-year-old college 's presidency . His first businesslike step : to try to take academic control from Trinity 's faculty committees . Shepard , implicitly questioning Funston 's educational know-how , fought the move as " autocratic . " When Funston got the chance to force his outspoken star to resign , he took it . <P> Shepard 's many friends among Trinity alumni promptly bombarded Funston with protest telegrams and letters . But Trinity 's executive committee , all conservative Hartford businessmen , backed up the president . They have long distrusted Shepard 's " radical " notions about banks , utilities and big business .
