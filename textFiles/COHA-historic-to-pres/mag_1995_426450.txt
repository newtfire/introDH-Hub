Controversy surrounds implications of a hybrid label <p> At the tender age of 9 months , Chantek left his mother in Atlanta to live in a trailer next to the music building on the University of Tennessee campus in Chattanooga . There , his surrogate family toilet trained the inquisitive , red-halted youngster and taught him language , how to clean his bedroom , and the deportment necessary to ride in cars , visit parks , and eat burgers at the local fast-food chain . Eventually , this quiet , strapping boy even received an allowance - one he could bank or spend at his discretion on treats . <p> In many ways , Chantek lived much of his first 9 years like any ordinary child in the United States . But Chantek is an orangutan , and his every action and reaction has been recorded and studied as part of an ongoing examination of how these quiet , slow-moving  --  some would say highly intellectual  --  apes think and behave . <p> Acculturation to human society did not prevent Chantek from slipping back into the traditional world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Center in 1986 . Indeed , he fathered a child 3 years later . <p> But this healthy , 18-year-old representative of an endangered species will never sire again  --  at least if internationally recognized primate conservation policies prevail . <p> The reason ? Chantek 's mother hailed from Borneo , his father from Sumatra . That makes Chantek a biological hybrid as well as a cultural one . <p> The American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums ( AZA ) adopted a policy 10 years ago to stop interbreeding Sumatran and Bornean orangutans  --  and to prevent any of AZKs hybrid offspring ( now numbering 51 ) from reproducing . The organization 's 55 member zoos and primate conservation centers with orangutans all adopted the policy , though some " accidental " births did occur through 1991 , observes Lori A. Perkins , a conservation biologist at Zoo Atlanta who coordinates AZA 's species survival plan for orangutans . <p> Four other international umbrella organizations that oversee endangered species management also subscribe to this policy , which now affects the reproduction  --  and status  --  of 192 hybrid orangutans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are intended to represent their wild brethren . Hybrids " do n't have any biological meaning , " observes Zoo Atlanta director Terry Maple , himself an orangutan researcher . " They 're a man-made creation . " <p> In fact , he says , " nobody wants them  --  is n't that a pretty darn good reason not to produce any more ? " <p> Sensitive to their plight , Maple hopes to make his institution a stimulating refuge for hybrids , including Yerkes ' Chantek , who could arrive within a year . <p> A few scientists , however , are challenging AZA 's policy and interpretations of the science underpinning it . Some aired their views in Atlanta last month at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual meeting . <p> At issue , they argue , is not only the fate of these unwanted hybrids in decades to come  --  Chantek , for instance , could live another 40 years  --  but also whether a moratorium on their breeding might jeopardize efforts to preserve the genetic health of future populations of purebred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't go far enough . Even zoos that adhere to AZA 's policy , they point out , might unwittingly be propagating hybrids by mating unrecognized subspecies . <p> Orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus ) once ranged throughout Southeast Asia and well into China . Today , some 15,000 or so live in the imperiled rain forests of Sumatra and Borneo - and nowhere else outside captivity . <p> Throughout most of the 300-plus years that Westerners have captured and studied these primates , all orangutans were treated as one species . Though Borneo 's males tended to develop broader cheek pads and , often , darker hair than Sumatra 's , such physical differences were n't unimpeachable indicators of origin . So zoo managers sometimes accidentally interbred animals from the two islands . <p> Then geneticists got involved . <p> Perkins pegs 1976 as the watershed . That 's when Brazilian researcher Hector N. Seuanez of the Federal UniVersity of Rio de Janeiro and his coworkers published data demonstrating a clear difference between Sumatran and Bornean orangutans  --  an inversion , or consistent rearrangemeat of genetic material , in a region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suggesting that orangutans on the two islands represent distinct subspecies " that had evolved over at least 1,000 generations of separation . " <p> Soon , a debate erupted among orangutah conservators . One side advocated calling a halt to interbreeding . The other side decried this suggestion as racist , arguing instead that the animals constitute a single breed , recalls geneticist Oliver A. Ryder of the Zoological Society of San Diego . <p> Hoping to resolve the dispute with data , a committee overseeing AZA 's species survival plan for orangutans asked Ryder to look at the chromosomes of all these animals in AZA member institutions . <p> The survey , completed in 1985 , showed that orangutans born in the wild carry the same inversion on both copies of chromosome 2  --  an SS pair in Sumatrans , a BB pair in Borneans . Hybrids with wild-born parents carry one of each , or SB . <p> While these inversion patterns provided a marker for wild-born orangutans ' island of origin , they could n't establish how genetically divergent the two groups are . Are the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dissimilar  --  and therefore as unnatural for mating  --  as Sumatran and Siberian tigers ? Or do they represent distinct species , such as the chimpanzee and bonobo ( pygmy chimpanzee ) ? <p> In 1990 , researchers at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick , Md. helped pinpoint the answer , Perkins says . A study led by Stephen J. O'Brien and Dianne N. Janczewski compared several hundred proteins  --  reflecting several hundred genes  --  from Sumatran and Bornean orangutans . <p> It showed that genetic differences between the two kinds of orangutans were 5 to 10 times greater than the differences between the tiger subspecies . <p> Ryder followed up on these data 2 years ago with a report on his chromosome 2 typing for 144 captive orangutans - including 58 born in the wild . He also analyzed variations in the mitochondrial DNA of 14 of the orangutans , including six each from Borneo and Sumatra . <p> Mitochondrial DNA is located outside a cell 's nucleus and is inherited only from the mother . In addition , it mutates more frequently than nuclear DNA . For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct evolutionary trees of relationships within and between species . <p> Together , the two forms of genetic information established that the chromosome 2 inversion distinguishes two taxonomically distinct lines , Ryder says . And the roughly 3 percent variation between Sumatran and Bornean DNA sequences suggests that gene flow between the two islands ended approximately 1.5 million years ago , Ryder and Leona G. Chem-nick conclude in the September-October 1993 JOURNAL OF HEREDITY . <p> Last year , O'Brien and NCI colleague Lu Zhi reported similar findings from their newest orangutan studies  --  also involving mitochondriai DNA . Their data suggested that " the extent of difference between Bornean and Sumatran populations was consistent with species-level divergence . " <p> Case closed ? Not necessarily , according to data unveiled at the AAAS meeting by C. Cam Muir of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver , British Columbia . Muir finds no compelling difference between the mitochondrial DNA of wild Bornean and captive Sumatran orangutans . <p> When he plotted the animals ' genetic trees , Muir found that , rather than occupying different branches , the orangutans shared various limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In contrast to earlier studies , Muir told SCIENCE NEWS , his relies on differences obtained by actually sequencing genes , as opposed to differences inferred from variations in the proteins that genes code for and other indirect data . So presumably , he says , his data may prove a bit better at distinguishing changes . <p> Overall , he believes , " use of the term ' hybrid ' is improper because these are not two species . " <p> That interpretation could change , he concedes , once he has expanded his analy-sis to include more genes  --  including some from the nucleus  --  and several hundred more wild orangutans . <p> But even if Sumatran and Bornean orangutans constitute separate species or subspecies , Muir fears that a ban on crossing them in captivity may dangerously restrict the gene pool , potentially making the animals less fit and more prone to extinction . <p> For populations numbering in the thousands , he says , " there is an advantage to keeping distinct populations separate , because in mixing them you could lose some critical genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once you get below a threshold number and do n't have a full representation of genetic types . " Muir worries that maintaining captive Sumatrans and Borneans separately risks falling below that threshold . <p> Anthropologist Colin R Groves of Australian National University in Canberra worries about a related problem . In analyzing orangutan skulls , he has found bigger differences between those from Borneo 's three geographically isolated groups than between any of those populations and the orangutans in Sumatra . <p> Groves not only agrees that Borneans and Sumatrans are distinct subspecies and should not be interbred , he also says that " eventually , we 'll be proposing that these Bornean populations be formally recognized as subspecies . " <p> The Bornean skull differences he has observed are not visible in living animals . So unless someone finds a genetic marker , he argues , the ongoing repatriation to the wild of recently captured orangutans ( usually from the illegal pet trade ) should be halted or altered . Otherwise , well-intentioned game managers may hybridize animals in the wild . <p> He also argues that zoos and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formatting trace back to the same geographically distinct parent population . <p> " I 've been hearing that speculation about Bornean subspecies for about 5 years , " says who coordinates orangutan breeding in North America . But if it turns out to be true , she told SCIENCE NEWS , " I do n't know what I would do with the information . " <p> Only 82 Bornean orangutans are managed under the AZA program , Perkins notes . Even if roughly equal numbers came from each of the three populations , " I do n't know that it would be smart to subspeciate them , " she says . The number in each group might become too small to ensure a healthy degree of genetic diversity . <p> Moreover , " I 'd have no basis on which to separate them , " she points out , because records of where orangutans were captured are spotty at best . " So our only options now are to just breed them as Borneans or to not breed any Borneans  --  which would send the captive population into a crash from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veterinarian William B. Karesh of the Wildlife Conservation Society , which operates the Bronx Zoo in New York , suspects that Perkins has no reason to worry . He says unpublished genetic data from a study of 50 wild-born orangutans in Asia on which he and O'Brien 's team are collaborating suggest that Borneo 's various populations may have been geographically isolated for a long time  --  at least 250,000 years . And while they do appear to be dividing into subspecies , Karesh says , " they do n't yet qualify , really , as subspecies . " <p> In practical terms , he says , when reintroducing a Bornean captive to the wild , " if you knew where the animal came from , it would be nice to return it to that gene pool . But if you do n't , we 're not really disturbing nature that much . " For zoo animals , which will never return to the wild , the issue becomes even less important , he suspects . <p> Groves disagrees , noting that , at a minimum , the size of orangutans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult male orangs . " Because big males tend to dominate , smaller ones from Borneo 's Malaysian region may not succeed in attracting mates if introduced into the island 's Indonesian southwest , where they would have to compete against bulkier kin . <p> And so the debate rages . <p> What difference does being a crossbreed make ? At the AAAS meeting , several speakers mentioned the fact that some hybrid animals have been sterilized . There were also passing references to the practice of removing hybrids from display and banishing them to the less stimulating environs of a zoo holding cell after the AZA policy went into effect . <p> Such charges spark Perkins ' ire . " We do not stick hybrids in the back of zoos , " she maintains . " They stay in the social groups they 've been in and engage in a complete range of behaviors  --  even copulation . " You Could call every AZA institution in the orangutan program " and they would tell you they do n't keep hybrids any differently . " And , she adds emphatically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinator , they will not . " <p> Perkins concedes that some males have received a vasectomy , which may not prove reversible . But most institutions now rely on timed-release hormone implants to prevent sexually active hybrid females from conceiving . Remove that implant , she notes , " and the females are fertile again . " <p> Even if one subscribes to not mongrelizing purebred populations , hybrids need n't remain childless . Groves suggests sending fertile hybrids to major , responsible zoos that could not otherwise afford orangutans , such as several in India . <p> Ethel Tobach of the American Museum of Natural History has another idea . Many uninhabited Southeast Asian islands are ecologically similar to Borneo and Sumatra . " It would be great to put hybrids on such an island and study them there . " <p> Groves agrees that " if you reintroduce them way outside their known modern range  --  such as in the Malay Peninsula - you can do what you like because there would be no population to disrupt . " <p> But Maple argues that " the only reason we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature is n't making Sumatran-Bornean crosses , " heargues , " why should we ?
