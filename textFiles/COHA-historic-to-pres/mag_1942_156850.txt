On Franklin Roosevelt 's desk , pushed aside during the long weeks of planning the African campaign , lay many an important piece of unfinished domestic business . Last week President Roosevelt studied the problems , called in his advisers , conferred again &; again . In Washington , men whose senses are attuned to administrative earthquakes could feel the ground begin to tremble . <P> Biggest unsolved problem was manpower , growing steadily worse despite dozens of plans , scores of planners , thousands of words of advice , criticism and pious hope before Congressional committees . To the White House went Presidential Adviser Judge Samuel I. Rosenman , whose presence often foreshadows sudden change . To the White House also went Labor 's Philip Murray and William Green . <P> In the President 's hands at week 's end was the most startling plan yet conceived for shaking up the manpower administration . It called for a Cabinet switch such as Franklin Roosevelt has never made before : Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes to become Secretary of Labor in full charge of manpower and Selective Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' old job in Interior , Labor Secretary Fanny Perkins to be shunted aside as Director of the Federal Security Administration . <P> There were other new blueprints drawn up : the President could take his choice . Many an uneasy eye watched the White House for hints and signs of what was coming . At a press conference , a newsman asked Paul McNutt if he expected to stay manpower director ; he answered frankly , " I do n't know . " Fanny Perkins had not even heard of the proposed shakeup until newsmen told her . A spokesman for Harold Ickes insisted that his boss was perfectly satisfied in Interior . <P> But changes-big ones-may be on the way . Urging the President to act quickly were five potent Congressional committee heads , New Dealers all , who wanted the whole war organization overhauled and tightened ( TIME , Nov. 23 ) . Only four weeks away was the inauguration of a new Congress with only a paper majority for the Democratic Party . Franklin Roosevelt knew , and worked in the knowledge , that unless he overhauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <P> <P> Last week the President also : &gt; Was host to Ecuador 's firm , friendly President Carlos Alberto Arroyo del Rio , one of the Americas ' stanchest Good Neighbors . At the White House President Arroyo was guest at a state dinner , remained overnight , discussed long and earnestly with Franklin Roosevelt the prospects for post-war economic unity in the Western Hemisphere . <P> &gt;Administered the final , official rebuke to opponents of nationwide gasoline rationing by ordering Rubber Czar William Jeffers and OPAdministrator Leon Henderson to start rationing this week as planned . <P> &gt; Conferred with some of his Congressional leaders on the molasses-slow progress of the bill he requested for wartime authority to suspend tariff and immigration laws . But at week 's end a rebellious Congress still balked at his request . <P> &gt;Lost an able old White House lieutenant when dour , crafty Charles Michelson , who had taken the skin off scores of Republicans in ten years of speech-ghosting and column writing , decided to retire ( at 74 ) as Democratic publicist.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
