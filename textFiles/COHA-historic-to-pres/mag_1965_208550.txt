Midway through the Grand Prix of Belgium last week , a Ferrari mechanic angrily shook his fist at the public address loudspeakers and exploded with pent-up Italian frustration . " Jeeemy Clark ! " he cried , mimicking the announcer . " Jeeemy Clark ! Always Jeeemy Clark ! " <P> The mechanic 's exasperation was understandable . Jimmy Clark is the most monotonous name heard around auto racing circuits-monotonous , that is , for other racers . In 1963 the Flying Scot won an incredible seven of ten Grand Prix races . Last year he lost the championship to Fellow Briton John Surtees , largely because Clark 's Lotus-Climax racer was plagued by engine bugs . This year Jimmy 's Lotus is healthy , and he has already won two of the season 's first three races to take the lead in the Grand Prix championship . He might have made it three for three except that he passed up the second race-at Monaco last month-for the Indianapolis 500 , where he orbited a Ford-powered Lotus to a record 150.68-m.p.h. average and a record $168,500 prize money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rain . The Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps last week was a relative breeze . Britain 's Graham Hill zipped into the lead at the start , but could not even hold it through the first of 32 laps around the hilly , twisting 8.7-mile circuit . Halfway around , Clark blasted past at 150 m.p.h. on a straightaway , and from then on he simply ran away from the field . Thunderstorms turned the track into something resembling a skating rink . Struggling to keep up , Hill found his B.R.M. sliding all over the road , soon gave up the game and fell back to fourth place . Next , Surtees made a run at Clark , pushing his Ferrari until the engine quit . Half a dozen other cars went out with assorted ills . On the 26th lap , Richard Attwood 's Lotus-B.R.M. hit a shallow puddle , took off like a seaplane , and slammed into a concrete telephone pole . The car was cut in half , and burst into flames . Attwood was thrown clear , received only minor burns . <P> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , " he said . " The rain was starting and stopping all afternoon , and you could n't count on any curve or stretch being the same twice in a row . " At times , he had to hang back for 27 sec. or more before being able to pass a slower car . " I could barely see them for the spray , " he said , " and they could n't see me . " In the end , he still managed to lap everyone except Jackie Stewart , running in second place , and Stewart was 45 sec. or about 1 miles behind when Clark took the checkered flag . <P> The victory was worth only $2,000 , and the rain held his speed to an average 117.16 m.p.h. , far off the 132.79 m.p.h. he posted last year . There was one compensation : it was Clark 's fourth victory in a row at Spa-Francorchamps , and no one had ever done that before .                    @
