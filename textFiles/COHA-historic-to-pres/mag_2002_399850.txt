EDUCATION Ever since July 2001 , when President Bush nominated Kansas City lawyer Gerald Reynolds to head the Education Department 's Office for Civil Rights , Headnote women 's sports advocates have been on guard-Reynolds had no background in education policy but had made a name for himself as an African American who opposed affirmative action . Bush 's recess appointment of Reynolds in March 2002 , bypassing Senate confirmation , signaled serious intent to weaken Title IX enforcement , and in June , the Education Department created Commission on Opportunity in Athletics to review Title IX and report on possible " reforms . " Here 's how to read between the lines of the commission 's report , due in late January . // IN MY FIRST YEAR AT STANFORD , MY basketball teammates and I staged sit-ins in the athletic director 's office . It was 1974 . We were protesting our segregation in the " women 's gym " - so claustrophobic that our 20 fans sat on a single bench between sideline and wall . Our coach was an unpaid graduate student . Our " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we tied red " pinnies . " I came to think of us as the pinney generation . We 'd drop by the athletic director 's office unannounced , insist on meeting with him , and then remind him that Title IX , the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded educational institutions , had passed two years earlier . It was his job to implement it , we informed him . We were angry . We were persistent . We were , I 'm sure , a pain in the neck . We were also successful , at least at Stanford . In my junior year , we moved into " the big gym " ( 7,400-seat Maples Pavilion ) and received paid coaches , uniforms , and a trainer . The year after I graduated , all 12 players were on scholarship . In 1990 and 1992 , Stanford won national women 's basketball titles . And for the past eight years Stanford has won the Sears Cup , awarded to the nation 's best college for women 's and men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " people often ask me , " at how far women 's sports have come ? " They 're thinking of proud , ponytailed soccer players with a spring in their step ; of Venus and Serena Williams , whose bulging shoulder muscles dwarf Martina Navratilova 's ; of the wildly popular WNBA ( " Style . Grace . In Your Face . " ) . They 're recalling the summer of 1999 , when everyone watched Brandi Chastain whip off her shirt in celebration of winning the Women 's World Cup . Actually , since I naively expected that by now women would enjoy an equal share of every " big gym " and every athletic budget , the surprise has been the persistence of inequities . True , female sports participation has increased tremendously since the seventies but look at these numbers : High school boys still receive 1.1 million more opportunities than girls to participate in school-sponsored sports , even though girls ' participation at the high school level has increased from less than 300,000 to almost 3 million . In college , male athletes still receive 58,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men receive $133 million more in athletic scholarship assistance . Coaches lack parity , too . In 2000-01 , the average annual base salary for a women 's coach was $86,119 ; men 's coaches earned $115,586 . That 's a salary gap of nearly $30,000 , or about 35 percent . What has slowed progress ? Athletics directors have dragged their feet about implementing Title IX , often not complying with the law until threatened with legal action . The Office of Civil Rights , which has the power to withhold federal funds from noncompliant institutions , has never done so . In 1984 , the Supreme Court weakened Title IX with a narrow interpretation . Though the law was restored to its full strength with the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 ( over Ronald Reagan 's veto ) , the opposition continues . It 's more subtle than it used to be . Opponents no longer express worry about damage to women 's delicate internal organs , as they did in the late 1800s , nor claim that women lack the endurance to sprint full court , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make women unfeminine , unattractive , or gay , as they did as recently as the 1990s . The twenty-first century argument goes like this : Title IX has " gone too far . " It must be reformed because women 's equality is hurting men . It was Laurie Priest , the athletic director at Mount Holyoke , who pointed out to me that when girls or women are given equal opportunities , boys and men often feel discriminated against . They 're so used to enjoying privilege , preference , and priority access to that big gym , they sometimes feel that 5050 is unfair . In the case of Title IX , many men believe they have tangible " proof " that female equality makes men suffer : some athletic departments have reached parity not by adding opportunities for female athletes , but by subtracting opportunities for male athletes . Players and coaches whose programs have been cut are crying foul . So the federal government is " reviewing " Title IX . GROUNDWORK FOR ' REFORM ' Last June , U.S. Secretary of Education Roderick Paige announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he testified before the Senate that month , Paige seemed enthusiastic about Title IX , calling it " landmark legislation " and " one of our most important civil rights laws . " He gave the law credit for an 847 percent increase in girls ' high school sports opportunities since 1971 . Paige also praised increases in the number of women in medicine , dentistry , and law . ( Title IX applies to all aspects of education , including admissions , recruitment , course offerings , counseling , financial assistance , student health , insurance benefits , housing , marital and parental student status , harassment , educational programs and activities , employment , and physical education and athletics . ) The administration , Paige promised , is " working to build on these successes . " The commission 's stated purpose is " to study Title IX and recommend how and if it should be revised . " Co-chaired by Stanford athletic director Ted Leland and former WNBA star Cynthia Cooper , the commission includes Julie Foudy , Women 's Sports Foundation president and captain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Olympic gold medalist and chair of the United States Olympic Government Relations Committee ; and athletic directors , commissioners , professors , coaches , university presidents , and executives with a range of views on and familiarity with Title IX . Hearings were set up in six cities across the country . National Women 's Law Center co-president Marcia Greenberger , testifying at the first hearing , which was held in Atlanta in August , made a strong case for vigorous enforcement of current Title IX policies . The commission report is due to be released at the end of January . Photograph The number of NCAA schools where women play soccer has burgeoned from 80 schools during 1981-82 to 811 schools by 1999-2000-a tenfold increase . // Having lived through three decades of resistance to Title IX , women 's sports advocates are wary . The commission represents " an under-the-radar assault by the Bush administration , " says Martha Burk , chair of the National Council of Women 's Organizations , which represents 160 organizations with a collective membership of seven million . " A frontal attack would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dads are for Title IX , and they carry a lot of weight . " " The very fact that they must praise it before they kill it is a testament to the popularity of women 's sports , " says Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation . " They ca n't oppose it on academic grounds , either-there are too many female doctors and lawyers . They ca n't win in the courts . They 've tried that and lost . So their only chance is to change the regulations . " And that 's the new wrinkle . In the past , athletic directors tried unsuccessfully to protect male entitlement by defending their schools against legal challenges brought under Title IX . The new tactic is to go after the Education Department itself for its guidelines for complying with the law . The three current objections are : 1 . In order to comply with the law , schools are eliminating men 's sports , thus discriminating against boys and men . 2 . The enforcement regulations establish a quota system . 3 . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men do anyway . ARE MEN BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ? According to the National Wrestling Coaches Association ( NWCA ) , 350 wrestling programs have been cut since the passage of Title IX . Last January , the NWCA , joined by the College Sports Council and others , filed a lawsuit , charging that the Education Department 's Office of Civil Rights has enforced Title IX in a way that constitutes discrimination against men in low-profile sports . The Education Department has moved to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that the court does not have jurisdiction to consider the case ; nonetheless , it is preparing a review of its Title IX guidelines . Aware of the wrestling cuts , House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert , a Republican and former high school wrestling coach who has publicly bemoaned the " unintended consequence " of Title IX ( the elimination of men 's programs ) , had called for a General Accounting Office investigation . The GAO report , issued in March 2001 , showed that in the 1998- ' 99 season , 162,783 women and 231,866 men were playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut , others were being added , resulting in a net gain of 36 men 's teams between 1982 and 1999 , not a loss . Overall , male sports participation is increasing , not decreasing . Also , in the 20-year span beginning in 1981 , for every two sports opportunities added for women , 1.5 were added for men ( 82,000 were added for women ; 52,735 for men ) . There were 156,131 men playing college sports in 1981 , about the same as the number of female athletes today . So if men 's sports opportunities had been held steady while bringing women up to speed , universities would not now be in the position of robbing Peter to play Paula , so to speak . Schools have to make tough financial choices . In the 1970s , most college enrollment was 65 percent male . Today , women students are in the majority , at about 54 percent . When colleges are n't able to raise additional revenue to fund the new women 's programs that they need either to balance growth in men 's sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are forced to borrow from other line items in the budget . The obvious fat to trim would be football-especially in big schools at Division 1-A level , with 85 football scholarships and vast coaching staffs with salaries that can exceed those of university presidents . ( To put that number in context , National Football League teams carry only 53 active players ) Eighty-three percent of athletic directors are men , and many of them are former football coaches . So to save the sacred bull of football , athletic directors look for other sources of moneyand sometimes do cut wrestling to pay for field hockey . WHAT ABOUT ' THE QUOTA THING ' ? Does Title IX constitute a quota ? All eight federal courts that ruled on Title IX in the past 20 years have agreed : No . Nancy Hogshead , a 1984 Olympic swimming champion , assistant law professor , and founder and chair of the Florida Coastal School of Law Legal Advocacy Center for Women in Sports , explains that the guidelines for interpreting Title IX " give schools broad flexibility to choose between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports participation opportunities . " Schools can either show that the athletic department 's gender mix matches its general student body population , or that the institution has a history and continuing practice of expansion for women 's athletics , or that it is meeting the interests and abilities of the female athletes on campus , " Hogshead says . She emphasizes : " There 's simply no quota involved . " WOMEN DO N'T WANT Photograph Women 's crew is a popular beneficiary of Title IX , and big women's-crew rosters help schools balance football . Some schools save money by cutting men 's wrestling . // TO PLAY SPORTS ? It is that third part of what 's known as the " three-part test " - the " interests and abilities " phrase-that seems to render Title IX most vulnerable . When all else fails , Title IX opponents claim that women do n't really care much about sports anyway . In several lawsuits , schools have tried unsuccessfully to contend that the athletic " interests and abilities " of their female students are already being met-with proportionally fewer opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pursuing this same line of reasoning . The Education Department 's Web site offers an informational Q &A; that includes this apparently frequently asked question : " Is n't this commission just a way for the Administration to roll back the rights of female athletes because a few men are complaining that their programs have been cut ? " The answer they post on the site hints at a possible outcome : " No . For at least a decade , schools have requested additional guidance on how to assess the interest and abilities of their students . The Commission may choose to identify , among other things , methods that can be used to assess the interest and abilities of students . The Department seeks an approach that allows schools to structure their athletics programs to meet the needs and goals of the school and its students , in a nondiscriminatory manner consistent with the requirements of Title IX . " These " methods used to assess the interests and abilities of students " would probably consist of a survey instrument " that would take us back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Fame softball player and executive director of the Women 's Sports Foundation . " It 's like saying we should survey how interested women are in math- then limit their opportunities according to the survey . It 's just crazy , " Lopiano says . " Besides , there are less than 400,000 participation slots in college altogether . How can they possibly meet the interests and abilities of the six million high school girls and boys who might want to play college sports ? To claim that they 're already doing so is ludicrous . " " Women are n't very athletic " is an antique argument , frayed from centuries of use , so I was surprised to hear Jessica Gavora make it . She 's a former high school basketball player who says she learned through basketball how to work hard , how to handle success and failure , how to be a team player , and how to cherish physical fitness . " I would not have been happy in a world that forced me to be a dancer or a cheerleader when I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her recent book , Tilting the Playing Fields : Schools , Sports , Sex , and Title IX , Gavora calls Title IX a quota and claims it discriminates against boys and men . A senior policy advisor for the U.S. Department of Justice and also Attorney General John Ashcroft 's chief speechwriter , Gavora cites Brown University 's research to make her case . While spending millions of dollars unsuccessfully defending itself against a suit brought by its female students , Brown presented surveys showing that the ratio of female to male varsity athletes at Brown-40 to 60 percentmatched the interest levels among female and male Brown students . The judge who ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in 1991 rejected the university 's claim that Brown 's female students care less about sports , also rejecting Brown 's claims that Title IX constituted a quota and that implementing Title IX would require a drastic reduction of the men 's program . The Supreme Court let the lower court 's decision stand . " We need an end to the recent rhetoric that implies that equality for women results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes are n't as interested in playing sports as their male counterparts , " says pioneering women 's sports activist and tennis champion Billie Jean King . " These are anachronistic and stereotypical views that are contrary to reality . " BEHIND THE RESISTANCE : THE ULTIMATE ARGUMENT Why are we still arguing about this ? Why is there no end in sight to a 30year-long debate over whether women should have equal opportunities on America 's playing fields ? Because sports are not just sports . Sports are a battle , men often say . Sports are not a battle . But they 're not just fun and games , either . The more women play sports , the healthier and stronger they become . Physical fitness improves self-esteem and mood , lowers anxiety and depression , reduces stress . Women who play sports are less likely to suffer from breast cancer , osteoporosis , heart failure . High school athletes have lower rates of drug use and pregnancy . They feel better about their bodies . Sports radically transform women emotionally , as well . The more women play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves , team up with other women , and perhaps also refuse to tolerate abuse , whether that 's sexual harassment at work or battering at home . The more women gain physical and emotional strength , the less feasible it is for men to treat women as inferior . And maybe it 's this-the growing strength , confidence , and teamwork among women , and the shifting balance of power between women and men-that makes Title IX an emotional issue , and upsets some people even more than the loss of a few wrestling programs . When I was on tour for my book , The Stronger Women Get , The More Men Love Football , I kept hearing the word " different . " During arguments about female power , potential , and purpose , after I " won " with statistics , facts , and reason , my opponents would resort to , " But men and women are different ! " Having heard this literally hundreds of times , in innumerable variations involving brains , muscles , height , weight , genitals , nurturance , combativeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have concluded that this is the emotional core of the opposition to Title IX , and to women 's growing physical and political strength . Title IX opponents want men and women to be fundamentally , essentially different from each other . They want men to be stronger . To be more privileged . To be on top . Feminism challenges that assumption-saying , in effect : sure there are a few differences , but we can all be doctors , nurses , pilots , presidents , soccer players , synchronized swimmers , and soldiers , with the full range of emotions and behaviors to choose from . We need not restrict ourselves to genderstereotyped games . I think this perspective scares some people . What if women did n't have to dress , talk , work , parent , and play sports " like women " ? What if they could behave any way they pleased ? What if men could ? ANTICIPATING THE COA REPORT In January , the commission will issue its report on the investigations into Title IX to Secretary Paige , who " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any decisions on how to proceed , " according to the Education Department 's Web site ( www.ed.gov ) . True , at least one man on the commission is a former wrestler , yet with women 's sports advocates Donna de Varona and Julie Foudy there also , it 's impossible to conceive of a unanimous proposal that would hurt women 's sports . But the commission is only making recommendations , not decisions . Could the Bush administration rewrite the regulations based on an assertion that women do n't really care about sports as much as men do ? Sure they could . What 's the worst that could happen ? " Everything that we 've worked for could be over , " says Hogshead , the swimmer and lawyer . " They could tell schools that it 's O.K. to give women fewer opportunities because they 're less interested in sports . " They could send us back to the " women 's gym .
