George Allen , the new Ram head coach kidnaped from the Chicago Bears , has made a number of unusual investments in behalf of his new owner , Dan Reeves , who was once head of a Los Angeles brokerage firm . In the past the Rams have been notorious for trading players for draft choices . Often these trades succeeded in disposing of players who were on the verge of stardom ( Night Train Lane , Andy Robustelli , Tom Keane , Big Daddy Lipscomb ) or established stars ( Norman Van Brocklin is the prime example ) for rookies who proved to be far less valuable than the players traded . This year , at Allen 's behest , the Rams have traded draft choices for players . // " I want to win now , " says Allen , a young , intense man who has been recognized as a defensive genius for a long time . ( The Bear team which won the league championship on defense in 1963 awarded the championship game ball to Allen. ) // Allen has a store of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squad . Each pen is inscribed with the player 's name and the word NOW . " I 'm not building for the future , " Allen says . " I like bald heads and gray hair on the squad . I want some men with polish and know-how . You have to have them to win . " // Under his policy of trading for experience , Allen has made the Rams a much better club . For example , he has acquired veteran Halfback Tom Moore from the Green Bay Packers to jolt the anemic Ram rushing . The Rams suffered from a lack of authoritative linebackers last year , so Allen traded a draft choice for veteran Myron Pottios of Pittsburgh , two second-line players for Philadelphia 's Max Baughan , then talked Bill George of the Bears and Jack Pardee of Texas A&amp;M 's coaching staff , formerly a Ram linebacker , into returning to action for one more year . Now the Rams , with seven first-rate linebackers , have an embarrassment of talent at a position where they had been woeful . // Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' first 10 draft selections for next season , and has done so with such skill that he has : 1 ) bolstered a weak running attack , 2 ) rebuilt the linebacking corps , 3 ) added depth to his defense line , 4 ) strengthened his defensive backfield and 5 ) engendered a spirit of immediacy that has supplanted the Rams ' habitual disposition to wait until next year . Allen 's free use of draft choices as trade bait was partly dictated by the fact that the NFL and AFL will have a common draft next January . With 26 teams , instead of 15 , making choices , every club 's draft will be diluted . // In Roman Gabriel and Bill Munson , Allen has two enormously capable quarterbacks . He will probably go with Gabriel , the veteran who led the Rams through a good second half of the 1965 season , although Munson is potentially the better of the two . Even with the addition of Green Bay 's Moore , Allen could use more ball carriers , although a lighter Pen Wilson ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better striking power from the fullback position . The Rams also need another good , fast deep receiver . Bucky Pope is injured and Tommy McDonald , as agile and accomplished as he is , can not carry the load alone . The offensive line is sound and capable , if not up to the Green Bay standard . Allen suffered a serious loss at tight end when Marlin McKeever , one of the best in the league , was injured in a freak automobile accident . He lost the ring finger of his right hand . The forefinger was damaged as well , and McKeever is out for half of the season , possibly longer . // The Ram defensive line  --  Ends Lamar Lundy and Dave Jones and Tackles Rosey Grier and Merlin Olsen  --  probably is the best in all pro football . With Green Bay 's Willie Davis , Jones is one of the two most accomplished defensive ends , and the rest of the line is close to him in quality . With the new linebackers to free them for a more daring style of play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ram secondary also should be far better than it was in 1965 , when it was handicapped by a lack of short-range coverage by the linebackers . Irv Cross , traded from the Eagles , has moved into the one secondary position  --  right corner back  --  where the Rams were weak . // It is doubtful that Allen , in his first year as coach of the Rams , can come close to claiming the kind of surprise championship that his 1963 defensive team made possible in Chicago , when the Bears gave up only 10 points a game . In today 's even tougher Western Conference the Rams will not hold such teams as the 49ers , Packers , Colts and Vikings to so meager a point production . // And without an offense to match those of the leading contenders , the Rams will have to depend far too much on that defense . Even with the gold pens reading NOW the defense wo n't be able to record enough shutouts for a Western championship . But the Rams could move up to fourth , a significant achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
