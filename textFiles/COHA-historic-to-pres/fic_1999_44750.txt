" The war will be over by Christmas . " - Famous last words Headnote In Flanders fields <p> IF HE SURVIVED THE NIGHT , tomorrow would be his fourth Christmas Day in the trenches . He had survived three Christmases in this purgatory of mud and noise and blood they called the Western Front . Three ice-cold Christmas . Eves , three frozen Christmas mornings . Surely he could manage to live long enough to mark one more anniversary of the birth of the Prince of Peace ? Already he had outlived his two brothers , his best friend , and half his classmates at Trinity . He had even outlived his youngest sister . Lily had been a VAD nurse ; sacrosanct . A nine-inch shell had killed her and taken half a field hospital ward with her . That had been last spring , just before the brief cease-fire that had celebrated Easter . Simon firmly closed away the memories of the endless dead and he tried desperately to forget the count of his survival . It was bad luck . Instead , he bent once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . A Christmas star ; a beacon to mark the turn of another frozen year . For this year , this dead Christmas of 1917 , there was to be a tree . Somewhere in the mud and despair in which they existed , Sergeant Bunter had found - no one had dared ask how - a holly tree . More of a bush , really , if one were honest , and a bush more dead than alive at that . But some of the holly leaves still greweth green " And parts of it are excellent , " as Peter had gleefully re ; marked upon confrontation with the wretched object . " So they are , " Simon had said , and , " Well done , Sergeant . " And so for once they would keep a proper Christmas . Each man of Simon 's squad had been told off to produce a suitable ornament for the miraculous tree " No questions asked or answered , " Peter had carolled , and then giggled in a girlish fashion that would once have appalled Simon . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walking dead . Peter had come to France only two months ago , arriving at Simon 's hard-won section of the trenches on November First " All Saints Day , " the newcomer had informed Simon , and handed him the paperwork without which Those Above thought the war could be neither fought nor won . " But I 'm no ghost , I assure you , " he had added with a too-clear-eyed glance around the room Simon 's men had dug deep into the mud of France . That gay defiance was true no longer ; eight weeks of hunger and cold , mortar barrages and fleas , sickness and stench , had begun the rot . Peter 's first go Over the Top had completed his destruction . Untouched himself , Peter had - as Simon 's letter of dutiful commendation had phrased it " nobly and without thought of his own safety killed two of the enemy and carried Private Mellors back to the safety of our own lines . " Or , in plain English , Peter had ripped the throats out of two German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged a screaming man across one hundred yards of shell-poxed dirt , leaving a trail of blood and flesh behind . The C.O. had put Peter in for a medal . Private Mellors had died five minutes after being tumbled into their own trench . And all that was left of Peter was a pleasantly witty ghost . Do n't think , Simon reminded himself , and picked up another . A silver star , bright and false as hope . A star created of bully beef tins clumsily banged into hammered brightness with the butt of a Webley service revolver . When it was finished , he would wait until Christmas morning dawned , and then he would tie the star to the top of the half-dead holly tree . And celebrate his fourth Christmas spent in the mud and ice of this trench near what was left of Cambrai , France . The poppies blow Another day over and done with . At first she had tried to keep count , but now she could no longer remember how long she had been here . Nearly a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard some of the older women whispering that it was Hanukkah again next week . She did n't know how they knew that . All she knew was that the days were now short and cold instead of long and hot . And that there was less food ; less even than the little there had been before , when it was too hot . Nearly a year , and that only because she was lucky . The fortunate one ; the family 's golden girl . She had been the fair twin , and Hannah the darker sister . And so Hannah had been sent to one line , and she to another . Because her hair was blonde . A mitzvah , some of the women here had told her . She was still alive ; be happy . " No ! No , I want to go with my sister ! " Her own voice screaming , and her arms clinging , and then her fingers , and Hannah being ripped away inch by inch , until she held only one of Hannah 's bright red mittens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her family , only she was left , to endure . And wait until the day she did n't pass inspection ; did n't meet whatever arbitrary standard held that inevitable day . Then she too would be gone , like Hannah , and Mama and Papa and her little brothers . David had been a big boy of six . But Saul had only just learned to walk . Only a baby . Judith shifted on the narrow bunk and pried her only remaining treasure from its hiding place between the wooden slats . She must n't think ; she would n't think , or she would go mad . She would use her talisman ; she would fly beyond this place of cold and filth and the stench of long-unwashed female bodies . She would use her star . The metal star filled her hand with memories . Papa had brought the simple ornament home from his war , the Great One . " I found it when we took a trench from the enemy - that was not an easy thing , you know , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had always demanded to know what the star had been doing halfburied in bloody mud , what it was for . Papa had looked at her strangely , then . " It is what stars are always for , Judith . It is for hope . " The star had waited in the velvet-lined box with Papa 's medal for valiant service as a German infantryman . When the family had been told to pack - only one suitcase each , and be sure to label it neatly- Judith had remembered the medal , and the star . And when they had been told to leave their suitcases , she had hastily taken out both medal and star and tucked them securely into her coat pocket . She no longer owned her father 's medal for valorous service to the Fatherland . It had been silver ; it had been confiscated by the first guard who had pawed her . But the star " Nothing but an old piece of tin . " The guard had tried to toss away the star , but she had been unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the star out of her rigid fingers , he had looked at her again , and then glanced around the crowded station platform , canny as a fox . " A kiss , and you can keep it . " Unable to lose the star when she had already lost so much , Judith had lifted her mouth , mute and frozen , and paid for the old tin star with a rapine kiss . " You ca n't be a real Jew , " the guard had said afterwards , staring covetously at the golden hair that had saved her for the iron mercy of a work camp . Such a little thing , to save a life . Had her hair been brown , like her sister 's , she too would have climbed into a crowded boxcar , and been gone . Sent to one of the konzentrationslager .... Her hair did not shine so brightly now ; the gold was tarnished with grease and filth . She could not remember when last she had been clean . " But you LIVE , liebchen . Live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mama , who had grabbed Hannah away and held her fast in that other line , and called " Go , Judith . Go - " Now Judith turned the little tin star over and over in her hands . The star flashed in the dimming light from the bare bulb far overhead . If she stared far enough into its silvery light , she could pretend she was n't here . Pretend that someday this might be over , and she might even survive . But someday was as far away as tomorrow , or as near as all eternity . She had learned to lock out reality , to focus only on the star 's bright inner dream , to forget place and cold and fear and hunger . She had already forgotten the passage of time . It was not important . Time held very little meaning in hell . Between the crosses PROPOSITION A YEAR was n't such a long time . Not really . Not when properly calculated . A year held only 8,760 hours , and he 'd already survived 2,400 of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home A shadow loomed over him . " Christmas speech at 1800 hours , boy . You come now , you hear ? " Jeff did n't look up ; what was the point ? " Sure . " After a pause , he added . " Thanks . " He no longer bothered to object to Roy Slattery 's mode of address . Why make a federal case out of something that had ceased to matter ? Like the rest of them , Roy was doing the best he could with what he had left . Second Lieutenant Slattery had been a good ol " redneck boy once . That had been six months ago , when he 'd been fresh meat right off the plane from L.A. A lifetime 's endurance ago . Now something lived in Roy Slattery 's pale eyes that it was n't good to see . That it was n't safe to see . No one looked into anyone 's eyes here . Like counting the days left until rotation out , it simply was n't done . It was n't safe . " Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , waiting . " The party , " Roy said . " We need ornaments for the Christmas tree . " " It 's a palm tree , Lieutenant . I do n't think you can decorate them . " Jeff spoke as gently as possible to keep from either slugging Roy or bursting into tears . A Christmas tree , here in the mud and blood and insanity that was Firebase Alpha , Quang Lai , South Vietnam . How crazy could you get ? But they all knew the answer to that , so nobody asked the question . Just like nobody asked what they were doing here , trapped in a country where their alleged allies were petty tyrants to a man , and where all the average Vietnamese peasant wanted was to be left alone and get his rice crop in . And not get killed by either side for his own political good .... " The tree , boy . " Roy 's hominy-grits drawl , his Deep South prejudices , had been irritants once . Now Roy 's drawl was flattened , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year out of time , all lesser fears and and dangers were subsumed in the simple need to survive another day , another hour . Even another minute mattered . While we pretend we 're normal . That this life is normal . That the United States Armed Forces were n't mired in the middle of the most unwinnable military disaster since the Peloponnesian Wars . That the American soldiers were n't really nothing but a pack of scared kids who could n't believe they were really stuck here with the bugs and the mud and the adorable golden-skinned children with live grenades strapped to their scrawny chests . According to the news clippings sent from home , they were winning the war . Must win , no matter how many twenty-year-old boys never saw or walked again . No matter how many trees or children burned Endless pretense , filtering down from the highest levels like poison silt . A random statistic slithered through Roy 's mind : thirty-eight species of snake dwelt in the jungles of South Vietnam . Thirty-seven of them were venomous . Roy stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pretend we 're still alive . " Yeah , I 've got something , " Jeff said at last , and shook his dog-tag chain . " How about this ? " The tin-can star chinked against his tags . It was old , and bore the dentmarks of long service . But it was still a silver star , and could certainly do emergency duty as a Christmas-tree ornament . " Just a loan for the Christmas tree . I 'll want it back . " The star had been one of his dad 's souvenirs from the ETO in the last big one . Dad had found it in one of the camps . When Jeff had been posted to Vietnam , Dad had given him the star - " For luck , son . And for remembrance . " " Thanks , boy . Bring it to the cook-tent at 1700 . " And Second Lieutenant Roy Slattery wandered off across the planks pretending to be dry pathways through the mud . Jeff did n't bother to watch him slog off through the ankle-deep mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright against the darkness of his hands . Too bright . Bright like Christmas lights , and Boston streets where snow fell white and icy cold . Where the lights of the bookstores cast shadows on the snow It was n't good to think about home ; it was a dangerous distraction . Perhaps it was n't good to look into the time-battered surface of the star , either . For there he could look into his own eyes , and know that what waited in Roy 's eyes waited in his as well Slowly , he spun the star and the blurred image of his face vanished . Thinking like that was stupid ; thinking like that would get you killed . There was nothing waiting . Nothing but mud and sweat and blood , and one foot placed carefully in front of the other , step by step , until you at last reached peace . 6,359 hours to go A ragged edge of one of the star 's points caught his thumb , left a thin red line tracing his skin . Fastidious , Jeff held the cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow 's Christmas tree ; you did n't want blood marring a Christmas star . Not even here . It was bad luck . Row on row The crisis would be over any day now - they said so every hour on the newscasts . They said it real calm , and cool , and convincing . They 'd been saying it that way for almost three weeks . Ever since the assassination . The killing had happened someplace foreign . Someplace unimportant . Someplace she 'd never even heard of before . Neither had anyone else she knew . But now it was someplace vital . Someplace where violence simmered like a poison soup , ready to boil over the edges of the pot , spilling and burning Sofie shook her head to drive the image out , but the pictures in her mind refused to vanish . All those bright TV shows of troops heading off into nowhere , all of them young and motivated and waving at the newscameras . Reports of tactical strength , repeated over and over , like wishing would make it so . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it is . So what if they were fighting somewhere ? They were always fighting somewhere , like they could n't stop ; like a string of real big family feuds . This was only another local disturbance . Nothing to worry about . They said so on the news every day . Just remember to have a good supply of canned food on hand . And bottled water and basic first aid supplies . Please stay off the streets if possible . And stay tuned to your local station A dutiful citizen all her life , Sofie obediently stockpiled food and water and blankets , and kept the TV turned to CNN , and tried not to worry . Just like they told you , over and over , on all the newscasts . But soundbites stalked her as she paced from room to room . " Embargo ... Advancing rebel troops ... Possible cease-fire ... U.N . mediators ... President 's message ... Resolved to settle the conflict before .... " Restless , she checked and rechecked her supplies of food , of clothing , of medicines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do we have all those troops of ours on their way over there FOR , anyway ? She frowned ; had n't they already had some troops over there ? Before all this ? She could n't remember , and none of the news stories mentioned it . She needed something to do ; something cheerful . Something to take her mind off those newscasters and their smooth unreassuring voices . The kids were coming tomorrow , bringing their own kids to Grandma 's for the holidays . So why did n't she haul down the box of holiday pretties and hang them in the windows now ? Decorating the house windows was a family tradition . Just like the old tin star Sojie lifted out of the box of holiday ornaments was a tradition . The metal star was old , and not all that pretty , really . But her own mother had found it a long time back . Way back , just before she 'd been plucked safely from a place whose horrors Sojie could n't even imagine and airlifted out with a hundred other orphans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in Vietnam . She was an American now , she 'd said , and anyway , she did n't remember ; she 'd only been a very little girl .... But her mother had always kept the star she 'd picked out of a pool of mud and bones so long ago . And each year her mother 's lucky star held the place of honor during the holidays . " To remind me how fortunate I am , " her mother had said once , when Sojie 's husband had asked why they hung such a battered thing up as a Christmas ornament . Now the star dangled from Sojie 's fingers , turned slowly on its twist of red ribbon , glowed dull silver in the TV 's constant light . It was odd , but the star never looked really clean , somehow . And this year it seemed like darkness etched every crevice , and there were shadows on the metal . But the star was traditional . And tradition was important , especially for the kids . Sojie stood up and walked into the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room window , just the way she always did . Because this year was no different than any other And now that she came to look , it was the old ribbon wound around the star that was the trouble . That was why the star seemed to look so ugly this year- that shabby ribbon , all wom and faded and hardly red at all any more . " The government asks that any Reservists who have not yet reported please - " Yeah . That was it . After the holidays , when the crisis was over , then she 'd replace the red ribbon . That mark our place .... Thirteen was the lucky number . You made thirteen patrols , you got recycled to Admin . That 's what they told us , anyway . Thirteen , and out . I 'd done four already But it was bad luck to count them . Just keep your mind focused on today and your sensors primed . Four , and today would tally five They said some had lived to walk all thirteen . I knew someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least was quiet . Hard to be anything else , when there 's nothing around but you and a lot of flat asphalt and a bunch of flaking ruins . Oh , yeah , and the enemy . Whoever it is this week . We covered the ruins on the morning stomp . I do n't know what they are , but you find them all over the place ; Rissa , our platoon brain , says they 're supposed to be some weird old stores or museums or something like that . Maybe they were , but they are n't much to look at now . Mostly rubble , and sometimes a lot of plastic flows and heaps of metal . Sometimes there 's a standing wall . Mostly there is n't , which is better . After the ruins , we got a break . Guess who got posted picket ? And I did n't even volunteer , neither . I know better than that . So I stood at the edge of what I guess was a wall a long time ago and kept my sensors turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was just scuffing my foot in the dirt , ignoring the shadows burned into the wall I was walking . You learn never to look at the shadows . It 's bad luck . My boot bumped something harder than dirt and I looked down and there it was , shining like a new-issue gun before you oiled it dark . I crouched down and dug it out of the dirt - yeah , real bright . The thing could 've been an anti-personnel device or worse . But I was sick of seeing all that battered brown that seemed to go on forever all around us . And something seemed to whisper , how could dying quick be worse than this ... ? It 's too easy to get sort of sideways out here . Anyway , the bright thing did n't blow , and came away from the dirt easy , sort of like it wanted me to pick it up . Like it wanted me - which just shows I 'd been in the field a little too long and was maybe one private short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken that kind of damnfool risk to get . Turned out to be a battered star made out of some kind of silvery metal , the kind of star with five points . Dark stuff crusted in the cracks where metal 'd been folded over . Maybe someone 'd painted the thing once . I brushed the dirt off the star . The wind picked up , and the dust blew past , and sunlight bounced off the metal star . The light made the burnshadows dance on the ruined wall , like ghosts waiting to walk Never look at them . I guess it was a real old-fashioned holocam or something like that , because when I held the star up and the sun hit it again , I saw pictures . A young white guy with dark hair and real weird clothes all covered with mud . A real thin pale girl with chopped-off hair . A tired-looking black guy carting a gun so old it did n't have even basic sensorpac . They all sort of faded in and out , one after the other . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the place The pictures flashed by pretty fast , lots of them , and sort of shimmered , like the cam 'd been off-focus when it shot . - a woman wearing a ruby necklace and wet red skirt gone by the time I realized the red line across her throat was n't rubies , and her skirt did n't start out to be red The real funny thing was that all the people in the holo were holding the same damn star I 'd just picked out of the dirt . Like maybe it was a family heirloom or something . The holo-people all looked like ghosts , but you could see the star shining just as bright as a little free-atmosphere nuke . Weird . I turned the thing over in my hand and looked at it again . Pretty . There was n't much that was pretty anymore . And I 'd found it while on lone patrol , so it was all mine . That was the rule . I tucked the silver metal star into one of my belt carry-pocs . It felt good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . Later I 'd ask ; Rissa would know if stars were supposed to be lucky . But I was already sure the thing would bring me luck . They said luck warmed your bones , and that was how I could feel it , deep in mine . Like I owned all the time in the world . And my star would make a nice service souvenir after I 'd done my thirteenth patrol , or when the war ended . Whichever came first . Because the end for me might come even sooner than Lucky Thirteen . After all , they say we 'll be home by Christmas .
