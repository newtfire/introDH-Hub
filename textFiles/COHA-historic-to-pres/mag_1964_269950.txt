Latest news on the thin-wall apartment front is snoring . <P> Sam Sheir lives on the 16th floor of No. 35 Seacoast Terrace , a brand-new building in Brooklyn , and its walls are very thin . When he goes to bed , his head is only a matter of millimeters from the head of Sam and Ida Gutwirth 's double bed . And Sam Sheir snores . Not only does he snore-his snoring style was described at a hearing in Brooklyn Criminal Court last week as " of gigantic proportions , an animalistic roar , lionlike , that vibrates the rooms . " <P> Sam Sheir 's stentorian breathing was under discussion before a judge because snorer Sheir had haled Neighbor Gutwirth into court for repeatedly pounding on the wall to wake him , thereby making " unnecessary noise . " Sheir claimed that his snoring , by contrast , is necessary noise . Gutwirth admits it . " What the hell , " he says . " Snoring is like breathing , and how in the world are you going to ask somebody to stop giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snoring , but at least he can move his bed . " <P> Mr. Gutwirth rented a sound-level meter and measured the lionlike snores of Mr. Sheir as they came through the wall . A newspaper reporter who auditioned the Sheir snore , live , felt that all this electronic gear was unnecessary because " even to the naked ear it sounded like a circular saw going through a pine knot . " <P> Judge Matthew Pagan , who lives-quietly-in a substantially soundproof , 50-year-old brownstone and seems to feel that things have come to a pretty pass when a man ca n't snore the night away in his own bed without being afraid of waking the neighbors , suggested that both consult their landlord about what might be done to dampen the high fidelity of the Sheir snoring , and that everybody show up in court again next month .
