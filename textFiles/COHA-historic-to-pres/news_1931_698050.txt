To appreciate the recent fluctuation in the position of the pound sterling it must be remembered that England normally earns a big Income from its overseas trade , from its business as a world banker and from its tot eign Investments . This income may be estimated , roughly , at ? 4,000,000,000 . Ti ado dept ession and the fall in world prices has affected this surplus , especially as British costs have not fallen In proportion to the world price fall . Today England exports less goods , its ships earn less , its foreign investments pay smaller dividends , and even its banking business brings In less , owing to the recent fall in world money rates . Its 1929 its net income from abroad was ? 138,000.000 , but in 1930 it was only ? 39,000,000 . In 1931 it may show a loss . Great Britain Is the world 's banker . Like all bankers , it stands to be shot at by customers when they get poor or frightened . Conversely , like other bankers , it lends money to Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . Its net short-term indebtedness to the world was estimated by the Lord Committee on Finance and Industry as ? 254,000,000 at the end of 1930 , mostly duo to foreign banks and consisting either of sterling balances maintained by them in London or of foreign holdings of sterling acceptances . Vulnerability of Sterling This figure is ? 50,000,000 greater than the value of six months ' exports of British goods at the present level of trade , and about ? 100 , - 000,000 greater than British gold stocks . Thus , if all this suns is withdrawn at once , England could not meet it . This is the real vulnerability of sterling , but it must be appreciated that the strongest bank in the world would have to suspend payment if all its customers tried to withdraw their deposits at once . No bank keeps a 100 per cent casts ratio , nor does London keep a 100 per cent gold reserve against the foreign claims upon it . Thus , before the German crisis began , England 's net income from abroad was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trade depression and the fall in prices had undermined Its budget , as It had the budgets of other countries , including the United States . Its costs were higher than the current level of prices . For these rea- sons , confidence in it did not stand aulte so high as In previous years . Effects of German Crisis The German crisis had the following consequences : 1 . It froze up English loans to Germany , for London did not join In the world run on Germany . 2 . It shook confidence all over the world . 3 . It made banks all over the world decide to strengthen home cash resources In their oWn currency . 4 . It made banks all over the world draw on their sterling balances to strengthen their own home resources . 0 . It induced Paris banks to accelerate the withdrawals from London that they usually make each autumn to finance tax payments by their customers to the French treasury , . 6 . In short . it started a world tun on England as the world 's banker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports sufficiently to meet this run . Nor could it call in Its own money from Germany or elsewhere . Nor could it realize any of its ? 4,000,000,000 longterm investments quickly enough even though these term a big potential reserve , and in a teal emergency could be mobilized by the Government as were the British-owned dollar smithies in the war . England had to meet the " run " bl paying out gold , so far totaling more than ? 30,000,000,000. ' the Bank of England has also raised the discount rate from 21:1 to per cent . This brings the London rate high aboire Paris , Amsterdam , Zurich , New York or Brussels , and , oac : confidence returns , it should tempt money back to London again . Paris Misjudged London To meet the present impact of the run , credits were obtained ( tom Parts and New York . Paris thought that these credits were to be used at once and that sterling was henceforward to be pegged . London never intended to use these credits at once , however , but intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been reached . This confusion between the Paris and Luindon money centers explains Wednesday 's ' slump in sterling . Paris let sterling go , thinking Lon- don would take It up , and the baby fell between them . It is doubtful if the credits obtained have yet been touched . Expansion of the fiduciary note issues from ? 260,000,000 to E276,000,000 was a precaution . Note circulation always expands In the holiday season . Without a fiduciary limit relaxation , the growth in note circulation plus the gold losses might have reduced the bank 's reserve of notes , which forms the bulk of its legal reserve , lo a dangerously low level . Once the holiday notes return to the bank and gold losses are checked , the ? 260,000,000 limit can be restored . In short , England has been weakened slightly by the trade depression and the German crisis has started a world run on London England has immense reserves but does not wish to use them unnecessarily to meet what is hoped to be a passing emergency . Nor can she mobilize them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterling will recover , too .
