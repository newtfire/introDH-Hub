Wintry rainstorms pelted the Uruguayan seaside resort of Punta del Este last week , forming an ominously fitting backdrop for the historic meeting of government ministers . Officials from 74 countries had arrived there to confront the ill wind of protectionism , which is threatening to freeze international trade and economic growth . The ministers , who at times donned Uruguayan wool sweaters and huddled around space heaters , struggled to agree on an agenda for a multiyear series of talks that they hope will create warmer trade relationships around the world . Declared Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti as he opened the five-day meeting : " We have to decide whether we are going to promote active and vigorous trade with equal opportunities for all , or whether we will choose the path of trade wars . " <P> After a week of tiring and often tense negotiations that ran well past midnight last Friday , the ministers resolved their differences and successfully launched the " Uruguay Round " of trade talks . Up until the last minute , delegates were haggling over such sticky agenda topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter , who staggered back to his hotel room at 5:30 a.m . Saturday and got only two hours of sleep before boarding a plane home , was ecstatic at * the outcome . Said he : " The launching of the Uruguay Round is a major victory for the principles of free and fair trade . " <P> The umbrella for the new talks will be the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , a treaty created in 1947 and administered by a staff based in Geneva . The GATT group , which includes 92 countries , has staged seven epic rounds of trade talks , the most recent one dragging on from 1973 to 1979 . The negotiations brought substantial reductions in tariffs , but GATT members thought it was time for another round . Reason : too many countries have circumvented the group 's rules by raising a thicket of nontariff barriers , including import quotas , product standards and other obstacles to free trade . Said Leopoldo Tettamanti , the Argentine delegate to GATT : " We are in a mess . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual exports of goods and services . World merchandise trade is expected to expand only about 3% this year , a sickly performance compared with the nearly 6% average annual growth of the 1970s . Protectionism is a prime reason for the slow pace . <P> The Reagan Administration , which generally neglected trade issues during its early years , was a prime mover in mounting the new talks . Congress and corporate leaders have put pressure on the Administration to stem the flood of imports into the U.S. , which may produce a record trade deficit of $175 billion this year . Most members of Congress want to narrow that gap by imposing protectionist measures , which the President opposes . <P> The Administration sees the GATT round as a way to pre-empt Congress , since productive trade talks could open up foreign markets to increased U.S. exports . To cover every possible angle at the GATT session , the White House sent , along with Yeutter , a heavy-hitting team : Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige , Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and nearly 60 other delegates .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
