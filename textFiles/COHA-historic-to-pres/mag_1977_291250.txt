In ancient China , wood was classified as an element , one of the irreducible components of the universe , along with air , fire , water and earth . It was also an element of society . There , and even more so in Japan , civilized life was inconceivable without wood , which furnished a world of artifacts , from the largest temple to the smallest lacquered box . <P> The nature of wood-its grain , luster , density , color and growth-is one of the material obsessions of Oriental art . Of all substances from which sculpture could be made , wood was the closest to life . But other materials were more durable . Most surviving Chinese sculpture , from the Chou dynasty ( 1122-222 B.C. ) onwards , is in substances that do not burn , rot or get worm-eaten : stone , ceramic , bronze . Nevertheless , the tradition of wooden sculpture was immense . It can not be exhausted in one show ; but this week a delectable exhibition of 70 objects , all from Western collections , opens at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood : China and Japan , " it was organized for the Portland Museum of Art-where it opened last November-by Art Historian Donald Jenkins . <P> A Log Is a Log Is a Log . " Masterworks in Wood " covers a lot of ground , once over and rather lightly . One of the oldest objects in it , a lean and time-scarred funerary horse , was made in China late in the Eastern Chou dynasty , some 2,200 years ago ; the more recent works include a scholar 's writing box and an incised sign from a sake shop in 19th century Japan . The works are predominantly Buddhist , although there are two or three exceptional Shinto cult objects . The stylistic range is also very broad . Some of the pieces are , in essence , conventional religious decoration - like the spectacular head of a horned dragon ( see color page ) , its jaws rippling like the blade of a Malay kris , which was carried on a lance to repel evil spirits during religious processions in Nara , near Kyoto . Other sculptures are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in 3rd century tombs in what had been the Chinese kingdom of Ch'u . Still other pieces , such as the 13th century Chinese figure of the Bodhisattva of Compassion , Kuan-Yin , have extraordinary , almost liquid grace and animation that seem to contradict the graininess and density of the wood itself . <P> A wood carver is more limited by the size of his raw material than any other sculptor . A log is a log ; it can not be melted down or extended . One can order marble to size , but no tree in China or Japan could possibly give a sculptor a large enough balk of timber to carve something as big as Michelangelo 's David . Even if there was such a tree , there would be insuperable problems of technique . Wood is grainy . It favors continuous , compressed shapes with a strong axis along the grain . Anything that sticks sideways from the block-an arm , say-is weak and splits off . Hence the elongated , torpedo-like form of a Shinto deity from Japan 's Kamakura period ( 12th-14th centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and baggy pants , but carved with a reductive formal elegance that might have inspired Brancusi seven centuries later . All its shapes are circumscribed by the block ; one could roll it downhill .
