Since his discharge from the Navy , young F.D.R. has made unmistakable motions toward becoming a politician himself . <P> While still on terminal leave , he threw himself into veterans ' problems with familiar Rooseveltian vigor , began a whirlwind campaign to get 20,000 temporary homes for veterans in his native New York . <P> Mayor LaGuardia put him off , scorning his telephone calls ( two a day for eight days ) , refusing to see him . So F.D.R. Jr . took to the soapbox : " The Mayor claims these houses ca n't be put up because they will become slums . We do n't want slums . We want these temporary houses torn down in two or three years . But we are not so afraid of the future that we are willing to let veterans sleep in the parks . . . .
