President Nasser 's government is speedily ending its five-year-old military intervention in Yemen in order to strengthen its " defend-Egypt-first " policy . Neutral diplomats returning here from Yemen confirm that Egyptian troops are moving steadily out of Yemen by sea and air . Cairo 's most authoritative newspaper , Al Ahram , reported Oct. 6 that all Egyptian troops , estimated last June before the Arab-Israel war at 40,000 , would be out of Yemen by Dec. 15 and removed from Sanaa , the republican Yemeni capital , by Oct. 15 . Some of these forces presumably are to be made available for frontline duty in the Suez Canal zone facing Israeli occupation troops in the Sinai Peninsula . Goal called complete Egyptian civilian experts assigned to help President Sallal 's Yemen republican regime also will be withdrawn " so there can be no shadow of a doubt " about Egyptian intentions to withdraw , Al Ahram said . It added that the experts would be on call if Yemen decided it needed them later . Government-inspired newspaper and broadcast comment here is that United Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal , has achieved its main goals . British forces have begun withdrawal from neighboring South Arabia . Rival South Ara- bian nationalist factions are soon to meet here to plan an independent government . President Sallal reftised to see or cooperate with a three-man Arab conciliation commission appointed at the Khartoum Arab summit conference last month to help reconcile the opposing Yemeni factions . Its members , Sudanese Prime Minister Mohammed Mahgoub , Iraqi Foreign Minister Ismail Khairallah , and the Moroccan Ambassador to Lebanon , Ahmed Bensouda , returned here after Marshal Sallal 's rebuff to plan their next moves . Concern over disorders Cairo 's attitude was summed up by one Egyptian diplomat as one of concern about recent disorders and tribal fighting . These have led to a capital sentence on Colonel Abdel Qader al Khatari , Deputy Yemeni Interior Minister , by a military court . " But it is up to the Yemenis to sort out // *Cairo speeds withdrawal of troops based in Yemen // their own differences now , " the diplomat said . There is a vast sense of relief here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion dollars since it began with the Yemeni revolution of September , 1962 , has ended . Cairo now is feeling a new impact of the much-closer Arab-Israel war in June : artillery duels in the Suez Canal zone last Sept. 25 in which nearly 100 civilians were reported killed in Ismailia and Suez . An estimated 60,000 refugees have poured into Cairo on trains and buses . They are mainly women , children , and older people . Evacuation seen Ali Sabry , President Nasser 's newly appointed minister resident in the canal zone , said that most " nonessential workers " ? those not employed in schools or public services  --  would next be evacuated . At a news conference in Suez Mr. Sabry termed this a " forced migration . " The government has promised to pay resettlement costs for the refugees , which may number up to a quarter of a million . Arrangements already are being made to readmit school children to new schools once they are established in new homes in the Beni Suef Province of Upper Egypt and other underpopulated areas . Defense remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time since the June war sees far more sandbags and brick antiblast walls on Cairo sidewalks than before the war . Every building owner has been ordered to provide them . Public air-raid shelters are being dug in Cairo , Alexandria , Port Said and the other main towns . Khaki-clad militiamen of the Arab Socialist Union , Egypt 's ruling political party , are seen drilling all over Cairo suburbs , especially near military bases where Israeli bombs fell June 5 . People in casual conversation invariably ask a foreigner : " Do you think we will have peace , or war again ? Are the Israelis going to get out of our country ? " Realization of the extent of last June 's defeat has largely penetrated public thinking . It has not seemed to change much the basically unwarlike inclinations of the ordinary Egyptian . Al Ahram editor Mohammed Heykal Oct. 6 published the frankest public analysis yet seen of prewar Egytian " mistakes . " He said they had been military , economic , social , and political . He strongly criticized Arab " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Israeli adversary .
