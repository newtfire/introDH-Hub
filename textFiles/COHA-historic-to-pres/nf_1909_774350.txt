| The rates given in the table are for a daily round trip . If a car makes the trip but one way each day , the payment is one half the sum named in the table . In 1908 , there were 1,342 full-sized post office cars in use and in reserve . It will be noted that the rate of compensation per pound or per ton received by the railroads for carrying the mails grows less with the increase in the weight of daily mails . The pay per ton per mile for a daily mail averaging 2,000 pounds , or one ton , is only one half the rate for a daily weight of 500 pounds . As the mail carried grows in weight the pay received by the railroad increases , but not in proportion to the volume of traffic . It would be too much trouble and would cause delay to weigh the mails every time they are sent . For that reason the Government determines the weight of mail over any route once in four years by having the mails weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this period is assumed to be the daily average for the four succeeding years , but the weight normally increases year by year ; and it is probable that the railroads are required to carry about ten per cent of the mails free during the last year or two of the four-year period . The Postal Deficit. ? The post office department makes a profit upon first- , third- , and fourth-class mail , but it incurs a very large deficit in handling the second-class mail , most of which pays the very low rate of one cent per pound . About sixty-four per cent of the total weight of mail has the benefit of the cent-a-pound rates , and the receipts therefrom are but 5.19 per cent of the total post office revenue . This is the main cause of the large annual postal deficit . Another cause for this deficit is the expense of the rural free delivery services which is only partly met by the postage on the mail matter handled over those routes . The // postal deficit could easily be changed into a surplus by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of a rural parcels post . The Parcels Post. ? It is difficult to understand why the United States Government should be the last one of the great nations of the world to introduce a parcels post . If the Government were to accept packages weighing up to ten pounds in weight for delivery in cities , and up to twenty-five pounds in weight for delivery by rural carriers , there would unquestionably be a large increase in the postal revenues ; and , what is more important , the public would obtain a much needed service . The private express companies naturally are opposed to a parcels post , and they are supported in their opposition by retail merchants in the smaller cities who are afraid that the large mail-order houses in Chicago and other big cities will secure an undue share of the rural trade . The arguments of the express companies hardly ought to prevail , and if it should be deemed wise to protect the local merchants , the Government can do so by restricting the rural parcels post to the transportation of packages between points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery parcels post thus restricted , the question of establishing an unlimited parcels post can be decided more intelligently . Ultimately , we shall doubtless follow the practice now prevailing in other countries , and open our mails liberally to the parcels traffic .  | Public Nature and Unity of Railway Services. ? Railroad corporations are created by the State to perform a service which would otherwise be done by the Government . Although the railroad company is legally a private corporation , its services are of a public nature , and the nature of the service is in no wise changed by the fact that the Government chooses to have the work done by a corporation . Another important characteristic of the transportation service is that although it consists of many parts performed by numerous and separate corporations , it requires unity of action on the part of these agencies . Carriers must work together , if the public is to be well served ; and it is the duty of the Government to promote and enforce such measures of cooperation as will secure unity and harmony of action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations Cooperative and Competitive. ? While railways must cooperate with each other in performing their services , they are also competitors . Every railroad company desires to secure an increasing volume of traffic because it can add to its traffic without proportionately enlarging its expenses . Its net profits rise with the growth in the volume of business . This is a permanent cause of inter-railway competition . There is , however , another cause which // is even more powerful . Every large railroad company performs the transportation work required to connect the industries in the section of country which it serves with the markets where the products of those industries are sold . It is well known that every large market of the world can be and is supplied from many regions of production . This results in an inter-regional competition among producers to place their goods upon the important markets ; and thus the railroads that carry the products to the markets are bound up with this competition ; because no railroad company can afford to permit the industries which it serves to decline or to develop more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When two rival railways compete for the same traffic , their struggle is often so intense as to be called a rate war . A railroad will prefer to take traffic at rates which but little more than cover the extra expenses incurred by handling the particular traffic in question ; because anything above this extra expense is profit to the company and contributes something , although but little , towards defraying the general expenses for maintenance , repairs , equipment , structures , and office administration . Stated otherwise , the expenditures of any railroad company are partly of a general character quite independent of particular traffic services , and are in part directly the result of handling traffic . About all a railroad company can save by refusing to take particular shipments are the train costs resulting from handling that particular traffic ; and as long as receipts from any class of business cover the train costs and yield a small surplus to be applied to the company 's general expenses , every railroad will naturally seek to hold business against competitors . Agreements to Restrain Competition. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous rate wars has clearly proven that it is necessary for them to unite on some method of restraining competition . There are four possible methods by which railroad companies may check their rivalries : ( 1 ) They may make hard and fast agreements with each other to maintain certain rates , each company being left free to secure as much business as possible at those rates ; ( 2 ) They may contract with each other to divide up their competitive traffic according to agreed per centages , each company taking such a share of the total competitive business as it has previously demonstrated itself to be entitled to ; ( 3 ) The companies may agree to divide up their total earnings from competitive traffic according to agreed ratios ; ( 4 ) The rival roads may divide up the field , each company thereby receiving a section of the country within which it is to be allowed to conduct and develop its business unmolested by the other railroads party to the agreement . Rate Agreements. ? The first of these four plans for restraining competition ? rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1858 , when the leading railroads in the East had become of great enough mileage to be able to engage in competition with each other they began the practice " of agreeing upon remunerative rates . " Such agreements worked with fair satisfaction until about 1870 , when some companies secured control of through lines from the Atlantic seaboard to Chicago , and began to struggle violently for the control of the traffic to and from the great Mississippi Valley . Then a higher form of inter-railway organization became necessary . Traffic Associations. ? During the decade following 1870 , traffic associations were formed to regulate in detail the relations of railway companies with each other . From 1874 // to 1876 , the powerful Southern Railway &; Steamship Assuciation was built up by the genius of filbert Fink . This was immediately followed by the organization of the Trunk Line Association , the Central Traffic Association , the Western , the Southwestern , the Transcontinental and various others . Usually separate associations were formed for the regulation of freight and passenger traffic . Most of the // original traffic associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still exist and are an important factor in railway management . The two most salient features of these traffic associations were rate agreements and pooling contracts . Railway Pools. ? The second and third of the four methods of regulating competition ? the division of competitive traffic or the division of earnings from that traffic ? are popularly called railway pooling . Between 1870 and 1887 , railway pooling became general in all parts of the United States . Pools were agreements among railroads whereby their competitive traffic , or the receipts from that traffic , were divided among the companies according to stipulated ratios . The arrangements for the division of the business were called traffic pools ; those for the distribution of the receipts , money pools . The public was strongly opposed to railway pooling , because it was thought that the railroads entered into these pooling contracts for the purpose of charging and maintaining extortionate rates . Thus , when the Interstate Commerce Act for the regulation of railroads was passed in 1887 , common carriers were prohibited from pooling their competitive profits or earnings thereof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reorganize their traffic associations and to omit all pooling arrangements ; they were then obliged to regulate their rivalries as best they could by their rate agreements which were made as rigidly binding as possible . Rate agreements proved ineffective for the regulation of the intense competition that developed during 1893 , and the succeeding years of serious business depression . The railway situation was extremely unsatisfactory at this time ; and , in 1897 , the outlook for the future was made // increasingly doubtful by a decision of the United States Supreme Court whereby rate agreements among railroads were held to be in violation of the antitrust law that had been passed in 1890 . It now became unlawful for the railroads to decide upon and enforce common rates upon competitive traffic ; at the same time , it was clearly impossible for the railroads to carry on their business without having an understanding with each other as to rates on traffic free to move by more than one railway line . For each company to work independently of all others , would be to inaugurate constant warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other as to rates , and sought to bring about unity of action by informal understanding rather than by formal agreement . Fortunately , this was made possible by the return of prosperous times in 1898 , which brought about a rapid increase in the traffic earnings of all railroad companies . Railway Consolidations. ? After 1898 , railway consolidation became rapid . This was mainly due to the necessity the railroads felt of controlling their traffic rivalries and of avoiding the waste of competition . There were , however , other contributory causes , the chief of which was the desire of ambitious financiers and large banking firms to build up and control extensive railway systems . Consolidations were brought about ( 1 ) by the purchase of one or more railroad companies by those owning another ; ( 2 ) by long term leases , and ( 3 ) by the working out of " community of interest " in the management of distinct companies . The extent to which railway consolidation had been accomplished by 1909 has been explained in Chapter III . The first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third calls for a brief description . // Community of Interest. ? After numerous large railway systems had been built up by consolidation , it became the practice for the directors of each of those systems to elect to their board , directors or officers from one or more of the other large companies . Thus community of interest was established . Usually community of interest is accompanied by community of ownership , the principal owners of one company being financially interested in other rival roads . In other words , there is ordinarily a community of interest both in ownership and management . This plan of securing harmonious action among rival interests was well illustrated in the construction of the Board of Directors of the Northern Pacific in 1901 . The Great Northern and Union Pacific were each trying to secure control of the Northern Pacific . The struggle also involved the control of the Burlington System , and thus concerned the interests of the Chicago &; Northwestern System , a competitor of the Burlington having close traffic relations with the Vanderbilt or New York Central System . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burlington , and a road closely connected with the Pennsylvania System , was also interested in the outcome of the contest . The rival parties placed their interests in the hands of J. P. Morgan , who settled the struggle by placing on the directorate of the Northern Pacific the president of the Great Northern , the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Union Pacific , a director of the Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul , a director of the Chicago &; Northwestern , and a vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad .  | Consolidation and Monopoly Charges. ? The chief purposes railroad companies have in forming associations and . in consolidating are to regulate their services , and to agree as to the rates to be charged upon competitive traffic . As has been explained in the previous chapter , the railroads have not been allowed to cooperate legally in rate making , and for this and other reasons they have proceeded rapidly with consolidation . They have united chiefly to restrain competition and to lessen expenses . To what extent , it may be asked , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a monopoly . Are railroad rates competitive or monopolistic , or do they partake in part of both characteristics ? In order to answer this question it is necessary to agree upon what is meant by monopoly . A manufacturer or a railroad company having the power to fix the prices which the buyer must pay has a monopoly ; monopoly is the power to fix prices . Any individual or combination having the full power to decide what the producer must pay possesses a complete monopoly . This condition , however , does not exist in many kinds of business . Usually the buyer of commodities or of transportation services has more or less power to determine what prices he shall pay . In such cases , the producer has a partial monopoly and not a complete one ; but whether the monopoly which the producer // has is partial or complete , the essence of his monopoly is his power over prices . Any business enterprise , whether it be large or small , is monopolistic to the extent that those who manage it can determine what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a Complete Monopoly . ? While it is clear that our great railway systems , some of which own and control practically all of the lines in wide sections of the country , must have large power to determine what transportation charges the public shall pay , it is none the less true that there are competitive forces which railroads can not control and which prevent them from establishing a complete monopoly in the making of rates and fares : ( 1 ) Every railroad company , as was stated above , is eager to increase the volume of its business , because the net profits upon each ton of freight or upon each passenger are larger the greater the traffic . This being true , every railroad company is careful to keep its rates low enough to permit a steady increase in business . ( 2 ) An even greater influence upon railway charges is exerted by the " competition of markets , " by which is meant the efforts of producers in different sections of the country to supply common markets . Every railroad company is a joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumbermen , helping them to get their products into the world 's market at a total cost for production and transportation that will permit the commodities to be sold in large and increasing quantities . It is especially to be noted that this " competition of the markets " is not affected by the consolidation of railroads . The real competition is between the regions of production ; and the railroads , whether operated separately or in combination with each other , are involved in the struggle of producers for the // control of , or a share in , the markets . For the trade of the Southern States , for instance , there is active competition between the manufacturers of the New England States and those in the upper Mississippi Valley . Producers shipping from Pennsylvania , New York , or New England to the South secure desirable rail rates , because it is also possible to ship coastwise by water . The manufacturers in Chicago and other cities in the upper Mississippi Valley are able to secure as low rail rates to the South as eastern shippers obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates , the manufacturers in the Middle West would be debarred from southern markets , and the traffic would be lost to the railroads. ( 3 ) The local shipper served by only one railroad is not completely at the mercy of the carrier , since his rates are not permitted by law to be higher than those granted to producers shipping past him to common markets . Furthermore , the traffic officials know that if they make their local rates too high new industries will not be established along their line , but along the roads of rival carriers that offer favorable rates and services . This brief analysis of the competitive forces in railroad charges shows that the railroad company , however large and powerful it may be , possesses only a partial monopoly in making rates . It is seldom possible for the railroad to compel its patrons to pay all they would pay rather than go without the transportation services desired ; in other words the railroad company possesses a partial and not a complete monopoly . Upon What Rates May Be Based. ? In most lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cost of performing the service , and it might be supposed that railways would fix their rates and fares in accordance // with the expenses incurred in transporting freight and passengers . If this were the general practice , charges for services of various kinds would vary according to the differences in the cost of performing the several tasks . As a matter of fact , however , railroad charges are based quite as much upon the value of the service to the shipper and upon the value of the article transported as upon the carrier 's costs . Terminal and Line Costs. ? Various standards are adopted in fixing charges ; and rates and fares must also cover two distinct expenditures , i. e. , terminal and line costs . Every railroad company must provide itself with stations and yards , and in large cities these . are very expensive . It must , also , load and unload most freight traffic . Experience shows that it costs on an average from 40 to 50 cents per ton to perform necessary terminal services . The maintenance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the line costs . It will be seen that terminal expenses do not depend upon length of haul or the distance traveled by passengers ; while , on the contrary , line expenses vary with , although not strictly in proportion to , the distance . The Cost of Service Basis of Rate. ? While rates and fares are influenced by the cost of the services , it is impossible to make cost the sole or main basis of charges , because the cost of particular transportation services can not be ascertained . Every railroad carries thousands of different commodities ; a single freight train will usually have a large variety of articles in its cars and often many kinds of goods are shipped iii the same car . To run its trains and to handle its cars , there must be a roadway , depots and yards , and thousands of dollars of general expenses must be incurred to maintain and operate the railroad as a // whole . The gross receipts from passengers and shippers must cover all expenses , but no one is able to say just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transporting a hundredweight or carload of goods , or from carrying a passenger a given number of miles . Most of the expenditures of a railroad company are joint costs , only a part of its outlay can be charged against individual services . In other words , the cost can not be made the exact basis of railroad charges , because the cost can not be determined . The Value of Service Basis. ? If a bushel of wheat is worth 90 cents in Chicago and $1.00 in New York , the transportation of wheat from Chicago to New York adds 10 cents to its value , i. e. , the value of the service to the Chicago shipper is about 10 cents ; and the railroad company can , if it chooses , make that increase in value the basis of its rates . Similarly , if travelers on an average value a railroad trip from Philadelphia to Chicago at $15.00 , the railroads can make that value the basis of their fare . In all rate making , traffic officials study carefully the value of the service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic will bear . " Value of Commodities Basis , or Taxation Principle. ? It will be found in studying railroad rates that the value of the commodity also has much influence upon the charge made by the carrier . Articles of high value , like silks , can pay a high rate , while charges on cement , coal and iron must be low ; often the low rate on such a commodity as coal may be thirty per cent or forty per cent of its value , at point of production , while the high rate on silk may be less than one per cent of its value at the mill . If rates were fixed mainly in accordance with the value of the articles , railway charges would be similar to taxation , and the car114 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION riers would secure their necessary revenues by taxing producers and shippers certain percentages of the value of their goods . The tax principle , however , can not be carried so far as this in the making of rates . Competition and Rate Making. ? It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fares as will hold traffic against competitors ; and , in the case of an extensive railway system , competition exists in many forms and at many places . The traffic will not bear a higher rate than is offered by a competing railway line or water route ; and , while the traffic official will be influenced in fixing his rates : ( 1 ) by measurable differences in cost of service ; ( 2 ) by the value of the service to the shipper , and ( 3 ) by the value of commodities transported , he will , to a considerable extent , be obliged to disregard all of these standards and make his rates conform to competitive conditions . Whatever he does , he must , if possible , secure an increasing volume of traffic for his company . Rates Must be Reasonable and Just. ? In making rates to meet competitive conditions , some localities are certain to receive more favorable treatment than others do . The discriminations , however , between persons , places , and different commodities must be reasonable ; the rates must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place as to prevent its healthy development . The chief purpose of Government regulation of rates is to prevent the competitive struggles of railroad companies from resulting in unreasonable discriminations in rates . It is the business of the State to see that localities and shippers are treated with absolute and relative justice . What is a Reasonable Rate ? ? There is no mathematical formula by which a reasonable rate may be determined . It is certain , however , that rates can not be lower than the // extra cost resulting from the performance of the particular services for which the charges are made . If the State were to fix rates below that point , it would soon destroy the value of the railroad property . It is equally true that railway charges can not be greater than the value of the service to the shipper or traveler . If the railroads were to attempt to make the rates higher than the value of the service , the traffic would rapidly decline . Thus the additional cost of performing a particular service fixes the minimum below which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the service fixes the maximum beyond which they can not rise . The reasonable rate is somewhere between these two extremes , and must be determined for each class of traffic or each important commodity with reference to measurable costs of service , and with regard to the value of the article . The actual fixing of rates by traffic officials and their regulation by the Government involve an exercise of human judgment rather than the solution of a mathematical problem .  | Rates More Important than Fares. ? The conditions controlling the making of freight rates are so different from those that prevail in determining passenger fares that it will be well to consider the two separately . It is much easier to decide upon and enforce passenger fares than it is to fix freight rates , and the policy of the railway company in regard to freight charges is of much greater importance . It will , accordingly , be best to devote the larger part of this account of how rates and fares are made to freight charges . Classification of Freight the First Step in Rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transport many thousand kinds of articles , it is necessary for the railroads to group the commodities into a limited number of classes , and to base the rates as far as possible upon classes instead of upon individual articles . The manner in which the classification of freight was worked out was briefly described in Chapter VII . Efforts have been made from time to time , but thus far unsuccessfully , to prepare a satisfactory classification to apply to the entire country . It has , however , been found practicable to reduce the number of freight classifications in the United States to three ? the Official , which is in force north of the Ohio and Potomac and east of the Mississippi ; the Southern , south of the Ohio and Potomac and east of the Mississippi ; // and the Western , west of the Mississippi . In each of these territories there is a classification committee of which the several railroad companies are members , and the classification of freight in each section is decided upon , or is amended , by action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As has been explained above , the classification does not include articles like grain , livestock , coal , and other articles that are shipped in bulk and usually in train-load lots . This bulk freight goes at commodity rates , and the commodities outside of the classification , because of their great volume and weight , make up more than half of the total tonnage . Officials Intrusted with Rate Making. ? The task of making rates belongs to the traffic department of the railroad . At the head of this department , there is a vice-president of the company ; and under him , if the company is large , there will be a freight traffic manager and a passenger traffic manager . Subordinate to the freight traffic manager is the general freight agent . Large railway systems find it necessary to subdivide the work of the general freight agent 's office and to have a general freight agent in charge of local traffic and another to supervise through traffic ; and sometimes there is a third agent in control of coal freight . The rate sheets are prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official to whom the company looks for the actual making of the rates . The rate sheets he issues are signed by him and by his immediate superior , the freight traffic manager . The general freight agent is controlled as to his general policy of rate making by the freight traffic manager , who in turn consults with the vicepresident at the head of the traffic department concerning important questions of policy . Some of the largest , but // only the most important , questions of traffic policy will be brought to the attention of the president and the board of directors . The making of railroad freight rates for a large railroad system is a difficult task , involving a knowledge of a multitude of details ; and it is necessary for the general freight agent to obtain his information from those under him , the division freight agents and their subordinates , the freight solicitors , who come into closer touch with business in different sections of the country served by the railroad , and who have personal acquaintance with the larger patrons of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the rates are made according to the method just described is local to the lines of the company making the rates , the general freight agent publishes and issues his rate sheets without consulting with competing carriers . All rates on interstate traffic must be filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington and do not become effective until thirty days after they have been thus filed . Many companies have such a large coal traffic that the making of coal rates is in the hands of the general coal freight agent whose method of procedure in the determination of actual charges is similar to that for other kinds of traffic . Competitive and Through Rates ? Functions of Freight Traffic Associations. ? In the making of competitive and through rates , the general freight agent , or the traffic manager , will not reach a final decision until he has consulted the traffic officials of other railroads that may be affected by the proposed rate . The conferences in regard to these rates take place at meetings of the freight traffic associations . Every railroad company is a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive and through rates were decided by formal action of the traffic association , which imposed penalties upon its members for violation of the rate agreement ; but , in 1897 , the Supreme Court held such agreements to be a violation of the antitrust law . Since that time , it has been necessary for each railroad company to act independently in the making of its rates ; as a matter of fact , however , competing and connecting lines have to be consulted with , and rates are informally decided upon at the meetings of the traffic associations . The rates thus found to be acceptable to all interested carriers are put into effect by separate action of the individual companies . No attempt is made to enforce these informal rate agreements by fines and penalties . Rates in Trunk Line &; Central Traffic Association Territory ? The Percentage Tariff System. ? In the Trunk Line &; Central Traffic Association territory east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio and Potomac , the through rates on classified traffic over the numerous competing lines to and from the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a basis the rate from Chicago to New York by the shortest line . East-bound class rates to New York from other points than Chicago are fixed percentages of the rate from Chicago to New York . On west-bound class rates , likewise , the New York-Chicago rate is the base , and the rates from New York to other cities than Chicago are percentages of the base rate . The principle may be illustrated by referring to the west-bound class rates . The rates from New York to Buffalo , Pittsburg and Erie , that is , to the Lakes and the Ohio River , are tariffs established by each of the trunk lines , acting nominally independent , and the charges are , in general , in accordance with distance . To points west of // Buffalo , Erie and Pittsburg another system of rate making , the percentage plan , applies . The rate from New York to Indianapolis , for instance , is ninety-three per cent of the rate from New York to Chicago ; to places west of Chicago , the charge is greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a rate from the Atlantic seaboard of one hundred and ten per cent of the rate to Chicago . The same general principle applies east-bound on class traffic . In Central Traffic Association territory , the eastbound rates to points as far east as Buffalo , Erie and Pittsburg are the distance tariffs of the Central Freight Association ; while from all points other than Chicago in Central Traffic Association territory to New York and other places east of Buffalo , Erie , Pittsburg and Wheeling , the charges are certain percentages of the Chicago-New York rate . From Detroit to New York the rate is seventy-two per cent of the Chicago-New York rate . From Chicago to Albany the rate is ninety-six per cent of the Chicago-New York charge ; from Indianapolis to Albany , ninety-three per cent of the Chicago-Albany rate . The map of the Central Traffic Association territory and of a portion of Lower Canada marks the boundaries of the districts having like percentages of the Chicago-New York ( east-bound ) rates . The percentage rate system is in reality a zone tariff system ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips or zones of territory . The map is adapted from one in Ripley 's Railway Problems , where a full account of the Trunk Line and Central Traffic rate system is given . Rates in Southern Territory ? The Basing Point System. ? South of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi , the main feature of rate making is the basing point system . The // rates to each of the larger cities where competition prevails is made the basis of the charges to local points adjacent to such centers . The principal cities of the South , which are the main centers for the collection and distribution of traffic , are called basing points . Rates at basing points are Figure fixed subject to competition of alternate routes to and from those cities . The rate from a distance to local towns in the region about a basing point city is the sum of the rate to the basing point , plus the local tariff from the basing point to the local town . For instance , the rate // from Philadelphia to a town within twenty-five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Philadelphia to Atlanta , plus the rate from Atlanta to the adjacent town . If this local point is on the way from Philadelphia to Atlanta , it pays a higher rate than Atlanta for a shorter haul . This discrimination against the smaller town has been held to be legal because of the greater competition at Atlanta , the basing point . This system of rate making does not apply to quite all the southern territory , but its application is so general as to make it the main feature of the southern rate policy . Transcontinental Rates ? The Blanket System. ? For the traffic moved east and west between the section of the United States adjacent to or near to the Atlantic and the region bordering on the Pacific , there is active competition of two kinds . The numerous transcontinental rail lines compete with each other and they , as a whole , endeavor to hold the traffic against the competition of the steamship lines handling traffic between our two seaboards . This has had two results : One result is a lower rate from points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is given to places en route situated in the States immediately east of those bordering on the Pacific . The lower rate on the longer haul to the coast than on the shorter haul to places in Utah , and Nevada , etc. , is given to meet the competition of the steamship lines . The other result has been to cause the rate to the Pacific seaboard terminals , from San Diego to Seattle , to be the same from all points east of the Missouri River . The charge from New York to San Francisco is no higher than from St. Louis or Kansas City to San Francisco on practically all kinds of freight . This is called the blanket system of rate making , by // which is meant that the whole territory east of the Missouri River is blanketed by the same west-bound rate . The rate from any point east of the Missouri River to an intermediate point , as Reno , Nev. , just east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains , is determined as follows : to the blanket rate from the eastern point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case would be Sacramento , is added the local rate from Sacramento to Reno , The traffic is hauled only as far as Reno , but the rate is the sum of the rate to Sacramento , plus the rate from Sacramento to Reno . Transcontinental rates east bound are not blanketed over so wide a territory in the east as are those on traffic moved in the opposite direction . Local or distance tariff rates prevail from the Pacific terminals to the Missouri River points ; then all places in the territory between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers pay a fixed sum or differential above the rate to the Missouri River . All places between the Mississippi River and Chicago have the same differential above the rate to the Mississippi . This rate is again increased by a fixed sum for shipments to all points between Chicago and Pittsburg , and the rates to points between Pittsburg and the Atlantic seaboard are a fixed amount above the rate to Pittsburg . In other words , the rate from the Pacific seaboard to points east of the Missouri River are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passenger Fares. ? Each large railroad company has a passenger traffic manager under whose immediate supervision is the general passenger agent , who is the man that decides upon and issues the schedules of fares . If the fares apply only upon the lines of his own company , they are probably made without consulting competing and connecting carriers ; if , however , the fares apply to coin124 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION petitive traffic in which rival lines are interested any proposal regarding such fares is brought to the attention of the passenger traffic association , where it is considered by all lines interested in the proposition . When the members of the traffic association have agreed informally , the general passenger agent , acting solely for his own company , files the rate sheets with the Interstate Commerce Commission , and at the expiration of thirty days required by law , the fares that have been informally agreed upon by all parties in interest become effective through the nominally independent action of the carrier filing the rate sheet . Special Fares for Special Traffic. ? It is well known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many kinds . The most important of these are the commutation rates given to residents in the suburbs of large cities . In this manner , the local traffic of railroads has been greatly stimulated . Excursions of many kinds with largely reduced fares are run at all seasons of the year . Practically every large convention secures special rates , and the railroad solicitors are always eager to secure the convention traffic . Among the other many forms of exceptional traffic , and one that is growing rapidly , is that to winter and summer resorts . The increasing number of people spending the winter in Florida and other southern sections , and the travel to the sea coast and mountains , to New England , to Canada , and to other sections having a cool summer climate , grows year by year with the increase in population and the improvement in transportation facilities .  | The Government Must Both Aid and Regulate Railways. ?

It is necessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is true whether the railroads be built and operated by the Government or by corporations . Regulation , as will be shown later , may take the form of Government ownership and operation , or it may consist of controlling the services and charges of the corporations which the Government intrusts with the performance of the railway transportation business . If the roads are constructed and managed by railroad companies , they must first be aided by the State with a charter giving them a large grant of powers . To secure a right of way , it is necessary for the corporation to exercise temporarily the State 's " right of eminent domain . " Moreover , in addition to these necessary forms of aid , it has been the practice of both the central and local governments in most countries to give financial assistance to companies constructing railways . This chapter has to do with public aid in the United States . Aid Given by the Several State Governments. ? Although the railways in the United States were built mainly with private capital , the companies received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also from // counties and cities . The first aid was given by the States . Their assistance began to be active as early as 1837 , when the United States Government deposited its surplus revenue with the States . At that time , the aid given to transportation by the States went mainly toward constructing canals and highways , but after 1850 , the assistance of the Government was given principally to the railroads . The financial help which the States gave to canals and railways was more liberal than was warranted by their revenues . The ideas of the public at that time in regard to banking and financial methods were crude ; and , as a consequence , many States contracted such heavy debts that they were seriously embarrassed for a long time . Some States even went so far as to repudiate their debts . The assistance given by the States to railroad construction consisted most often of the purchase of the stocks of the corporations . Sometimes the States bought and paid for them either in cash or in State bonds . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sums thus advanced were never repaid , and the loans became gifts . The amount of aid given by the States is not definitely known . There were , in all , nineteen States which gave or advanced public funds for railroad construction , and among those that contracted especially large debts were Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Georgia , Tennessee , North Carolina , South Carolina , Missouri , Virginia and Louisiana . Missouri , for instance , invested $32,000,000 in railroads and received back into the treasury only a little over $6,000,000 of that sum ; Tennessee 's railroad debt amounted to $29,234,000 . The total investments of the States in railroads must have run into the hundreds of millions . The Results of State Aid were comparatively small . This was due in part to the disastrous financial methods followed // by the States , and in part to the aid given to railroads that were built in advance of the needs of the sections they were intended to serve . Some of the States built railroads as government works , but most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere fraction of the original cost . It is not , however , to be inferred that the State funds were altogether wasted . Many parts of the United States were served by railroads earlier than they could have been without public aid . The resources of the Central West and the South were developed somewhat earlier than they could have been without State aid to railroads . Federal Assistance to Railways : Land Grants. ? The United States began to aid railroad construction on a large scale in 1850 by grants from the public domain . The first grant was made to assist the building of a railroad from Chicago to the Gulf . It was thought at that time that the United States did not have the-constitutional power to make grants of land directly to corporations to build railroads within the States ; accordingly , the grants in 1850 were made to Illinois and other States as trustees , the land to be turned over by the States to the railroad company in accordance with the terms of the grant . During the twenty years beginning with 1850 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States to be used by them in assisting railroad construction in the Mississippi Valley . In 1862 , the United States entered upon a second phase of its land-grant policy by donating large tracts of land directly to various railroad companies , to use in building a continuous railroad from the Missouri River through to the Pacific Ocean . The total area of land granted to aid in the construction of the first transcontinental railroad was 33,000,000 acres ? an area considerably greater // than the State of Pennsylvania . Much of the land , however , in this and the other grants to Pacific lines was of small value , because of its location in mountainous and arid regions . Between 1862 and 1871 , when Congress made its last land grant , twenty-three companies received direct donations from the public domain . The total area of land placed at the disposal of the railway companies from 1850 to 1871 was about 159,000,000 acres , an area more than five times that of Pennsylvania . The railroad companies did not meet , nor have they yet fulfilled , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' actually patented or turned over to the companies . Up to June 30 , 1908 , 110,861,353 acres had been patented to the railroad companies from the lands previously granted . The original grants gave assistance to about 15,000 miles of railroads . Aid by National Loans. ? The seven companies which undertook to build the first transcontinental line received , in addition to the 33,000,000 acres of land , large blocks of United States bonds . These companies came into existence during the Civil War , and probably for that reason were given financial assistance . Most of the money went to the Union Pacific Company , which built a line from Omaha to near Ogden , and to the Western Pacific and the Central Pacific companies which constructed a road from Sacramento eastward to the neighborhood of Ogden . These three companies received over $55,000,000 of United States six per cent bonds ; while the other companies interested in this first transcontinental line obtained assistance which brought the total to the seven companies up to $64,623,512 . The aid given was the right to sell United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest on the bonds , and to return the principal to the // United States at maturity . The railroads did not prosper as was expected , the United States had to pay the larger part of the current interest ; and it was supposed for a long time that the companies would not be able to pay the principal when the bonds became due . The Government had a second mortgage on the railroads , and could have taken over the lines had it chosen to do so . Fortunately , this was not necessary ; for the properties had become valuable enough when the bonds fell due , between 1895 and 1899 , to enable the United States to secure from the companies all of the principal of its loans and the larger part of the interest which it had advanced for the companies during the life of the bonds . The results of the Federal aid to railways were most unsatisfactory . It can be seen now that Congress was too eager to dispose of the public lands which have already become so scarce as to make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual settlers . The Mississippi Valley was , it is true , connected with the Pacific coast much earlier than would have been possible without national aid to railroads , but to secure this result unnecessarily large assistance was given by Congress . Moreover , there were shameful scandals connected with the legislation to aid the Pacific railroads . County and Municipal Aid. ? Throughout the Central West , and to some extent in the East , the counties and the cities were so eager to secure new railroads that they issued bonds to secure funds with which to assist the railroad companies . In the State of New York , the counties and municipalties voted $30,000,000 to aid railroads ; in Illinois the sum equaled about $20,000,000 . The exact amount given by the counties and towns and cities in the various States is not known , but it probably amounted to several hundred // million dollars . The sum is much larger than is realized by those who have not studied the subject . The communities that made these large sacrifices did so because they felt that their economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their farms were productive , their manufactures were promising ; but industry could not thrive unless the products could be marketed . The railroads shrewdly took advantage of this situation . A favorite method by which the companies secured a large bonus was that of surveying two alternate routes ? a route through each of two rival towns or counties ? for the purpose of getting the towns or counties to bid against each other for the railroad . Other Public Aid. ? The aid given by the public was by no means all in the form of Government assistance . Enterprising and public-spirited farmers and merchants living along the line of a proposed road were easily persuaded by the company to buy stocks and to assist in the building of the road . In some instances , the stocks thus bought proved to be good investments ; but often they did not , because the companies which built the lines were so financed during the period of construction that bankruptcy of the company and the sale of the property followed closely upon the completion of the road . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their capital . The injustice of this resulted from the fact that the railroads thus aided by individual investors consisted mainly of branch lines , or feeders of the main lines . When a branch line was to be constructed , the company really interested in the line often did not directly finance and build it ; but created a subsidiary corporation whose stock was sold to individual investors . The bankruptcy of the road that built the branch line , enabled the larger company // for which the branch line was really being built to secure its feeder for a relatively small actual investment . The foregoing brief account of public aid to railways in the United States shows that in many sections of the country the early lines were built largely at the expense of the communities and individuals the roads were constructed to serve . In this fact is to be found a partial explanation of the intense opposition to the railroads which developed in the seventies when the people of the West and South realized that the railroads , whose construction they had aided , were giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they were to the merchants and farmers living in and about the smaller towns .  | The Powers of the States and Nation Over Railways. ? The Constitution of the United States gives Congress the power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes . " The commerce carried on entirely within a State is subject to State authority . International and interstate commerce and carriers may be regulated by Congress ; while intrastate commerce and carriers are under the control of the States . Thus , in addition to the Federal Government , there are forty-six States and two territories having power to regulate railroad transportation . Early State Regulation. ? Railway companies , with the exception of those which have built roads within Federal territory , have received their charters from the States ; thus the States have always had it within their power to decide what the railroad companies might or might not do . Some of the early charters attempted to regulate railroads in detail ; but this practice was not continued and there was , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads by the States prior to 1870 . Indeed , from 1850 to 1870 , the prevailing political theory in the United States was that that Government was best that governed least . This theory worked fairly well while the railroad and other corporations were small concerns ; but , when they became // large and powerful , the public realized that the Government must be something more than a policeman . It was found to be necessary for the Government to regulate the relations of railroads with each other and to the public ; and , since 1870 , the tendency has been towards increasing public supervision and control of the services and rates of public carriers . The Legislation of the Seventies. ? It was shortly before 1870 that the public demand for Government regulation of railways became insistent . The main cause of this demand on the part of the public was the discrimination in rates and fares which favored the large cities and big shippers to the real or supposed detriment of the small towns and shippers . It was also felt , particularly in the Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their discriminations ; but that they were higher than they ought to be . The farmers of the West had come to have a large surplus of grain and other farm products which they were eager to market in the East and to export to Europe . Thus they began to clamor for lower rates . The agitation for the regulation and control of the railroads brought about the establishment of State Railroad Commissions . Most of those in the East were given power only to supervise the carriers ; while those in the West and South , for the most part , had authority to issue orders to the railroads and to make and revise rates . The Commission with rower to Supervise and Advise. ? The first commission of the advisory type was created by Massachusetts , in 1869 ; and the other States that adopted commissions of this kind were largely influenced by the provisions of the Massachusetts law . The commission created by Massachusetts consisted of three men appointed by the Governor with the consent of the State Council i the // term of office was three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission was given authority ( a ) to ascertain whether the railway companies were living up to the terms of their charters and were obeying the laws ; ( b ) to supervise the roads with reference to the security and accommodation of the public ; ( c ) to investigate the railroads either upon the commission 's own motion or upon complaint of some shipper or traveler ; ( d ) to , prescribe and enforce a system of keeping accounts ; ( e ) to act as a board of arbitration to settle disputes between the corporations and the public ; and ( f ) to make an annual report , with recommendations , to the Legislature . It will be seen that the Massachusetts commission had no authority to issue orders or to enforce its decisions . The theory of the law was that the railroads would be regulated by the force of public opinion and by enactment of such laws as the Legislature might think necessary . The Commission with Power to Issue Orders and to Make and Revise Rates. ? The railway problems in the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more acute than in the East ; and it was believed by the people of the South and West that the railroad corporations , being public carriers engaged in performing a service of a public nature , should have their services and the charges therefor regulated by public authority . To accomplish his , the so-called " granger " laws were passed . The legislation for the control of railroad rates was given the name of " granger " laws ; because in the early seventies an association of the farmers by the name of the Patrons of Husbandry , the local chapters of which were called granges , was being organized and rapidly built up in the West and South . The agitation for the Government control of the railroads was a movement that started with the people of the smaller // towns as well as with the farmers . After this movement was under way it was taken up and carried forward by the " grangers . " The " Granger " Laws were of two kinds : those which fixed railway rates by stating in acts of legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual practice was for the State to establish a railroad commission with power either to prescribe and enforce schedules of rates , or with power to revise the rates after the charges had been put into force by the railroad companies . The so-called Potter law , passed by the State of Wisconsin in 1874 , was a type of the laws fixing rates by act of Legislature . The State of Illinois , by laws which it passed in 1871 and 1873 , created a railroad commission whose duty it was to prescribe a " schedule of reasonable maximum rates of charges for the transportation of passengers and freight . " This Illinois law , which may be taken as a type of those which created " commissions with power , " gave to the railroad commission all the authority possessed by the similar body in Massachusetts ; and , in addition thereto , the power to prescribe rates and to prosecute the railroad companies in the courts for failure to obey the orders of the commission either in regard to rates or concerning other matters over which the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the granger laws in the courts , and every effort was made to prove the laws unconstitutional ; but , in 1877 , the united States Supreme Court held the laws to be valid and declared that the States had authority to regulate railway services and charges . The main principles for which the " grangers " contended were then upheld , and have since been extended by State and national legislation and by judicial decisions . The Present Commissions. ? At the present time , as is // shown by the accompanying map , there are only six States ? Delaware , Maryland , West Virginia , Idaho , Wyoming , and Utah ? and two territories , Arizona and New Mexico , that have no railway commissions . The map shows the type of commission established by each State . There are but a few States now having the Massachusetts type of commission with only advisory powers . By far the greater number have commissions with power to fix or revise rates ; and of such commissions there are three subclasses : The largest of these three subclasses is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads ; the second subclass of commissions with power is represented by Virginia , North Carolina and Oklahoma , which States have given their commissions authority over corporations generally . The third and latest form of the mandatory commission is one having jurisdiction over public utilities ? steam and electric railways , telegraph and telephone companies , and other municipal public service corporations . Wisconsin and New York have public service commissions . The Public Service Commission. ? The establishment of State commissions with authority over street railways and municipal and other public service corporations as well as over steam railroads , marks a distinct step forward in dealing with the large problem of public regulation of corporations . The American people are indebted to New York State for having been the first one to create a public body of this character . In 1906 , New York established two public service commissions , one with jurisdiction over the city of Greater New York and the other with authority over the remainder of the State . These bodies are intrusted with the regulation of the services and the charges , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas and electric lighting corporations . Much has al-Figure // ready been accomplished . Possibly , the most important work has been that of prescribing a uniform system of accounting , whereby the operations of the railways and their financial methods are made known to the public , and are thus subjected to regulation both by law and by public opinion . It was fortunate for Greater New York that this public service commission was created shortly before the company controlling the surface street railways of the city went into bankruptcy as the result of its previous reckless financiering . The interests of the public are being safeguarded , and the transportation facilities of this greatest center of population in America will be better in the future ; because there has been a commisson with powers sufficient to enable it to assist in reconstituting the street railway system of New York . Present Tendencies in the State Regulation of Railways. ? Nearly all of the commissions established since 1890 have been given power to enforce their orders and to revise rates . The States are disposed to give their commissions greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting , and of regulating the issue of stocks and bonds . The commissions now have from three to five members ; the salaries are much larger than were formerly thought necessary ; and the members are usually appointed by the Governor instead of being elected by the voters of the State as was frequently the case with the early commissions . These changes have resulted in inducing men of higher standing to become members of State railroad commissions . The most important , as well as the latest tendency is to give the same body of men authority over steam railroads , electric railways , and public utilities generally . As the State commissioners are given larger powers and wider authority , their // dignity is enhanced and their opportunities for serving the public are increased . The States are unquestionably making real headway in the needful work of bringing public service corporations under conservative but effective Government regulation .  | Railway Regulation a National Problem. ? Not long after the States took up the work of railway regulation , which was in the early seventies , the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the problems the States were endeavoring to solve were in large part inseparably connected with interstate commerce over which the Federal Government had sole jurisdiction . It was seen to be necessary for the States and the National Government to cooperate in the work of railway regulation ; because the authority of each State was limited to the services connected with , and charges for , traffic that did not pass its boundaries . It is true that some of the State laws , passed before Congress took action , really applied indirectly and more or less directly to interstate as well as intrastate railway traffic ; but , in 1886 , the United States Supreme Court , in a ease involving the authority of the Illinois Railway Commission , held that the authority of the State was limited to the regulation of traffic within its boundaries . The Movement for Federal Regulation of Railways. ? Upon a recommendation made by President Grant in his annual message in 1872 , the Senate of the United States appointed a committee which made a thorough investigation of the question of Federal railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in favor of Federal Legislation . Action , however , was not taken by Congress until 1887 , by which time the problem of railway control had been thoroughly investigated by another Senate committee , whose report was submitted in 1886 . This Cullom report , so named from its chairman , was accompanied by a bill for the Federal regulation of railways , and this bill with various amendments became the Interstate Commerce Act which was enacted in 1887 . The Interstate Commerce Act. ? The act of 1887 has been strengthened frorn tirnc to time by amendments , the most important of which were the Elkins Act of 1903 and the llepburn Act of 1906 . The former law was aimed particularly at the prevention . of discriminations ; whereas the Hepburn Act gave the Interstate Commerce Commission , which had been created by the act of 1887 , the power to revise railway rates and to prescribe uniform accounting . The main provisions of the Interstate Commerce Law , as now amended , are as follows : The law applies to passenger and freight traffic carried by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express- and sleeping-car companies , to pipe lines , and to private car lines . It does not apply to the traffic carried upon all water routes . It is made unlawful to charge extortionate rates or those which unjustly discriminate between places , persons , or commodities . Free passes are prohibited , and railway companies are not allowed to be producers of any commodities they carry , with the exception of lumber . It is unlawful for a carrier to " receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of passengers or like kinds of property , under substantially similar circumstances and conditions , for a shorter than // for a longer distance over the same line , in the same direction , the shorter being included within the longer distance . " But the commission has power to suspend the enforcement of this provision in the case of carriers that have to meet exceptional conditions of competition . This is known as the " long-and-short-haul " clause . Railways are not allowed to pool their freight traffic or the earnings from their freight or passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission . No rates can be put into force until thirty days after they have been filed , nor can they be changed except upon thirty days ' notice to the commission , unless the commission gives permission to the carriers to change the rates in less than thirty days . The penalty for violating this act is a fine of $5,000 for each offense . If the offense be an unlawful discrimination in rates or charges , this penalty may be increased by imprisoning the guilty officials for a term not exceeding two years , and the offending corporations may be subjected to a fine of $1,000 to $20,000 for each day during which the offense is committed . The administration and enforcement of the act is intrusted to an Interstate Commerce Commission of seven members . One member is appointed each year for the term of seven years at a salary of $10,000 per annum . The principal office of the commission is in Washington , D. C. The commission has the power to investigate the railways either upon complaint or upon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , upon complaint and after investigation , it can require the carriers to change the fares or rates that have been found to be unreasonable . The equity of the commission 's order as to // rates can be tested in a Federal Court by formal proceedings instituted by the carriers . Carriers must obey the orders of the commission within thirty days , unless the carriers can secure from a Federal Court an injunction suspending or annulling the commission 's order . Railways subject to the act must make monthly reports to the commission regarding accidents , operating revenues , and expenses ; and must submit an annual report containing detailed information concerning practically every phase of their operations and finances . All the accounts kept by railway companies must be in accordance with a uniform system prescribed by the commission , which has the power to inspect the books of the railways , and thus to enforce its system of uniform accounting . Railway Regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission. ? The Interstate Commerce Commission accomplishes its difficult task of regulating the railways by means of three general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these is its power of investigation . In the fullest sense of the word , the railway business is now public and not secret . The commission is able to inform itself , the Congress , and the public fully in regard to the services and practices of interstate carriers . This enables the commission to correct abuses , and , what is probably of more consequence , it enables an enlightened public opinion to exercise a large corrective influence over the transportation business . The hearing of complaints and the adjustment of rates and fares is the second great function of the commission . It may not only investigate and recommend , it can also correct . There is no economic problem of greater impor144 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION tance to the people of the United States than an equitable adjustment of railway charges among competing localities . Justice can not be secured except by public regulation , and Congress has wisely given the commission the power to adjust rates and fares . The Interstate Commerce Commission regulates the services and accounts , and thus exercises a positive , constructive influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given authority over the accounts of railway companies it has been put in a position where it can improve the business and financial methods of our railway companies . Every company is obliged to conform to the accounting standards of the best companies . The commission was given control over accounting in 1906 , but several years earlier it had been given supervision over equipment as regards safety appliances . Recently , Congress has given the commission the duty of seeking to bring about a more rapid introduction of an effective system of block signaling and of train control on all railroads in the United States . Thus the commission is developing administrative duties as regards railway operations as well as concerning railroad accounting . The Congress has not yet given the commission power to regulate the issue of railroad stocks and bonds and to supervise financial methods ; it is probable , however , that these powers also will be given to the commission in the near future . Results Accomplished ? The Future Ideal. ? The problem of regulating the vast transportation business of the country seemed almost impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1887 , have met with more than expected success . Publicity has been given to the railway service , unjust practices have been made illegal , and the laws have become enforceable . Our present ability to enRAILWAY // force law is due to a change in public sentiment . In America only those laws can be enforced that give expression to public opinion . In order to make unjust railway discriminations impossible , it was necessary that the public should condemn , as immoral , secret discriminations and other illegal practices of common carriers . It augurs well for the future that our ethical standards now are such that we are disposed to apply to the public service corporation the same standards of business conduct that we apply to the Government in its dealings with its citizens and with dif ? ferent sections of the country .  | The Courts Determine the Meaning and Scope of Laws. ? Although the State laws are made by legislatures and the governors , and the Federal laws by the Congress and the President , it is the courts that decide what those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes about that the laws on some subjects are , to a large extent , " court made , " and this is particularly true of the laws regulating railroad services and charges . This fact may be illustrated by reference to a decision of the United States Supreme Court , in 1897 , in which it was held illegal for the Trans-Missouri Freight Association to fix and enforce rates on the competitive traffic of the roads that were members of the association . The court reached this decision , because it decided that the Sherman antitrust law , passed July 2 , 1890 , to prevent the restraint of trade by the trusts , applied to railroad rate agreements ; although it is quite certain that Congress did not have the railroads in mind when the law was enacted . The meaning of practically every section of the Interstate Commerce acts of 1887 and subsequent years has been passed upon by court decisions , and the scope of these laws has , in many particulars , been narrowed , and in others widened by court interpretation . Sources of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution , from the statutes , and // from the accepted body of legal precedents which is called the common law . The basis of the power of the Federal courts is the United States Constitution ; whereas a State court is subject both to the Federal Constitution and to the constitution of its own State . Statutory laws are increased and amended year by year , and they deal with the major share of individual and corporate rights and duties . There are , however , numerous relationships , not covered by statute law , which are regulated by the courts through the equity powers which they exercise in accordance with the principles of common law . The authority which the courts have been given by statutes is definite and fixed ; but the scope of equity jurisdiction , except where determined at certain points by law , may be extended at the will of the judiciary . Equity Powers of the United States Courts over Rates , ? This helps to explain why it has been in the exercise of their equity powers that the courts have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law fixing a railroad rate involves a question in equity as to the reasonableness of the rate thus fixed , and this is equally true when the rates are fixed by State commissions or by the Interstate Commerce Commission . The fifth amendment to the Constitution of the United States stipulates that no person " shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . " This limits the power of Congress . The fourteenth amendment limits the authority of the States by stipulating that no State " shall deprive any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . " It has been decided that the word " person , " as used in the Constitution , applies to those artificial persons created by law which we // call corporations . It will thus be seen that neither the Congress nor State legislatures can pass a law fixing railroad rates so low as to destroy the value of the property of railroad companies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroads under the Constitution include the right to a reasonable profit from the property . In other words , railroad rates can not be so low as to prevent the railroads from securing a fair return on their investment . The Doctrine of Judicial Review. ? The principles laid down in the preceding paragraph are popularly called the doctrine of judicial review . In its present form this doctrine is that the United States courts have the power to pass upon the reasonableness of any rate fixed by a State or by Federal authority . If a State legislature or State railway commission fixes rates so low that the carriers think the rates unreasonable , the carriers may now appeal directly to the United States courts for the annulment of the State laws on the ground that they violate the Federal Constitution . It goes without saying that the United States courts can determine the reasonableness or constitutionality of any rates which may be fixed either by the Congress or by the Interstate Commerce Commission acting for and under the authority of Congress . All legislative rates , State or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts can decide what rates are and what are not reasonable . Prevention of Extortionate Railway Rates. ? If a railroad charges a shipper an extortionate rate on traffic from one point to another place in the same State , the shipper may sue the railroad company in the State courts to recover damages . This is a case between two " persons " of the same State , and can be finally settled by the State supreme // court . If the shipment be from one State to another , the case against the railroad company must be brought in the Federal courts ; because the United States Government has jurisdiction over interstate commerce . If a railroad company announces an increase in rates that the shippers think will make the charges extortionate , the persons whose business is in danger of injury from the proposed rates may appeal to the courts for an injunction ordering the railroad not to make the proposed increase in charges . If the court thinks that the prayer for an injunction is justified , it may issue a temporary injunction ordering the railroads not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the court ; after such argument , the temporary injunction will be dismissed if not found to have ' valid reasons back of it , or will be made permanent if the court decides that the public interests will suffer by the higher rates proposed by the carrier . Stated in a word , the courts may enjoin railroad companies from charging extortionate rates . Prevention of Rate Wars. ? A violent rate war with the consequent excessive cutting of rates may be as destructive of property as extortionate rates would be . If the roads leading to one city reduce the rates and fares below those prevailing to and from another competitive city , the latter place may lose its business , and its merchants and manufacturers may suffer heavy losses . A prolonged war of rates between two railroads , furthermore , may so reduce the revenues of the contestants as to destroy the market value of their bonds , and the creditors of the companies may thus lose their investments . Such violent and prolonged rate wars as would produce those results seldom occur at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same power to prevent the railroads // from charging destructively low rates that they have to order them not to make their rates extortionate . A violent rate war between the Seaboard Air Line and the Southern Railway Company in 1896 was stopped by injunctions of the courts . The Powers of the State and Federal Courts over Railway Charges may be summarized as follows : The State courts , having jurisdiction over controversies between citizens of the commonwealth , may pass upon the reasonableness of the rates charged by the railways upon traffic moved entirely within the State . The State courts may also pass upon the constitutionality or reasonableness of the rates fixed by a State Legislature or a State Commission ? this question , however , may also be decided by the Federal courts . The United States courts may determine the reasonableness of rates fixed by the railroads upon interstate traffic ; and may pass upon the constitutionality of charges fixed by Congress , by the Interstate Commerce Commission , by State legislatures , and by State railroad commissions . As explained above , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers from charging extortionately high , or destructively low , rates . Court Injunctions in Labor Disputes. ? It is lawful for men , who have not made a contract to give their employers notice of intention to quit work , to quit employment at any time ; and men may do this either individually or in a body . It is lawful for men to strike , provided they do so to better their condition , and without a declared intention to injure their employers . The courts , however , may enjoin strikers from doing anything to injure their employers and from using force to prevent men from taking the places formerly held by strikers . This is the general law of strikes . // The powers of the courts to issue injunctions in disputes between railroad companies and their employees is strengthened by the fact that the United States Government has the power to regulate interstate commerce . The Federal courts may enjoin men from interfering with trains engaged in handling interstate commerce ; and the law furthermore provides specific penalties for interfering with the transportation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the entire army of the United States under the command of the President . It is thus a serious matter for strikers to disregard the injunctions of the United States courts issued to preserve order during railway labor strikes . Management of Insolvent Roads ; Railway Receiverships. ? When a railroad company becomes insolvent ? i. e. , when it can not pay the interest on its debt or meet its other financial obligations ? the creditors of the road may ask a court to take possession of the property . If the court grants the request of the creditors , the property is taken from the management of the directors and officers of the company and put in charge of an officer of the court called a receiver . If the company is not hopelessly insolvent , the road will be operated by the receiver , who will cooperate with the creditors and the owners of the road in reorganizing the company and placing it on a solvent financial basis . If , however , the liabilities of the company are found to be so great as to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court will instruct the receiver to sell the property for the benefit of the creditors ; but whether the property is sold or not every effort will be made to keep the railroad in operation , because the value of the property invested in a railroad depends almost en152 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION tirely upon what it can earn as a railroad . It can not be used for other purposes . Railroad construction in the United States was carried on with great rapidity and without any Government supervision of stock and bond issues . Many roads were overcapitalized , and not a few of them were built ahead of business needs . The result of this has been that during periods of financial crises , as from 1873 to 1878 , and from 1893 to 1898 , a large number of railway companies have become insolvent , and have thus been brought temporarily under the management of the courts . During the eighteen months ending July 4 , 1894 , 43,000 miles of railroad ? twenty-four per cent of the total mileage in the country ? was taken in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the roads became solvent ; but even under the present improved conditions , a business depression such as began in the latter part of 1907 and lasted through the following year , may force several thousand miles of railroad into receiverships . However , as our railroads become stronger and their financial methods more conservative , the duties of the courts in managing insolvent roads will be steadily lessened .  | Government Regulation of Railways a Permanent and Double Problem. ? The regulation of the railways is a problem with which the Government of every country has to deal ; moreover , it is a problem , which , like poverty , can not be finally disposed of . In dealing with this question the State has two duties to perform : one is properly to adjust the relations of the carriers with each other , and the other is to bring about and maintain equitable treatment of the public by the carrier . This twofold problem may be dealt with in either one of two ways : the Government may own and operate the railroads , or . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law to perform the work of public carriage . The former method has been adopted by a majority of the countries , but in the United States the plan of private ownership and Government regulation has prevailed . The Problem of Government Regulation Defined. ? The essence of the problem of Government regulation consists in harmonizing as far as possible the interests of private corporations of a quasi public character , engaged for profit in the performance of a service of a public nature , with the interests of the individuals , the localities , and the general public served by the carriers . Such a problem as this // must necessarily be a permanent one , because it involves the enforcement of equity . Equity is a matter of relationship , and thus varies with changes in the things compared . What is equity to-day may not be equity to-morrow ; a rate that was reasonable five years ago may be unjust at the present time ; a service that was adequate and reasonable in 1900 may be quite otherwise in 1910 . These are the questions which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the Government can never be completed ? it remains a permanent duty . Government Ownership a Question of Expediency , Not of Principle. ? Whether the railroad problem shall be dealt with by State ownership or Government regulation is a question of expediency . In Germany , the several States of the empire have succeeded admirably with the ownership and operation of the railroads . Other countries have had a fair degree of success . On the other hand Government regulation of railway corporations has been successful in Great Britain , and promises to prove so in the United States . There are so many factors involved in reaching an accurate decision as to which of the two policies it is wise for any particular Government to adopt , that it will be well to summarize the arguments for and against State ownership and operation of the railways . The arguments will be stated with particular reference to the United States . ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RAILWAYS IN TIHE UNITED STATES ( 1 ) The leading argument in favor of State ownership and operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and commodities can thereby be // prevented . It is reasonable to suppose that the Government will manage the railroads with the same impartiality that it conducts the post office . In a well-conducted Government , it is probable that favoritism will not exist ; and that the Government will tolerate only such discriminations as are in the public interest . ( 2 ) When the Government operates the railroads it can adjust charges with reference to the maximum development of industry and commerce , or with regard to the promotion of social progress , or with a view to increasing the strength and efficiency of the army . In Prussia the Government has sought with remarkable success to promote all three of these aims . Railroad rates are made a part of the protective tariff system , and they are so adjusted as to favor foreign trade , to build up the iron industries of the western part of the country , and to further the agricultural development in the eastern and southeastern portions of Prussia . Passenger fares have been arranged with reference to increasing the travel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities . From the early days of Bismarck 's power to the present time , the construction and operation of the railroads of Prussia and other German States have been made to serve the military strength of the country . ( 3 ) It is argued that rates and fares can and will be lower under Government ownership and operation ; for the reasons that the Government will not seek to make more than fair profits , and , having a monopoly of the entire system within the country , it can avoid many of the expenses due to competition and to the maintenance of a large number of separate and rival corporations . In connection with this argument , however , it should be remembered that the Government can not charge lower rates // than private corporations unless it is equally efficient in the management of the railroads . Unless the Government administration is both honest and efficient , its expenses will be greater than they are under private management . It is a well-known fact , moreover , that the Government , particularly in democratic countries , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations do . This may be desirable from a social point of view , but it helps to increase the expenses of Government operation , and tends to prevent a reduction of rates and fares . ( 4 ) The nationalization of the railroads converts the more or less speculative stocks and bonds of railroad corporations into sound investment securities . Railway capital takes the form of Government bonds in which individuals , insurance , and trust companies may safely invest their accumulating surplus . ( 5 ) The substitution of Government bonds for the securities of corporations takes those securities out of the stock market and thus limits the field of speculation . It is believed by many that the influence of the stock market is demoralizing and that anything tending to limit its operations will be a public benefit . ( 6 ) The nationalization of the railroads has the support of the advocates of socialism and also of others who feel that the present unsatisfactory distribution of wealth among different classes of people calls for vigorous corrective measures on the part of the Government . To take $18,000,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ownership of the public as a whole , would unquestionably limit somewhat the present inequality in the wealth of different social classes . There is , moreover , no other large body of wealth that could be more readily socialized. // ARGUMENTS AGAINST GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RAILWAYS IN THE UNITED STATES ( 1 ) With minor exceptions , the policy of both the United States and the States has been to interfere as little as possible with private management of transportation . Formerly , there was much opposition even to Government regulation of the corporations engaged in performing the public service of railway transportation ; latterly , we have come to realize that efficient Government regulation is necessary ; but a majority of the American people still hold to the political theory that interference should not go beyond the point of absolute necessity ; accordingly , the nationalization of railroads would be considered a radical step and one opposed to our traditional policy . This argument , however , has lost much of its force during recent years with the unavoidable extension of the functions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States would increase the number of Government employees by nearly a million and a half , most of whom are voters . It is claimed that this throng of men might be so manipulated as to corrupt the ballot . The danger of this is much less now than it would have been under the old spoils system , and the possibilities of political leaders controlling the votes of Government employees is growing less with the increase in the intelligence and independence of the individual voter . ( 3 ) The opponents of the nationalization of railways argue that the Government would develop our railways more slowly than private corporations would , and that the // Government would be apt to construct new lines mainly in those sections of the country having the greatest political influence . This might be true in some countries but probably would not be in the United States . ( 4 ) The advocates of private railways assert that the rates upon the Government roads are too rigid . It is claimed both that the rate systems worked out by corporations are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with economic conditions . It is true that rates ought to be kept in adjustment with economic needs , but a close study of the question will convince an impartial student that rates may be too flexible as well as too stable . The increasing tendency at present in countries where the railroads are operated by private corporations is toward a greater stability in rates . Moreover , it is equally true that the Government machinery may bring about an excellent adjustment of railway charges to industrial conditions . The Prussian Government , with the assistance of advisory councils made up of representatives of the business interests in all the sections of the country , has succeeded admirably in rate making ; and there is surprisingly little complaint on the part of the shipping and traveling public in that country . ( 5 ) The strongest argument against the nationalization of railways in the United States is that our Government would be less economical and less efficient in the management of the railroads than the private corporations are . Ordinarily , Government works are more expensive than private works . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government does . The employee of the corporation is held up to a higher degree of effort than is the public servant . Thus while some of the expenses which corporations now incur would be avoided by // the nationalization of railroads , the total expense would probably be increased under Government management . ( 6 ) While the pressure for a reduction of rates would be strong , it is not probable that the Government could perform the transportation service at lower rates and fares than now prevail ; indeed , it is probable that the ultimate , if not the early , effect of Government management in the United States would be higher charges than well-regulated private corporations would need to exact of the public . Nationalization of Our Railways Not Now Expedient. ? In order to decide whether the United States ought to acquire and operate the railroads within the country it is necessary to answer three questions : ( 1 ) Could the Government administer the railways honestly ? ( 2 ) Could it do this as efficiently as private corporations can ? ( 3 ) Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to the first of these questions must be an uncertain one . The nationalization of our railroads would place an immense strain upon the administrative machinery of the Federal Government ; whether honesty could be maintained is questionable ? it would at least be a dangerous experiment . The answer to the second query must be negative . Private corporations in the United States are unquestionably more efficient than the Government could be . The answer to the third question is affirmative . Satisfactory progress is being made by the United States Government and by several of the States in the regulation of the railways . In a word , the success of Government regulation in the United States , while incomplete , is sufficient to justify the belief that the control of.our railroads can be accomplished by regulation , and that nationalization is neither necessary nor desirable at the present time .  | Importance of Electric Railway Transportation in the United States. ? At the end of two decades of growth the electric railways carried 9,533,080,766 passengers in one year , many times the number transported on steam railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the electric cars is only a few cents , the earnings of electric railways are about two thirds the income received by steam roads from their passenger traffic . The advance made by electric railways is the result of the growth both of urban transportation and also of suburban and interurban traffic . The rapid transit which the electric lines gave to the cities enabled the cities to grow rapidly and spread widely , and this in turn has brought an ever enlarging volume of traffic to the street railways . The economy with which electric roads could be built along highways and the frequency of the service they could offer to the public caused such a large number of interurban lines to be constructed as to give the electric railways a greater mileage in some States than the steam railroads have . The substitution of the electric for the steam locomotive within the limits of large cities has been begun on an extensive scale in New York , and in course of time will he carried out in all the other great cities . This , in turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric power for the passenger service on trunk-line railroads // where the traffic is heavy . The electric railway is developing much more rapidly than the steam railroad and it is still in the early stages of its growth . The main facts regarding electric railway transportation will be presented in this and the three following chapters . The Predecessors of the Electric Railway. ? The first organized service for the transportation of passengers in cities was supplied by omnibus lines , which began to run in New York City in 1830 , and in Philadelphia the following year . About twenty years later the street railway and horse cars made their appearance in New York . The first street railway line in Boston received its charter in 1853 ; five years later the first line began operation in Philadellihia ; and in 1859 Chicago had a street-railway service . These horse-car lines provided a service of four or five miles an hour , which answered very well in cities of moderate size . By 1870 , however , several American cities had become so large as to have urgent need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with steam locomotives began to be constructed about 1870 to furnish more rapid transit than could be secured without animal traction . The first city to construct a cable line was San Francisco whose hilly location made horse cars impracticable on many of its streets . San Francisco 's first cable line was opened in 1873 . The next city to have cable traction was Chicago , whose first line began running in 1878 . Philadelphia 's cable line was opened in 1884 . New York City took the lead in the use of elevated railways . The long distance from the lower end of Manhattan Island to the residential portions of New York , and the congested condition of its streets made it absolutely necessary to provide rapid transit by elevated roads . The first franchise for an elevated street railway in New York // was granted in 1867 , other lines followed in quick succession , and by 1879 New York City 's system of elevated roads was nearly completed . The first plan was to use cable traction upon these elevated lines , but it was decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced by electricity . In Chicago the construction of elevated railroads began in 1888 ; Boston 's excellent system of elevated roads was opened in 1903 ; and Philadelphia 's line in 1907 . The Origin of the Electric Railway : The Invention of the Motor. ? It was the dynamo which was invented in 1864 that subsequently made possible the use of electricity to propel railway cars ; but nearly twenty-five years were required to improve the dynamo and adapt it to the streetrailway service . Among the men who did the most to accomplish this important work were Stephen D. Field , Thomas A. Edison and Frank S. Sprague in the United States , and Siemens &; Ilalske in Germany . Experiments with short electric-car lines were being carried on by different people in various places after 1880 . In 1888 , Sprague began the successful operation of an electric trolley in Richmond , Va . This same year , Bentley &; Knight installed an electric line in Allegheny City , Pa. , and the Thompson-Houston Company started a service in Washington . The success of these roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the great West End System in Boston to replace horse cars with electric instead of cable traction . After 1888 , the growth of electric mileage was rapid . The Improvement of the Motor. ? The first motors were naturally crude and of low-power efficiency . Experience early showed that the motor must be carried on the trucks ? not in the cars ? and that the truck carrying the motor // must be separate from the body of the car . It was thus necessary to devise a motor of sufficient power that was small enough to be placed between the floor of the car and the axles of the trucks . This problem was solved by making the motors small , running them at high speed and gearing them down to the axles , at first by double reduction and later by a single gearing . The motor had to be supported flexibly in order to prevent destructive jolting , and yet be suspended concentrically with reference to the axle . Numerous improvements were made in the motor year by year whereby its power was increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low motor speed was made possible . The inertia of moving parts was lessened and sparks were prevented by better commutation . Among the many important improvements introduced was the controller , by which the motorman regulates the speed of the car ; and the magnetic circuit breaker for the proBALDWIN-WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE . Weight 70,000 pounds . // tection of the dynamos against lightning and the motors against excessive currents . The Electric Car. ? By 1870 , the standard two-horse car was sixteen feet long , had relatively large windows , a monitor roof , and a seating capacity for twenty-two persons . Subsequent to this , only minor improvements were made in the designs of the horse cars ; but when electric traction was introduced there was an immediate demand for longer and more spacious cars . It was found by experience that the limit for the length of four-wheel closed cars was 20 feet , and for open cars , 25 to 30 feet , with a total weight of 20,000 pounds for body and trucks . Early in the nineties , the demand for larger cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels and two trucks . The general design of these cars is similar to the steam railway coach . In Europe , the double-deck car is popular in many cities , but it has not been used in America , because the length of time taken by passengers to dismount from the roof seats reduces the speed of the ear below the average necessary in American cities , where distances are exceptionally great . The Track. ? The early street-railway tracks had rails consisting of wooden stringers surfaced with iron . After 1880 , light T rails , weighing 25 to 60 pounds per yard , were . used in many cities . With the introduction of electric cars , the use of girder rails , the heaviest of which now weigh 141 pounds to the yard , became general . Of the several designs of girder rails , the grooved rail is the one most favored ; because wagons may easily pass to and from the rails without difficulty . Suburban and interurban lines are laid with T rails such as are used on steam railroad tracks . The underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal conductor for the electric current is plaoed in a conduit which is framed in , and supported by , large metal cross-yokes that carry the rails of the track . Thus each cross-yoke forms a section of the conduit and also serves as a cross-tie . The use of the conduit came Pater than the overhead trolley , because of the great expense and also because of the difficulty of insulating the conductor in the conduit . The insulation of the conductor bars is secured by placing them near the top of a conduit large enough to carry the water that may enter the conduit off to the street sewers with which the conduit is connected at frequent intervals . The conduit system is much preferable to the overhead trolley , because overhead wires are dangerous and disfigure the street . New York , Washington , and some other cities have wisely refused to permit overhead trolleys in their streets . The Electric Locomotive and the Multiple Unit Train. ? There are three methods by which electricity may be employed to move cars : ( 1 ) The cars may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street-railway service . ( 2 ) An electric locomotive may be employed to haul a train of cars or " trailers . " ( 3 ) Two or more cars , each supplied with motors , and capable of being operated singly , may be united into a train , and the train may be managed as a unit by a single motorman . This was named the multiple unit system by its inventor , Frank J. Sprague . It might also be called the electric train . As early as 1882 , electric locomotives were used for hauling cars in mines . The next use was for subways and tunnels . When the City &; South London Railway was opened for traffic in 1890 , it was decided to adopt electric locomotives instead of cables for handling trains . The success of this London subway caused the electric locoORIGIN // motive to be used in other subways and tunnels where the avoidance of smoke and gases was necessary . Upon elevated street railways and on interurban lines where electric cars are run in trains , the Sprague multiple unit system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each truck of the train , high speed may be obtained quickly without any motor being of high power . Moreover , the motors being distributed throughout the I3ALDWIN-WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE FOR MINE SERVICE . Weight , 30,000 pounds . train , none of the cars needs to be so heavy as a locomotive must be . The multiple-unit train became a possibility about 1900 , and it marked an important step forward in the progress of mechanical traction . Transmission of the Current. ? The most important advances now being made in the application of electricity to transportation and industry are in connection with the transmission of the current . It has now become possible to transmit a high voltage alternating current from 50 to 150 miles , and to transform the current locally at many points // into a continuous current at a low voltage . Where water power is available , electricity can be generated economically and can be distributed over a wide area . The Triumph of the Electric Railway. ? In 1890 , seventenths of the total single track mileage of street railways in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARTFORD RAILROAD . Weight , 204,000 pounds ; 1,000 horse power . with the exception of a few short cable lines , electric traction occupies the field . The transition from animal to mechanical traction was quickly made , because of the greater economy and efficiency of the electric railway . This may be illustrated by reference to the operating expenses of the street railways of Massachusetts before and after the adoption of electricity . In 1888 there were 553 // miles of horse-car lines in that State and no electric roads . At that time the ratio of operating expenses to gross receipts was 81.07 per cent . In 1902 there were no horsecar lines in Massachusetts and there were 2,484 track miles of electric roads . At that time , the operating expenses had fallen to 69.5 per cent of the gross receipts ; and this was true in spite of the fact that one half of the electric-railway mileage was in rural districts and small towns where the ratio of operating expenses was higher than in the large cities where the traffic is heavier . This reduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the result of another factor . The electric railway has brought about such a large increase in traffic that gross receipts have risen more rapidly than have operating costs . In the street-railway service , as in most lines of business , the cost per unit of service or product grows smaller with the increase in the volume of business .  | Mileage and Services of Street Railways. ? Although electric railways have become interurban , their chief services still consist of carrying passengers through the streets of cities and between the cities and their important suburbs . The line mileage of the street railways in a large city is surprisingly great . In New York there were at the beginning of 1908 , 603 line miles of surface electric roads , 67 line miles of elevated roads , and 22 miles of subways . The passengers carried on these roads of New York were 1,330,776,165 . In Philadelphia the street-railway mileage is 620 , and the number of passengers carried in 1908 was 512,869,023 . In the largest cities , three classes of street railways are employed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subways . While the surface lines will always have the largest mileage , and in most cities the greater volume of traffic , New York and Chicago have long been obliged to make extensive use of elevated roads ; and , during recent years , such roads have been constructed in Boston and Philadelphia . The elevated road is a permanent part of our urban transportation system . Subways also will be used more and more in the future . The pronounced success of the subways that have been opened in New York , Boston and Philadelphia , and the even greater success of subways in foreign cities , make it certain that // wherever the traffic is heavy enough to warrant the investment , the tendency will be to construct subways to provide rapid transit over the longer routes within crowded cities . Consolidated Management of Street Railways. ? In every large city of the United States , many street railway companies have received charters for street railways and have constructed lines . It was supposed in the earlier decades of street-railway construction that if the State granted charters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , the companies would compete with each other and thus give the public better service and cheaper fares as a result of competition . It was soon found , however , that these several companies tended to consolidate ; and at the Present time , in practically every large city the various // street-railway companies have been brought together under a single control . In Philadelphia , for instance , all the street railways are owned by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company ; in Boston , the Boston Elevated controls all the lines ; and in New York the **25;255;TOOLONG Company has absorbed all the lines . Financial Methods Employed in Consolidation. ? In most States , with the exception of Massachusetts , financiers have been allowed to employ such methods in consolidating street railways as they chose to adopt . The promoters of financial syndicates discovered as long ago as 1880 that the rapid growth of cities and the consequent increase of street-railway traffic made it possible for them to issue securities much in excess of the actual investment in street railways . Moreover , when the traction company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found possible for the traction company to float large blocks of stocks or bonds in addition to the securities of the consolidated roads . Thus , step by step , the capitalization of street railways has been increased , except where prevented by public authority ; until at the present time the traction company in nearly every American city is struggling along under an exceptionally burdensome load of capital . Meanwhile , the public is being less efficiently served than it might be had those formerly in control of the street-railway business been prevented from issuing unlimited quantities of stocks and bonds . The Street Railway Service and Fares are a Monopoly in Each City. ? Street-railway transportation has always been a monopoly service even when there were several companies operating in the same city . At the present time , the consolidation of the street railways in each city strengthens this monopoly , not because the nature of the monopoly has // been changed , but because the consolidated company possessing the monopoly is more powerful than its several predecessors individually or collectively were . Street-railway monopoly rests upon four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State necessarily gives a streetrailway company the exclusive right over certain streets and thus within certain sections of the city . ( 2 ) Streetrailway companies serving different sections of a city can not compete with each other to much extent , because people living in a Nrtieular section of a large city must patronize the company serving that municipal district . ( 3 ) Streetrailway transportation is a service for which there is universal demand and for which there is no substitute . Conditions or life in our cities are now such that the street railways ? surface , elevated , and subway ? must be used by // practically everybody . ( 4 ) Competition in so far as it is possible among street railways , is readily set aside by agreements as to fares or by the consolidation of the lines . In Philadelphia , for instance , thirty-nine companies were chartered between 1857 and 1874 , and most of these companies constructed lines . But in 1859 there was organized the Board of Presidents of City Passenger Railway Companies and this board so completely regulated the fares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Street Railway Fares. ? In the United States , the streetrailway fare is usually five cents for a single ride within the city limits regardless of distance . In many cities , six tickets are sold for twenty-five cents ; and there are some places where tickets are sold at reduced rates during the morning and evening rush hours . In some cities , free transfers are given ; but in several of the large cities a transfer ticket costs from six to eight cents instead of five cents . In Europe , with few exceptions , street-railway fares vary with distance . The fare for the shortest trip is from one cent to two and a half cents , and for the longest rides seldom more than six cents . This plan of grading streetrailway charges with reference to distance works admirably in the cities of Europe where many people live at or near their places of business , and where the average distance people ride upon the street cars is much shorter than the average length of the trip on American street railways . Our cities spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections well away from the centers of business . These differences between American and European cities account for the dissimilar systems of street-railway charges . Public Regulation or City Ownership Necessary. ? From // what has been said in this chapter , it is evident that the street-railway service when performed by private corporations must be carefully regulated by the public . Whether it is a better plan to have the service performed by carefully regulated public-service corporations , or to adopt municipal ownership and operation of street railways depends almost entirely upon whether the city government is or is not honest and efficient . Since 1890 , two thirds of the street railways in Great Britain have been taken over by the cities , and the ratio of municipal to private undertakings has steadily increased . City ownership and operation work admirably in Great Britain where the city governments are carefully and wisely administered . In the United States , the universal policy is to charter corporations to perform the street-railway transportation // services . Had it also been our policy from the start to regulate these public-service corporations carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial methods , their charges and their services , the results would doubtless have been satisfactory . In most States , however , the practice has been to grant public-service corporations large powers and to provide for little effective control over their actions . In consequence of this mistaken practice , we have a serious street-railway problem , the solution of which is yet to be found in most of our States and municipalities . American System of Street Railway Regulation. ? A company desiring to build and operate a street railway in any city applies to the State for a charter , and having obtained the charter it secures a franchise from the city in which the street railway is to be constructed . It is customary for the State to impose relatively few charter restrictions upon // street-railway companies and to permit the local governments to exact such franchise conditions as they may think best . In granting the franchise , the city may stipulate what the maximum fares shall be , may require the companies to pay to the city a certain percentage of their gross or net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair the part of the street occupied by the railway tracks . Massachusetts has been more successful thus far than the other States have been in the regulation of street railways . The franchises are granted in perpetuity , but the franchise concessions may , with the approval of the state railroad commission , be revoked by city and town governments , if the companies fail to carry out their obligations to the public . The State railroad commission of Massachusetts is given large power over the street railways . Its // approval of the location of a proposed line must be secured before the railway can be constructed . The commission regulates the amount of stocks and bonds that may be issued , and its consent must be secured to the terms of a lease , sale , or consolidation of roads . It also has supervision over the fares and services of street railways and has power to make investigations and to recommend such additional State legislation as the commission may deem desirable . The State of New York is making amends for the past neglect of its duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission for Greater New York and another for the rest of the State were established and these two railway commissions were given much larger powers than their predecessor had . They have control over the location , capitalization , accounts , and services of public service corporations . It will take some time for public regulation to correct the mistakes that have been committed in the past in Greater New York and the other cities of the State , but the prospects for the future are at least encouraging . Under the influence of Massachusetts , New York and other progressive commonwealths , progress is being made with the solution of the problem of public regulation of street railways ; and it seems reasonable to expect that it will become customary in the not distant future for all States to require publicity of accounts of all public-service corporations , to subject their capitalization and financial operations to public regulation and to control their charges and services so as fully to safeguard the interests of the cities and the welfare of the public .  | The Increase in Interurban Lines. ? During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total mileage of electric railways , urban and interurban , increased 53.4 per cent , and while the spread of lines within the cities was continuous , the growth of extramural and interurban lines was at an even greater rate . The construction of interurban lines has been going on in most parts of the United States but their progress has been exceptionally rapid in New England , New York , in the Central West , and in southern California . In the small State of Massachusetts , there are 2,223 miles of electric lines and this exceeds the line mileage of steam railroads by 112 miles . The map of the electric lines of this State shows how completely they connect the principal cities in the eastern and central part of the State with the surrounding cities and adjacent country . For a number of years , it has been the policy of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad Company to absorb the electric lines with which it has competition , and also to build electric roads as feeders to its main line . The map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication of the extent to which the interurban roads have been developed in southern New England . The construction of electric lines has been pushed with vigor in Ohio , Indiana , southern Michigan , Wisconsin , and // in portions of Illinois . The accompanying map of this section of the United States shows that interurban electric roads in large number radiate from Milwaukee , Chicago , Indianapolis , Cincinnati , Dayton , Columbus , Detroit , Toledo , Cleveland , and from numerous other cities of smaller size . Several electric lines are operated over relatively long routes , there being a regular service of electric trains from Toledo to Dayton , from Toledo to Cleveland , and over several other lines . In some instances , sleeping cars are operated . Another important center of interurban electric roads is Los Angeles , Cal . From this city , as also from Indianapolis , lines proceed in several directions from a large electric terminal station . The Southern Pacific Railroad interests now control all the electric lines about Los Angeles . Character of Electric Roads Now Being Built. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one town to another . Such roads were cheaply built and they necessarily provided an unsatisfactory service , because high speed was impossible . Moreover , the steep grades of orc'inary highways made the expense of operation excessive and limited the development of traffic . The electric lines now being built have their own exclusive roadway and are constructed as well as the best steam railways . Many of the early electric roads which , like the first steam roads , started with as cheap construction as possible , have been rebuilt in accordance with the best standards . This has reduced the expenses of operation , and has enabled the electric lines to develop new traffic and to compete more successfully with steam railroads . Passenger Service of Interurban Lines. ? The electric railways have the great advantage of being able to provide a frequent passenger service ; the steam railroad train must Figure // necessarily consist of a heavy locomotive and two or more coaches , and it must handle its traffic in relatively large units . The electric road , on the contrary , can run cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as frequent and in such varying units as the traffic may demand . Moreover , the double-track interurban road with its own right of way can offer both local and express services . The interurban lines always coordinate closely with the streetrailway lines and thus enable their passengers to reach any part of the city conveniently with minimum delays . It is not surprising that the service of the interurban lines has proven popular , and that a large part of the local traffic formerly handled by steam railroads is now carried by the electric lines . Competition with Steam Roads. ? The most effective competition of electric lines with steam roads has been for the short-distance suburban and interurban traffic . The steam roads have lost so much of their short-distance traffic that the average length of the passenger trip upon the steam railroads has risen eighteen per cent during the past ten years . We are now witnessing the beginnings of long-distance and express services on the electric roads ; and this , of course , means keener competition between the electric and steam services . The progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam railroads must prepare to divide a larger part of the passenger traffic with their electric competitors . The Electric Lines as Feeders of the Steam Railroads. ? Electric roads outside of the city limits include both interurban and rural lines . It is impossible to draw a sharp distinction between these two classes of extramural lines ; but it will be recognized that some lines are built mainly to provide transportation between two or more cities , and that // other less expensive lines are constructed mainly to connect the smaller-sized towns with the surrounding villages and rural communities . These rural lines must be looked upon as feeders to the main lines with which they connect . For the most part , these main lines are the steam railroads , but to some extent they are interurban electric roads . Moreover , the interurban roads are often to be regarded as branches of steam railroads ? branches that have been constructed where a steam road would probably have otherwise been built . As the interurban lines reach out from the trunk-line steam roads , through one town after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural villages and communities , the general transportation system is made more complete and of greater economic and social advantage to the public . Fares on Interurban Roads. ? The charges of the electric lines average lower than those of the steam railroads . When the first interurban roads were built along the country highways , the fares were made especially low ; but with the construction of electric lines on private rights of way , and with the improvement of the service , it has been necessary for the electric roads somewhat to increase their fares . On the shorter interurban roads , a zone tariff prevails , five cents being charged and collected for each distance zone into which the line is divided . The long interurban roads , which approach the characteristics of steam railroads , sell tickets , and have a system of fares not unlike the passenger charges of the steam lines . Freight Services of Electric Lines. ? Although the electric lines have in all cases been constructed to handle passenger traffic , and although their main services consist of the transportation of persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first and most important of these freight services is the handling of parcels and the lighter grades of package freight into and out of the large cities . This service may be illustrated by reference to the Detroit United Railways which is now one of the many large electric railway companies that have well-organized freight services . This service , which dates from October , 1901 , is typical of that of other electric companies . The three electric systems controlled by the Detroit United Railways have a joint freight and express depot in Detroit . Freight stations are built along the company 's lines which extend to a point nearly one hundred miles from Detroit . The traffic handled includes milk , general express " matter , parcels from the markets and stores , and various kinds of package freight . To some extent the territory tapped by the Detroit United Railway lines has no other railway facilities , and this fact made it easy for the electric roads to build up a freight traffic . There is , however , successful competition with the steam railroads for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of freight service is performed by those electric roads that are feeders of the steam railroads . Usually these electric feeders extend from relatively large towns , located upon a steam railroad , through smaller towns having no railway connections . Several large steamrailroad systems are encouraging the construction of electric branch lines to serve as feeders both for their passenger and freight business . The third class of electric freight services is performed by the rural trolley lines , which gather up and take to market the farm products and perform a large part of the transportation business of the country villages . These rural lines are inexpensively built , mainly along the high-Figure // ways ; and with the development which they are certain to have in the near future , the steam- and electric-railway transportation system will be brought into immediate connection with an increasing number of rural communities and with the people of a greater number of small towns . Economic and Social Advantages Resulting from Electric Railways. ? The desire to travel is universal ; and the rapid increase of suburban and interurban railways has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheaply than they formerly could . There has been an enormous development of travel for pleasure and for education , but the chief effects of the electric railways have been industrial . Most travel is undertaken for business reasons , and the chief function of the electric road has been to enable the people to do their work more easily . Moreover , with the spread of electric lines generally through the country , production and trade will be carried on more economically , and the general well-being of the masses of the people will thereby be improved .  | The General Problem. ? Electric railways have met with great success in short-distance passenger traffic , and they are beginning to be used to some extent for the transportation of passengers over routes 100 to 200 miles in length ; indeed , it may be said that an electric railway 100 miles in length is nothing unusual at the present time . A beginning has also been made in performing a light freight service , and there are a few instances of the handling of heavy freight upon electric roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be asked whether electric power will , in the near future , largely or entirely take the place of the steam locomotive . If both steam and electric power are to be employed , what are the special services that will be taken over by the electric lines ? The General Electrification of all Steam Railways is not Probable. ? Careful studies have been made by engineers and transportation experts to determine whether it would be economical for the steam railroads as a whole , or for the more important railway systems , to equip their lines electrically and to abandon the use of steam locomotives . The results of these calculations do not indicate the early , general abandonment of steam power . A change to electricity necessitates a heavy investment of capital which can be justified only under special traffic conditions . Electric power is well adapted to two very different // classes of services : one is the existence of a passenger or freight traffic heavy enough to require a frequent service . The heavier the traffic the more economical does electric power become . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and but a moderate volume of passenger business which can be handled in small units at relatively frequent intervals , can also use electricity to advantage . It needs no argument to show that these two traffic conditions prevail only to a limited extent upon American railways , and that consequently the conditions do not warrant the early abandonment of the steam locomotive . The Electrification of Steam Railroads will be in Particular Sections and it will be done for special purposes : 1 . The first service for which the electric locomotive was used in place of the steam engine was to haul engines through tunnels and subways . Reference has already been made to the adoption of the electric locomotive , by the City and South London Railway , in 1890 , to handle traffic through the Thames tunnel . In 1895 , the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad began hauling freight trains through its new tunnels in the city of Baltimore with heavy electric locomotives . Electric locomotives will be used in the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels into and under New York City . These are but the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . One of the largest substitutions of electricity for steam is in the electrification of the big city terminals of the railroads . The equipment of the New York terminals of the New York Central and the New York , New Haven &; Hartford railroads , the electrification of the lines of the Long Island Railroad in the western part of Long Island , and the use of electric locomotives in the Pennsyl-Figure // vania Railroad tunnels promise to eliminate the steam locomotive not only from the- central part of New York , but also from the railway lines for some distance out of that city . The electrification of the Chicago terminal of the Illinois Central Railroad has been decided upon , and this is doubtless the first step in the general electrification of all railroads in the city of Chicago . Other cities in the not distant future will doubtless follow the example of New York and Chicago , and we may confidently expect the elimination of the steam locomotive from our cities . 3 . Another service for which the electric locomotive is specially adapted is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain grades . The efficiency of electric locomotives for exceptionally heavy work is greater than that of the steam locomotive . There are several reasons why this is so : ( a ) One cause is that the electric locomotive can exert its maximum force for an indefinite time ; whereas a steam locomotive has such difficulty in keeping up the pressure of steam in the boiler that it can handle its maximum load only for a short period of time . ( b ) Another advantage resulting from the use of electricity in the mountainous sections of railroads is that the length of summit tunnels can be made longer than they might wisely be if steam locomotives were to be used in hauling trains through them . By making the tunnels longer the railroad line can be kept at a lower elevation and the grades can be correspondingly reduced . ( c ) Moreover , the economy of electricity is much greater when it can be generated by water power , and in mountain sections water power is generally obtainable . The electrification of the mountain sections of our railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the railroads which have heavy mounELECTRIFICATION // tain grades to overcome . The Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul is considering using electric equipment over the Bitter Root Mountains and through the tunnel in that section of its line . The Northern Pacific has announced its intention to install electricity upon its heavy mountain grades ; and other railroad companies having lines across the Rocky Mountains are making investigations with the view to electrifying certain sections of their roads . 4 . Beginnings have been made with the electrification of sections of trunk-line railroads for the purpose of handling electrically the local passenger traffic over those portions of the road . Instances of this are the electrification of the Rochester branch of the Erie Railroad , and of the main line of the West Shore Railroad between Utica and Syracuse , N. Y. Over these sections thus electrified , through traffic , freight and passenger , is handled by steam locomotives , while the local passenger services are performed by electric cars . By handling local passenger traffic in this way a more frequent service can be given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is also important , these sections of the Erie and the West Shore railroads can closely coordinate their local passenger traffic with that of the connecting urban and interurban electric lines . The Adoption of Electricity instead of Steam on New Railways. ? Many railways are being built with electrical equipment that would have used steam locomotives had they been constructed a decade ago . Indeed , the rapid growth of new interurban lines is doing more to bring about a substitution of electricity for steam than is the electrification of existing trunk-line railways . This movement will continue , and in the future we may expect to see the transportation services divided between steam and elec194 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION tric roads , each performing the work for which it is best fitted . The change from steam to electricity promises to be gradual . There is little prospect that the heavy freight traffic will be moved electrically , except through tunnels , over mountains , or into and out of large city terminals . The change , in the near future , will be confined mainly to an increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines whose traffic will consist largely of handling passengers will almost surely be electrically equipped . A partial , but not a general , electrification of main line steam railroads may be expected , first to handle the local passenger traffic ; later , possibly , for the through freight and passenger business . PART III OCEAN TRANSPORTATION CHAPTER XXIII TONS AND TONNAGE . HOW VESSELS AND TRAF ARE MEASURED Uses of the Words Ton and Tonnage. ? In describir various types of vessels , and in discussing ocean portation , frequent use must be made of the words " and " tonnage , " and , in order to avoid confusion error , it is necessary to keep clearly in mind the si meanings in which these terms are employed . To : may refer either to the size of the vessel or to the al of the ship 's cargo ; accordingly , there are two di kinds of tons : the vessel ton and the cargo ton . EE . these two kinds of tons is used with several different ings . Vessel Tonnage is of Three Kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displacement tonnag vessel is its weight , and is equal to the weight ofwate placed by the ship when floating . The gross registe nage is obtained by dividing the number of cubic f the capacity of the ship by 100 . A vessel has one " g ton for each 100 cubic feet of capacity . The net re tonnage is obtained by dividing by 100 the eapae : cubic feet of the space available for cargo and passe From the entire capacity of the ship are deducte spaces occupied by machinery , crew accommodation , certain other housings , carefully designated by law 197 // then the number of cubic feet in the remaining capacity is divided by 100 to obtain the net register . In the shipping statistics of all countries a ton gross register means 100 cubic feet of ship capacity ; but as the rules applied in measuring the capacity are not identical in all countries , vessels of the same size under different flags may vary slightly as to gross tonnage . In the determination of the figures for net registry the laws of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registry ; nevertheless , with the exception of the " Danube " measurement , which is applied to all vessels passing the Suez Canal , the British practice as regards the measurement of gross and net tonnage is followed with minor variations by all commercial countries . The rules of the Danube measurement were adopted at Constantinople in 1873 for the Suez Canal by the International Tonnage Commission . The net register tonnage of vessels when measured by the Danube rules will average fully one fifth more than when measured in accordance with British or American laws . The canal tolls are levied on net tonnage . The Cargo Ton is of Two Classes , Weight and Measurement. ? The weight ton is of three kinds . It may be the " short " ton of 2,000 pounds , the " long " ton of 2,240 pounds , or the metric ton of 2,204.62 pounds . The traffic of American railroads and waterways ( with the exception of anthracite coal , which is handled by the long ton in the Eastern States ? not in the Western ) is measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally used within the United States . In ocean commerce the weight ton is the long ton of 2,240 pounds , except in the trade of those countries that use the metric system and employ the metric ton of 2,204.62 pounds . // A large share of the cargo of ocean traffic is not shipped by weight , but by the measurement ton of 40 cubic feet . Grain and minerals move by weight ; but manufactures , general merchandise , and even lumber , are regularly handled by the measurement ton . The adoption of 40 cubic feet for a measurement ton is said to be due to the fact that a long ton of wheat occupies 40 cubic feet in the hold or berth of the ship . In the Government statistics of the cargo tonnage of ocean commerce , both the long ton and the measurement ton are included , and it is not possible to ascertain from published statistics the actual weight of the traffic of ocean commerce . Indeed , this can be determined only by an investigation of the relation of the value of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gross register tonnage and cargo tonnage of a modern vessel loaded with general cargo is as 1 to 11 and to 21 . The net register is about two thirds the gross , and the cargo tonnage averages about 21 times the net register . For example , a cargo steamer of 6,000 tons gross register will measure 4,000 tons net register , and she will carry about 9,000 tons of cargo . In the large modern sailing vessel the net register is about seven eighths of the gross , and the cargo tonnage of the loaded vessel will average about 1i times the net register . The ratio of net register , gross register , and cargo tonnage being 7 to 8 to about 12 for the sailing vessel . Thus a sailing vessel of 2,100 tons net register will measure 2,400 tons gross , and have a cargo capacity of about 3,500 tons . American Shipping includes Both Documented and Undocumented Craft. ? Barges , lighters , floats , and other craft that are towed are not documented ; but sailing vessels and steamers of all description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Government . // Before a vessel can be put into service its machinery must be inspected by the United States Steamboat Inspection Service , and the ship must be measured by officials connected with the Bureau of Navigation in the Department of Commerce and Labor . The vessels engaged in foreign commerce are " registered , " and those employed in our inland and coastwise commerce are " enrolled . " All vessels of less than 20 tons measurement are " licensed . " It is customary to use the term " registered " tonnage when speaking of our shipping engaged in foreign trade , and of " enrolled " tonnage when referring to our domestic fleet . The documented vessels comprise somewhat over half the total tonnage of American shipping of all kinds . In all the statistics of shipping , only the tonnage of documented vessels is included . This misleads nearly every person , it being generally supposed that the figures comprise all kinds of craft . The tonnage of the merchant marine of the United States , for example , is ordinarily said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was the tonnage of only our registered , enrolled , and licensed vessels ? the documented tonnage . In addition to that , there were between 6,000,000 and 7,000,000 tons of undocumented craft ? consisting mainly of barges , lighters , floats , and other craft not moved by their own power . The total merchant marine of the United States at the close of 1909 has an aggregate gross tonnage of nearly 14,000,000.  | The Three Classes of Ocean Craft are sailing vessels , steamers , and barges . In each class there are many different kinds , and this is especially true of steamers which include all types from the mammoth ocean liner down to harbor tugs and small yachts . Both sailing vessels and steamers have required many improvements to reach their present size and efficiency . Mechanical genius has , from the beginning of ship building to the present , sought constantly to adapt the ship more perfectly to its work of transporting passengers and freight . The larger size , and the greater speed and reliability of ocean vessels have made possible the present-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , equally true that the development of trade has given shipbuilders and shipowners their main incentive to construct and operate larger and better vessels . Types of Sailing Vessels. ? The names given to different kinds of sailing vessels are determined by the number of masts and the rig of the sails . The " square-rigged " vessel has sails attached to yards or beams so suspended from the mast as to cross the mast and extend equal distances on each side . The " schooner-rigged " vessel has sails with yardarms that do not cross the mast , but extend outward from one side of the mast . A " ship " is a full-rigged sailing vessel having three or // more masts with the sails all square-rigged . A three-masted vessel with its two forward masts ? the fore- and mainmasts ? square-rigged and its after or mizzenmast fore-and-aft rigged , is a bark . When the foremast only is square rigged , and the main- and mizzenmast are rigged fore and aft , the vessel is a barkentine . A brig has two masts , both square-rigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sloop and the schooner have fore-and-aft rig , the sloop being a vessel of but one mast , the schooner with two or more . The construction of the first schooner is credited to Captain Andrew Robinson , of Gloucester , Mass. , who is said to have launched a two-masted schooner in 1713 or 1714 . Because it took place at Gloucester , the vessel has often been called the Gloucester schooner . The schooner was given sharper lines than the old square-rigged vessels had , and could sail faster and closer to the wind . Its sails could be managed more easily than the square sails could , and a smaller crew of men was required . The // schooner was especially useful in the Atlantic coasting trade where it was necessary for vessels to sail close to the wind in beating up and down the coast . Growth in Size of Sailing Vessels. ? The far-reaching and relatively large ocean commerce of the American colonies was carried on in ships which to-day would seem tiny . Near the end of the eighteenth century , the standard size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register . The coasting trade and much of the oversea traffic was handled in brigs , schooners , and sloops having a register of 50 to 100 tons . During the nineteenth century , and particularly after the War of 1812-15 , the size of sailing vessels rapidly increased . At the opening of the century , 300 tons register was considered large even for a fullrigged ship . Before 1820 , vessels of 400 to 500 tons gross register were in use , and before 1840 double-decked ships of 1,000 tons had appeared . The first three-deck sailing ship , the Guy Mannering , was built in 1849 . It had a gross register tonnage of 1,419 . Others equally large were soon in service , the demand for large sailing vessels being especially urgent in the United States from 1850 to 1860 . Until after the Civil War the largest sailing vessels were square-rigged ships , but since 1885 practically all new vessels have been schooner-rigged . The largest sailing vessel built in America was the Thomas W. Lawson , launched 1899 ; it had seven masts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,000 to 8,000 tons of cargo . This vessel was never especially successful and its career was ended in 1907 , when it capsized off the English coast . Several sailing vessels under the German flag are nearly as large as the Lawson was , and they have been operated with profit to their owners . The Packet Lines. ? After the close of the War of 1812 ? // 1815 , the commerce of the United States with Europe had become regular enough to warrant the operation of vessels as lines with regular schedules of sailing . The Black Ball Line was the first of the packet lines ; it started running in 1815 . The term packet was applied to the line ships because they carried the mails , i. e. , the packages of mail . The American packet lines rapidly multiplied , they were operated with great success , and gave the United States " an envious place in the ocean-carrying trade during the first half of the nineteenth century . The Clipper Ship. ? The fastest and most celebrated ship was the clipper ship , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore in 1845 . The ship derived its name from its sharp lines and its long overhanging prow . It was not so economical a freight carrier as the ordinary square-rigged packet ship was , because it had // to sacrifice cargo capacity to secure the sharp lines necessary to secure maximum speed . Two causes brought about the construction of the clipper ship : one was the introduction of the steamer in 1840 in the transatlantic carrying trade . The British steamship lines immediately threatened to take the passenger and express business away from the American sailing vessels , hence American builders sought to perfect the sailing vessel to enable it to compete more successfully with the steamer . A demand for fast sailing vessels also arose in 1849-50 , when there was a great rush from the eastern part of the United States to the California gold fields . The Golden Age of the Sailing Vessel. ? The greatest period of prosperity in the business of building and operating American sailing vessels came in the decade from 1850 to 1860 . At that time he American oversea commerce was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large passenger and freight traffic between our eastern and western seaports created an active demand for sailing vessels ; and when , in 1854 , the California gold fever began to abate , the Crimean War broke out , and both France and the United Kingdom purchased a large number of American sailing vessels for use as transports . In 1855 there were 583,450 gross tons of vessels launched in American yards ? a greater tonnage than was constructed during any other year of the nineteenth century . Decline in the Tonnage of Sailing Vessels. ? The tonnage of sailing vessels under the American flag reached the highest point in 1861 , upon the opening of the Civil War , when it amounted to 4,662,609 . After that year there was an almost uninterrupted decline . In twenty-five years the figures had fallen to 2,608,152 , and the total to-day is practically the same as it was in 1885 and 1886 . Our steam ton206 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION nage , on the other hand , has increased more rapidly than the sailing vessels have fallen off . In 1861 our documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time we have nearly 5,000,000 tons of documented steamships , and they comprise about sixty-five per cent of our registered , enrolled , and licensed shipping . The steamship has taken the place of the sailing vessel , because it is more efficient and economical . Domestic and international commerce is now so organized as to cause traders to put a higher value than they formerly did upon promptness and certainty of delivery of commodities ; moreover , the marine engine has been so improved as to reduce the fuel cost to such a low point as to deprive the sailing vessel of most of the advantage it formerly had from the fact that the wind which supplied the motor power cost nothing . A modern freight steamer requires only one tenth of a ton of coal , costing thirty or thirty-five cents , to transport a ton of cargo 5,000 miles . The Future of the Sailing Vessel. ? It is not to be inferred that the sailing vessel is to cease to be used in American coastwise and oversea commerce . Schooners can be put into service for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time to be useful in transporting relatively small cargoes of commodities that are shipped in bulk . The schooner is especially serviceable in the coastwise lumber trade , and can also be employed to advantage in international trade with those sections where commercial exchanges are small or variable in volume . The sailing vessel will not disappear , but its role is to be one of decreasing importance .  | Invention and Introduction of the Ocean Steamship. ? Although Robert Fulton was not the first man to propel boats by steam power , the success of the Clermont , which he fitted with engines and ran from New York to Albany in 1807 , entitled him to the credit of having demonstrated the commercial practicability of the steamship . The use of the steamboats upon the rivers and bays became general within a few years after 1807 ; it was , however , about thirty years before it was possible to drive a vessel across the ocean by steam power . The first vessel to cross the ocean without using sails was the Royal William , which made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wight to London in 1833 . Five years later the Great Western and three other steamers made such successful runs between England and New York as to cause their owners to establish regular transatlantic steam services . The present great Cunard Company was the third British transatlantic company . Its first steamers , ordered in 1839 , were put in operation in 1840 , from which year we may say that the permanent transatlantic steamship service dates . Comparison of Earliest and Latest Steamers. ? The progress that has been made in ocean transportation is strikingly shown by comparing the steamers which the Cunard Company put into service in 1840 with their latest creations , // the Mauretania and Lusitania , which began running in 1908 . The Cunarders of 1840 were of 1,140 tons gross register ; they were a little over 200 feet long , and of 35 feet beam . Their speed was from eight to ten knots per hour ; and , under exceptionally favorable conditions , they made the passage in two weeks ? often three weeks were required , especially for the trip westward against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mauretania and Lusitania have a gross register tonnage of 32,500 , 28 times that of their early ancestors ; their length is 790 feet , and they are 88 feet in breadth . They have a speed of over 25 knots an hour . Their engines , which are turbines , develop 68,000 horse power , 92 times the power of the first Cunarder . The Three General Problems of Steamship Improvement. ? To develop the ocean steamship of to-day out of the first crude steamships required the solution of three general mechanical problems : ( a ) The efficient application of power , first by means of paddle wheels , later by means of screw propellers ; ( ' ) ) the mechanical generation of power // in the marine engine ; and ( c ) the design and construction of the ship so as to give it larger size and greater buoyancy and to increase its speed . It will be well to refer briefly to each of these general mechanical problems . " From Paddle Wheels to Propellers. ? The first steamships were constructed of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not until after 1850 that the screw propeller came to be generally adopted in place of the side wheels . The credit for the invention of the screw propeller belongs equally to John Ericsson ( who later achieved great fame as // the architect of the first Monitor ) and Francis P. Smith , an English farmer . These men , each working in his own way , propelled a ship successfully with screws in 1836 . Smith 's ship , the Archimedes , built in 1839 , was so successful as to convince builders of the practicability of the use of the screw for the ocean service . The screw did not quickly displace the paddle wheel , because it was some years before the efficiency of the screw was as great as that of the side wheels . There were two reasons for this : The early screws were not so well designed as those now in use , and the early marine engines had a slow piston stroke that was more effective in driving large paddle wheels than in driving small screws . By 1850 , these difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt the screw for its fast ships ; other British companies soon took similar action . UnforTHE // tunately , American builders continued to construct sidewheel steamers for some time after 1850 . Up to 1880 the ocean vessels were too small to have more than one set of engines and thus to have more than one propeller ; but after 1880 the use of twin screws became increasingly common , first experimentally , but soon with all ocean liners . Double screws were used on war vessels before they were on merchantmen . The Development of the Marine Engine. ? The marine engines now in use are of two general types : the reciprocating and the turbine . The reciprocating , which is still the more usual form of engine , is one which drives a piston back and forth ; whereas the turbine engine drives or revolves a drum or shaft in one direction . The reciprocating // engine has had an interesting technical evolution . Only a few of its main types will be referred to here . The first Cunarders and the other early ocean steamships had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking-beam engines , still seen on ferry boats , except that the beam was not placed above the cylinder and wheel shaft , but below and at the side , as is shown in the illustration . When the screw propellers came into use , it was necessary to increase the speed of the revolution of the shaft , and to accomplish this the geared engine was introduced , i. e. , an engine which drove a large cog wheel that geared into a smaller wheel that revolved the propeller shaft . The general arrangement of the geared-beam engine is shown in the illustration . Another geared engine frequently used was the one with oscillating cylinders . The piston in this engine was connected directly with the crank shaft and as the crank revolved the entire cylinder oscillated upon its central axis of support . The // general design of such an engine is indicated by the illustration . The gearing of the engine caused loss of power ; and from the time the screw propeller was introduced , efforts were made to perfect a direct-acting engine . It was difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wide enough to permit the engine to be placed at a right angle to the shaft between the propeller shaft and the side of the vessel . In course of time this problem was solved by placing the cylinders of the engine in an inverted position directly above the propeller shaft . Thus , about 1870 , originated the inverted direct-acting marine engine . The early engines , as will be explained presently , had a very low pressure of steam in the boilers ; but , after 1870 , boilers were built that could stand a pressure of sixty pounds or more to the square inch . It was then possible to introduce the compound engine in which the steam was used successively in two cylinders . In 1881 a triple-expansion engine was put into service ; and , in 1894 , the first quadruple-expansion engine made its appearance . Since // then practically all marine engines installed have been quadruple-expansion inverted direct-acting engines . The arrangement of one of these is shown in the illustration . The Turbine Engine , now used upon some ocean steamships , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who applied to the steam engine the principle that had long been used in constructing water wheels . The following brief description of Parsons 's turbine is given in the volume published by the United States Census of 1902 ( vol. x , Part 4 , page 397 ) : // " The Parsons 's type of turbine has a series of disks mounted upon a common shaft , and alternating with parallel blades fixed within the casing of the shaft . There are buckets or cups , upon both the revolving disks and the fixed blades , the fixed buckets being reversed in relation to the moving cups . The steam , admitted first through a set of stationary blades or buckets , impinges at an angle upon the first rotating disk and imparts motion , passing thence through another set of fixed blades to the second disk upon the main shaft , and thus through the entire series of alternately fixed and rotating buckets . The area of the passages increases progressively to correspond with // the expansion of the steam as it is used on the successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that the propeller shaft is encircled by a series of closely placed rims on the edge of each of which are small disks or blades , against which the steam expands under high pressure , thus causing the shaft to revolve . The pressure of steam in passing the length of the engine , and from one row of disks to the next , is maintained by the cylindrical casing or stator that surrounds the revolving shaft . The inner surface of the stator is covered with a series of rows of disks , which are so placed as to face the disks on the interior revolving shaft . The Boiler and the Furnace. ? The engine applies the // power , the boiler generates it ; and it is the boiler that determines the efficiency of the engine . The first boilers were flat-sided and box-shaped , and the pressure of the steam within them was as low as 10 or 12 pounds per square inch . It was not possible to raise the pressure above 40 or 50 pounds to the square inch until after 1868 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this had been done , the improvement of the boiler was merely a matter of detail . The most important step made since 1868 has been the adoption of corrugated cylindrical furnaces . The marine boiler now almost universally used is one with internal corrugated furnaces , and with return horizontal tubes . In these boilers the fire passes from the furnace through the tubes , and thus up the stack . This is the fire-tube boiler . Some use is made of water-tube boilers . In these hoders the water is in the tubes and the fire posses around // the tubes instead of through them . Such boilers have greater heating efficiency , but the tubes must be constructed of copper which is more expensive than steel . These boilers also cost more to maintain . Their use for this reason has been confined mainly to naval vessels , where expense is a secondary consideration . The experience of the navy with water-tube boilers has not been very satisfactory , and their future use is not probable . From Wooden to Iron and Steel Hulls. ? The use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1840 , and it was not until about 1.850 that iron came to be used on a large scale in vessel construction . In Great Britain comparatively few wooden vessels were built after 1850 ; in the United States , on the contrary , where wood was cheap and iron expensive , shipbuilders continued to use wood until 1870 ; and even at the present time a relatively large percentage of our marine consists of ships of wooden construction . The second change in material came about 1880 , when British builders began to use steel instead of iron . After a few years steel was more largely used than iron , and at the present time it has practically displaced iron in the shipyards of all countries . The iron hull had greater buoyancy , strength , and durability than wooden hulls had ; and , similarly , steel is superior to iron in all these three particulars . Future Possibilities. ? The ocean steamship has been improved with such marvelous rapidity during recent years that it is interesting to conjecture what the future possibilities may be . Engineers seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nearly attained , and it would seem that the ability to maintain a speed of , nearly 26 knots an hour ( over 30 statute miles ) for the entire distance // across the Atlantic , leaves little more to be desired as regards rate of ocean travel . The ocean vessel , although now of huge proportions , unquestionably will be still larger in the future . Indeed , it is probable that ships of 1,000 feet in length will be launched within a few years . As regards the marine engine , the next advance will probably be in the improvement and more general use of the turbine , either instead of , or , what is more likely , in connection with the reciprocating engines . The use of both seems to give better results than the use of either one solely . There are some prophets who are bold enough to predict that the much more efficient internal combustion engine , such as is used in automobiles and in gas engines and upon small vessels , will ultimately be applicable to the heaviest work , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will mean a revolution in the ocean steamship service .  | Factors Controlling Routes of Steamers and Sailing Vessels. ? The routes taken by vessels in steaming or sailing from one seaport to another are influenced by numerous factors . The shortest route between any two places upon the surface of the earth is the arc of a great circle passing through those two points and the center of the earth . By taking a piece of paper or a flexible metal ruler , and bending it over the surface of a globe so that one edge of the piece of paper , or of the flexible ruler , touches two points , like San Francisco and Yokohama , it will be seen that the edge of the paper or ruler marks a course which passes far to the north of the east and west parallel of latitude joining the two cities . It will also be observed that the edge of the paper or ruler is much shorter than the length of the parallel of latitude connecting San Francisco with Yokohama , and that the short route between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except when diverted therefrom to seek traffic or to avoid obstacles , steamers endeavor to follow the great circle route between two ports . Sailing vessels , however , are obliged to shape their course with reference to the location and direction of ocean currents and prevailing winds . Sailing routes are usually longer than those which steamers can follow . This is well illustrated by the course sailing vessels take // in making the passage from New York to Australia . Starting out from New York in the region of prevailing westerly winds , the vessel 's course is nearly east for about 2,000 miles until it is two thirds of the way across the Atlantic , when it swings south into the belt of northern trades which blow from the northeast . The vessel keeps on a course to the south , passes the equator and crosses the belt of southern trade winds which blow from the southeast , and does not swing to the east across the South Atlantic until it reaches a latitude as far south as the Cape of Good Hope , where catching the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlantic and sails on past Africa to Australia . The steamer , on the other hand , proceeds by // a direct great circle route from New York to the Cape Verde Islands and thence to Capetown and on to Australia . By studying a globe upon which the direction of the prevailing winds in different latitudes is shown , the student will be able to understand why there is such difference between sailing and steam routes upon the ocean . The Seven Most Traveled Ocean Routes. ? While there are innumerable courses taken by vessels in sailing the " trackless sea , " the ocean highways crossing and recrossing each other at many points , there are seven main traveled ocean routes : 1 . The first and most important of these is the line across the North Atlantic . At the eastern end of this route is the English Channel , from which vessels proceed to the main ports of Europe . At the western end are New York and the other North Atlantic seaboard cities of the United States . More than half of the entire shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Atlantic route . 2 . Next in importance comes the route connecting the great seaports of both sides of the North Atlantic with India , the East Indies and the Orient via the Mediterranean Sea , the Suez Canal and the Red Sea . The use of this great ocean highway was made possible by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 , and as sailing vessels can not navigate the canal and the Red Sea , this route is used exclusively by steamers . 3 . The next important route is the one around South Africa connecting both European and American ports on the North Atlantic with South America and with Australia and New Zealand . All freight steamers from Europe and the United States to Australia pass around the Cape of Good hope instead of going through the Suez Canal when // on the way to Australia . Ships from European ports might save about 1,000 miles by using the canal route , but the tolls charged for passing through the canal are so high as to make it cheaper for the freight vessels to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the Suez route . 4 . Corresponding with the South African-Australian route , just described , is the one around South America , connecting the Atlantic ports of America and Europe with the west coast of the three Americas . This route is used much more by the ships from Europe than by those from the United States . the larger part of the traffic between // the two seaboards of the United States being handled by the Isthmuses of Panama and Tehuantepec. 5 . In.the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea , which are sometimes called the " American Mediterranean , " are numerous routes connecting the adjacent cities . These routes within the Gulf and Caribbean connect , through the Straits of Florida and Windward Passage , with the highways to and from our Atlantic seaboard , and , by way of these Straits and the Mona Passage , with the ocean route to and from Europe . 6 . Of the two lines across the Pacific the one most traveled is the great circle route across the North Pacific connecting San Francisco , Portland and Puget Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila . This route from San Francisco to Yokohama is nearly 1,000 miles shorter than the course via the Hawaiian Islands . 7 . The other ocean highway of major importance is the one connecting the Pacific coast of North America with New Zealand and Australia . Ordinarily vessels on this route call at Hawaii and New Zealand ports . In some cases , however , the course is by way of Tahiti in the Society Islands instead of via Honolulu . Every student of ocean routes should not only locate the foregoing seven highways upon a map or globe , but should also work out and locate upon a map the probable routes which steamers and sailing vessels would take from the leading ports of the United States to different parts of the world . Ocean Ship Canals. ? To shorten ocean routes , three important ocean ship canals ? the Suez , the Kaiser Wilhelm and the Corinth ? have been constructed , and a fourth one of still greater consequence will be opened at Panama within a few years . The Suez Canal was constructed between // 1859 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lesseps . The distance from Port Said , on the Mediterranean , to Suez on the Red Sea is eighty-eight nautical , or one hundred statute , miles ; twenty-seven miles of this distance is taken up by four lakes created by the canal which filled up depressions or basins between the two seas . The Suez Canal has a depth of thirty-one feet at low water , but will soon be deepened to thirty-six feet . In 1875 , the British Government purchased all the shares of canal stock // owned by the Khedive of Egypt and thus secured a large measure of control over this waterway . This was done in order to safeguard the commercial and political interests of Great Britain in Egypt and in India . The vast commerce between Europe and India and the Orient passes through the Suez Canal . In 1907 the net tonnage of vessels , commercial and naval , that used the Suez Canal was 14 , - 728,434 . The revenues from tolls are lare , and the canal stock yields its owners fifteen per cent per annum . The Baltic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser Wilhelm Canal , extending from Kiel Bay to Brunsbiittel at the mouth of the Elbe River . This waterway is located on German soil and was constructed by the German Government for naval and commercial reasons . It shortens the route between the two separated German seaboards by from 300 to 400 miles . The canal has a length of 61 miles ; and its present dimensions are 291 feet depth , 72 feet bottom width , and 190 feet surface breadth . The growth of the traffic of the waterway , which now annually passes vessels with a gross tonnage of about 6,000,000 tons , makes the early enlargement of the canal a necessity . The Corinth Canal is a short waterway . f our miles in length connecting the Gulf of Corinth with the Gulf of IEgina . This waterway proved very difficult and expensive to construct and cost $13,750,000 . Since it was opened in 1893 its traffic has grown slowly and the receipts from tolls have not been sufficient to meet operating expenses and interest charges . The light traffic is due in part to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 69 feet and the depth 26 feet 4 inch . The air and tidal currents through the canal have made navigation somewhat difficult particularly through the part of the canal where there is a deep rock cut , consequently most vessels // plying between the ports of the Black and Aegean seas and those of the Adriatic and the Western Mediterranean prefer to keep to the longer open sea route around Morea . Some years ago the city of Amsterdam found that the Zuider Zee had become too shallow to accommodate ocean vessels , and the city was threatened with the loss of its ocean commerce . The situation was met by the construe- tion of a canal from Ymuiden on the North Sea , a distance of 152 miles . This waterway is 32 feet deep and 165 feet wide at the bottom . The net tonnage of the vessels passing the tidal lock at Ymuiden is about 5,000,000 . This waterway has assured Amsterdam continued growth and prosperity . Manchester , the greatest textile manufacturing center of the world , was made a seaport in 1894 by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This waterway is 35imiles long and has four locks , by means of which vessels are elevated 60 feet above the sea . The canal is 28 feet deep , and has a bottom width of 120 feet . At Manchester , extensive dock areas have been excavated and what was formerly an inland city has become a seaport , visited annually by 5,000 to 6,000 seagoing vessels aggregating between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 tons gross register . The traffic carried by these ships is approaching 5,000,000 cargo tons annually . The Seaport , its Parts and Types. ? The seaboard terminal of the ocean route consists of three distinct parts : the channel to and from the sea , the harbor proper , and the piers , docks , warehouses and other facilities for receiving and forwarding traffic . All three of these parts are more or less artificial , there being few large seaports whose channels and harbors have not required more or less dredging to make them deep and wide enough to accommodate modern shipping . Some of the largest seaports in the world ? Hamburg , Bremen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seaports are of four types . Some cities like Boulogne , France , and others are situated directly on the shore of the sea , and have no natural harbor or channel of approach ; ships must ride at anchor in the open roadstead . Such ports are of the roadstead type . The second type of port is that located on a bay , as are San Francisco and Pensacola . The river ports , such as Philadelphia and New Orleans , represent a third class ; while some ports like that of New York and Mobile are located both at the head of a bay and at the mouth of a navigable river . Ports of this fourth class are the most favorably situated of all . The most rapidly growing seaports of the world are those which // are situated at or near the mouth of a large navigable river . Hamburg on the river Elbe has made the most phenomenal progress of any port in the world . The advances of Rotterdam , near the mouth of the Rhine , and of New York , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , have been hardly less rapid . Ports are Public , Semipublic , and Private. ? Some ports , as , for instance , Hamburg , Rotterdam , and Antwerp , are constructed and managed by the city government , aided more or less by the State . Other ports , like Liverpool and London , have been improved and are administered by public " trusts , " which are corporations controlled jointly by the public and by the commercial interests of the port . The third class of ports , of which there is a large and increasing number , is typified by Southampton , England , which was constructed and is now controlled by a railroad company . It is thus seen that the great ports of the world may be divided into three classes according to the authority which controls them ? public , semipublic , and private . // American System of Port Improvement and Control. ? In the United States the improvement and administration of the seaports are shared jointly by the Federal , State and Local Governments . The United States dredges , buoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishes pierhead lines , i. e. , the lines to which piers may extend from the shore into the channel . From the pier-head line to the shore the State Government has authority . It may exercise this authority directly , as is done in California and a few other States , or it may authorize the city government to regulate and develop the terminal facilities as has been done at New York City and Philadelphia . Whether the port is controlled by State authority or the city government , the piers and other transfer facilities and the ground along the harbor front may be reserved as public property , or may be sold to individuals or corporations . Until recent // years , the practice of most American cities has been to permit the private ownership of harbor frontage ; the time however , has now come when the commercial necessities of our largest seaports make it desirable for the public to secure possession of the harbor facilities and develop them systematically with reference to the commerce and industry of the port as a whole . The tendency in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public port .  | Choice of the Canal Route. ? The interest of the American people in a canal to be constructed either through Central America or across the Isthmus of Panama dates from the beginning of gold mining in California in 1848 ? 50 , and the exodus at that time of large numbers of people to the Pacific coast . Lines of vessels were put into service from New York and other Atlantic ports to the Caribbean shore of the Isthmus of Panama and also between the bay of Panama and California , passengers and freight being transferred across the Isthmus by small boats up the Chagres River and by pack trains over the divide separating the Chagres Valley from the bay of Panama . This route was soon improved by the construction of a railroad , which was opened in 1855 . Another Isthmian route much used was across Nicaragua via the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua , from which there was a portage of thirteen miles to San Juan del Sur on the Pacific Ocean . This route was developed by Commodore Vanderbilt who ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and between San Juan del Sur and California ports and transferred passengers across Nicaragua by steamboats and stages . In 1850 and for some years thereafter , it was supposed that the best route for a canal across the Isthmus was one via the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua , because it Figure // was thought that the San Juan River could be made navigable for ocean ships . This route , however , is 184 miles in length ; whereas the distance from ocean to ocean at the Isthmus of Panama is but 41 miles . As time went on , the San Juan River silted up badly and ocean vessels were built with much greater draft . Thus it was that when a French company decided , about 1880 , to build a canal they chose the route across Panama . At that time , it was supposed that a sea-level canal would be constructed . This was possible at Panama , whereas a Nicaragua canal must have locks . The French company failed in its effort to build the Panama Canal ; and the same was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1885 to 1893 , to put a canal across Nicaragua . The Panama and Nicaragua canal companies having failed , the United States Government began to consider the construction of an isthmian waterway ; and was at first disposed to select the Nicaragua route ; not only because a French company had control of the Panama route ; but also because it was supposed that a Nicaragua canal would better serve American commerce . From 1895 to 1899 , three commissions , one after another , were appointed by the United States Government to investigate the canal route , and the final decision was in favor of securing possession of the Panama project and carrying that to completion . This decision was reached by the United States Government in 1902 , at which time the concession and property of the French Canal Company were purchased for $40,000,000 . Negotiations were opened with Colombia by the United States to secure a canal concession , but Colombia 's demands were so exorbitant that negotiations failed . At this juncture , the State of Panama , in November , 1903 , declared itself independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a payment of $10,000 , - 000 , granted the United States a concession to build a canal from Colon to Panama . The United States began construction in a preliminary way in 1904 . The Canal Concession. ? The treaty concluded between the United States and Panama on February 23 , 1904 , gave the United States control over a strip of territory ten miles wide ? five miles on each side of the center line of the canal ? extending from Colon to Panama . The United States has the right to construct , maintain , and operate the canal and to govern the country within the Canal Zone , exceptions being made of the small town of Colon and of the city of Panama , which have their own municipal government subject to the laws of Panama . The United States , however , was given the right to put these two cities in sanitary condition by providing them with sewers , paving their streets , and furnishing them , at reasonable rates , with a supply of pure water . As stated above , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also agreed to pay the republic of Panama $250,000 a year , beginning nine years after the date of the ratification of the treaty ? a sum which Colombia was receiving from the Panama Railroad Company , the ownership of whose lines was secured by the United States when it bought out the French company . The United States Government owns and governs the Canal Zone , but the political sovereignty over this territory remains with the republic of Panama which is technically not dispossessed of any of its territory . The Three Preliminary Problems. ? Before the actual work of constructing the canal could be begun , or rather before the work could be carried far , three preliminary problems had to be solved : First of all it was necessary to put the Canal Zone and // the cities of Colon and Panama in a thoroughly sanitary condition . Like most Spanish-American cities , they were quite otherwise when the United States took possession of the Canal Zone . At the present time , due to the admirable work of Colonel William C. Gorgas , a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanitation on the Isthmus , the health conditions are everything that could be desired . It took about two years to put the Canal Zone in order from a health point of view , and since then the death rate has been surprisingly low . Another preliminary problem of great importance was that of deciding whether the work of excavation and construction should be done directly by the United States Government or whether the work should be let out to one or more contractors . Knowing that it would take some time to secure the detailed and exact information which contractors would need to have in order to make intelligent bids , the Government early set at work a small force to determine unit costs for doing the work . It was ultimately found impossible to secure satisfactory bids from contractors , and the United States at the end of two years , decided to proceed with the execution of the work itself . The third and largest preliminary question to be settled was what the type of canal shouldbe ? whether it should be a sea-level waterway , or one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favored a lock project . In order to secure the fullest possible information on this most important question , President Roosevelt referred the matter to a board of consulting engineers of thirteen members , five of whom were foreigners . The report of this board did not make the settlement of the question much easier ; because the majority of the board , inTHE // eluding the five foreign members and three of the Americans , reported in favor of a sea-level canal . However , the lock project was favored by a majority of the American engineers on the consulting board and by a majority of the engineers on the board that had been appointed to construct the canal . President Roosevelt referred the matter to Congress which wisely decided in favor of a canal with locks . The Canal Route and Project. ? The canal now being constructed extends from Limon Bay on the Caribbean shore , near Colon , to the bay of Panama which it enters a short distance from the city of Panama . The length of the canal will be 50 miles , 41 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Panama Bay end another dredged channel of about the same length is necessary in order to reach 40 feet of water in that bay . For nearly three fifths of the length , the canal route is in the valley of the Chagres River , a typical torrential stream which // enters the Caribbean near , but not through , Limon Bay . The part of the Chagres River valley used by the canal will be converted into a lake , which is shown on the accompanying map representing the Isthmus of Panama as it will appear after the canal is completed . The route may be described as follows : Starting from the Caribbean , there is a dredged channel through the shallow Limon Bay for a distance of 42 miles to the shore line . The channel is continued through the swampy region inland for 32 miles to a point where the Chagres River has made a wide opening in the Gatun hills ? a low range extending nearly parallel with the coast . At this point a huge dam , 7,700 feet in length , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gatun hills and convert a large part of the Chagres River valley into a lake , the surface area of which will be 171 square miles . The level of this lake will be from 85 to 87 feet above the sea . To overcome this difference in level , there are three locks at Gatun each one having a lift of 29 feet . There will be a double flight of locks , i. e. , twin locks on each level . The locks will have a length of 1,000 feet , a width of 110 feet , and a depth of 40 feet . From the Gatun locks , the canal route will be in the lake for 22 miles to Gamboa where , at a sharp bend in the Chagres valley , the canal route leaves the river valley and crosses the divide between the two oceans . Here in the divide is where the deep canal cut is being dug . The length of the cut will be between 7 and 8 miles , the deepest portion of which will be through the Culebra hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bay of Panama , the canal passes out of the deep cut ; and , at this point , a lock with a lift of 30 feet lowers the canal to an elevation of 55 feet above the level of the Pacific at mean tide . Between Pedro Miguel and Miraflores , there will be // a small lake about 11 miles in length ; and at Miraflores two locks will overcome the difference in level between the lake and that of the bay of Panama . The locks at Pedro Miguel and Miraflores have the same dimensions as those at Gatun , and are also constructed in pairs . From the Miraflores locks , the canal extends across the swampy country to La Boca ? the mouth of the Rio Grande ? and on , as a submerged channel 41 miles , into the bay of Panama . The depth of the canal in the earth sections and submarine portions will be 41 feet ; through the deep cut , 45 feet . The width of the canal will vary with different sections . The sea-level channels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the lake , the breadth of the channel will vary from 1,000 to 500 feet , and in the deep cut the bottom width will be 300 feet . The dimensions of this canal will far exceed those of any other canal in the world . The construction will reach the highest attainable standards , and the construction of all locks in pairs will be a guarantee against interruption in the use of the canal , and will enable the waterway to accommodate all or more than all the commerce that may seek to pass from sea to sea . The Control of the Chagres River. ? The one great prob240 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION lem connected with the successful construction and maintenance of the Panama Canal is the control of the Chagres River . This stream rises in the hills forming the divide between the two oceans , flows to the Northwest for half of its course , then turns nearly at a right angle and flows north into the Atlantic Ocean . It will be remembered that the trend of the Isthmus in the neighborhood of the canal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This accounts for the fact that the town of Colon is 20 miles west of the city of Panama , and that the general direction of the canal is from northwest to southeast . In its upper and middle courses the Chagres River flows through a welldefined valley bounded by comparatively high hills . In the neighborhood of Bohio , about 15 miles from the mouth of the river , the stream leaves the high country and meanders across a swampy district , passes through an opening in the Gatun hills and reenters the swampy district from which it flows into the sea . At low water there is only about one foot of fall from Bohio to the sea . During the rainy season the Chagres River is subject to extreme floods , the river having been known to rise nearly 40 feet in twenty-four hours . It was necessary to locate the canal in the valley of the torrential Chagres River and to make provision either to take the waters of the river into the canal , or to keep them safely away from the proposed waterway . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake occupying nearly half of the valley of the river , and this body of water will be large enough to take care of the Chagres floods . In order to form this lake , however , the construction of the Gatun dam is necessary ; thus the whole canal project hinges upon the successful construction of this dam . Fortunately , the engineers have solved this // question beyond any reasonable doubt . " The Gatun dam is to consist of two piles of rock 1,200 feet apart and carried up to 60 feet above mean tide . The space between them and up to the required height is to be filled by selected material deposited in place by the hydraulic process . " This great structure will be 7,700 feet in length and will rise well above the level of the lake . The dam thus constructed of earth and rock will form a huge dike a half mile or more in width . It is believed that this plan of construction will make the darn unquestionably able to stand any strain that may be put upon it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal were to be constructed , the solution of the Chagres River problem would be much more difficult . It would then be necessary to keep the water of the Chagres River out of the canal , and in order to do so it would be necessary to provide an artificial channel to the Caribbean on each side of the canal to carry off the Chagres water . The natural channel would not suffice . To maintain these channels in time of flood and to keep the water from // breaking into the intermediate and lower-lying canal trench would be extremely difficult , in view of the fact that there is practically no descent in the general level of the country from Bohio to the Atlantic Ocean . The flood waters of the Chagres River would have to be held back by damming not only the upper portions of the Chagres River , but also the important tributaries which enter the Chagres in its lower course . In a word , the technical problems connected with the construction of a tide-level canal would be more ' serious than those to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that such a waterway when constructed would be less serviceable to commerce than the lock canal will be with the large Gatun Lake . Work Accomplished and Rate of Progress. ? The construction of the Panama Canal requires the handling of no less than 214,666,595 cubic yards of earth and rock . In the accompanying diagram the area of the entire circle represents the total amount of material to be moved . The diagram shows how much of the work was done by the French Company before the United States began operations , and it also indicates what has been done month by month since January 1 , 1907 . Up to 1907 , excavations proceeded slowly because the work was then being organized ; during the year 1907 , the progress was also relatively slow ; but since January 1 , 1908 , the material has been handled with unexpected rapidity . At the present time nearly 3,000,000 cubic yards of material are being excavated each month . At this rate , the excavation work can be completed by the end of 1912 . There are three big tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the canal trench , in the deep cut and for the foundations for the locks . Another task is the construction of the great dam at Gatun ; and the third is // the masonry work for the locks . It is now evident that it will take longer to complete the locks than to do the other parts of the work . It is fully expected that the canal will be open for use in 1915 . The Canal and the Navy. ? The canal is being constructed by the United States for three reasons : to make its navy more efficient , to serve the needs of commerce , and to enable the industries of the country to develop more rapidly . At present , the two seaboards of the United States are separated by a water route 13,000 to 15,000 miles in length ; it thus becomes necessary to maintain strong naval fleets on both oceans . With an Isthmian canal , our seaboards will be brought within 4,000 to 5,000 miles of each other and it will be possible to transfer fleets and squadrons from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of our navy to protect our seaboards will be practically doubled . The necessity for this waterway from a naval point of view was brought strongly to the attention of the American people by the celebrated trip of the Oregon from our Pacific coast to the West Indies at the opening of the war with Spain in 1898 . Fortunately , the Oregon arrived at the West Indies in good condition and in time to be of service ; but the length of her trip and the risks she ran in making the journey showed how ineffective a fleet on one ocean would be to strike a blow against an enemy upon the other ocean . Again , in 1908 , the possible importance of an Isthmian canal to our navy was illustrated by the cruise of the American fleet of battleships around the world . We then realized how long it takes for a naval fleet to pass from one sea to another and what risks are incurred in navigating the Strait of Magellan . The Canal and Commerce. ? The Panama Canal will // benefit American commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic and Pacific seaboards ; ( 2 ) by shortening the distance from our Atlantic and Gulf ports to western , central , and south America , Australasia , China , and Japan ; and ( 3 ) by reducing the distance from our western coasts to Europe by nearly one half . The following table gives the distances via existing routes and by way of the Panama Canal between our two seaboards and between each of our coasts and typical ports in different parts of the world . While the main service of the canal will be to shorten ocean routes , it will also serve commerce by reducing the risks connected with passing the Strait of Magellan ; and // it will also make the mercantile marine of the United States and other countries more effective in the performance of their transportation services . The shorter and safer routes via the canal will reduce the expenses of international commerce and will increase the volume of trade . The Canal and Industrial Progress. ? In considering the influence of the Panama Canal the fact should be kept in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canal will be that of assisting in the development of the industries of the Pacific coast States , of the middle , western , and southern sections of the country , and of the manufacturing New England and middle Atlantic States . While the canal will be used by ocean carriers , its main benefits will accrue to the farmers , manufacturers , lumbermen , and miners in different parts of our richly endowed country .  | Volume and Value of Ocean Freight Traffic. ? The total value of the foreign trade of the United States , import and export , now exceeds $3,000,000,000 annually ; the imports comprise about two fifths of the total value , and the exports the other three fifths . The number of tons of cargo handled in the foreign trade can not be precisely determined , but a careful estimate for 1908 makes the total of our imports to be 19,000,000 tons and that of our exports to be 51,688,148 tons . The total cargo tonnage of the imports and exports was approximately 70,688,000 in 1908 . To handle this traffic , vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from foreign countries , and ships with a gross tonnage of 38,281,696 cleared from our ports to foreign destinations . Not all of these vessels were fully loaded ; some of them had part cargoes and others , amounting to twenty-two per cent of the total , entered and cleared in ballast . These vessels were employed solely in the foreign trade . In addition to them , the coastwise commerce of the United States required the use of a fleet of vessels having a gross tonnage of 3,500,000 . The total of entrances and clearances for the coastwise commerce is not known , but it of course amounted to several times the tonnage of the vessels . It is probable that the total tonnage of the entrances and clearances of the vessels engaged in the maritime foreign 24S ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION and coastwise commerce of the United States amounts annually to 100,000,000 tons gross register . Causes Accounting for the Growth of the Ocean Freight Traffic. ? The foreign trade of the United States has risen fast in volume and value since 1895 , and its continued growth is certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States gives rise to a corresponding expansion of international trade . The large increase in the ocean freight business has been the result , first of all , of a cheapening in the cost of transportation that has permitted the shipment of coal and other minerals , fertilizers , and various other bulky products across wide oceans . It has been only since 1870 that it was possible to handle large quantities of low grade freight over the longer ocean routes . Another class of traffic that has latterly entered largely into ocean commerce has consisted of fruits , meats , and other perishable commodities requiring refrigeration , special warehousing facilities , speedy transportation , and prompt delivery . The law of the development of ocean freight traffic may be stated as follows : the transportation service upon the ocean has become cheaper for all classes of traffic ; faster for such articles as require rapid transit , more reliable with the substitution of steam for sails , and more specialized with reference to the service to be performed . The fruit steamer , the tank steamer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel with reference to the work which it performs . The Three Parts of the Ocean Freight Service. ? The exchange of commodities between the shippers of one country and the consignees in another country requires three transportation services : ( 1 ) the vessel services or the carriage of commodities from port to port ; ( 2 ) the traffic services conTHE // nected with the forwarding of and accounting for freight ; and ( 3 ) the transfer and other terminal services . It will be well to consider briefly each of these three parts of the ocean freight service . The transportation or carriage of ocean freight is performed in part by vessels operated as ocean lines and in part by individual ships managed by those who own them or lease them . When the traffic over any given route is of large volume and of relatively constant quantity , companies will establish lines of vessels and provide for fixed sailings from the ports at each end of the route . The number of vessels employed and the frequency of the sailings will depend upon the volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one season to another . Line traffic is of three general kinds : ( 1 ) Lines consisting of the largest and fastest ships ? the express steamers ? which carry only passengers and the mails and parcels ; ( 2 ) those lines using steamers of moderate speed operated both for the passenger traffic and for the transportation of freight ; and ( 3 ) freight lines employing vessels that carry no passengers whatever . With the rapid growth of ocean commerce there has been a great increase in the number of lines that carry freight only . A surprisingly large share of the heavy freight traffic of the ocean is handled by vessels operated as single units . As most of the vessels thus operated are chartered by those who use them , this traffic is called charter traffic . An individual or company desiring to ship a full cargo of coal , of lumber , of structural iron , locomotives , wheat , corn , or cotton , charters a vessel to perform the service , or pays some other person who has chartered a vessel an agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination . It is possible , by applying to a shipbroker , for any manu250 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION facturer or exporter to secure a vessel to take his cargo from a port in any country to practically any port of the world . A chartered vessel is not limited to any particular route , as a line vessel is ; nor is it required to sail upon any fixed date . Traffic Services of the Shipbroker and Freight Forwarder . ? By means of the telegraph and the ocean cable , shipbrokers in every seaport in the world keep informed in regard to the movements of vessels that may be chartered at any particular time for handling different kinds of cargo . They secure vessels for those who wish to use them in much the same way that the real estate agent secures a house for the man who wishes to rent one . Traffic services of quite as great importance are performed by the freight forwarder who solicits shipments both from seaboard and interior points to foreign destination ; likewise in the same manner , he solicits import traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the goods from the time they leave the shipper until they are received by the consignee . If the goods originate inland , they are transported by a railroad company to the seaboard and thence are reshipped by the freight forwarder , either upon his vessels or upon those owned by somebody else , to the most convenient foreign port , where the goods are taken in charge by the freight forwarder 's agent who sends the articles on to their ultimate destination . When the goods leave the shipper at the inland point , they are usually billed through to ultimate destination via the city in which the freight forwarder 's main offices are located , and also via the ocean ship line which he employs or controls . After the goods leave the shipper , he is relieved from all further care as to their transportation and delivery . Figure // His through bill of lading gives him a receipt for the value of the goods that he has turned over to the railroad company , the initial carrier . Before the goods start on their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consignee or purchaser of the goods to the amount of their value , attaches to this draft the through bill of lading and the insurance policy , takes the documents to his bank and receives from the bank the value of the goods less the ordinary business discount . Thus the shipper is immediately able to use his capital in further production . This economical and safe organization of international trade and ocean transportation has been made possible by the freight forwarder . Ocean Shipping Papers. ? In the shipping of ocean freight and the operation of vessels to carry that freight , nine important papers are required : ( 1 ) A receipt for freight is received by the shipper upon delivery of each dray load or lighter load of freight to the ocean carrier . This paper is also spoken of as a wharf receipt . ( 2 ) The receipts for freight are exchanged for a bill of lading giving the names of the consignor and the consignee , describing the goods , stating their weight or tonnage , their destination , and the rate of freight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the original being retained by the shipper , one being kept by the captain , while the third is sent to the consignee . Bills of lading are negotiable . ( 3 ) An invoice of the goods must be prepared by the exporter , describing the several articles of freight , stating the prices paid , or the value of the commodities . The correctness of this invoice must be certified to by the resident Consul from the country to which the freight is being // shipped . This invoice is sent with the bill of lading to the foreign consignee who must present both papers to the customs officers in order to secure possession of the goods . ( 4 ) A manifest is made out containing a list and description of all the goods carried on each ship . The ship 's manifest contains " the name or names of the places , where the goods on board have been laden , and the place or places to which they are respectively destined ; a particular account and description of all the packages on board with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages , the names of the respective shippers and consignees , as far as such particulars are known to the master of the ship . " ( 5 ) A clearance must be secured from the collector of the port before the vessel can start on its journey . In Figure order to secure the clearance , the master of the ship must file a copy of the manifest of the vessel 's cargo , and he must also have complied with all conditions required by the Government . ( 6 ) Before sailing , the master of the ship secures a bill of health from the collector of the port , stating what are the general health conditions of the port . If there are no dangerous or contagious diseases prevalent , a clean bill of health is issued . ( 7 ) Every master of a vessel possesses a document called the ship 's articles containing the names of all the members of the crew and the title of the position each man fills . ( 8 ) The master must also possess the ship 's register , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag the vessel sails . The register states the name of the vessel , dimensions , tonnage , etc. ( 9 ) Lastly , before sailing , the master of the vessel applies to the resident consul of the country in which the ship 's destination is located to secure the consular vise of the ship 's manifest , clearance , and other documents . The consul issues a certificate as to the accuracy of the documents , especially of the correctness of the statements , made in the ship 's bill of health . When a vessel enters a port , the master must file the ship 's manifest with the customs officials , and he must deposit the articles and register with the consul of the country under whose flag the ship sails . When the master is ready to sail , these documents are returned to him after he has fulfilled the conditions above described . Transfer and Terminal Services. ? Economy and dispatch in the handling of ocean freight depend largely upon the facilities for storing and transferring freight at terminals . // In the best organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are controlled and managed by the authority which has control of the port . If it is a municipal port the administration is by the authority of the city government ; if a semipublic port , by a harbor " trust " ; if a private port , probably by a railroad corporation . In most American cities , however , each railroad or general carrier provides such facilities as may be necessary to its particular business . The administration of the terminal facilities by a single authority , as at Antwerp and Hamburg , has many advantages . The quays in those and other ports similarly managed are equipped with capstans , cranes and derricks , operated from a power plant , usually hydraulic ; special machinery for handling ore , coal , and grain are provided ; facilities are provided in one section of the port for handling certain kinds of cargo and in other sections for different classes of commodities ; storage or warehouse accommodations are provided in each section of the port according to its needs . In this way , terminal expenses can be reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization that should be adopted wherever political and other conditions are favorable.  | Luxury and Safety of Ocean Travel. ? In the transportation of freight , every effort is made to reduce cost ; but , in the passenger service , speed and safety rather than economy are the objects sought . Year by year , the luxury and safety of ocean travel become greater and , to secure these better services , travelers are willing to pay higher rates . In the early days of ocean travel it was customary for all people religiously inclined to request prayers for a safe journey ; now few people regard the risk of ocean travel as being any greater than the dangers of a railroad journey ? as a matter of fact , the risks are less on the sea than on the railways . With ocean steamships from 500 to 800 feet in length , from 65 to 90 feet in breadth , built with numerous watertight bulkheads , with double steel bottom , and provided with twin screws , the dangers of ocean travel have been reduced to a minimum ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite equal to those to be obtained at a first-class hotel in a large city . It is , of course , still possible for ships to strike hidden rocks and to collide with each other ; but accidents are seldom serious when they occur near shore or even when some distance out at sea ; because the vessels can make their condition and wants known by wireless communication with the shore or with passing ships . // Volume of Cabin and Steerage Traffic. ? The passenger traffic on the ocean has increased with surprising rapidity . In 1898 the total number of passengers arriving at American ports from other countries was 343,963 . In 1907 the figures were 1,630,266 . The larger part of this great increase was the result of the growth in the third-class traffic . The immigrants entering the United States rose from 229 , - 299 in 1898 to 1,285,349 in 1907 . The high tide of immigrant traffic was reached in 1907 , there having been a temporary falling off in 1908 due to the financial depression prevailing in the United States during that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to rise , and the figures for 1910 and subsequent years will doubtless exceed those of any previous year . Cabin passenger traffic is of about equal volume , outbound and inbound ; but ordinarily the arrivals of steerage passengers in the United States greatly exceed the departures . In 1908 , however , when large numbers of laborers were out of employment , the departures of thirdclass passengers were nearly equal to the arrivals . This indicates greater prosperity and greater mobility on the part of the foreign-born population in the United States than it was supposed to have . The Third-class and Immigrant Traffic has been more profitable to ocean carriers than has the transportation of cabin passengers . A large passenger steamer can carry four or five third-class passengers for each person in the first and second cabin ; expenses are very much less for the steerage passengers ; and , when the steerage is full the steamer 's voyage is highly profitable . This accounts for the systematic efforts made by all the passenger lines running vessels from Europe to America to organize and de262 ELEMENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Low fares , comfortable accommodations on the ocean , and a well-organized system of caring for the immigrant from the time he leaves his home in central Europe until he reaches his friend or destination in America have brought about the very rapid increase in the steerage traffic . One of the latest developments in the handling of the steerage business has been to separate the steerage passengers into third-class and immigrants . A large number of foreigners who are not immigrants travel back and forth across the North Atlantic , and they are willing to pay a somewhat higher rate for more space and greater comfort . When the third-class passengers are separated from the immigrants , they may engage reserved berths in state rooms , their accommodations have baths , and they have a dining room separate from the immigrants . When the passenger steamer reaches its dock at New York , where most of the immigrants enter the United States , the cabin passengers are landed on the company 's pier , while the immigrants are transferred by tender from the steamship to the immigrant station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is examined by the immigration officers and by physicians of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service . After having satisfactorily passed the inspection , the immigrants are transported by special trains to their destination in different parts of the United States . The handling of this immigrant traffic is well organized by the railroad companies , which have divided it up among each other equitably . Development of Ocean Travel. ? Reference has just been made to the systematic and successful efforts of the carriers to organize and increase third-class or steerage traffic . // Numerous agencies have also been created to stimulate and facilitate cabin-passenger travel . The steamship companies themselves spend large sums annually in advertising and in soliciting business . Many private tourist agencies relieve the traveler of business details , secure him hotel accommodations , provide him with banking facilities , and supply him with such guides , couriers , and interpreters as he may desire while traveling in different countries . During recent years university bureaus of travel have made their appearance to supply tourist parties with educated conductors to lecture on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result of all this is that a very large share of the people who travel now do so for its educational value . Formerly , men traveled mainly for // business reasons , and , to some extent , because of their love of adventure ; at the present time , however , it is the desire to see other countries , and learn something of their art and culture , that causes most people to cross the sea . Volume and Growth of Ocean Mails. ? It is estimated by the Post-office Department that during the year ending June 30 , 1908 , there were 308,001,320 pieces of mail sent by sea from the United States to foreign countries . The weight of this mail matter was 14,697,759 pounds ; the mail received from foreign countries was somewhat less , there being 259,122,981 pieces brought to our ports from abroad . The rapidity with which the ocean mails are growing is indicated by the fact that the number of pieces of ocean mail , outbound and inbound , for the year 1908 ( 558,124 , - 301 ) exceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three years having been twenty-six per cent . The total amount of postage received by the United States from the foreign mails was $8,585,564 . The aggregate cost to the United States for the transportation of foreign mails was $3,072,623 ; and , after making a liberal allowance for the cost of transporting the mail between the seaboard and the interior points within the country , the United States Government made a handsome net profit from the international mails . Payment for Carrying Ocean Mails. ? The Post-office Department makes two kinds of payments for the transportation of ocean mails ? contract and noncontract payments . By act of Congress , passed March 3 , 1891 , the Postmaster General was authorized to contract with American steamPASSENGER , // ship companies for periods of five to ten years for the transportation of mails over routes specified by the Postoffice Department . The rate of payment varies with the size and speed of the ship used in carrying the mail . The principal contract is with the American Line of the International Mercantile Marine Company which operates four express steamers between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force with steamship lines over various routes . Under the noncontract system , steamers are paid in accordance with the amount of mail dispatched . If the mail is sent under the noncontract system by a steamer flying the American flag , the United States Government pays the steamship company the rate of the international postage which with most countries is five cents an ounce for letters , i. e. , the steamship company obtains $1,600 a ton for letters and post cards and $160 per ton for other articles . If the steamer is under a foreign flag , the receipts are 4 francs per kilogram ( about 35 cents per pound and $700 per ton ) for letters and post cards , and 50 centimes per kilogram ( about 41 cents a pound and $90 per ton ) for other classes of mail . Sea Post Offices and Terminal Dispatch of the Ocean Mails . ? In order to expedite the dispatch of mails to destination upon the arrival of the steamship , the United States Government maintains sea post offices upon steamers of four of the fastest steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ports , the mail has been sorted and sacked with reference to destination ; and as soon as the vessel reaches quarantine at New York it is met by a special mail boat to which the mail is transferred . " Mails for New York City are immediately sent to the New York Post Office , and those for other places are forwarded to destina266 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION tion at the earliest opportunity practicable " without passing through the New York Post Office . The International Parcels Post. ? Although the United States has not yet established a parcels post in connection with its domestic mail service , it now accepts parcels for transportation to most countries and receives packages from them for delivery in the United States . The international parcels post is arranged for by special agreements between the United States and each foreign country . The rate per pound upon parcels is twelve cents , and in most cases parcels weighing as much as eleven pounds may be dispatched . The number of parcels sent and received through our international parcels post for the year ending June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from year to year is rapid . As the Assistant Postmaster General states : " Its extension to all countries with which we have direct mail communication is desirable " ; and it may be added incidentally that it would be well to establish a similar service in connection with our domestic mails . The Universal Postal Union. ? In 1874 the leading nations of the world signed the Universal Postal Convention regulating the international postal services . In accordance with the provisions of this treaty of 1874 , the several countries formed the Universal Postal Union which meets once in five years in the Universal Postal Congress , composed of delegates from all the governments belonging to the Union . The last Universal Postal Congress met in 1906 at Rome , Italy . This is the legislative body ; the administrative body is called the International Bureau , the offices of which are in Bern , Switzerland . This bureau is in charge of a director , and is under the supervision of the post-office department of Switzerland . Figure // III . The International Express Service The International Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mails , currency , coin , and various articles requiring prompter delivery than can be secured by the ocean freight service . The companies engaged in the foreign express business also do international banking to the extent of providing travelers with checks that can be cashed in any one of the leading cities in Europe . American Companies Engaged in Foreign Express. ? Three of the express companies doing business in the United States have organized an international service . The American Express Company and the United States Express Company handle traffic to and from Europe and other countries reached from our Atlantic seaboard . The express traffic handled from our Pacific coast is carried on mainly by Wells , Fargo &; Company . The Organization of the International Express Service. ? The amount of business which these express companies have in foreign countries is not great enough to require them to maintain offices and agencies in many foreign cities . Each company enters into an exclusive agreement with some foreign agent , and the company consigns all of its foreign express matter to its forwarding agent , who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States in care of the express company with which he has made a contract . The Papers Employed in the Foreign Express Service are similar to those used in tha exportation and importation of freight . The shipper receives from the express company a receipt , such as he would obtain were he sending express matter to some place in the United States . If the shi ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION ment is large the express company issues to the shipper an export bill of lading describing the goods , giving the name of the shipper and the consignee , the destination of the goods , weight and description of the articles , and the rate and amount of agreed through charges . As is the case with a freight bill of lading , this paper is made out in triplicate , one copy being given to the shipper , one kept by the express company , and the third forwarded to the express company 's foreign agent . The bill of lading sent to the foreign agent must be accompanied by the shipper 's invoice or manifest , stating the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may enter the commodities at the customs house . When the express company turns over to the carrier the commodities which it has received from numerous shippers , it makes out a waybill , just as the railroad company does in the shipment of freight . This is the express company 's own record , and it describes the articles , states the origin and destination of the goods , gives the weight , freight charges , total , prepaid , and to be collected . Lastly , the express company receives from the steamship company the steamship bill of lading , describing the goods shipped and the rates to be paid thereon . As this indicates , the express company is a shipper as well as a forwarder for individual shippers . The Business Relations of the Express Company and the Ocean Carrier. ? The express company does not enter into any special or exclusive contracts with steamship companies ; its relation to the ocean carrier is the same as that of other shippers . The express company , like other shippers , pays the regular freight rates on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that carried on within the United States . In the domestic express business , each railroad company gives some one Figure // express company an exclusive monopoly of its parcels traffic . The competition of the international express and the parcels post has greatly increased during recent years . At the present time it is possible for the people of the United States to send by mail packages weighing as much as eleven pounds to thirty-six countries and colonies . The rate of twelve cents per pound by parcels post is lower than the international express rates , and the services within the United States and in foreign countries are more extensive and are prompter . The exchange of traffic between different countries has been greatly facilitated by the general adoption of the international parcels post .  | A High Degree of Organization Necessary. ? To perform the many and complicated services described in the two preceding chapters , it is necessary for the ocean-transportation business to be highly organized . As has been pointed out , the ocean carrier is , for a large part of the traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior part of one country with the consignees in many parts of other countries . Thus the carriers on the high seas must cooperate not only with each other but with inland transportation agencies . The ideal sought to be reached in the development of transportation organization is to secure economy , speed , safety , and regularity in handling the tens of millions of tons of freight and hundreds of thousands of persons that are annually carried over the sea . Stages in the Development of the Organization of Ocean Transportation. ? Transportation on the high seas has been performed in various ways at different times in the history of the world . The present state of efficiency is the result of a long evolution , the principal stages of which have been as follows : 1 . When commerce revived after the disintegration of the Roman Empire and merchants began to send their ships on long voyages , they united their vessels into a merchant fleet which was accompanied by naval convoys . // The Venetian fleet had its regular sailings to different parts of the commercial world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by Venetian merchants and the vessels were sent out in fleets in order that the government might protect them against pirates and enemies upon the land . 2 . A second stage in the evolution of commerce and ocean transportation was the union of commercial cities into a league such as the IIanseatic League of the northern German cities . From 1300 to 1600 the international trade of northern Europe was controlled mainly by the powerful IIanseatic League , which secured , and maintained by force of arms , almost complete monopoly of the commerce about the Baltic and North seas . 3 . As the nations of Europe developed , and their governments became stronger in the latter part of the Middle Ages , numerous trading companies came into existence . The Venetian trading fleets and the Hanseatic League were supplanted by trading companies chartered by England and France , each company being given the monopoly of the trade between its country and some section of the world , cr a monopoly of the trade in some staples with certain parts of the world . The trading companies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given large political authority in India , Africa , America , and the other frontier regions where new commerce was being built up . The trading companies had two general types of organization . In part they were associations of individuals , each trading with his own capital and ships according to the rules of the company with which he was associated ; the other form of organization was the stock company , trade being carried on by the company with joint stock . Some of the large trading companies combined both forms of organization . As examples of the great trading companies , // the British East India Company , the Dutch West India Company , and the Muscovy Company may be cited . America was settled by four trading companies ? the London , Plymouth , Dutch West India , and the Canada companies . Each of these companies , at the outset , was given the monopoly of the trade with a part of America , and was given the authority to govern the region covered by its grant of territory . These companies failed as commercial organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were serviceable in starting the colonization of the new continent . 4 . When , in the second quarter . of the seventeenth century , the London , Plymouth , and Dutch West India companies lost their monopoly of American commerce , trade with the New World was taken up and carried on by individual merchants , each trader operating as many ships as his business required . To some extent the people of the New World exported their products in their own ships , the vessels being owned by the southern planters and the New England fishermen , lumbermen , and farmers . With the growth of the trade , American merchants and traders came to share with the British traders the commerce between the Old World and the New ; and , before the end of the eighteenth century , large merchant traders like Derby , cf Salem , Peabody , of Boston , and Girard , of Philadelphia , had come to be relatively numerous . The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were the period of the merchant trader . 5 . Since the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by common carriers and not by merchants . In England the merchants began to employ common carriers about the beginning of the century ; in America little is heard of the common car276 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION rier as distinct from the merchant until the close of the War of 1812-15 . While international trade was relatively small and irregular in volume , exchanges were made by merchants using their own vessels ; but , when the flow of commerce became large and regular , the work of the merchant carrier was divided and the transportation services on the ocean , as had long since been the case with transportation on the land , were taken over by common carriers . At the beginning , as at the present time , common carriers might own the ships they used or might charter them ; moreover , they might operate vessels as units or unite several vessels into a line and establish schedule sailings. 6 . The first ocean lines were the packet lines of sailing vessels , the pioneer in the United States being the Black Ball Line , which began running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Civil War most of the commerce between the United States and Europe was handled by these packet ships . Lines of steamships were put into operation by British companies in 1840 ; after that date they increased rapidly , and soon secured most of the mail , express , and passenger business . Only a few transatlantic steamship lines were started by Americans before the Civil War . 7 . Although a large part of the commerce of the world throughout the nineteenth century was handled by vessels operated as single units , the greater portion of the traffic from 1820 to about 1870 was carried by the sailing packet and steamship lines ; but about 1870 a large development of charter traffic began . This is due to the fact that the marine engine had become efficient enough by that time to make it profitable to use steamers in handling bulk cargoes . A large tonnage of chartered steamers was put into servORGANIZATION // ice during the last third of the century ; and at the present time it is probable that more than half of the tonnage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , however , international commerce is becoming so large and so regular as to lead to the establishment of many strictly freight lines ; and much traffic that formerly was handled by chartered vessels is now handled by steamships operated as lines with sailings almost as regular as prevail in the passenger service . It seems probable that charter traffic will tend to decline with the future progress of ocean commerce . 8 . During recent years there have been three striking tendencies manifest in the development of ocean transportation : One has been the rise of the mammoth steamship company . The largest of these companies , the HamburgAmerican , had a fleet of less than 200,000 tons of vessels in 1890 ; at the present time its tonnage is nearly 1,000,000 . The North German Lloyd Company is two thirds as large as the Ilamburg-American . Each of several British companies has between 250,000 and 500,000 tons of ships . The organization of ocean transportation , as well as that of industry , has brought about the establishment of the giant corporation . 9 . Another recent tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large steamship companies . This is typified by the International Mercantile Marine Company , which in 1902 brought under one management five transatlantic lines whose aggregate fleet of 136 vessels had a tonnage of 1,034,884 . The success of the International Mercantile Marine Company has been but moderate , and has not encouraged the formation of other similar federations . From time to time rumors are heard of the consolidation of the two great German corn278 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION panies , and their union in the not distant future is more than probable . 10 . Another marked phase of commercial organization is the union of ocean transportation with production . The Standard Oil Company , for instance , operates a large number of vessels on the ocean ; the United States Steel Corporation has a fleet of ore vessels on the lakes , and many coal and lumber companies have their own coastwise fleets of vessels and barges . This is , in part , a return to the ocean transportation methods that prevailed in the days of the merchant carrier , and it is probable that the progressive integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over the transportation services .  | Competition on the Ocean is Widespread and Keen. ? Upon all the main-traveled ocean routes there are several lines , each seeking to obtain as much traffic as possible ; while everywhere and at all times vessels may be chartered to handle cargoes in bulk , if shippers feel that the rates and facilities offered by the line vessels are inadequate or unreasonable . Ocean carriers compete with each other much more actively than do railway companies , and there are four causes that account for this : 1 . The ocean is a free highway , which any man who owns or charters a ship may use . Every port of the world is open to the ships of all countries , and it matters little whether the terminal facilities of a seaport are owned and managed by public authority , or are the property of individuals and corporations ; whatever the ownership of the facilities may be , their use is public . 2 . The ocean is a universal highway connecting each seaport with every other ocean port in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from practically every seaport to every country on the globe . He is not dependent upon line vessels which operate over fixed routes , but he may secure the services of the chartered vessel ; thus the competition on the seas , like the tides , reaches every shore . // 3 . It is easy to engage in the ocean transportation business . A limited amount of capital will purchase a ship , but even that is unnecessary because vessels may be chartered , just as houses may be leased . The exporter of cotton , lumber , grain , coal , iron , or any other commodity moved in large quantities may always secure the services of chartered vessels at competitive rates . 4 . It is as easy to retire from the business of ocean transportation as it is to enter it ; for this reason men do not hesitate to charter vessels nor to invest money in them . Although the shipowner may find his capital idle during periods of depression , trade is sure to revive ; and it then is possible for him to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a railroad is constructed the capital becomes fixed ; but when a ship is built , it represents a more mobile form of investment . Restraint of Ocean Competition a Necessity. ? The competitive forces in ocean transportation are so powerful that it is necessary to regulate them . If this can not be done , the rivalries of carriers tend to become destructive , and thus to endanger both the property of the owners of the vessels and the welfare of the public they serve . It is practically impossible to restrain , to any great extent , the competition of chartered vessels with each other for bulk traffic . As long as there are vessels to be leased , this competition will continue ; but the situation is somewhat different as regards the rivalry of ocean lines . The competition among the great steamship companies is local , but inevitably intense . Each corporation has a heavy investment at stake , and the prize to be gained by successful competition is large . The line that is most successful in securing the cabin and steerage traffic across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best mail contracts , or is // most successful in obtaining the remunerative package and commodity freight over these routes , secures a profitable business of large volume and of certain growth . The struggles of ocean giants for prizes so great are apt to be destructive of both combatants . As with rival railroads , so with competing steamship companies , cooperation to regulate competition is necessary . The Ocean Carriers Restrain Competition by " Conferences . " ? The associations which ocean carriers have established to regulate competition are called " conferences . " It is the practice for the lines from Europe or from the United States to each important section of the world to unite in a conference , such as the South African Conference , the China Conference , and the Australian Conference of the European lines . In some instances the steamship lines from the United States are members of the conference to which European lines belong ; and sometimes American lines have their own separate associations . Types of Conferences. ? Conferences of ocean carriers are established for various purposes and have different forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . The informal association which brings together for conference the representatives of steamship lines operating from any port . At these informal conferences , consideration will be given to the dates of sailing , the frequency of the service , classification of traffic and rates , and other matters of mutual interest . The purpose of these conferences is to come to a mutual understanding ; and , if possible , to get common action without formal agreement . 2 . Formal conferences in which the members unite in an association with a chairman , secretary , and other offi282 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION cers . The North Atlantic Steam Traffic Conference , which has been in existence for many years , is a good example of this type . This organization has done much to harmonize the conflicting interests of its members ; but it has only partially , and then for a short time , succeeded in regulating competitive freight rates . 3 . An association of the owners of sailing vessels to f minimum freight rates is another form of conference . This is exemplified by the Sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1903 for the object of fixing minimum rates of freight for the principal voyages in which sailing vessels are engaged in bringing freight to European ports from countries outside of that Continent . The difficulties of enforcing agreements as to sailing-vessel rates are so great that the permanent success of this form of organization is doubtful . 4 . The Chamber of Shipping of the United Kingdom is a general organization in which the leading British ocean carriers have membership . The association is similar to a chamber of commerce . It is concerned with general questions of slipping policy , and does not attempt to regulate competition , rates , or services of rival carriers . Activities of Ocean Conferences. ? The conferences of ocean carriers are established to deal with one or more of the following questions : ( a ) The formal and informal agreements of the members of the conference to fix or regulate the rates on competitive traffic ; indeed , the primary purpose of the conference is to limit the effect of competition upon ocean rates . Enforcement of rate agreements is difficult , frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition even among conference lines can be only very partially controlled . Where pooling of rates from competiCONSOLIDATIONS // tive traffic is possible , competition can be successfully regulated ; but pooling is practicable only to a very limited extent . ( b ) Another question that is dealt with by conference is the classification of ocean freight . While most of the traffic carried on the ocean is handled at commodity rates , it has been found possible to group package and general cargo freight handled over some routes into five to seven classes . The commodities exported from the United States are mostly of a bulky character , and classification is not general ; but those from Europe to different parts of the world consisting , as they do , largely of manufactures , have been successfully classified , and rates are largely by classes instead of by commodities . ( c ) Another function of the conference is to assist in the enforcement of the policy of granting a rebate to shippers who patronize only vessels belonging to conference lines . In order to induce shippers not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival lines , it is customary , particularly in Great Britain , for the steamship companies who are members of a conference to grant to their shippers a rebate of ten per cent from the freight rates in case the shippers have not sent any traffic by nonconference lines . Rebates are calculated each year , six months after the close of the rebate period . There has been some controversy as to the justice of the rebate policy , but it does not seem that the practice has been to the disadvantage of the shippers . By being freed from the interference of dangerous rivals , the companies operating the conference lines can furnish shippers with regular sailings and with an adequate supply of tonnage ; and can guarantee that all shippers shall be charged equal rates for equal services . This enables manufacturers and // merchants to develop their business under most satisfactory conditions . ( d ) Conference agreements sometimes provide for the territorial division of business among its members . There are a few instances of the division of the traffic to and from certain ports among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) There are , lastly , conference agreements providing for the pooling of profits on competitive business . The maintenance of such pools is very difficult , because of the highly competitive character of ocean transportation ; and the result has been that profit pools have been few in number and of relatively short duration . Instability of Ocean Conferences. ? It is not to be inferred from the foregoing discussion of ocean conferences that their membership includes all ocean carriers , or that the conferences are permanent organizations . When times are prosperous and all ships are employed , it is relatively easy to enforce conference agreements ; but when business is scare and ships are idle , the temptation to violate the terms of the agreement is too strong to withstand . The inability of rival carriers to control competition adequately by means of the conference has led to the absorption of weaker lines by strong ones , and the consolidation of some of the largest ocean carriers in order thereby to control more successfully competitive rates and services . The tendency of ocean carriers to consolidate is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maim lain and operate several rival lines than one consolidated or federated line . As in railway transportation and i l l manufacturing , the economy of large scale organizations has been a strong incentive to the consolidation of competing concerns . // Cooperation of Ocean and Rail Carriers. ? Commerce is now organized with a view to the prompt and economical shipments of commodities from any point of production directly to all places of consumption , and to make this possible a high degree of cooperation between rail and ocean carriers is necessary . When the railways are entirely distinct from the ocean lines they have their through traffic arrangements , which are operated sometimes with and sometimes without the assistance of the freight forwarder . The Hamburg-American Packet Company , for instance , has its own soliciting agents in the principal inland cities of the United States as well as of Europe ; so that shipments , whether eastbound or westbound , are handled from shipper to consignee on through bills of lading . Combination of Ocean and Rail Transportation. ? The railroads leading to the North Atlantic seaporfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business was well developed ; but the railroads to the Pacific ports were not thus served by ocean lines ; consequently the leading steamship lines from the Pacific ports of the United States have been established and are now operated by the transcontinental railway companies . By doing this , our railways to the Pacific have made it possible for the people in the Central West and the eastern portions of the United States to exchange commodities directly with the people of the Orient , and facilities for through shipment without rebilling have been provided . Naturally , the principal object the railroad company has sought to accomplish in operating steamship lines has been to increase its railway traffic . Most of the transcontinental roads have lines 2,000 miles in length , which as yet have relatively light t raffle . All of the freight , export and import , handled by steamships is also rail tonnage , which adds to the coin286 ELEMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION pany 's net revenues . It is commonly stated that the railroad steamship lines of the Pacific have generally not been profitable as ocean carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased revenues they have brought to the railroad . There are a few railway lines on the Atlantic , for instance , the one from Newport News to Liverpool and London , controlled by the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway , and the Philadelphia Transatlantic Line to London and Avonmouth , much of the capital for which was supplied by the Philadelphia &; Reading Railway . The Canadian Pacific also has a transatlantic line . Several of the strong coastwise lines , as , for instance , those of the Old Colony Steamboat Company and the Morgan Line , are controlled by the railroads . In general , however , ocean transportation to and from our Atlantic and Gulf ports is carried on by carriers not controlled by the railway companies .  | Cabin and Steerage Fares. ? The competition of the principal steerage lines for the passenger traffic is constant and active , their rivalry to secure the steerage business being especially keen . Ordinarily , however , it is possible for the relatively small number of companies engaged in the ocean passenger traffic to regulate their competition by agreements as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fares charged passengers in the first and second cabins are decided upon year by year without serious difficulty , and the agreements are not often broken . In the steerage business , rate wars occur more frequently , because of the fluctuation in the volume of steerage traffic , and because of the large profits that can be obtained by any line that is able to keep its steerage accommodations fully occupied . The competition for the cabin-passenger business has brought about frequent improvements in speed and comfort . The tendency of the steamship companies has been to offer cabin passengers a luxurious service and to charge higher rates year by year . There seems to be an unquestioned demand for this on the part of travelers , due doubtless to the fact that those who take trips abroad are able to pay high rates . In the immigrant services there has also been a great increase in comfort ; and the third- and fourth-class passengers have the same advantages in speed // that the cabin passengers have . The rates charged for the steerage , however , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic has been so rapid that the steamship companies have been able to provide better services at constant or declining fares , this is one explanation for the rapid growth in the volume of steerage traffic . The Ocean Freight Services may be Grouped under Thrce Headings. ? ( a ) The transportation of commodities as full cargoes , usually in chartered vessels ; ( b ) the carriage of freight as berth and supplemental cargo , usually by line ships , but sometimes in chartered vessels ; and ( c ) the handling of package freight and general cargo , in part at regular rates , and also to some extent at rates fixed by bargaining between the shipper and carrier . Each class of service has its own peculiar rates . Trip and Time Charters. ? Persons wishing to secure the use of a vessel which they do not own may charter it . If the vessel is desired merely to carry a single cargo across the sea , it is chartered for the trip ; if , however , the shipper or freight forwarder wishes to use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , he charters it for a certain length of time ; thus there are trip charters and time charters . When the shipper secures a vessel for a single trip , the ship is operated by the owner who pays all expenses including the terminal charges . The only payment made by the shipper or charterer to the owner or operator of the vessel is an agreed rate per ton on the cargo ; or , in the case of grain , a certain rate per bushel or quarter . The contract between the owner and charterer of a vessel is different in the case of a time charter . In this instance , the man who owns the vessel operates it , provides and feeds the crew , and keeps the ship in repair ; while the // charterer furnishes the fuel and pays all port and terminal charges . The payment for vessels secured upon time charters is an agreed amount per month per net register ton of the vessel . Ordinarily the time charter rates will be equal to about one dollar per ton of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 7,000 tons dead weight capacity will charter for $7,000 per month . Charter rates , both trip and time , are highly competitive and fluctuate with every change in the relation of traffic to available shipping . How Vessels are Chartered. ? The owners of vessels charter them to shippers and freight forwarders through the agency of the shipbrokers , and in every large seaport there are numerous shipbrokers ' offices . Trip charters are much more numerous than time charters . As soon as a vessel leaves a port in any part of the world with a cargo that has been shipped under a trip charter , its owners notify the shipbroking firm with which they do business that they have a vessel that will reach a certain port of the world at a specified date , and that the vessel will then be available for chartering . The owners describe the character of the vessel in so far as that may be necessary , and state the kind of services for which the vessel is best adapted . If freight is moving in large quantities , this firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the vessel as soon as the ship is available . If , however , the volume of freight moving is relatively light , the shipbrokers will probably not be able to find a cargo ; and , if such be the case , they will communicate by wire with the shipbrokers in other parts of their own country , and very probably with brokers in other countries . If there is no available outbound cargo to be gotten at the ports of the country where the ship discharges its inbound cargo , the vessel will be sent in ballast to the nearest point at
