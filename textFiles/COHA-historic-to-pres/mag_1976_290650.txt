Television 's Second Season got started before the disastrous First Season was fully under way , and it threatens to continue with premires into the Third Season , otherwise known as Reruns . <P> The Second Season may turn out to be memorable only because of a bench mark program , an offering against which all future shows must be measured . This is ALMOST ANYTHING GOES ( ABC , Saturday , 8 p.m . E.S.T. ) , beyond doubt the worst thing ever offered in prime time . What happens is that the producers go round to small towns and get up teams to compete against one another in a series of games and races that are cunningly devised to make the participants look like idiots-generally through the simple expedient of putting grease on one or more of the obstacles they are called to surmount . These revels are surrounded by a hokey Superbowl atmosphere-bands , cheerleaders , a team of " sportscasters " who " analyze " the action and conduct inane interviews with the participants . It is all awful , as attempts to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a number of other programs scrambling around down there in the pits with A.A.G. It is difficult , for example , to decide which is the worst new sitcom . For sheer witlessness , the nod should go to LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY , ( ABC , Tuesday , 8:30 p.m . E.S.T. ) , a spin-off from Happy Days , in which the title gals ( one can not bring oneself to use a more dignified term ) are employed in a Milwaukee brewery in the early 1960s-a situation about which we are for some reason supposed to feel nostalgia . Penny Marshall , who plays Laverne , has chosen not to characterize her role but to do an imitation of the inimitable Judy Holliday . <P> But hold . Norman Lear 's latest entries , though marginally more professional as productions , are more offensive . His newest target for simple patronization is fat people . THE DUMPLINGS ( NBC , Wednesday , 9:30 p.m . E.S.T. ) - do n't you just love the title ? - are chubby James Coco and padded Geraldine Brooks . They are the proprietors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to coo repulsively at each other and rub flab , while their slender customers express ironic wonder that these lard tubs are actually happier than they are . Gross . <P> In ONE DAY AT A TIME ( CBS , Tuesday , 9:30 p.m . E.S.T. ) , Lear makes the same mistake that the producers of the late Fay did . Instead of the humor inherent in the show 's situation-a formerly married woman 's adjustment to the single state-he has chosen to cram it with familiar sitcom gags . <P> POPI ( CBS , Tuesday , 8:30 p.m . E.S.T. ) may safely be ignored . It is the latest comedy about minorities-in this case Puerto Ricans-to argue that people respond to being discriminated against by becoming more lovable . <P> Astonishingly , Danny Thomas ' new show , THE PRACTICE ( NBC , Friday , 8:30 p.m . E.S.T. ) , should not be ignored . Thomas is your basic , crusty old family doctor , and , to be sure , he can not resist the occasional opportunity to show that he is more than a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny 's son is a Park Avenue practitioner whose sharp dress , smooth manner and cleverness about tax shelters drives the old boy to outrage . The gag writing , at least in the opening episode , is plentiful and sharp-up to Mary Tyler Moore standards .
