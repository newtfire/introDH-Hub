TOURIST AND PILGRIM a story by George P. Elliott As soon as Chaim was asleep , Sheila began . " You know I have n't asked anything for myself , Walter . You wanted to send your parents to Miami for the winter . They went to Miami . God knows they deserve a vacation while they can still enjoy it , after all they 've done for their children . They went . You wanted to come to Paris . Here we are . " Already he looked annoyed , and got up and began walking around the room . " Here we are , " he said , " not just me , you too . You act like T 'm putting something over . Here we are , Hy too , little good it 's doing him , but he 's here . This is the capital of civilization , honey , that 's why we 're here , this is it . You know that . You agreed . " " Agreed ! I loved the idea . I 'm so grateful to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time abroad . . . Bringing Hy was a mistake maybe . Notre Dame scared him . He does n't like the food , it 's too rich , it 's different . He 's only eight , he gets bored . Why do n't you take him to the circus ? You remember what June said , the Cirque d'Hiver is pretty good . He 'd like it . " " Why do n't we all go ? You too . I 'm willing . A person can sightsee just so many hours , then fun ! Sheila , please , come with us . " Six months before , Walter had bought  --  against Sheila 's wishes  --  five one-dollar tickets to the new Copyright ? 1988 by George P. Elliott state lottery and won $4,000 . The week after winning , he had bought $50 worth of tickets and won $3,000 more . Sheila had been so upset by his luck that he had promised never to gamble on the lottery again  --  a friendly game of poker with a quarter limit , sure ; the horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " she said , " I want you to take him , just the two of you , father and son , something special . For me , Walter ? Do it for me ? You know I have n't asked anything for myself , unless you count those ten visits to Dr. Rosenblum . " " Eleven . " " Eleven counting the first one where nothing happened ; get acquainted . " " It 's not that I mind , Sheila , you know that . " " I know that . " " But facts are facts . The check said two hundred and twenty dollars . That 's eleven . " " But it was n't for me personally , Walter . The lottery was too much , I felt a nervous breakdown coming on , he helped me . " " I know , honey , I know . I appreciate it . I 'm not blaming you . So tell me what you want . For me and Chaim to go to the circus together ? That 's it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy glasses , and a flexible , sensual , unsuspicious mouth . " Yes , " she said , and then made a long upper lip like a Puritan with ill-fitting false teeth . " No . That 's not just what I want . " She was gratified to see him beginning to get angry . He 'd warned ahead of time that from the moment they got on the ship in New York , he would refuse to quarrel ; and in fact the trip had been giving him such pleasure she could n't find it in her heart to let him know how unhappy she was feeling sometimes . Here in this little hotel room , she could n't forget the thin wall separating them from Chaim . They would have to keep their voices down . When he stopped pacing and turned on her , she realized she was still standing , and she sat on the edge of a straight chair . He liked to waggle his finger in her face when they argued ; but he could not do this satisfactorily unless he could bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she . There had been a quarrel when she did not give him the advantage by sitting , the one after his second lottery prize . It was not that she wanted to win that one ; she did not dare lose it . She had learned this sitting-standing business from watching her parents , and she was pretty sure Walter was no more aware of what she did than her father had been when her mother had done the same thing . Walter stopped , bent over her , shook his finger in her face , and looked as though he were about to shout ; she put her finger to her lips and he whispered instead . " What do you want ? Dr. Rosenblum told you ; always begin with what you want . Here you are in the middle of something already and you have n't said . " " I wish I 'd never mentioned he told me that . You use it against me . " " Does it work , doing what the doctor prescribed ? " " It works , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want ? To go to Temple ? " " In Paris , Walter ? Imagine saying , ' Bonjour ' to a rabbi . " They both giggled . " Anyway , " he said , " we wo n't hit any holy days . " " I appreciate that very very much . " For their trip , Walter had been careful to pick weeks during which they would be free from religious duties . " So , " he said , " what is it you want ? " " I want to go to Chartres . " He drew back a little . " Cathedral ? " " Of course . " " All right , we 'll go . Hy should see it . Maybe he 'll like it . " " Walter , I want to go alone . " He drew hack some more . " By yourself . " " After breakfast I take a train down . I go look . In the afternoon I take a train back . The desk clerk found out for me ; he telephoned in French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all meet back here , then we go eat dinner together . It 's not so awful . " " Go . I did n't know you 'd developed such a taste for churches , but if it 's churches you want , Chartres is the best . " " You saw it , honey , you said it was . " " It was . Even a dumb GI like me could see that . Now , Sheila , you know what I want , right now , this very minute ? I wo n't beat around the bush , I 'll tell you . 1 want to go to the Folies Bergere and I 'm going . " " Without me ? " " Sheila , do n't be silly . Hy wakes up and the baby-sitter talks French to him . That would be the last straw . " " So , Walter , nude women . I 'm surprised . " " Did I say I was going to stay all night ? I have n't gone to a dozen floor shows in my life . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor shows ? Beautiful costuming , beautiful stage sets , gorgeous dancers , first-class choreography . " " Nude shiksas . " " Am I prejudiced ? This is Paris . " " Walter , do n't you even want to know why I 'm going to Chartres ? " " Look , do me a favor . That doctor of yours gave you a good prescription . Follow directions . Take one before every meal and a double dose before going to bed . Do I ask people that want to sell me transistor radios why they want to sell them to me ? If a man says , ' Gutman , I want to buy your transistors , ' do I ask him why ? I buy , I sell . You want to go to Chartres ? It 's famous , it 's beautiful , it 's one of the high-water marks of civilization . I 've seen it , I do n't care how soon I see it again , not this trip , we only got two weeks . Hy wo n't like it , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So go . Now , " he said putting on his coat and hat , " I 'm going to the Folies Bergere . Do n't ask why ; I might tell you . " Because he was right , she did not argue any longer but stood in the middle of the room listening to him go down the steps , planning to lie on the bed and cry  --  into the pillow so as not to disturb George P. Elliott 's new collection of stories , " An Hour of Last Things , " to be published by Harper &; Row in May , will include " Tourist and Pilgrim . " Mr. Elliott is also a novelist , essayist , college teacher , and poet . Chaim  --  as soon as she heard the front . door slam . But as she waited , holding her glasses upright , a shaft in each hand , she noticed she was tapping them in a pleasant rhythm against her chest , and she realized she did not really want to cry , she was going to do it just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible about going to the Folies Berg'Ore anyway ? They were beautiful , sure , she 'd enjoy going herself some time maybe . Besides , he 'd told her he was going , that 's what mattered . Let him go in health , it was only to be expected , as long as he came home at night . After all , tomorrow she was going to du something much riskier than go to a girlie show , and she was n't even telling him . Who could say , maybe it was time they should have another child ; a boy , of course , preferably . Hy ( God forbid she should have such thoughts but there they were ) was a whiner . A mama 's boy , would n't stand up for himself , a disappointment even to his grandparents . Maybe when Walter came back from the Folies Bergere tonight , he would want to . If he did , she 'd let him . Was n't this their second honeymoon ? Chaim from the first one to Niagara Falls ; what did God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter deserved a little punishment for walking out on her  --  she would n't let him till tomorrow night at the earliest . She tiptoed in to see if Chaim was all right , and when she straightened the covers he flopped over onto his back , his face turned toward her . In the faint light from the other room she could make out his full , rosy lips , slightly parted . She could not help bending down and kissing them tenderly . His eyes did not open , but one hand rose as though of its own accord and patted her on the cheek . She turned her head so that she might kiss the soft , moist palm ; then she tiptoed out . " God forgive me , " she muttered , staring at herself in the mirror . " He 's so sweet , he 's so lovable , I love him so much . God forgive my thoughts no mother should have . I 'm an owl . " Her face was round ; the horn rims of her glasses were round and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck out like a beak . " All right , I 'm an owl , then I should be a good owl . " She sat down and began studying the book on Chartres Cathedral she had bought in New York ? had ridden bus and subway all the way in from 206th Street in Queens just to buy at Brentano 's . The best ; the clerk assured her it was the best there was ; he was a gray-haired man with rimless spectacles and a precise way of speaking that indicated he should know . She 'd only read the historical part at home  --  she had n't left the hook out where Walter would notice and ask questions tooa story by George P. Elliott 69 soon . Now she skipped the technical chapters on architecture , stained glass , and so on and so forth , and tried to get down to business : what things were supposed to mean , the Christian part . But the light was so dim and the writing was so dry that after three or four pages she put the book down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep : she was still awake , though she pretended to be asleep , when Walter came home . Her father 's parents had been killed in the Ukraine by the Tsar 's Cossacks . In Poland , her mother 's mother , and many cousins , aunts , and uncles , had been killed by the Nazis ; her mother 's father had survived the war and now was in a rest home in New Jersey , not in his right mind . She had been burn in Poland , and her parents had got out with her a month before Hitler invaded . They still lived in an apartment in the Bronx ; her mother kept the door locked three ways and took tranquilizers ; her father was all right , busy , made a halfway decent living driving a taxi . Walter 's family was luckier ; they 'd all got out of Austria in time . His brother Harold , however , when he was ten and they lived in Brooklyn , had been beaten up on the way home from school by some Irish boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been kicked so hard in the Adam 's apple that for the rest of his life when he talked he would croak like a frog . Not only that , he was full of fears . He still lived at home at thirty-two ; he had changed his name to Chaim and served as the shaman at the local synagogue , his only occupation ; he never went on dates . Unfortunately he not only sounded like a frog , he looked like one , and had always been timid enough ; so no one could tell for sure how important the heating had been . The Gutman family was not very religious , though of course both boys had gone to shul ; but Chaim was only content praying a great deal , puttering around the synagogue , looking after holy things . ( They had named little Hy after one of Sheila 's uncles she never saw , though just between themselves they knew they were really naming him after Walter 's brother . But Sheila had wanted it for a reason she kept to herself : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) One of Walter 's uncles had been killed by the British during Israel 's war of independence . As Sheila 's father put it , " He died like a man " ; as Chaim muttered ( just for her to overhear ) when she repeated this comment , " At least they let him die like a man . " At City College . all twenty-three of the students in her second-year German class were Jewish except for one Negro girl , and the professor was a priest ( then how could he be a teacher too ? ) . Father Stahl was thin , dark-haired , quick of gesture ; he smoked too much , and he had what was almost a tic of a way of tossing his hair back ; his nose was large and hooked ; he spoke English with an accent that reminded her a little of her grandfather in New Jersey . At first it froze her to be taught by a priest  --  not only a Christian , not only a Catholic , but a priest , and a German priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had taken German in the first place , especially the eight o'clock section , such a bad hour . Fate ? ) In a couple of months she was half in love with him , as were the other two girls in the class she 'd made friends with . He never said or did anything in the least flirtatious ; sometimes he would reminisce , in a voice at once sad and happy , about the great days of German literature . In the second semester a boy , a Communist of some sort , belligerent yet deferential , asked Father Stahl if it was true that Hitler had been a Catholic . Father Stahl gave him a keen look , which Sheila interpreted as meaning he understood very well what mischief the boy was up to but would take the question seriously anyway . For the rest of that class period he talked about anti-Semitism . Listening to him , Sheila told herself that everything he said was in books already  --  where else would he have gotten it ? But even as she was telling herself this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same again . Of course , by the next day she knew she just had a schoolgirl crush on him , and by the end of the term she was more glad than sorry to have to get a job and leave college , never to see him again . Yet she felt that she was in truth not the same as she had been . His arguments as such faded out of her mind ; they were full of theology , people and places she had never heard of . It was all the Christians ' fault . That is what she took with her . Anti-Semitism was invented by Christians . Nothing Jews did justified or even explained it , not really . Throughout history , the pure Jew-killing has been done by Christians and by totalitarians who were raised Christians . Otherwise it 's just neighbor-hating , which all men are good at , including Jews . Why else would Our Lord have commanded us to love our neighbors if it were not our nature to hate them ? Father Stahl did not in any way exonerate himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible words she ever heard uttered , uttered by him . Anti-Semitism is the worst crime in all the world , and Fathers of my Church devised it . She had little enough resistance to him , and less to what he said . No word ever thrilled her so much as his word devised : it slunk around in her mind for days , and as she lay in bed thinking of the wickedness of Christians , it would uncoil off her tongue in the dark . Her girlfriends , after that eventful hour , speculated on why he had ever become a priest and why he remained a priest now . Sheila decided in her own mind that The Church was holding him in captivity . ( By The Church , she meant a hodgepodge of which the main definable ingredients were Ivan Karamazov 's Grand Inquisitor , fat Irish bishops in Cadillacs , and nuns . ) She could tell by the pain in Father Stahl 's eyes and by the way he occasionally ran his forefinger under his collar that he wanted his freedom but that The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only Christian she had ever felt close to , and the one conversation ( in the hall after class , bluebook in hand ) she had with him began , " Sir , why did you only give me a C ? " and ended two minutes later , " Thanks anyway , I just wanted to know . " None of the Crucifixions or Annunciations or Last Suppers or Ascensions or Madonnas or Adorations she had seen in museums or art books meant anything special to her . She knew a picture could have special meaning . When she was a little girl first going to shul , studying Hebrew because she insisted she had to know it , her grandfather had given her a book of illustrated Bible stories , and one of the pictures had been of Jacob wrestling with the angel , at the foot of a ladder reaching up into a cloudburst of glory . ( She never got the story straight ; nothing of it remained with her but the picture . Imagine wrestling with an angel all night ! Does he think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angel did give up , what would Jacob do then ? It meant nothing to her that in the morning the angel gave Jacob a new name , some sort of funny symbolism ; she forgot it . Hy 's middle name was Jacob ; she never told why she wanted it , just said she liked the name ; fortunately Walter liked it too . ) Paradise Lost said nothing much to her , and she got bored with Dante halfway through The Inferno . The New Testament was better , but what did it tell her that meant anything she did n't already know ? Dostoevski , that anti-Semite , could be argued about , but not too much . What made him wonderful was his grasp of psychology , and since when did Christians have a monopoly on psychology ? The B-minor Mass shook her for a while ; it moved her even more than The Ninth Symphony or The Magic Flute , in fact , more than any other music . But then she thought , " How would 1 know it was Christian if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dei , qui tollis peccata mundr  --  they might as well be singing " Ein Vogelf linger bin ich ja " or " Freude , F'reude " for all she cared . " Joy , joy , " " A bird-catcher am I yes , " " Lamb of God , who taketh away the sins of the world " ? what a lot of nonsense . Yet here she was coming out of the Chartres train station in a light drizzle , huddling in her trench coat , her gray , helmet-shaped hat pulled down over her ears , going to see the most Christian thing she could find . She had been inside only two or three churches in New York , to musical events , and she had no special feeling for architecture , but she hoped and trusted she would find Chartres Cathedral beautiful . It really was magnificent , so if it left her cold , she herself would be at fault . What she wanted was to find it marvelous but meaningless , like Bach . A great artist could n't help it if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so many great artists had been Christians and so few of them Jews . But , as Father Stahl had said one day in class , why should the Dutch have had great painters for a couple of centuries and no great writers ever ? the Russians great dancers for a century and no great sculptors ? If only the Cathedral would turn out to be a beautiful place of warship built by an architect who just happened to be a Christian , then shea story by George P. Elliott 71 would be able to see Father Stahl , say , as a good man who just happened to be a Christian ; and she could go back to hating Christianity ( though of course not people who just happened to be Christians ) with a clear conscience , as she had not been able to for over ten years . Nobody else on the train had looked like a pilgrim . The man she saw going up the Cathedral steps ahead of her looked like an ordinary tourist , camera around his neck . Once inside , she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a holy place is this ? I am the pilgrim ? " By the time Walter came out of Chaim 's room from sitting by him while he fell asleep , Sheila was in her bathrobe rubbing cold cream onto her face . " So , honey , " he said , " we told you all about the circus and what we did , and you told us some of your little things  --  rain and sunshine , omelette for lunch , getting lost on the Metro coming back . What about the Cathedral ? Was it worth the trip ? " " I never saw anything like it , " she said in a matter-of-fact voice . " You said . " " It 's too much to talk about . " " Why so mysterious ? " He began undressing , unbuttoning his shirt , reaching inside it and scratching . " You 've been acting like a cathedral is something we should n't talk about in front of Hy . Well , he 's asleep . You can talk now . Please . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , right this minute , how could she begin by saying what she wanted ? She was all mixed up . She did n't want to think about Chartres . She did n't even know whether to put her hair up in curlers . In fact , she was n't even going to try ; she 'd just brush it . " It 's Christian . " The instant she said the word , she regretted it . " This is news 7 We should protect the baby from such a dangerous fact ? " " I do n't want to confuse him . " " He goes to Notre Dame and that 's all right , but he must n't even hear about Chartres . Sheila , you 've flipped . " " Maybe it was a mistake to take him to Notre Dame . " " Sure , he was bored . We might as well take him to the main public library and show him books in French . " " What I mean is , Notre Dame is just a big church like any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally , and symbols , and so forth and so on , and Christians use it . But it is n't Christian , the way Chartres is . You know what I mean ? " " Keep on talking , " he said . " Maybe I 'll catch on . " She looked at him gratefully . He could be so patient with her at important times , like now , He was n't pretending to understand the little woman , the way Irving could make June cry sometimes by pretending to understand her when she got all wound up in something . He patted her shoulder . " Tell me , what , was the main thing ? The windows ? " " No , " she said . " When the sun came out , they were wonderful , I 'm not denying it . But I expected them to be , everybody talks about them . It was the statues . " " Statues ? Of saints ? " " Do you realize , Walter , I never saw a really good statue in my life before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " in the Metropolitan Museum of Art they 've got lots of statues , even some medieval ones , from churches . " " Yes , but a museum . They 're just art in a museum . I mean great statues . How can you tell anybody ? Nobody told me . " " What about the Museum of Modern Art , out in the garden , all those wonderful statues ? " " Nude women ! Walter , all you got on your mind is nude women i " " Why not ? " he said . " Wipe your face so I can kiss my wife who is n't nude . " " Walter ! " She wiped . " There . " He kissed her . " Big fat nude women made out of lead . " " All right , honey , so tell me about your beautiful saints made of stone . " " Not beautiful . Yes , beautiful . 1 mean , they have real faces , worried , mean  --  they are n't all saints , plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what all kinds , every one has their on face , human . But still they are beautiful . Mostly they 're in those arches over the doors , going up , sort of streams of them going up , all alike if you do n't look at each one separately , like flames , like streams of flames going upwards , yet people . No one mentioned it . There are other statues too , but those going up over the doors are the ones that mean so much . " She felt on the verge of losing control . How had he got . her to talk about this when she had resolved not to ? He tended to he wishy-washy about Christianity . " Live and let live . " All right ! But would they live and let live ? No , they were monsters . How could it be that the worst people in the world should make such beautiful things ? Impossible to talk about it . Something was wrong . As she took off her bathrobe , she caught sight of herself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother had given her for the trip . It was supposed to disguise her dumpy figure and be alluring , leave her arms and legs bare . Her thighs in the mirror were fat and shapeless , and so was her short body which the frills and froth did n't do anything for really . Could a sleep-suit give her a waist ? make her bosom voluptuous ? It was only a glimpse that she caught , but she immediately snatched off her glasses so as not to be able to see herself again ; and she got into bed intending to lie with her back toward Walter . How could he love her , even under the blankets in the dark ? But just as she was settling herself he spoke . " All right , " he said musingly , " I understand a little bit maybe . I see what you mean about the statues , but I do n't understand the Christian part any better . I know I 'm not too smart about artistic matters , I only went to college one semester , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book on Chartres you study . So , honey , tell me , I want to know . " He was standing at the foot of the bed , looking at her , his pajama top in hand , too far away for her to make out the expression on his face , but from his voice she was pretty sure he was serious . She decided not to lie with her back to him after all . Was n't he putting on weight himself ? His stomach was n't disgraceful yet , but if he did n't watch it he was going to be in trouble before long , a bay window like his father . It was n't his fault , really , that she 'd said more than she should have . Now she was started , it would be rude to quit just like that , bang . " It 's so complicated , Walter , I 'm not even clear in my own mind . " She told him generally what she had gone to Chartres hoping to find , but even as she was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Not that Father Stahl meant anything to her any longer  --  God forbid , a married woman and a mother , and him a priest ! But it would be the easiest way to explain to Walter if she could mention her schoolgirl crush . Walter unfortunately had shown signs of jealousy ; he might not see it in the right light . Besides , suppose he did n't understand even after she told him this secret ? What would she do then ? Now , somehow , not noticing , she had got onto heaven , Christian heaven and Jewish heaven . What did she care about heaven ? She did n't even believe in it , though of course many did believe , Jews as well as Christians . Let them . What harm did it do ? Yet here she was talking about heaven , the face of God , Elijah , eternity . " Good lord ! " Walter interrupted her without warning . He pulled down the covers and turned off the light . " Why did n't somebody tell me nine years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " A Talmudic scholar , then ; he makes every comma mean something . " " It does , Walter ! " " To him , it does . " " In the Talmud it does ! Everything means something ! " " Pardon me , Rob Sheila . " He groaned . " By you every little comma means something . You 've got the glasses already ; where 's the long forked beard you should be wearing ? Why are you disguised as a woman ? " " Walter ! " Her outrage was all on the surface . When he called her " Reb Sheila " she felt a spurt of secret pride , and then a gush of gratitude to him . He got into bed and reached out to touch her . Before she could tell whether he only had it in mind to pat her in a friendly way , as he had done the night before when he got back from the Polies Bergere , she threw herself onto him . " Darling ! " she cried . " My angel ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she struggled on top of him . " Baby , my God , hey , not so loud ! What 's got into you ? Remember Hy . " She could hear the shock in his voice , and in a dim way she knew she would be just as shocked at herself if she stopped to think what she was doing  --  she had never done a sexy thing in her life . She pounded him with her fists and squeezed him with her elbows , she panted , she whispered hotly in his ear . Presently he fought back , and they strove without words , grunting , sweating . She did not yield for a moment , but he wrestled her over in a tangle of sheets and their night-clothes , and he kept her under no matter how she threshed and rolled her head back and forth and dug her nails into his sides and back , at the same time calling him her angel , her lover .
