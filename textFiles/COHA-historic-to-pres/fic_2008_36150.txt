Do your neighbors burn one another alive ? " was how Fraa Orolo began his conversation with Artisan Flec . <p> Embarrassment befell me . Embarrassment is something I can feel in my flesh , like a handful of sun-warmed mud clapped on my head . <p> " Do your shamans walk around on stilts ? " Fraa Orolo asked , reading from a leaf that , judging by its brownness , was at least five centuries old . Then he looked up and added helpfully , " You might call them pastors or witch doctors . " <p> The embarrassment had turned runny . It was horrifying my scalp along a spreading frontier . <p> " When a child gets sick , do you pray ? Sacrifice to a painted stick ? Or blame it on an old lady ? " <p> Now it was sheeting warm down my face , clogging my ears and sanding my eyes . I could barely hear Fraa Orolo 's questions : " Do you fancy you will see your dead dogs and cats in some sort of afterlife ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was an impressive word , so I 'd said yes . <p> He had heard that an artisan from extramuros had been allowed into the New Library to fix a rotted rafter that we could not reach with our ladders ; it had only just been noticed , and we did n't have time to erect proper scaffolding before Apert . Orolo meant to interview that artisan , and he wanted me to write down what happened . <p> Through drizzly eyes , I looked at the leaf in front of me . It was as blank as my brain . I was failing . <p> But it was more important to take notes of what the artisan said . So far , nothing . When the interview had begun , he had been dragging an insufficiently sharp thing over a flat rock . Now he was just staring at Orolo . <p> " Has anyone you know ever been ritually mutilated because they were seen reading a book ? " <p> Artisan Flec closed his mouth for the first time in quite a while . I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something to say . I scratched at the edge of the leaf just to prove that my quill had not dried up . Fraa Orolo had gone quiet , and was looking at the artisan as if he were a new-found nebula in the eyepiece of a telescope . <p> Artisan Flec asked , " Why do n't you just speel in ? " <p> " Speel in , " Fraa Orolo repeated to me , a few times , as I was writing it down . <p> I spoke in bursts because I was trying to write and talk at the same time : " When I came  --  that is , before I was Collected  --  we  --  I mean , they  --  had a thing called a speely ? . ? . ? . ? We did n't say ' speel in '  --  we said ' cruise the speely . ' ? " Out of consideration for the artisan , I chose to speak in Fluccish , and so this staggering drunk of a sentence only sounded half as bad as if I 'd said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Moving picture , " Orolo guessed . He looked to the artisan , and switched to Fluccish . " We have guessed that ' to speel in ' means to partake of some moving picture praxis  --  what you would call technology  --  that prevails out there . " <p> " Moving picture , that 's a funny way to say it , " said the artisan . He stared out a window , as if it were a speely showing a historical documentary . He quivered with a silent laugh . <p> " It is Praxic Orth and so it sounds quaint to your ears , " Fraa Orolo admitted . <p> " Why do n't you just call it by its real name ? " <p> " Speeling in ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Because when Fraa Erasmas , here , came into the math ten years ago , it was called ' cruising the speely ' and when I came in almost thirty years ago we called it ' Farspark . ' The avout who live on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , would know it by some other name . I would not be able to talk to them . " <p> Artisan Flec had not taken in a word after Farspark . " Farspark is completely different ! " he said . " You ca n't watch Farspark content on a speely , you have to up-convert it and re-parse the format. ? . ? . ? . " <p> Fraa Orolo was as bored by that as the artisan was by talk of the Hundreders , and so conversation thudded to a stop long enough for me to scratch it down . My embarrassment had gone away without my noticing it , as with hiccups . Artisan Flec , believing that the conversation was finally over , turned to look at the scaffolding that his men had erected beneath the bad rafter . <p> " To answer your question , " Fraa Orolo began . <p> " What question ? " <p> " The one you posed just a minute ago  --  if I want to know what things are like extramuros , why do n't I just speel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artisan , a little confounded by the length of Fra Orolo 's attention span . I suffer from attention surplus disorder , Fraa Orolo liked to say , as if it were funny . <p> " First of all , " Fraa Orolo said , " we do n't have a speely-device . " <p> " Speely-device ? " <p> Waving his hand as if this would dispel clouds of linguistic confusion , Orolo said , " Whatever artifact you use to speel in . " <p> " If you have an old Farspark resonator , I could bring you a down-converter that 's been sitting in my junk pile  --  " <p> " We do n't have a Farspark resonator either , " said Fraa Orolo . <p> " Why do n't you just buy one ? " <p> This gave Orolo pause . I could sense a new set of embarrassing questions stacking up in his mind : " do you believe that we have money ? That the reason we are protected by the Scular Power is because we are sitting on a treasure hoard ? That our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Fraa Orolo mastered the urge . " Living as we do under the Cartasian Discipline , our only media are chalk , ink , and stone , " he said . " But there is another reason too . " <p> " Yeah , what is it ? " demanded Artisan Flec , very provoked by Fraa Orolo 's freakish habit of announcing what he was about to say instead of just coming out and saying it . <p> " It 's hard to explain , but , for me , just aiming a speely input device , or a Farspark chambre , or whatever you call it ? . ? . ? . " <p> <br> Continues ...
