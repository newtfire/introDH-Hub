THE HUMAN FACTOR by Graham Greene ; Simon &; Schuster ; 347 pages ; $9.95 <P> Novelist Granam Greene , 73 , is entering the 50th year of a charmed career . Since publication of The Man Within in 1929 , he has achieved critical and popular success . Among the English writers of Greene 's generation , only Evelyn Waugh was more skillful at moving a narrative with brief , dramatic scenes . Yet Greene 's contributions have had a wider influence . He administered to the spy thriller its most potent dose of modern disillusionment . As a Roman Catholic convert with an unblinking eye for guilt and evil , he gave the bulky 19th century Russian soul opera a fresh English tailoring . The trials of a " whisky priest " in The Power and the Glory are , perhaps , the prime example of such styling . <P> The Human Factor , Greene 's 22nd novel , combines the shadow world of spies and the games they play with a pervasive spiritual malaise . Secret codes and assassination by peanut-mold toxin entice the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the workmanship is superb-almost too good . At times the novel reads as if Greene had entered a Graham Greene write-alike contest . The principal character is British Intelligence Agent Maurice Castle-a surname that pointedly suggests the guarded and lonely aspects of both the man 's profession and character . The settings include the nondescript corridors and offices of " the firm , " interiors of London gentlemen 's clubs , a richly cluttered bookshop and the drab comforts of Castle 's semidetached house in suburban Berkhamsted . It is the town where Greene himself grew up , a schoolteacher 's son so bored that he played Russian roulette with his brother 's revolver . <P> Castle is one of Greene 's patented Manichaean depressives , those saintly sinners whose jobs ( crime , the priest hood , spying ) allow the author to compose variations on his favorite themes : the pervasiveness of evil and the saving graces of kindness , love and even disloyalty . For Greene , disloyalty to institutions that threaten his ideals of individualism and humanism is a privilege , if not a right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . In The Human Factor , a similar commitment to make one 's separate war has catastrophic consequences for Maurice Castle . Outwardly , he is shades of gray : a man of regular habits , careful with money and drink , competent at the office , where he specializes in Africa . The only striking thing about Castle is his wife Sarah . She is a black South African with a young son by a previous encounter . Castle met her while on assignment in the Republic , fell in love and promptly broke the Race Relations Act . With the help of a Communist friend , Castle and Sarah escaped the South African security police , fled to a nearby Portuguese colony and eventually to England .
