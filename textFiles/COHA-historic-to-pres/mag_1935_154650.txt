On behalf of the Senate 's lobby investigation , Senator Hugo La Fayette Black last week diligently plied a spade in his dirt pile , " big enough to keep 20 committees busy . " Almost equally diligent was Chairman O'Connor of the House Rules Committee , bent on a similar investigation . Some spadefuls they turned up : <P> With the aid of an order from President Roosevelt opening income tax returns to their inspection , Senate snoopers found that plump Vice President Fred S. Burroughs of Associated Gas &; Electric had a salary of $60,000 paid by one of plump Howard C. Hopson 's holding companies which in turn charged other companies in the system an aggregate of $150,000 a year for their respective shares of Mr. Burroughs ' services . <P> A representative of New York State 's Public Service Commission testified that he had found that Mr. Hopson 's personal holding company had milked the system of $2,800,000 in profits during 1929-33 . <P> Roly-poly Mr. Burroughs , who swore that he did not know the whereabouts of his boss , roly-poly Mr. Hopson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate setup . " I ca n't any more tell you the corporate organization of all the companies than you can tell me the corporate set-up of the alphabetical agencies of the Government . " <P> Bernard B. Robinson , lobbyist of A. G. &; E .. testified that he had talked with Mr. Hopson by telephone four days earlier but did not known his whereabouts . " Mr. Hopson is not a well man . I 've been told by physicians that if he ever developed a sore throat he would choke to death . " " If you knew where he was would you tell the committee ? " " Well . I do n't believe I would . " " Then we will ask you . Do you know where he is ? " " No . I do not . " <P> Alarmed by Mr. Hopson 's illness , * Senator Black asked the Department of Justice to serve a subpoena on him in Manhattan . A deputy marshal failed to find him . Not surprised by the Senate 's failure was Judge John E. Mack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For six months Judge Mack has been trying , with a notable lack of success , to find Mr. Hopson . At Albany last week he quoted from The Scarlet Pimpernel on Runaway Hopson : They seek him here , they seek him there . <P> Those Frenchies seek him everywhere . <P> Is he in heaven ? Is he in hell ? That damned elusive Pimpernel ! Smiled Judge Mack : " The Scarlet Pimpernel has n't a damned thing on Hopson ! " <P> Senate investigators reported that A. G. &; E. 's admitted expenditures of $700,000 to defeat the Public Utility Bill were $92,000 short of the mark . Among those reported to have had A. G. &; E. retainers : the law firms of Patrick J. Hurley , Herbert Hoover 's Secretary of War , and of Basil O'Connor , onetime partner of Franklin D. Roosevelt and brother of House Rules Chairman John J. O'Connor , each $25,000.
