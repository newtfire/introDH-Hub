From Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall went an order calling attention to a IOOI regulation that forbids sale of hard liquor on military reservations , an all-but-forgotten rule . Prevailing practice in most officers ' clubs and messes* is for stewards to purchase liquor in the name of officer-members , earmark bottles for an officer 's personal use . Some clubs had grown lax in recent years , allowed unrestricted bar sales . <P> Dry Governor Leon C. Phillips of dry Oklahoma finally entered a protest to General Marshall against the earmarking practice . He was not quite on solid ground . But General Marshall did decide that the open bar must go . By his order , he deprived prohibitionists of ammunition and still left unblighted the camaraderie of officers ' clubs . All bar sales were halted , but the practice of earmarking was unaffected . <P> <P> * Enlisted men can purchase only 3.2% beer on Army property .
