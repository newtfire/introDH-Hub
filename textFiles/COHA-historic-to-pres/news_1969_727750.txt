All but four of City College 's ' 27 academic chairmen resigned their chairmanships yesterday in a gesture of support for Dr. Buell G. Gallagher , the college 's president , who submitted his resignation to the Board of Higher Education on Monday . Dr , Gallagher declared in a letter to the board that he was leaving because city and state cuts in the City University budget would make it impossible for the institution to admit a freshman class in September and would force other drastic curtailments . In Albany , meanwhile , Governor Rockefeller 's office announced that the state had eliminated the old ceiling on expenditures by the City University and would now match ? ' dollar for dollar ? whatever // 23 Resign as C.C.M.17 . Department Heads to Rack Gallagher 's ProtestContinued From Page 1 , Col. 1 New York City spent for the senior colleges of the university system . Under the old procedure , the state set an expenditure limit on the university . The city could obtain matching funds up to this limit but not beyond it . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it wished in obtaining matching funds for the university . As the Governor 's office noted , this procedure " clearly establishes that the level of the City University 's budget will be determined by New York City and not by the state . " . The 23 departmental chairmen supported Dr. Gallagher in a one-sentence joint statement in which they said : " Understanding fully the inadequacy or the proposed budget for C.U.N.Y. in 1969-70 to fulfill the university 's educational and social mission , and sharing President Buell G. Gallagher 's recognition that the university can not function under this budget , we the undersigned chairmen of the academic departments at City College herewith tender our resignations as chairmen unless a budget adequate to the functioning and development of the City University is provided . " College officials said the four academic chairmen who did not sign the statement of resignation could not be reached by those promulgating it . Department chairmen at City College do not receive additional pay for performing the administrative functions required of the posts . They teach fewer courses , however . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairmen bore no effective date , leaving open the possibility that if adequate budgetary provisions were made for the 165,000-student City University during the next few weeks , the resignations would be withdrawn . Mayor Lindsay said he could " understand " Dr. Gallagher 's concern about the fate of the university . " I share that concern , " the Mayor said . " But I do n't think this is the time to abandon the urban fight . " At the root of the university 's problem is its contention that the city plans to reduce its budgetary allocation to a point where its total state and city operating money would be reduced from $205-million this year to $180-million for fiscal 1969-70 . The state has allocated $99.3-million for the university but the City Budget Bureau has fixed no allotment yet .

" " There is a very considerable stir among the faculty and the students , " he said . On other City University campuses , however , the stir was less visible , partly , according to university officials , because the spring vacation was beginning and many students , teachers and administrators were leaving the campuses . There were no reports of resignations at the eight other senior colleges and six community colleges in the university . Said the head of one unilersity branch : " We 're all pretty desperate about how we 're going to operate . I ask myself the question everyday about resigning .

Bowker , the chancellor of the City University , sent a letter to Mayor Lindsay and City Council leaders urging them to except the City University from the delay in presentation of the over-all city budget . Dr. Bowlcer explained that thousands of applicants were being forced to wait far into the spring for word on their college applications because of the delay . A spokesman for the City Budget Bureau said that the Mayor " has instructed " Budget Director Frederick O'R . Hayes " to give this matter his fullest attention . " " The , administration is hopeful that an early solution can be reached to meet the problem of restrictions on next year 's freshman class and to avoid inordinate delays in notifying applicants , " the spokesman said .
