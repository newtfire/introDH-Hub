ON A TIMELESS North Dakota Sunday under whipped-cream clouds , I follow the Lewis and Clark Trail north from Bismarck , the state capital , and park on a bluff overlooking a broad , braided stretch of the Missouri River . Cottonwoods shimmer on the far shore , and a warm prairie wind ruffles the water . Upstream , I know , the river vanishes irretrievably behind Garrison Dam . But here it still looks very much the grand continental waterway that carried those early explorers through an almost unknown wilderness some 180 years ago . For weeks I 've been exploring that onetime wilderness , navigating by latitudes and longitudes of narrow roads over an incredibly tidy land . Vast wheat fields are stitched into the prairie like machine-made carpet . Regiments of sunflowers gaze so uniformly east that I 've felt compelled to glance that way too . Along the Red River , which flows north toward Hudson Bay , the state lies flat as a map , with grain elevators and solitary farms penciled on a razor-thin horizon . But heading west , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here was Little Yellowstone Park , where white-tailed deer roamed the delightful Sheyenne River Valley . Beyond , in rolling , glacier-formed hills , I found a sea of small lakes called potholes , where ducks , pelicans , and gulls share one of the most productive waterfowl hatcheries in the world . Small towns were islands of individuality in this agricultural archipelago , each with its siren billboard song . Hazelton enticed me with " 22 Friendly Business Places , " while Edgeley offered " Fine Food and Friendly People . " Gackle 's six churches welcomed me ecumenically . Kulm modestly proclaimed itself " Flax Center of the World . " I entered Napoleon between a pair of graveyards where neighbors lay separated by doctrine , if not by death , and found nearby a careful arrangement of 15 antique threshing machines that bowed rusty heads in memory of harvests past . Gradually I began to notice other patterns . In the towns , many stores and homes were empty . In the countryside I saw ma empty farmhouses , an ironic contrast : hundreds of silvery new grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panorama marched gleaming machines at work on one of the mightiest harvests in North Dakota 's history . A parade of trucks with red , white , and blue color schemes hauled grain to elevator , and on-farm storage bins that helped contain some 400 million bushels of wheat worth almost 1.5 billion dollars , in addition to 250 million bushels of barley , oats , and corn and 800,000 tons of sunflower seeds BUT THIS ENORMOUS productivity la : like an invisible blight upon the land United States agriculture exports hac tumbled almost 40 percent in five years as Europe , Australia , Canada , and Argentina competed in a world market glutted with food . Even India had begun exporting wheat . North Dakota 's 33,000 farmers had plunged some 5.7 billion dollars in debt . Now 17 percent of them were delinquent in mortgage payments , and as many as 5,000 were expected to be out of business before the state centennial in 1989 . In a state of only 685,000 people , where half of all workers depend on farming , it was a bleak harvest indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of acres of fragile prairie had been set to the plow . Drainage of potholes to create more farmland had caused increasingly destructive flooding and brought a catastrophic decline in the annual hatch of wild ducks . " The boom came when the Russian harvest failed in the early seventies , " I was told by farmer Bruce E. Viker , who with his brother , Dewel , produces wheat , barley , sunflowers , and sugar beets on 5,000 familyowned acres in the Red River Valley near Hillsboro . " Wheat went from $1.70 to $5.96 a bushel . An acre of land jumped from $300 to $1,500 and $1,700 . Now we 've gone from six-dollar wheat and $15,000 tractors to three-dollar wheat and $45,000 tractors , and you ca n't sell an acre of land for $900 . " He showed me four brand-new Duetz-@#  | Allis " Gleaner " combines that the brothers recently purchased , bringing their total equipment investment to about $900,000 . Two 25,000-bushel aeration bins with powerful electric fans ran constantly , drying grain that had been harvested with too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your meter spin , " said Mr. Viker . " But it gives us better control over variables like weather . The traditional way to harvest is swathing -- cutting the grain , letting it dry in the field , then threshing it . That protects your crop from being knocked down by harvestseason thunderstorms and hail . But damp weather will make the wheat sprout on the ground , which can cost you a dollar a bushel , or sometimes your whole crop . " When I met them , the Vikers had some 200,000 bushels of wheat and barley in storage on the farm , with room for about 150,000 more . Their farm was a model of meticulous order . By contrast , the economics of agriculture seemed an incomprehensible mess . For years the federal government had guaranteed minimum prices for wheat and other grains , with additional " deficiency "  | subsidies that gave individual farmers up to $50,000 more income a year . In 1985 Congress raised these deficiency payments to a level that would cost taxpayers some 25 billion dollars in 1986 . In the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average personal income by 13.4 percent ? the highest increase in the country . Now , there were rising complaints that only large farms benefited . And there were signs of abuse . Some farms were being split into smaller units , each eligible for a $50,000 payment . While wheat farmers in North Dakota had agreed to take 30 percent of their acreage out of production to qualify for subsidies , in 1984 they had planted 765,000 of these " withdrawn " acres in barley , oats , and other grains , already in huge surplus . Nationwide , over 6 million acres were similarly overplanted . It was not the first time that massive government programs had affected North Dakota . The Vikers ' land once was part of the 63,000-acre Grandin Farm , one of many socalled bonanza farms assembled by speculators in North Dakota during the 1870s from government land granted to the Northern Pacific Railway . The company sent agents throughout northern Europe to recruit settlers and sold them land for $2.50 an acre when they arrived . By 1890 , according to state historian laureate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , and 125 banks . By 1915 population had risen to 637,000 , and there were 75,000 farms , most of them planted to wheat . " But big merchants and bankers in Minnesota came to dominate the state 's economy . Many homesteaders were forced out because they could n't get a fair price for their crop , " I was told by Larry Remele , of the State Historical Society in Bismarck . " That early farm crisis stirred up a wave of populist politics . In 1919 a farmers ' legislature fought the outside control by setting up a state grain elevator and flour mill and founding the Bank of North Dakota , the nation 's only stateowned bank . Drought and low market prices forced many more farmers out in the 1930s . Since then we 've lost many of our small towns . And the average farm size has grown from 375 acres to about 1,200 acres . But the population has n't changed much since 1915 . " BISMARCK SEEMS TO ME the quintessential American hometown . I vividly remember the annual Folkfest Parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet of restored 1930s and 1940s cars , while World War II airplanes like the B-17 , B-25 , and the F4U Corsair thundered overhead as part of an air show at the local airport . High-school marching bands provided counterpoint to the basso profundo rhythms of an old steam tractor , and floats sponsored by two large downtown hospitals called Medcenter One and St. Alexius seemed like advertisements for television shows engaged in a ratings war . I discovered that Bismarck has German flavors to match its name . At the Bakers Dozen , I found Kneifla , a cream soup with @#  | chunks of dough . At Keichla Korner , a German fast-food cafe , Judy Rivinius introduced me to a dish called Fleisch Keichla , deep-fried dough filled with spiced meat . We theorized that this might have been the origin of the hamburger . Bismarck owes much of its ethnic flavor to German settlers , many of whom came there from Russia , descendants of those who had colonized the Black Sea region in the early 1800s at the invitation of Tsar Alexander I. Rising Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States in the late 1800s and early 1900s , and most of them settled the state 's central and southern regions . One of their descendants is Dr. Armand Bauer , soil scientist at the Department of Agriculture 's Northern Great Plains Research Center at Mandan . Dr. Bauer was born at Zeeland , where his paternal grandfather , from the Crimea , homesteaded in 1884 . He came to Mandan from North Dakota State University at Fargo in 1976 to do a long-term study on the effects of farming methods on soil quality . Traditional ways , it seemed , had taken a serious toll. * " Wind erosion of heavily cultivated topsoil is a principal cause of damage , " Dr. Bauer told me . " So far our soil tests indicate an average loss of 59 pounds of organic nitrogen an acre over 25 years . To replace it with commercial fertilizer would cost about $220 an acre . That 's about 40 percent of the value of all land sold in the state in 1981 . " In addition , four to five million acres of grassland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plow in the past seven or eight years in North and South Dakota , Montana , and Colorado . It was partly to get more subsidies but also speculative , for the added value of plowland . " Today , he told me , many of North Dakota 's farmers are switching to " no-till " @#  | techniques , in which herbicides are used instead of repeated cultivation to eliminate weeds . New seeds are planted directly in the stubble of last year 's crop . " This method can reduce wind erosion losses by 50 percent . Just as important , it reduces evaporation of soil moisture . A twoinch stubble keeps the equivalent of 2.4 inches of rain from evaporating . The stubble traps snow that would otherwise blow away , providing an additional 1.5 inches of water . In a semi-arid climate like ours , that 's like increasing annual rainfall as much as 25 percent . And there 's another benefit ? the snow cover keeps the ground warmer and makes it less risky to plant winter wheat . " The idea is n't new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the @# @# 1920s and early ' 40s , but then the big iron ' came along ? the huge tractors that let them plow every shred of vegetation under . They developed what I call the clean surface syndrome ' and laughed at the Peter Tumbledown look of conservation tillage . But now there are almost one million acres under no-till cultivation in North Dakota alone , and there will be a great deal more when farmers can afford to invest in the special machinery required . " In downtown Fargo a heroic sculpture'of a plowman and his oxen commemorates the settlers who first broke the soil of the Red River Valley . Most of them were Norwegians who came to North Dakota from settlements in Minnesota and Wisconsin . One of their kinsmen is Howard Dahl , 37 , whose Norwegian ancestors homesteaded near @#  | Fargo in 1882 . His grandfather , Edward G. Melroe , invented a windrow pickup attachment for combines that is still manufactured in North Dakota . Howard 's father , Eugene , was chief executive officer of Steiger Tractor in Fargo , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard is founder and president of Concord , Inc. , which manufactures a new no-till machine . I met him at the annual big-iron farmequipment show in West Fargo , amid gigantic eight-wheel tractors and air-conditioned combines that looked like vehicles designed to colonize another planet . The Concord machine was enveloped in the octopus-like tentacles of a pneumatic system that simultaneously applied fertilizer and two bands of seed to incisions made in the ground by sharp discs . Large wheels closed up the incisions , leaving the ground almost undisturbed . " We make a 20-foot seeder for $22,000 ? enough for the average North Dakota farm of 1,000 to 1,100 acres ? and a 40-footer for $48,000 , " Mr. Dahl told me . " But there 's a good return on investment . This system can decrease use of fertilizer by 20 percent compared to broadcast application . And since it does several jobs at once , farmers can save as much as 400 tractor hours a year . " One of Mr. Dahl 's clients is Mike Wyum , 36 , of Rutland . He and brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate farms totaling some 5,500 acres and switched to no-till cultivation in 1981 . " We had a very dry spring with high winds , and we were just watching our land blow away , " Mike Wyum told me . " Now  | we 've basically eliminated erosion . You ca n't take that savings to the bank right now , but we know the land will be there for our children . " THE WYUM FIELDS have produced another promising crop , according to U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service researcher Harold Duebbert of the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in Jamestown . In a two-year study performed with the help of the Wyums and 64 other landowners , Mr. Duebbert found that no-till winter wheat provided a good nesting ground for ducks , including blue-winged teal , pintail , mallard , gadwall , and shoveler . " Good news ? Yes ! We found one successful duck nest per hundred acres . That 's some of the best news about ducks in 20 years , " he told me . " Once people farmed around the wetlands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | farming has totally changed North Dakota 's landscape . Only about two million acres are left of the original five million acres of potholes . People say many of them are n't useful to ducks anyway , because they dry up in summer . But that drying cycle helps recycle nutrients critical for the production of protein-rich insects that nourish breeding ducks in the spring . " DRIVING SOUTH ONE DAY from Hurdsfield , I found myself sailing a sunset sea of potholes , surrounded by graceful hills alive with fall colors of the grasses . I realized then how an inelegant name ? pothole country ? obscures the unity of a region that covers large parts of Alberta , Saskatchewan , and Manitoba in Canada , as well as the north-central region of the United States . About half of all wild ducks in North America are produced in the prairie potholes . Two to three million are hatched in North Dakota . In 1961 , to protect this resource , the Fish and Wildlife Service began a program to buy outright 328,000 acres of wetlands and adjacent uplands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,250,000 acres to owners who agreed not to fill , burn , or drain their wetlands . In 1977 local politicians whipped up resentment against such federal " interference , " and the North Dakota legislature passed laws that made it almost impossible to acquire easements . After six years of legal battles , the U. S : Supreme Court overturned the ban . Even so , the Fish and Wildlife Service has been reluctant to get started again without the state 's consent . How crucial the problem has become I learned from Dale Henegar , North Dakota 's game and fish commissioner . " The autumn flight of ducks from North Dakota is expected to be down as much as 50 percent this year . In all the central flyway , it will be down by 30 percent . And this will get worse before it gets better . From 15,000 to 25 , 000 acres of potholes in the state are being lost each year on private land , which produces most of our waterfowl , even though state law requires a permit to drain potholes of 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss in wetlands area alone . Ducks are being forced to nest in ever shrinking islands of upland habitat , favoring predation . Red foxes alone kill about 900,000 mallard hens annually , in addition to their young . " We need bio-politicians today , not bioactivists , " Henegar told me . " We 're making a new effort to get farmers , wildlife people , and water 333  | interests together for joint action to save potholes . The Crystal Lake Water Management Project in Wells County , just north of Hurdsfield , is a good example . It includes seven square miles and a dozen landowners in some of North Dakota 's best pothole country . Wetland drainage was flooding farmers downstream , and the whole thing was headed for court . " I went to them and said , Let 's sit down and talk ? heal old wounds . ' " So we got agreement between all the people involved ? the State Water Commission , the Wells County Water Resource District , the federal wildlife people , and the North Dakota chapter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will buy some small parcels to develop as habitat and acquire perpetual easements for others , including restoration of some previously drained potholes . In return , local people will design some eight miles of new drainage channels to protect downstream land from spring flooding . " Our aim is n't to stop change . It 's to stop wildlife loss . " WHILE private wetlands have suffered the greatest damage , national controversy has centered on the Garrison Diversion Unit , an elaborate water project begun after the two-mile-wide Garrison Dam was completed across the Missouri in 1953 . Congress authorized the 1.2-billion-dollar project in 1965 to carry Missouri River water to irrigate some 250,000 acres on 1,200 North Dakota farms . Conservation groups protested that the cost , averaging 1.2 million dollars per farm , far outweighed the benefits , particularly since 220,000 additional acres would be required for roads , canals , reservoirs , and to mitigate damage to critical wildfowl nesting areas . Their arguments failed , and construction was well along when it was discovered that two proposed irrigation areas , on the north side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southeast , would have allowed Missouri River water to flow into Hudson Bay via the Souris and Red Rivers . Under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 , Canada refused to risk potential damage to its own fisheries and wildlife by Missouri biota . The international 338 furor prompted Congress to re-examine the project 's cost , environmental impact , and goals . In early 1986 the spending authorization was cut almost in half , irrigated land was limited to 130,000 acres in central and southeastern North Dakota , and project managers were ordered to restore or protect an acre of wetland for every-acre destroyed . A two-year feasibility study was ordered on a new canal and other irrigation facilities . More important to a majority of North Dakotans , the new legislation funded a 200-million-dollar project to provide potable water to some 130 towns and surrounding farm areas where groundwater has long been dangerously contaminated with natural salts , arsenic , and other chemicals . FOR YEARS North Dakota 's most often voiced justification for the Garrison Diversion irrigation scheme was that the Garrison Dam had forced the sacrifice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other states . Much of the land ? some 155,000 acres ? contained the farms and villages of Fort Berthold Indian Reservation , home of the Mandan , Hidatsa , and Arikara . The tribes received 12.6 million dollars for the land , for the loss of eight communities , and for the cost of relocating on upland prairie . " Money could n't replace what we lost , " I was told by Gerard Baker , a MandanHidatsa who serves as district ranger of the north unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park . " Before the dam we made a good living farming the bottomlands . Our society was intact . After our lands were flooded , communities were broken up and people relocated to land that was totally unsuitable for vegetable farming and livestock . The government built housing and promised there would be jobs on the reservation or in the white community . But there were never jobs enough even for whites . So people just sat in the houses . All sense of an extended family relationship was gone . The govern= ment gave them welfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baker has more reason than most to measure how much his people have lost . After earning degrees in criminology and sociology at Southern Oregon State College , he spent years organizing archaeological and @#  | cultural displays at Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site , about ten miles south of Garrison Dam . North Dakota 's first farmers had built a highly sophisticated culture there long before Lewis and Clark first encountered them in 1804 . " When I grew up , it seemed like learning to be an Indian was mostly learning how to fight , " Mr. Baker told me . " After that I went through a militant period . But when I started learning our history , I realized that without our own religion we 're lost . In the old days young men of the tribe went into the wilderness on vision quest . ' They stayed alone and fasted until they received a vision of their future . That is what we need today . " We go off to feed the park 's resident herd of tough , rangy longhorn cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aggressive pursuit of the grain sacks he carries . Later he pours a few handfuls of feed outside the storehouse door . " For my rabbits , " he says . " Our religion asks that we give something back to nature in thanks for everything we use ? the crops we grow and the birds and animals that share our world . For us the Spirit and the commonplace are one . If we lose that knowledge , we lose ourselves . " Mr. Baker 's clan name is Yellow Wolf , and he is brother to Eagle Woman , otherwise known as Mary Baker , 35 , vice president for academic affairs at the United Tribes Educational Technical Center at Bismarck . Some 300 students come there from 26 reservations in North Dakota and throughout the U. S. to earn certificates in such vocational skills as licensed practical nursing , medical record keeping , police science , and building and automotive trades .  | Among the students are 56 young couples whose children attend an on-campus nursery , day-care unit , or the center 's elementary school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , " Mary Baker told me . " We teach survival skills for the white world . But that does n't mean teaching them to become like whites . " Mary Baker became dean of Fort Berthold Community College in 1975 after earning a master 's degree in education at Penn State University . Now her goal is a doctorate in curriculum development , with emphasis on a realistic portrayal of Indian history and cultural values . " In white education Indians are always the losers . Either we 're portrayed as the bad guys or there 's too much noble savage ' nonsense . Each tribe is different , with its own history and tradition . We have our own rivalries and our own bad guys and good guys . It 's important that white teachers understand Indians without stereotyping them . " NORTH DAKOTA suffers its own stereotypes ? that it 's purely a farming state , for example . Along scenic  | Highway 200 south of Lake Sakakawea , I encountered the energy belt , where huge strip mines produce some 26 million tons of lignite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that export twothirds of their power to other states . To the west , hundreds of slow-flowing wells produce some 51 million barrels of oil a year . But falling oil prices have brought depression to oil towns like Dickinson and Williston , and higher quality Montana and Wyoming coal helps utilities there undercut North Dakota 's electricity prices . The most impressive energy site of all is the two-billion-dollar Great Plains Coal Gasification plant at Beulah , where underground lignite mines once supplied fuel for prairie dwellers who had no trees . The huge facility was conceived in the energy crisis of the early 1970s , when Washington analysts predicted that the United States was running out of natural gas . Now it produces about 135 million cubic feet of synthetic gas daily . The Department of Energy took over the plant in 1986 after the five energy companies that built it defaulted on a 1.6-billiondollar loan from taxpayers . To repay that loan , its output would have to sell at about  | ten dollars per thousand cubic feet ? five times higher than natural gas flowing from Williston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotype falls flat if you travel the northern border , where the Turtle Mountains rise abruptly as high as 2,500 feet . Hardwood forests shelter Lake Metigoshe State Park , and nearby lie the woodland trails and ceremonial vistas of the International Peace Garden , which spans the border to symbolize the long friendship of Canada and the United States . CLOSE TO THE SAME BORDER are less visible symbols of a nuclear age . Driving on a dirt road near Antler , I came on a chain-link fence surrounding what seemed to be a small parking lot in the midst of deserted countryside . I approached close enough to read a small sign warning intruders away . " Use of Deadly Force Authorized , " it said , and I realized I was trespassing on the site of an underground silo containing a U. S. Air Force Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile . The state shelters 300 such missiles , each capable of carrying three nuclear warheads . Together with B-1 and B-52 bombers at Strategic Air Command bases at Minot and Grand Forks , they give North Dakota one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aimed at the Soviet Union . It seemed ironic that part of the bountiful wheat harvest stored in North Dakota 's farm silos had been targeted on the Soviet Union as well ? at cut-rate prices that would subsidize a floundering Communist economy while undercutting the farm exports of Canada , not to mention other U. S. allies all over the world . Such problem-laden solutions to the farm crisis do n't always square with North Dakotans ' streak of prairie common sense . " We just ca n't save all the farmers , " I was told by Joe Lamb , president of the stateowned Bank of North Dakota . " But we have to take care of the good ones , because that 's where progress will come from . " Mr. Lamb is a small-town banker appointed in 1985 to effect a reorganization of the bank , which had to write off a staggering $8,328,000 in bad loans . " There are 177 banks in North Dakota , plus I do n't know how many savings and 342  | loan companies and credit unions , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans based on insufficient research , too much local boosterism . Local lenders mistakenly advanced money on inflated land values , on net worth that existed only on paper . They were trying for growth , but going too fast . Now there 's a world of hurt out there , and we 've all got to take our hit . " MR . LAMB 'S GRANDFATHER and granduncles founded the northern town of Michigan City in the 1880s . I remembered the town vividly because I 'd had three cups of coffee and a notable homemade date cookie in the Kite Cafe for 31 cents . How a business could survive at such prices I did n't know . But in many North Dakota communities I found that methods of survival have a similarly homegrown air . Driving south from Bismarck on Route 1804 , I stopped at the two-room Telfer School , where principal Patricia Stein , 42 , presides over grades one through five , while Montana-born Ann Beddow , 30 , teaches grades six , seven , and eight . Mrs. Stein attended a one-room school herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 students in all , " she told me . " Last year our fifth grade scored at highschool level on the National Iowa Basics Test . All of our kids are above average . They get along , help one another , there 's a lot of interaction between the age groups . We 're very much like a family . " The present Telfer School was combined from former school buildings number two and number three . School number one stands on the farm of Elvira Rogstad , whose son bought it at an auction when the district retrenched a few years ago . " I guess we 're kind of sentimental , " she told me . " All eight of my kids graduated from Telfer and so did I. It 's always been part of our heritage . At the school centennial in 1984 the oldest graduate at the celebration was 81 , and the youngest student was six . " Keeping the heritage going is n't easy . " We have 320 acres , and we raise horses , cows , ducks , chickens , wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked in her spotless farm kitchen . " But there 's no way we could make it on farming alone . My husband is a carpenter . Our sons rent land to farm , but one is studying architecture , two are ironworkers , one is a mechanic , and one sells farm implements . One daughter married a rancher , one deals blackjack at a casino in , Bismarck and works for a lawyer as well . The youngest is still in high school . " So far we 've been lucky ? everyone has managed to stay in North Dakota . " On another day , driving through the yellow clay canyons of Badlands country near the Montana border , I come to Marmarth , which seems to be an almost perfect ghost town , lost in a forest of cottonwoods  | on the banks of the Little Missouri River . I 'm badly mistaken . On one building a sign says " Mert 's Cafe , Good Food , Open 7 Days a Week . " Inside , proprietor Mary Ann Lecoe is presiding over Sunday smorgasbord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patti Perry , 40 . She fetches the town 's " family album , " which contains a panorama photograph of huge crowds and a multitude of steaming trains , shot during an anniversary celebration in 1919 . " Marmarth was a big cattle-shipping station and division point of the Milwaukee Road , which had a roundhouse , maintenance yard , and a large bunkhouse for crews . The Milwaukee went broke running too many tracks to too many small towns . Burlington Northern took over and closed everything down in 1982 . But there are still 180 of us living here . The school still operates , and the volunteer fire department too . We 're working to make Marmarth a real railway museum . Burlington has given us the bunkhouse , and we 'll get first option on sale of other railway property . " She takes me on a walking tour of downtown , with its crumbling brick bank , old bars , and a hotel that had its last guest in 1970 . On Main Street I find the real treasure of Marmarth : the tiny Mystic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion-picture houses in the United States . Refurbished in 1976 by the Marrnarth Historical Society , it now is listed on the Department of the Interior 's National Register of Historic Places . " We use it every April for our annual variety show . Last time we did Ten Nights in a Barroom . ' We do n't need much heavy drama . Mostly ranching is all that 's left , and this year was a whole bunch of hoppers and damn little rain . But this is the greatest next year ' country in the world . If you come back , we 'll still be here . " ON A FLAGRANT prairie day when rain slashes through brilliant sunlight and a rainbow leaps across a vast black palisade of cloud , I find the city of Carson looking very much like a pot of municipal gold . New houses are going up , old ones getting painted , and the main street gleams with new Western-style buildings , complete with hitching posts , rough-cut siding , and covered sidewalks . This rural renaissance is the work of Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-founded a California-based company called LSI Logic , Inc. , which designs custom computer chips . Since then he has invested some 3.5 million dollars of silicongotten gains in his hometown . A new professional building houses the pharmacy , together with state and federal offices and the city hall . Nearby stand a new grocery store , a clothing store , and a family recreation center . " We had things like this when I was young , " Mr. Bohn told me . " I wanted the town to have that benefit again . Now others feel the same way . One man has come back to open a welding business . There 's a new beauty shop , a craft shop , and a garage . We 've even found a young doctor to reopen our medical clinic . " New jobs enable some Carson young people to stay . For those with wider aims , Mr. Bohn funds three college scholarships each year for top local students . " Small towns are n't necessarily for young people , " he said . " They want action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That sort of tenacity , I decided , may be North Dakota 's most abundant crop . I saw it expressed quite differently a few days later in a publicity photograph of scores of cheerful young men and women apparently sprouting from a golden wheat field near Fargo . They formed the entire staff of Great Plains Software , a company that produces a nationally marketed accounting program for small businesses . At its head was Douglas Burgum , company president , who had worked his way home to North Dakota via a business degree at Stanford University and a management career in Chicago . " I was the youngest of the youngest in my family ? so I had to go into another field than agriculture . I had to leave North Dakota to work , and I did n't like that .

Small-town @#  | values and high-tech education are not such a bad combination for the future . " Whatever that future brings , North Dakota will never let itself be taken for granted . It is still a part-time wilderness where tornadoes and hailstorms and drought can tip the most carefully computed balance sheet . And however domesticated the land might seem , hunters will take more than 50,000 deer and gun down myriad game birds as well , in a final crimson harvest of the year . I went to North Dakota last in winter , when the land shimmered like a mirage beneath a snowfall that seemed as wide as the earth but only inches high . Invisible beneath the snow were the young shoots of winter wheat , and I knew they would be measured in something more than bushels when their time was ripe .
