Piedra Alta , Colorado The patient known as Oliver was in the final stages . Gamma observed him through a square hole in the thick metal door . Duty required the guard to keep watching , even though he knew he 'd dream about it for weeks . He always did . Inside the windowless cinder block room , Oliver 's khaki pants were soaked with perspiration and other bodily excretions . He twisted against the leather straps that pinned him to the bed , clanking metal hooks against welded bolts , and chafing his wrists to the bleeding point . Oliver 's raw eyes , depleted of tears , scanned in terror for unseen attackers . His neck muscles strained into tight cords as he screamed in guttural yells . Kenneth Combs , Director of the Mirage project , elbowed the guard aside and peered through the small opening . Gamma could hear Oliver whimpering like a dog with a broken leg . Combs ran his hand over his bald head . His face betrayed no emotion as he studied the scene , then said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combs turned to leave , the guard said , " Sir . " His voice cracked slightly . Combs spun back and lasered his obsidian eyes into the man . Gamma looked down as he continued . " Based on some of the others , there may be a chance this patient- " " Did I ask your opinion ? " Gamma cleared his throat . " No sir . " " You 're aware there 's an inspection in two hours ? " " Yes sir . " Combs walked away and spoke without looking back . " Dispose of him in the usual way . " General James Weston sat in the back of a black Chevy sedan . His driver was dressed in civilian clothes so as not to attract attention . Asnowstorm whipped the car , oblivious to the pitiful efforts of the windshield wipers , and the wind whistled through an invisible seam somewhere in front . " I 'm sorry , General , " said the driver . " I ca n't see the turnoff in this weather . I 'll swing back around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and pulled off the heavy wool overcoat . The shirt of his uniform , now soaked with perspiration , clung to his skin . He looked out the window and could hardly see the aspen trees ' bare limbs through the hazy gauze of snow flurries . Focusing on his reflection in the window , Weston studied his features intently , hypnotized by the rhythmic squealing of the windshield wipers . It seemed to him that his wrinkles were even more deeply creased than usual , and he was surprised by the spiderwebs of red veins in his eyes . Having to deliver this news was n't helping . " Here it is , sir , " said the driver . The general was thrown against the door as the car turned sharply right . He could hear the chains on the tires crunch against the ice , and he felt the rear wheels fishtail . About two miles down a rough road , Weston saw antitank barriers-giant piles of rusted metal girders sticking out of the ground like rifles stacked in a teepee formation . They surrounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thick , bulletproof glass . Jutting across the road was a red and white striped pole , almost three feet in diameter . A sentry approached the car . When the driver lowered the window , a cold gust assaulted Weston . " Afternoon , General , " said the sentry with a salute . His mustache was laced with ice . " Afternoon . " " Sir , I 'm sorry , but security does n't allow your driver inside . We have a van to take you from here . " Weston hobbled out of the car , moving slowly to buy a little more time . The wind sounded like a huge bellows , and the sharp cold assaulted his skin as he climbed into the van . He dragged his overcoat behind him , leaving a rough trail in the snow . They drove several miles in silence , clearing two more checkpoints . The road finally led into the mouth of a man-made cave . A six-story cavern that was an abandoned NORAD site , meant to withstand nuclear attack . Overkill for the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The van stopped in an open area that was bathed in a wash of halogen lights . The rock walls , cold and damp as though weeping , did little to shelter the workers . " This way , General , " said a pleasant young woman in a heavy wool coat . Her breath was visible when she spoke . " I 'm called Dorothy here . " He followed behind her , aware of the icy echoes of his footsteps . Combs sat in his office , fighting to remain calm now that General Weston was on the premises . He ran his hand over his bald head , worrying whether the fuzz had grown visible since yesterday 's shaving . Then he began pacing across one of the few carpets in the facility . By reputation , Weston was a tough scrapper , which was necessary to champion a controversial project like Mirage . Maybe today 's visit meant he 'd gotten enough money to kick the research into high gear . Combs certainly hoped so . Their breakthrough in the last few days had opened a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General about it personally was an unexpected plum . He stood ramrod straight and examined himself in the mirror . His right shoe was scuffed on the side . There was no time to polish it , so he 'd stand with his left to the General . He straightened his tie an eighth of an inch and smoothed the sharp creases in his white shirt . Finally , he examined his beard , making sure it was evenly trimmed . Dorothy arrived with the General , and Combs rushed to greet him . The General lowered himself slowly into an armchair that barely contained his girth . " General , I 'm told you like two sugars , no milk , " said Combs , handing him a steaming coffee . " Your spies informed you correctly , " said Weston . He cupped his hands around the mug and blew across the top of the liquid . Then he sat back and took a sip . After an awkward silence , Combs spoke . " Sir , I want to be respectful of your time . Shall we start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Combs drummed his fingers behind his back . " Our biggest frustration is that we ca n't discuss what we 've achieved . I 'm looking forward to telling you everything . " Combs thought the General looked as if he were sitting on something uncomfortable . " Major Combs- " began the General . Combs whispered . " Sir , I 'm sorry , but here I 'm only called the Director . Even in my own office . The security- " " Yes , yes , sorry . Son , the problem is . . . well . . . " Weston grimaced , then took another sip of the coffee . " The problem is . . . I 've got to shut you down . " It took a beat for the words to register . When they did , Combs felt as if he had been punched in the solar plexus . He leaned against his desk for support . " Shut us down ? " " I 'm here to see that everything is dismantled by tomorrow at oh-eight-hundred . There 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel . All the documents have to be shredded by then . " " Sir , we 've had some astounding breakthroughs . Have you seen the reports ? " " Of course I 've seen the reports . The problem is Peterson , that bleeding-heart pinko senator from California . He got wind of what you 're doing up here . You 've got a Judas in your ranks , son . That 's the only way he could 've found out . " " We have a leak ? " " Yes sir . Peterson went to the Finance Committee and threatened to go public if the plug was n't pulled in forty-eight hours . " Combs 's belly felt like it was on fire . He mentally scanned the faces of his personnel , trying to divine the traitor . His voice was tight when he spoke . " There must be a way- " " There is n't . It 's over , son . You got to retreat when you 're licked . " The room seemed to swirl around Combs . The only sound was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You still divided into three sectors ? " Combs nodded . " Keep the divisions physically isolated . And only the top dogs do the shredding . " Weston pushed himself up , using the arms of the chair to support his large frame . " I 'll be here at oh-seven-hundred for a final walk-through . " " You mean we have to start now ? " " Right now . " Within an hour , the personnel had been ripped from their duties and assigned to packing . Combs walked the facility in a daze . The scene was like an animal carcass being picked apart by buzzards . His top men reduced to filling cardboard boxes with years of research . Others wrapping lab equipment in tissue paper . Vans and buses parked outside , waiting like hearses . He almost lost it when they wheeled in the four shredders . One for each of his Section Chiefs . And one for Combs himself . The boxes of paperwork from each division were sent to three separate staging areas , where each Chief had to personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into his office . Strangers ! Waltzing right into his most private space ! Inconceivable . Just after 9:00 p.m. , Section Chief Delta sneaked away from his shredding and dialed the number . He knew that security prohibited outside calls , but since they were shutting everything down , fuck ' em . " Honey , I 've got to work late , " he whispered . " I wo n't be able to make it . " " Oh , no , " pouted Penny , the twenty-something ski instructor he 'd met when he fell down her slope . " I 'm leaving tomorrow for three weeks . " " Believe me , I 'm sorry . " " I bought a short nightie and some jasmine oil that 's supposed to heighten your sexual livid-or something like that . The store said it 's better than the oil from India . You remember the Indian oil ? " He remembered all right . That Indian oil had lit up his balls like Christmas bulbs . " If there is any possible way , I will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold if I 'm alone tonight , " she purred . " I 'm lying on the bed and reaching my hand into my panties . " It took all of Delta 's willpower to hang up and go back to the shredding . He had at least six more hours of ripping up this shit , by which time Penny would be ice cold and he 'd have blue-balls . How could they give a menial shredding job to someone of his rank ? Hell , the way things were divided up , no one could make heads or tails out of this crap anyway . So why did it have to be him ? Did he accidentally piss off Combs or something ? Combs sat with his companion , Jack Daniel 's . Although he rarely drank , tonight he was halfway through the bottle and finally getting numb . It was the warmest he 'd ever felt inside this Ali Baba cave . The most confidential materials were locked in his office . Since Combs was the only one who had access , he was the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four hours since they 'd brought in the shredder , yet he had n't been able to start . He poured himself another shot , and threw it down the back of his throat . Then he stood up and found himself wobbly . Combs stumbled over to the shredder , pushed the green button , and the machine whirred to life . After fishing out his three-sided key , he unlocked the file cabinet and took out the oldest folder . As he walked toward the shredder , he felt as though he were about to violate a sacred oath . Combs stopped and looked through the file . The very first experiment . He smiled at the na ? vet ? it reflected . Especially compared to where they were now . The rage began to build again . He 'd hoped the booze would lower the flames , yet his anger seared right through . Those sonsofbitches . They did n't even bother to find out where he was before they pulled the gallows trapdoor . Combs stood in place a long while before putting the folder into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt as though his skin was being flayed . He sat down for another shot of advice from Jack , who told him that he had to get through this . No one else could see the material . Wait . No one else could see the material . The germ of an idea took hold and started to grow . He was the only one with the whole picture . And while the research and data were voluminous , the conclusions were relatively simple . No one could shred what was in Combs 's head , and once he destroyed these documents , no one could even get that . He began to smile . Combs grabbed an armload of files and whistled as he fed them into the shredder . Delta 's fingers were slick and greasy from shoveling printed pages into the machine . The image of Penny fondling herself kept replaying in his head , and the piles of documents did n't look any smaller . He was already cramming in such large batches that the shredder had jammed four times in the last half hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine 's blades and walked into the hall to work off some of his frustration . Delta strode down the corridor in long steps , his fingers fidgeting for lack of a cigarette . The place was buzzing with people in white jumpsuits loading pallets of equipment . He glanced into the open door of a lab and saw Private Green neatly laying out his equipment on a workbench . The man handled each piece like it was a newborn infant . He remembered Green as one of those geeky types who always had his nose in a book . The kind that worked late even when there was n't any overtime pay . Delta stepped inside and sidled up next to Green . Green smiled , proud of his work . This guy would be perfect . " Green , come with me a minute . " " Sir , I ca n't leave the lab . " " It 's okay . I 'm giving you an order . " Green glanced around the room , looking for a rescuer . " I 'm not supposed- " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yessir . " Green trailed reluctantly behind Delta to the shredding room . Green stopped at the door . " This is a classified area . My clearance does n't permit- " Delta put his arm around Green 's shoulder and dragged him along . " You 're with me . And I 'm giving you permission . " Green resisted , like a stubborn horse being pulled from a barn . " I 'm redeploying you , Green . From now on , you shred these materials . " " I 'm supposed to pack up the lab . " " You the only one in the lab ? " " No . . . " " Then start shredding . " " I do n't think I can do that without the Director's- " " Fuck the Director . All the rules went out the window when they decided to shut down this Roach Motel . " " I still have two years to go in the Army , sir , and- " Delta leaned in close . " Look , Private . Lemme give you a real-life lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can put something in your record about insubordination . Or you can take care of this shredding and nobody will know but us . " Delta was bluffing of course . He did n't even know Green 's real name . " Sir , with all respect- " Delta whispered conspiratorially . " Kid , you got ta learn how to grab opportunities when they drop in your lap . Shredding is a helluva lot easier than packing up lab equipment . And a lot less dangerous than some of those chemicals . " Green hesitated . " I do n't know . . . " " I got a hundred dollar bill in my pocket that says you make the right decision . Think , kid . A hundred dollars , or a demerit . " " Colonel Delta , I do n't think it 's right to accept money . If this is important to you , I 'll take care of it . " Delta grinned . What a sucker . " Atta boy . Now I owe you one . See how it works ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled on his coat . " Do n't you read any of this shit , you hear ? " He slapped Green on the back , then left with his mind and groin already soaking in jasmine oil . For the next two hours , Green fed papers into the ravenous shredder , which gnashed its teeth as if calling for more . Just to change the monotonous routine , he went to the opposite side of the room and grabbed a handful from the boxes stacked there . On his way back to the shredder , his eye caught the heading on one of the pages . He looked around to be sure no one was near , then closed the door and began reading . Green found himself involuntarily shaking his head , as if to deny what was on the paper . Still stunned , he locked the door and continued reading through the files . This was absurd . No one would really do this . It must be one of those diversionary operations , where they pretend something happened just to confuse the enemy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings actually do something like this ?
