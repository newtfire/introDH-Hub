Some 5000 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science spent the week in Manhattan , at their annual winter convention . Some data : <P> Preserved Sloth . Perhaps 1,000,000 years ago , certainly 500,000 , a dumpy , pale yellow ground sloth , 8 feet long from its small head to its thick tail , lumbered terrorized near what is now El Paso , Texas . Some predatory beast was chasing it , perhaps a sabre-toothed tiger . The sloth was a plant-eating animal with soft teeth and did not know how to fight . So it could only lope towards a hole it knew . It reached the hole , scrambled over the ledge , fell 100 feet to the bottom . Bats who mat&gt; the place their perch fluttered and squeaked fearfully , angrily . The preying beast went away . But the sloth could not climb out of the hole , which was a volcanic pit with vertical sides . Soon the sloth died and the indifferent bats dropped their guano on its dead body . Good for modern paleontology was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tendons , hide and even a food ball in its stomach . Recently one Ewing Waterhouse of El Paso descended the pit and found the remains , which forthwith went to Yale 's Peabody Museum . It is the third and best-preserved ground sloth known , reported Yale 's Richard Sivann Lull . <P> Synthetic Insulin . John J. Abel and H. Jensen of Johns Hopkins reported that they had reduced insulin ( hormone which controls the body 's sugar ) to crystals of relatively simple chemical content . In the crystals they found 3% sulphur , considerable nitrogen , five different ameno-acids . They are working to identify remaining insulin crystal constituents . When that is done they feel that they can make synthetic insulin much cheaper than the present animal product . Insulin is one of the four hormones so far isolated . Of the others : adrenalin , thyroxin and pituitrin . <P> Hot- &-Cold; Moon . One late afternoon when the Moon was early up , astronomers at Mt . Wilson observatory focused their 100-inch telescope on her and with a thermocouple found her heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water boils on earth at 212 F. ) While they were measuring , Earth passed between Sun and Moon , causing an eclipse . Moon 's temperature dropped to 196 below Zero . Less than an hour later the lunar temperature was 155 F. Edison Pettit and Seth Barnes Nicholson , who reported this , estimated that when no sunlight reaches the Moon , her temperature falls to 459 below Zero . <P> Genesis of Continents . Earth has a rind 2,000 miles thick , a core 4,000 miles in diameter . The core is a hot , viscous liquid , composed chiefly of iron and held within the mighty pressure of the rind . At times the central heat melts spots in the rind ; asthenoliths or blisters result 30 to 600 miles below Earth 's surface . The asthenoliths may be hundreds of miles wide , 10 to 20 miles thick . So theorized Leland Stanford 's Bailey Willis .
