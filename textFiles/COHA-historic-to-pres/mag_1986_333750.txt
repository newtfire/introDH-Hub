Once more blood flowed in a Paris street . Once again posters picturing suspected killers appeared in the City of Light . This time the victim was Georges Besse , 58 , president of France 's largest auto-manufacturing concern , state-owned Renault . Coming just two months after a wave of bombings in crowded commercial centers across Paris killed eleven and injured more than 160 , the shooting of Besse outside his home last week shocked and saddened the nation . On Friday 2,000 mourners , headed by President Francois Mitterrand and Premier Jacques Chirac , attended a funeral service for the slain executive at the Hotel des Invalides , the site of Napoleon 's tomb . <P> Besse 's murder took place as another terrorist drama unfolded in a West Berlin courtroom . Opening amid tight security , the trial of Palestinians Ahmed Hasi and Farouk Salameh brought forward evidence that the Syrian government was linked to the March bombing in West Berlin of the German-Arab Friendship Society offices , which left nine people injured . The trial provided a bizarre sideshow . Screaming and gesturing wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices , sounds and music " were being piped into his cell to make him confess . The frenzied defendant is the brother of Nezar Hindawi , a Jordanian who was convicted in London last month of trying to blow up an El Al airliner , allegedly with Syrian help . After the conviction , Britain broke off diplomatic relations with Syria . <P> Although it had no apparent connection to the Middle East 's brutal politics of terror and revenge , the murder of Besse was particularly chilling . A highly respected executive , Besse was beginning to improve loss-riddled Renault 's fortunes . He had had little involvement in politics and avoided the public spotlight , preferring instead to spend his free time tending the roses at his country home southwest of Paris . The businessman was just steps from his town house in Paris ' Montparnasse district last Monday night when two women emerged from the shadows . " It 's good , let 's go ! " one of them shouted . As horrified passersby looked on , she fired three shots from a 9-mm pistol at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , waving a gun at a stunned witness . " You have n't seen a thing . " Then , as the Renault chief lay sprawled on the sidewalk , fatally wounded in the head , chest and shoulder , the assailants fled . <P> Chirac immediately rushed to the scene when he learned of the shooting . Ringed by scores of club-wielding police , the Premier expressed shock at " this bestial assassination . " President Mitterrand , who was visiting the West African state of Burkina Faso , said France had " lost a No. 1 " in the death of Besse , and he declared that " all our forces must unite against terrorism , without flinching and without compromise . "
