Col. George E. Waring , Jr. , has declined the nomination for Controller on the Henry George ticket . Late last night Charles W. Dayton accepted the nomination for Controller tendered him by the Democracy of Thomas Jefferson , or George men . A telegram was received by the managers of the Citizens ' Union from Charles S. Fairchild- asking that Mr. Dayton 's name be placed on the Citizens ' Union ticket , and his own withdrawn , for Controller . There Is some opposition to this in the Citizens ' Union , and a meeting will be held to-day to take action on the substitution . With the name of Dayton on both tickets his election is considered certain by the friends of Mr. Dayton . Col. Waring 's letter , it is expected , will be filed at headquarters to-morrow after the last day allowed by law for withdrawals from all but the tickets nominated by petition . The committee will have the power until Oct. 18 to substitute the name of any other candidate they may select to fill the position . Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was generally understood that he was to remain in the race only until a candidate could be found who would fill all the requirements . It was thought that Col.

Waring to the Democracy of Thomas Jefferson is as follows : " Messrs . E. Lawson Purdy and John H.

I should have told you that I would not give up , for the sake of becoming the Controller of Greater New York , the hope of continuing to direct the operations of the Department of Street Cleaning , until the plans now in hand for its improvement shall have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed the writing of this letter in order that you might not be embarrassed by the legal requirement in filling the vacant place on your ticket . " Now that you are free to act I confidently trust that you will find a better man to aid you in your work . Respectfully yours , " GEORGE E. WARING , Jr . " A reply to Col. Waring 's letter was sent by Dr. Marion M. Miller , Secretary of the Campaign Committee . The letter is as follows : " The committee directs me to say that it regrets exceedingly that you do not feel that you are able to accept the nomination for the office of Controller . The nomination was tendered because of a popular demand that your valuable services should be retained by the city and the belief that you are peculiarly equipped to perform the duties of the office satisfactorily . " Your nomination was enthusiastically received , and if you had accepted it we feel sure It would have found general favor with the voters . Respectfully yours , " MARION M. MILLER , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who expected Col. Waring 's declination , have been trying to bring about a union of the Citizens ' LThion 's candidate , ex-Secretary Fairchild , and Mr. Dayton . They have been trying to induce Mr. Fairchild to withdraw and secure the substitution of Mr. Dayton 's name . Mr. Fairchild and Mr. Dayton are personal friends , and this is among the possibilities . Mr. Dayton , according to his friends , would be perfectly acceptable to the Citizens ' Union , and should Mr. Fairchild withdraw in his favor he would accept the nomination of both parties . All the Tickets Filed . The entire city and county tickets for the County of New York was filed yesterday at Police Headquarters by the George Party . But three Councilmen yet remain to be named , along with a few Assemblymen and Aldermen , whose petitions will be handed in to-day .

That I should ever be privileged to stead . upon a platform that means all for which my associates in the field of labor have been contending in the past eleven years , and that we should have again with us that great leader in whom rest the hopes , the inspiration ? and confidence of the workingmen of this great city , are matters which were far beyond my expectation , but the lessons learned in public duty from the example of Henry George forbid me to act upon my own opinions of the suitability of my nomination . I therefore accept the honor which you have conferred unon me . I heartily assent to every declaration in the platform of the Democracy of Thomas Jefferson as proclaimed at Cooper Union on Oct. 5. 18:17 , " In franchise matters the past history of this city has been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete control by the monopolists of all our street and other franchises . We . find this kind of government upheld by the greatest political bosses , the Republican and the Tammany machines , who do not want the citizens to have their rights , because that would stop all blackmail . We must save our city from the rule of Crofter and Platt , and the Metropolitan Street Railway and Third Avenue Companies for which they stand . Until we do . labor will never get its just dues , and still must work for starvation wages through long and unlawful hours and under petty tyrannical rules . The franchises to be given by the Municipal Assembly should be limited by the most stringent terms permitted by the charter . " Clinton Furbish of the sub-committee of the George Party said yesterday : " Delegations representing no less than twelve prominent cand ; dates on the Republican ticket have been in here asking for the indorsement of the George Party .
