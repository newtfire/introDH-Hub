Admitting a dislike for wprds like " complex " , and other pseudo-scientific expressions to give at least an air , of mystery to extremely commonplace thought , there are times when it is the right word . A complex represents something so ingrained that no outside facts or logical demonstrations can completely move it . The big armament complex or the anti-British complex , even the antiWall Street complex , are examples in point . But experienced Wall Street men suffer from an intellectual complex . A scientific analysii of " The Stock Market Barometer " published in Barron 's has pointed out that the stock market must , necessarily , know more than all its critics put together . Once stated , the truth is self-evident . But the market letters of brokers show that the intellectual complex is still undisturbed . This sort of critic states a-number of bear arguments ; like undeflated wages , Europe " weltering in a sea of paper money " , " farmers out of commission as purchasers of goods " , a bad outlook for winter wheat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . Where these are true they are obvious , and the market must have taken them into account . They were obvious when the bear market turned with the low points of both industrial and railroad averages last June . How often is it to be repeated that the market is acting not upon what is before our eyes today , but upon entirely different conditions which its aggregate intelligence foresees many months ahead ? This particular Wall Street authority , a highly conservative brokerage house whose name it would be unfair to give , offers a typical opinion in saying , " We think some prices that are now below production costs will advance while many others will decline " . Any attempt to predict a profitable advance in sonic groups of securities with a decline in others is not only the merest guessing but is guessing without an even-money chance of fulfillment . Except in rare individual instances , stocks go down together because the good stocks are sold to protect the bad . But note the fallacy in the quotation . If there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when once a thing is in existence the cost of its production has nothing whatever to do with the price . It does not follow that because corporations are producing at a loss , through wage cost or for other reasons , the prices of their securities must improve . They may conceivably go out of production altogether . Value is what the buyer will pay , so far as the stock market Is concerned , and that is true of any market , for anything . The bear factors which are here quoted were discounted in the bear market which terminated last summer . But the " conservative " Wall Street man 's intellectual complex prevents him from surrendering his pride of opinion . That intellectual vice has ruined more people than all other causes put together . Anybody with Wall Street experience has seen men who have lost everything and still retain their conviction that they were right and the market was wrong . It is a poor consolation and it is not even true . Necessarily , and inexorably , the market is always right . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with inexhaustible patience it was that of Debs ; but H. G. Wells makes nothing of our Presidents .
