Letters to The Times EMERY REVES.L . A. DU BRIDGE . Letters to The Times Federation Urged Rule by Legal Order Considered Solution of Global Insecurity The writer of the following letter is author of " A Democratic Manifesto " and of the recently published book , " The Anatomy of Peace . " To THE Eerrox OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The editorial in the April 24 issue of THE TIMES entitled " Iran and World Government " conveys such regrettable misunderstanding of the vital issue now under debate that it may be of public interest to clarify some of its statements . THE TIMES says that " we are a long way from the world government ' which former Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts advocated at The Associated Press luncheon . " How " long a way " we are froni world government it is impossible to tell . But it is certain that the distance to world government is exactly the same as the distance to peace . THE TIMES says that to propose world government is dangerous because the Soviet Union will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are merely creating two opposing blocs . Is this not precisely the situation existing today within the U. N. ? Is it not apparent that the nationalist power politics today pursued through the instrument of the U. N. have already divided the world into two opposing spheres ? Where there is no law and order , no established government , fear and mistrust and expediency guide human behavior . No Security Created The United Nations is a world society within which sovereignty continues to reside in the individual members of that society , and not in the society itself . The Charter does not attempt to establish a legal order beyond and above the sovereign nation-states . It sanctions the existing state of anarchy in international life . It does not and can not create security . And the Great Powers behave accordingly . They are afraid of each other , they must mistrust each other , they must expand , each must try to be stronger than the others . This situation is inevitably leading to another violent conflict , no matter how much we pray and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in persuading the great nations that war between them can be prevented only by their integration into a common legal order , is an entirely different question . But I believe we must at least try . THE TIMES calls us " idealistic . " Is it idealism to say that the United Nations is incapable of preventing the next war and that we are drifting toward a holocaust ? Why is it " idealism " to say that only a legal order backed by the overwhelming force of society can guarantee peace among men ? Should not the exact opposite of that outlook be called " idealism " ? to believe that a treaty between sovereign states can preserve peace between the signatories of that treaty ? It rather seems idealism to say  --  as THE TIMES says : " We just have to hope that the quality of this mercy will improve , which is at least the ostensible purpose of the United Nations . " THE TIMES also accuses those who are convinced that peace means legal order that " the first thing they do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. N. " This accusation entirely misses the point . The point is : Can the U. N. prevent war between the major sovereign powers in critical situations like 1914 or 1939 ? If it can be proved that the U. N. , as an institution , can be relied upon to solve peacefully conflicts which may arise between the Great Powers and to impose its will upon potential vi9jators of the established order , without provoking war , then " weakening faith in the U. N. " is indeed criminal . But if that faith is not justified , to weaken it is a public duty ! We are not debating a religious dogma but an eminently political , practical matter , which certainly can not be , solved by faith or lack of faith alone . Progress always brings with it the painful task of destroying faith in shibboleths , prejudices and superstitions . Christianity was established only through the destruction of faith in the pagan gods ; democracy came only after destruction of the faith in the divine rule of monarchs ; medical science became possible only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another questionable argument of THE TIMES editorial is that " progress , as the Western World has conceived and experienced it , has been a matter of building on what existed , not of throwing away and starting fresh . What exists is the United Nations . " It seems to me the Western World is rather famous for having started fresh  --  certainly it threw away something in 1.787 . In order to prevent rational thinking and progress , the United Nations is now advertised to the world as a new fetish , something we have got and must blindly worship . Of course " we have got it . " But we did not get it from some supernatural force about which we can do nothing  --  it is our own creation , it is the product of our own political thinking . The root of the evil is the Atlantic Charter . It was a tragedy that in the middle of the Second World War ( which was the incontrovertible proof of the total fallacy of the eighteenthcentury ideas in the industrial twentieth century ) our leaders again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After having witnessed the utter illusion , the deadly dangers of the principles of national self-determination , national sovereignty , upon which the order of 1919 was based , instead of proclaiming the new principles of the twentieth century universalism and the interdependence of nations  --  which alone can stop this fatal series of inter-national wars and open the gates to industrial progress , we have once again proclaimed in the Atlantic Charter that each of the artificial social units we call nations is entitled to its sovereign state , and that no legal order should be established integrating the peoples of the sovereign nation-states . As soon as the people were blinded again by the false principles and nationalistic passions revived in the Atlantic Charter , the die was cast , the course was inevitable . The Atlantic Charter led to Dumbarton Oaks , Dumbarton Oaks led to San Francisco . Is it not permissible to warn that this road will lead us with almost mathematical certainty to a third world war ? Foundation of Law There is no choice between " building on what we have " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , that peace is the regulation of human interdependence in society by law , by government , we must also recognize that today nothing exists on the world level that contains the seed of such an order . The foundation upon which we must build , what we really " have " is not the U. N. but Law , developed from the family to the nation-state , human society based on its everebroadening sovereign legal order which has integrated families in tribes , cities in provinces , feudal estates in kingdoms , kingdoms in nations . The next step is the integration of the nation-states in a world-wide legal order . This is the task . It is nothing new . It is the continuation of one long evolution . All the talk about first letting the U. N. become " stronger , " " proceeding from what we have , " is pure escapism , postponement of action , refusal to face facts . THE TIMES makes what seems to me a serious misstatement . It writes : " Members of the U. N. have surrendered one ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They have done nothing of the kind . First of all , " the right to make aggressive war " has never been an avowed attribute of sovereignty . Never was a war an " aggressive war " from the point of view of one 's own nation . Every war ever waged has been a ' Kellum Justum . " Every war has been a " defensive war . " Even Hitler was forced to tell his people that they had to defend themselves against Polish aggression . This whole debate about aggressive and defensive wars is based on a sophism which makes any solution of the problem impossible . But nc matter how one looks at it , the members of the U. N. when they ratified the Charter did nothing sovereign nations have not many times done , and they have quite certainly not surrendered their right to make war . They merely signed a treaty , which they have often done before . Peaceful Regulation Nobody wants to " scrap " the U. N What some of us believe deeply is that a league of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only a legal order can regulate human relations peacefully , that time is short and that enlightenment must be carried out quickly , as naturally nc legal order can be established against the will of the peoples or even without it . This does not mean " scrapping " the U. N. , just as it does not mean scrapping the Episcopal Church , the Postal Union , the United Automobile Workers , the Brooklyn Dodgers and a great many other highly estimable and useful organizations that " exist " and that " we have got . " THE TIMES editorial admits that " to oppose these objectives , the objectives of World Government , is like opposing good health or abundant crops . " Why then does THE TIMES not use its powez and influence to enlighten the people and help accelerate thinking anc events toward these objectives instead of calling them " impossible " and " unattainable , " instead of lulling the people into believing that something which has never once succeeded will succeed now and that we shill be able to solve the conflicts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " compromise . " Public Debate Advocated The editorial further says of the United Nations : " There has been progress . There can and must be more progress . " What progress ? Progress such as was made in the cases of Manchuria , Ethiopia , Austria , Spain , Munich , the " peace in our time " progress by which it is possible to avoid war in twenty-six instances only to make its explosion certain in the twenty-seventh . Let us not delude ourselves by believing that relations between the Great Powers have become better since the establishment of the U. N. They have quite unmistakably been deteriorating , and one needs only a grain of realism to predict that the situation will become worse rather than better . This most vital issue of world peace by world government must be debated publicly . The opposing views must clash . No heat should be spared in challenging each other 's views and convictions until we arrive at a clarification of principles upon which we propose to base our future society . But this all-important debate must be fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical facts and present events , clear thinking and logical conclusions . It is not enough to repeat the quieting phrases " this is idealism . " " the people are not ready , " " let us be content with what we have . " These are not arguments , but admission of lack of arguments They are sleeping pills . EMERY REVES . New York , April 26 , 1946 . Atomic Test Queried Bikini Experiment , It Is Held , Will Be . Inconclusive The writer of the following letter is Professor of Physics at the University of Rochester , and was formerly director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Radiation Laboratory in Rochester . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The recent editorial " The Atomic Bomb Tests " in THE TIMES contains statements which should be clarified . I believe a correct ' understanding of the situation leads to the conclusion that the tests should not be held . Let us agree first that the huge initial cost of the ships to be used in the tests has nothing to do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed and they are certainly just about worthless now anyway . Let us also waive the argument about the international implications of the tests . I am not competent to comment on them , though it is my own belief that further " showing off " of the atomic bomb at this time is in poor taste , to say the least . Values Debated Let us see , then , whether the scientific values of the tests are sufficient to justify the cost and the risks . You state that " there were no scientists in the area  --  at Hiroshima and Nagasaki . " I happen to know personally several excellent scientists who were either in the bomb-carrying plane or an accompanying plane on one or both of these missions , and I know others who made extensive surveys on the ground shortly afterward . What happened when these two bombs went off is no scientific secret . Good measurements and good observations were made . You also state that " the New Mexico tests were on a small scale . " I thought everyone knew by now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scientifically speaking , these tests were on a big scale . The most brilliant scientific talent of the country was concentrated on the New Mexico tests . Oppenheimer , Bacher , Bethe , Bainbridge , Rossi , Kistiakowski , Weisskopf , and a host of other top men planned and carried out these tests . Not one of these men is involved in the Bikini tests . They are all back at their peacetime university positions , and so are most of their key assistants . Clearly , there is no assurance that the Bikini tests " will answer with scientific accuracy many of the still unanswered questions . " On the contrary , many young scientists who are participating are discouraged about learning anything at all on tests which have been so hurriedly organized and which must be carried out under such difficult conditions . I think it is safe to dismiss as negligible the scientific value of the tests . What , then , about the military value ? You state " the tests in the Pacific would provide clarification of the use of the atomic bomb as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now that neither an air nor a surface burst is a sensible way to use an atomic bomb against ships . Here again you are in error by describing the second test as an " underwater " rather than a " surface " test . A real underwater test ( e. g. , 2,000 feet under ) ? which might be effective , or at least would teach something new  --  has not yet been scheduled . What of value can be learned from an experiment in which a weapon is incorrectly or wastefully used ? We know that an air burst will damage well-built structures over an area of about three or four square miles . The fleet in the Bikini tests , it is reported , will be spread out over 100 square miles . Clearly , only three or four out of ninety ships will be damaged . Dr. Hans Bethe has already stated in the April Science Illustrated , " We can expect no sinking of capital ships , perhaps not even of destroyers . " Dissatisfaction Seen You say , " If the tests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , they should be a necessary reziinder of the fearfulness of this new weapon . " Precisely the opposite is true . The atomic scientists do not believe the tests as planned will be destructive against naval targets at all . They anticipate already the screaming headlines , " Atomic Bomb Fails to Sink Fleet . " The public reaction will be that the atomic bomb is not so bad after all , and there are many people who will encourage such a reaction . Thus positive harm rather than good will result from the test . Why not ask now rather than later the pertinent question of who wants to waste an atomic bomb on a fleet anyway when it can destroy a whole city ? If we really want a test which , as you say , " will clarify the current Navy-Air controversies as to whethei. navies T * are obsolete . " why not ask atomic bomb experts what kind of a bomb they would design and how they would use it if the objective was to destroy a fleet rather than a city . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set up the tests and the measurements . Then and only then will the tests clarify rather than confuse this issue . L. A. Du BRIDGE . Rochester , N. Y. , April 25 , 1946.
