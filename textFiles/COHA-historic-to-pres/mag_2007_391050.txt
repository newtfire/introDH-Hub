There was a beautiful Hindu woman named Ranjana ( meaning " never sad " ) Kapadia who was born and raised in Bombay and landed on the island of Manhattan , fleeing an attempted arranged marriage in 1979 at age twenty-four . A week later , she met a young Indian Muslim , Naeem Khan , three years her junior . They eloped after two years of commingling  --  potentially a worrisome endeavor in terms of family harmony  --  and together produced two sons . It was just the beginning of a fast-moving cosmopolitan life . Twenty-five years later , the couple are still married , Naeem is a prominent fashion designer , the boys are in college , and Ranjana owns a successful New York-based Indian hand-embroidery company that has her traipsing frequently back and forth from Manhattan to her homeland and Europe . " Life , " she says , " is so insane with my job . " But here 's the thing : there 's not a wrinkle anywhere on her face . Ranjana 's complexion glows , and her skin is naturally uplifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , but please , she turned fifty-two in July . Her secret ?

Photograph by lorenzo agius/Exclusive by getty images " Sometime in 2001 I was meditating , doing Kapalabhati  --  the forceful breath from the chest  --  with my hatha-yoga teacher in India , " Ranjana recalls . " After 121 such breaths your face is completely relaxed , but that 's when you really see what gravity is doing to it . It turned out I was aging like my mother . My mouth drooped . " To remedy the situation , her teacher started with a series of facial exercises that zeroed in on the wilting orifice . " Vanity was definitely the starting point , but face yoga is good for you , as regular yoga is , " she explains . " When you work out the muscles of the face , your skin gets firmer . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since become somewhat of an expert , but she realizes she 's been doing a form of face yoga her whole life because of Bharatantyam , a classical Indian dance form , which she began studying as a child . " There are a lot of facial expressions in Bharatantyam , " she says . At age eight , Ranjana mastered sending her eyebrows in opposite directions , one downward and one upward . This facial-muscle agility is useful for doing challenging face-yoga positions . But " anyone can learn them , " she assures me . " In this one you 're trying to swallow your tongue , " Ranjana says , demonstrating . " It 's a warm-up for the face . " Next she 's got me trying it . Then I 'm gently pushing air into my upper lip . Then my lower lip . Then both . Before I know it , I 'm zigzagging my tongue forcefully in my mouth underneath smile lines for asana sampling number three . Now Ranjana tells me : " The eyelid one is very important for the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyelids , keeping the distance between lashes and brows to a maximum . Hold as long as you can , breathing in and out through the nostrils . Release both simultaneously . When you go into relax mode , it becomes a blissful moment . " The lesson continues . " Yoga is an ancient science adopted by the West ; it 's become so mainstream , " Ranjana says . " Traditionally , in the yoga practice , the face and body are not separated , and there 's no emphasis on appearance except in that it reflects an inner state . And yet , why not do yoga just for the face ? Twenty minutes doing face poses and you 'll really feel it the next day . A sweet feeling for me . " She wants to share her experience . A book is in the works .

" As with any other muscles , if you do n't work them , they can atrophy . Yoga is effective for toning and may reduce facial swelling , soften some tension lines in the face and neck and help maintain a healthy glow . A relaxed face projects better contours and enhances one 's natural beauty . " For more information , consult the following : Light on Yoga ( Schocken Books ; $18 ) , by B.K.S.
