Marianne ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . One of the most lamentable consequences of the singing pictures is Marion Davies . Here she is as a French girl in love with Stagg* of the A. E. F. One of the ablest clowns in the cinema she is forced to be sentimental . A skillful pantomimic , she has to talk continually , even sing . Unalterably Irish-American she wears peasant clothes and expresses herself in a language consisting of U. S. baby-talk combined with the foreign word cheri . A French soldier who has gone blind is the dramatic obstruction in her affair with Stagg . Best shot : Marion Davies entertaining a base camp with imitations of Maurice Chevalier , Gloria Swanson , Sarah Bernhardt . <P> A Most Immoral Lady ( First National ) . The duplicity of wives who lure rich men into compromising situations so that their husbands can collect money from them has long been familiar to theatre audiences . It is less common in the cinema . The hints that before long Leatrice Joy will fall in love with one of her dupes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually makes her . Changing A Most Immoral Lady into a picture has slowed its tempo and made even more insubstantial its faint flourishes of wit . As though recognizing this the producers have dressed it up with some expensive sets and a little indifferent singing . Silliest shot : rich codger telling Miss Joy why he admires her . <P> The Return of Sherlock Holmes ( Paramount ) . When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was writing the stories that became the basis of modern detective fiction , he clearly attached no importance to frightening people and wasted no time on realism . What kept him writing was his naive pleasure in being mysterious . Director Basil Dean has retained Doyle 's point of view wonderfully well , so that instead of an overwrought modern thriller The Return of Sherlock Holmes is good fun . Obviously relishing his role as the author relished his mysteries , Clive Brook , wearing sideburns , in a woolen hat and old-fashioned loungesuits , knows just how to handle the Sherlockian pipe , as crooked and heavy as a revolver . <P> On the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many disguises along the corridors of the fastest ocean liner afloat . Adroitly he deals with dictaphones , fake wireless messages , the poisoned needle springing from the clasp of a cigaret box . When at last the Master Criminal lies dead and the fiance of the daughter of his old friend is restored to society , he punctuates with a tap of his pipe the famed , " Eleementary , Watson , eleementary . " Best shot : dinner ' for two in the arch-fiend 's cabin . <P> Frozen Justice ( Fox ) . Melodramas like this , arranged against backgrounds of snow and wintry seas , have been fine vehicles for that smart dog , Rin Tin Tin . Lenore Ulric is nicer to look at than
