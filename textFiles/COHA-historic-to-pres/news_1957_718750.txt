Three Kings of the Orient appear to be building an informal alliance against Communist penetration of the Middle East , These Kings , each different from the others , are Hussein of Jordan , Faisal of Iraq , and Saud of Saudi Arabia . The most concrete sign of their budding alliance came during Jordan 's recent government upheavals , when both King Faisal and King Saud telephoned King Hussein in Amman and pledged their troops to his support . it is reliably reported that at one point King Hussein warned the commander of Syrian troops in northern Jordan that if he did not withdraw his forces into Syria , Iraqi troops would be sent against them . N'isits Scheduled It also is reported that the Saudi Arabian Defense Minister has told the commander of 3,500 Saudi soldiers currently in southern Jordan that his troops are at the disposal of King Hussein , A further binding thread the alliance will come shortly when King Saud visits first Amman , capital of Jordan , and then Baghdad , capital of Iraq . This informal alliance , born out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by President Nasser of Egypt , flies in the face of the traditional hostility between the House of Saud and the Hashemite thrones of Jordan and Iraq . This hostility stemmed from the fact that in 1925 the late King Ibn Saud , father of the present Saudi monarch , deposed King Hussein of the Hejaz , great-grandfather of the current Hussein and Faisal , and chased him from western Arabia . Since that time the Sands have professed to suspect that Iraq in particular was determined at some time to win back the Hejaz for the Hashemite dynasty . Until recently King Saud appeared closely allied to Egypt and Syria , the two Arab states most deeply influenced by Soviet military and economic aid programs . Of late , however , King Saud is believed ' to have grown increasingly distrustful Colonel Nasser 's leadership the Syrian-Egyptian-Saudi bloc . A prime purpose of the Saudi monarch 's February visit to the United States , it is believed , was to assure himself of American support if he broke away from the Cairo-led axis . King Saud 's pledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leftist influence in Jordan was a definite sign that Saudi Arabia now is operating at least somewhat independently from Cairo , since the very people whom King Hussein removed from office were prot  --  g ? s of Colonel Nasser . The three Kings of the newly emerging alliance are vastly different in background . King Hussein of Jordan is the ruler of a barren little state with so few natural resources that it must . depend upon outside subsidy to live . King Faisal of Iraq rules over a kingdom which currently is spending 70 per cent of its $250 , - 000,000 annual oil revenues - on industrial and agricultural development of Iraq . King Saud , on the other hand , is frequently criticized , both inside and outside Saudi Arabia , for retaining too large a portion of his $300,000,000 annual income from oil for the purses of the Saudi royal family . Resistance Bolstered Both the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Middle East and the prestige of Colonel Nasser are involved in the increasingly closer ties among the three Arab Kings . Observers believe that the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Middle Eastern state cooperating in the fight against communism , gave new courage to anti-Communist elements in the Arab world . Almost certainly the potential promise of American support and economic aid was a factor in King Hussein 's April 14 royal coup d ' ? tat against pro-Soviet politicians and military leaders in Jordan . James P. Richards , President Eisenhower 's special ambassador , already has visited Iraq and Saudi Arabia with concrete aid offers from the $200,000,000 kitty at his disposal . Attention now swings to Jordan , where King Hussein is known desirous of inviting Mr. Richards to explain the terms of the American program to the Jordan Government . The events of the past few days , sharply diminishing the stature of leftist groups in Jordan , reflects against Colonel Nasser , since these leftists , led by former Jordanian Premier Suleiman Nabulsi , had taken the lead in harnessing Jordan to Cairo 's leadership . President Nasser now is seen not only to have been at least temporarily frustrated in gaining virtual control of Jordan , but also to have lost ground perceptibly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
