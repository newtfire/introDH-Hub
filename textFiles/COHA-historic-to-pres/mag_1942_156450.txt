Liberal M.P . Leslie Hore-Belisha , returning last week to London after Parliament 's August recess , felt a new and better man . He was , said he , refreshed in body , spirit and mind . Also , to his satisfaction , he had confirmed two of his favorite contentions : <P> &gt; That politicians need periods of retreat for contemplation and reflection upon the ultimate reasons for existence . <P> &gt; That the best retreat , now that the Continent is cut off from Britain , is the Abbey of the Cistercian monks in Leicester . <P> Britain 's onetime War Secretary had proved his contentions by practicing them . He had chosen the Leicester Abbey because the Cistercians isolate themselves as completely as possible , adhering to a strict rule of silence . When they must communicate with one another , they use a sign language . <P> For ten days Leslie Hore-Belisha , who used to take his holidays on the Riviera , immersed himself in the Cistercian routine . He rose at 2 a.m. for the night offices in the Abbey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prime Terce , High Mass , Nones , Vespers , Complin . Among white-habited monks he worked on the farm , helping to cut and shock corn . He watched the monks weave cloth , bake bread , bind manuscripts , work at sculpture and wood carving . He shared their single daily vegetarian meal . <P> That still left him time for contemplation , and he had several subjects worth reviewing . There was , for one , the consideration that as a forthright critic of Churchill 's war prosecution he has for two years served as whipping boy for the Prime Minister 's parliamentary tempers , receiving rebukes distinguished for their sting , even in the House of Commons . He could also reflect that it is nearly three years since he held Government office , and that the British people are looking for new leaders . He could reflect that , like the great Cardinal Wolsey in 1530 , he arrived at the Abbey stripped of political grandeur , begging : " Of your charity , spare me a piece of earth .
