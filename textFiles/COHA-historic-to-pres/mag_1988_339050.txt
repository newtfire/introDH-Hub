Twenty-five years ago , J.F. Powers reached a summit in his literary career and chose that moment to make a surprising announcement . After building a quietly distinguished reputation with two collections of stories , Prince of Darkness ( 1947 ) and The Presence of Grace ( 1956 ) , he had just won the National Book Award for his 1962 novel Morte D'Urban . In the hubbub after his prize , Powers dropped his revelation . His next novel , he told reporters , would not have a priest in it . <P> No priest ? Why , virtually everything Powers had written till then had been about Roman Catholic clergymen in out-of-the-way Midwestern parishes . He had established himself as an uncannily intimate chronicler of their workaday / lives away from the altar : their immersions in church politics and fund raising , their intramural feuds and poker-table cronyism , their struggles with vinegary housekeepers , booze and loneliness . Not that Powers by any means fell into the cozy category of " Catholic writer " ; his vision , though compassionate , was too unsparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest would be like  --  well , a John Cheever book without a commuter . <P> Years passed , and it began to look as if there might not be any novel at all . Powers published another story collection in 1975 , Look How the Fish Live , but after that came only silence . Now , at 71 , he has produced Wheat That Springeth Green , and , praise be , he has made a liar of himself . There is a priest in the book . Wheat , in fact , is devoted entirely to Father Joe Hackett , who in the late 1960s arrives as the rector of the comfortable suburban parish of SS . Francis and Clare . And once again , the central dilemma is that however much a priest may try to look to the next world , he remains hopelessly , haplessly entangled in this one . <P> Father Joe is short , overweight , too fond of food and especially of drink ; he is no crowd pleaser but no fool either , a traditionalist , competent and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , he has problems with the home office ( obstructive tactics by the chancery , presided over by Monsignor " Catfish " Toohey , a despised rival of Joe 's since childhood ) , with his clients ( an overbearing parishioner who wants to buy his child 's way into the church school ) and with his territory ( blatant boosterism for the suburb 's tacky shopping mall , dominated by the " 40-foot idol " of the Great Badger , complete with waving paw and an exposed , red neon heart ) . Even his assistant lets him down at first . When Joe gets a curate assigned to him , he turns out to be a child of the ' 60s , in jeans and T shirt , who plays folk guitar and can not type . <P> Joe has few illusions about imperfection , his own or the church 's . Yet , although he is far removed from his days as a literal hair-shirt mystic at the seminary , he still believes the church is the one sure way to salvation . This , compounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fundamental conviction : " The separation of Church and Dreck was a matter of life and death for the world . "
