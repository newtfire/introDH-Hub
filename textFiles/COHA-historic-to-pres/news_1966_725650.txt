oN THE MORNING of July 14 , 1943 , four days after allied armies landed on the south coast of Sicily , an American fighter plane flew low over the town of Villalba , circled and returned to drop a packet which fell near the church . Next day the plane returned and a second packet was dropped , this time a short distance from the house of Villalba 's leading citizen  --  Calogero Vizzini  --  for whom it was intended . It was picked up by a servant . Vizzini  --  generally known as Don Calo  --  was the head of the Mafia of all Sicily , and considered by most Sicilians to be the most powerful man in the island . Next morning , July 15 , a messenger left Villalba on horseback for the neighboring town of Mussomeli . He was carrying a letter on behalf of Don Cabo to Giuseppe Genco Russo , regarded at that time as second to Don Cabo in the Mafia hierarchy . This letter , which the messenger had been told to swallow if intercepte4 , was couched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain Mafia chieftain known as Turi would be leaving on July 20 to accompany the American motorized division as far as Cerda within five miles of the north coast while , he , Don Cabo , would be going on the same day with the main body of the army . Genco Russo was asked to do all he could in Don Caio 's absence for the security and comfort of the Americans . On July 20 , in fact , while the advance guard of the 7th army was still 30 miles away , a solitary jeep made a dash to reach Villalba and carry off the indispensable Don Cabo . The jeep , however , took a wrong turn , came under fire from an Italian patrol , and one of its crew was killed . Later that day three American tanks repeated the attempt and were successful . When in the main square an officer climbed out of its turret , he spoke in the authentic Sicilian dialect of the region . Citizens of Villalba who were present at the encounter between this officer and the formidable Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the flesh of the legendary Mafia chief . Characteristically , Don Cabo appeared in his shirt sleeves and suspenders , waddling unemotionally toward the group of nervous and excited American soldiers standing tinder the guns of their tanks . At this time he was 66 years of age , a man of bulky features and inert expression , hut with eyes that moved like lizards . Don Calo 's slovenly dress and laconic speech were typical Mafia affectations . It was not done for a Mafia chieftain to show off in the matter of his clothing or any other way , and sometimes , as in Don Cab 's case , this lack of concern for appearances was carried to extremes . Reaching the shadow of the guns , Don Cab and a nephew , Domiano Lumia , who had returned , from the United States a short time before the outbreak of war , were invited to get into one of the tanks , which then moved off followed by the others . During the whole confrontation Don Calo  --  true to his reputation for preferring action to speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next morning , on the heights of Cammarata , visible from the town , two-thirds of the Italian defenders were found to have deserted . Some of them later said that during the night they were approached by Mafia agents who convinced them of the hopelessness of their position and supplied them with civilian clothes and whatever else was needed to get home to their families . The same day the Italian commander himself was arrested by a trick while passing thru Mussomeli , and confined by the Mafia in the town hall . The battle of Cammarata was over without a shell having been fired . Don Calo was away from his capital for six days . By the time he returned to Melba the war in western Sicily was at.an end . He had dedicated the whole of his life to what the Mafia calls " winning respect , " and his prestige was now enormous . He had been nicknamed by the allies " General Mafia . " Whether or not he was responsible for American strategy in western Sicily , his followers certainly gave him the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mafia had most efficiently cleared all obstacles in the path of the American advance , while in the east the British and Canadians were still fighting their way around the slopes of Etna . It was to be three more weeks before they reached their goal at Messina . But the war in western Sicily had been terminated bloodlessly , rapidly , and to the satisfaction of all but a few diehard senior Axis officers . The Sicilians , always anti-fascist , to all intents and purposes were now anti-Italian too . Insofar as the loyalties of kinship were felt , they were toward America , where by 1943 2 million Sicilians , or first- or second-generation Americans of Sicilian origin , were living in a prosperity that was almost incredible by island standards . Many islanders were ? totally dependent on money sent back by relatives in the states . Moreover , American intelligence had seen to it that the Sicilian component of the invading force was as high as 15 per cent . Hatred of the war had become so intense that , shortly after the invasion began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military camps left unguarded by the rushing of troops to the beachheads . To the Sicilians , resistance of any kind only signified a painful delay in an occupation wholeheartedly desired by all . It was 1960 before Genco Russo , Don Cab 's second in command , permitted his version of the part he played in these few dramatic days to appear in print . In an interview given to Tempo magazine , he said , " When in 1943 the Allied armies disembarked in Sicily I arranged that the war should arrive at Mussomeli without horrors , useless cruelties , or deaths . " The day after Don Calo 's return to his capital , an intimate little ceremony took place in the barracks of the carabinieri at which he was appointed mayor by the American officer of civil affairs . That evening the new mayor gave a party for the allied officers ? " the sheep " as Don Calo called them  --  and a number of his selected friends . The friends were the members of the Mafia of Melba and such Mafia notabilities from the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wore their hair closely cropped , and their faces still bore the pallor of Mussolini 's prisons . Don Cab introduced them to the officers as victims of fascism , as indeed they were . His enthusiastic recommendations easily persuaded the military authorities to issue firearms permits all around ? " to guard against the possibility of any attempted fascist coup . " Thus Don Cab had restored to him the armed bodyguard that had been taken away by Mussolini in 1924 . The first of many victims of the resurgence of democracy was Pietro Purpi , the very carabinieri noncommissioned officer whose rueful task it had been to countersign the firearms permits . Don Calo 's next step was a more important one  --  so important , indeed , that Sicily has not yet recovered from its far-reaching effects . He compiled a list of suitable candidates for the office of mayor thruout the whole of western Sicily , and this too was found acceptable . Many of these partisans of democracy , as Don Calo pointed out , had spent long years in confinement . No one seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominees had suffered for their political ideals , rather than for crimes ranging from armed train robbery to multiple homicide . In a matter of days , half the towns in Sicily had mayors who were either members of the Mafia or were at least closely associated with it . One or two had been bandits into the bargain . A noteworthy appointment was that of Serafino Di Peri to be mayor of Bolognetta near Palermo . Di Pars first task as head of the municipality was to form a band of 109 desperadoes , who thereafter terrorized the outskirts of Palermo for the next five years . Presents for Don Cab poured in from all over Sicily . Every notability contributed to this avalanche of ? flour , cheeses , pasta , and stolen military equipment . Under the innocent gaze of the allied military government a spontaneous revival took place of an ? ancient custom dating back to the days of Roger the Norman . Don Cab had become , for the second time in his life , a feudal ruler , and these gifts were the tributes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all those who came to press Don Cab 's hand or to present their ceremonial offering were sycophants . Aside from the natural awe they felt for him , many people genuinely admired the head of the Mafia , and even those he had victimized sometimes seemed unable to repress their grudging esteem . Don Calo was a natural artist in the control of men , thru their affections as well as ? thru their fears . His immense dignity , the pithiness of his rare but massive utterances , the majestic finality of his opinions , appealed to the human search for leadership . Even men of education and intellectuals admitted their susceptibility to the strange power of attracGenco Russo ? another Mafia strong man . tion not uncommonly possessed by a " capo-mafia , " and certainly highly evident in Don Cab . The mayor of Villalba would have shaken his head at anyone who could really have believed he was a criminal . He almost certainly saw himself as the head of a self-created aristocracy of the intellect to which had been committed , as if by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed in himself as only a " mafioso " could , and with the stolid unwavering faith of religious fanaticism  --  and almost as the by telepathic contact  --  he forced those around him to become believers , too . Don Cabo knew that only he , the inspired realist in command of the Mafia , could rule Sicily as it should be ruled , and had anyone dared to oppose this assumption  --  which he would never have bothered to claim in so many words  --  he would have pointed to the total ruin Mussolini had left behind after a mere 20 years of fascist rather than Mafia rule. - Such " mafiosi " of the old school were only criminals in the eyes of the law and of abstract justice  --  and in a more confused and unfocused way in those of the peasantry they exploited . To the rest of the community they were " men of respect " and of sincere if inscrutable purpose . Tomorrow : How Sicily 's bloody history grew , over hundreds of years .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
