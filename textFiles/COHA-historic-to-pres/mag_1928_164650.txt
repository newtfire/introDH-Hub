Puking , puling , whining babies irritate the neighbors , worry fond parents . Hungry , they gobble milk frantically down , then throw it up pitifully . Last week , in a reprint from the Archives of Pediatrics , Dr. H. H. Perlman , instructor in Diseases of Children , Jefferson Medical College , announced the results of his experiments with malnourished children at the Ocean City ( N. J. ) Seashore Home for Babies . Gelatin was added to the milk for one group of babies ; another group received the same diet minus the gelatin . The gelatinized fed infants gained more , vomited less , regurgitated rarely . Gelatin makes cows ' milk more digestible by breaking up the tough , difficultly digested casein allowing the digestive juices to get at the smaller particles ; at the same time its spreading sticky quality keeps food down which in liquid form would be immediately rejected by a sensitive irritable stomach . Some idiosyncratic infants , however , may not take kindly to gelatin.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
