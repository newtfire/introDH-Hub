. The builder pumps up its popular dayboat with more equipment , an edgier style and even better performance . When I was offered a ride on the new Four Winns 210 Horizon SS , I said yes , although halfheartedly . A hard , steady wind had blown up a chop with teeth on Michigan 's Lake Cadillac . In these conditions , a passenger in a small , fast sportboat can feel like the rattling lid on a pot of boiling water . But I climbed into the bucket seat of the snazzy red boat anyway . When the needle on the tach passed 4000 rpm , I held on and prepared to take my lumps . There were light bumps and some gentle jostling , but then nothing more , even as the boat sped along the surface at wide-open throttle  --  54 mph . Credit for the surprisingly pleasant ride goes to the hull , a Stable Vee with variable deadrise for smooth handling in rough water . It 's the builder 's own patented design , one that 's been proven on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test boat is based on . The standard 210 is a state-of-theart bowrider with a reputation for good quality . The test boat is a pumped-up version of that model . As part of the Signature Series , it has more aggressive styling  --  red or yellow gel coat and a low-profile windscreen give it attitude  --  and more equipment , like pop-up cleats , a stainless prop , through-hull exhaust and a color-matched custom trailer . The SS version is offered with more power , too  --  up to 320 horses for a breath-stealing ride . This well-built dayboat definitely draws attention . If someone offers you a ride , do n't hesitate to say yes . BOX FOUR WINNS 210 SPECIFICATIONS LOA 20 ' 10 " BEAM 8 ' 6 " DRAFT ( DRIVE DOWN ) 33 " WEIGHT ( W/ENGINE ) 3,250 LBS .

Speeds measured by GPS on Lake Cadillac , Mich. , in 10-knot winds w/two people on board , half fuel and no water . Sound levels measured at the helm in dB-A . BOTTOM LINES : The Stable Vee hull does more than enhance acceleration , which is excellent . It 's also designed to get up on plane at a lower speed to save fuel during take-off . And with two pods near the stern , there 's less drag when the boat 's on plane , so it runs faster and more efficiently . Reverse chines make for reliable handling . The 210 turns on command and does n't slide over the water like some other hulls will . It digs in . TRIM TIPS : We recorded 54 mph at top end , but the 210 can probably go faster . Because of strong winds and a chop , we could n't maximize trim on the test ride . Owners should experiment with trim .
