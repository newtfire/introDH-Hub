Four months after announcing a major reform of the city 's Police Department , Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper has bumped into political delays , bureaucratic constraints and a budget crunch . <p> In December , the mayor unveiled a plan that called for an array of training programs and less-lethal equipment - a proposal that aimed to calm rising anger about the Police Department 's use of force . <p> The plan is off to a fitful start : Some efforts have been started , others postponed and some are still under review . <p> And the task force that is the highlight of the reform - examining the department 's use-of- <p> force policy and a process to include civilian oversight - has asked for a two-week delay in its report . <p> That specially appointed mayoral task force was supposed to release its recommendations today , but the mayor granted it a two-week extension . <p> Hickenlooper 's spokeswoman , Lindy Eichenbaum Lent , said the mayor is pleased that his administration has made progress on his plan , but he 's pushing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector , Mayor Hickenlooper is never satisfied with how long it takes to make change in large government bureaucracy , ' Lent said . ' But within the existing constraints , we believe we 've made significant progress on these significant reforms in a few short months . ' <p> The city 's tight budget has tied up some of the police reform efforts . <p> For example , the crisis intervention training ordered for 300 police officers over the next two years has been tied up while Police Chief Gerry Whitman searched for funding . <p> One of the biggest problems is paying overtime to police officers who fill in while other officers are getting training , Whitman said . The classes take 45 hours over five days . <p> ' We have to backfill those positions so officers can go to class , ' Whitman said . <p> About $ 300,000 of the cost of training is for overtime pay , said Margaret Browne , the city 's finance director . <p> To pay for it , Whitman has had to scrounge through the department 's 2004 budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding that some training has started . ' It comes down to setting priorities . ' <p> When Hickenlooper announced the reform program , he said the city found $ 1.2 million to pay for it . That money had been set aside to pay for outside legal services and to match a federal grant . <p> But the city still fell short of the total $ 2 million needed and Hickenlooper vowed to find that funding . <p> This month , the city budget office agreed to shift about $ 825,000 from a radio-replacement fund to help the department pay for its training programs and to buy 100 Taser stun guns . Those Tasers have been purchased . <p> Browne said the money to replace radios will now come from a grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security . <p> But not all the issues affecting the reform efforts are financial . <p> The Police Department faces bureaucratic obstacles to create a mental-health case manager . <p> Whitman said the process of establishing the new post is time- <p> consuming because the city 's Career Service Authority must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That 's because the mental- <p> health case manager will be a civilian , rather than a Police Department employee . To set the pay scale , the authority reviews how other employers set compensation for the job . <p> And that takes time . Whitman said a previous effort to ' civilianize ' the human resource director of the Police Department took almost two years . <p> Not all hiring decisions are so slow-moving . The city attorney 's office has already assigned a lawyer to work full-time with the department on training , tactical and policy issues , City Attorney Cole Finegan said . <p> But other changes recommended by Hickenlooper are still grinding through the political process . <p> Key city leaders are still studying how to ' strengthen community relations . ' Hickenlooper wants the city 's Department of Human Rights and Community Relations to lead forums between the Police Department and community groups . <p> Those forums are to focus on cultural sensitivity , racial relations and community policing standards . <p> Lucia Guzman , director of the community relations department , said she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is waiting for Hickenlooper 's task force to complete its review of how to handle use-of-force cases . <p> Guzman said her office has interviewed people in Los Angeles and Connecticut who run such programs . The goal is to gather ideas on how to ' build bridges of understanding between the community and police . ' <p> But she said her department was waiting for the task force recommendations and for a decision in the punishment of police officer James Turney , who shot and killed 15-year-old Paul Childs in July . <p> Police were called to the Childs household after a family member called 911 to report that the teen , who was developmentally disabled , was brandishing a knife . Turney shot Childs , who was still holding the knife , after the police officer ordered him to step out from behind a door . <p> Last fall , Denver District Attorney Bill Ritter concluded that Turney did n't commit a crime and declined to press charges . <p> But this month , Denver Manager of Safety Al LaCabe recommended that Turney be suspended for 10 months without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to the city 's Civil Service Commission . <p> At the same time LaCabe announced his decision , he complied with one of Hickenlooper 's December recommendations that called on the manager of safety to issue a report whenever a police incident involves use of force and results in a citizen 's death or serious bodily injury . <p> Guzman said her department 's role is to promote healing for the city , and that 's why action needs to wait until the recommendations from the task force are available . <p> ' I think we all went into this owning part of the situation , ' Guzman said . ' This is something that belongs to the city . It does n't just belong to the family of Paul Childs . It does n't just belong to the police . It does n't just belong to the mayor . <p> " It is something that has happened that is calling the city to a new place , " she said . " It is going to take time to establish the structure to get there , but it belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In December , Mayor John Hickenlooper unveiled a series of efforts to change the way Denver police interact with citizens . Highlighting that effort was the creation of a 90-day task force to examine proposals on the use of force and civilian oversight of the department . Listed below are Hickenlooper 's other initiatives and their status . <p> Increase and accelerate crisis- <p> intervention training : Hickenlooper called for boosting the total number of trained officers to 500 , from the current 200 , during the next two years . Training has begun , but Chief Gerry Whitman struggled to find funding to pay for overtime . City budget officers recently agreed to make about $ 825,000 available for training and equipment purchases . <p> Accelerate Taser and less- <p> lethal shotgun training and deployment : The city has purchased 100 new Tasers , or stun guns , to increase the number available for patrol officers to 300 . Officers are already trained to use Tasers . <p> Expand the existing Firearms Discharge Board to include citizen members : A draft policy has been established for the police to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The board has not been convened since Hickenlooper made the recommendation . <p> Create a Use of Force and Tactics Review Board : A draft policy has been written and a sergeant assigned to the effort , Whitman said . <p> Initiate a Manager of Safety Report : Al LaCabe , Denver manager of safety , issued the first such report this month after his inquiry into the shooting of Paul Childs by officer James Turney . <p> Assign a lawyer and mental- <p> health case manager to the Police Department : City Attorney Cole Finegan said a full-time lawyer has been assigned to the department . The Police Department is still working on the case manager job and is seeking funding , Whitman said . <p> Hire a minority recruiter : Whitman said funding for the post has been approved , disapproved and reapproved . The department is working to fill the job . <p> Strengthen community relations : City officials are studying efforts in other cities and plan to convene forums after the community reacts to the recommendations of the Hickenlooper task force on the police use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @
