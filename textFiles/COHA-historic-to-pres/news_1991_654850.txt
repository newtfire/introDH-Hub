THERE is a sense of expectation in the crowded change-room as we fasten white overalls and straighten our hard hats . <p> Minutes later the huge metal cage - with three decks containing 30 people on each deck - is hurtling toward the center of the earth at 2,500 feet per minute . <p> The deafening noise of steel-on-steel , the humid air , dank aroma , and surrounding darkness reminds the visitor that he is entering an alien and dangerous world . <p> Western Holdings mine - No. 3 shaft - is typical of hundreds of shafts that penetrate deep into the reef of gold-bearing rock that describes an arc from a point east of Johannesburg and southward to this Orange Free State town . But the magic of gold - a symbol of South Africa 's economic wealth - is beginning to fade because of soaring production costs and a static world gold price . <p> " Gold has become more a luxury commodity used in jewelry than a store of wealth , " says Anglo American Gold Division chairman Clem Sunter , announcing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . <p> As South Africa 's gold industry enters its worst crisis since its inception a century ago , it is looking to its research wing to streamline techniques and cut costs . <p> Recent advances in deep-mining technology hold out the prospect of a safer working environment and savings for mine owners that , in turn , could reduce the number of retrenchments and mine closures . <p> " If you put together all the progress that has been made , it will certainly help the gold industry through difficult times , " says John Sheer , director of the Chamber of Mines Research Organization . <p> Despite safety measures in effect , South Africa 's 450,000 black workers in the gold mines face constant danger in the form of rock bursts , gas leaks , underground fires , and land falls . <p> About 9,000 mine workers are injured - and 500 die - each year . But the most serious threat facing black mine workers at present is that of retrenchment in a climate of economic recession . <p> Since black mine workers went on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut - at least 40,000 through direct retrenchment . The industry predicts that a further 80,000 jobs are threatened . <p> Last week(Apr.18) the giant Anglo American Corporation announced that it is cutting back its work force - which numbered 200,000 two years ago - by a further 12,500 to about 180,000 . <p> South Africa 's share of world gold production has dropped from 70 percent in 1980 to 36 percent in 1990 . <p> But recent breakthroughs in the cooling of deep-level mines , hoisting methods , and techniques for stabilizing rock could hasten the mining of new gold deposits . <p> One major advance has been in the area of overcoming heat stress in mines that go two miles down , such as the Anglo American 's Western Deep Levels mine - the world 's deepest mine - near Carletonville . <p> " About 250,000 ( 50 percent ) of the work force in the gold-mining industry operate at one mile or deeper and about 25,000 work at depths of below 1.6-miles , " says Horst Wagner , senior operations manager for the Chamber of Mines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59 to 68 degrees F ) on the surface in summer , increase by 1 degree C for every 250 feet of depth in most of South Africa 's gold mines . <p> This means rock temperatures of up to 50 and 60 degrees C ( 124 to 140 degrees F ) can be encountered at a depth of two miles . <p> ' WHERE environmental temperatures approach body temperature ( 37 to 38 degrees C. ) , the danger of heat stress occurs , " Dr. Wagner says . " Research has shown that about 10 percent of people are heat intolerant . " <p> Methods have been devised to identify such people and ensure they have surface jobs . <p> The ideal is to cool the air in the mine to a temperature of 28 degrees C ( 82 degrees F ) . <p> The gold-mining industry has pioneered a system of ice-cooling that is more efficient - and cheaper - than water- or air-cooling . <p> " In deep mines , air-cooling is ineffective because the air increases by 5 or 6 degrees C for every 900 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and auto-compression , " says Wagner . <p> Water-cooling involves massive refrigeration costs to cool the water , and electricity costs to pump the used water out of the mine . <p> " The beauty of ice-cooling is that when it changes from solid to liquid the latent heat factor is utilized , " Wagner says . " Four times the volume of water would be needed for the same result . " <p> The new two-mile deep East Rand Property Mine east of Johannesburg has been designed to run on ice-cooling with an ice-making machine that produces 6,000 tons in 24 hours . " The ice is then pumped down the mine in a pipeline and cools down the air through rock contact and direct heat exchange through water sprays , " Wagner says . <p> Increasing use of hydro-power mining equipment - rock drills driven by hydrostatic pressure - means electricity savings , improved labor productivity , and safer conditions in deep-level stoping ( rock-face ) operations . <p> A first visit to a stope-face is a sobering experience for a stranger to the mines . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate the heavy hydraulic drills , often crouched in narrow openings in the rock . Here sweat mingles with water-sprays in a relentless battle to release the gold ore from the compacted rock . But technological research can make a difference . <p> The industry has developed a water-powered impact hammer for breaking quartziferous rock that is so efficient that it eliminates the need for explosives - the ultimate goal of mining research . <p> The new Northam platinum mine owned by Goldfields north of Johannesburg has been developed exclusively on the basis of hydro-power . <p> Other major advances have been made in the field of rock stabilization . Hazardous rock bursts currently account for more than half of all mine accidents . <p> One method , known as back-filling , fills the mined areas by pumping coarse sand and mined material back into the void . The technique is being used in coal mines in Poland and in the deeper coal and silver mines in the United States , according to Wagner . <p> THE industry has also developed a stope-face support system that allows props to be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduces the chances of blast-induced rock falls , " Wagner says . <p> Perhaps the most revolutionary breakthrough in this field is the development of hydraulic props to replace the old wooden pillars . The rapidly yielding hydraulic prop gives way quickly but then returns to take up the slack after a rock burst , thereby achieving a far higher degree of control in rock movements . <p> Already about 250,000 hydraulic props are installed in mines nationwide . They are also being used in mines in the US , China , and Germany . <p> The biggest potential cost-saving is in hoisting , where advances in the steel used for wire rope and the findings of safety research have brought the industry to the verge of a breakthrough . <p> Instead of two sub-shafts having to be sunk in deep mines in the future , a single shaft with one hoist will suffice in even the deepest mines . <p> Reduced safety standards are being tested with ore hoists and the industry is waiting for the government to approve legislative implementation . <p> Wagner predicts that using single hoists could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years . <p> On capitalization of $800 million , this could mean a savings of $250 million over two years in interest alone . <p> It would also mean a huge savings in capital expenditure and far greater efficiency in the running of the mine . <p> " As most new discoveries are around the two-mile mark this could help the industry immensely in the midst of its deepest crisis , " says Adrian Du Plessis , a senior general manager of the Chamber of Mines .
