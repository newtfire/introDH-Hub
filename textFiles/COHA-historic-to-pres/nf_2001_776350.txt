" You Kidding Me ? " // Issue 1 : Sexual deviants who prey on children // The Opponent : Floyd Abrams , First Amendment attorney // O'Reilly : This does n't have anything to do with free speech . // Abrams : But of course it does . // O'Reilly : No , this has to do with aiding and abetting , promoting a crime on a website. // If you are thirty-five or older , chances are good that your childhood in America was pretty much like mine , no matter where you grew up . By age six I was out of the house most of the time after school and all during the summer , playing with my tight group of friends . There were limits . For example , if I was late for dinner at six o'clock , there was hell to pay . // Otherwise I was on my own in the great outdoors . My parents seemingly had no fear that I would be harmed by sinister outside forces marauding around my Long Island neighborhood . Sure , I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks . My father did n't sound like football announcer John Madden , but he had Madden 's mind-set : " Play rough  --  take your chances . " // With my dopey friends , whom you might have met in my last book , The O'Reilly Factor , I made the most of the deep woods three blocks from my house . We climbed thirty feet up into the thick leafy branches to build rickety tree houses . We tunneled underground like moles . We threw rocks at each other . We rolled around in the dirt completely unsupervised by annoying adults . // It never occurred to us that some older guy in an overcoat might drive up and try to hurt us . Yes , my father once said something about never taking a ride with a stranger . But he did n't say why , did n't make an issue out of it , and did n't seem concerned that his eldest son might be taken hostage at some point . // How times have changed . And that 's the terrifying subject of this chapter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who I believe is absolutely wrong in putting the rights of special ( read perverted ) interests ahead of the safety of American children . // Parents today are rightfully worried about their children being abducted or abused , even in their own neighborhoods . But why is that ? Are there more child molesters in the United States now than in my childhood years in the fifties and sixties ? Are they bolder for some reason ? Is it possible they are being encouraged ? // Statistically , it is impossible to know . Officials at the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services say they do not have accurate statistics for child abuse and abduction before 1990 . According to the federal government , more than 100,000 American kids were sexually molested in 1998 , or one and a half children per one thousand . In 1999 nearly 32,000 kids were kidnapped  --  most by relatives . England does a better job of tracking the danger-to-kids trend . Scotland Yard says the number of convictions for gross indecency with a child doubled between 1985 and 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacing to children and that more adults are willing to risk imprisonment and social destruction to molest kids . The question is why ? // Some believe that widespread , often-hysterical TV coverage has possibly encouraged deviant behavior toward children . Because of television news , crimes against children have been magnified greatly . The heartbreak of any child damaged by an adult is spread from coast to coast immediately and the experts start prattling , some of them sympathetic to the " disease " or " condition " of the victimizer . No one can say for sure , but the notoriety of the crimes may attract pedophiles who are risk takers . We are obviously not talking about rational people here . // But there is also something else in play in this country that is much subtler : the gradual contagion of nonjudgmental acceptance . The result of this contagion is that behavior that would have been roundly condemned forty years ago is now " understood " or in some cases even accepted . // Two college-student parents killed their newborn baby and left his body in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of calls of sympathy and support . After all , it was " understandable " that they panicked . In the end , a judge sentenced them to less than three years in prison . // In Wisconsin an expectant mother tried to poison her fetus with alcohol one day before the due date . She received no jail time , as supporters petitioned the press and the court with tales about her life of woe . // Throughout the country drug-addicted babies are routinely returned to the mothers who have already damaged them physically and perhaps limited their learning potential for life . But remember : The mother has a disease . Can society deprive the mother of raising her own children ? Well , I damn well would . But I seem to be in the minority these days , as my " understanding " threshold does not reflect the society in which we live . In all the examples I 've cited , the child 's life is devalued in favor of the adult 's " situation . " How did this happen in America ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our first encounter in the No Spin Zone : The welfare of a child means less today because of the promotion and acceptance of certain so-called special interests . The most notorious example  --  and I am not making this up  --  is an organization based in the United States called the North American Man-Boy Love Association . It advocates the legalization of sex between men and boys as young as eight years old . Read that sentence again and digest the eight-years-old part . This vile NAMBLA group was formed in 1978 and calls for the " empowerment " of youth in the sexual area . It says it does not engage in any activities that violate the law . // Oh yeah ? What about the fact that NAMBLA was involved in funding an orphanage in Thailand that allowed grown men to rape and molest the children who lived there ? And what about the case of child rape in Ohio where NAMBLA was found guilty of complicity in the crime ? The Ohio Court of Appeals ruled that NAMBLA 's literature , found in the possession of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rape . // It gets much , much worse . A NAMBLA member recently raped and murdered a young boy in Massachusetts . In October 1997 ten-year-old Jeffrey Curley was playing near his home in Cambridge when two men tried to lure him into a car . When he resisted , Salvatore Sicari and Charles Jaynes got brutal . They wound up killing the boy and then drove to Maine , where they dumped the boy 's body in a river . // Both men were eventually arrested , convicted , and sentenced to life imprisonment . Prosecutors at the trial produced as critical evidence a diary kept by Jaynes . In it he flat out stated that he became obsessed with having sex with young boys after he joined NAMBLA . How did the organization allegedly poison him with its ideas ? According to the diary , Jaynes received NAMBLA literature in the mail and visited the group 's website on computers at the Boston Public Library . Clearly , these NAMBLA people wanted to get their message out . According to lawyers familiar with the website , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with men and also supplied information on what an adult should do if caught . // Jeffrey Curley 's parents are suing NAMBLA in federal court for $200 million . And guess who is defending NAMBLA in the case ? Can you spell ACLU ? That 's right . The most powerful free speech watchdog in the world is using its money and resources to make sure that NAMBLA is not driven out of business . Is this an outrage or what ? // The amazing truth is that the American Civil Liberties Union is spending membership dues defending the lawsuit . In a statement it said , " Regardless of whether people agree with or abhor NAMBLA 's views , holding the organization responsible for crimes committed by others who read their materials would gravely endanger our important First Amendment rights . " // Baloney ! I respect the ACLU 's goal of protecting the rights of all Americans . At their best , this group is courageous in defending legitimate expressions of opinion , some of which , like the Nazi marches , are pretty vile . But NAMBLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not built into our Constitution . // Attorney Floyd Abrams walked onto The O'Reilly Factor set confident and clear-eyed . He had won many of these debates in the past . In my introduction to the segment , I told the audience that I believed NAMBLA was guilty of promoting statutory rape and was a seditious organization in the sense that it wanted to undercut the moral foundation of the United States . Abrams opened his remarks by saying that " the ACLU serves the public by serving even an awful bunch of creeps . " Then we got down to the heart of the matter and things got heated . // O'Reilly : This does n't have anything to do with free speech . // Abrams : But of course it does . // O'Reilly : No , this has to do with aiding and abetting , promoting a crime on a website. // Abrams : If that 's what they do , then the family will win the case . But until they show that , there should be somebody brave enough  --  and the ACLU is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're dead wrong because what the ACLU is doing is allowing an organization to corrupt children . In doing so the ACLU becomes part of the crime if it wins and allows NAMBLA to get away with it . // Abrams : So they should n't have a lawyer , right ? // O'Reilly : They should n't have the ACLU. // Abrams : Throw them in jail . // O'Reilly : I 'd put them in jail in a heartbeat. // Abrams : I know you would . // O'Reilly : Each lawyer has a responsibility to choose the case that promotes justice . // Abrams : These people need the ACLU. // Sure they need it , because they are a criminal enterprise that exists for only one reason : to encourage statutory rape . The ACLU 's representation is free , and NAMBLA is staying alive because of it . When the ACLU chooses which cases to take , it has a responsibility to the people who are paying dues to it . The thing is , no decent human being should be helping NAMBLA , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization has stained itself with this case . // It should be obvious that I am a big free speech supporter . The Factor would have been shut down a long time ago if the First Amendment was n't sacred . But we need a clear-thinking ACLU to protect our freedom of expression , not some radical organization that is lost in a fog of self-righteousness . I asked ACLU President Nadine Strossen to address this NAMBLA issue , but she declined . That was interesting . Ms. Strossen has talked with me before and is anything but camera shy . // And what about the authorities ? Why is n't the Justice Department prosecuting NAMBLA ? If the Ohio court nailed them , what 's wrong with the feds ? The answer to that one is that the feds do n't care . We have become a nation held hostage to self-serving rationalizations of special interest groups . The Zone is sickened by the cowardice of the Justice Department as well as by the ACLU 's irresponsibility . Using the First Amendment as a cover for the subversion of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " rights " issue is a disgrace . // " One thing NAMBLA did n't say was go out and kill anybody , " Abrams said to me . " One thing it did n't say was go out and rape anybody . " // But as any good citizen knows , it 's not what you do n't say that counts , it 's what you do say . If the ACLU can not acknowledge that it is a crime to conspire to have sex with children  --  a hurtful and brutal act physically , emotionally , and morally  --  then the American Civil Liberties Union does not deserve our respect or our support . // Chapter Two // Reading , Writing , and the Joy of Sex // Issue 2 : Sex ed in your child 's classroom // The Opponent : Dr. Joycelyn Elders , former surgeon general of the United States // O'Reilly : But you know how kids are . As soon as masturbation is brought up , they 'll run out and tell their friends . . . // Elders : Poor children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just throw them away ? I think not . // It 's not just the shameless perverts we need to worry about . Our children can also be assaulted by well-meaning public officials , teachers , and other adults in responsible positions . And these intrusions on the young are far more powerful than the lurid crimes that grab headlines because they are often very personal and delivered to the child one-on-one by influential adults . // Take the supposedly enlightened movement toward sex education . Right now , in many of the nation 's public schools , there are sex education classes that get right to the heart of the matter . You get the what , you get the how . You get the birth control . You sometimes get nonverbal approval and , in rare cases , outright encouragement to engage in sexual activity . Driver 's ed leads to driving a car , right ? Sex ed has to be handled with the proper touch ( pardon the pun ) or , well , you get the idea . // I taught high school in Opa-locka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst slums in South Florida . The kids at my school knew all about sex , drugs , and rock and roll . They needed guidance , not instruction . They needed emotional maturity and perspective . They listened very , very closely to everything an adult said about sex and especially the way it was said . // Sex ed for me was " the talk " my father gave me when I turned thirteen . It was awkward for both of us , as the Irish are n't exactly known for their Dr. Ruth-like candor in these matters . " The talk " was also somewhat unnecessary . I already knew the basics from seminars with my friends , using Playboy magazines as text . And my father 's words were highly theoretical because the reality was , I had about as much chance of landing the great white whale as I did of having sex . Teenage girls want to date smooth guys . I was a barbarian . But I gave my father points for trying . // As a young teacher I was more relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was careful . Students have a way of misquoting any provocative comments , and that can lead to big trouble in a Catholic high school . Some of my students as young as fifteen were having sex and almost everyone in the school knew about it . I encouraged the use of contraceptives for any American who did not want to become a parent . I spoke of this in a general sense , illuminating the lesson with specifics about poverty , divorce , and child deprivation . Most of the kids got the message . Some did n't . It is always that way . // Predictably , the school administration did not like my kind of direct approach . They were determined to control the sexuality of the students by threatening them with various punishments for risque behavior . This of course was insane . The more you just say no , the more enticing certain kinds of behavior become . The issue came to a boil over football , of all things . //              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
