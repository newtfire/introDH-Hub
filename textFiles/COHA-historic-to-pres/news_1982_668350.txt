By Lloyd Timberlake LONDON - One hundred years ago , Robert Koch , a German county health officer , isolated the organism which causes tuberculosis ; now a vaccine can help to prevent TB and inexpensive drugs can cure it . " Yet why is it today , on the centenary of his discovery , that the number of tuberculosis cases in the world is actually increasing ? " demands World Health Organization ( WHO ) director General Halfdan Mahler . " Between four and five million highly infectious cases emerge each year , and TB brings death to at least three million persons annually , " he writes in the WHO magazine " World Health . " Dr. Mahler calls for " a new commitment to eliminate TB as a major health problem , at the latest by the year 2000 . " It is a logical apparently attainable , goal . In the West , TB mortality fell four fold in the first 40 years of this century , even before the advent of efficient anti-TB drugs . This was accomplished mainly by rises in standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this century , TB deaths fell 50-fold in developed nations , thanks primarily to about 10 new drugs and generally improved public health . But in countries such as India , Indonesia and Bangladesh , and in parts of Africa , the rates at which people contract TB remain the same . As these large populations are growing by 2-3 percent annually , and as TB rates in the developed world are now falling very slowly , total TB cases worldwide are increasing , according to the Bulletin of the International Union Against Tuberculosis . As Mahler notes , TB is as much an outcome of socio-economic as of biological factors : " undernutrition , inadequate housing , poor hygiene , lack of water , the debilitating effects of acute infections and diarrhea and lack of awareness of the real causes of ill health . " Drs . Antonio Pio and Jerzy Leowski of WHO ' s Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases Unit go even further : " Today we possess all the necessary weapons to wipe out tuberculosis . The key elements that are required to defeat the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial resources and the political will to make it possible . " TB treatment has come a long way since the days when doctors prescribed flannel wraps , bleeding , purging and leeches over the windpipe , along with such medicines as arsenic , mercury , iodine and gold - and opium to control the cough . Before Koch isolated the TB bacillus in 1882 , people were thought to be either prone to the disease , or not . And the artistic temperament was thought most prone . TB , or " consumption " as it was known , carried off such creative figures as the English poet John Keats , the Polish composer Frederic Chopin and the Russian writer Anton Chekhov . Patients were isolated from the community - an effective step , as the bacillus is spread mainly by air - but it has since been proved that the sanitorium regimes of bed rest , fresh air and complex diets are of little use . The discovery of the X-ray in 1895 let doctors see the lesions TB causes in the lungs . However , mass X-ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Third World , being judged both expensive and inefficient . Microscopic sighting of the bacillus in a patient ' s sputum now confirms diagnosis . In 1944 , an American team headed by Selman Waksman discovered streptomycin , the first antibiotic effective against TB . ( Both Koch and Waksman won Nobel Prizes for their work . ) In 1966 , the drug rifampicin was developed , allowing doctors to shorten treatment periods from one year to six months , but at greater expense . Cost of treatment now varies between $15 and $250 , depending on the drugs used . The BCG vaccine , discovered by French scientists A. Calmette and C. Guerin ( BCG= Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin ) costs 2-5 cents per dose . It has been included in WHO ' s six major vaccines ( along with those against diphtheria , measles , polio , whooping cough and tetanus ) , despite recent , disputed evidencefrom an Indian trial that it may not be as effective as thought . The arsenal of anti-TB drugs can not only cure the patient over several months but can render him non-infective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmates is no longer necessary . And that is the major problem . A TB victim who feels fit and can work normally is unlikely to continue taking daily medication for a year . As health workers must supervise the medication of TB patients , particularly in developing countries , routines have been developed that call for only six months of daily pills or even weekly doses for one year . No matter how inexpensive the medicine , such supervision , along with the expensive work of locating TB victims , strains the health programs of most Third World countries . But improved health care is not enough . Recent campaigns against TB around the world have shown that little can be done in the face of widespread malnutrition . Also , many houses in the Third World tropics are dark and airless , to keep out insects ; but these are conditions in which TB bacilli flourish . And the endemic diseases of developing countries can lower resistance and pave the way for TB infection . Thus the scourge of TB is intimately tied to the Third World scourges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes Dr. Mahler ' s call for the elimination of TB as a major health problem by the year 2000 a much more ambitious goal than it first seemed .
