On the night of Sept. 27 , 1972 , Bobby Lowe was walking his German shepherd named Ginger in front of his home on Chicago 's west side . Lowe noticed William Logan , a neighbor who was a Teamster steward , strolling to his car at the curb . As Lowe vividly recalled the scene in courtroom testimony , an auto suddenly pulled up . Shots rang out , and " Mr. Logan flew back ... into some bushes . " Next , said Lowe , a man sprang out of the car , apparently carrying a handgun , and walked up to Logan . Just then , Ginger lunged at the stranger . Lowe said that he grabbed his dog-and came face to face with the murderer . <P> For Bobby Lowe , now 28 , those stark moments of recognition in 1972 had led to a five-year tale of personal distress , fear of Mafia reprisals , and courage that came to a dramatic climax last week in the Cook County criminal court in Chicago . Lowe was the star witness in a case brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Aleman , 38 , one of the most feared hit men in the Chicago Mafia . Police suspect that Aleman was involved in 22 murders , including one in which the victim was ripped three times through the neck with a broomstick . But none of Aleman 's 20 previous arrests were for murder , and the stiffest sentence he had ever received was a three-year probation in 1971 for falsifying a mortgage application . <P> From the start , Lowe did not want to be a witness in the murder case .

" I did n't feel it was safe for my kids on the street . Did you ever watch a horror movie ? You 'd be sleeping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Well , this was the same way . I 'd be trying to sleep , and I would see that face . I was always looking behind me , looking for a car to pull up alongside me . " <P> Three months after the murder , claims Lowe , he went to the local police headquarters and , after examining photos , picked out the killer . At that time , says Lowe , he did not learn the name of the man . The police , however , can find no records that Lowe did show up . No case was brought against Aleman . <P> Then , in March 1975 , a gangster named Louis Almeida was arrested for carrying weapons equipped with silencers and received a ten-year sentence . In exchange for the chance of getting an early parole , judicial immunity and protection , Almeida agreed to testify about past crimes . One was the murder of William Logan . Almeida told the police he had driven Aleman to Logan 's home . Officials surmised that Aleman was after Logan because the Teamster had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
