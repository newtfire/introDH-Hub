Introduction // T he idea of a Not So Big House , a house that favors the quality of its space over the quantity , has evolved during the 15 years I 've practiced architecture in the Twin Cities . Maybe it was the 1980s that created what I call the " starter castle " complex  --  the notion that houses should be designed to impress rather than nurture . More rooms , bigger spaces , and vaulted ceilings do not necessarily give us what we need in a home . And when the impulse for big spaces is combined with outdated patterns of home design and building , the result is more often than not a house that does n't work . // When my husband and I , both of us architects , were planning our new house , we knew that we wanted a home that would inspire us and make the best use of the money we had to spend . Whatever we ended up with , we wanted our house to express the way we actually live . We started the planning process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not formal people , and the separation between kitchen and living space meant that we spent all our time in the kitchen  --  the tiniest room in the house . To change that , however , we would have had to add more space , which would have made our house bigger while leaving half of it still unused . That option did n't seem sensible . In fact , it seemed downright wasteful . // I quickly realized that our old house was designed for a pattern of life that was fundamentally different from the way we live today . So we decided to design our own house  --  which would be Not So Big  --  with each space in use every day . And it would be beautiful . I 've designed big houses that are beautiful and small houses that had tight budgets ; I wanted our house to combine the beauty of the big house with the efficiency of the small one . Rather than spend our budget on square footage we would n't use , we decided to put the money toward making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by building such a house we would be going out on a limb , because the institutions that dictate the value and resale of houses demand all the extra spaces that we knew we would never use . When we met with the banker and explained that our new house would have no formal dining room , he was dubious . But as I described to him my frustration with designing large houses with rarely used formal spaces , and my vision to put forward a different home model into the marketplace , his demeanor completely changed . Suddenly , he was telling us about his own house , a suburban Colonial , and admitting that in 25 years his family had never sat in the living room . They lived in their family room . The banker , who at first appeared to be our biggest obstacle , became our strongest advocate . // So we built our house , and along the way many of the ideas that had been percolating in my subconscious came into being . I began to speak locally and nationally about the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of confirmation from audiences . Even realtors , who perpetuate the conventional wisdom of resale requirements , were excited by the concept of building Not So Big . In fact , two realtors  --  a husband and wife team  --  approached me after one lecture and asked that I design a Not So Big House for them . // This book contains the work of more than 35 architects and related professionals who I have had the privilege of working with in our architectural firm in Minnesota . These colleagues have worked with more than 3,000 residential clients over the past 15 years . As a result of all this work , we get to see the aspirations , the struggles , the needs , and the realities of people who want new or remodeled homes . Architects build dreams , but we also have to help clients reconcile those dreams with real budgets . A house that favors quality of design over quantity of space satisfies people with big dreams and not so big budgets far more so than a house with those characteristics in reverse . // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house that is more than square footage ; a house that is Not So Big , where each room is used every day . A house with a floorplan inspired by our informal lifestyle instead of the way our grandparents lived . A house for the future that embraces a few well-worn concepts from the past . A house that expresses our values and our personalities . It 's time for the Not So Big House . // The Not So Big House is n't just a small house . Rather , it 's a smaller house , filled with special details and designed to accommodate the lifestyles of its occupants . I 've discovered living in my own Not So Big House that the quality of my life has improved . I 'm surrounded in my home by beautiful forms , lots of daylight , natural materials , and the things that I love . Our house fits us perfectly and is unabashedly comfortable . My house feeds my spirit , and it is with this insight that I share with you how to make your house do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not everything that can be counted // counts , and not everything that counts // can be counted . "  --  Albert Einstein // So many houses , so big with so little soul . Our suburbs are filled with houses that are bigger than ever . But are bigger houses really better ? Are the dreams that build them bigger , or is it simply that there seems to be no alternative ? Americans are searching for home in unprecedented numbers . Yet when we look , the only tools we seem to have are those we find in the real estate listings . But a house is more than square footage and the number of beds and baths . In one of the wealthiest societies ever , many people are deeply dissatisfied with their most expensive purchase . Which is where Paul and Laura come in. // I had just completed a lecture at our local Home and Garden Show . As I stepped from the podium , I was greeted by several members of the audience who wanted to thank me for saying something they had n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in house design . There was a couple in the crowd with a story about their own experience , a story that gave me the impetus to write this book . As they approached me , I saw tears in the woman 's eyes . // " We want you to come to our new house and tell us what you think , " she said . " We just built it . We spent over $500,000 on it and we hate it . It 's just not us at all . After listening to you , we think ... " She paused and looked at her husband , who nodded . " We know that we have to start over . All we 've got is square footage with no soul . We want the type of house that you describe . Can you help us ? " // The next week , I drove out to the suburbs to see the house , past row after row of enormous structures covering the newly developed hillsides . These houses loomed in their treeless sites , staring blankly out toward vistas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was driving through a collection of massive storage containers for people . // Paul and Laura 's house was fairly typical of new , large subdivision homes . It had the required arched window topping off a soaring front entrance scaled more for an office building than a home . Inside the house , I was greeted by an enormous space , all white , with a cold marble floor . There was no separation between this vaulting foyer and the next room , which I assumed must be the family room , although there was no furniture in it ( see the photo on p. 10 ) . Laura ushered me into the kitchen , which was also oversized and made up of all hard surfaces that gave it the acoustics of a parking garage . // She and Paul explained to me that until a year before , they had lived in the city , in a small , older home . Although they liked the house , their three boys were growing up quickly , and they were starting to feel cramped for space . The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a place to be rambunctious . The couple found a piece of property they loved . The lot was owned by a builder , who made it clear as part of the terms of sale that he would be the one to build the home . They thought this would be fine  --  they did n't know any other builders and this one had a good reputation . // The builder showed them his portfolio of plans and explained that they could choose any one of them . Although they were n't particularly enamored with any of the plans , they picked the one that seemed to have the rooms they needed in the right relationships to one another : kitchen opening into family room , formal living room separated from family room to allow kids some space to play away from mom and dad . // It was n't until the house was actually under construction that the feeling of uneasiness began to set in . As the framing proceeded , the heights of the spaces became clear , as did the proportions of each room . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // They asked to make some changes , such as lowering some ceiling heights and dividing a room in two to make each a more manageable scale . But such changes would be very expensive at this stage in the process , the builder explained , promising that , " When the house is done , you 'll love it . " However , the house did n't get better , and when it was finished , it was clear to both of them that they felt no affinity for it . It seemed ostentatious to them . The scale of each room was overwhelming . // Laura took me upstairs to show me the master bathroom . " Look at this , " she exclaimed , " our previous bedroom was n't even this size ! " Although the couple now faulted themselves for being naive , they were simply following the process that is standard to working with a builder and selecting from a stock set of plans . They were not offered an opportunity for input into the design . And they did n't know how to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of their lifestyle and their values . Like many people building a new house , Paul and Laura did n't have the words to describe what they wanted , nor did they realize how important it was to have input into the " feel " of the house . If a builder hears that a home buyer wants a spacious family room , he reasonably assumes that they are asking for a BIG family room . To Paul and Laura , almost anything would have seemed spacious compared to their previous home . // The outcome was that Paul and Laura had built a $500,000 house that was nowhere close to their dream of home . After spending almost three times the value of their previous house , they were deeply unhappy . They told me they felt no desire to make the house their own by furnishing it or personalizing it in any way . Their story was horrifying to me . And even more alarming is the fact that Paul and Laura are not alone . Over the last couple of years , more and more people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our office and asked , " Is there an alternative ? Can you design us a house that is more beautiful and more reflective of our personalities  --  a house we will enjoy living in ? " // The answer is , of course , yes . And the key lies in building Not So Big , in spending more money on the quality of the space and less on the sheer quantity of it . So this book is for Paul and Laura and for everyone like them , whether building from scratch or remodeling , who wants a special home that expresses something significant about their lives and values but who does n't know how to get it .
