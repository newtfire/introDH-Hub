At well-publicized ceremonies in Washington last week , A.F.L. President George Meany and C.I.O. President Walter Reuther got 65 A.F.L. and 29 C.I.O. unions to sign a no-raiding agreement that calls for arbitration of jurisdictional disputes . Although Reuther and Meany grinned for the cameras and predicted that the A.F.L. and C.I.O. would join forces before the pact expires ( December 1955 ) , the peace pact was almost worthless . Reason : non-signers included Dave Beck , whose powerful A.F.L. Teamsters openly lay claim to 50,000 men in rival unions , and Dave McDonald , president of the C.I.O. United Steelworkers , who has his eye on A.F.L. aluminum and shipping workers , and , as much as he might like labor unity , dislikes Walter Reuther more .
