I was in the bathroom at school , sitting down on the toilet , humming a song . I had my pants on . I 'd come in near the end of English class , feeling sick . My teacher , Mr. Dalton , is great about things like that . He 's smart and knows when you 're faking and when you 're being serious . He took one look at me when I raised my hand and said I was ill , then nodded his head and told me to go to the bathroom . " Throw up whatever 's making you sick , Darren , " he said , " then get your behind back in here . " I wish every teacher was as understanding as Mr. Dalton . In the end , I did n't get sick , but still felt queasy , so I stayed on the toilet . I heard the bell ring for the end of class and everybody came rushing out on their lunch break . I wanted to join them but knew Mr. Dalton would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't get mad if you trick him but he goes quiet and wo n't speak to you for a while , and that 's almost worse than being shouted at . So , there I was , humming , watching my watch , waiting . Then I heard someone calling my name . " Darren ! Hey , Darren ! Have you fallen in or what ? " I grinned . It was Steve Leopard , my best friend . Steve 's real last name was Leonard , but everyone called him Steve Leopard . And not just because the names sound alike . Steve used to be what my mom calls " a wild child . " He raised hell wherever he went , got into fights , stole from stores . One day - he was still in a stroller - he found a sharp stick and prodded passing women with it ( no prizes for guessing where he stuck it ! ) . He was feared and despised everywhere he went . But not by me . I 've been his best friend since kindergarten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn to his wildness , but I just thought he was a great guy to be with . He had a fierce temper and threw scary tantrums when he lost it , but I simply ran away when that happened and came back again once he 'd calmed down . Steve 's reputation had softened over the years - his mom took him to see a lot of good counselors who taught him how to control himself - but he was still a minor legend in the schoolyard and not someone you messed with , even if you were bigger and older than him . " Hey , Steve , " I called back . " I 'm in here . " I hit the door so he 'd know which one I was behind . He hurried over and I opened the door . He smiled when he saw me sitting down with my pants on . " Did you puke ? " he asked . " No , " I said . " Do you think you 're gon na ? " " Maybe , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a sick noise . Bluurgh ! But Steve Leopard knew me too well to be fooled . " Give my boots a polish while you 're down there , " he said , and laughed when I pretended to spit on his shoes and rub them with a sheet of toilet paper . " Did I miss anything in class ? " I asked , sitting up . " Nah , " he said . " The usual crap . " " Did you do your history homework ? " I asked . " It does n't have to be done until tomorrow , does it ? " he asked , getting worried . Steve 's always forgetting about homework . " The day after tomorrow , " I told him . " Oh , " he said , relaxing . " Even better . I thought .... " He stopped and frowned . " Hold on , " he said . " Today 's Thursday . The day after tomorrow would be .... " " Got you ! " I yelled , punching him on the shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He rubbed his arm but I could tell he was n't really hurt . " Are you coming out ? " he asked then . " I thought I 'd stay in here and admire the view , " I said , leaning back on the toilet seat . " Quit joking , " he said . " We were down five-one when I came in . We 're probably six or seven down now . We need you . " He was talking about soccer . We play a game every lunchtime . My team normally wins but we 'd lost a lot of our best players . Dave Morgan broke his leg . Sam White transferred to another school when his family moved . And Danny Curtain had stopped playing soccer in order to spend lunch hanging out with Sheila Leigh , the girl he likes . Idiot ! I 'm our best forward . There are better defenders and midfielders , and Tommy Jones is the best goalkeeper in the whole school . But I 'm the only one who can stand up front and score four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , standing . " I 'll save you . I 've scored a hat trick every day this week . It would be a pity to stop now . " We passed the older guys-smoking around the sinks as usual-and hurried to my locker so I could change into my cleats . I used to have a great pair , which I won in a writing competition . But the laces snapped a few months ago and the rubber along the sides started to fall off . And then my feet grew ! The pair I have now are okay , but they 're not the same . We were down eight-three when I got on the field . It was n't a real field , just a long stretch of grass with painted goalposts at either end . Whoever painted them was a total idiot . He put the crossbar too high at one end and too low at the other ! " Never fear , Hotshot Shan is here ! " I shouted as I ran onto the field . A lot of players laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and our opponents growing worried . I made a great start and scored two goals inside a minute . It looked like we might come back to draw or win . But time ran out . If I 'd arrived earlier we 'd have been okay , but the bell rang just as I was hitting my stride , so we lost nine-seven . As we were leaving the field , Alan Morris ran toward us , panting and red-faced . They 're my three best friends : Steve Leopard , Tommy Jones , and Alan Morris . We must be the weirdest four people in the whole world , because only one of us-Steve-has a nickname . " Look what I found ! " Alan yelled , waving a soggy piece of paper around under our noses . " What is it ? " Tommy asked , trying to grab it . " It's- , " Alan began , but stopped when Mr. Dalton shouted at us . " You four ! Inside ! " he roared . " We 're coming , Mr. Dalton ! " Steve roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with stuff that the rest of us could n't do . Like when he uses swearwords sometimes in his stories . If I put in some of the words Steve has , I 'd have been kicked out long ago . But Mr. Dalton has a soft spot for Steve , because he 's special . Sometimes he 's brilliant in class and gets everything right , while other times he ca n't even spell his own name . Mr. Dalton says he 's somewhat of an idiot savant , which mean he 's a stupid genius ! Anyway , even though he 's Mr. Dalton 's pet , not even Steve can get away with showing up late for class . So whatever Alan had , it would have to wait . We trudged back to class , sweaty and tired after the game , and began our next lesson . Little did I know that Alan 's mysterious piece of paper was to change my life forever . For the worse ! ( Continues ... )             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
