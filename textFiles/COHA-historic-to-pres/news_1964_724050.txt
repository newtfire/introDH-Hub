CIVIL RIGHTS BILL DUE TO BE PASSED BY SENATE TODAY Action to Come One Year to the Day After Kennedy 's Request to Congress HOUSE APPROVAL SEEN Southerners Deliver Final Attacks  --  Northerners Say Measure Is Overdue By E. W. KENWORTHY Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON , June 18 ? The Senate slowly wended its oratorical way today toward a final vote on the civil rights bill . The expectation tonight was that the vote would come tomorrow about 3 P.M.  --  a year to the day after President Kennedy sent the bill up . Last night , the Senate cleared the way for passage when it adopted , by a vote of 76 to 18 , the Dirksen-Mansfield substitute to the House-passed bill , and then gave it a third reading . This foreclosed any - further consideration of amendments . Hopes of the bipartisan leadership for a final vote today evaporated early as Southern opponents , one after another , rose to protest against what Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia called " the manifold evils " of the bill and to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urged For their part , several Northem advocates praised the measure as long overdue and urged that state and local officials loyally support it as at least a legal beginning in. solving the urgent racial problems facing the nation . Under the rules , each Senator has an " hour to speak after closure is invoked , and this can be fragmented as he pleases . Closure was voted June 10 . When the Senate convened this morning , the Southerners had remaining to them a combined total of just over 10 hours . Most of this was used up during the day . The bill would outlaw discrimination in public accommodations ; in the use of public facilities such as parks and golf courses ; in employment and union membership , and in federally aided programs . Would Add Powers It would also give the Attorney General new legal means to speed school desegregation and enforce the Negro 's right to vote . The substitute approved last night was largely the work of Everett Dirksen of Illinois , the Republican leader , who consulted closely with the Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the floor managers of the bill , Hubert H. Humphrey , Democrat of Minnesota , and Thomas H. Kuchel , Republican of California . The differences between the substitute and the bill passed by the House on Feb. 10 are in emphasis - nd not in coverage . The substitute gives more scope and time to state and local agencies to deal with complaints of discrimination in jobs and public accommodations . Furthermore , where the // House bill would allow the Government to initiate suits in behalf of individual complainants in these two areas , the substitute allows him to , start pro  --  edings only where he finds a " pattern " of discriminatiee . Senate leaders have kept in close consultation with those in the House . Therefore , no , trouble is foreseen in getting House acceptance of the sub-1 stitute after the Rules Committee has cleared it for floor ! action . If Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia , the House Rules chairman , should delay calling his committee , three members can petition for a meeting . If he consents to a meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he refuses to call a meeting after three days , a majority of the committee can " take the committee away " from him and call a meeting . Could Delay Bill 10 days Therefore the most " Judge " Smith can delay is 10 days . Although Mr. Smith abominates the bill , he is also a realist and is unlikely to engage in futile delay . If he did , there could still be a House vote by July 2 , but it would be a close thing . President Johnson would like to have the bill by July 3 so he can have a ceremonial signine on July 4 . The Republicans would like to accommodate him because they want the bill to become law before their National Convention opens , on July 13 . Furthermore , House Republicans want to recess July 2 or 3 for the convention preliminaries . The Administration would like to keep the House in session until July 10 to deal with the poverty package and other bills . However , Representative Charles A. HaHeck of Indiana , the Republican leader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Administration is in his debt for supporting the compromise civil rights bill last fall . And it will need his help in getting the Senate substitute to the floor if Mr. Smith is recalcitrant . Meanwhile , two Senate supporters of Barry Goldwater followed the lead of the Arizonan in declaring their opposition to the bill . Norris Cotton of New Hampshire , although he voted for closure , said he could not vote for the bill because it still retained the " vicious and dangerous " titles outlawing discrimination in jobs and public accommodations . These " do not relate to Government 's relation to its citizens , " Mr. Cotton said , " but deal with citizens ' treatment of one another . " For the same reasons , Milward L. Simpson of Wyoming said he would vote against the bill . He voted against closure . However , Wallace F. Bennett of Utah , another Goldwater supporter who voted against closure , said he would vote for the bill and praised Mr. Dirksen for rendering " the Senate and the country a great service . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern bloc , said that " no group of men could have- worked harder in a nobler cause . " " We have fought the good fight until we were overwhelmed and gagged , " he said . Accuses the Press He charged " the great metropolitan press , the radio and television " with magnifying the " emotional appeals " in support of the bill , and minimizing or omitting " the arguments as to its dangers . " Mr. Russell was particularly severe with the clergy , who organized support for the bill . He said " the philosophy of coercion of the men of the cloth " was the same as that which motivated " Torquemada in the days of the Spanish Inquisition . " Nor did he spare his old friend and pupil , Lyndon B. Johnson , even though he did not name him . " I resent and resent bitterly , " he said , " the attempt to make the people and the section I have the honor to represent the eternal whipping boy for the political aggrandizement of any official of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor because his time had run out , Senator Lister Hill of Alabama said of him : " We have been led by a lion . " Senator Allen J. Ellender of Louisiana said the bill was called a civil rights bill , but " in truth it is a social acceptance bill . " This acceptance , he went on , can not be conferred by legislation but " must be earned . " Leverett Saltonstall , Republican of Massachusetts , said the bill " will not in itself bring about equal rights and opportunities " for Negroes . " This bill is a first step , but it is a giant step and it is taken with this knowledge that it represents the feelings of the great majority of the American people , " he said . Hiram L. Fong , Republican of Hawaii , spoke for a full hour , praising the bill as an extension of the ancient Hawaiian tradition of multi-racial society . Alan Bible , Democrat of Nevada , who voted against closure as a member for a small state , said the bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " only be sectional to any area " where " citizens are denied their equal . rights . " Strom Thurmond of South Carolina , who offered the most amendments to the bill , said its passage " will mark one of the darkest days in history . "
