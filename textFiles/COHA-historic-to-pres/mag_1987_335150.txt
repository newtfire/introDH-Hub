The FCC warning to radio stations about the use of offensive language and material on the air is an insult to the public ( NATION , April 27 ) . Americans should be allowed to decide on their own what is indecent . When they are , offended by what they hear , listeners can change the station or turn off the radio . <P> Mary Alice Wood <P> Quincy , Mass . <P> The stock response " If you do n't like it , you do n't have to listen " is a phony argument . No one has the right to foul the airways any more than he has a right to foul the streets . God bless those in the FCC who have the courage to try to enforce a level of decency . <P> Jim Parker <P> Virginia Beach , Va . <P> The airways are really a buyer 's market . If you do not like what you are hearing , you can turn it off . If enough people do not listen to a program , it becomes commercially unprofitable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctimonious paternalism . <P> Theodore C. DeZabala <P> Wayne , N.J.
