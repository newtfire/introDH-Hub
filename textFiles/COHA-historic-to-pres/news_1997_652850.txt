TOMAS GUTIERREZ ALEA was already ill with the cancer that would soon kill him when he made " Strawberry and Chocolate , " the bittersweet comedy that in 1995 became the first Cuban film to go into general release in the United States and be nominated for an Oscar . So when the success of that movie led to other offers , he understood from the start that he had received a rare gift : a final opportunity to sum up a lifetime of work and ideas . <p> The result is " Guantanamera , " which opens Friday and addresses , not surprisingly , the twin themes of love and death . Delineating the odyssey of a dead woman 's body and the friends and relatives who accompany her coffin from one end of Cuba to the other , the movie manages to ridicule the rigid Stalinist bureaucracy that was one of Gutierrez Alea 's favorite targets ( though not to the extent desired by his exiled compatriots here ) even as it exalts human attachments and passion . <p> " All of Titon 's movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mirtha Ibarra , the Cuban actress who is Gutierrez Alea 's widow and appears in both " Guantanamera " and " Strawberry and Chocolate , " said during an interview here , using the nickname for her husband by which he was known in Cuba . " But this one may be especially so because of the circumstances under which it was made . " <p> Born into a well-to-do Havana family , Gutierrez Alea , who was 69 when he died last year , originally studied to be a lawyer . But the films of the Italian neo-realist movement captured his imagination , and he went to Italy in the early 1950 's to learn about movie making . His international reputation was established by " Memories of Underdevelopment , " which was released in 1968 and chronicles a bourgeois intellectual 's difficulties in adapting to life in a revolutionary society . But within Cuba , he was probably best known for sly satires like " Death of a Bureaucrat , " a 1966 work that foreshadows " Guantanamera " in both theme and style . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title from the famous Cuban ballad and reworks the song 's lyrics so that it comments on the plot , was shown in Havana in 1995 , audiences flocked to theaters to see it , fearing that it would soon be withdrawn from circulation . They chuckled at the figure of Adolfo , a pompous bureaucrat whose every utterance is a stale cliche of revolutionary sacrifice taken straight from the pages of Granma , the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party , and roared at the misadventures that befall the corpse because of an absurd Government plan to make burials more efficient . <p> Working with Gutierrez Alea " was a privilege on both the professional and personal levels , " Juan Carlos Tabio , who because of the director 's illness became co-director of both " Strawberry and Chocolate " and " Guantanamera , " said from his home in Havana . " He was the master of modern Cuban cinema , and part of what made him so was his flexibility and his spirit of criticism and self-criticism . " <p> " We knew each other for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hard to explain , " Mr. Tabio continued . " He worked with me in one way or another on every project I 've ever done . It 's not that Titon was able to find some sort of philosopher 's stone that eluded the rest of us . But he had the strength to accept reality and tackle that reality in his work . " <p> In fact , as bizarre as the plot of " Guantanamera " may seem , it was born , the director 's widow said , of a newspaper story Gutierrez Alea clipped in the late 1980 's , when Cuba 's shortage of gasoline was becoming acute . To save fuel , Communist Party bureaucrats had actually devised a plan that would require coffins to be transferred from one vehicle to another any time the boundary of a province was crossed , in order that no province exceed its gasoline quota . To that idea , Gutierrez Alea added , as was his habit , observations from his own notebook and snatches of dialogue heard on the streets of Havana . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a comedy of the absurd , " Ms. Ibarra said . " But it 's not . It is a comedy drawn from reality , an X-ray of the island of Cuba . " <p> Indeed , anyone who has traveled the length of Cuba in recent years will quickly recognize scenes from daily life that Gutierrez Alea reproduces almost intact : the eerie absence of traffic on the highways ; the families that wait for hours and hours for buses that never come , then crowd into the back of the rare passing truck ; the flourishing illegal roadside commerce in meat and vegetables , which are bought and sold in American dollars , not Cuban pesos . " Guantanamera , " in short , is a road movie that shows a society dispirited and in decay . <p> BUT MANY CUBAN DIRECTORS and screenwriters now in exile in the United States , including several who say they still regard Gutierrez Alea as a mentor or friend , argue that in " Guantanamera , " as in his earlier movies , he compromises his principles and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sergio Giral , who defected to the United States six years ago and has recently directed a documentary about the Cuban cinema called " The Broken Image , " is one of them . <p> " Titon was a filmmaker and intellectual who sought in every way to use the means of expression at his disposal to question the system , " Mr. Giral said in an interview here . " But he fell into a trap and was never really able to do any damage to that system , which is inhumane . In Cuba there are no films that really dispute the system , because the Government will never permit it . When something critical is released , it comes out too late and thus is no longer critical . It has lost its value , which is precisely why it is allowed to come out . " <p> Jorge Ulla , a Cuban filmmaker who now lives in New York , also has mixed feelings about Gutierrez Alea . " To me , he is a tragic figure , " said Mr. Ulla . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a vast body of work that shows a fine intelligence . But he could n't , or would n't , talk about the real problem , which is intolerance . In the final analysis , this is a man who was torn between his Socialist convictions and his reservations about the figure of Fidel Castro . Once embarked on this revolutionary adventure , he was unable to break with it , and that limited his message and his work . " <p> Politely but firmly , Ms. Ibarra refused to be drawn into any discussion of the political controversy surrounding her husband 's work . <p> " I do n't see why I should have to do that , " she said . " If I were an actress from another country , you would n't even be asking me such questions . " But she rejected outright the notion that Guiterrez Alea had ever softened his message or sacrificed his integrity as an artist in order to please the authorities . <p> " Titon was honest and always said what he wanted to say , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , and defended them . Besides , censorship is relative . In your country , the producer gets the final cut . That 's censorship , too , and Titon never had to contend with that . " <p> To Ms. Ibarra , " Guantanamera " is first and foremost an elegy , a work of art rather than a political statement . " This movie is a song in praise of life and love , " she said . " That 's what he wanted ; he was very clear about that . He knew this was going to be his last movie , that death was there , within reach , waiting for him . So he wanted to deepen his sense of life , and speak out in favor of awakening and living one 's life intensely . " <p> " Guantanamera " reunites Ms. Ibarra with one of her fellow cast members in " Strawberry and Chocolate , " Jorge Perugorria , who played the role of the homosexual Diego , who strikes up an unlikely friendship with a fervent Communist who is heterosexual . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a macho , bearded truck driver who has a girlfriend at every stop along the road . Ms. Ibarra , in turn , exchanged her role as a conniving but earthy black marketeer for that of an economics professor trapped in an unhappy marriage . <p> " That was deliberate , " Ms. Ibarra said . " After ' Strawberry and Chocolate ' became a success and the Spanish came in as co-producers for ' Guantanamera , ' one condition they set was that both of us , Jorge and me , be in the movie . So Titon said , ' Let 's reverse the roles . ' So we revised the script and revised the characters , which only enriched the story . " <p> Gutierrez Alea left behind at least two scripts that Ms. Ibarra says are " ready to be filmed this instant . " One is a Caribbean version of " The Tempest . " The other , written with Mr. Tabio and a Cuban playwright , is called " Weekend in Bahia " and is essentially , said Mr. Tabio , " a dialogue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit from the United States and the fiance left behind whom she re-encounters . " <p> " Even before he became ill , Titon worried about time getting away from him , that there was not enough time at hand to accomplish everything he wanted to do , " Ms. Ibarra said . " But those last five years were happy years , despite the cancer . They were rich , intense years in which he enjoyed everything . He painted and he listened to music . But it was the cinema he loved most of all and which fused all the artistic restlessness he had . "
