Former Gov . John B. Connally , the square-jawed , silver-topped politician and businessman whose image became synonymous with Texas , died Tuesday from complications related to pulmonary fibrosis , a lung disease . He was 76 . <p> Connally was admitted to Methodist Hospital May 17 complaining of breathing difficulties . He was diagnosed with an infection and pneumonia . His condition worsened two weeks ago , and his wife asked friends to pray for him as he was placed in the intensive care unit . <p> But he did not respond to treatment . <p> " " We deeply thank all of those whose thoughts and prayers have been with us throughout this ordeal , " Mrs. Connally said in a statement released by the hospital . " " It was those thoughts and prayers that gave John the best possible chance to recover . We always will be grateful for your kindness . " <p> Services for Connally will be at 2 p.m . Thursday at First United Methodist Church in Austin . Burial will follow at the State Cemetery . His body will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state Capitol from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m <p> Connally is survived by his wife , Idanell Brill " " Nellie " Connally ; a daughter , Sharon Ammann of Austin ; two sons , John B. Connally III of Houston and Mark M. Connally of Austin ; three brothers ; two sisters ; eight grandchildren ; and one great-grandchild . He was preceded in death by a daughter , Kathleen . <p> The week before his hospitalization , Connally announced his involvement in a multimillion-dollar effort to build the first pari-mutuel horse racing track in the Houston area . <p> If there was an important or difficult deal that needed doing , Connally 's assistance often was sought , though less so in the years that followed his very public 1987 bankruptcy . <p> Connally , who was wounded during the assassination of President Kennedy , boasted a long and impressive resume that included a Cabinet position in the Nixon administration . He alternated in business and politics for most of his life , constantly moving from one position to the next as his challenges and fortunes shifted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the ear of several presidents , but he could never parlay that into the ultimate proof of his talents : the presidency . It may have been the only thing he ever really wanted that he could not get . <p> His three two-year terms as Texas governor , from 1963 to 1969 , proved to be his longest stint in one place and , perhaps , his greatest contribution to public life . Though often lambasted by the liberal wing of the state Democratic Party , he eventually was praised by some of its most loyal members . <p> " " Governor Connally was a much more progressive governor than he ever got credit for being , " said U.S. Rep. Charles Wilson , D-Lufkin , who often knocked heads with Connally while in the Texas Legislature . " " He was really a very enlightened governor  --  and a terrific man . " <p> The simple facts of John Bowden Connally Jr . ' s life seem spun from the stuff of Texas myth . He was a poor boy from the country who did well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the side of Lyndon Johnson , and in time found himself orbiting among the state 's elite . <p> Determined , smart and as tough as the mesquite that infested the family ranch near Floresville , " " Big John " was less a man than an icon . He became the Stetson-topped , ramrod-straight embodiment of the Texas that in the 1960s was emerging from its rough-hewn past in a dazzling wave of Sun Belt expansion . <p> For two decades , Connally seemed poised at the edge of greatness . He leapt for it in his 1980 campaign for the presidency , but fell short . The completion of what one biographer likened to a Shakespearean fall from grace came a few years later , when the state 's economy collapsed from a frenzy of overdevelopment and he collapsed along with it . <p> Even in bankruptcy , however , Connally maintained a mythic dimension . Media from all over the country came to chronicle his colossal debt . It was impossible to escape the notion that Connally , in some essential way , was Texas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe , really , " said Robert Strauss , a close friend since college who , like Connally , has been in and out of government for the last three decades . " " The closer you got , the larger he became . . . He had that quality of leadership . " <p> Connally was born Feb. 27 , 1917 , in Floresville , one of seven children of J.B. and Lela Wright Connally and a fifth-generation Texan . His ancestors were potato-famine Irish by heritage and had never really prospered . His father was at various times a tenant farmer , bricklayer , butcher , barber and bus driver . When John was young , J.B. used $ 1,200 he had painstakingly saved to buy a small ranch , to which he moved his family . <p> John attended public schools in San Antonio and Floresville . <p> He did his homework by the light of a kerosene lamp  --  the ranch house had no electricity . He knew what it was to work behind a mule-drawn plow . He also knew what it was to be looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rest of his life seemed almost an exercise in repudiating that judgment . <p> Connally attended the University of Texas , where he received a law degree in 1941 . He served from 1939 to 1941 as a secretary to Lyndon Johnson , then a U.S. representative . <p> In 1940 , Connally married Nellie , his college girlfriend . <p> He joined the Navy as a lieutenant just before World War II , served in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific and saw combat aboard the carrier Essex . He attained the rank of lieutenant commander and received , among other decorations , the Bronze Star . <p> After the war , Connally organized an Austin radio station , KVET , and served as its president and general manager until 1949 . <p> In addition , he worked on behalf of rural electrification and managed Johnson 's barely successful 1948 campaign for the U.S. Senate . <p> In 1952 , Connally became attorney for legendary wildcat oilmen Sid Richardson and Perry Bass . He was an officer in many of Richardson 's vast enterprises and , when Richardson died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Connally was appointed secretary of the Navy by President-elect Kennedy in December 1960 . He held the position less than a year , resigning to run for governor of Texas as a Democrat . <p> Connally defeated saber-rattling Republican Jack Cox . <p> In November 1963 he was wounded in the attack that killed Kennedy during a trip to Dallas . <p> In 1969 , bored with governmental life and the limitations placed on the governor 's position , Connally returned to private law practice , joining the Houston firm of Vinson &; Elkins as a name partner . True to form , he did not stay long . <p> In 1970 , President Nixon persuaded Connally to become Treasury secretary . In 1972 he resigned to head a group called Democrats for Nixon . In 1973 , after LBJ 's death , Connally officially announced that he was switching to the Republican Party . <p> Connally 's name was floated as a potential vice presidential candidate when Spiro Agnew resigned amid scandal , but congressional reaction was unenthusiastic . <p> In August 1974 , Connally became embroiled in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had accepted a $ 10,000 bribe to convince Nixon to raise milk price supports . A jury acquitted Connally of the charges . <p> In 1980 , he ran for the Republican presidential nomination and  --  after spending $ 11 million , $ 500,000 of it from his own pocket  --  he withdrew with only one delegate to show for his 13 months of formal campaigning . <p> He went into business with Ben Barnes , a former Texas lieutenant governor , and borrowed more than $ 200 million to build shopping centers , office towers and residential developments . To back much of their borrowing , the two men put up their personal wealth . For Connally , that totaled between $ 6 million and $ 15 million . <p> When the bottom fell out of the Texas economy , Connally 's fortune vanished as he filed for bankruptcy , listing assets of $ 13 million and debts of $ 93.3 million . He and his wife auctioned most of their personal possessions in an attempt to pay secured creditors . <p> TYPE : Obituary
