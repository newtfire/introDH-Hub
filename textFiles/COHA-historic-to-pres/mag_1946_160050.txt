Modern weapons ( guided missiles with or without atomic warheads ) have made the British Isles indefensible against a power holding the Continent . Looking far ahead , military men ( who must visualize World War III even as statesmen struggle with the peace ) realize that the U.S.British defense system must find other strategic strong points . In a stratospheric rocket war , the best offense may be a deep defense . <P> Last week , as Britain 's political leaders reaffirmed the bonds linking Britain and the U.S. ( see above ) , her strategists in London were reorienting to a global defense centered on the Indian Ocean . Some old soldiers still romanticized about the vulnerable Mediterranean " life line , " but a new school of planners envisioned a military girdle ( with a two-way stretch ) around Africa 's equatorial belly . <P> No Retreat . In Nigeria , on the underside of western Africa 's Atlantic bulge , the British might have a shipping and supply contact either with the home isles or , in dreaded necessity , with a refugee government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kenya , along any of several possible roads , absorb a string of World War II airbases , make a junction with the north-south Cape Town trunk road ( see map ) . <P> The British plan was no retreat . With evacuation of Egypt guaranteed within three years , the Empire needs more room and stability than either Palestine or Trans-Jordan can afford . There would be some barriers-natural and political . In Cairo this week , Egypt 's ailing Premier <P> Ismail Sidky Pasha , back from London discussions ( sometimes limited by Sidky 's bladder trouble ) , embarrassed Britain by letting his spokesman claim that Bevin had promised Egypt sovereignty over Anglo-Egyptian Sudan . A quick denial came from the British , who had no intention of surrendering military or administrative control of this northernmost link in the prospective Nigeria-Kenya chain . <P> From the Sudan south , the Central African bastion would widen out . From it , the British would be able to slam the gates of Suez on any aggressor . They could rake an enemy in the Persian oilfields with rockets launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union , the African girdle might be a potent barrier to Russian expansion across the Middle East toward India. * <P> Crouch &; Swing . There was no Maginot Line mentality in the Central African conception . The 19,000-foot snowcap of legendary Kilimanjaro might be a figurative Gibraltar at the approaches to the Indian <P> Ocean , but the field of rocket fire would stretch south to the protected seaways of Good Hope , north to the Middle Eastern land bridge uniting three continents . Britain ( or Suez ) could be saturated overnight by enemy rockets ; huge Africa could absorb thousands , and still shoot back . In those green hills far away , Britain ( and the U.S. ) could , if the worst came , crouch defensively , have time and room to launch an atomic roundhouse . <P>
