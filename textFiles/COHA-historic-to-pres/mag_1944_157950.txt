Every year , some 1,300 people in the U.S. die by accidental electrocution . But electricity in quantity is not nearly so deadly as most people suppose . Two-thirds of those electrified by potentially lethal currents survive the shock . In fact , the stronger the shock , the better the chance of survival : 40,000 volts or more are only about one-third as lethal as lower voltages . <P> These are some of the findings reported in the current Electronics by a Westinghouse engineer , H. A. Poehler . Twenty-five states have adopted electrocution as the most efficient method of capital punishment . But the electric chair stacks all the cards against its occupant . It uses moderate voltage ( about 2,000 ) and current ( less than eight amperes ) , and contacts moistened with salt water , to lower the occupant 's resistance . This virtually assures instant death , because moderate voltage is best calculated to disrupt the cycle of the human heartbeat . <P> Three Ways to Die . Electricity can cause death in three different ways : 1 ) by burning ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops breathing ; 3 ) by " ventricular fibrillation " of the heart , i.e. , breaking up the normal rhythm of the heart muscles . Of these , the heart effect is by far the most dangerous , for it is virtually impossible to restore the normal beat , once interrupted . Fortunately , most accidental electric shocks attack not the heart but the nervous system , and victims can usually be revived by artificial respiration . <P> High voltages are least likely to be , fatal because they do not cause heart fibrillation , and because they usually throw the victim clear of the circuit . Some 88% of those shocked by 40,000 volts or more recover . Engineer Poehler suggests that to free an individual from a live circuit it is better to use one 's foot than a hand ; the current is then less likely to reach the heart or respiratory nervous system . <P> A human being 's vulnerability to electric shock is determined largely by skin resistance . Water reduces skin resistance more than a hundredfold . About the most dangerous possible electric shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , received by anybody with wet hands or feet . Even at only 100 volts , it means certain death .
