AND YALE REVIEW . No . CCLIII . APRIL , 1891 . ARTICLE I.-CAUCUS LEGISLATION . To one who looks , with a discerning eye , on the development of modern political methods , the growth of legislation by secret party caucus looms up as a most alarming portent . It is not that the decisions . of the caucus are uniformly or even generally bad , it is not that they do not often conduce materially to the public good , that we should regard the evolution of this part of onr political system as an evil , for the deliverance of the caucus may breathe the spirit of the most exalted patriotism and may embody the frnits of the highest degree of wisdom . It is not the caucus per se that we need to fear . Of itself , it may be and often is a very proper , not to say necessary , adjunct to the work of practical legislation . By resorting to it , no doubt , much unnecessary delay , much wasteful discussion , is in many instances avoided . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into great favor because of its usefulness , it nevertheless threatens to undo the work of more than a century of legislative progress . It is rapidly becoming the bulwark of corruptionists and the potent weapon , by means // of which the virtue of the well intentioned may , with the utmost ease , be overcome . Irresponsible itself , it seeks to free the individuals who participate in it from all responsibility . No one is accountable for the beginning of its labors , and it is boldly claimed that no one shall be held to account for carrying the results of those labors into effect . By its operations , it is made possible to thrust measures upon the public , for the origin of which no one is to blame , but which , whether good or bad , every one must support , or be subjected to the severest blame and censure . Its more radical devotees seek to make of it a legislative juggernaut , and remorselessly to crush beneath its wheels the independence and manhood of legislators . As a result of its workings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dozen men apologizing for their own disregard of the promptings of conscience , on the ground that some thirteen of their associates had no conscientious scruples to disregard ; and We see the whole voting as a unit for some pernicious measure , because the major portion had no moral sense , and the smaller number , no moral backbone . To secure obedience to its decrees in all cases and at all hazards , its uncompromising advocates unblushingly appeal to that sense of honor that calls for the fnlfillrnent of an obligation once entered into , for the keeping of a promise whether expressly or iinpliedly made . The obligation of submission to the majority of the caucus is placed above the obligation of the oath of office , and thus , that which is in itself a virtue is made subservient to that which is in itself a vice . Though a legislative body may be composed of a clear majority of honorable men , unless that majority be so distributed as to control the dominant party , the public is as helplessly and hopelessly at the mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost any scheme may be declared a party measure , and the anited support of the party 's membera demanded , on paiu of being denounced and politically ostracized as traitors to the party cause . That the members thus obeying the command to vote corruptly do no wrong , seems to be tacitly admitted , for by some mysterious process the caucus edict acquires the two-fold character of an absolution for sins past and an indulgence for sins to come . Ostensibly based // on the principle of majority rule , it has become a device whereby a corrupt minority may dictate the legislation of a State . If then , the cancns may be , in itself , a useful instrnment in the work of legislation , but , in its development , is fraught with so many perils to the State , what is the secret of the perversion of its proper functions ? Whence comes the power of those who wrongfully nse it to impose upon the public as they do ? When the people endnre for long a perfectly apparent abuse , it is generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That obstacle may be physical , as need of constitutional changes , or mental , as belief that the reform of the abuse involves a course of action contrary to the accepted notions of what is just . This obstacle , it is repeated , may be real or fancied , and in the case before us it is wholly fanciful , although it undeniably has a strong hold on the mind of the average man . The true source of the evil is the fallacious assumption that there is binding force in a caucus edict , considered simply as such . It is the doctrine that a reasonable man must submissively acquiesce in the resolve of a caucus , however distasteful to himself , just as a good citizen must unresistingly obey a law when finally enacted , no matter how unwise it may seem to him to be . All the authority of a final act of the law-making power of the State is , so to say , superposed on the act of a voluntary assembly , unl*nown to the law , and the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places at the point where , by the completed act of legislation , public opinion " organically passes into public will " - is transferred to the point where a body of citizens , acting in a private capacity , decide upon a certain course to be pursued in the steps that lead up to the declaration of that public will . It is thus sought to stamp the incident with the character and attributes of the principal . Where the law has left perfect freedom of action , the caucus dictum would impose the most rigorous restraint . Unconsciously almost , men have come to acquiese in the unwarranted claims of the advocates of this system , and its sway is becoming more and more despotic . It is easy to see what line of argument has led to this general acquiescence . It is insisted that when men go // into a caucus , there is an implied agreement , honorably binding upon all , that each will stand to and abide by the decision of the majority ; that since each expects submission of the others , should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each is in honor bound to give a like submission , when that decision is contrary to his own wishes . The claim is very plausibly made that unless the binding force of the caucus decision shall be recognized , party discipline will become impossible , and efforts to effectuate party policy will be rendered futile . If a man will not be bound by a caucus , it is said , he should not enter it , and if he does so enter it , and afterwards refuses to obey its decrees , he is guilty of a gross breach of faith . Each man can not have his own individual choice , either of men or measures , and unless party strength is to be frittered away , some agreement must be reached before the time for final action arrives . If at such a time , one or more dissatisfied members may refuse to stand by that agreement , such dissentients , in effect , assume to tyrannize over their more numerous associates , and the rule of the minority is the result . Such , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the caucus and it may be frankly admitted , that , properly understood , they are , in the main , sound . But they are being continually stretched beyond their legitimate bounds . The claim that a caucus decree is binding , simply because it is the decree of a caucus , is a mischievous , a dangerous fallacy . A caucus oversteps the proper limits of its functions , when it ceases to be a conference , into which free men enter and from which free men depart . As a conference of men having a similarity of views , aiming at substantially the same end by slightly different ways , it becomes a most important means of harmonizing minor differences , and of securing general support to the nearest practical realization of the slightly variant desires of all who participate . Such a conference , if fairly conducted , will generally deserve , and as generally receive the adherence of all the participants . No stronger coercive force will be required than the force of opinion that will always condemn a man who acts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abide by a decision thus rendered , when differences are matters of detail or practical // policy , rather than of principle , would soon lose all influence and consequently , all power . The public when directly appealed to , and correctly informed , would always compel obedience to what is fair and reasonable in such matters and probably would go even further than that . No artificial doctrine need be disseminated to secure popular support to the idea of unity of action . Public impatience of results constantly tends to restrict the independence of the representative . It may be freely conceded that there are occasions when decisions of a caucus are honorably binding on men . No one will deny that we often condemn a man for refusing to cooperate with his associates in support of their formulated policy . But the obligation on the one hand , and the censure on the other , are not due merely to the fact that a certain number of legislators have pronounced in favor of a certain line of action . A still greater number might favor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no magic power in the support of numbers to make that obligatory which , in the absence of such support , we should feel bound to reject . There must be some better reason than this for the authority of a caucus , when we grant that it does exist . Of necessity there can be no fixed standard but circumstances must** control . The binding power of a caucus over the acts of a reasonable man arises from the fact that it has been fairly conducted , that its conclusions are results , fairly arrived at , of a comparison of views by those taking part , and that the subject matter is such that the caucus may properly undertake to decide . Every fair minded man would feel bound by the decision of such a conference or caucus , not merely because it is the vote of a numerical majority , but because it is the fairly evolved judgment of that majoritya judgment he is bound to respect . If as a matter of fact there has been unfairness , if there has been a deliberately designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resort has been had to a caucus for the sole purpose of coercing the support of the minority for a measure to which they are known , on principle , to be opposed , then are participants not only freed from all obligation to submit , but they are in honor // bound to resist . Fraud , deception , or coercion will vitiate any compact in law and it would be a strange perversion of morals that would reverse this rule in the creation of the law itself . Matters of bona ftde party policy may not improperly be made the subject of conference . The selection of a person for a position at the disposal of the party may , perhaps , be advantageously made in the same way . But to call the members of a party together , to lay before them a measure that was not even before the people when they were elected , and by a majority vote to compel the minority to support it , when it is well known that , if left free to act , they would oppose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increasingly frequent resort to this latter course , that the chief evils of the caucus system have sprung . This practice is adopted for the purpose of forestalling opposition , and is a gross fraud upon the public . It silences all protest and avoids the inconvenience of defense . " The caucus has said it " is the ever ready answer for one so rash as to remonstrate . It prevents the union of the minority of the body with a portion of the majority in opposition to measures destructive of the public good . It deprives the State of the votes of the representatives of virtuous constituencies and transfers their votes to the control of constituencies given over to debauchery and vice . It holds out inducement to organized corruption to concentrate effort on a few districts , making but a minority of the whole , with the practical assurance of controlling the entire law-making body . It has resulted , in more than one instance , in selfish greed striding with insolent defiance of public opinion through the capitol of the State . No one can rightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a caucus . If after the whole subject has been canvassed , if after due weight has been given to the views of others , a representative feels that lie would be bound to vote against a measure , should no caucus decision be reached , he is equally bound to oppose it , no matter what the caucus decision may be . The simple test is whether his opposition is the result of personal pique , or is due to adherence to principle . Personal considerations would seldom justify him , public considerations always will . // When the London clergy met to consider whether they should bow to the order of the King in Council and read the Declaration of Indulgence in their churches , we are told that a majority favored obedience to the King . Dr. Edward Fowler , who was one of the minority , said : " I must be plain . The question is so simple that argument can throw no new light upon it and can only beget heat . Let every man say , yes or no . But I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority . I shall be sorry to cause a breech of unity . But this Declaration , I can not in conscience read . " This threat to " bolt a caucus " was made two hundred years ago , and was followed by such results that it alone should forever settle the question of the moral right and duty of a man to obey his conscience rather than the vote of his associates . The majority yielded , the Declaration was not read , the bishops followed in the footsteps of the clergy , and were in consequence imprisoned , tried , and acquitted ; their arrest and trial precipitated the calling of the Prince of Orange to the Kingdom and the consequent constitutional establishment of the civil liberties of the English speaking race . Will any one be so rash as to condemn Dr. Fowler ? And yet if the excuses of our modern betrayers of public trust are to be accepted , he must be condemned . In all essentials that memorable meeting was a caucus , but history will bear witness that Dr. Fowler and his followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed the pusillanimous voice of the majority . When a representative accepts his trust , he undertakes to legislate for the benefit of time whole State and no artificial device can absolve him from that duty . He can not justify himself by the plea that the caucus directed his vote . His only justification must be that the direction of the caucus was right , that to have disregarded it would have done the State-not himself or his party-harm . To this test he must be rigorously held or representative responsibility will become as completely a vaporous relic of the past as the divine right of kings . We must have direct relations between the representative and hi* constituents . Since his action affects the people there should be some good reason given for his act . If no reason can be given , then should he be condemned and disgraced . From the time that he assumes the // April , badge of office until he surrenders it again , from the time a law is proposed until the moment the final vote is t*aken , he is bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to legislate for the benefit of the State . A system , such as the caucus system , must justify itself by results . Refined speculations on the duty of submission can have no weight in the face of fruits already known and tendencies but too clearly manifest . To detail instances of evil would be a waste of space , but two contemporary examples of the demoralizing effects of blind obedience to caucus may be referred to . They are furnished by the two adjoining States of iRepublican Pennsylvania and Democratic New Jersey . In the former State , but recently , the power of the caucus was signalized by the election as United States Senator-in defiance of an expression of popular opinion such as would have forced the British House of Lords to yield-of a man who stands preis*minently as a representative for the worst phases of bossism , for cringing servility , for degradation of manhood , and for the boycotting of character and ability in politics , while , in the latter , as these words are being written , the tyranny of caucus is forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one branch of the judiciary , into pabulum for the spoilman 's hungry maw . Members support such measures who would not dare vote for them were they not stamped with the caucus trademark . They would not even attempt to justify their votes if cast upon their own responsibility . Surprised and indignant constituencies are quieted by the explanation that the laws were " caucus measures " and to have voted against an outrageous scheme in caucus is audaciously given , and meekly accepted , as ample vindication of the representative who afterward makes it a law by his vote . Of course the brave representative would have preferred to oppose it , but the caucus said otherwise . What right the caucus had to say so , what right he had to disregard the oath he took to throw aside his character of representative and to ignore the public weal , is not stated , and , most deplorable of all , is not even asked . The fact that the claim of authoritative force made in behalf of a caucus ruling is so generally acquiesced in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // public officers do wrong we may be angry , when they try to justify their action we may become indignant , but when such an attempted justification is accepted by the populace as sufficient , we may well begin to despair . This disposition to look upon the whole matter as beyond the power of the public to demand redress will be artfully stimulated , and there is danger that it may , like the absurd English Tory doctrine of non-resistance , . become so thoroughly ingrained that nothing but the grossest and long continued misuse of power will stir the masses to the point of throwing off their self-abasement . We may pass by instances of accomplished evil legislation , due solely to the protection against popular condemnation afforded by the superstitious reverence for the authority of a caucus , and consider whither we are drifting . Herein lies the chief danger to our institutions . It is not the ills we have , but the ills we know not yet by experience , that we need most to fear . Present evils are bad enough , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are inviting all the evils of secret legislation . It is becoming more and more common , that measures which would call forth the severest criticism are passed upon in the caucus before coming before the legislative body , and when they emerge from the secret chamber , the work of legislation is practically completed . The passage through the public chamber becomes as much a dead formality as the assent of the British sovereign to a parliamentary enactment . Argument , when offered , falls on deaf ears , and appeals to patriotism are made to men as stolid as a sphinx . Public debate thus becomes an impossibility , and the ordinary functions of the legislature a practical nullity . Responsibility is shifted to the unknown and unknowable majority of the caucus , and the honorable member , without whose vote the mischief could not have been done , lifts up his hands with virtuous indignation and exclaims : " Thou canst not say I did it . " That our legislatures will grow more and more corrupt under such a system is as certain as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the House of Commons grew steadily in corruption , while the other branches of the public service , under a system of publicity , as steadily improved in honesty . When secrecy was abolished , improvement in the // House of Commons began . We are , therefore , by means of an extra-legal tribunal , retracing the steps of parliamer*tary ref onn . We are traveling backward over the road along which our fathers came out of the wilderness of unrestrained parliamentary corruption , into the promised land of comparative legislative honesty . We are sparing the venal from all necessity of exhibiting their venality in public , and are freeing the nominally honest from all obligation to make their honesty count for the public good . We permit a blending of the people 's and the spoilsman 's representatives , but contrary to the law of confusion of goods , we let those who wrongfully do the mingling claim and take the whole . Under such a system , good government will , indeed , become an " iridescent dream . " Publicity is essential to the successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dr. Lieber in his work on Civil Liberty and Self-Government , " in connection with civil liberty , means publicity in the transactions of the business of the public in all its branches-publicity in the great process by which public opinion passes over into public will , which is legislation ; " and again he says : " In free countries political matters relate to the people , and therefore ought to be public . Publicity informs of public matters ; it teaches and educates , and it binds together . There is no patriotism without publicity , and though publicity can not always prevent mischief , if is at all events an alarm-bell , which calls public attention to the spot of danger . In former times , secrecywas considered indispensable in public matters ; it is still so where cabinet policy is preserved , or monarchical absolutism sways . " Absolutism and secrecy would seem to be inseparably connected in governments or in parties , and in truth our binding secret caucus system is developing something closely akin to monarchical absolutism . Our modern political boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receives the most abject submission , the most servile homage , from his followers , and cares nothing for public opinion so long as his overthrow does not impend . Party absolutism or bossism , as we style it , is no less galling than government absolutism , for by the intervention of the caucus , and the sustaining power of patronage , the mandate of the boss becomes the policy of the // State . " So thoroughly is publicity now ingrained in the American and Englishman , " says Dr. Lieber , " that a suppression of this precious principle can not even be conceived of . if any serious attempt be made to carry out the existing law in England , and the public were really excluded from the House of Commons , a revolution would unquestionably be the consequence , and publicity would be added to the declaration of rights . We can no more imagine England or the United States without the reporting newspaper than nature without the principle of vegetation . " These words of Dr. Lieber are not the extravagant products of fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , to exclude the public from the sittings of the legislature or to prevent the publication of the reports of its proceedings . And yet , with characteristic inconsistency , we permit practically the same thing . We permit the work of legislation , on such matters as individuals may choose to select , to be removed from the legislative hall and to be performed in a body from which the public is excluded , and in which no reporting newspaper may have a representative . What reports we do receive are given as a matter of grace or come as a betrayal of confidence  --  a most unsatisfactory kind of publicity , surely . Without a murmur we let them take the substance , but should probably rise in insurrection were they to deprive us of the shado ' * . Why then will the people permit without resistance , almost without protest . that to be done indirectly which would cause a revolution if done directly ? The reason has already been given . It is because they are cajoled by the false assumption of the morally binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that rule may be . This false education of the public mind is the spoilsman ' s opportunity . If we would loosen his grip we must inculcate more rational ideas . The true relation between representative andconstituent must become more generally understood . The people must be taught to treat this matter of official duty and official responsibility seriously , to apply the same standards they recognize in private affairs , and to cease accepting , with childlike docility , explanations and apologies that are at once a reflection on their intelligence and an insult to their manhood . // The representative must be made to understand that the people care not under whose direction he acted or with whom he conferred , but that his acts and his vote are the test by which he will be judged , and that unless he can give an honest reason for his course , he can no longer enjoy the respect of his fellows . It must be made . clear to all that the caucus concerns only the representative and his associates , but that his constituents will deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no mediator to shield him from the penalty for his shortcomings . There must be a call for simple honesty and straightforwardness in the discharge of a public trust . When this shall become the attitude of the people , when public sentiment shall demand merely the same degree of faithfulness in public affairs that is required in the business relations of life , then not onjy will the work of political regeneration have begun , but it will already be more than half accomplished . For the key to all successful reform in politics is the ignoring of artificial difficulties ingeniously held out to befog the public mind , and to prevent the untrammeled exercise of common sense .
