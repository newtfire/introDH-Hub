The chronology chided the 65-year-old Archbishop for putting the onus for the disciplinary action on the Vatican and for " portraying this whole process as a one-sided affair . " It said that by last year the Archbishop " understood that the Holy See considered him lacking the firmness necessary to govern the archdiocese. " // In a move that stirred a national debate in the Roman Catholic church , Archbishop Hunthausen was forced early in September to relinquish authority in five key pastoral areas to an auxiliary bishop . This followed a two-year inquiry ordered by the Vatican into charges that liberal practices were being tolerated in the archdiocese . The conclusions of the inquiry were officially disclosed only in vague terms. // // He Is Reported to Be Upset // In a statement yesterday , the Archbishop said his understanding of a number of the interpretations and conclusions set forth in the chronology " differs significantly from " the Vatican ' s . Described by officials close to him as " upset by the tone of the documents , " the Archbishop said he would reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual meeting next month in Washington of the nation ' s 300 Roman Catholic bishops . The Hunthausen affair will be discussed there in a closed session. // The Vatican ' s action was taken in a letter to each bishop , several of whom have publicly complained that the removal of Archbishop Hunthausen ' s authority was unfairly handled and reminiscent of repressive eras in the church ' s history. // The action reflects continuing tension between the American church , with its emphasis on diversity and democratic values , and a hierarchical-minded Vatican seeking to control what it perceives as an excess of doctrinal aberrations . <> <> Written by the Pro-Nuncio // The chronology was written by the Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States , Archbishop Pio Laghi , at the authorization of the Vatican and mailed by Bishop James W. Malone of Youngstown , president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. // The chronology says that the Seattle Archdiocese , under Archbishop Hunthausen ' s leadership since 1975 , did these things : // * Permitted contraceptive sterilizations in Catholic hospitals. // * Misapplied the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Catholics to receive communion at mass and Catholics to receive communion at Protestant services. // * Allowed the regular use of a general absolution of sins rather than individual confessions. // * Permitted affiliations with homosexual groups that promoted doctrines violating church teachings. // * Employed former priests in teaching positions and in liturgical functions " contrary to the directives of the Holy See. " // * Provided courses for priests and candidates for the priesthood which were not " firmly rooted in sound theology . " <> <> More Detail but No Cases // The chronology was far more detailed than previous disclosures , but it contained no specific illustrations or cases. // The chronology asserts that for more than six months Archbishop Hunthausen misinterpreteted an agreement with the Vatican reached in December that he take the initiative in authorizing the auxiliary bishop , Donald Wuerl , to supersede him . Because he did not do so , the chronology said , Archbishop Hunthausen had to be reminded of the original agreement first by Archbishop Laghi and then in an " authoritative clarification " by the Vatican. // Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed the move to supersede him as " mandated by the Vatican . " " A more precise description , " the chronology said , " would have been that this was the agreement reached between Archbishop Hunthausen and the Holy See after much discussion. " // " Regretfully , " the chronology continued , " the surprise announcement made by Archbishop Hunthausen after granting the faculties was interpreted as portraying this whole process as a one-sided affair. " // Sources close to Archbishop Hunthausen said he believed it unfair to blame him for a critical portrayal of the Vatican action when most of the criticism was a result of articles in the press . <> <> Spokesman Says It Is Unusual // Russell Shaw , a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , said the chronology had been issued because " in recent weeks many people - bishops , reporters , the general public - have repeatedly asked the question ' What did the Vatican do and why did they do it , ' and here is the answer . " He said he did not know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made public , was unprecedented . " But it is unusual , " he said. // Explaining some Vatican findings , the Rev. Michael G. Ryan , Chancellor of the Seattle Archdiocese , said that Catholic hospitals had performed contraceptive sterilizations on non-Catholics before Archbishop Hunthausen ' s arrival in 1975 and that the Archbishop had decided to study the policy for a time until he was told by Archbishop Laghi that it must end. // Father Ryan said that general absolution was permitted only at holiday masses where crowds were so large that it would be impossible for one or two priests to offer individual confessions to everyone . It was also impossible , Father Ryan said , to monitor whether all those receiving communion were Roman Catholics. // The displeasure expressed at the disciplining by such liberal bishops as Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee and Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit , an auxiliary bishop , is likely to persist despite issuance of the chronology . <> <> Priest Says It Goes On All Over // The Rev. Richard P. McBrien , a liberal theologian who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame , said " the bottom line is that whatever Archbishop Hunthausen is supposed to be punished for , is going on all over the United States. " // " You ' re going to have a solid minority of bishops raising hell " at the November meeting , he added. // The Archbishop first came to national attention several years ago when he said he would not pay a large share of his income taxes , to protest Federal spending on nuclear arms . The chronology specifically denied that that protest formed any part of the Vatican ' s investigation. // The chronology was studded with references that could embarrass the Archbishop , something regarded as uncommon in a document about a functioning archbishop. // The chronology said that the Vatican had corresponded with the Archbishop since 1978 because it had received a " high volume of complaints that were sent to Rome by priests , religious and faithful in the archdiocese . " Archbishop Hunthausen corrected some of the problems , the document stated , but " substantiated complaints nevertheless continued. " // A visitation , or inquiry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " primarily provoked by the documented responses of the Archbishop himself , " the chronology said. //
