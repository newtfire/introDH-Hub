The war-deadened French Riviera , pre-war Europe 's smartest playspot for the international set , has come back to life as the " United States Riviera Rest Area " for war-weary U.S. soldiers . The Sixth Army Group started the revival last October . By last week , 6,000 G.I.s a week were flocking into 42 luxury hotels near the sunny sands at Nice . Shortening U.S.R.R.A. to " Heaven , " they pronounced it the best thing the U.S. Army ever did . <P> They found clean clothes , clean sheets on real beds , the best French service , chamber music at lunch , tea dances , swing bands at dinner , concerts , movies , Cokes , local gin and beer . Signs grinned : ' " No Saluting . " For nothing or for a few francs , they could hire bicycles , sunbathe , play at the Lawn Tennis Club , take American Express tours in the big rolltop busses . There were canoes , pedallo boats and sloops with which to negotiate the blue Mediterranean . Most incredible of all : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them gently to bed . <P> Having Wonderful Time . A typical G.I. evening on the Riviera runs as follows : dinner at 7 , movie at 8 , then to the Angleterre 's Air Forces nightclub , where G.I.s jitterbug , watch a floor show which includes jugglers , acrobats , tap dancers . <P> Nice is strictly for G.I.s . Visiting brass hats were warned they might get informal treatment . General " Hap " Arnold , boss of the Air Forces , got it . Inspecting the town after recuperating from an attack of pneumonia , he walked past a happy G.I. Said the soldier , sticking out a friendly hand : " Name 's Brown . " Said the General , extending his own : " Mine 's Arnold . " <P> At Nice there are but three taboos : no swimming ( the Germans broke the sewer conduits running into the sea ) ; 2 ) no civilian guests above the first floor ; 3 ) no visits to Monte Carlo . The only rule : curfew at 1 a.m . <P> Set up by Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the G.I. Heaven is staffed with officers ready to do anything to make the soldier happy : they have even arranged weddings . G.I.s are charged a nominal 100 francs ( $2 ) on arrival . Outside U.S.R.R.A. a black-market dinner might cost 1,500 francs ; but on Heaven 's reservation , the customers get a millionaire 's vacation for peanuts .
