Cover Story <P> THE BUGS ARE COMING <P> The struggle between man and insects began long before the dawn of civilization , has continued without cessation to the present time , and will continue , no doubt , as long as the human race endures . We commonly think of ourselves as the lords and conquerors of nature . But insects had thoroughly mastered the world and taken full possession of it before man began the attempt . They had , consequently , all the advantage of possession of the field when the contest began , and they have disputed every step of our invasion of their original domain so persistently and successfully that we can even yet scarcely flatter ourselves that we have gained any very important advantage over them . If they want our crops , they still help themselves to them . If they wish the blood of our domestic animals , they pump it out of the veins of our cattle and our horses at their leisure and under our very eyes . If they choose to take up their abode with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we live in . We can not even protect our very persons from their annoying and pestiferous attacks , and since the world began , we have never yet exterminated-we probably shall never exterminate-so much as a single insect species . <P> This gloomy view of man 's perennial adversaries was written 60 years ago by U.S. Entomologist S.A. Forbes , but his modern counterparts would be hard pressed to find fault with it today . Despite mind-boggling advances in science and technology over the past several decades-the harnessing of nuclear energy , the mastery of space flight , the breaking of the genetic code-humankind has made little progress in its age-old battle with bugs . For a brief time after World War II , newly developed chemical pesticides gave scientists hope that the ultimate weapon against insects had been developed . Indeed , the bugs were sent temporarily into unprecedented retreat . <P> Now , however , all over the U.S. and in many areas around the globe , bugs are on the march , relentlessly not only retaking the ground so recently won by Homo sapiens but also making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as their own growing immunity to the chemicals , and benefiting further from the miscalculations and complacency of their human enemies , insects seem well on their way to fulfilling the chilling prophecy of The Hellstrom Chronicle : " If any living species is to inherit the earth , it will not be man . " <P> In the U.S. , the South American fire ant has advanced from its initial beachhead-Mobile , Ala. , in 1918-and now infests some 150 million acres in nine Southern states , injuring and sometimes killing livestock with its fiery sting and driving farm workers from the fields . Some experts believe that it will continue to press forward , adapting to cooler temperatures and inexorably moving toward both the North and the West . In forest areas , the gypsy moth , the tussock moth , the spruce budworm and the southern pine beetle are wreaking devastation on huge areas of woodland , defoliating and killing millions of valuable trees and destroying in 1975 alone enough board feet of timber to build 910,000 houses . <P> Corn borers and rootworms are attacking crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the boll weevil-between crop loss and control measures-annually costs U.S. farmers $260
