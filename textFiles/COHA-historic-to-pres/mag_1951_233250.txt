Decision Before Dawn ( 20th Century-Fox ) , like the controversial Desert Fox , goes behind enemy lines of World War II for a sympathetic view of a German soldier . But unlike Marshal Rommel , the new film 's hero is no Nazi who turned against Hitler too late and for the wrong reasons . He is a sensitive young Luftwaffe medic ( Oskar Werner ) who becomes a U.S. spy out of convictions that outweigh his queasiness at being pitted momentarily against his countrymen . <P> Adapted by Scripter Peter Viertel from George Howe 's Christopher Award-winning 1949 novel , Call It Treason , the . picture is a bang-up job of moviemaking . To tell the story of German prisoners of war who worked as U.S. spies , Director Anatole ( The Snake Pit ) Litvak goes the semi-documentary technique one better : he uses locations in 16 German cities and towns not merely as backgrounds but as living sets to re-enact the chaos of a battered , squalid Germany in the critical winter of 1945 . The canvas is broad , the detail meticulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes beneath the surface of Germany in the throes of imminent defeat . It contrasts the motives of Hero Werner ( " Fighting against my people now is fighting for them " ) and a tough Wehrmacht sergeant ( Hans Christian Blech ) who works for the Americans " because you 're winning the war . " Werner 's dangerous mission behind German lines to locate the position of a Panzer army develops into an odyssey through the German state of mind . Tormented inwardly by reminders of his old loyalties , he finds despair , spiritual decay , flickering compassion , Nazi brutishness and remnants of a severe Prussian sense of honor . <P> Decision Before Dawn mirrors these moods and mentalities in some excellent German players , notably Hildegarde Neff as a lonely derelict of war who has sunk into prostitution , O. E. Hasse as a colonel sternly loyal to his professional creed , Wilfried Seyfert as a virulent SS man . Apart from U.S. occupation troops cast as wartime G.I. 's , the only Americans in the film are Gary Merrill and Richard Base-hart , whose roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine performance by Viennese Actor Werner .
