In Helsingfors , Finland , Paavo Nurmi , monosyllabic marathoner , had his first interview with President Relander . The Finnish President , in all moments of conversational difficulty , turns to the formula of the catechism like those uncles who ask a child what he is studying , whether he loves his teacher , and so on , without listening to the answers . Chin in collar , Marathoner Nurmi stared at his hands . <P> " How did you like your stay in America ? " <P> " Good . " <P> " What impression did President Coolidge make upon you ? " <P> " Yankee . " <P> " Did n't you get tired of making records ? " <P> " No . " <P> " What did you think of sitting for a bust ? " <P> " Nothing . " <P> " What did you think of the bust ? " <P> " Very bad .
