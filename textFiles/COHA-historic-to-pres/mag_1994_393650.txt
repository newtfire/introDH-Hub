On a bright blue day in spring when the Mississippi Valley is at its most beautiful , I found myself at the potter Dan Anderson 's hillside studio , Old Poag Road Clay &; Class , across the river from St. Louis in Edwardsville , Illinois . It was a scene of parked pickup trucks and loosely organized activity as Anderson and his students unstacked the quarterly firing of his Anagama kiln . The huge kiln  --  it looks like a beached whale  --  is an integral part of the Anderson compound . I have never visited a Korean pottery village , but Anderson 's complex of buildings  --  home , studios and kiln  --  built into the side of a wooded hill and connected by wooden walkways , seems an approximation , in spirit at least . The multilevel house is contemporary , and its prominent feature is a square tower , a highly suitable personal signature . For many years a favorite source of vessel form for Anderson has been towers , specifically water towers  --  vernacular architecture that often combines the pragmatic with the playful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book of black-and-white photographs of water towers by Bernd and Hilla Becher lay on his coffee table . Anderson 's complex is integral to his major concerns in life  --  family , work and teaching . One of the two studios is a well-equipped shop for his wife , Caroline Bottom Anderson , who works in glass . The Southern Illinois University campus in Edwardsville , where Anderson has headed the ceramics department since 1970 , is just a few minutes away , and the Anderson home is always open to students . The firing of the wood-burning kiln with its labor-intensive stacking and long firing schedule , which must be carefully monitored , is part of their studies . Anderson is in his late 40s and the last few years have been productive for his career : an NEA fellowship in 1990 and his ninth Illinois Arts Council grant in 1991 ; a sold-out show of teapots last winter at the Garth Clark Gallery in New York City ; his new house and studios , which he built over seven years with the architects Randy Spur and Doug Julien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsman works hard over a long period of time , " Anderson said . " As you climb the academic ladder , you get a better deal . Academic patronage means equipment , assistants , sabbaticals-the most important influence on my work has been travel . Also , I can initiate shows with catalogues and bring outstanding ceramic artists to the university for workshops . Teaching involves a lot of time , but I 'm dedicated . It keeps me young and gives me the opportunity to take risks . " I have followed Anderson 's work since the 80s , and admire his steady , focused development and devotion to the vessel-no flights into the fashionable or trendy . His work is informed by the history of ceramics , particularly oriental wares that embody the physicality of clay and fire . But he has been conservative , slowly building from this tradition works that are uniquely his own . The earliest Anderson pots that I recall were large , wheel-thrown , lidded stoneware jars in the Korean tradition , mostly brown or tan . ( Anderson spent a sabbatical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seoul , in 1983 . ) These pots were informed by oriental folk pottery , but I wondered at the time where Anderson , who had received his M.F.A. from Cranbrook in 1970 , and was not a Korean folk potter , would go with them . His discovery of water towers  --  a forgotten architecture  --  and burial objects ( urns , Chinese bronzes and Roman sarcophagi ) as sources of form brought a breakthrough in his work . " I became fascinated with architecture , began scanning the landscape , " Anderson said . " There 's a great reunion of water towers in New York City 's SoHo and outside of Cleveland going east on the turnpike . All these forms I was interested in were architectural and figurative , but also functional and abstract . " Anderson 's teapots are combinations of forms , both wheel-thrown and handbuilt , and a play on the object 's various parts . His spouts can be smokestacks and the pot itself can be silo-shaped with a flatish , conical lid . They are becoming increasingly complex mini-versions of America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing . In these pots bulbous water towers sprout from roofs , sheds nestle next to silos , pipes connect various elements , walls are deeply ribbed to resemble rusted , corrugated factory walls . The stoneware and wood firing lend a weathered aura , but Anderson 's use of colored glazes  --  blues , purples , turquoise greens  --  enhances the playful , toylike aspect of the works . Though Anderson 's latest large pots are slab built , architectural and urnlike , evoking the architectural ceramics of Chinese tradition , many of the forms derive from buildings Anderson has photographed in various corners of the world . Again , he uses colored glazes to point up architectural detail . He has combined these pots with his fat , wheel-thrown jars , often ribbed and with conical lids ( repeated elements of Anderson 's vocabulary ) , placing them in wooden display cases to create wall pieces . Often the case will follow the form of the central , tall slab pot . Assembling five or more pots in this way is a challenge . Several of the combinations seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they work , however , relationships in color , texture and form are so established that the removal of one piece would muddle or even destroy the dialogue . I asked Anderson what his major influences have been . " I went to the University of Wisconsin in River Falls . That 's where I first took ceramics . Warren MacKenzie was only 20 miles away , and he sold his pots out of a hay wagon . He had just come back from England , and he was the pied piper in those days . It seemed to me like a possible life . In 1967 I became an apprentice to the Italian ceramist and sculptor Renato Bassoli in Milan . Being an apprentice is an old-fashioned idea , but I learned a lot . It was a great experience  --  I was introduced to Italian artists , art , food . At that juncture I decided this is what I want to do for the rest of my life . " At Cranbrook I studied with Richard DeVore . It was the late 60s and I was using photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of different directions . I learned from DeVore the importance of concentration , of self-direction . It was there that I first met Tashiko Takaezu . She had come to take care of her former teacher Maija Grotell , who for years had been the head of ceramics at Cranbrook . Toshiko and I have been friends ever since . She 's been supportive of my career . She 's an inspiration , still full of energy , still making great pots . " Although Anderson says he has always been attracted to the firing end of ceramics ( he traveled around looking at wood-burning kilns in Korea and in this country before he built his own ) , he still makes wheel-thrown utilitarian pots  --  lots of them . A spacious area above the studios is a showroom , and Anderson and his wife have a big sale every year before Christmas . " I enjoy throwing on the wheel , " Anderson said . " I see no conflict between making exhibition pots and making utilitarian pots that anyone can afford . The potters in Korea have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showroom for years , and he exhibits other craftsmen 's work as well . It brings in income . " The Andersons " living room , which reaches up to the high peaked roof of the house and centers on a huge stone-and-brick fireplace , also contains a mini museum collection of works  --  some bought , some traded  --  by leading contemporary ceramists such as Viola Frey , Robert Turner , Peter Voulkos , Betty Woodman , Ken Ferguson and Andrea Cill , to name a few . " It 's important for the students to see this work , to be welcome here , " Anderson said . " I 'm excited about the attention the vessel is receiving and I give Garth Clark credit for that . I like clay because of its history , the vast variety of ways it can be used , for its tactility and its durability . And its use functionally . Life is short . I want to live aesthetically . As far as teaching art goes , I really believe a few people can make a difference . Art encourages sensitivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fulfilling life . " <p>
