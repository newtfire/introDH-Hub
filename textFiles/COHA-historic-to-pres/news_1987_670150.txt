Most of the nation ' s major retailers reported lackluster sales for March , largely because of the late Easter season this year . The sluggish sales came as no surprise to analysts , who observed that Easter fell on March 30 last year , inflating year-earlier March sales . With the holiday falling on April 19 this year , the analysts expect a strong increase in this month ' s sales . " Although the obvious message is that sales are softening and the consumer is slowing down , we think it is more a result of the shift in the calendar this year , " said Jeffrey Edelman , retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . " You really have to look at March and April together this year . " Confirming this view , several retailers said the last week of the five-week period ended April 4 was the strongest , largely because of the beginning of the holiday shopping period . Meanwhile , the decline of the dollar and tight inventories have led to a slight reappearance of inflation in apparel prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift hit some retailers harder than others . F.W. Woolworth Co. , for example , posted a 4. 4% decline in sales from year-earlier figures . This was mainly the result of a later Easter ' s impact on the company ' s Kinney Shoe Corp. unit . " In many shoe stores , Easter can be the biggest week of the year , " said Harold Sells , chairman and chief executive officer of the New York-based retailer . Mr. Sells said April sales will be " robust , with a doubledigit gain . " Unpleasant weather in much of the nation throughout March also damped sales , analysts said . Carl Steidtmann , vice president and chief economist at Management Horizons , a retail consultant in Columbus , Ohio , noted that harsh March weather slowed down apparel sales , especially in comparison with the warmer weeks of February . " The strength of February took some ( sales ) away from March , when winter returned , " said Mr. Steidtmann . Same-store sales at New York-based J.C. Penney Co. declined 1. 5% ; at Mercantile Stores Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dayton-Hudson Corp. , based in Minneapolis , 4. 9% from last year . However , at Chicago-based Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , the nation ' s largest retailer , same-store sales increased 4% . At Ames Department Stores Inc. , based in Rocky Hill , Conn. , sales at comparable stores gained 6. 5% over yearearlier results . At Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in Bentonville , Ark. , they rose 8% . Mr. Steidtmann and industry analysts said this month ' s results  --  unimpressive as they were  --  in some cases were overstated as a result of the inflation in apparel prices , which were stable or falling last March , but have risen recently . " Higher prices make results seem better , but if you ' re looking at moving merchandise , results are not as good as they appear to be , " said Mr. Steidtmann . He added that last year the annualized rate of increase in apparel prices on the Consumer Price Index for January and February fell 4. 8% , compared with a rise of 6. 7% for the comparable months this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are seeing some inflation in apparel prices , " said Mr. Edelman . The recent sharp drop in the dollar has boosted the price of imports , increasing retailers ' costs and prices , analysts said , and tight inventories have put less pressure on companies to mark prices down . Some surveys depict consumers as optimistic , but cautiously so , about economic prospects . The University of Michigan ' s survey of consumer attitudes , for one , reports that high credit levels and low expectations of growth in personal income are restraining consumer spending . Kurt Barnard , publisher of a retail marketing newsletter , said , " This year ' s sales are competing with last year ' s March , which had Easter . But one can not ignore the underlying buying fatigue . " Fabian Linden , at the Conference Board , a New York-based research organization , said a 1986 car-buying binge " borrowed from the future " and is having some effect on spending now . Still , he said , the survey ' s indicators of consumer sentiment are higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no indication from the consumer that we ' re heading for rough times , " he said.  --  - Table Five-week March period a- ' 87 sales ' 86 sales b-% millions millions change Sears . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 , 324. 5 2 , 230. 0 + 4. 2 f-K mart . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 , 089. 4 1 , 999. 0 + 4. 5 J.C.
