American Mandate James Fiscus September 1918 . World War I nears its end in Europe , and the Ottoman Empire offers to surrender to the United States . The British , eager to keep the French out of Constantinople and the Straits , urge President Wilson to accept . A month later , a small American force steams into the Golden Horn . At the Versailles Conference , America accepts a League of Nations Mandate over Constantinople and other parts of Turkey . General of the Armies John Pershing commands American forces . Smedley Butler stood on the upper walk of the Galata Tower , the streets of Constantinople 's European district winding down the low hill to the Golden Horn and the Bosporus below him . The iron railing was hot from the late August sun . He stared east across the dark blue water of the Bosporus to the shore of Anatolia . Smoke rose from scdar , the shattered Asian suburbs of the imperial city , where Dwight Eisenhower and his company had died as Turkish Nationalists drove American troops from Asiatic Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden Horn to Stamboul , the ancient center of Constantinople . The minarets and domes of Sleyman 's great mosque were bright in the early afternoon sun , as were the slender towers of the other great mosques of the Ottoman sultans . " Will the Nationalists move more men across , General ? " The young marine second lieutenant commanding the observation post shifted nervously . " No need to . Mustafa Kemal already has an army behind us . Besides , we have the Governor General 's yacht to help . " The U.S.S. Arizona rode at anchor half a mile off the Golden Horn , her twelve 14-inch guns aiming beyond Butler to the Thracian Plain and the Nationalist army investing the city . Aft of her rear turret , an awning blazed white in the afternoon sun , shading Governor General Albert B. Fall 's reception for the allied ambassadors . Smedley handed the binoculars to the lieutenant and turned to enter the ancient stone tower . Butler 's movements revealed a wiry toughness earned from three decades ' campaigning as a marine . Explosions slapped behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . A white fountain spouted from the far side of the Arizona . Smoke , gray turning black , billowed over the ship . Shock froze Butler for an instant . " Call Army headquarters . Order Colonel Patton to full alert . " Butler was breathing heavily from his charge down the interior steps of the tower as he jumped into the rear seat of his open staff car . " Customs dock . " Smedley 's aide and Army liaison , Major Shaw , asked , " General , what 's happened ? " Shaw 's gaunt face showed his concern . Butler gripped the top of the door as the car bounced down the cobbled street . " Explosions on Arizona . Ca n't tell if the Navy blew themselves up or if the Turks are attacking . " The blast of the car 's horn forced a way though the crowd of European and Turkish pedestrians . The third and fourth stories of the stone and wooden houses loomed over the Rolls Royce as it slid around a sharp corner onto Istiklal Street . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and accelerated toward the water . * * * The explosion twisted the deck of Arizona from under John Pershing , hurling him against the aft turret . He dropped to one knee but refused to fall further . A cloud of oily smoke swept across the battleship 's fantail . Pershing pulled out a handkerchief and tied it over his nose and mouth . " Damn little good this will do . " " General Pershing , sir , are you hurt ? " The concerned face of an ensign hovered above the general . " I do n't think so , son . " Pershing stood slowly , testing his balance , feeling his sixty years . He coughed deeply , trying to clear the smoke from his lungs , but only drawing in more . " How is the ship ? " He reached to straighten his hat and found it missing . " Do n't know , sir . Captain Hahn and Admiral Kessler were both forward showing some pasha around . With the general 's permission , I must get to my station . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to starboard . Civilians attending the reception shoved past Pershing to the railing . Pershing saw an Army major who commanded the governor general 's honor guard . " Reynolds , organize the evacuation here . The Navy is busy trying to save the ship . " " Sir . " Pershing scanned the deck for Governor General Fall 's shock of white hair , seeing him far aft , surrounded by a small cordon of aides . As he neared Fall , Pershing called , " Is your launch near , Governor ? " Fall ignored Pershing , helping an American oilman toward a rope ladder recently tied to a stanchion . He turned to Pershing . " Best hurry , General . " Pershing heard a woman 's scream of , " Sally , " and turned . An American woman bent to help a girl of about five , who sat on the deck holding her leg and crying . Blood stained the hem of the child 's yellow dress . An older girl in a matching outfit clung to the woman , her eyes wide with fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and knelt by the youngest girl . " Here , let me see . " Pershing gently examined the girl 's leg , which had a slight cut . Emptiness gripped him , as he realizing the girl was only a year or two older than Mary Margaret and that the older girl was near Helen or Anne 's age , when all had burned to death before the war . He glanced up at the woman , filled by memories of Frankie , dead in the same fire . He forced himself to concentrate on the present , glad that his touch seemed to comfort the girl . " I do n't think it 's serious , Madam . " The woman looked down , fear fading as she recognized Pershing . " General , is the ship sinking ? " " Not till you 're safe . " Pershing spotted Reynolds . " Get these people to the launch , Major . " A rumbling explosion-felt through the deck more than heard-shook the massive battleship . Pershing stumbled as Arizona listed further . At the fantail , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the man slip from his hands into the arms of sailors on a local caique . He glanced at his hands , seeing the blood and blackened skin that had pealed from the sailor 's arms . Pershing wiped his hands on his uniform , trying to ignore the charred-lamb stench of burned human flesh . " General Pershing . " A Navy lieutenant , his white uniform covered in grime , saluted . " Sir , the fire 's near the forward magazine . " " Can you flood it ? " " No water pressure . Please abandon ship , General . " Pershing fought his instinct to stay , to help the wounded , knowing his command was ashore . " I 'm sorry , Lieutenant . " Pershing turned to the stern and climbed down into the steam launch , crowding onto a deck packed with sailors and a few civilians . Fall and the oil tycoon stood on the far side of the launch . The boat dropped away from the battleship on the fast current , moving out of the heavy smoke from burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel , " Get us around to the bow so we can see the damage . " The launch sliced through the calm water toward the dreadnought 's bow . The Arizona 's port side appeared undamaged , but the ship 's heavy list stabbed her 14-inch guns upward , twelve great barrels silhouetted against the sky . The launch rounded the sharp bow . The foredeck of Arizona vanished in a ball of flame that billowed above the tall masts . Pershing saw-or imagined , for he was never sure-both forward turrets lift upward before crashing back through the main deck . The shock of the explosion smashed into Pershing , knocking him into the crowd of sailors . Sound roared over him , and he raised his arms in protection against falling debris . The dreadnought shuddered and rolled . Her tall basket-weave masts dipped into the Bosporus , her guns jutting upward . The screams of crewmen flung into the sea rose above the death rattle within the armored hull . The ship vanished beneath the roiling surface . Oil carried fire across the blue water . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his single brigadier 's star snapped in the wind as Smedley leapt from his still-moving car . A growing throng of Turks and Europeans crowded the small plaza , voices raised in half a dozen languages Butler recognized , and a dozen he did n't . Black smoke rose from the burning oil marking Arizona 's grave . Smedley stared in shock at the flock of small boats circling , seeking survivors . " It only took me ten minutes to get here . Battleships should n't die that quickly . " A marine sergeant , a stocky , powerful man with gray hair and a face lined from decades of campaigning , saluted sharply . " The swabbies say Turks floated a mine to her on the current , but nobody knows , General . " " Where 's Pershing , Sergeant Cooper ? " Butler always felt rapport with Cooper , a relic of the old Marine Corps whom he remembered from the march on Peking and the Panama Battalion . " With the Governor General , I hope , sir . His launch is picking up survivors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few feet above the swiftly moving Bosporus . Four- and five-story stone and brick buildings , mainly occupied by European or local Greek-owned business , crowded the waterfront in a jumble of pastels and stonework . Behind them , buildings climbed the low hill to the medieval gray stones of the Galata Tower with its layer-cake crown of balconies . The crowd grew rapidly , and Butler 's hand brushed his holstered .45 at the thought of yet another riot sweeping the city . Smedley relaxed slightly as two trucks loaded with marines bounced to a stop . " Good timing , " Butler said . " Major Shaw , keep the promenade clear , but go easy . The city could go up like a ton of dynamite . Do n't light the match . " " I understand , sir . " Shaw saluted . " Sergeant , where 's your phone ? " Cooper pointed to a low wooden shack . " Inside , General . " Butler stepped into the small guard post , his boots clicking on the plank floor . He cranked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " General Butler here . Is the garrison on alert ? " " No , sir . Not without Colonel Patton 's orders . I 'm trying to reach him , sir . " " Where is Colonel Patton ? " " Not quite sure , sir . He 's playing a polo match against the wogs , General , over in Stamboul . " The answer came with obvious reluctance . " Civilizing them , he said . " Smedley Butler took off his broad-brimmed campaign hat for a moment and wiped sweat from his forehead with his sleeve , brushing his dark hair back , using the gesture to bring his temper under control . " Full alert . Now . Send the Army to reinforce the perimeter . " " Yes , sir . " " Marine riot squads into the streets . If the residents of Stamboul see this as a signal to attack foreigners , the sultan 's police wo n't stop them . Send every vehicle you can spare to move the wounded to hospital . " " Yes , sir , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harsh whisper as he walked from the building . " Aristocratic bastard should be on duty , not playing polo . No wonder the Turks ambushed him in Armenia . " " We finally have some ambulances , sir . " Sergeant Cooper saluted . " And the governor general 's launch just landed . " Butler glanced at the flock of aides circling Fall as he walked away from his launch . The governor general 's shock of white hair was like a flag in the center of the crowd . His voice , loud as always , carried his New Mexico drawl across the plaza . Butler pushed through the gaggle of sycophants around the governor general . " Governor Fall , was General Pershing injured ? " " Nigger Jack 's playing nurse ... " Recognizing Butler , Fall sputtered to silence , then continued , his voice petulant . His bronzed face , white hair and drooping mustache made him look like a carnival pitchman . His blue eyes were narrow and cold . " Pershing is still on my launch . Bring him to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was covered in soot and dirt . He helped a sailor , whose right leg twisted hideously at the knee , stagger to the dock . Butler took the sailor 's other arm and the two generals eased the man to a stretcher . " Glad you made it ashore , General . We were afraid you 'd been caught in the explosion . " " There were children aboard . I could not abandon them to a fire . " Pershing 's voice broke slightly as he talked . " I understand , sir , " Smedley said . " General Pershing , we must talk . Now . " Albert Fall 's drawl cut through the cries of the wounded . He indicated the tall , chunky oilman he had escorted from the sinking Arizona . " You have not met Mister Walters . He landed from the Princess Matoika yesterday to sign a new concession with the sultan 's government . We must stop the Nationalists , General . They refuse to honor the sultan 's agreements . " " Mister Walters , you will excuse us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pershing said . Fall started to object , then followed Pershing and Butler into the nearby guard shack . " General Pershing , the Army has allowed Mustafa Kemal and his followers to become an irritation . Get rid of this bandit . " " Mustafa Kemal and the Turkish Nationalists have just driven a hundred and fifty thousand Greek troops from Anatolia . He has twenty thousand of his men at our backs in European Turkey . " John Pershing 's tone made his contempt for Fall clear . " We have twenty-five hundred troops holding our perimeter and General Butler 's fifteen hundred marines holding the city . If we stay in Constantinople and the Turks attack , we die , Governor . We must evacuate . " " I give you orders , General . You do not order me , " Fall nearly shouted . " I advised President Wilson to reject this mandate . He did not . With Wilson gone , President Harding refuses to send more troops , and yet you block a diplomatic solution with Mustafa Kemal . The American Mandate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surrender American interests to a wog , " Fall said , his New Mexico drawl thicker as his voice rose again . He pulled out a cigar and lit it , not offering one to Pershing or Butler . " You do n't defend American interests , Governor . You defend American companies , " Butler said . " You ordered the sultan to revoke European oil concessions and give them to Americans . There is a price for that . The French signed a treaty with Kemal last year . The British are about to . You have isolated us from European help to defend your racket . " " We do not need Europe , General Butler . You did n't run from the Niggers in Haiti . Why do you run from the Turks ? " Fall puffed a cloud of cigar smoke into the air . Butler spun and walked to the far side of the room so as not to strike the politician . Fall 's voice rose behind him , " General Pershing , remove this man from his command . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
