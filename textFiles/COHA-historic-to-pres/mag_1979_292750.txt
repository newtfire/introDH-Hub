Neighborhood paraphernalia dealers blossomed as fast as the drug culture , flowering on corners across the nation with a wide assortment of cigarette rolling papers , small pipes , cocaine spoons , psychedelic lights and other legal appurtenances for high living . But for many officials , the head shops serve as a too-blatant reminder of the losing battle against drugs . <P> A crusade against the shops , in Westfield , Mass. , began when a horrified friend showed some pipes and smoking paraphernalia he had found in his twelve-year-old son 's bureau to City Councilor Charles Medeiros . " I had thought those things were illegal , " Medeiros said . He proposed an ordinance , which passed unanimously , requiring such stores to get licenses . Mayor Gary Lynch , who reluctantly signed the law , commented , " It strikes me as cutting off the branches instead of the roots . " <P> The head shops are banding together in mutual protection , as would members of any other $3 billion-a-year business . Says Chris Colbert , director of the <P> Paraphernalia Trade Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of stoned-out hippies carving pipes in the basement . We 're normal businessmen with shirts and ties . " The association hired a lawyer to fight Westfield 's action and won a preliminary injunction against enforcing the new ordinance . Whatever the outcome , the battle is educational . Says Medeiros : " I 'll tell you , I 've learned a lot myself . I never knew they sold orange-flavored cigarette papers . "
