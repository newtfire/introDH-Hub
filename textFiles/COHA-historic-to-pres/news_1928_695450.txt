The temptation to draw a parallel beween the Presidential election of 1828 aid the one this year is naturally great . 0/DREW JACKSON represented somehing new in American political life . . lovernor SMITH 'S friends have felt that le , also , speaks for new forces of democracy . But it is surprising to see that a tistinguished student of government and tistory , Professor WILLIAM B. MUNRO , n the October Century , carries the parMel to the point of saying that Governor SMITH represents the frontier , as did eneral JACKSON , but that his is the ' new frontier " of the twentieth century , which is not geographical but racial , lividing the newer stock from the naive  --  the frontier of the East Side . One is surprised , not that the profesmr is struck by the similarities between MTN and JACKSON , but that he projects into modern urban America a concept identified with a phase of American life that is now passed .

The newcomers have displayed many of the characteristics of the old pioneers , but under conditions so different that no parallel can be drawn . The journey of the newer immigrants from Europe was comparatively easy ; they landed among friends and kinsmen ; they settled in communities already developed by their predecessors ; they were within reach of all the advantages of a highly complex modern city ; their discomforts and hardships were not those of isolation and the wilderness , but of overcrowding . Their handicaps were as many as those of the old pioneers . But neither their problems nor their environment nor their method of life even remotely resembled the old .
