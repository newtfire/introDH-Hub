If Author Mary McCarthy , 74 , seems in the mood to celebrate herself , she has probably earned that indulgence . For some 50 years she has reigned as the irruptive dark lady of American letters , a ferocious critic of everything from theater and books to U.S. society and foreign policy ; a novelist ( The Group , The Groves of Academe ) with a reputation for settling scores by turning enemies into thinly disguised fictions . Hence , perhaps , the hint of smugness in the title she has chosen for the first volume of her projected autobiography . How I Grew has nothing to do with its subject 's physical stature . <P> Admirers of McCarthy 's works and career will not mind the hubris that opens this book ( " I was born as a mind during 1925 , my bodily birth having taken place in 1912 " ) and that keeps it moving ( " I was an intellectual by the time I reached Annie Wright ( ( Seminary ) ) . And no one else was " ) . Newcomers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's name and opinions without volunteering until the end the information that the famous critic was to be her second husband . Of the photographs that accompany the text , three include McCarthy 's younger brother Kevin , a well-known actor , who is never mentioned by name in his sister 's narrative . Those who are not already in the know about the author 's biography receive little encouragement to proceed . <P> Yet How I Grew is worth some effort , even from initiates . Beneath its self-congratulatory veneer , the story generates considerable poignancy and appeal . There is the little girl who takes a train trip from Seattle with her beloved parents to visit relatives in Minneapolis . Then her mother and father die , victims of the flu epidemic of 1918 , leaving the heroine and three younger brothers orphaned into the harsh care of an aunt and uncle : " If I was beaten with a razor-strop for having won a prize in a city-wide essay contest , I had no need to ask myself why . . . it was to keep me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it was easy to find the cause of that ; it was simply that our parents had died . " <P> After five grim years , McCarthy ( but not her brothers ) is rescued by her maternal grandparents and taken to live once again in Seattle . Her new home is spacious and comfortable . Her guardians make gentle attempts to keep the headstrong girl in check : " My grandmother had statutory ages for everything , sixteen for boys , fourteen for real , non-ribbed silk stockings , fifteen perhaps for lipstick . " These restrictions do not keep Mary from losing her virginity during her sophomore year in high school . <P> By this time she is enrolled at an Episcopal boarding school in Tacoma , and it is not sex but education that engages her most passionate interests . She realizes that her classmates are pleasant , well-to-do girls whose sights are set on making an appropriate marriage : " Our school could not maintain an elite status socially while offering anything like a serious education . " But a few dedicated teachers prep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is admitted to Vassar . McCarthy writes , " I prefer being a Puget Sound type that had gone east to college , as could happen , though rarely , to Seattle girls . "
