We met fellow passenger Darren Durbin , of Cedar City , Utah , while waiting oard a Carnival cruise from Los Angeles to the Mexican Riviera . Three hours later , we were in the ship 's candlelit , dual-purpose conference room and chapel , acting as witnesses to his wedding . <p> Passengers like Darren and Brenda Durbin are part of a growing trend . It 's new enough that industrywide statistics are n't yet available , but a few lines have kept track : During 1999 , Carnival , which has 14 ships , performed an average of just over five weddings per day . Royal Caribbean International , with 12 ships , performed an estimated three weddings per day . <p> " Now that more and more cruise lines are combining the wedding with the honeymoon , more couples are opting to run away to sea , " says James G. Godsman , president of Cruise Lines International Association , the marketing organization for the North American cruise industry . <p> " People like it because it 's one-stop shopping , " notes Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in a variety of options and prices , ranging from small , couples-only ceremonies with cake , flowers , photography , taped music and champagne toast , to a live quartet-accompanied wedding ceremony preceded by spa treatments and followed by an ice-sculpture-decorated reception . Industrywide , weddings range in price from about $ 575 ( not including photos and marriage license fees ) to about $ 2,400 . <p> " If you 're a two-career couple and you 've got a very busy lifestyle , it 's a great way to do it , because you do n't have to tie up your time with legwork . They do it all for you ! " said 44-year-old Georgina Benvenuto of Florida , who married 50-year-old Canadian Marino Benvenuto five days into a Mediterranean cruise aboard the Grand Princess last summer . <p> The Grand Princess is the first cruise ship with a dedicated wedding chapel , and the only one currently performing weddings at sea rather than in ports . <p> The Benvenutos initially wanted to marry in Venice , Italy , but nixed the idea when they found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires , among other things , declarations obtained in person at the American Consulate and at the nearest Italian Consulate , plus two visits to the relevant Marriage Office in Italy . A Roman Catholic ceremony there also requires baptismal and confirmation certificates . ) The Benvenutos decided instead to marry aboard ship less than 24 hours before the Grand Princess docked in Venice for an overnight stay . <p> Cruise lines currently offering wedding packages include American Hawaii Cruises , Cape Canaveral Cruise Line , Carnival Cruise Lines , Celebrity Cruises , Costa Cruise Lines , Holland America Line , Premier Cruises , Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean International . <p> Most require that weddings take place on the day of embarkation before departing port . In addition , cruise lines typically limit this service to several North American port cities , Bermuda and a few Caribbean destinations . <p> Carnival and Princess cruise ships on Caribbean/Panama Canal itineraries also offer land-based weddings at select ports of call . Royal Caribbean will begin offering land-based weddings in Alaska and other ports of call beginning in the spring . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship be in international waters ( 12 miles outside territorial waters ) represent the only restrictions faced by passengers marrying aboard the Grand . The Grand Princess plies the Mediterranean ( Istanbul to Barcelona ) during spring and summer , and the Eastern Caribbean during fall and winter . <p> While getting married aboard a cruise ship may seem like a cinch , sailing off into the sunset still requires some footwork . <p> Most cruise lines require a couple to obtain their own wedding license from the locale in which the marriage is performed . Except in Florida , which permits cruise lines to obtain passengers ' marriage licenses in absentia , most U.S. states plus Canada require that the couple visit the marriage bureau in person . <p> Couples wishing to wed aboard American Hawaii Cruises ' SS Independence , for example , must appear before the Marriage License Bureau in Honolulu before boarding . As that office is open only Monday through Friday and the cruise begins on Saturday , couples must incur the expense of arriving a minimum of one day early . Carnival passengers intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive before 10 a.m. one day early . <p> " In St. Thomas , the licensing procedure is so complicated , as an added service , we obtain it for them as part of the package , " LaFontisee explains , regarding Royal Caribbean International 's one exception to the line 's do-it-yourself policy . <p> According to literature supplied to prospective wedding couples by Carnival Cruise Lines , Jamaica , Barbados and Grand Cayman grant wedding applications by mail . <p> By contrast , other than personal identification , getting married aboard the Grand Princess requires no previous documentation , says Jan North , deputy purser and wedding coordinator on that ship . <p> Under Liberian law ( the Grand Princess ' registry ) , captains are legally empowered to perform weddings . Ship personnel then send the newlyweds ' witnessed and signed marriage certificate to the deputy commissioner of the Republic of Liberia in Reston , Va. , for further processing . Once it is returned to the newlyweds , the couple is responsible for registering that document with their local County Clerk 's Office ( or the equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state in the United States recognizes a valid marriage of another country if the couple meets all the requirements to be married in that country , " explains attorney Sandra Morgan Little , chairwoman of the American Bar Association 's Family Law Section . <p> As for the consequences of such a marriage on any subsequent divorce proceedings , Little notes that " as long as a couple has met the minimum residency requirements for divorcing in a particular state , then that state 's laws will apply . " If , for example , a couple were married aboard a cruise ship , resided in Chicago and eventually filed for divorce here , the state of Illinois would apply Illinois law to the divorce . <p> Couples usually have a choice of where on the ship their ceremony will be held . Despite its chapel as an option , one Grand Princess couple chose to marry on deck in front of the ship 's Web camera so friends and family could watch the ceremony on the Internet . <p> Couples on Carnival ships can marry in one of the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a Jamaican waterfall . Like the Grand Princess , Royal Caribbean 's newly launched Voyager of the Seas ( which in mid-November surpassed the Grand Princess as the world 's largest cruise ship ) also features a wedding chapel . <p> A notary public or judge usually officiates . Voyager of the Seas ' chapel offers an altar and a chuppa ( a canopy used in Jewish nuptials ) . Passengers who want a religious ceremony aboard a cruise ship typically must bring along their pastor or rabbi . <p> When a reception is involved , there may be a per-person fee for guests above a certain number . Wedding guests sometimes arrange to sail with the couple ; others leave prior to the ship 's departure . Many cruise lines also feature shipboard tuxedo rentals and sponsor a complimentary honeymooners ' reception sometime during the cruise . <p> Certain cruise lines also offer shipboard vow renewals , ranging from free group ceremonies on American Hawaiian Cruises ' SS Independence to individually performed renewals at $ 595 per couple on Carnival 's ships . <p> Crystal Cruises charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vow renewal ceremony ; the fee includes flowers , cake , a portrait and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne . Holland America 's Caribbean-bound passengers can renew their vows in a chapel located on a private island ( $ 95 ; group vow renewals only ) . <p> While lacking in legal ramification , this burgeoning trend is a reflection of at least one popular perception : There 's nothing more romantic than a cruise . <p> Ellen B.
