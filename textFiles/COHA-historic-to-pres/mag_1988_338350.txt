It is morning in Moscow , and a conspicuously important visitor , his face half hidden by a fedora , walks into one of the city 's factories . He strides up to a worker and introduces himself : " I 'm Mikhail Gorbachev . " <P> " Oh ! " the worker replies . " I did n't recognize you without your wife . " <P> Not since Czar Nicholas wed Alexandra in 1894 have Russians encountered a ruler 's wife with such presence , such personality , such promise as a subject of mild jokes and elevated eyebrows as Raisa Gorbachev . She is the first spouse of a Soviet leader to weigh less than he does , acid tongues have it in Moscow , and the first " Czarina , " as some of her fellow citizens mock her , to appear in the Kremlin since the fall of the Romanovs . She is also the first Soviet First Lady to use an American Express card and , as a member of the board of the Culture Fund , the first since Lenin 's wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sharp tongue and relatively lavish habits are the talk of Moscow . Almost from the day in 1985 when her husband took over as General Secretary of the Communist Party , Raisa Gorbachev has been one of the most visible , most gossiped-about females in the country . <P> What a change ! For decades , while Soviet leaders went about the business of state , their spouses remained virtually invisible . The wives of Stalin , Khrushchev , Brezhnev and Chernenko rarely appeared in public . It was not known for sure that Yuri Andropov even had a wife until she showed up to mourn him at his 1984 funeral . <P> Now , suddenly , there is Mikhail and Raisa , a pair who can hold their own in the international journalistic sweepstakes vis-a-vis Ron and Nancy and , given the Gorbachevs ' comparative youth ( he is 57 , she 56 ) and the Soviet political system , who will probably outlast George and Barbara or Mike and Kitty . The Western press trembles with anticipation . <P> Raisa . Even in this semienlightened age , prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cory , Nancy . Yet , despite her visibility , Raisa Gorbachev remains a riddle inside an enigma wrapped in sable . Is she the witty , cosmopolitan muse of glasnost , as some Westerners who have met her suggest ? Or is she a hard-line ideologue , as others report ? At a dinner with the Reagans during the 1985 Geneva summit , Raisa launched into a lengthy and pedantic monologue on Soviet policy . After the Gorbachevs left , Nancy Reagan may have spoken for the other guests when she fumed , within hearing of then White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan , " Who does that dame think she is ? " <P> There seem to be several Raisas . Most prominent these days is the " Nemesis of Nancy . " The First Ladies ' little cold war has been the stuff of tabloid headlines ever since Mrs. Gorbachev upstaged Mrs. Reagan by arriving unexpectedly at the 1986 Reykjavik summit ( Nancy stayed home ) . " I missed you in Reykjavik , " Raisa said when the two met in Washington last December . Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited . "
