THE temperament of Cornish land- scape has many moods and will fit into no formula , To-day I have spent the most flawless day of any summer I can remember , on the sands of Kennack Bay , at the edge of that valley in Cornwall which I have written about in these pages . Sea and sky were like opals , with something in them of the color of absinthe ; and there was a bloom like the bloom on grapes over all the outlines of cliff and moorland , the steep rocks glowing in the sunshine with a warm and rich and soft and colored darkness . Every outline was distinct , yet all fell into a sort of harmony , which was at once voluptuous and reticent . The air was like incense and the sun like fire , and the whole atmosphere and aspect of things seemed to pass into a kind of happy ecstasy . T-Tore , all nature seemed good ; yet , in that other part of Cornwall from which I have but just come , the region of the Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes , in a world of granite rocks that are fantastic by day , but by night become ominous and uncouth , like the halls of giants , with giants sitting in every doorway , erect and unbowed , watching against the piratical onslaughts of the sea . About the Land 's End the land is bare , harsh , and scarred ; here and there are fields of stunted grass , stony , and hedged with low hedges of bare stones , like the fields of Galway ; and , for the rest , haggard downs of flowerless heather , sown with gray rocks , and gashed with lean patches through which the naked soil shows black . The cliffs are of granite , and go down sheer into the sea , naked , or thinly clad with lichen , gray , green , and occasionally orange ; they are built up with great blocks and columns , or stacked together in tiers , fitted and clamped like cyclopean architecture ; or climb rock by rock , leaning inwards , or lean outward , rock poised upon rock , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are heaped into altars , massed into thrones , carved by the sea into fantastic shapes of men and animals ; they are like castles and like knights in armor ; they are split and stained , like bulwarks of rusty iron , blackened with age and water ; they are like the hulls of old battleships , not too old to be impregnable ; and they have human names and the names of beasts . They nod and peer with human heads and wigs , open sharks ' fangs out of the water , strut and poise with an uncouth mockery of motion , and are as if mysteriously and menacingly alive . This is the land of giants : there is the Giant 's Chair at Tol-Pedn , and the Giant 's Pulpit at Boscawen , and the Giant 's Foot at Tolcarne , and the Giant 's nand on Carn Brea . And there is a medieval humor in Cornish legends which still plays freakishly with the devil and with the saints . Here , more than anywhere in Cornwall , I can understand the temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible images of popular beliefs : the Satanic humor , the play of giants , the goblin gambols of the spirits of the earth and of the sea . The scenery here is not sublime , nor is it exquisite , as in other parts of the county ; but it has a gross earthly gayety , as of Nature untamed and uncouth ; a rough playmate , without pity or unkindness , wild , boisterous , and laughing . There is an eerie laughter along these coasts , which seem made not only for the wreckers who bloodied them , and for the witches whose rocky chairs are shown you , where they sat brewing tempests , but for the tormented and ridiculous roarings of Tregeagle and the elemental monsters . In this remote , rocky , and barren land there is an essential solitude , which nothing , not the hotel , nor the coming and going of people in the middle of the day , can disturb . Whenever I get right out to the last point of rocks , where one looks straight down , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chafing water , I feel at once alone and secure , like a bird in a cleft of the rock . There is the restfulness of space , the noise of sea-birds and the sea , and nothing else but silence . The sea-gulls cry and laugh night and day ; night and day you hear the sea crying and laughing ; sails and smoke pass on the sea , this side and that side of the T.ongships lighthouse , which stands , beautiful and friendly , on the reef in the water ; and along the land , at morning and evening , nothing moves , all is waste , wide , and silent . Little brown donkeys start up among the rocks as you walk across the cliffs at night ; fat slugs lie in the way of your feet , black and burnished as coal ; you see a vague movement , gray upon gray , and it is " the slow , soft toads , " panting and leaping upon the stones . In this solitude , away from the people of cities , one learns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sense of reality and of relationship . We are hedged in from the direct agency of the elements ; we are hardly conscious of the seasons but for their discomforts ; we are in the midst of manufactured things , and might forget that bread grew in the ground and that water existed except in pipes and cisterns . And the moment we leave the city we come to remember again that men and women are not alone in the world , but have countless living creatures about them , not pets nor beasts of burden , and with as much right to the earth and sunlight . First , there is the life of the fields and the farmyards , a life attendant on ours , but familiar with us while we spare it . Then there is the unlimited life of birds , who , in these regions , have foothold in the sea as well as on land , and have two provinces , of water and of air , to be at home in . And , besides these , there is the tiny restless life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bees with their polished mahogany backs and soft buzz that they call here " dummlederries , " and that come out in the evening , the toads and slugs that come with the first dark , andthe glowworms that light their little lonely candle of pale gold at night . The world suddenly becomes full of living beings , whose apparent happiness we are glad to be permitted to share . In this air , in this region , an air of dreams , a region at once formidable and mysterious , every hour of the day has its own charm and character , which change visibly and in surprising ways . This morning was impenetrable with mist , and the lighthouse guns were firing until an hour after sunrise ; grayness blotted out the whole sea . At last the brown reef of the lighthouse could be distinguished , but not the lighthouse ; and then , suddenly , as one looked away and looked hack again , there was a white , shining column , like a column of marble , glittering through the mist . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock , I walked through wet vapors , soft , enveloping , and delicious . The mist faded and returned , showing one , in glimpses and under dripping veils , headland after headland , rivalling each other in boldness , in architecture of strangely shaped and strangely poised rocks , hare , splintered , crimped at the edges , cut into ladders , sheared into caverns , sundered by chasms , heaped crag upon crag with a romantic splendor . Now and then the path dropped to a little bay of white sand , and in the fishing-creek of Porthgwarra I met a little Italian boy with a concertina , who was quite alone , and spoke no English . and smiled with complete happiness , though shyly , as he told me that he did nothing , nothing . At St. Levan I saw the little church , hidden in a hollow , with its beautiful and elaborate wood-carving , a whole monkish symbolism of bold fancy , and , in the churchyard , the single grave where the fragments of fifteen men , lost in the Khyber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two heads , and one whole man , a Japanese ; and , near the new grave , the old Levan Stone of splintered granite , with grass growing in the gap , of which the people say : The moorlands , in from the cliff , are all desolate , covered with short grass and heather , strewn with gray rocks , and cut into square patterns by stone hedges . About the Logan the shapes of the rocks become less grotesque , seem less strangely artificial ; and the Logan point is like a house of rocks , chamber beyond chamber , with its corridors , doorways , and windows . At midday I liked to go to Sennen Cove , because the sand there is whiter than any other sand , and the green slope above the sand more delicately green , and the water bluer and more glowing . At high tide the water comes in with arejoicing exuberance , as if drawing into itself all the violence of the sun . It is exquisite , on a breathless July day about noon , to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal in the sun , watching the painted sea , throbbing with heat , purple , grape-colored , stained with the shadows of clouds and rocks ; ' seeing the steamers pass as the clouds pass , with no more human significance ; curious of nothing in the world but of the order and succession of the waves , their diligence , and when the next wave will obliterate the last wave-mark . Twilight comes on most exquisitely , I think , over the cliffs towards Pardennick ( the headland that Turner painted ) , looking down on Enys Dodman , the bare brown rock sheared off and pierced through by the sea , which is the loudest home of seagulls on the coast . There are rocky headlands to right and left , and that rock in the sea which they call the Armed Knight , but which to me seems like one of the Rhine castles , stands there , romantic and spectacular , not like any work of nature . Beyond , with the twilight-colored sea around it , is the lighthouse , like a red star alighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Wolf , and the two lights of Scilly . The sky , where the sun has gone down , is barred with dark lines and halfobscured outlines , like the outlines of trees seen in some shadowy mirror . Faint stains of gold and green and pink remain in the sky , still bright , and yet softened as if seen through water . Opposite , the moon has risen , and hangs in the sky , round and white ; the sea darkens and shines , with strange glimmerings and dim banks of shadow , under the two lights from east and from west . There is one boat on the sea : I see the two brown sails , and their shadows in the water . From the island of the sea-gulls there is a continual harking and chattering , as they walk to and fro , or stand and shout against the land . The rock darkens , and the white birds shine like white lilies growing out of brown earth . The castle in the sea turns black , and every peak and spire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a magic castle , Klingsor 's perhaps ; or perhaps the last throne and ultimate stronghold of the night . Here at the Land 's End one is enveloped by water . The hotel , where I have been so well and so quietly served , so much alone when the breaks and mo- tors ci not come in to spoil some of the middle hours of the day , is built on the farthest habitable peak of land , and from my window 1 looked straight down into the sea , which I could see from horizon to horizon . Nothing was around me but naked land , nothing in front of me but a brief foothold of rocky cliff , and then the whole sea . For the first time in my life I could satiate my eyes with the sea . In the country , between the grass and the sky , one may taste a measure of happiness , and the sight may be refreshed , rested , healed of many evils . But it is as if one ate good food without drinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the eyes drink the sea . Is it not because it is always moving , and because one is not moving with it , that the sea means so much more to one than any possible inland scenery ? A tree , a meadow , though it grows and changes , grows and changes imperceptibly ; I can not see it in motion : it seems to he always there , irritatingly immobile . But the sea is always moving past me ; it is like a friend who comes and goes and is faithful ; its motion is all I have to give me some sense of permanency in a world where all things grow old and pass away , except the sea . Byron was right , though he spoke pompously : " Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow . " Every part of the earth 's body is growing old , and shows the signs and scars of age ; only the sea is without that symptom of mortality , and remains a witness to the original youth of creation . And the land too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this height , one seems to stand among fragments of the making of the world ; and , at so few hundred yards from the hotel , the teahouse , the picture post-cards , the breaks , and the motors , to be cut off from all these things by an impregnable barrier ; alone , at the edge or the world , with the immovable rocks , and with the sea which is always moving and never removed .
