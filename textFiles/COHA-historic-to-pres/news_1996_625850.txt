SUPPOSE , fantastically , that the bombast and belligerence in the confrontation between a Democratic president and the Republican Congress actually eventuates in a balanced budget by 2002 . Huzza ! That roach will then have been squashed . <p> But just around the corner lurks a money-eating dragon , and not one of the most prominent statesmen in the current set-to has so much as muttered a word about how this fearsome creature is poised to gobble up the nation 's bounty . <p> The threat is Social Security , the biggest , most beloved , politically sacred entitlement program of them all , even ahead of Medicare , which President Clinton has now enshrined as politically untouchable . While Social Security has served the nation well since it was created in the New Deal , the coming century will see it grow to the point where it could chomp on us ravenously and insatiably , to the utter detriment of our other justifiable ends . <p> Pushing the program into the yawning jaws of catastrophe is quite a crowd , that oversized portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies anymore . Born in the decades after eager American soldiers returned home from World War II duties , the first ones started turning 50 this year . By 2030 they will have doubled the ranks of the retired from 42.5 million today to 84.5 million . <p> Right now , even if they do n't exactly know it , 3.1 working people support one Social Security recipient through money transferred from payroll taxes , quite a change from the 20 workers supporting one recipient in 1945 . Come 2030 , the ratio will change to 1.8 workers per recipient . By then , working citizens would have to pay 60 percent or 70 percent of their income in federal taxes to keep Social Security and the rest of government more or less intact . <p> What to do ? Well , benefits could be cut by 30 percent . Those congressmen who have their running shoes tied on tight might try to get by with such a reduction , though they would probably glance first at another prospect , hiking the payroll tax ( 6.2 percent per employee for Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 18 percent . Either of these alternatives , or some combination of the two , might dampen the crisis , though just temporarily . It also would consign to electoral oblivion any congressman brash enough to propose them , and deservedly so , seeing that there is another , better way out . <p> This solution could convert the Social Security dragon into one of the best friends the American economy has ever had . It would not only fund Social Security , it would convert virtually all American citizens into stockholders and owners of our corporations ; it would create the capital to finance hundreds of thousands of new job-fostering enterprises ; and it just might , in time , create 100 million millionaires out of American workers , some of whom are only minimum-wage earners . <p> The answer is gradually to switch from a pay-as-you-go , tax-and-spend transfer and welfare program , to a true savings and investment program , and to a private-public partnership . <p> Politically , snarl-lipped difficulties reside in this territory , too . Recipients and those who lobby on their behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let alone so major a change , and those on the political left are automatically suspicious when it looks like somebody , somewhere might have the effrontery to serve the public good and simultaneously make a profit . But when you listen to the likes of Sam Beard of New York City , the intimidation of doing what 's right and rational begins to fade . <p> Beard , who counts himself a Democrat and once worked for Sen. Robert Kennedy , does not come at this issue as a right-leaning privatizing enthusiast , but as someone who , for four presidents , has tried to create jobs through his nonprofit National Development Council . He understands the need for capital to create work opportunities , he is disturbed at inequities in income distribution and he sees a way to fix these problems and to fix Social Security , too . <p> Here , basically , is how his plan would work . There would be a selected number of private finance managers , overseen and regulated by a government corporation . When people entered the work force , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These companies would invest the money in your account , providing extraordinary capital for new and old businesses . At retirement age , you would have the savings , plus earnings and interest , available to you . It 's your money . Tax-free , you could pass on to your survivors any portion you had not yet collected . <p> The toughest nut to crack is the transition from where we are now to where Beard wants to go , and part of what distinguishes Beard from others advocating similar programs is that he has come up with what seems a workable plan . The program needs to start soon , within the next five years or so , to accumulate enough to take care of the baby-boomer recipients whose numbers start to swell significantly by 2010 and then continue to mushroom through 2030 . Meanwhile , ways must be found to take care of those who paid their payroll taxes but did not have time to earn much , if anything , through private investments . <p> Beard 's plan calls for a two-tier system , one funded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes as now . Workers would start by putting roughly half their money into the private investments and half into the public program . Increasing amounts would go into the private program over time , while the public tier would be gradually whittled down , eventually serving primarily as a safety net and to take care of the disabled and dependents of deceased workers . <p> There still would be a shortfall . It could be partially met by returning surpluses borrowed from the Social Security Trust Fund for other governmental purposes and making sure surpluses were never borrowed again . Raising the retirement age for full benefits to 70 by 2029 would help . Congress also could increase the tax amount contributed to the public fund by 2 percentage points , but Beard has a better idea . Some 20 percent of recipients do n't need Social Security to live comfortably in their retirement . Allow them to buy Liberty Bonds with the amount that 's due them and give the bonds tax-free to their children , grandchildren or anyone else they like . The only proviso would be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Beard has spent 1,500 hours with actuaries figuring out his numbers , and he is convinced they would work . Social Security is saved , and without intergenerational warfare . Then you happen upon the prize in this Cracker Jack box . <p> Like many people today , Beard is disturbed by inequality of income distribution and the low savings rate that keeps people from accumulating any wealth . He points out that a family income of $ 50,000 , a sum higher than what 's earned by 75 percent of the population , affords very little money leftover for savings after mortgage payments , auto installments , taxes and other expenses . <p> But , Beard points out , an American with pay no higher than $ 10,000 a year is today required to put $ 23.85 a week , or $ 1,240 a year , into Social Security . If that American saved that amount at market rates from age 20 to age 65 , compound interest would make him a millionaire at retirement . Even with inflation eating away at the buying power of his savings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working life . Unless the United States encounters an economic catastrophe , the whole working population could be relatively rich under the Beard system by the middle of the next century . <p> Beard 's is not the only plan out there , and he is chiefly interested in starting a national debate on the concepts he outlines . He is convinced - and so am I - that some such answer is absolutely required , though the recent failure to alter Medicare 's structure does not offer much hope . The shame is that politicians are mainly shying away from this sort of discussion and that lobbying groups from the elderly are irrationally wedded to the status quo . The dragon may destroy us yet . <p> NOTES : Ambrose , based in Washington , D.C. , is chief editorial writer for Scripps Howard News Service .
