The Roller-Skating Question . Let me add my voice to your other correspondents In protest against unrestricted roller skating on the sidewalks , also against those pernicious roller coasters the boys make by nailing a few rollers onto a wooden box . I should not like to have the boys Prevented front roller skating , for it is ex. - cellent , healthy exercise , and should be encouraged : - but it seems generally to be for -- gotten that men and women who have to walk and work have some rights as well as children . Even in Central Park , where one should be relieved of racket and turmoil . the children monopolize the walks with roller skating and soap-box coasters . The soapbox roller coasters should not be allowed to operate at IS since they are of no benefit whatever to anybody ; but the roller skating should not be . stopped . There certainly must be some means of providing for this necessary ? exercise for the boys and girls without giving everybody else in the city a headache .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
