Next to Negroes ( but a long way behind them ) , white Southern youngsters are the most inventive and dextrous dancers in the U. S. They work hard at their fun , and to " shine , " or perform so as to attract attention , is accounted worthy . Last spring , at a prom at the University of South Carolina , a dance was launched which promised to give Southerners more scope for shining than they had ever enjoyed before . It was called " The Big Apple . " A party of students had seen Negroes cavorting through its steps in the " Big Apple Night Club , " a onetime synagog in Columbia , had given the name to the dance and practiced it secretly for their prom .

Fundamental step is a hop similar to the Lindy Hop . In the words of Variety , " it requires a lot of floating power and fanny-ing .

The Big Apple invariably ends upon a somewhat reverent note , with everybody leaning back and raising his arms heavenward . This movement is called " Praise Allah . " Through it all , the " caller " shouts continuously- " Truck to the right . . . . Reverse it . . . . To the left . . . . In place . . . . Stomp that right foot . . . . Swing it . . . . All right , shine . . . . Suzi-Q to the right . . . . Praise Allah . " <P> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South appeared in Manhattan at the Roxy Theatre .
