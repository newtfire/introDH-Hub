Anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon 's first view of the Yanomamo Indians was partially obscured by a number of drawn arrows aimed at his face . The archers had huge wads of green tobacco jammed between their teeth and lower lips . Long streams of green mucus hung from their noses-the normal flow from a hallucinogenic drug that makes the normally aggressive Yanomamo even more touchy and menacing . <P> Though the Indians decided to spare Chagnon , who was then 24 and working on a Ph.D . at the University of Michigan , he immediately lost all illusions about noble savages . <P> That was in 1964 . Chagnon eventually stayed 15 months with the 15,000-member tribe , which is spread out over 75,000 square miles in southern Venezuela and northern Brazil . Since then , Chagnon , now a Penn State professor , has spent four years among the Yanomamo , learning the language and chronicling a culture built around persistent aggression-browbeating , goading , ritual displays of ferocity , fighting and constant warfare . One village he visited conducted 25 wars in 19 months against neighboring villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in battle . <P> Chagnon 's findings are anything but quaint notes on a primitive people . For one thing , the Yanomamo culture challenges the reigning academic theory that primitive wars are mainly fought over land , water or some other natural resource . What makes the Yanomamo anthropologically interesting is that all their wars are waged to capture women or in retaliation for such abductions . <P> Like many primitive peoples , the Yanomamo practice female infanticide - on the grounds that males are more valuable to a people always at war . Yet infanticide sets up fierce competition for marriageable females , both within and among villages , and this in turn produces chronic warfare . <P> Implied in Chagnon 's findings so far is a notion startling to traditional anthropology : the rather horrifying Yanomamo culture makes some sense in terms of animal behavior . Chagnon argues that Yanomamo structures closely parallel those of many primates in breeding patterns , competition for females and recognition of relatives . Like baboon troops , Yanomamo villages tend to split into two after they reach a certain size . <P> Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most children . Says Chagnon : " What the Yanomamo are doing makes a good deal of sense if you view it as a strategy to maintain reproductive fitness . " The winners in Yanomamo wars - the largest villages-have the highest birth rates and the most inbreeding . <P> Long Effort . In Darwinian terms , animals compete for the unwitting purpose of getting as many of their genes as possible into the next generation . " In primates and all mammals , " says Chagnon , " internal social organization results from the breeding system , and there 's no reason to believe it 's not true of humans . It 's possible that war and marriage make sense in zoological terms , and Darwinian theory is applicable to human behavior. "
