Since 1921 , when Louisiana-born John Lee Denson broke into journalism at 16 on the Washington Herald , he has shown an itch to stay on the move . Along the years , Denson has drifted through assorted editorial posts on five magazines , a press wire service , a radio network and five newspapers in Chicago , Washington and New York . <P> In January 1953 , he went to work as special writer for Newsweek , within ten months was managing editor . He rose to editor in 1956 , seemed to have settled down for the first time in his career . But last week lean and peripatetic Denson , 55 , moved once more . His new assignment : editor of the New York Herald Tribune . " Like coming home , " said Denson , who in his 20s worked in the Tub 's Washington bureau . <P> Denson 's appointment was a surprise to Trib staffers , although his name had come up nearly two years ago , the first time Multimillionaire John Hay Whitney , then U.S. Ambassador to the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the paper he had just bought . He passed over several prospects to pick Robert M. White II , 45 , co-publisher of the Mexico , Mo. , Ledger ( circ. 9,122 ) . White , who never quite mastered the transition from Mexico to Manhattan , resigned last November . <P> Denson , a gentle fellow beneath an irascible exterior , goes for splash in editing . At Newsweek he was generally credited with the makeup technique that makes lavish use of arrows , circles and boxes , as well as pictures that make their point by having Xs drawn across faces ( to indicate a man has lost power ) and the unsettling practice of blowing up a man 's features by cutting off his ears or his hairline . Said Denson : " Naturally , I regret leaving Newsweek after so many satisfying years . " <P> On the Tribune , Editor Denson may find his love for daily journalism put to a stern test , though he does n't say so : " There has already been too much talk about ' saving the Tribune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " Still a good daily , the Trib has fallen into an unprofitable trough between the towering New York Times ( circ. 644,175 ) , which has most of the class circulation , and the tabloid Daily News ( 2,021,395 ) . The Sunday Trib is even more in need of rehabilitation - which may be one reason Whitney picked a magazine man .
