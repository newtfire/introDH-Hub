Some raging legal storms are about to batter federal school desegregation guideposts in Dixie . At least three Deep South states plan to unleash attacks against tightened federal standards . South Carolina already has brought suit against the guidelines . And Georgia 's Gov . Carl Sanders says his state is mulling legal action aimed at nullifying them . Alabama 's Gov . George C. Wallace also is stirring up a typhoon . He has asked the Alabama Legislature to declare the guidelines " null and void . " Moreover , he wants all compliances already signed by local school boards invalidated . He would have the state reimburse any school district that loses federal funds for refusing to hew to the federal guideposts . He also would permit local boards to empower the governor and the Legislature to deal for them with the United States Office of Education . He has introduced a bill to do all those things . Educators are battening down for a real blow . When school buzzers ring in Georgia next month the major absentee will be the teacher . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Board of . Education officials estimate its 195 school systems will open 1,190 teachers short . Elementary teachers , especially , will be too few . The state , because of this , may have to lower its standards for teacher certification . Educators attribute this mostly to the state 's low starting teacher salaries . Both neighboring Alabama and Florida pay beginning teachers more . Both will land many of the new teachers graduating this year from Georgia colleges . The only local Georgia schools that will open this September with full teaching complements are those that supplement state teacher salaries somehow . e . Virginia intends to try to plug its educa ? tion gap . The state 's poorer school systems , largely the rural ones , lag far behind the more lavishly funded urban ones . Virginia 's State Board of Education this week assembled the machinery for a complete committee study of ways to bridge that gap . The committee , stilt unnamed , must make its report in January . What it reports is likely to be translated into legislation and made a mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the new state sales tax to be funneled off into educational gap filling . But most Virginia experts think more than just money may be needed : For instance , shrewder use of state authority to insure good schools in the country as well as the city . Trends ... A former Governor is coming from 20 years back in Georgia 's political past to run again . And he may win . Ellis Arnall , a Democrat , first sat in the governor 's seat in 1943 . He left it in 1947 to practice law and amass a small fortune . He also wrote a book , " The Shore Dimly Seen . " , which was keenly critical of Georgia and its politics . Many old-timers have never for ; iven him . But now he is rated by nearly all the poitical polls as the favorite to carry the Demicratic primary Sept. 14 . He may even win without a runoff . If so , he will face Rep. Howard H. ( 13o ) 7allaway in November , the first Republican o run for governor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allaway will win a whopping vote and per-taps even the election . Many Georgians reent the national Democratic Party 's civilights program . It seems to be a question whether Georgia caches back 20 years for a returning Demo-rat or back nearly a century for a Republian . Pressures are building in South Carolina p seal off party boundaries to crossing trate . Legions of voters , who may or may not ote Democratic in November , balloted in le party 's primary in June . There was so such crossing over that at least one county executive committee ( York ) now is pressig the General Assembly to make regis  --  ants state their political preference . Then ley would have to vote in that party 's prilary , crossing over only in the general elecon . As it now is , registrants can crisscross rimary lines at will  --  and did last June . any Republicans are said to have voted masse in the Democratic Party primary 1r a man they thought would be easier to at in the general . eproduced with permission of the copyright owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
