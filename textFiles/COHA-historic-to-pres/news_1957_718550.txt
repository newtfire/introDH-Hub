Greece is demanding self-government or free administration , and eventual self-determination or enosis ( annexation ) with Greece for the 380,000 Greeks on Cyprus . Turkey is working to prevent the application of a formula that would forcibly bring the Turks on Cyprus under an administration that they do not want and thus leave them no alternative but to abandon their homes . In short , it is only natural that the right of self-determination should be recognized also for the Turks . Thus it becomes evident that Turkey is neither a supporter of continued British colonial rule on Cyprus , nor opposed to self-determination on the condition that this is applied in an equitable manner . What is the conceivable form of a just solution ? Agreement on Partition Speaking in the British House of Commons , Secretary Alan LennoxBoyd put forward the matter of partition as one possibility . Despite the fact that such a course of action would constitute an important sacrifice from the viewpoint of ' Iturkey 's security for reasons which I shall enumerate below , Turkish Premier Menderes agreed to partition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave lack of security stemming from the Cyprus dispute that is permeating NATO , the Baghdad Pact and the Western security system as a whole . The second consideration which makes it imperative for Turkey to ' be vitally concerned in the matter of Cyprus lies in the fact that because of its physical formation and geographic location the island is a portion of Turkish Anatolia . A glance at the map suffices to prove the point that Cyprus is to Turkey what Long Island is to New York . It is common knowledge that Turkey is a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides . The defense of this island gives rise to problems of extraordinary complexity ; and from the military viewpoint it is obvious that the country in possession of Cyprus is enabled to exert primary influence on the security of Turkey . Let us consider two eventualities : In the event of Cyprus falling into the hands of a power opposed to Turkey and to the community of which Turkey is a member , this development would completely upset the present balance . ? Because the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety for its southern coastline . Defense Commitments But should this situation change tomorrow , would it not become selfapparent that Turkey would find it imperative to review all military and ? political commitments ? And , arising out of her commitments with respect to NATO , the Baghdad Pact and other obligations would Turkey not find herself burdened with a load far beyond her capacity ? Consider another possibility , that of Cyprus falling into the hands of another state ( such as Greece , for example ) which , although friendly , does not possess the means of defending the island in the , event of a probable world war . In such an eventuality Turkey 's security would ' become fraught with the dangers to which I have already alluded . It is evident that while working on the one hand to preserve the liberal provisions of the United Nations Charter in the matter of Cyprus , on the other Turkey is working to insure the application of those provisions of that same Charter which are relative to the preservation of general peace and tranquility In this troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the last U. N. Assembly . That is why Turkey has always urged that the parties concerned should sit down around the same table instead of resorting to terrorism and summarily rejecting all attempts at negotiation . We hope most sincerely that in Greece also chauvinistic nationalist sentiment and demagogic tendencies will yield to a mentality that is dedicated to the preservation A true interests and of the ideals to which we are all attached . This will make it possible to resolve the Cyprus question and give new strength to old friendships in this , art ? of the world . NIHAT New York , Feb. 8 , 1957 . The writer of the following letter , former Deputy Premier , was delegated by Turkish Premier Adnan Menderes to the London discussion on a draft constitution for Cyprus. - He is a member of the special delegation for Cyprus at the U. N. To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read with interest Wayne Phillips ' report in The Times of Feb. , 7 on the press ? interview held by our delegation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches the Cyprus problem , I would like to define the situation once again . The island of Cyprus is of vital concern to Turkey from two major points of view . The first of these considerations is the fact that there is a population of 120,000 Turks living on the island . In this connection it is well to remember that the 300,000 Cypriote Turks presently living in Turkey are not included in this fi re gu . from making secret agreements that would be dangerous to our national interests . Basically the Bricker amendment carries no axe , but rather brick and putty , to our national binder . It underlines a sentiment . We regret the necessity for such an amendment but we could live to regret its absence with far worse results . , There is such a thing as a spirit of America , which quickly outlives such a fallacy as the " spirit of Geneva . " No mere personality car ? ries it forward , but rather public action . Witness if you will the tremendous protest that the proposed Tito visit brought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for defense , but not one cent for tribute . " suggest to you that the prin-4 cipies that produced the Constitution and the amendment are our only safeguard against a potential " Big Brother-1984 type existence . " CLIFFORD R. ENSSLIN . Union City , N. J. , Jan. 30 , 1957 : Heart Research Aid Asked Support by All Americans of Heart Fund Is Advocated To THE EDITOR OF TH E NEW YORK TIME , B : A President had polio , and ' a March of Dimes research program ( $957 collected per victim annually ) i has practically licked polio . Another President has had heart disease . If because of this  --  the moneys collected for heart research can be advanced from $1.20 annually per victim , which it is today , to $957. perhaps we will lick heart disease too . It so happens that the money someone gave for research in heart disease and heart surgery saved the life of the writer when he was at the point of death . You can understand why I want to aid in whatever way I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . I am not unique in this respect According to a reliable source there are 100,000 persons in the United States today who have had heart surgery , and the majority of these feel similarly obligated . The feeling is especially strong among the 2,000 such persons banded together in a nationwide organization called " Mended Hearts . " Polio has a particular appeal for parents , especially mothers . The same women can be led to'see that the conquest of heart disease wlil reduce their chance of premature widowhood , There is also a matter of basic economics : the better able a wife is to take care of her husband , particularly with respect to his heart , the better able will her husband be to take care of her , and the longer . There are many to be helped : 10 , - 000,000 persons in this country cur , . rently have heart disease in some form ( one out of sixteen ) , including 500,000 children of school age . In 1955 diseases ' of the heart and cir-4 culation were responsible for 53 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who died , 29 per cent were under 65 . It is because of research in heart disease that a famous President who had a heart attack also made a dramatic return to the living . Woud n't it be a wonderful thing if , in his name , all Americans rallied to support the Heart Fund and it ? snowballed into a great victory over cardiac illnesses ? GEORGE LAWTON , New York , Feb. 6 , 1957 . For Safer Night Driving To THE EDITOR OF THE New York Miss : I was happy to see that you found the decision of the authorities to lighten a section of she Connecticut Turnpike of sufficient importance tcl comment favorably on it in an editorial on Feb. 4 . As you state , lack of visibility is one of the prime causes of road accidents . To counteract the heck of visibility at night the motorist ' is apt to use the brightest lights ' at his disposal . The glare of these lights will in turn make vision rather deficient . One accepted way to counteract the glare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of the road , away from the glare on the left . Only too frequently the edge of the road , however , is approximately the same color as the dirt at the road 's border . At night it IS very difficult , indeed , to determine where the concrete ends and the dirt begins . A clear white line marking the edge of the road on either side would add considerably to the safety of night driving . This measure is simple , inexpensive and entirely obvious . It seems that in traffic , as in many other fields , the simple and obvious is frequently overlooked . White lines marking the lanes and the edges of the highway should be standard on all highways .
