Relations between India and the U.S.-uneven at best in recent years-turned worse last week . Reason : <P> Washington lifted its decade-old arms embargo on Pakistan , paving the way for Islamabad to buy antitank and anti aircraft missiles , as well as multipurpose fighter-bombers , on a cash basis . In return , there is speculation that Pakistan may give the U.S. a naval base at the Arabian Sea port of Gwador . <P> The arms-embargo decision had been more or less expected ever since Pakistan Premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto 's visit to Washington last month . Essentially , the Administration 's rationale for lifting an embargo that has applied to all countries of the subcontinent since 1965 was that 1 ) Pakistan , which was Henry Kissinger 's bridge to a rapprochement with China in 1971 , has proved itself a good friend to Washington ; 2 ) India , in addition to manufacturing its own arms , receives sophisticated weaponry from the Soviet Union , giving it virtual military dominance over the subcontinent ; and 3 ) Bhutto warned Washington that Pakistan might try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the U.S. did not assist it in acquiring more up-to-date weapons . <P> India , which technically can also buy U.S. arms now , though it is unlikely to do so , reacted immediately and bitterly to the Washington move . Prime Minister Indira Gandhi spoke out against " Pakistan 's new belligerence , " and at week 's end visiting Soviet Defense Minister Andrei Grechko joined with New Delhi in a communique ex pressing " grave anxiety at the actions taken by certain quarters to step up the arms race . " Indian Foreign Minister Y.B. Chavan , who was scheduled to pre side with Kissinger over the first meeting of an Indo-U.S . Joint Commission that had been set up to improve ties , canceled out . <P> New Delhi 's angry response to the embargo repeal was inspired in part by a feeling that Pakistan would not have attacked India during the 1965 and 1971 wars unless it had been well supplied with American arms . <P> Whatever the reason , India 's resentment about what it feels is a renewed Washington " tilt " toward Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. new Ambassador to India , who was in Bangkok when the embargo was lifted . Saxbe went to some pains to point out that he opposed the Administration 's decision , although he said he was obliged to support it . Even though ranking State Department officials are confident that the storm " will blow over pretty soon , " the spectacle of the U.S. ambassador sightseeing in Thailand to delay taking up his post in India is a poor omen for his tenure .
