The smiling astronaut is holding aloft not some extraterrestrial beach ball but NASA 's new passenger " rescue ball . " Now under construction for the space shuttle , which is scheduled to make its first orbital flight in 1979 , the ball would be available for transferring passengers to rescue craft in case the shuttle is marooned in space . Because they will not be equipped with the expensive space suits that are now being considered for the shuttle , passengers could zip themselves into the cheaper , airtight ball . As they crouch in fetal position , the ball , made of layers of synthetic fabrics , will be inflated with pure oxygen to its full 34-in. diameter . The passenger may find it a tight fit , but he ( or she ) will be able to look out on the world through a small peephole as the ball is towed by an astronaut in the weightlessness of space to the other ship or conveyed by a clothesline-like transfer system similar to that used by vessels at sea .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
