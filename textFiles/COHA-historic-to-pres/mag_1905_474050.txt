IN a glass case at the Royal College of Physicians , in London , there reposes , and has reposed since 1825 , a curious relic of English medical science in the seventeenth century , ? the gold-headed cane which the famous Dr. Radcliffe used to carry with him whenever he was driven down to Kensington Palace to feel the pulse of kings and queens . When he died , Radcliffe left this cane to the most brilliant and most devoted of his younger contemporaries , Dr. Richard Mead , who carried it about with him until the close of his useful life , when his successor bore it . It is unlike all other known physicians ' canes of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in that , instead of a metal knob containing a cavity for aromatic vinegar ? to protect against deadly smells and infections , ? the gold head takes the form of a crossbar . It was specially made to the order of the most original and imperious doctor of his day , in defiance of tradition and custom ; and in the angularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts and the tempers which made Dr. Radcliffe alternately doted on and rejected by a succession of royal patients . Whatever regrets we may feel for the romantic surroundings of life two hundred years ago , there is certainly not one of us who is unwell who can wish to be transplanted to the seventeenth century . It is true that medical science was beginning to make rapid progress , but in the practical part of the business there was a vast need of improvement . The physicians of the day were empirical and they were rough . Voltaire said that doctors poured drugs of which they knew little into human bodies of which they knew less , and what was true in 1750 had been trebly true in 1650 . We know that the dramatists ' made ceaseless fun of the doctors , and their gibes were not ill-deserved .. , , , The professional conditions of the exercise of medicine were not yet fixed , and the genuine physician was hampered by the existence of legions of quacks , with whom the law was almost powerless to deal . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic dresses , seated in a velvet chair , with a dried crocodile hanging over their heads , and the celestial and terrestrial globes on either hand . The vogue of these popular quacks was greatly encouraged by the pomposity and exclusiveness of the regular practitioners . There were very good men , of course , among these latter , but the tendency was not favorable to the finest virtue . Down to the Restoration there was nothing that could compare with the honorable abnegation of a modern country practitioner . The physician had little or no private practice among people who could not pay him , and the element of pity had hardly come into existence . The most successful members of the profession were those who secured the most fashionable practice , and no doctor was expected to waste an hour of his time over a patient who The apothecary was willing and even anxious to draw up prescriptions himself , nod to persuade his clients that it was - useless to apply to a doctor at all . For their own advantage , therefore , as well as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prescribe gratis at the London hospitals , and to supply medicines at cost-price . In 1:688 a public dispensary was opened in Warwick Lane , but the apothecaries were so powerful that this charity was practically stifled , and it was not until 1097 that it was started on a firm basis by the active and benevolent Sir Samuel Garth . It was about the same year that Dr. Richard Short surprised the town by attending the sick poor in their own cellars and garrets ? a thing that had never before been attempted . When this estimable man died , in 1708 , his death was attributed to these unselfish labors in visiting the sick . ? An amiable poet , whose " soft Ovidian verse " was admired by two generations ? those of Dryden and of Pope , ? Garth was physician in ordinary to George I. From early times kings had had doctors attached to their persons , and in the seventeenth century it became the reasonable ambition of every clever young physician to climb , through some aristocratic connection , to court itself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from adopting a curious attitude of independence that seems out of harmony with the obsequiousness which was cultivated in high social circles . When James I. sent for Dr. William Butter to attend him in sudden illness at Newmarket , the distinguished practitioner was very unwilling to come . Persuaded at last that he must , he rode out of Cambridge with the soldier who had been sent to fetch him at his side . When they had gone half-way , Dr. Butler pretended to pause for some purpose , and bolted home as fast as he could . The messenger galloped after him and caught him , and snaking die doctor ride in front , kept the point of his halberd in the small of his back until he had convoyed him safely to the bedside of royalty . Much of this rough reluctance marked the conduct of the great Dr. John Radcliffe , who , among so many learned and famous men , takes his place at the head of all English practitioners at the close of the seventeenth century . He was , without doubt , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mightily vexed by the ill doings of his neighbors . He did not bear fools gladly , nor did he hasten to put the best possible construction on what his learned brethren did or failed to do . There was a very rough edge to RadelitTe 's tongue , and he did not hesitate to use it . He used it towards his rival as a court doctor , Dr. William Gibbons , whom he had haled from his undergraduate days . But it is not Radcliffe , but Radcliffe 's eminent political opponent , Garth , who says the cruelest things of Gibbous . The latter was supposed to let his patients slip through his fingers , and it is Garth , not Radeliffe , who makes Gibbons say : Radcliffe had quarrelled with Gibbons and called him an " old Nurse " when they were young men together at Oxford during the Civil War , and he had had the mortification of seeing the hated rival rise to the height of a fashionable practice . Like Sydenham , Radcliffe ridiculed the lectures in Galen and Hippocrates , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got at Oxford in those days , and he did much i.e enlarge the field of medical teaching in England and make it practical . He was an uncompromising bear , growling at everything and everybody . In 1077 he was kept out of a faculty in Lincoln College because he had jeered at the rector 's fondness for Gothic studies . Master Radcliffe had his joke and lust his faculty . But when en epidemic of smallpox broke over Oxford , the young man showed his genius , and the curing of a certain Lady Spencer made his fame , He came up to London , where . Dr. Richard Lower " was esteemed the most noted physician in London and Westminster , " but in those days politics had all to do with a court doctor 's success . Dr. Lower got mixed up with the Titus Oates Plot , and joined the Whigs in 1678 . This was Radcliffe 's chance , and , a very vigorous , ambitious , and undaunted young fellow of eight-and-twenty , he struck a blow for Lower 's practice and , secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the career of Radcliffe is found in a diverting volume , now quite scarce , published in 1715 by a man called William Pittis ? rather a disreputable hack-writer , who had stood three times in the pillory . The portrait he gives of Radcliffeis extremely interesting and curious as that of a great leader of physic towards the end of the seventeenth century . We learn that by 1684 that is to say , only some six years after he came up to London ? Radcliffe was substantially wealthy , and lie was able to do what it is generally supposed was invented by Gull two centuries later , namely , insist on being paid two ' guineas instead of one for a consultation . If lie was sent for from the country , he charged twenty guineas a day , and in the time of his great celebrity he seems to have made this charge for a single town visit . No wonder that , though he died comparatively early and spent largely , he left a fortune of ? 100,000 ? a very large sum indeed in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of his clients who were not offended by it . When he perceived , however , that his company was only required that he might act as a buffoon , he had ready ways of revenging himself , and a delightful talc is told of his mode of dealing with a noble lord who had nothing the matter with him , and who sent for Radcliffe to be entertained by his conversation . The reply he made was witty and final , but can not be repeated . Radcliffe rose but slowly into the highest practice . At last he had the opportunity of curing two of the favorites of King William III. , who doted upon those whom he admitted to his intimacy . At this moment the favor of the Orange court was open to him , but Radcliffe had the prudence to draw back , not choosing , so Pittis conjectures , " to declare himself in that ticklish state of public affairs . " A DOCTOR TO KINGS . 177 He became , however , body-physician to the Princess of Denmark , and , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor . He was famous , beyond all other doctors of his time , for his skill in treating asthma , and although William III . never really liked his rough tongue , a complication of ailments forced the King to consult him . On one occasion , we are quaintly told , he saved the King 's life by " keeping him spitting for the space of half a quarter of an hour . " The King 's sister , afterwards Queen Anne , ? a narrow-minded and dictatorial woman , ? disliked Radcliffe from the first , but she was obliged to employ him for herself , and then for the sickly succession of her children . Queen Mary gave him , in 1691 , a fee of 1000 guineas for having prolonged a little the life of her royal nephew , the Duke of Gloucester , who would have been King of England , perhaps , if his mother had not given way to temper and dismissed the great doctor . When Queen Mary herself was dangerously ill with smallpox , Radcliffe was not consulted until too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , Radcliffe was implored to take up the case , but he refused , saying that he did not need to sec more than the doctors ' prescriptions to know that she was virtually a dead woman , whom nothing could save from the results of " unskilful hands " and " improper medicines . " This was not courtly ; and still less obsequious was Radcliffe to the Princess Anne , who sent for him , only to be told that " your Highness 's distemper is nothing but the vapors , and you are in as good a state of health as any woman breathing . " Anne immediately dismissed him , and sent for the hated rival , " Nurse " Gibbons , nor when she came to the throne did she forget the affront . William Ill. , however , learned to value Radcliffc 's skill , and to forgive his surly tongue ; and when he cured the Earl of Albemarle in 1695 , the King offered to make him a baronet . Radcliffe characteristically , but not graciously , replied that a baronet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Extraordinary were the liberties which Radcliffe took with William III. , who came at last to depend upon him implicitly . But the doctor 's tongue went too far at last , for early in 1700 the King , being in distress with dropsy , bid Radcliffe examine his ankles and say what he thought of them . The doctor roughly replied , " Why , truly , I would not have your two legs for your three kingdoms . " This was too much , and Radcliffe was banished from court . As be went , by way of an agreeable com ? pInnent , he predicted the date of the King 's speedy death , mill he predicted it correctly . When Anne came to the throne she DR . RICHARD MEAD ( .1673-175Q Painted by Allan Ramsay did not forget her deep resentment against the bold physician . Urged by the Earl of Godolphin to consult him for the gout , she said that if she did so , Dr. Radcliffe would not come to see her , but would send her a message " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those about the Queen , however , continued to consult him privately , " behind the curtains , " although she would never see him . At last , when her unhappy husband , Prince George , was in the agonies of death , the Queen consented to call for Radcliffe , and promised him every favor he could ask for . He came , but bluntly told her that the Prince 's disease had been treated so unskilfully " that nothing but death could relieve his Royal Highness , " and refused to go to the Prince 's bedside . He consented . howe ? er , to gi ve an alleviating proseripI ion , and in his former Qbliging manner predicted , correctly , the day on which the patient would die . The culmination , however , of Radcliffe 's amazing independence was reached when Queen Anne herself was stricken with mortal illness . It is not quite certain what did actually happen upon this occasion , for con-dieting stories are told in the memoirs of the times . But it seems clear that again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to du without Radcliffe until it was too late . In a letter of his own he excuses himself for not going to the Queen when he was summoned by saying , " I know the nature of attending crowned heads , in their last moments , too well to be fond of waiting upon them without being sent for by a proper authority . " According to one account , he replied to the order of Council that it would be time enough to wait upon her Majesty the next day . Pittis says that he knew the Queen 's case was desperate , and did not think it at all proper to disturb her " in her last moments . " At any rate , he did not go , and Queen Anne died . The popular cry imputed Queen Anne 's death , most unfairly , to Dr. Radcliffe 's neglect . His former friend , Sir John Pakington , moved in the House of Commons that the physician should be summoned to the bar . This was not done , but Radcliffe received several anonymous letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be torn . in pieces , and his terror of being murdered brought on a fit of apopleXy , from , which he died on the 1st of November , 1714.
