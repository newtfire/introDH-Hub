That Justice Robert Jackson had made a great speech when he opened the Nrnberg trial , the world already knew . Just how great it was the world saw more clearly last week when Sir Hartley William Shawcross , Britain 's Attorney General , opened the case for the British prosecution . Sir Hartley is one of Britain 's most brilliant jurists . His day-long speech was an impressive , tightly logical , exhaustive dissertation . Yet rarely did it match Jackson 's bold attempt to find law in ultimate source-the principles of men- rather than in statute , treaty , precedent . <P> It was largely a matter of emphasis . Both lawyers pointed to the sheaf of treaties which nations had signed and sealed through the years , in the anxious hope of banning war . But Sir Hartley interpreted the treaties as laws that applied to individuals , even though everyone knew that they were not meant to be so applied . <P> The American had probed beneath surface technicalities . To him , the violation of international treaties was an aggravating circumstance ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? . German-Polish non-aggression pact . The treaties ' existence was important to Jackson chiefly as a symptom that the world 's conscience had begun to view aggression and war as evils that must be punished . Said he : " Plain people ... revolted at such fictions as war 's legality and legalisms so contrary to ethical principles , and demanded checks on war immunity . . . . "
